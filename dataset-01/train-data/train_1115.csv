4,Digital Survival Kit Swabs,Swabs worked well but I needed a second kit. I had several tough dust particles on my sensor that were pretty stubborn. Still 2 of these kits cost no more than other cleaning systems.
4,"Neat little pack, Shame about the quantity though","Excellent if you want to carry cleaning supplies around with you or you just want something portable.Got my sensor clean in no time (you do have to get the hang of it first though)This is exactly why I give it 4 stars. You are a GOD if you manage to properly use the swabs the first time around. This pack doesnt bring much, so be careful!"
5,Sensor cleaner,The sensor cleaning swabs are perfect fit for the Canon Rebel I use. It has removed the annoying dust spots I had on my photos.
4,Digi Survivor Kit,"The sensor swabs are great, and work as planned. There are some other clothes and fluid in the pouch that don't have instructions (I am assuming they are for a lens). I always use a microfiber cloth and it works great. Ideally I would like ot buy a pouch with just the swabs."
1,Get it done professionally,"All this kit did was make the problem worse. I had but a couple spots show up on shots that included sky which I could remedy with some post processing. But tiring of that with every shot I thought I'd try cleaning the sensor. I first blew out the remaining dust with a Giotto then ran the moistened swab over the sensor. Took a sky shot and saw twice the dust on the image! I eventually used all the swabs with the problem growing worse every time. Apparently the swabs are far from lint free, themselves. After blowing $20 on this kit it looks like I'll have to spend another $50 to get it done right by a professional, which is what I should have done in the first place. Good luck if you should attempt this yourself."
4,Works with some effort,"Over the past couple of years my Canon 20D had developed some pretty bad dust spots. Did some research and settled on buying this kit, primarily for the sensor cleaners. It took me two applicators, about eight attempts, and almost an hour but eventually I was able to get all of the dust spots removed. Sensor looks great at this point. Overall, it wasn't difficult to clean, just took a little longer than I would have liked. Good product. Much cheaper than professional cleaning."
2,Not worth the risk,"For just a little more than the price of this product, you can have your sensor professionally cleaned by your local dealer. I made the mistake of deciding to do it myself and ended up with a scratched sensor filter thanks to a plastic burr on the very first swab I tried -- what awful quality control on a product meant to clean the most expensive part of an expensive camera body."
1,Hopeless Product.,"I own Nikon D300 since 2008, and I see spots and speckles on my Photos and when I was looking for solutions to remove the same. When I went to a camera shop, they suggested a air blower(I bought the air blower and eventually, did not clean the CCD) and asked me to look for CCD cleaning Swabs and I bought the swabs here in Amazon.When I tried to clean them, it did not clean well and I put more lints on my CCD and I had to use all 4-swabs in this pack, still the CCD is not fully cleaned. I am planning to give my camera for service.1. It did not clean the CCD2. Put more lint on my CCD"
3,"used all 4, but they've done their job","I've used all 4 swabs to get the job done. There are still two small marks on the sensor, but it's definitely better than what was before. Too expensive though."
5,Works exactly as it says!,"You do have to take your time, and you do need a very good, close up light, but the swipe size and the cleaning chemical works perfectly. $80 for a camera dealer to clean the sensor once, or buy this kit and do it whenever you want for so much less. Works great!"
4,Worked fine,"I had dust or dirt on my sensor and it left spots on every image. The camera dust removal did not work, nor did a blower and very soft brush. This kit did the job however, and earned my recommendation."
4,"Over priced for what it is, but it works as advertised.",If you're lazy like me and don't feel like making your own sensor cleaner than this is the product for you. I hate to give it 4 stars because its so simple and can't cost them more than .75 cents to manufacture. But I cleaned my sensor with it and it looked good. Got rid of all my dark spots. I had one spot in the corner that was kinda tricky to get rid of but after using 3 swabs I finally got it and didn't damage anything. Prob would have been better off just leaving it there but I really wanted my sensor perfect. One swipe got 99% of my spots.
4,did the trick but needs more swabs.,the case is very handy for holding your sensor and lens cleaning essentials together.I had a fairly dirty sensor and was able to clean it quite well. the only negative is this kit only givesyou 4 swabs and it took that many to remove my collected dust and grime. my sensor is clean but now I have to order more swabs to have at the ready.it is still cheaper than a professional cleaning so I'm happy.
4,Have not used this item yet,"I realize that my four star review means nothing until I actually use this item. However everything included in this kit appears to be top of the line, considering its purpose in sensor cleaning."
2,Does not work as described,"Based on some 4 and 5 starts reviews, I was expecting more. I had some oil over the sensor. I had to clean it up 3 times and it still has a small spot of oil remaining. It's a 5 fl oz bottle with alcohol, 4 swabs e 10 pec-pad for $21. If it cleaned how described I'd have had no problems with the cost and would've given 5 start."
3,Get's the job done,"This is the second time buying this product to clean out dust from my Canon 20D (which unfortunately does not come equipped with the auto sensor clean feature the new cameras have.) The first time I used this product, I had to go through a few swabs because it was not getting all of the dirt off. This time around, same thing. I don't know if the dirt got caked on there, which I highly doubt because I never have the sensor exposed or if it's the actual swabs.All I know is that if I had a newer camera and if I was not on a college student budget, I would send in my camera to the manufacturer or a shop where they can do it professionally and clean it out completely. If you scratch the sensor your camera will be useless."
2,So Far So Good,Does what it is supposed to. Removed the dust from my D7000 that the air blower couldn't remove. Stressful? Yes. Successful? Yes.
1,expensive and not worth it,"tried several times with no results.Too make sure I was doing it right, I checked several videos on you- tube. All the methods were pretty much the same. I suppose some people have had success with this product but not here. as i said before and after reading other reviews I attemted several times to get some of the specks and dust out But I saw no results . The price paid for this product seemed High to start with , so I thought mabey it would be a valuable tool and save me some down time with my camera by doing it on my own. Other than the expense paid for this product I wouldnt have anything to loose. well to make a long story short. Take your Camera to your local Camera repairman and have it professionally done.Save your $$20.00"
3,is what it is,Works as described not that impressed with the contents of the kit could give more lens paper
4,If only they had told me!,"Great little stand for the money. However, not little enough! My son's trombone is not a full sized instrument, and the bell of the instrument would not sit deep over the top of the stand causing it to wobble precariously. Unfortunately, we had to return it."
5,Command & Conquer : The Covert Operations,Bought this for my collection . Makes good addition to my C & C games .Add this to your purchase .
3,Good Album but Not Essential,"I picked this cd up at local show becuase a friend told me they were good. Well I am not sure what all the fuss is about this band because to me they sound pretty generic. Yes, this is a good cd but I rarely listen to it when there are much better bands out there. Unfortunately I have missed many opportunitys to see this band live due to school work or vacation or whatnot. Maybe if I ever do see them live then my opinion will go up becuase I have heard that put on a good show so we'll see. Anyway if you're really into hardcore then you'll probably enjoy this, but if you like metal more then I probably wouldn't recommend it."
5,A Whitman's Sampler of literary confections,"Filled with unique tales, off-beat humor, memorable characters, and skillful writing, ""One Day Closer To Death"" is a Whitman's Sampler of literary confections. And, though tours of his home will be discouraged, Bradley Denton should be declared a state treasure. (copyright 1998, San Antonio Express-News)"
3,"Not one of their greatest, but not bad either","Not one of their greatest, but not bad either. Believe me, Hip-Hop has taken a turn for the worse and these guys still hold their head well above water"
4,Hondo & Fabian,"Dear Reader,I would rate this item 5. This book is about a cat and dog.The dog woid go to the beach with his freind. And the cat would play with a baby.I really like the book because I own a dog myself.The firs time I read it it made me hink of my dog.This book is not much but is veary tochful if you owna dog or cator both. You should read it to.From,Sam"
2,Beautiful Art - Very Weak Story,"I bought this book based upon its previous glowing reviews, however after reading several Rainy Dohaney books, this just doesn't stack up.The artwork is beautiful, but this book is not engaging enough for any child over the age of 20 months or so. My 3 1/2 year old liked the art, but was bored by the story and kept asking questions wanting to know MORE about what was going on. She was intrigued, but bored.It's not a TERRIBLE book, it's just a dull book. If you like this art style I highly recommend TINKA or MY BEST SWEET POTATO, which have become steady favorites in our home, and others whom we have given them to."

5,I bought this for myself!,"I found this book in the library one day, and I was charmed by the illustrations and the sense of humor. I love to own children's books that really appeal to me, and I immediately ordered it. It gives me a lot of pleasure."
3,Simple Bedtime story,My child (age 3) was a bit bored with the story. It is fairly basic with very little action. The pictures are beautiful though. I think it would be best for a child under 2.
3,Was Okay...,"This product was amazing for the first couple of months but then the seems began to fall apart.... :( I love the wallet feature, but the product itself could be better made to last much longer than it did."
1,HUMMINGBIRD DOESN'T TAKE BEING ON THE WATER VERY SERIOUS WITH JUNK LIKE THIS,"I TRIED 2 PUCKS, ""THRU HAWL"" -- READINGS WERE NEVER STABLE ENOUGH TO KNOW IF YOU WERE IN 4 FEET OF WATER OR 11 FEET OF WATER... THESE PUCKS WERE INSTALLED JUST 1/8"" FIBERGLASS TO TRANSMIT THRU AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR INSTRUCTIONS... NEXTED I TRIED THE TRANSOM MOUNT RIGHT SMACK IN THE WATER, SITTING WITH NO ENGINE RUNNING AND 1/2 THE TIME IT SEEMED NORMAL BUT THEN IT WOULD START JUMPING AROUND..... THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR MADE ME FEEL I COULD NOT TRUST THE INDICATION I WAS SEEING.......... DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!! THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE THAT WORK BUT MAY COST A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS BUT THAT'S YOUR CHOICE..."
2,"Some needed options,,,,",This depth finder does not have an internal On-off switch so make sure you wire one into it. I also had problems with the readings going haywire after initial installation following the installation instructions to a tee. I had to deviate and mount the transducer much higher than they recommend to get a reading. The readings still goes haywire when on-plane though not much I can do about that.
3,Bible Classes,"This book is full of good information if you are taking a class in Acts, but it is a very boring read.The Book of Acts: Form, Style, and Theology (Fortress Classics in Biblical Studies)"
5,Beautiful solo ukulele,"These are beautiful and sparse tracks of the inimitable Ohta-San playing Hawaiian melodies, mostly solo on his ukulele. Wonderful taste, tone, phrasing, and musicality in each track, without any of the flashiness or goofiness of so many other uke virtuosos. If you love clean, simple, lovely, and tasteful Hawaiian ukulele music, look no further."
1,wrong answers for some questions,"Test practices are fine, but there should not be any mistakes in the book. Like #14 (pg 64)in 'math application test practice'answer is 9 a.m. not 10 a.m.#19 (pg 65) could have 3 correct answers.Vocabulary (pg 13) #4 That dress is an ""unusual"" color. Odd or peculiar could both be correct. My 10 year old chose correct and checked in his Webster dictionary. Unusual was defined as 'odd' not 'peculiar'.Too many errors for a test practice book, which has a lot of filler pages to begin with."
2,Unsatisfactory recording & performance,"The performance is unsatisfactory and not professional at all. You can easily here the unstable rhythm and not-well-tuned tones, especially for those piccolos and flutes.When I was listening to the CD, I also found that music is in a 2-D dimension only : simply like music from mono radio.Of course, if I take into account of the price, it might be unfair to expect too much, but I know that some CD of this price level can have much better surround sound and performance.I would not recommend this CD to those classical music audience."
3,not enough detail,"Good book for experienced mechanics, but for the average guy I don't think there is enough detail or wrench sizes etc."
4,Chilton still writes good manuals,"I started working on cars as a college student using Chilton's and Haynes manuals. As I got older, I brought the OEM shop manuals and I find that the Chilton's are much better illustrated and easier to use. Us weekend mechanics should just stick with these and save our money. I would rather have a book to flip through than going through a CD to find what I am looking for."
4,Pretty Awesome Garage Punk,"The title says it all. Not especially groundbreaking or anything, just damn good music"
1,Second Chance doesn't deserve a chance,"My husband and I watched this movie for the first time last night. Perhaps we were expecting more after having seen Courageous in the theater recently (that was a great film). ""The second chance"" didn't challenge us to be a better person, to live more like Christ. Swear words were said from the pulpit and other places in this movie by the one ""pastor"". The anger oozing from the pastor was a turn-off even though you know it is because of the lack of help in a very dark place and the constant 1 step forward, 2 steps back. We were left having witnessed not the love of Christ but hate and frustration towards others. This had the potential to be a great movie but it wasn't."
2,A LET DOWN...,"If you want to watch a movie that leaves you hanging at the end and comes to no real resolution--watch this movie! If not, pick another movie.Unlike most Christian films, this film appeared to have a decent budget, but decent budgets don't mean super movies. Some of the singing in the movie was nice, but besides that it was a giant disappointment.If you want to see a nice Christian film that doesn't leave you hanging, I suggest either ""Facing the Giants"" or ""Flywheel."""
3,"not the worst, and made some good points.","but it is still pretty safe and polished.it is all pretty for TV, per sey.but, they meant well, from a bunch of well-fed churched folks from tennessee.i would let my kids see it, but i would also stress that it isn't a ""real movie""."
5,The Second Chance Review - Great movie,What do you think about church? What do you think Christians should do with their time and money? How do we really help those in need? How do we really show God's love to others? This movie does a great job of getting back to the heart of living for Jesus instead of showing off for Jesus. It's a moving movie.
3,"I can't help it, I liked it.","Cons: the story has been done 100 times (think Stand by Me or Dangerous Minds at church), low budget, cheesy ending, and foot-washing scene.Pro: If you are a fan of Michael W. Smith, how can you resist the chance to see him act? And he actually doesn't do a bad job. The whole deal is a bit cheesy, but I like it because of the way the storyline criticizes the corporate-style megachurch and the wanna-be CEO model of leadership, and emphasizes real ministry to real people.All and all, worth watching."
2,Very disappointing,"Disappointed with the inner city pastor's language and un-Christlike example. He had no sense of humor throughout the movie. While there were some realistic elements in the movie, the power of the Spirit seemed to be lacking. After seeing what some Christian movies can do to lift one's spirit, this movie fell far short."
4,The Second Chance,I thought this movie was very well done. It was a good role for Michael W. Smiths first acting job. I think it shows that we need to look at ourselves internally before we can look and judge those around us.
3,good until the end,"I bought this movie to watch at camp and ended up watching with my mom. Both she and I were stunned at the lack of finality in the ending. It was almost as though they ran out of money, so just stopped the movie, two scenes from the end, I was very disapointed."
4,good story,"A telling tale of how today's values can often conflict with what's really important. As the the story unfolds, Christ's effect on His people begins to change this church, and the community. I enjoyed watching it twice!"
2,Stereotype,"I am a big Michael W Smith fan, but was very disappointed with this movie. The wealthy mega-church is filled with only white people while the church in the 'projects' is made up of mostly black people who are former druggies and prostitutes. I thought this film was attempting to oppose racial bias? So there are no minorities in the mega-churches? Only blacks struggle with addictions and illicit lifestyles?Sorry, but I did not get the point of this movie. Supposedly this movie was to portray the church as Steve Taylor envisions it. I sure hope there aren't many Pastors like the ones portrayed in either 'The Rock' or the Second Chance church."
1,Only Michael W. Smith fans will like this,"It's movie that shoves its religious beliefs of Christianity down your throat and it screams I'm better than you because I'm a Christian, you're not.Sorry, you blind sided sheep like Michael W. Smith fans, the man cannot act! You may think he's fantastic but you fans are so in awe, you couldn't see his lousy acting skills. However, he's an okay singer. He only did this movie to be more prosperous in his luxuriant lifestyle than he already is.The other actor in the movie jeff obafemi carr was a pretty decent actor. He tried his best in this horrible weak movie."
3,The Second Chance,"This movie was watchable, but I was hoping for a little more than it gave. There was a lot of potential but I believe some the points it was trying to make were a little vague. I was a little disappointed."
4,The Second Chance film DVD,"Movies about churches are usually not exciting. They bore everybody but the overly overtly pious. Even a classic like A Man Called Peter about Rev. Marshall, the most important Congressional Chaplain ever has been pretty much forgotten. But Second Chance is a wonderful exception, an exciting, tense but warm, eventful and even suspenseful story about many of the public and personal issues and situations that enliven our society: race relations, the inner city vs. the suburbs, varieties of growth and communication, old and new styles of managing a church and of seeking the moral life, all involving two interesting and complicated preachers. The film deserves a A+A+A+A+ rating, limited only because some silly agnostics might not enjoy the church themes. But everybody should like the acting and writing and the treatment of personal and social issues. And I am very happy with the seller."
1,NOT a Christian movie,"It doesn't matter what ''side of the tracks'' you are from, if you belong to Christ, you are supposed to love each other. They were just mad and fighting the whole time! Where was the gospel of JESUS CHRIST in this movie? Where is the message of repentance and salvation? The ""pastor"" in the movie doesn't even know how to repent (and clearly doesn't have the desire to)!! This WHOLE movie is about taking revenge when things don't go your way. And the pastor was the main one doing it! He acted more evil than the drug dealer did!! He treated his ''brother-in-Christ'' like dirt throughout the whole movie. The Bible says that anyone who doesn't love his brother is not of God (1John 3:10, 4:20).This is not a Christian movie. Don't be fooled by the church building."
1,beware pastor cusses,I didn't finish watching this video. During about the first 15-30 minutes I heard at least three cuss words. One of the pastors even cussed out the congregation! Not what I expect from a christian type movie. There are other very good christian movies that do not use bad language to get their point across.
3,The Second Chance,"It was a good movie; although, being a inner city minister- I didn't agree with the direction of the movie."
4,the second chance,I only gave it a four instead of a five because thae cusing that did not fit this type of movie.
3,Good show. Okay message.,"I like Michael W. Smith and his music. Always wanted to see the show. Wasn't super impressed. Kind of bored me, but it was a good show and had an okay message. It was nice to see a stereotypical nice guy play a role in which he needed to learn a thing or two about loving people. Michael W. Smith can act, though! Movie was very believable!I liked Steven Curtis Chapman in his Christmas show betterChristmas Child"
4,"Excellent movie, well done",This movie was a bit rough out of the gate but got much better as the story developed. I really thought by the end of the movie that it was well worth it. Thumbs up!
3,Feelgood movie,"Its a feelgood movie, but there are no big surprises. Its a good story, but it could have been done more clever. I almost cried once, but I believe the film could have been even more moving if they had made some small changes. All in all a good movie, and it has something to teach us all"
1,Don't waste your money,"I have tried 3 different lanterns. First would not even charge up and light up. Second charged overnight and last less than 10 minutes on time. Third was better, it lasted 15 minutes with an overnight charge. Useless piece of junk."
4,"Rare book, the orginal Practical Dharma",I appreciate the seller providing me the opportunity to research an early version of the Practical Dharma. I have a web site and a book in progress with that name currently.The book arrived in a timely fashion and was in the condition advertised.
2,Not what I anticipated,"This is supposed to be a great classic film, but pictures are in such poor quality it is very difficult to pay attention to this movie."
4,ORNERY LITTLE CRITTERS,"Ah, those memories of the eighties when movies like this were fun and not too gory. CRITTERS is a funny, tongue in cheek look at a bunch of furry critters who come to earth to eat people. My favorite scene is when one of the little devils comes upon a stuffed E.T., asks him who he is and then promptly devours him. Ironic that Dee Wallace Stone who plays the mother in this movie was also in E.T. The movie has lots of laughs, and a few chills along the way. M. Emmet Walsh is the sheriff; Don Opper is the bumbling Charlie; and young Scott Grimes is the boy hero. Catch Titanic and Phantom's Billy Zane in one of his early roles.Maybe not as much fun as GREMLINS, but still a classic of its kind."
3,a decent little sci-fi flick for it's time,"Ah, Critters. I saw this movie along with it's other sequels a number of years ago and liked them for the most part. This and Critters 2 came on back to back on HBO recently and of course I wanted to see them again. Well on to the review of Critters. Let me start off by saying that this movie is geared more toward teenagers and adults may rate this as a typical ""B movie"". I won't ruin the plot for anyone who hasn't seen Critters so I'll just say that if you like a dark sci-fi with a bit of humor than you may want to check this out."
3,aliens who look like bowling balls,"no,this movie is not scary,nor,is it funney.But it is sure entertaining!This is a great example of a cult classic.It has all the right elements.I liked every part of this movie except Dee Wallce Stone.All she does in this movie is scream her head off!! I also thought the bounty hunter idea was quite stupid but heck with it,it's fun!Enjoy yourself!You might even see this movie on Tv.I just recently saw it on the superstation during Halloween time"
2,Cute!,"I'm sorry but I can't look at a film that displays people being chased by tumble weeds and call it scary. These little guys are way to small to call this a horror film. It was more funny then scary. I was astonished when I found out that they made two more, hehe. Sacrilege!"
1,Wait for the 4 pack,"The first and the second are fun, the last two kind of went off course. These days paying $16.99+ for these type of movies is unacceptable. Unless its offered in a 4 pack, I wouldnt waste my money on ANY of these movies, unless they drop the price to $9.99 each. In that case, buy the first two.NO SPECIAL FEATURES. Wait for the 4 pack."
3,Another 3 star review from Horrorflicker ...,"First of all, let me get this straight - THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM. However, I like comedys too, and this is quite a good sci-fi comedy.There are a few extremely funny lines in it, but mainly it's what you see that amuses you.So if you see this film selling cheap (like I did), go buy it. You'll lagugh ..."
3,Furballs from space with a major appetite,"I remember watching this movie years ago when I was only like around 12 or 13 years old. At the time it was a little creepy movie with those man eating hairballs from outer space but at the same time I found them to be comical at some points throughout the movie. Though I think that this movie is not so much horror though mostly Sci Fi with some comedy well put into the movie and the Critters (aka Crites), would probably freak out some people but not everyone. While the story may seem a little cheesy now but I guess it's just one of those movies that may have inbetween aged well and not aged well. Overall I give Critters 3.5 stars out of 5."
3,Fun movie,"I remember renting this movie with a friend when I was around ten years old, and it was a lot of fun and scary as hell. Unlike some of the other horror movies that featured monsters or aliens as the nemesis, the concept of Critters was pretty original, and although it's not award material, it's a pretty decent sci-fi/horror film.Don't go into this thinking that it's another ""Leprechaun"" or ""Jack Frost"" type of film. The film isn't about gore and despite the absurdity at how the Critters look on the cover, they are pretty scary in the film."
4,"first GREMLINS, then GHOULIES, now CRITTERS.","I am not a big fan or any thing of this movie, but i have to say it is one of the best PG-13 rated films i have seen. It is about these litte fur-ball alien things that eat anything, many humans (don't ask why). From the makers of ANDROID and BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE. The sequels are not that good.Rated PG-13 for Sci-fi/Horror Violence."
3,Not As Good As I Remember,"This movie was a lot better to me when I was kid growing up in the 80s but as an adult, I didn't find it as entertaining. In all honesty, I thought the plot was all over the place and there were too many loopholes as far as where the critters came from, why they escaped and why the bounty hunters would morph into anyone that they looked at too long. Oh well, this was the 80s and not every movie was well-developed but this movie still offered decent entertainment, I think I've just outgrown it."
1,Woods 723 16 gauge 50foot extension cord,Cord does not have a ground - plugs only have 2 prongs. I guess you can see it the product picture if you look careful enough. For me without the ground it is of little use - most products that I would want to use a 50 foot extension cord for have a ground (3 terminals).
1,terrible plastic??? sticky material rips?,my target is in pieces within 3 weeks or so. the plastic gets chipped every time u hit it. in the back its all broken. things terrible. some pellets actually went THROUGH the target. im using .20 mg bullets with the navy seal gun. i mean whats up with that?
3,Deja vu all over again....,"First off, I am an avid fan of the whole Titanic story, and went to the Titanic Artifacts exhibit to see items brought up from the ship. But this book is very disappointing, especially if you have Ballard's book 'The Discovery of the Titanic' (1987) because this book repeats so much of what was in that book. So for those who do not have that book, this book will make a fine addition. I was hoping for so much more in the way of new pictures but really was not safisfied with what was offered. I feel the book was put together quickly to make the case for preserving the site and the ship and with so much filler from old material was not a good value. A book simply focusing on the threats and the current state would have been better. However, for those new to the whole saga, this book will suffice."
3,Sunset Microwave Cookbook,Microwave Cook Book (Sunset Cook Books)I ordered this book to replace a book I had lost. Unfortunately it was a different edition but still serves my purpose.
3,"If you are buying 1 book, seek elsewhere","This book was bought as special offer by Amazon along with A Reference Grammar of Modern Hebrew by Coffin and Bolozky. This book came second.I could not quite work out why the book was divided into a more basic level 1 and a more advanced level 2 when as it says in the preface it ""is not a graded step-by-step course book"".I think the information is in there when I can find it and providing a different presentation of explanations than Coffin and Bolozky does mean that it can supplement that book. The problem I had was to locate the information I wanted.However the book is not without merit and there are exercises which do aid good learning. It is not the worst book, but neither is it the best"
4,Useful but limited in scope,"I recently put this book to the test. I used it as a reference while attending ulpan in Israel. It was very useful up to a point.The major grammatical categories are all covered in the book. It even covers some of the more advanced concepts like the subjunctive mood or expressing ""I used to..."" type things. I like the presentation of the ""maverick verbs"". Construction of the binyanim could have been more clearly presented. It is all there, just not organized in the best way.The only thing is that the book should have gone into a lot more detail on the use of prepositions. I ended up have several questions that I could not find the answer to. E.g. What is the distinction between l- and 'el when indicating the direction of action? When is b- used instrumentally vs. the direct object marker? Why is etzel+pronominal suffix used as a locative noun?The book is a good value, with a lot of information at a reasonable price."
2,Not Very Helpful,"Despite the other reviews presented here, *I* found the book a little pretentious. Many of the more complex grammatical concepts are just glossed over, or illustrated with non-standard examples. In addition, I found the fact that this author is British to be problemmatic. His background and academic experience tended to make the book come off as pedantic to American readers. References to parts of speech and grammatical elements are often inconsistent and unnecessarily complex. And finally, I found the fact that I had to write for the answers to the self-help exercises inexcusable. What good is a self-paced grammar text without the answers."
1,Ruins a 2pac classic,"A bit weak of Jay-Z to just cover a 2pac song, the original sounds much better, ashame most people don't know the original version..."
1,garbage pot,"It arrived as a wedding gift for my daughter and was broken well not realy broken , it was an enameled fondue pot without enamel.... lousy product"
4,A goodd starter cage...some inconveniences,"I bought this cage when I got my chinchilla. It's a pretty good sized cage, he's full grown and has plenty of room. The issues I've found are that the plastic ledges get chewed on pretty badly...especially if Tito is in one of his rambunctious moods. I replaced the water bottle because I felt that it didn't work very well and Tito seemed to get frustrated with it. I took out the plastic ramps because it was just another thing to chew on and chinchillas are hoppers so he didn't need them anyway. I also added another leap-n-ledge to give him more hang out places."
3,"High quality contents, low quality wiring, low quality ladders","Two of the wires are broken,the hooks on the sides to hold it in a rectangle while building it don't hold the clips properly, and both of the shelves' clasps were disconnected after about a month of chewing done by my Chinchilla. Overall, high quality for a chinchilla, but low quality in structural integrity."
2,"Intersting, but radically sound engineered","It's an interesting concept, but all the voices sound like they have been sanitised and tweaked by sound engineers, giving a false quality."
3,Good for a few playbacks,"It definitely is a little odd to listen to this CD. For the first few playbacks, I found it intriguing to hear the familiar songs in an unfamiliar format. But after a while, I went back to the original versions. I'd not buy the CD, but definitely would borrow it for a few days. Bottom line: Not something you'd want to hear over and over."
1,I've died and gone to hell and this albumn took me there,"Wow, this albumn now lives amoung the worst music ever. I'm glad I only listened to it and didn't buy it. Why not just play depeche mode with lots of reverb instead. A karaoke machine would sound better. Backstreet boys with harps, it's not God with the sick sense of humour."
5,Wonderful sound,"A pleasant surprise,and its turned out to be one of my favorite CD's-I love the gregorain chant and bringing it to modern tunes is just lovely-I'll be buying all their CD's!"
5,ENIGMATIC,"It's a great mixture of ""classical"" chanting of monks and modern electronic music that brings a real pleasure of meditational compositions that sometimes are called ""new age"", sometimes ""pure moods"". If you know Enigma's song ""Sadness"" from the first album with that type of monks' chanting - that's what Gregorian music sounds like. I also think their versions of a few famous songs are great as they bring a new, fresh interpretation."
1,Why they'd make this album? Why'd you want to buy it?,"This CD landed on my desk as a promo copy from the record label, and though I was initially curious and kept an open mind, I must say that it turned out to be absolutely horrible. The mix of popular music with the age-old genre might pique the curiosity of many listeners, but the reality is below disappointment. The 12 vocalists aren't very good, and their renditions are so lackluster, the entire effort only gains note as a novelty...."
3,Very enjoyable.,"I bought this album sound unheard.The cover drew my eye,and I haven't regretted my impulse.Some of the songs don't work that well with chanting,however if you love Enigma,you'll enjoy this,in small doses."
5,eek!,"to be completely honest, i have this because my boyfriend and i are suckers for shriekingly bad covers...and this album's chockablock. the only place this album works on a conceptual level is visage's ""fade to grey"" and ultreavox's ""vienna."" that's only because those particular tracks existed in a similarly-contrived conceptual setting anyway (deeply misunderstood and misappropriated neoclassicism). the other tracks are simply ridiculous. but then again, so is mae west's ""way out west"" from the sixties (which also includes a cover of percy sledge's ""when a man loves a woman,"" albeit only slightly more digestable.) it doesn't stop me from loving those. if you're a pop culture maniac with a masochistic streak, this album's an essential for your collection."
5,Gregorian! The best of it's kind ever!,I think Gregorian is the greatest! I really love this I also love Enigma. Tears in heaven is my personal favourite and I have to listen to it every day. Keep up th good work!
3,Not what I ordered,"I would have loved to have written a review for the sprinkler I purchased but unfortunately I didn't receive that one. I got one that I assume Amazon wanted me to have and I thought I would give it a try since I needed it really badly. We are so dry here and Texas.I received one by the name of BEST. I guess its cast iron, don't really know. Its heavy. I've used it several times and it was the same price as the Nelson. Only thing now is that I see it is rusting.The moral of this review? Don't accept anything except what you order. Even if you do need it."
5,Very Happy,"I am very happy with this product. It serves my need perfectly and works just like they said it would. I probably buy another one. I also received the product in a timely manner.LR Nelson Pound Of Rain 30-Foot Circular Spray Sprinkler, Cast Iron #2151"
3,Best for small lawns,"First of all, please note that this item is identical to the yellow Nelson stationary sprinkler except that this one is painted green and has a ""Do It Best"" sticker on it. So there really isn't any reason to pay the slightly higher price for this one unless you just absolutely love green over yellow. What I like about this sprinkler is that it has a simple heavy-duty design with no moving parts that can fail. Many impulse and oscillating sprinklers have to be replaced every year or two due to cheap lightweight parts that wear out. This cast iron sprinkler will probably last forever. What I don't like is that it doesn't come anywhere close to covering the promised 30-foot diameter range. To my eye, it doesn't even cover 20 feet. And we don't have unusually low water pressure. So for my lawn, I end up having to spend far too much time moving it around to cover every area. If you have a really small lawn, you'd probably find this an excellent sprinkler."
5,Easy to Love,"Another of the classic series of lesbian literature, the Lex and Amanda series by Carrie Carr should be on every collector's bookshelf. I recently read and enjoyed - for the second time - the entire story. In this fourth of the series (following `Hope's Path'), Amanda's mother returns and makes it her mission to get Amanda away from Lex. She will stop at nothing to reach her goal.Because of this wonderful series, Carrie Carr is one of the more widely-published authors in the genre. Lex and Amanda are easy to love and it's a joy to watch their relationship grow as the series develops."
3,"three and a half stars, really","just got this. a mellow, melancholy record. very beautiful. its really good. comparisons to neil young are unavoidable, so there it is. in fact, the first song is really similar to ""heart of gold"" on any number of levels. youll like this if you like any of the palace stuff, neil young, centromatic, my morning jacket, early beck, etc. really good. id love to hear more from this guy."
3,Takes some getting used to,"When I bought this CD, I did not realize that it was entirely acoustic. However, it has grown on me a lot. ""Rest of My Life"" is awesome, but a lot of people have heard that by now. ""Seeing Red"" acoustic is a different experience and I find that ""Rescue Me"" is actually better than the original recording. However, ""Up All Night"" is absolutely painful to listen to. By far, the best song on the album is ""Shallow."" Buy the CD, if for no other reason than it was recorded almost entirely in Yellowstone and northwestern Wyoming."
4,"Isn't music in high places supposed to be like, folky stuff?","So, though I wasn't a fan of ""Elva"" I did think the acoustic versions showcased here held water a bit better. It's always good to see a poppunk band go acoustic, it needs to happen more often. the only real downside to this disc is that its practically all stuff from elva. I could have handled a few more tracks from self titled and or blue room"
3,"Not bad, note, some ""bleeping"" in Casablanca Express.","This collection isn't bad, but I was surprised to find three ""bleeps"" in the second movie, Casablanca Express. If these manufacturers are going to release movies, they should let people know that they're gonna bleep, or edit, them. I'm surprised the brief nudity at the beginning (which most get edited for) got by. It's not about seeing or hearing something, but how they treat the viewer. If I wanted to see a ""censored"" version, I'd see it (if they'd show it) on broadcast tv. It's like with a cheapo version I had (which was a waste of money) of Terminal Island that bleeped and edited out material. There should be two versions of dvds, one with edits and one without, that way people can choose. I know the third movie Submarine Alert will be ok, because it was made so far back that there's nothing they can edit. Enough said."
4,The Best of the all of the Sets,"I liked all of the movies on here. Definetly worth $5. Now since amazon didnt give the ratings i will.Submarine Alert-1943-(5.9/10)-Starring: Richard Arlen and Wendy Barrie. An F.B.I agent infiltrates a gang of Axis Spies planning to attack West Coast shipping. <My Take>A good suspense movie...Worth watchingEscape From Sobibor-1987-(7.5/10)-Starring: Alan Arkin and Rutger Hauer. The true story of The Largest Prison from a Death Camp in WW2. <My Take> Awesome it is a great movie and nearly comparable to ""THE GREAT ESCAPE""Casablanca Express-1989-(3.9/10)-Starring: Glenn Ford and Donald Pleasence. Nazi Commandos hijack the train carrying Winston Churchill. <My Take> Despite its low 4 star rating it is actually a good movie and a pretty good action movieFinal Note: If you find it under $5 like i did...Buy It"
5,Awesome,"I've always wanted a nice quality staff like this, very hard dense wood and a nice coating on it. a beautiful staff really i can't wait to learn jojutsu. Mine got here right away."
4,Nice Jo,"Bought this Jo as a present for a friend getting his black belt and he loves it. A bit heavier than my Jo, but at 1/4 the price it's a good deal."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped it would be,"I love Kevin Smith's movies, I mean I even listened to his podcast. But this turned out to be less than spectacular, The animation was sub standard and wasn't as fun to watch as I thought it would be."
2,My first Tamrac disappointment,"I purchased this bag to have a convenient way to take my tripod and head on the road, including on commercial flights. I have several other Tamrac bags and have always been impressed with their quality. When the 324 arrived, I was amazed at how flimsy it was. The fabric is thin and seems weak - very un-Tamrac. I returned it and purchased the Hakuba PSTC100 bag - same size, same price, but far superior in quality. Heavier fabric, better padding, sturdy zipper, larger exterior pocket; a better bag in every respect."
4,O.K.,Excellent source of information but it definitly should have been reproduced in a letter formatt.The printing is small and sometimes blurry.You will definitly need a magnifying glass
4,Keeping the train running,This has alot of info on Lionel trains. I had no info for the train I've had since the 50's. This is proving helpful in teaching my grandson about my train and allowing me to do some repairs on it.
5,"Greenbergs Repair and Operating Manual,Lionel trains 45-69","Very informative manual,very useful in repair and maintenance."
1,Small size plus small print & fuzzy diagrams,"I have many of the original Lionel service notes included in this book. The original service notes were printed on 8.5 by 11 inch paper; these originals lack the clarity which is standard for today's printing technology. Take the ""not so crisp"" originals, reduce them in size to 6.03 inches by 8.42 inches (this is the size of the book) and it becomes a chore to read the book without a magnifying glass, and even then some of the numbers (identifying the parts) can't be read. The sad thing is the author has done a good job in correcting and updating the material, but the publisher went the cheap, cheap, cheap route. If you must buy, be sure to include a magnifying glass!"
2,Poorly printed book.,Content of the book seems to be scanned owner operating instructions and service manual pages. Much of the text was either so small in font size or such poor quality of print that it was necessary to scan and enlarge pages of interest.I was very tempted to return the book. In the future I will not be purchasing books from this publisher.
5,Just what I wanted,I have some old Lionel trains I wanted to repair and didn't know how to find the right parts to order. Greenberg's Repair manual is just what I needed. Anyone who wants to repair a vintage Lionel train should have it.
4,What a find!,"This book was a hard-to-find book in the bricks and mortar stores, but Amazon came through, again. What a resource! Only improvement would be to be a larger-sized book with less pages . . . but since it is the info that counts, it really isn't that important."
3,disorganized,"The Rebel's Dilemma I think tries to make an interesting modification to collective action theory. However, the book comes across as a collection of long lists of ideas and concepts related to insurgencies with not enough clear explanation. Lichbach lists strategies insurgents can adopt, but it's occasionally unclear where or how they fit into the larger scheme of collective action theory. Also, Lichbach has a really annoying habit of using acronyms for various concepts, such as ""CA"" for collective action, which gets a bit confusing while reading. Overall, this sort of broad theorizing would have been better presented as a short, crisp article."
4,Zombie 90,"Low budget gore fest by German director Andreas Schnaas. After you get pastthe horrible english dubbing the movie is fun to watch. You really have to be fan of the genre the enjoy this movie. Gore hound will not be let down, some great splatter and chainsaw action. Recomended highly to gore and b movie fans."
5,Give me MOORE!,"As a Moore & Moore fan for many years, I have been anxiously awaiting the follow up to their last album, ""Master of My Own Destiny"". ""Million Roses"" has been well worth the wait. Packed with 16 songs,this collection showcases the tight sibling harmonies that I love along with top-notch songwriting from Debbie & Carrie. Along with the title cut, other standouts include ""Wings"", ""Ring Around Rosie's Finger"", ""Almost Doesn't Count"", ""His Song"", ""I Just Know"" and Moore & Moore's cover of the Mark Wills hit, written by Debbie Moore, ""Wish You Were Here"". This album showcases the talented singing and songwriting of one of the best duos in country music! I am listening to the album as I write this and find that I love ALL these songs. Right now ""I Don't Have The Heart"" is playing... this album rocks!"
3,everything that happens is dynamic,"Our axiosphere is a gambling addiction. Our primary innovation is hyperbolic cyberpower. The Quantum Nietzsche tries to give Nietzsche credit for seeing the high stakes we have on flipping the bobsled over whenever our thermonuclear weapons could wipe out life on earth instead of allowing us to continue living in indignation, but it chickens out. Buck buck Bacaw!"
2,It doesn't work for me,"I have lots of blemishes on my skin, so I was hoping that this would work for me. However, it caused allergic reactions after just one application. Now my skin feels rough with many red breakouts and is quite irritated. Following the product manual, I stopped immediately and am planning to return it.I am not saying that it doesn't work at all, but it doesn't work for me. Maybe I will just have to live with my blemishes, :-(."
3,A little disappointing.,"The paper is nice, however, not as thick as I was hoping for, for newsletter use."
4,"Great pack, not the best for my needs","I recently ordered 5 packs that seemed right up my alley... carrying a laptop, its power chord, a change of clothes and other essentials on long flights, while small (and thin) enough to fit under the seat in front of me. I put this one in second place, so I had to return it. But it's a great pack and was only edged out by the High Sierra Swerve's excellent use of compartments high up in the pack (which more evenly distributes the items you're carrying, allowing the pack to maintain a thinner overall profile, as all your stuff doesn't wind up in the bottom).I love the retractable pull-up document sleeve and the extra waist-level pocket on the backside of the pack, and there are plenty of organizational features for small items. It stays fairly thin when fully loaded, at 8 inches max. That's important when you have to slip the pack under the seat. If it had more upper compartments and a top-access pocket like the High Sierra, it would have been my top pick."
5,"Best artist, awesome album","This is the best Latin composer ever!!!, don't even doubt to get this album, you won't regret"
5,Arizona Gardener's Guide,"This book is the best gardening book that I have found for Tucson, AZ. The author divides the information into sections, such as Annuals, Perennials, Shrubs, Trees, etc. For each plant there is a picture on the page with care, growing tips, where and how to plant it, mature size, blooming period, and other interesting tips for the particular plant. This book has saved me alot of money by not investing in something that will not grow well here in Tucson. So far, everything I have planted using Mary Irish's advice this spring is still growing and blooming, even in our 100+ degree heat!"
2,arizona gardener's guide,"For me, disappointing.I was really hoping for a more comprehensive guide towards natives and desert plants. I don't need to be told on every page that I need to dig a large hole to plant a plant!"
3,Medieval mystery,"The film is about a pagan ceremony that David Niven is the center of, the pacing is deliberate but good, this is the screen debut of both the late, Sharon Tate and David Hemmings andis interesting for that fact. Similar to the Wicker Man in theme, a rarely seen 60's film"
5,Please release on DVD!,Her breakthrough role that was very pivotal to the film. In black and white Sharon's true beauty is revealed. She looks incredible. They really need to release this on DVD.
4,Don't expect music,"This CD does not contain music, but ambient noise. This is the sort of thing you can play to create a certain mood or to relax. It's somewhere between music and white noise in how structured it is. Fascinating project, well worth checking out."
3,One Song is Really Good,"After my first listen, I can tell you ""Way it Goes"" is a remarkable song.The rest of the songs are unobtrusive. ""Way it goes"" (which is very similar in style to the Wallflowers ""Closer to You"") is great to listen to while writing poetry. The electronic muffled beat adds a sort of ""trapped emotions within the syncopated rhythm of the heartbeat's unforgivingly ordinary tempo of life"" sort of a feel. Although I like this song very much, it sort of doesn't go anywhere but it's still a 4-5 star song."
2,Disheartened...................at best,"I am an old school creeper fan and just have to express how disappointed I am in the the former lineup disbandment (the loss of Ian Sefchick, actually) These guys were the sweetest ish since Sunny Day Real Estate/Run DMC/Beastie Boys.....you get my point) I swore up and down these guys were headed for massive success....not because they necessarily had a perfect pop formula (some would argue they did, including myself) but because their music was genuine and held an amazing balance, which I think no band has done since, of indie rock sensibility, pure melodic/pop bliss, and urban/hip hop influence (specifically ""I become small and go album"") All members continue to be great musicians, but the magic that Ian and Sharky created will be missed dearly.Joey"
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME,Thank you for helping me find this album on cd. I've been looking for this for about fourteen years. I wore out 2 albums and 4 cassettes of this album.I've been a fan of Johnny for 20 years and this is one of the best albums of all time. Thank's again.
5,Johnny Van Zant's Best Work,Front to back this is a great album. Not a bad song in the bunch. A must have for fans of 80's rock.
5,Another satisfied customer!,Once again I was able to find a product that was not available locally and was well pleased with my purchase. Thank you!
1,80's Crap,The worst decade of music is most certainly the 1980's and this CD doesn't disappoint in the realm of bad 80's music. It's pure 80's and pure bad.
3,More for moms who married,This is a good book but it's not so much for the single mom who did not marry the child's father
5,The Dummies 365 Ways to Cook Hamburger,"I am frustratingly writing a review that hardly anyone will ever likely read. Such is life. Nonetheless, this wonderful cook book originally published fifty years ago deserves much praise. The author Doyne Nickerson put together a collection of hamburger recipes that can be prepared by those possessing limited cooking skills. He learned to prepare hamburger during the Depression Era. It was just about the only meat he could afford. Necessity, alas, is often the primary motivator in the creation of countless delicious recipes. If it were possible, I would also rename the book, ""The Dummies 365 Ways to Cook Hamburger."" You should definitely purchase a copy as soon as possible."
1,Tale Learn How to Think About Money,"This is really a handbook for how to be a good Christian and get rich. If that's what you're looking for, here's your book.I don't recommend."
2,Nothing Much New & Idiotic Cover Art,"Unfortunately Columbia is just regurgitating the same material into new releases. Nothing much new here that isn't already available. On another note, the person who came up with this cover art knows nothing about Gene apparently. Gene played Slingerland drums virtually his entire career. The cd shows him sitting behind a modern Yamaha set with an 18"" bass drum! Gene never played anything smaller than a 22."""
3,Re-issue not as good.,"I was hoping for a booklet with the disc as I'm used to the original. This had nothing, it's like a soulless computer put the thing together to make a buck."
1,Making Fools Out Of Themselves,"First notice its all PUNK bands....they are stupid...why? First, they think their music is good, second because they think they can influence people to vote for Kerry, who has lied and well......is a fabricator.Sadly, they do influence people, the gullable people who beleive everything they hear and see.Did I mention, this music sucks?"
5,Great CD with a message,It came out today and I picked up my copy when the local borders opened at 9 am. If you liked the first one you will REALLY like the 2nd one. I think this one is better than the first. lots of prominent punk bands and mainstreamers as well. Can't go wrong with the Foo Fighters! Peace out.....and Dubya out!!hope you all like it as much as me.
4,It's almost as good as Vol. 1,"Cool bands overall i was looking forward to a new Green Day song and the Foo Fighter's cover of ""Gas Chamber"" which is an awesome song.Other notable traks are from Dropkick Murphy's ,Lawrence Arms,Dillinger Four, Jawbreaker (I'm a huge fan),Dwarves,No use for a name. I must be getting old cause i didn't totally hate the Yellowcard song, but i still think No Doubt sucks so maybe it evens out."
3,Boatloads of money?,"This album is hit and miss. There are a number of good songs by great artists. I am especially happy with the Hot Water Music song. However, I write this review mainly to take issue with the previous reviewer. Many of these bands do not make ""a boatload of money"". These bands have placed songs on this album, presumably, without financial compensation. They have done this to promote an issue they believe to be important. If nothing else, you should buy this album as gratitude for bands that are more concerned with standing up for what they believe in than making ""a boatload of money""."
3,But how's the music?,"Well, kind of meh, actually. If you like the bands, then it's worth getting.Just thought I'd mention the actual music, though... since none of these other reviews seem to."
2,Lot to be desired,"I picked up ""Rock Against Bush - Vol. I"" and was really impressed by the quality of the music, the price, and the message. NOT SO in this case! More 'mainstream' artists (like No Doubt, and Dropkick Murphy's) but the quality is just not there. Many songs sound like demo tester recordings that they just handed to Fat Mike to put this CD together. But of course, many of these bands wouldn't just write/record something just for this comp! So in that aspect I'm not surprised. It's just a shame that it shares a name with the 1st edition of this compilation which is far more superior and coherent."
2,"Bad Title, Good Music","Although I do not agree with the message this CD is trying to get across, I will say the music is great. I think Rock Stars/Celebrities should quit pushing their views on easily persuaded 16 year olds who think of Rock stars as idols. It seems people in this world don't make up their own mind anymore, instead they are manipulated by the ""Loud-Mouth Minority."" Get your facts straight, but in the meantime, enjoy the great music. 2 stars for good music, missing 3 stars for the stupid message they are pushing forward."
2,yellowcard and sugarcult make me want to be hitler,"if bands like yellowcard,good charlotte, and sugarcult are ""rocking against bush"" consider me a nazi. anyways dillinger four is on this which rocks, op ivy is on this or the other one which is also a plus, a few good bands earn it 2 stars... green day inc...lets not go there. get operation ivys cd instead of this dirty neo-hippy inspired jargon."
2,"2 stars for music, none for shameless marketing ploy","Ok people, do you honestly think that this cd is going to make any difference in the 2004 election? Sure, the songs have direct or veiled political messages, but what do they have to complain about, and how can they pretend to represent working class America as they sit in their mansions and eat their caviar while this shameless ploy to play off of people's hatred of Bush makes more millions for the bank. Don't tell me they aren't getting at least a piece of the money, even if they don't make any off of this direct cd, their own personal cd sales will be boosted b/c of it. I say they sell their mansions and give all the money of their cd sales to whatever cause they feel truly necessary. That would be truly punk, which is different, do-it-yourself, not sitting and whining about your problems. Oh and by the way, the music is ok, although some crappy pop made it on here (yellowcard, that means you)."
1,Is there not a vote for 0 stars?,"This has got to be the sorriest excuse for a disc compliation in the history of music. Let's take some of the worst bands and gather their worst tracks and put them on one liberal minded CD and sell it against George W. Great Idea... I'm just glad it won't make anymore money than it will... like John Heinz... oops, Kerry needs it.VOTE W"
2,one song is worth it,"this record blows. but the Sleater-Kinney tune, 'Off With Their Heads' is worth the price of admission. It's a hard track to find...only issued on a limited edition. So this record is one of the few places to find it. And it's worth it."
4,bad religon all the way,"first let me say i woul give it 4 and a half starsfirst of all this cd is awsome. one reason i love it is im a democrat and i HATE BUSH. another reason i like it is theirs so many awsome artists like greenday, bad religon, operation ivy, No/Fx (on the dvd), andinternational noise conspiracy. another reason i luv it is it turned me on to new artist like floggy molly and the will ferrel skit on da dvd is hillarious. another reason u should buy it is if you dont know alot bout bush (unlike me) it teaches you how bad he is at bein president. the reason i took away half a star cuz it has some sucky aritst like sugarcul and yellowcard"
5,Free Speach.,"""Who gave them the right to express their traitorous opinions?"" I believe the answer to that question is the First Amendment. It is nice to see bands speaking out and exercising one of the rights that makes the country great. I would recomend it to any young person under 25. The stakes are to high to be apathetic. I really like what these bands have done here, which is encourage the youth of America to exercise the right to vote. There are to many people in the older generation that seek to keep the young people out of politics. One thing that I thought about when listening to this album was the simple fact that we are the ones who are going to run this country in 20 years, lets make it a place that we can all live in."
4,It's funny hearing people argue,"I did enjoy this CD, im not a Bush supporter so it looked interesting to me. I also enjoyed the bands on it to. So this is a good CD but can get continuous after awhile. As for people saying the bands get rich off of it..thats not really true, these cd's didnt sell that many copies and some of the bands on here arent as rich as most bands on major labels. They are also not shoving it down your throat, you have a choice to buy it or not, so if u dont want to listen you dont have to. If an artist wants to write about something that you dont like, thats your problem not theres, they do and write what theyd like. Also for punk not being talented, i've never really heard a punk band thats incredibly talented, i enjoy 3 or 4 chords over and over. So in conclusion, good but kind of continuous cd but still it was cheap for what it came with it was a good deal and good bands."
5,--,I laugh at those of you who don't like this cd because it has songs by liberal bands. Why did you even bother buying this if you are in support of Bush? The title should have given you a hint as to what kind of message it was sending out...
5,Great CD and DVD against a bad Bush.,"The lead singer of NOFX is called Fat Mike and he has a very well known independent punk music label called Fat Wreck Chords (Fat Records) and he wants (wanted) Bush out of office so they (the label and him) released two different punk compilations with a lot of well known punk and rock bands called Rock Against Bush Vol. One and Rock Against Bush Vol. Two, and they both came with many many reasons why he should not be in office and some great DVDs with music videos and political stuff too. You should pick them up if you ever see them here or anywhere. The cheap price for so many songs and a great DVD is very much worth it."
1,Politics aside. . .,"This album is not worth buying.These bands are thrown on a cd in an attempt to make money for a cause that most of them dont understand. Compilation cd's are only good when they are thought out and organzied. The tracks seem to jump around and have no cohesive nature.In addition to this i am very against the attempts by these musicians to influence young, and sadly gullable, voters.Personally i didnt vote and i dont frankly care who won, however i was sad to see one of my favorites, green day, stoop to this liberal propoganda."
1,unpatriotic rock against bush,"pop stars should entertain the populous instead of having us endure their misguided ravings about the gov't, most do not have all the info or facts to make a legitimate statement that is not driven by the notion that it is cool to criticize. Where were they when Clinton drove this country time after time into scandal, because he could not keep his equipment in his pants, but to his defense, looking at Hillary, I don't blame him."
3,"Nice chains, but...","I searched for short sterling silver chains for my daughters (ages 7 & 9) and was pleased to find these. They are sturdy, priced affordingly and just the right length, but the spring ring clasps on both chains (I bought two) are faulty. They open fine but don't close unless you push them closed, so I must assist my girls every time they wish to wear their necklaces. Too bad, because it was difficult to find chains appropriately sized for young girls."
3,Questionable clasp,I am disappointed in the clasp on this chain. The chain is lovely but the clasp doesn't close properly. I should have taken a review I read to heart. I ordered two but will definitely find better ones locally. Since it is a child's chain the clasp should be strong.
3,Review,"I thought this was going to be a little bigger, but it wasn't. I would still recommend this product. I think my nephew will be happy for Christmas."
3,"""A Little More 'Shui'""",Nice effort by John. Gets better with each play. Please see my review for the domestic version.
4,Sold me!,John's new album is definetly a peice of work. I'm enjoying it very much. This album contains quite simply the best version to electric ladyland to date. Jimi Hendrix would be floored..
3,Short but Sweet,"This album is very short but the songs are all good. I found it on K.I.T.H.'s website for $5, so at a buck a song I think it's a good buy. Just don't pay $13 for it, go too www.kickedinthehead.com."
5,Great first DVD player,"Not having owned a DVD player before, I had to do a little research, but found that for the money, it's a really great player. Menu options are very easy to understand, given I was so busy I didn't have the time to really RTFM and consequently learned by doing. (it was very intuitive) Also, the built in 5.1 surround sound decoder will come in very handy in the future, I'm sure. One thing that I had to figure out for myself tho was that my older TV wasn't entirely compatible with the player, as it had only a coaxial cable input in the back of it. But then I went to the radio shack website, and they had some info on how to hook up an RF Modulator. Which sounds high falootin, but it's not really. It was actually really fun. Anyways, the player itself is fabulous."
2,Has problems like Other Sony DVD Players,"This is a fine DVD player--when it's working. It's my second Sony DVD player and the second one to fail after less than 1 year of use. Just about every disk freezes regularly, making it essentially unusable. These same disks work fine in other players. Read the online reviews here for other Sony DVD players. You're going to have the same problems with this one."
3,"Great, but you pay for useless ""features""","I have used DVD players since the first month they came out, and unlike the VHS market where you have to decide whether you want 2, 4, or 6 heads, Hifi stereo, and flying erase heads, a DVD is a DVD. Yes, you can pay for ""Virtual 3D"" and ""DVE"" but do you want to? The Sony DVP-NS400D is a wonderful DVD player, and I have yet to find any serious faults with it. Scanning is smooth and the controls are easy to use, and the menus, while not as visually attractive as they could be, are easy to see and navigate. As with most DVD players these days, this model has DTS output... But personally, these ""features"" are more marketing gimicks than anything else. ...if the added capabilities of the NS400D really do appeal to you, or if you the Sony brand name means a lot to you, this is a fine piece of equipment."
4,Great value for the money,"Bought this for my son who is doing digital sound. Very large unit with lots of capability. Worked well but wish the USB connecting device was built on-board (into) the unit and not a separate piece. One of the LEDs stopped working, but this didn't effect the sound quality or use."
1,Olsen is Correct. The History Doesn't Come Through,"The prose style of this book gets in it's way. Unfortunately Eric Olsen is correct. Though Sicily has a fascinating history, dramatic and exciting, it certainly does not come through in this poorly translated book. It's the fault of the translator that it fails. Justin Vitiello's command of English is not what it might be were he less pretentious in his choice of language and syntax. One imagines it reads better in the Italian of Quatriglio who should find himself a better translator. There is merit in the information, were it better presented."
5,Totally Killer!,"Ever since I heard Wes's fantastic ""12 Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking,"" I've been waiting for his follow-up cd. ""Pollyanna"" delivers. Its completely amazing, and while it is a little more laid back than his last album, it still surprises me. Wes Cunningham always seems to differentiate his songs stylistically, and that is one of my favorite things about him. He has awesome harmonies and chord arrangements. Its innovative and yet classic at the same time. I HIGHLY recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good tunes. Buy it!"
5,A Revelation,"Wes's music almost defies description. Certainly it comes with a strong pop sensibility. The album is peppered with musical statements that are throwbacks to bubble gum pop from the late sixties and seventies--think Bee Gees or ELO.. But there is an alternative side that utilizes acoustic guitar and electronic effects that would make Beck proud. I am sorry I cannot be clearer I am not a Rolling Stone critic with an exhaustive supply of arcane musical comparisons on hand. What really sets Wes apart though is his lyrics and his voice. His music, for lack of a better description, is sweet and his voice, a soothing, relaxed tenor, winds its way into your head like a velvet snake. This album is somewhat like an anti-Beck album. Beck's last, Sea Change, was an ode to a downtrodden lover. pollyanna could not be more different, despite sharing some aural complements. This album is like one long love letter, broken into 11 unique paragraphs. The whole production is relaxed and warm and sweet."
4,Good stuff for kids,"As a former college athlete who was ""wrapped"" by professional trainers, I'm very familiar with taping and wraps. This is a very good product for active kids to secure their bandaids or other dressings to contain Neosporin and such. Its value is in being lightweight, non kinking, very flexible, and surprisingly durable even when wet from swimming. Easy to take off and replace. It does need athletic or surgical tape to secure itself together--but that's what we did in college too.... ;-)"
2,Semi-lousy,"This wrap isn't very sturdy and doesn't hold up too well to everyday abuse. I used it to secure a burn dressing on my arm only because I did not have any vetrap, (by 3-M and is sold for veterinary use) which is sturdier and holds up to heavier use and sticks to itself much better than this product does."
3,A little boring,"I think Odonata is much better. I've listened Aphelion a few times and it seems to me that something is missing, I can't get in touch with this album."
3,Quality mainstream ambient music,"The people who own many Deep Forest, Enigma, and Adiemus albums will be pleased to add this to their collection for the occasional relaxing trip. However, dedicated ambient listeners accustomed to deeper voyages via Steve Roach, Robert Rich, Vidna Obmana, and other like artists will find this CD frustrating and insubstantial.Amethystium's music doesn't go very deep but it does sparkle brilliantly near the surface. Easy to appreciate and enjoy for casual listeners of all ages."
5,EUPHORIC!!!,"If a piece of music makes you cry from sheer exuberance, then you know you have found the one. Hurray for those who follow the path of their soul and allow the rest of us to journey along that beam...to see...to feel...to reach highter...Thank YOU! I love Odanata which I got by change, a good change... I had to find this one and OH MY!!! Close your eyes and dream..."
4,Fantastic video collection!,"This a great collection of videos from a great band. If you're a New Order fan, then you know these tunes and have seen at least some of these excellent videos.I've knocked one star off due to the abysmal ""NewOrderStory"" DVD. Shoddily produced, difficult to follow, poor sound quality, bizarre interviews (Bernard Sumner getting a haircut?), and pretentious narration. While it includes some excellent videos, these are made redundant by disc one. Easily one of the worst pop/rock documentaries I've seen.Shouldn't let that stop you though, for the price this set is still a steal for the videos DVD. Definitely a ""don't miss."""
2,"great videos,","With the exception of the videos and some of the interviews with the band members, I didn't like this DVD very much. The best DVD to have with the band members (Bernard, Stephen and Peter) is Joy Division the true story of the rise and fall of the band. I was very disappointed but enjoy seeing the videos and listtening to the music again."
4,Where is Waiting For The Sirens Call?!,"A good collection, but you have to buy the single of Waiting For The Sirens Call to get the last one (video)! The 2nd disc (NewOrderStory) is the same as the VHS from october 1993 wich itself is 140 minutes in length, so theres no extended version on this one, but its digitally remastered, so you get an overall better performance. That the whole thing is chronological is a benefit I think. Thanks!"
5,I Love this pair of shoe.,"This pair of shoe is so comfortable. The height of the heel is not too high which makes it very comfortable. You can wear it with everything. Very stylish, cute and comfortable. Would recommend it for everyone."
3,very pointy,"These were really point, the arch was awkward, I returned these. The heel was also wooden which I guess I overlooked in the picture."
2,Difficult to use,"I ordered some Flat Out containers because I liked the concept of the container flattening out for storage. I had also read a positive new product review. It's easy to push them flat for storage, but re-opening them is not easy. They don't pop back open, as I expected. You need to push and pull and wrestle them open. Too much bother, so they sit in the drawer unused."
3,A thoughtful effort,"I was somewhat misled by the title, thinking I was getting a book on contemporary Thai music, but I was pleasantly surprised by this thoughtful work. The author really devoted a lot of time and energy to develop a satisfying product. The book focuses on traditional Thai music and musicians, and the impact on modern Thai society. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Thai social life."
4,Kraftwerk!!!,"I noticed that nobody said something about Kraftwerk, the original artist of Das Model! I agree the cover of Rammstein is very very cool, but Kraftwerk also deserves some credits. Still, this single is very OK"
4,Taking industrial to a new level,These 3 songs bring out the techno out of their music. I have to say I like Kokain the best because of the good and dark sides of the music.But here is a warining... If your just getting it because its a cool game DON'T. You can find it on the net.All I have to say is keep it commin' Rammstein!!!!!(and the CD case is even cool)
4,Good but not the logical analysis I expected,"Peter Kreeft does show that the reformist where misguided in rejecting the cardinal virtues of Plato and Aristotle, just as we would be misguided by rejecting Newtonian Physics after learning Einstein's theories of relativity. You need to understand Newton in order to understand Einstein and you need to have a basic knowledge of logic and virtues in order to understand the Bible. However, he does not show exactly how the Cardinal virtues are derived from logic alone. Why only 4? Why isn't love a more important virtue than wisdom, fortitude, justice or temperance?"
3,death is Cassandra,In this book a teenager and his friends are trapped ina super theme park with rides from hell.Blake has to save his younger brother and friendswhile riding 7 rides before sun up.The whole show is run by a goddess named Cassandrawho reaps the souls of those who enter her park.Not quite sci fi this book comes off as fantasy.
1,no tilt at all,"This book absoulutley sucked. If you bought it it would be a waste of money. The beginning is hard to understand the middle is slow and the ending is absoulutley pointless. This book is a waste of paper, your money and your time. All in all if you bought this book you should check into a mental home."
3,Full Tilt was just ok,"Not bad, but not my favorite Shusterman book. Not as creative or emotionally involved as some of his other work."
4,"Fixed many of the problems of Nfl 2k, but........","Some of the things in Nfl 2k are better than Nfl 2k1. The graphics are great in this game, and the field looks more realistic. The commentary was great in Nfl 2k, but in this it is game, it is not as good. I was not very impressed by the game's plays. In Nfl 2k, the plays were at least plays that I've heard of. In this game, I never heard of most the plays. Not only that, they got rid of some of my favorite plays, such as Reverse, and The Bomb(which were in Nfl 2k.) I found myself picking plays because they had cool names.Overall, this was a good game, I just liked Nfl 2k a little bit better."
3,Great game until you try to step it up.,"When i first started to play this game on rookie i thought it was the best, untill i tried playing it on pro. Try passing the ball to Randie Moss in rookie and then to him on pro. He never makes a catch in pro but makes every catch in rookie. In pro the computer ALLWAYS seems to be at the perfect spot to make an interception. Try watching the replay, most of the times the defenders do not touch the ball but they myteriously block the pass. When you pass the ball there are like three defenders on you as soon as you pass the ball. If you do get a reciever open he drops it. The computer completes 99.999% of its plays on pro. This game has wonderfull graphics and is very realistic. I think if they are going to make pro that hard do not make rookie so easy or vice versa. If you cant make any plays in pro try catching the ball yourself. I love this game but i cant seem to move on from rookie. I beat the computer 124-0 and still cant beat the computer in pro."
3,Basically the same as NFL 2k,"Unless your life is video games, you will not notice much of a difference between this and NFL 2k. The online gaming is hardly worth it, it is nearly impossible to run the ball over the internet because of the lag, by the time you start running, you've already been tackled, the graphics are exactly the same, the ""update roster"" feature that is supposed to update the players throughout the season doesn't even work. Save your money."
5,NFL2K1 Greatest game,"You must own NFL2K1. If you like sports at all you would get this. The graphics are great. The players and the crowd react realisticly. Also create your own players, plays and even teams. Play in tons of mode including franshice. With every team and there own playbook. If you compare NFL2K1 to any other sport game. This one blows away the commpetition like dust. Dont fret get this game. NFL2K1 for game of the year."
5,NFL 2K1 is the best,"I think nfl 2k1 is the best football game out. I have played ps2 madden 2001 and it was a very disappointed game. It doesn't compare to 2k1 playable. If next year game has the static like madden, then 2k1 is the game for me"
3,No touchdown here,"Although this game is visualy impressive, it is not a Madden 2001, You have 3 difficulty levels which with most sports games easy provides absoluetly no challenge, bump it up to medium and you can barely score a touchdown. I've never had a quarterback go an entire quarter without a reception, receivers are wide open but they seem to always drop the ball this happens all the time with NFL2K1. The computer can't seem to do any wrong in this game. The good side of this game your blockers actually block, you can see your holes in the running gameif your looking for a fun realistic football simulation stick with Madden 2001, it's got 4 skill levels and many other fun goodies.To be fare I have not played this on sega net but have heard good things as long as you have a fast server. before you buy this one rent it and check it out yourself!"
3,If Randy Moss drops one more freakin' pass...,"I will keep it short and sweet:1. The AI is uneven as rookie level is easy as cake yet at Pro level almost every pass is dropped or intercepted yet the computer always finds a way to get open, catch ball....you will have at least three DB's/LB's around you at all times.2. In pro level your receivers drop almost every pass(actually, if you slo mo it, the ball never reaches the receiver's hands, it just mysteriously falls to the ground before reaching him3. The commentary is terrible, It will be be 3rd and three and they will say ""time to bring out the punting unit""-- turn it off"
3,its cool but not the greatest,i think its an awsome game except for the fact that its too realistic which is good in some ways but if you play madden or gameday or even nfl 2k you get confused because blocking passes and catching are hard...too hard. Id say stick with nfl 2k madden 2001 or gameday 2001 for a cool football game
4,extremely frustrating but also addictive!,"This is obviously a great game. However, can somebody please explain to me why in the world if you turn up the difficulty level to all-pro your recievers drop 90% of the balls that fall in their hands??? This is definitely the biggest problem with the game! It really takes alot of the fun away if you ask me. I know its suppost to be a realistic game but 10 drops a game is really not realistic, only if youre the Bengals or some crappy team like that. Is this just a bug in my game or is this happening to gamers around the nation also? Besides this extremely big problem I would have rated it 5 stars, however I sometimes want to just destroy this game into little pieces when the computer cheats making me drop balls when they were clearly beautiful passes to wide open recievers. Somebody Help!!!!"
4,Early review of a highly anticipated game,"This game is going to be above and beyond the previous version. First you can actually get a good running game going. Second the playing is more balanced, but these aren't the best features. The best thing is that you can download as the season progresses. That way if a player comes out of nowhere during the season your stats will reflect. That is the greatest part of this game. Maybe this will keep the market from having a new game every year. You can download an update players every year via VMU or memory card. Also the addition of online play and the downloadable upgrades, not to mention career mode and better graphics (if that's even possible) this will be the greatest football game ever. Eat your heart out PS2!"
5,A winner with My Son!,"I bought this for my son and he has played it for hours, he loves it! The graphics are great and he seems to love the game itself!"
4,Close to Perfect,"NFL 2K1 is a really great game. However, the graphics are not as perfect as Madden NFL 2001 for Playstation 2. It is really face paced and fun, but tings could be better."
4,A great guide for journalists,"As someone who occasionally struggles with leads, I found this guide quite helpful in working out some of the kinks and better using my creativity. I've read it cover to cover several times and my only complaint is that I wish it were longer!"
1,Biased against government,"I disagree with this book. As a former Washington DC bureaucrat, I happen to know there are two sides to every story, depending on who you ask. This book only presents one side."
5,"HOW IT USE TO BE, IS GREAT","THIS CD WAS REALLY GREAT, I LOVE THE VOCALS AND THE BAND. LYRICS WAS WONDERFUL, ELRIDGE WAS GREAT.LOLTHOMAS"
4,New ideas even for the experienced IS0 14001 practitioner,"This authors have produced a book which should be helpful not only to the new ISO 14001 practitioner, but also to those who have years experience. The book provide ideas on how to develop an EMS which is not complicated, with examples of easy to read procedures for the core documentation of an EMS. The included GAP Analysis questions shall provide direction to those implementing their first/own EMS. Recommend reading for all."
1,Nothing to read,"It looks like ISO 14001 requirements + ISO 14001 comments + a few words of own opinion + some procedures from imaginary company (It seems they have never been at work). So If you have visited any ISO 14001 course, you don't need this book."
4,Alot of fun to read,"This is a fun book I enjoy reading to my children. It is much shorter than the movie but its a great quick read before bedtime. Another great book I recommend is The Url King, by Beau Beaudoin. He has that same macabre yet silly style as Tim Burton, also written in rhyme and the illustrations are incredible."
5,product great- disappointment with amazon,"I love this book. My boyfriend is a huge fan of Tim Burton and all things ""Nightmare Before Christmas."" I ordered it as a Christmas gift, it got here in time as promised. However, I ordered and payed for a new copy and when it arrived the back cover was ripped and bent. I was very disappointed because it was a Christmas gift and there was no time to return it and get a new one."
2,"A beautifully illustrated story, but poorly written","The idea was great - a book based on Burton's classic, wonderful animated film. The illustrations are magical. However, they do little to disguise the awkward rhymes. The story itself has changed quite a bit from the movie, and the omission of the Doctor, Sally, Oogie Boogie and the three little henchmen makes the remaining story seem flat. Too bad, because I really wanted to love this and keep it as a Christmas tradition."
3,Not as good as I would expect,"This book has good Tim Burton illustrations and a rhyming story.But, it is not a good book for children because the story is not fun.It was not what we expected, since the story is sad and really doesn't flow well at all. It appears Disney is just trying to cash in on the movie's cult success with Tim Burton's illustrations. If the story had to be totally changed from the movie for this book, they could at least have made the story fun to read. Rhyming words is just not enough."
3,Not bad but only ONE ball,"The -single- ball that came with this order is as advertised, but I give this item 3 stars because the description above is misleading. Not only do all the pictures show six balls but the item description even uses the word ""balls"" instead of ball. Anyway, if you want just one ball to play with it's good, but if you want more than one you will pay for each ball separately."
5,Excellent Guide for Beginning Journeyers,"This is a book that I often recommended to people who have learned the technique of shamanic journeying. This book is the best one available for folks who have the technique and want to do more with it. It is easily understandable, and contains lots of helpful and valuable information. I have been teaching the Journeying technique for 10 years and recommend this book to new folks."
1,Beware!,"It looks like a great CD for an amazing price, but when you put it in you notice that Bruce Springsteen seems to have laryngitis. Then you notice that in the top corner of the CD it says ""Cover Versions."" So if you're looking for the real songs by the real artists, this isn't for you."
1,Picture doesn't represent,"I was looking for delicate salt and pepper shakers. When I opened the box, they were enormous! And the silver was slightly discolored. I wound up keeping the product because it would have cost more to return it than I paid for it. I will give them away next opportunity, or sell them cheap in a yard sale. Should have looked more carefully at the dimensions I guess, but the picture made them look nicer than they deserve!"
1,Not what i expected,The bookcase was not what i expected many nicks on the wood! The screws did not secure well.... which meant i had to go out and buy some other ones that would fight snug! not worth the money!
4,Nice,"Looks good, easy to put together, holds plenty of books and knick knacks. 5 stars exept it is a little rickety to move around once you load it down, for the price great,"
4,witty,"this is witty play about four guys who vow to sequester themselves for three years in serious study, but who are forced to forswear their vows when four attractive women show up and upset their plans. the humor is mainly in the form of wordplay, as only shakespeare can do, and the verbal jousting between berowne and his lady is especially entertaining, and anticipates the tete-a-tetes between petruchio and katherina in ""taming of a shrew"" and benedick and beatrice in ""much ado about nothing"". definitely worth a read, and if you can get it, the bbc television production of LLL is also worth seeing. last of all, i disagree with the other poster who complained of the ending. i thought it was pretty clear that the couples would get together in a year's time. so the ending was implicitly happy. only someone who is accustomed to instant gratification could find fault with it."
3,Fari Album.. but Great live!,"I'm writing this review in response to another person who was at the Hot Hot Heat concert in ottawa. I loved the French Kicks at that show and bought their album, even though i had never heard of them before that. they were entirely different than hot hot heat's dancable, high energy tracks. However, the french kicks mellow performance and too cool attitude sold me every which way. I like the album, but i don't love it. It is however a listenable, relaxed release with some stand out tracks (""Wrong Side"", ""Crying just for show"") I'd give this album 3 1/2 stars but the Amazon gods don't allow me too."
1,Boring or just bad,When I listen to a CD I rate it from 1 to 10. I gave this one a 1 which is to say it was hard to listen to the hole thing. I would not be able to sit through another. I was just looking up the CD's from my collection that got this 1 ranking and I just can't believe that anyone could take this CD seriously. Currently selling for 48 cents save your money!
4,Finally,"I love this bra and have searched long and hard. If you are a large chested woman, you know just what I mean. This bra is comfortable and supportive. Love it!"
2,disapointed,"Just plain not comfortable! I am a 38E. I wasn't looking for serious support necessarily, but comfort would be nice. I find myself itching and rearranging a lot. No separation of the girls. No moisture-wicking (I live in SW FL). For a high priced bra, I had hoped for more. Oh well, another lesson!"
2,not firm enough for aerobics,I got this to replace an old sports bra. It was not firm enough for running up and down our steps much less any cardio exercise. Maybe if your sport is speed walking this would be good for you.
2,Need wide shoulders for this one,Definitely not a sports bra. Very comfortable except that the straps slip down so quite useless for me.Not suited for larger than a B cup.
2,"Not a bad story, but needs editing...","The story wasn't bad. I like the fact the writer comes from Brooklyn and he kept it real about what goes on, but MAN! Where is the editing? Why the black publishers act as if all black readers speak ebonics? I think if the writer gets the second printing properly edited he'll get his point across a lot better."
4,Shows you the importance of tracing patterns and behaviours,John Bradshaw really gets you curious about your family history. I found out more about my family background in a month than I had my whole life. He shows you the importance of tracing patterns and behaviours back through generations so you can become aware of your own tendencies and avoid repeating previous generational issues. Truly fascinating!
1,Can't Rate the CD will not Play,"Costomers should beware of the titling on the amazon search results page for the John Williams CD, The Magic Box. The regular audio CD in not titled under Williams' name, but the super audio CD is. So with a quick look I bought the super audio CD by mistake. It will not play on my current system and sadly I still haven't heard it yet. Will Amazon take it back? Such are the vageries of ordering stuff on the internet."
3,Australia's Chic Falls Slightly Short...,"Though 'Vogue' has been around in Australia for quite a while, this magazine always falls slightly short in its aim. While maintain the usually commercial-heavy style, Vogue Australia manages to tone down the pretentious air (found in most other Vogue publications) and get stuck into the groundwork of some rather basic Australian designers. Good, but not great. Paris Vogue is undoubtedly the best still."
4,good,"great way to start liking Halo Reach, if you ONLY have a dreamcast.....outdated now, but still fun!"
4,Good but could be better,The controls are a little hard but only with the controller. The internet play is rather good altough i had to change my ISP (internet provider). If you want a shooting game buy it! Its ALOT better than unreal tournament!
3,Quake 3 Arena,This game is fun at first but it gets boring after a while. Plus the CPU in single player are extreamly hard even on easy.
4,fun and frustrating,"WARNING: If you don't have a keyboard and a mouse, you might consider buying them before you purchase this game. It's really impossible to play well using the game controller. You'll get blown away so fast as you try to aim. Aside from the game control the game is amazing. The graphics are outstanding, especially on a VGA monitor. The game play is fast. There is virtually no lag time on the broadband even with four players. On the 56K connection, there is an occational lag, and I have yet to be booted out of the connection. Of course, playing on-line is the key to this game. Online game play is extremely addictive. There are plenty of levels to chose from--I think 30 or so. One player game is fun too. But the opponents are tough (maybe because I am a beginner). I'd say this is one of the must-purchase games for the Dreamcast."
4,Good game,"Quake 3 has some of the best graphics i have seen on the dreamcast. Besides the graphics, the gameplay is good too. This game really shines in the multiplayer and internet sections. It is so much fun to play online against people, and frag the hell outta them! =) I only occasionaly recieve lag while playing online. It is also fun to play a split-screen game against your friened. Why not 5 stars? The single player game gets old, quick. Its just you in arena going against computer AI players. If only they made the gameplay like quake 2 it would deserve 5 stars. Still, overall its a great game. I only occasionaly recieve lag while playing online.P.S If you see ""TREND"" on a seganet server, prepare to be fragged! =)"
3,Good Enough,"After playing Unreal Tournament I expected, a lot more but what to do. Personally Dreamcast is my favourite console. I also have a PS2 nad a PSP but my favourite one is DC. First it's too hard to aim to your enemy and contorls are a bit too hard. Graphics are amazing and the sounds are ok. Specially the atmosphere is amazing. There are only a few of us Dreamcast users left and I think we should own every single game that we can find for it. Q3 is not a bad game. Unreal is much better but it is absolutelly better than the Rainbow Six series. And in multiplayer mod I had amazing fun with 3 friends of mine. So considering the price I can recommend you this game."
4,"Pretty good, but PC is better","Well, quake 3 is a very heavy game graphics wise, and the dreamcast certainly can handle it. I don't know if people knew this, but Dreamcast has better graphics than PS2. PS2 has a 4MB Vram, and Dreamcast has an 8MB Vram, allowing Dreamcast to display twice as much speed and graphics at a time, which negates PS2's better processor speed, no joke. If you don't belive me, go play Crazy Taxi for PS2, and then for Dreamcast and tell me what you think. Anywho, Quake 3 is a really good game with fast moving graphics, good single player mode, and a halfway decent online service. Although, the controls are a little funky. The PC version has better graphics, and is worth getting if yer PC has an AGP graphics card and a processor speed minimum of 300 MHz's."
2,Disappointment,"I live in a rural area with only one ISP available and this has presented a BIG problem when attempting to play Quake III Arena online.If I lived in a city where I could get Sega.net or had other options for Internet access this game would probably be fantastic to play but the constant *Connection Interrupted* with my lowly rural ISP has left me highly frustrated with this game.Unfortunately this one is going on the ""sell"" pile. :-("
5,Great Buy,"I received the item pretty quickly and am pleased with the purchase. I had compared prices for Die Bibel with book stores and found Amazon.com's price to be half that of book stores...that solidified, in my mind, where to purchase the book.The book is small enough to fit on your desk when you study using commentaries and other materials, but the print is not so small that you get a headache while reading. Everything, including appendices, introductions, text, and even the maps are written in German. (what one would expect from a German Bible)I highly recommend this Bible, if you are intending on purchasing a classic, well-translated German version of the original Scriptures."
4,Common sense information and advice,"Dr. Brazelton has a loving, common sense approach to infant development. He offers constructive advice and reassurance to new parents. This book is extremely helpful to first time mothers."
5,An excellent music activity game for kids AND parents!,"WOW! (and I mean that). This game is fantastic! All the Sesame Street humor, with really wonderful music and a lot of different activities. From Ernie's World (ala Wayne's World) where Ernie interjects funny words into songs sung by Cookie, Grover and Elmo to their hilarious disbelief (which had my wife and I on the floor laughing!), to Elmo's Music Machine (an endlessly replayable sampler/mixer of music snippets that let's kids put endless combinations of tunes together (an excellent learning tool! ), to Worldly Instruments where Elmo and Ernie play - in any combination - everything from Sitars and banjos to African drums and Trombones to, of things, a Hurdy Gurdy or a Theramine! As a musician and a parent who hopes to pass on the joy of music to my son and daughter, I could not believe our luck at finding this brilliant and wonderful product! My hat is off to Sesame Street with my endless respect and thanks! GO BUY THIS! WE ALL LOVE IT!"
2,Not Vista Compatible,"I sent this item to my 3 year old nephew and when my sister put it in her computer it bombed. Apparently it is not VISTA compatible. I had read somewhere online that it was, but apparently not. I am disappointed because I think he would have loved it."
5,My kid loves this -- especially the musical instruments page,"My kid likes the musical instruments page, where the talking globe describes the instruments, and the sesame street characters play them. I like the world of sound, but my kid doesn't like it very much."
4,Small,Scale was easy to use and could be calibrated. It was accurate out of the box. I don't think that it will handle large objects well.
1,Escali Liberta Pocket Scale,"I got the item. It was very portable, which I really liked, but it was chinzer than I would have imagine and it didn't even turn on. I sent it back and got a full refund."
1,I will never use Amazon again.,"Now I'm Mad ! I wrote a review every thing bad about the deceptive add, I also wrote that the seller gave me a full refund Amazon's rep. was rude and said I had to solve the problem myself and Amazon war not responsibile for the descriptions of products or the wording I had bought a B/W laser printer, what I receved was a part for a diffrent color printer and I emaild a copy of the add to Amazon and the seller.The seller did give me a full refund their people unlike Amazon's were very nice. Now about Amazon I'm through with them , even this review page has got me boiling after I first typed my review I droped down to TAG THIS PRODUCT(recommended) then it says (what's a tag) I clicked on that and that wiped my review off. Amazons add's are deceptive and now their review page is just as bad. Fred in Canton Ohio"
1,cause and effect,"This outdated product is suitable for children under 3 who are learning cause and effect. By 3, today's children have outgrown this game. Take it off the shelves or give it to a younger age group. The best thing about the product was its fast delivery and secure handling."
5,Toby Rocks!!,I own this CD got it directly from Toby Knapp himself and he even autographed my copy!! Thats one of the great deals you get when you know him as I do! But this is one of the most amazing instrumental CD's I have ever heard! Toby is a very gifted guitarist and one of the best!! Must buy very well done and never gets boring!!
4,Good for the Money,"I was just about to buy the red ones of these at Williams Sonoma- these were perfect. The inside dividers are cardboard. Plenty big for ""balloon"" type red wine glasses... really nice way to store things and for the money, I think they are comparable to anything you'd get at WS- and they are like half price. Pleased with product..."
5,This is a cool storage item,I do home spa's and we drink our detox tea during our spa. I was able to put a cardboard divider in this and an carry 24 glass coffee mugs safely. Love it!
2,Still need to use a lot of packing,Divisions are 4x4 inches so I still have to use a lot of bubble wrap even though I use the box for basement storage as I have limited cupboard space. The box would not be sturdy enough for a move. This makes the quilting and microfiber more for show than anything else as they do not protect the glassware. A bit pricy for its limited use
5,Nice and Sturdy!,"I bought this thinking well it would hopefully work to store many of my glasses while not in use (small kitchen). For the price, I am very pleased with how sturdy this container is. Frankly after reading the other reviews about this being made out of cardboard, I was skeptical. However, the cardboard is very thick and sturdy. I was also hoping that my martini glasses may fit in here but they don't so I suppose that's why they have a separate one for martini glasses.Would I buy this again? Definitely! It's strong enough that I feel comfortable not putting it in another box to protect the glasses more- which was the purpose of buying this product. It's also a lot cheaper than making it on your own (which is what I was going to do)."
5,Great Product,"Seller was very prompt with the delivery,item was well packaged and in perfect condition. A really nice way to store your fine crystal stemware."
4,Perfect for the price,Bought it to store water glasses between holiday dinners. 4x4x9.5 inch compartments are roomy enough for all but the biggest balloon wine glasses. Very easy to put together. The cardboard dividers are sturdy with vinyl trim on the top edge. The label on the outside is a nice feature. I plan to buy several more for other sets of infrequently used glassware. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I would have preferred a plastic or vinyl coating on the outside -- easier to wipe the dust off after a year in the basement! But that's a minor quibble.Arrived in one day with Amazon Prime.
5,Excellent piece.,"This is my new favorite piece of jewelry. I get comments on it all the time. I like the way the chain never causes it to turn around (with the clasp in the front) that is a problem with other pieces I have. The chain is a high quaity giving you three setting as to where it can be fastened. It is beautiful and durable. A good buy, I'm very happy with it."
5,Worth it!,"It's a good investment for me. As a beginner, I found that this is a great book to begin. Helps me to build a strong SQL foundation"
2,Great Job,"I am currently out to see and was surprised at how quickly I received it. Thank you. The rating scale isn't working, but product was perfect. Nothing wrong with it"
5,great 80's love songs,"i love this cd, it also have great love songs, i always listen to it in my car or in my home. it brings back alot of great memories. i also recommend this if you like 80's love songs:)"
4,If you love the 80's this is your CD,"Great to hear some of the greats form the 80's. A must for any true fan of the 80""s"
5,80's,"This cd is gratt. All the #1 hits. Great cd..The songs are good. Like never let you go, All out of love"
2,Not What I Wanted,"The line up of songs was just not what I wanted. Other reviewers warned about this, that there are different versions with different songs. I thought I would take a chance when the CD was 99 cents and got the one I didn't want. But the cover art is cool..."
3,Perfect with a few bumps,"The seller (InnovatePC) no longer (12/2012) offers this product, perhaps focusing on his PC products. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase: chassis was in top shape, LCD has no missing pixels, computer, USB, ethernet, modem and disk operate flawlessly.But there were glitches. The seller advised the buyer to read his ad carefully and I think the seller was making the point that this iMac G5 would NOT operate the 10.6.x version of the Mac OS and had no camera. However, the seller did not ship what his ad promoted in two aspects: 1) seller advertised that version OS 10.5 would be installed; however, it came with 10.4; 2) seller advertised 512MB of RAM and it came with twice that (thanks). After some positive discussions, I installed 10.5 and seller refunded the shipping costs and a little more for my technical efforts."
4,A Marvelous Slice of Melbourne,"A wonderful Australian friend of mine sent this book to me. He's from Melbourne and thought I might get a kick out of reading about some of the places he has so often told me about. This book captivated me from the very first page! So rich in Australian culture, the character studies are incredible. I think we all have a ""Jack"" in our lives no matter which continent we find ourselves on. I understand there are two sequels to this work and I am very anxious to read them as well. I highly recommned this book to anyone who wants to get a clear picture of what it is like to grow up in Melbourne."
3,"Inquiry-based, but not connected to real life problems","The strength of this book is that it lays out 35 detailed Chemistry experiments that are not cookbook labs. It has concrete examples of how to have students design their own procedures to solve a problem. When I first started reading the book I was very excited and thought I would definately use it. The farther I read though, the more disappointed I got that the labs do not include real-life connections. Most students are not inherently interested in ""Calculating the Heat of Solution,"" but could become more engaged if the author made a connection between each topic and a real-life problem. I think that a book that is far superior is ""Teaching Inquiry-Based Chemistry,"" by Gallagher-Bolos and Smithenry. It really explains how to get the students engaged in real-life inquiry-based problem solving and describes how to get them to do it as a community of learners."
2,Only Lasted One Month,"Unfortunately the handle on my shears shattered after 1 month. Until that that they cut very well, but I'm not so sure about the wooden handles. My suggestion is to get the shears below which have steel handles. They are also less expensive!Fiskars Power-Lever 10-Inch Hedge Shears #9177"
4,A good resource,"Although not the definitive word on Corel Photo-Paint 8 there are excellent tutorials, well written explainations and an overall enjoyable read."
4,Good basic manual BUT...,"I am most interested in .AVI, .MOV and animated GIF processing. As a moderately skilled Photoshop and Draw 5 user, I was pleased to see the ease of access to these formats that PhotoPaint 8 provides. Alas, I expect that I will have to wait for the WOW book to get to the ""expert tips"" that I crave in this area. But I would recommend the book as a good intro to the program and it will take most new to midrange users skill level up a notch."
2,Should have proofed it before publishing,"I'm currently working through this book, and I am finding so many mistakes in this book, it's appalling. Spelling, punctutation, incorrect menus, incorrect directions. It's becoming quite frustrating. Sure, it's written in a conversational style, but that's quite annoying sometimes. The author spends more time trying to make smart remarks about the subjects than actually explaining them."
3,"Ok, kind of...","I echo J Tomich practically all the way. I regret buying this book, it's just too much hassle to return it from Europe. I expected much more from SD. The only pattern that is interesting is the camisole, which is like something out of Vintage Knits. I can imagine this book being published under the name Simple Knits, but if Erika Knight had done it it would have been quirkier.Oh - and what's with the grouping of patterns under colour stories? Hello, book editors - knitters don't want to have to leaf thru a whole book to find a pattern! Whatever happened to contents pages?"
2,Sarah Dallas has done better work,"I almost pre-ordered this book because I'd liked stuff Sarah Dallas has designed for Rowan. I'm glad I didn't buy it. This is not a knitting book I'll be adding to my (extensive) collection. The chapters are organized around color themes, which I think is ridiculous -- I want a knitting pattern to be about the shaping of the garment itself, because that's what I'll be doing. Thaks, Sarah, but I can pick my own yarn colors. None of the designs are interesting or original from a design standpoint, from what I saw. They're all fine, but they're pretty generic. If you already own a lot of books and knitting mags, you've probably got a few dozen patterns like these already. If you want a book that's well written, gorgeous and actually innovative, (and a more interesting buy for intermediate and advanced knitters) I'd recommend ""Loop-d-loop"" by Teva Durham."
2,Not Impressed,I found the patterns to be lacking orginality and honestly there was nothing that I would make for anyone. It also seemed to me that the patterns all looked the same with just different colors. Don't waste your money on this one.
3,A disappointing yarn,"I loved this book when it first came out 5 or so years ago. I think because of the beautiful photography, so recently I got it used as I am in my knitting frenzy. Couldn't wait to get it. Boy, what a disappointment, great on pictures short on interesting patterns. Alright already with the blankets! Anyone can put a few blocks together! Love the mittens but they are repeated in ""Vintage"" a book I really like. As mentioned above not very inspiring and not a lot of patterns everything kind of looked the same blankets and jackets. Vintage is a much better book."
2,Gucci Rush,"I bought this as a gift, the only thing is the bottle was scratched and the box was beaten up from shipping, but all in all it was fine."
5,Fantastic game,"I ordered this game from Amazon as an addition to our collection of other Jumpstart games ( we have the Preschool, Kindergarten and 1-2 grade games). It only took a few seconds to install and my 5 year old son loves it. He has been been playing with it for almost an hour now and has already learned to use a map and a compass and followed Marco Polo on a silk road to China... while in ""China"" he learned about the country, it's history as well as it's culture, flora and fauna.(there are also Egypt, the Inca empire and many other places to explore and learn about) Cannot recommend it enough. It's the best $5 you will ever spend on a child's toy.."
4,Great game for young and old!,"Hello, and welcome to my review! This game taught me and my older sisters a whole bunch of facts about Ancient Egypt, the Pilgrims, China, and Antarctica. You go to different times and places to play educational (sometimes) games and to do an interactive hide-and-seek game. The most annoying thing is that when you replay the game on the same user you miss some of the games and cutscenes that you get the first time. There's also a maze game that's REALLY boring and hard, it also doesn't teach anything. You can skip it but they don't make that clear at all. One of the great educational games is a brief quiz about the place you're going to. Despite my criticism, this is a great game. Sincerely, Chocolate Dog."
3,Online generation,"I received this DVD ; everything OK, but so far I haven't been able to watch it because of the difference in regions. I hope my kids will help me solving this problem."
3,Why all the fuss?,"I like Frontline, I really do.But I can't work up any concern for the ""dangers"" of internet culture. Two reasons: 1.) It is not going to ""go away"" or be ""changed"" no matter how ""sincerely concerned"" some people are about it and 2.) A society of kids on the internet can't be less than 500% of an improvement over a society of kids watching television."
4,great movie,"Drew B. is my very favorite actress. When I heard that Drew was going to age in the film and have a son who was played by an actor not much older than her, I was skeptical. Even when I saw the adult scenes between them two I was still a little skeptical. After I watched their interaction with each other all my skepticism went out the window. lolRICWB is an very good movie. I loved it. Drew was excellent in the role of Beverly and with her character aging in the film she pulled off playing the different ages very well. Just about everyone did an great job. Although, Adam Garcia was playing an american I could hear a little bit of his australian accent, so I gave it 4 stars. He was good nevertheless. The boys who played Jason were all so cute and adorable. :)Sometimes I thought Beverly was too selfish or Ray just needed to get his act together, but everyone's human. I laughed. I cried. And I can't wait to watch it again. :)I highly recommend this film."
3,Could Have Been Better,"This movie could have been better. I read the book before seeing the movie and I was sooo disappointed. I thought the book was realistic and fantastic. I thought it was great that someone would share their life like that considering things weren't the greatest. However, the movie was NOTHING like the book. If you've read the book I don't recommend seeing the movie but if you haven't read the book yet, watch the movie then read the book to see the real story."
5,Riding in Cars with Boys,"This was a wonderful movie; however, it was not what I expected based on the previews. It realistically showed the consequences of teenage pregnancy and/or marrying an idiot.I will have my daughter watch this one before she starts dating. Maybe it will make her think about the seriousness of certain actions."
2,The only good thing,This movie was dragged on and stretched out to far. The only good part of the movie was Desmond Harrington.
2,Riding?!? More like Parking.....,"I usually like Drew Barrymore, but this was not one I would recommend to anyone. Way too long, too hard to follow as it bounced back and forth in time, mostly showing us the worst the US has to offer in the world of white trash and heroin addiction. Not worth the money, the time or the effort to bother with. Girl goes out in car with guy. Girl gets knocked up. Girls marries worthless, drunken, addicted guy. Eventually she leaves and hopefully makes something of herself and finally lets go of her son. Scramble this and put it in slo-mo and that's the movie. Don't bother."
1,Bring a Barf Bag,"Drew Barrymore is beautiful and talented; ""Riding in Cars with Boys"" is cheesy and boring.This story was a mess. The flashback of Drew's character in the 1980s to when she was a girl, then a teenager, then an adult--it was chaotic and completely uninteresting.When the main character is in her mid-30's you can actually see in Drew Barrymore's eyes, that she's TRYING to act mature, for the role. Bad acting!Speaking of bad acting, the ""dramatic"" scences with the two little kids was just plain SCARY! I don't, nor anyone for that matter, want to see six-year old's breaking down and spouting scornful words like adults! It's like watching adults act like babies!This movie could've been good if there less flashbacks, less melodrama, less length to the movie!"
4,Greatly under-rated,This film was greaty under-rated. In fact the trailers were edited in such a way that they misrepresented the film. It is NOT a flaky chic flick. It is a well presented story of one woman's determination to make something of herself in spite of great odds.Barrymore gives a convincing performance - perhaps her best yet.There are funny moments and poignant sad ones. Very thought provoking movie that should be required viewing for all teenagers.
3,Movie does do the book to justice,"I know, I know, the movie is never as good as the book. But some movies based on books at least capture the essence and theme of the book it is based on. This film, sadly, does not. In the film version of Riding in Cars with Boys I found it VERY hard to sympathize with the lead character, Beverly Donofrio, played by Drew Barrymore. She gets pregnant young, marries beneath her, experiments with drugs, and borders on negelecting her son. In the book, Donofrio does all these things, but manages to straighten up, get into college, graduate with a BA and move to NYC to pursue her writing. Barrymore does a fine job acting in this film, but the story would have been better if it had not have skimmed over Donofrios achievements and focused on her coming of age mistakes."
2,Not the comedy the trailers speak of.,"This movie is a strict drama. That alone doesn't get it a bad rating, mind you, but the misleading trailers and tv commercials were unfair. My wife, being a teenage mom, expected to see a lighthearted movie about growing up with your kids. This movie is about getting beaten down over and over again for a decision that Drew makes when she is very young, in the end all is grand, but the journey is a mine field of hate, mistrust, and resentment...."
1,Not True to the Book at all,"What a betrayal of the book, which was a story of a teenage mother who beat the odds and got a great education while raisng a good son who liked her. What happened? This movie is filled with so much hate and betrayal, that by the end there is not a single character worth caring about. Besides that it is horribly directed, i felt sorry for the talented actors who were left screaming and shouting in this pitiful story. I don't remember a movie, even movies with war and explosions, that hurt my ears as much as this screamfest. It almost was a horror film."
1,Riding in Cars with Boys,I am a huge Drew fan but even my admiration for her could not save this movie. This movie is horendous. The main character Bev is a horrible mother! I think Jason would have been better w/ his junkie father. I can't believe this is based on a memoir; that someone would write such an unflattering depiction of themselves.
1,"Riding in cars ""ON"" boys",Nothing but a lame excuse to show the overrated Barrymore's face on the screen again.
4,A must see!,"Definitely a must see! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's a movie that really makes you think, and as we know, these are becoming more and more rare these days. I really enjoyed Drew Barrymore's performance. It was all so real! The movie can be a little drawn out at points, but overall this is an A+ rated movie! :)"
4,Drew is great!,"This is a well acted, well written movie. Based on a true story, Drew Barrymore is excellent portraying Beverly, a young girl who just wants to get out of her small town, go to college, and become a writer. Her goals don't quite match up with her reality, however, and the result is a very touching, often funny, and often poignant look into the life of a young woman coming of age in the late 60s."
5,AWESOME,"I saw this movie not too long ago. It was a 5 star movie. It was very real. How the life of Beverly was, it was really interesting. This story did not just happen to her it happened to alot of girls in the 60s. It was very emotional. With Penny Marshall it was the same thing. This movie is special. The cast fitted them and it was very funny. Some of it. Also some of it was sad."
4,Riding In Cars With Boys... I love this movie.,"This is a great movie. I love it. So glad Amazon carried it, as I could not find it in any local stores. I am not impressed however, that it came with a torn inside cover... very disappointing Amazon!"
5,Great fun,My sister told me about this movie. And i'm glad she did. I really enjoyed. From start to finish it's a winner. Drew character finally grew up in the movie.
3,Very True To Real Life,"Personally, I found this movie to be quite entertaining. I enjoyed that it showed the reality behind life changing decisions, the real world as opposed to a hollywood glam version of the story. I found the film to be fun and light hearted but mixed with hard hitting reality. If for no other reason, watch this one when you're having a bad day and feel like things couldn't be worse... the character Bev clearly shows you that they can be."
3,Cute movie,This was entertaining but a little bit of a downer. I still enjoyed the movie and I like Drew Barrymore as an actress. I would rate it a C+.
1,cheaply made!!!,"When I recieved it!! It was dented.I'm very mad. I didn't return it because it's very heavy and I have to put in the box. Seal it up. It's to much trouble. Also, It scratces easily and hard to put together. Very cheap!!!"
5,Great Worktable,"This is a great work table, sturdy, and easy to assemble. However, I bought mine at Sam's Club for $109.00. Love it."
4,Excellent biography of a successful U-boat Commander.,"This book about the experiences of Peter Cremer and his Unterseeboot (U-boat) U-333, also known as the ""Three Little Fishes"" because of his conning tower crest of three little fish, reads fairly easily, and will impress the submarine and naval history reader as well as anyone seeking interesting reading of any kind with U-333's amazing exploits. It is testimony to the daring and courage of the U-boats commanders and crews who attempted to make a difference just as our own American sub commanders and crews did in the Pacific against the Japanese Merchant Marine. Definitely worth reading. Some amazing original wartime photographs of U-333's survival of a ramming by an American tanker off Florida as well."
5,Good book to read...,"I consider this book to be rather better than Bucheim's ""Das Boot"" (although that movie was excellent)...Cremer's account is very readable, in a more straightforward way, to me. He was a true submariner - Bucheim was not (he was a military journalist). And Cremer remained in the naval industry after the war if I'm not mistaken...I'm not certain which book was written first, but obviously both were written some time after the war so one must wonder how different they would have been had they been written sooner. Perspective changes with time)...Bottom Line: I highly recommend Cremer's book."
4,All in one package,I love this because it has all of my favorite Janis Joplin songs in one package. After careful review of the many CD collection with this excellent singer decided this was the one for me. Wished all the songs was on one CD instead of two but one can't always have everything....
3,Not the best out there...,"You get what you pay for. This short book provides enough info so that one has a VERY basic understanding of Japanese grammar and sentence formulation. Some of the vocabulary is outdated and it could have been written with a more readable layout, but then again, you get what you pay for. Okay for the beginner, but certainly not as a standalone."
3,first time buyer,i have never bought anything online until i needed to get cheaper books for school. Dont expect it to be in the greatest condition. I can defently tell that my book was used and you get what you paied for.
3,Captures unique local flavor,"As someone who grew up in a haunted Massachusetts home built in 1788, I can admire the authors' appreciation of the value that the Cape Cod community places on preserving its historical & generational traditions. The authors have captured the local flavor of this unique heritage quite well.However, while the local lore is enjoyable and I appreciate the authors' lack of embellishment, several of the stories failed to hold my interest for long. Although I liked that the stories are first-hand accounts of ghost encounters, rather than another book of rehashed tales from the past, some of the story-tellers ramble a bit, and several of the stories could have done with a more selective editing job.The book does have its strong points, and some of the more pithy stories are page turners. However, overall, I found Mark Jasper's ""Haunted Cape Cod & the Islands"" a more engaging read."
1,Confusing,I thought this book was very confusing. I never knew if they were talking about the real Lucie or the doll Lucie. I also thought that this book was very boring. There were barely any exciting parts at all. I am in sixth grade and I still did not understand it. I think this is a bad book for younger kids to read but it might be a little more understandable for older kids if they read it.
1,Awful,"When I read this book in 4th grade I always got confused. Now I'm a 6th grader and I'm still confused about it. I never knew if Lucy's little house was real and she was living in it or it was really a dollhouse. The 1st and 2nd and 3rd persons always changed and it really didnt make any sense. I have to say at leat one or two parts was exciting so I'm giving it a one/ I would give a 0 but there is none. This book was just very confusing for young kids and not very easy to follow and not very adventuresome. Awful just awful. Although I did like Behind the Attic Wall another book by Cassedy, but i;m very dissapointed with her work in this book. Just Awful!"
2,Great movie - poor copy,"This is a great movie, but the version I received from Amazon is not so good:1. English subtitles in this copy are terrible (it's difficult to read them).2. Quality of this copy is not good (the picture is not so clear and not so sharp)3. Several minutes of the original movie is missing in this copy (I wonder why)Loves of a Blonde - Criterion Collection"
2,Drab,"This Czech film from the mid 1960s is a drab piece of socialist realism, in the form of a quite bitter comedy (by Milos Forman, one of the most overrated filmmakers ever). The story: Milda, a young pianist goes to drab industrial small town to play one night, meets the bird-brained working class blonde Andula during the ball, they make love at his hotel room, he returns to Prague, she breaks with her boyfriend after a fight, and decides to go to Prague to meet Milda. As it happens, the pianist lives with his parents, who are totally opposed with Andula staying at their rundown apartment (not that Milda wants her to stay). It is a quite artless film, and it is also ugly the way Andula is treated throughout. Only redeeming feature is Jana Brejchova's affecting performance as a not very bright person who seems to have been bruised more than one time by life."
3,Milos Forman enters the spotlight.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Loves of a Blonde, with the original Czech language title of ""Lásky jedné plavovlásky"" is another important film of the 1960's Czech new wave movement. The film gave director Milos Forman his first Academy Award nomination. The Criterion edition is also fully approved by the director.The film is about a young woman desperate for a boyfriend. when a pianist comes to town she thinks she found the man of her dreams, but will the relationship last?The Criterion edition contains only two special features which are a deleted scene and an interview with Milos Forman."
3,MDFMK,"It's just the MDFMK single reissued with a different name as far as I can tell. I agree that it's not really worth getting because of the price, but depending on how much of a completist you are, it might be worth getting."
3,Maybe...,"I saw Purdy's comments on CSPAN last night. He says that apathy drives young people away from politics. Or maybe it could be that in today's political climate, being political serves only to draw the kinds of rhetoric observed in the criticisms of his book. I'm not saying he's right or wrong. Its absurd to assume that we could some up the American political landscape, much less the ambitions of the American twenty-somethings in a few pages. So why try? The culture of apathy existing in today's young people was bred by Baby-Boomers disenchanted with politics after Watergate and disheartened that the spirit of the social-activism in the 1960's was left in ashes. If young people today want to know why their generation is the way it is, they ought to ask their parents and then pick up a copy of Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas."
2,Irony and apathy are not the same thing.,Shockingly narrow for such a lofty subtitle. How can one even begin to open up a dialogue regarding civic life and not mention any history of western political thought earlier than then 17th century? Not to mention the glaring absence of Soren Kierkagaard. Purdy's train of thought conviently omits all theistic rhetoric and it's role in political and civil discourse. Completely absurd.
1,You're better off re-reading Thoreau,"This book was so tedious that I ended up returning it after one day. It's not a terrible book; it is, however, obvious that the author is too inexperienced to offer much more than cliches. In ten years, after he's lived a little, maybe he'll write something worth reading."
1,The Irony,"Here is the most ironic event of the decade. A literary Osmond brother ... squeakly clean farm raised boy telling the entire world how evil they are, marketed as The Next Big Thing, whose books will quickly be remaindered and who will be forgotten as quickly as the pop stars that this book condescendingly mocks. But what more is this book than another symbol of our pop culture star driven age? All style, absolutely no substance."
1,Ivy League or IV drip? Spare us.,"Wasn't irony devised in order to counteract the self-righteousness of individuals such as Jedidiah Purdy? I mean, forget his book, just read the ""Author's Notes"" on this very page for a taste of the man's preening nonsense."
1,Hardly a fresh voice,"Jedediah purdy is not a particularly fresh voice. In fact, we have had sanctimonious prigs for thousands of years. Why would anybody want to encourage this snivelling pup in writing another whining and insignificant screed."
4,Civility and Responsibility defined @ Y2k,"Jedediah Purdy's For Common Things goes on my bookshelf waiting for future works of this un-common young man who wrestles and struggles with concepts that are all to often foreign to his peers. At age 24 Mr. Purdy seems to be ready for a trip to China where his disposition towards understanding and optimism would be understood; nurtured and expanded. His fierce talent and passion will evolve over time into something special, I believe. Perhaps the twentysomething crowd up will wear Jedediah's commitment to being visible and active in their community as their new red badge of courage. Less Seinfeld and Wired magazine and more Jedediah Purdy somehow seems like a good thing to kick off the new millennium."
1,Worthless,"Utter gibberish. Ignorant, stupid, utterly bereft of humor, humanity or wisdom, a childish tome written by a childish scold with no understanding of the world. Purdy should not be blamed for this dismal juvenilia but his publisher should be publicly pilloried. How can writing as ponderous and pointless as this get into print? Just think abou the people whose books were turned down so this could be printed. If you want to get a sense of Purdy's generation read A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers, a book that uses irony to brilliant, humorous effect and shows someone who has dealt with real difficulties in his life, not some pious, over-privileged brat who feels he has a right to lecture people at such a tender age."
1,Sick of Socialist Dogmas,"I'm sick of Socialist slime like Purdy. His book and his ideas are a waste of your time and life. If you'd like to read about the effects of his ideas in America, read ""Freedom in Chains"" by Charles Bovard."
1,The Straight Dope from a Straight Dope,Never before in the history of the English language has one struggled so hard to write so much about so little. A monument to the failings of the human brain.
2,This boy's running for office when he turns thirty-five,"This boy's running for office when he turns thirty-five, you bet your bippy. And he'll be a Yale graduate by then, so he'll have what it takes to win. He's a real square, all right, and power-hungry to boot, and a successful self-brander, and I can't say I'll be excited to see him run. I can say he's no future Gearge W Bush, but reading the post-script to the paperback, he looks to me like another Obama-- an aggressive and successful self-marketer, good at tooting his own horn but too detached from his own instincts and too focused on having everybody's affection to accomplish anything real. So far."
4,Stick and stones may break some bones...,"...but words are what Purdy excels at. Yet he is not limited to his extraordinarily deft touch with language. His concepts in For Common Things reach beyond the kind of psychobabble that usually passes for wisdom in this Spandex society -- agree with him or not, he is a thinker, someone Mark Twain would have gotten drunk with. I myself would like to raise a glass to this intelligent and incredibly gutsy young author. I found his book thought provoking, astonishing, and challenging -- never boring or superficial. He has one trait which distinguishes, and doubtless made his ascent possible: authenticity. Many will break their necks in their hasty attempt to degrade and minimize his work; for those like him, that is the price of being admitted to the pantheon of respected authors. Do not hesitate for an instant."
1,Old Edition,"I didn't Know this was a very old copy, not much information needs to be up date! Good for my Animal Library"
4,delicious cookies,"The tin is quite large - might recommend buying a smaller tin - and the cookies should be put in a plastic bag after you open the tin, otherwise they get a bit stale. But they taste delicious with coffee!"
5,She hung the moon,"There are lots of compilations of George Jones, and this is a very decent one. What decided me to buy it was that this is the only cd currently available that has 'She hung the moon' on it. Obviously I like that, and I think you will too. At this price it's worth buying for that track, but even if you've already got the better known hits on this, there are a lot of other lesser known ones, which are also very good."
4,BEWARE: VERY HARD GAME,"Ok, I'm sure if you read any reviews before this one you got the picture, but just in case: This is a gorgeous game. I mean the kind of game that makes you feel like you're really there. But then you get over that and realize you've got a game to play. So anyway, the story's confusing, and sort of stupid, but the game's really pretty fun. You could spend hours jumping and swimming, as long as you don't get seasick. The biggest problem is that this game is hard. Unfairly hard. Evilly hard. Or maybe it's just me. But I don't think it is. I gave up on the first level and looked at a walkthrough I found on the internet. I still couldn't do it. I recommend this game anyway, especially if you're a skilled gamer. If you have no patience, try something else."
2,"Ecco the ""no fun"" Dolphin","At this very moment I am suffering from a terrible headache. I usually endure this type of pain when I am stressed out at work or when I encounter a stress enducing videogame. Yep, you guessed it, playing this game has steered me straight to my medicine cabinet. Let me begin by warning fun oriented gamers to avoid this nerve grating game at all cost. It is a hideously executed game filled with arduous task after task after task. I feel I'm being punished each time I play this game. With Ecco, the only thing that matters is the stunningly gorgeous environments. Of course, this is inadequate. Where's the fun of completing a long task or the reward of enduring a difficult challenge? If you want to punish a child for a misdeed, force him to play this awful game. For those of you brave enough to withstand Ecco, I advise you to buy a hint book, otherwise DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE."
3,"Pretty graphics, boring game","Yes, yes, this game does have nice graphics- but after playing it for 5 minutes I got bored. I don't have attention deficit disorder, it's just that I found this game to be very slow and a little bit too serene for me. If you enjoy sports games and action games, don't get this one. I reccommend it either for young girls or, well, young girls."
2,"""Ecco the Dolphin"" Sinks","This game has great graphics, great underwater AI, and Ecco is just like a real dolphin, but this game is TOO puzzling. I only managed to get past the first level. I regret buying it. Don't buy it."
4,"A classic, but understand it has been edited","This is a great book, but not exactly as you might remember it if you read it as a child. Some of the editing for the current version is simple updating; the Empire State Building was ""the tallest building in the world"" in the 1960 edition, for example, but is now ""one of the tallest"" in the current version.Other edits are not as clearly necessary. The reference to the gun on the traffic cop's hip has been removed, leaving one of the visual jokes unexplained. While it might be thought that a reference to firearms in a children's book would offend modern sensibilities, the accurate illustrations of huge cigarette and beer billboards in Times Square are left in place. A puzzling decision."
5,charming classic for kids,"I loved books as a child, but alas, I never owned this one. Yet even without the nostalgia, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it with adult eyes and the illustrations are captivating. I like that New York ""is full of the Biggest Things"" from ""biggest Sunday papers"" (it's true!) to ""biggest traffic jams."" Sasek's book takes kids from Harlem to Chinatown, and the very last page offers up-to-date facts. Great for little children. If your kids (or niece or granddaughter) are older (age 7 to 13), get her Melanie in Manhattan which is also set in New York -- my hometown -- and takes kids from Harlem to Chinatown with stops on the Empire State Building and Brooklyn Bridge. Happy Reading and Happy Traveling! melaniemartin.comCarol Weston author of MELANIE IN MANHATTAN and other books for kids"
3,Printing is just OK,"The book is very nice. But just as a previous reviewer mentioned, the printing is not as colorful as the copy that I saw in store..."
4,"Not their best, but much better than the rest","Our Little Secret is not the Lords of Acid's best album. Lust is. Period. But this is not by any means a bad CD. Your usual shock value is there on all of the tracks, but along with that is a great sound. It's unfortunate that they don't get more airplay because the music that goes along with the lyrics (that I love, go ahead, call me a pervert) is great. It really makes you want to move and have fun."
5,One word: AMAZING!,This album is great! The variety of songs on the album itself is superb. Ilove this CD.
4,LOA,"lords of acid is by far one of the most original groups out there with their entirely own sound...this album is pretty solid, (...) its amusing and actually good all at the same time. This is a great cd to listen to while ur walking to class or background music while working...its definatley not something to sit and analyze...but it always puts a smile on ur face, one of the better LOA cds"
2,History VS Mythology,"Greeks are desperately in need of myths to give them a sense of pride about the past and optimism about the future. They create myths out of historical facts. For example, Greece has been a nation of crooks since its conception. Take the 40 million pound loan from the Central Bank of England made by the Filiki Etereia for the 1821 revolution. Do you know how many pounds actually made it to the balance of the the new Greek state? 190 thousand only. The rest ended in the pockets of the leaders who we have come to glorify as heroes. This is just one example of how facts are altered to create myths which sound better in our ears. Ellines ksypnate. An i xwra sas einai naxei ena kalytero mellon, aste tin mythologia stin akri kai psaksete yia ta pragmatika istorika gegonota kai na didaktoume apo ta lathi tou parelthontos etsi oste na min ta epanalavanoume. Aliws i ellada tha pigainei apo to kako sto xeirotero opws idi symvainei. Exei kanatnisei to perigelo tis Evropis."
3,Not the best protection,"I bought this to protect a flash drive I bought. It's comfortable, and looks nice; but the ""flap"" doesn't overlap enough for me. What's another 5cm of material, fellas? Come on; splurge a little!"
5,The best!!!!!,I received this cookbook as a Christmas gift over 20 years ago and it is still my favorite. The Fudge Nut Oat Brownies are legendary in our house. Everything I make from this cookbook is extraordinary. From Chicken Pot Pie to Blueberry muffins. I am thrilled to see it offered again. Truly a treasured book in my house. Now that it is available I will purchase for gifts.
4,Very good for what it is.,"Bob Kulick/Billy Sherwood tribute albums tend toward note-for-note replications of the source material and are hence often a bit boring. Strong talent is sometimes wasted by not being allowed to put its own stamp on the music. This (second) Aerosmith tribute, then, is a pleasant surprise. The versions are relatively faithful, but there is more room for interpretation, and the overall 'vibe' and energy is good. ""Eat the Rich"" grooves well, Bobby Kimball and Glenn Hughes turn in stand-out vocal performances, and Steve Lukather gets to really cut loose on guitar. Kudos as well to Doug Pinnick for a fine performance of ""One Way Street."" This is one of the better rock tribute albums of its kind."
2,Booo! Over dramatic and a bit too camp.,"I recently purchased Moby Dick online because of the reviews on Amazon but found it to be irritating. It was very expensive but I made the purchase anyway, really looking forward to being taken on an epic voyage. Unfortunately it was a big let down. If you're English imagine Graham Norton doing `Jackanory', toned down a few notches.His slight accentuation of every utterance in the book was like Chinese drip torture, driving everything home resulted in a camp drama school rendition with no space for the listener to do any of the work... nothing could breathe.I tried to listen so many times, but each time I could listen for shorter and shorter periods until just picking up the headphones made me queasy."
5,Brilliant narration!,The narrator does a terrific job of bringing this fantastic book to life. An absolute must hear! You must listen to this work if it is the only audiobook you ever listen to.
2,Scentsy,"This is not the ""Jane"" Scentsy warmer! Also, these are not ""Scentsy"" prices! Way over priced! This is not the way Scentsy does business!"
3,uncut action 100%,"this was a ggod start but i wish that viz media chould have two scripts for the voice actors, one for the edited kiddish version, and one for the teen and adult version, i just hate it wheb the characters dont cuss and say what they really mean to say, cuss words would make this series as funny as bleach! but 3/5 sorry......"
5,Unpretentious fun!,"The great thing about the Naruto series is it has an involved, ongoing storyline without taking itself too seriously. The episodes are well translated and the actors well chosen. It has some suspense and alot of comedy and for older children it has a nice message of never giving up on your dreams.My small gripes are that for some reason Naruto has the catch phrase of ""Believe it!"", and it gets dropped into places that it doesn't make any sense, but it's a small problem.Also the extras you get are really fun and high quality. This is a great package for the hardcore fan and newcomer alike!"
5,worth the buy,"Naruto is one of the best anime of it's time. this collection comes with both english and dubbed versions of the series, I started with watching the dubbed years ago but I still love the english version of this show that is how well Viz did on converting the show and with this set the English version is fully uncut all the blood and sexual themes are still intact and now has the orignal openings from the Jap version not that crappy one from cartoon network the bonus features are great too and the sketch book was interesting to look at but I would have prefered a Manga but oh well maybe next set which I am anticipating greatly. I have been watching this series for years in dubbed form and I am still in love with it till this day Dubbed or English it is all good so I highly suggest this set for any vet of the show and anyone who has never seen Naruto definetly needs to pick this up it's worth it."
4,What a beginning to a great anime,"This is a very good anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I can't wait until more season box sets become available. Make sure you buy this if you are an anime fan. Naruto is the best amateur ninja around. Have fun watching this action comedy.""Believe it"""
2,Naruto is great,"but the box set is utterly lacking. Naruto as a series is a great anime, one of Japan's greatest, but the box sets divides the series up into twelve episodes each, which is a huge rip-off. Anime should always be divided by seasons, like the Bleach box set. Oh well, I guess this s my first and last purchase of a Naruto box set. [...]. Here's a hint; Naruto has 209 dubbed episodes. Divide that by twelve and you get 16, though they'll probably release a 17th for the last episodes and some special features. [...]. If you're a collector then go for it, but otherwise don't waste your time, or your money."
5,Great,I have read many cat books but this one is the best. It is fun reading and taught me so many things that I didn't know. Warren is the best.
4,Remincent of Ummagumma,"This was my first exposure to Faust. This is a talented band along the lines of experimental space rock. This live disc is most impressive in that they come up with moods you would not think as possible in a live setting. I make the reference to Pink Floyd's Ummagumma (sp?) record as the space rock is dark with elements that are reminiscent of the live part of that album, but it is also clearly Faust, as Faust has their own unique sound. Great spin!"
1,vague over-generalizations,Poorly research thesis documents. Stereotypes used as true explanations and over generalizations being applied to explain the psychology of millions. A attended UC Berkeley if i was to use the material on this book as fact i would be ridiculed by my professors. There are far better references out there.
2,"nice, but not too impressive","In this anthology, a range of psychological issues affecting Latinos (though here they say Hispanics) are discussed. Topics include minority stress, HIV/AIDS, smoking, education, and more. The contributors have Spanish and non-Spanish last names, thus suggesting this book was a multicultural collaboration. This book effectively brings psychology and ethnic studies together. The chapters are quite short and easy to read. Still, the book felt flat. There is not much to learn here. This book would only be useful to undergraduate psychology majors and not many others. I mean, it's an okay survey book. I just wasn't blown away like I thought I would be."
5,This is the book I wanted to write,"Red Dyed hair is the Greek version of the book I wanted to write. It is the story Kostas, the closet thinker who is forced by his mother-in-law to hold down a bureaucrat's job. He claims to want to quit his job to be an artist. In truth, he likes being a bureaucrat because it gives him an excuse not to produce.Louis is Kostas' free-wheeling friend who tries to tempt him to loosen up. We aren't sure if he is the devil, or a great liberator. But in the meantime, Louis clearly has a lot more fun, always getting the exotic girls; Kostas was always jealous. Perhaps most telling of Louis' charms, he was able to convert a die-hard Royalist taverna owner into a Communist, all the while sleeping with his wife.In the end, I suppose there is some sort of a moral. Louis, who never cared for his future, doesn't end up very well. But then again neither does Kostas."
3,Rocky relationship? Then you must see!,The movie was great in that it showed the three couple and how they all had their courtship struggles.It also explores the problems that people face with ex's and their current relationship. The trials and tribulation to love and rituals of many cultures and how we all are alike. Very insightfull but it was a little bit too long of a presentation.
2,Too hard for little hands,"Like some of the other reviews,I wasn't overly impressed with this product. The letters don't easily stick to the ""rods"". My kids to enjoy playing with these in the bath, but we can't use it for 'games' like we thought we would."
5,Fabulous if you're into advertising,"This is a must-read for anyone who is in or is thinking about going into advertising as a career. It gives a real inside look of the insanity of the big agencies and really the industry itself. Even though it was written a number of years ago, it's still very relevant. Technology may have changed, but people really haven't."
5,First-rate look at advertising the way it used to be done,"If you like Madmen you're going to love Femina's book. Even though this originally came out in 1970 the recent popularity of TV program makes this more relevent than ever. Written by an insider during the exciting decade of the 1960s this book has some amazing stories... and given the field of advertising they're all believable. More than a bunch of anecdotes, this book also talks about practical issues regarding advertising. Gasoline is all the same quality and pretty much all the same price... so how does someone differentiate between brands to the point where you'll go a couple of extra blocks just to pump one brand over another? When the rental rate is largely the same, how do you get people to use one car rental agency over another? Fascinating in many different ways."
2,Clearly over hyped,"I watched Jerry Della Femina's interview on Imus and his book sounded like a winner, you know, a precursor to the Mad Men series. What a disappointment. If Mad Men was this boring, I wouldn't watch the show. His writing style is matter of fact wisecracking with few names mentioned (to protect the guilty or absurd) and the supposed hijinx he describes are just not interesting. I have to admit I didn't finish the book and am just hoping I can get maybe 50 cents from it in our next garage sale!"
3,"It is called preserves, but no fruit is in this size.","Maybe these small jars could not hold pieces of apricot, but it still is delicious. I am devouring it anyway."
2,Compromise of Artistic Content,I agree with others who are unhappy with the decision to disregard the original aspect ratio of these cartoons.It was likely made by someone lacking an appreciation of the classic WB cartoons.Warner Brothers should consider recalling this disc and the Daffy Duck counterpart and re-releasing them in the correct aspect ratio.R Paradise
1,Butchered,Cropping off the top and bottom of a cartoon does NOT magically transform it into an acceptable widescreen presentation. It ruins it. This and the companion Daffy Duck volume are going back to Amazon ASAP.
1,"You realize, of course, this means...","...war. Cropped, letterboxed cartoons? For shame, Warner Bros., for shame.I will NOT buy until they are re-released in a manner suitable for display in the venue for which they were originally intended: A movie screen from the same era."
1,These Are Cropped !! Dont buy !!,These Are Cropped Amazon. Listen to complaints !!!Dont you see people are returning them left and right ?1?Change the format description !!
2,Cartoons CROPPED to look widescreen!,"Warner has done something here that they never did with the Golden Collection DVDs, they CROPPED the picture of the 1954+ cartoons to make them look widescreen. The animators at Warner Brothers NEVER animated for wide screen until the 1980 revival. There are jokes missing because they are in the upper or lower portions of the picture which are not there now. Maybe these were shown at the theaters this way, but I want to see them the way the animators intended us to see them.I have already contacted the powers that be at Warner Home Video to request a re-call and issue a proper un-cropped DVD of these classic cartoons.This would have NEVER happened in the Golden Collection sets. Someone who does not know better must be in charge now!This will be the LAST Looney Tunes DVD that I buy if this is going to be the new standard. Keep the old un-cropped Laserdiscs, a TRAVESTY has been committed here!1-800-553-6937 is the Warner Home Video customer service number."
1,"Cartoons cropped, customer not respected","As said before most of the cartoons of this set are cropped and tampered with. The top and bottom of the shorts have been cut to adapt them to widescreen format. This makes them unwatchable as bits of the action and animation are missing, the image looks cropped and you keep concentrating on the missing parts. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE viewing. Plus I must say the image restauration doesn't look as pristine as the Golden collection series.What is more unsettling is that Warner Bros keeps doing this all over again, tampering with content (censorship, cropping...) showing no respect at all for intellectual property but most of all no respect whatsoever for the customer. It is disgusting.Sadly I can't recommend the buying of this product and its sister : the Daffy Duck superstar. The viewing is really uncomfortable, and the fan and collector is not respected by Warner. The product is not worth the money it cost."
2,Wearisome...,"IN RESPONSE TO THE CONTENT:I'm forty-one. The Bugs cartoons that my friends and I loved best were the early Freleng, Avery, and Clampett ones - a few Jones and McKimson too - but not this super-late, flavorless junk. After sleep-overs we would groan Saturday mornings about this stuff and cheer when the early and funny ones came on. Often we could tell just by the opening whether it was time to change the channel for ten minutes or not.It's horribly tiresome that whenever Bugs appears on dvd in the last ten years the majority of the discs are crammed with this late material and not the work 1940-1947.I won't be purchasing this one but I hope Warners will collect the early best of America's favorite bunny on a future volume."
3,"Yup, they're cropped","I thought I'd take a chance and buy this disc in spite of the bad reviews because at least one reviewer said these were not cropped when he played them. I think his tv / dvd player must have squeezed them back to 4:3. They are all cropped to look wide screen. Bad show, WB :("
3,What's Up WB,I have all the Looney Tunes Golden collections and me and my family loves them all. What I did like about this collection is both the Bugs and Daffy cartoons weren't duplicated. There were some classic stuff I was looking for too and got it. The problem here was the cropping to widescreen. Tops of heads were cutoff and it makes me wonder who was the editor that ruined these collections. Did anyone checkout the finished product? I understand that the newer collections after these were made are in full screen and I hope the new Bugs and Daffy DVDs down the road follow the same coarse.
1,Let me know when they fix these egregious errors,"I'd like to buy these, but I will not until they are re-released without the cropping. As the artists originally intended? Seriously? They were ORIGINALLY done as INTENDED, alterations must have been done at the behest of someone's incompetent nephew who was awarded the job because he couldn't hold down a job at the car wash.When the Super Stars are released in the original format, without alteration, I will happily fork over the moolah for the entire collection. As it is, I must pass on this, though I am getting the Foghorn Leghorn collection because I hear it's OK."
3,Ups and downs of these two Super Stars,"I got this and the Daffy Duck DVD in the mail today. The advantage of both discs are that there are 15 new to DVD cartoons which is a big plus. However, like other folks who sent in their reviews I noticed how the cartoons were presented and this indeed did cause tons of controversy, I expect better. Hopefully if any more Super Stars DVD's come out (e.g. Foghorn Leghorn in November 2010) there won't be any issues."
3,More Bugs,"Cartoons older than 1953 were filmed in different aspects as to when they are put into widescreen, it will look a little odd. That is why Warner Bros used the fake widescreen matting. It is as simple as that. I have the majority of the shorts on other Looney Tunes releases, but they have a better video quality on this single disc than on the previous releases. These are cute cartoons for young kids to watch, but older fans probably already own these shorts. Overall, I enjoyed watching each one.The shorts on the single disc are:Mutiny on the BunnyBush HareHare We GoFoxy by ProxyHare TrimmedLumber Jack-RabbitNapoleon Bunny-PartBedevilled RabbitApes of WrathFrom Hare to HeirLighter than HareThe Million HareMad as a Mars HareDr. Devil and Mr. HareFalse Hare"
1,Item not as advertised,"Very disappointing collection of Bugs Bunny cartoons; was supposed to be collection of the best of Bugs Bunny, instead was one disc of forgettable cartoons and one disc of the evolution of Bugs Bunny; nothing on these discs was what i expected. I am returning this product."
2,A poor showing.,"Hart tries hard, but his Sanskrit method is poorly written and edited, not to mention poorly printed. In the section on pronunciation, he never even mentions where the stress goes in a word! If you're looking for a Sanskrit textbook, try Michael Coulson'sTeach Yourself Sanskrit, which is much more comprehensive and better presented. It also contains an excellent explanation of the Sanskrit exegetical tradition and Pan''''inian grammar."
3,great film,"Having watched this film, and being a psychology major, and having depression myself, I am reviewing this from a particular perspective. That being said, overall, I believe this is a great documentary to watch for those who have depression, or may think they do and are not sure. This is a mental health condition that has been hard for men to open up with and to deal with, for cultural reasons etc. This film allows the male viewer to see that they are not alone, and that there is nothing wrong with expressing ones emotions and seeking help. This film was long over due and it is a great progress that it has been made and that us men are being allowed by society to be human beings and to have feelings like everyone else."
2,Don't rely on this study guide,"This text was only helpful in that it presented topics that could then be researched using reliable sources. The study questions were extremely redundant, often with contradictory answers. In some cases, the text copied content directly from a public source (like Medicaid information) but then misinterpreted the information in the question and answer section. I found that some of the study guide ""answers"" were obviously incorrect when compared to the ""gold standard"" sources of information. Some topics that were emphasized by this study guide were never covered on the exam, while the exam included questions that were not addressed in the study guide."
3,Boring,"I hate to be critical, but I couldn't finish this video, it's slow and her accent is heavy. Probably good content though."
2,colors look faded,"Center stone looks yellow, pink stones look faded, colors are not as shown in picture. stones do have a nice shine to them even though the colors look faded"
2,fun for kids..,"This game is for 7+ years, it says violence on the box, but there really is none. It's basically like a board game, with one or 2 players. The graphics are okay.. and it has a couple of fun mini games on the board. The only one I hate is the one where you have to play a dinosaur and fight another player. This game pops up way too much on the screen and gets really boring after a while. Other then that you get to match dinosaur bones, retrieve things and shoot dinosaurs to get their DNA, since the lab was destroyed and the scientists need more. So I think it's a fun game.. except that one mini game where you fight a dinosaur one on one with another player or a computer player pops up WAY too much.. and I just think that part is really stupid because none of the other games pop up that much, and the other ones are funner."
5,Cool Game,"Awesome graphics and lots of mini-games. Me and my friends love to play this game together. Herding Raptors, sneaking past the TRex in T-Rex Extreme and Raging Raptors are my favorites. The dinos, especially the T-Rex and Raptors, are just like the movie."
5,Danger Zone RULES!,This is one of the coolest games you will ever play. It's like a board game but everywhere you land there's a different game. Lots of the games are freak out scary like the movie. You have to fix a fence before a raptor catches up and kills you! You have to sneak past a T-rex and if you don't make it you get eaten alive! The dinosaurs are totally realistic. And the dueling dinosaurs game RULES!
4,I love this game!!,"I know this game is geared towards younger people, but as a 35 year old working woman I find it great to play a game where I can get lost in the action. I can play this game for hours! I like to play two dino defenders at a time because it seems like a lot more fun. This is a great game, I hope everyone who plays it has a good time as I do when I play."
5,Great game,"I thought that this game was great. It had some of the best graphics that I've seen. The basic idea of the game is also very good, as it also goes along with Dino Defender. Both Games are very good."
5,Pleasures Of The Fifties,"Somethin' Smith & The Redheads were really popular in the mid to late fifties. Every selection is a razzle dazzle sing along song fest from the Pop Fifties. It's a wonderful experience to hear once again.Somthin' Smith was a Norfolk, Virginia boy, who had an interest in music early in his life. He studied the banjo as a child. During his four year stint in the Navy he played in Navy bands and orchestras. And later became an Arthur Godfrey Talent Scouts Winner. He later formed Somthin' Smith and The Redheads with cohorts Saul Striks and Major Short while attending UCLA.This release features some really well produced tunes from two of the groups best EPIC issues. ""Shanty In Old Shanty Town"" is excellent. ""Put The Blame On Mame"" is fabulous. In fact, it's very refreshing to hear this kind of ""POP"" music once again.This is a classic from some very talented fellows."
5,Robbo,"This is an amazing production... crammed full of great tips from page 1!Very well written, easy to understand, and each tip is empty of geek stuff.I love it."
2,Background / Interview CD,"One point that's not made here is that this is a story of / interview CD, with no new song material or so forth. As background / interview things go, it's fine --- but it's no more than that. Originated in England, where the WS first found a listening space.(Follow-up: the title has been changed - thanks whoever!)"
1,Very cheap and flimsy.,This flag is very cheap in construction. Flag itself is very thin and could never be used on a moving vehicle as it would surely shred very quickly. The field of my flag also has a stain on it.
1,Not reliable,"This is not a reliable product. It is a car flag and should hold up while driving, at least until it becomes old and ratty. The first time it was used, however, it broke. That should not happen the first time a car flag is used. I do not advise buying this product."
5,Brazilian Metal,"When I first listened to that band I heard that they were white metal. Ok, they are in deed, but the what those guys do, there is no word to describe. I think the song ""Mother Land"" is one of the best metal song that I ever listen to. I hope they can make such a great success just like Shaman and Angra around the world. Listen, buy this compact fellas. It worths it a lot!"
5,Just wonderful!,"Searching the net for dogs in cartoons and comics, I stumbled on Fergus and Mel - and fell in love with them immediately. So I rushed to Amazon and bought the 3 ""Citizen Dog"" available books, and boy -- what a joy!Fergus and company do entertain, with clever writing and appealing characters. Mel *is* dog's best friend; he and pal Fergus always are having fun together, like two children in a toy store. At the same time, they have their fights with each other. All in all, it always make you smile.And although being a dog person, I cannot help from saying that Cuddles (AKA Claws, the culturally ambiguous cat) has become one of my favorite comic characters ever. Maybe because he is a little bit naive, and not so egoistical and mean like cats use to be... (sorry for that!). I also like Arlo and Bruno.Forgot Snoopy and Garfield, folks; it's ""Citizen Dog"" time now. Way to go, Mark O'Hare!"
4,the Donnas cut short?,"I love the Donnas, and I love this album. But the last track on the CD side is only 53 seconds and just cut-off in the middle of the song. Did this happen to anyone else?"
2,amateurish,"It always strikes me that most memoirs about the adoption process feature the struggles of people who entered into the process blindly, innocently, and naively then were amazed at the difficulties they encountered. This book is no exception to the pattern. What is surprising is that the author seems to have had a good outcome despite her near ignorance of what she was doing.She has a compelling story to tell. Unfortunately, her choice of writing the book as a journal leads to alot of repetition of thoughts and emotions. No doubt she experienced them every day, but reading the same brief description many times over is not as interesting as if she described the thought process just once in detail (ex: giving thanks to her sister almost every day). The book ends quite abruptly, without any closure.Having just adopted 2 toddlers from Russia last year, I was looking forward to reading someone else's journey. I was left quite dissappointed, however."
4,I've never forgotten it...,"I read this book a good ten years ago and I have never forgotten it. I had just finished my first year at college as well. I just read another book, a coming of age novel, that reminded of it and I wanted to put a good word in for Mr. Kennedy's book. I've never forgotten the feelings and insights it gave me. I think of it often."
2,Doesn't Compare,"I have the ""Idiot's Guide to Chess"" too. Chess For Dummies is not nearly as well organized and is very unclear compared to the ""idiots's Guide to Chess"". Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Disorganized and broken learning style,It does not take you through a well arranged series of lessons like I had expected.There is so much stuff in it that doesnot have any thing to do with learning chess mixed in with some good learning stuff.There should have been a focus on just instructional things.
2,Will not teach you chess so what's the point?,"Sure this book will teach you chess etiquette, how the pieces move, some famous chess players name and other such rubbish but very little will actually focus on strategy, tactics, and essentially how to win. I do not recommend this to anyone besides those who have never ever played before. It simply is worthless to those who have the basics down."
3,"Bad explanation, but its recommended books are awesome.","This book's reccommended books are very good. It recommends Chess endings essential knowledge, Art of attack in chess, modern chess strategy, etc. Other then that, the book was dull and unpolished. I am a 1200 rated player and want better books such as chess endings essential knowledge wich changed my life,"
1,Confusing as all get out!,I tried to learn chess from Chess For Dummies. It was not written so even a dummy could understand things. It starts showing you stuff about how to play chess then suddenly you find a chapter in between that has nothing to do with what was covered before and leaves you lost and confused. How can a book like this be popular? Maybe because it is just part of a series of hundred of books that cover other subjects but just this one is aweful because the company did not know any better when putting it together.
4,Better than the reviews make out,"Some of the reviews on this book do seem a bit biased. It is a perfectly reasonable guide, and better than some other beginner books. Along with the under-rated CHESS TRAINING FOR BUDDING CHAMPIONS, it is one of my favorites."
2,Flip flops and confusing at times,"If you are a beginner or advanced beginner who wants to learn to play from a book then avoid this book. I found that this book is not organized every well because it has too many things out of order and sometimes doesn't explain things very good.It does have a lot of things in it. It is just the way it is set up and the way it tells things. Maybe if you are an adult you can understand it better, but then get a better book anyway."
1,"Not well organized, confusing and jumps all around!!!","You will find that this book will be very confusing for someone just starting out in chess. It is one of the worst of the Dummy Series ever written. This series can have some good stuff for the beginner in other fields, but this book is not suitable for anyone of any age to learn from. Chapters jump around and there was no lesson plan devised.[...]"
4,Clear and Comprehensive,"This is a very good introduction to chess. However, it is good for someone who knows a little bit chess. It covers most of the topics and it is very easy to understand.I want to use this to make a correction:on page 96 it is mentioned that the black is forced to lose. But that is not true:King moves: d8->c7->b8 : no checkmate simplyagain on page 100 it is stated that Black was forced to checkmate. It is not true. Black could simply capture the white rook with its knight and White would have not been able to checkmate.on page 106, white can get better advantage by moving its bishop to f7 before moving its queen. although for illustration, it does not matter.on page 135 black can escape checkmate by loss of material: bishop takes white knight on g5. then F7 black pawn moves ahead"
2,Very hard to understand,I found that this book was very hard to understand when I was first learning how to play. I saw it on here on amazon.com and said I must tell about it.This is a nice thick book and tells you a lot about things other than sticking to how to learn chess. I found this to be very confusing because in one chapter I was learning some things and then it would go off in other directions and not stick to teaching chess.
1,A poorly written book,"This book is very poorly written. If it wasnnot under the reputation of being under the ""dummy"" series it would not even appear near the top of the list of chess books. This shows how a series of books other than chess can make a book sell so well.The problems with this book are many. I am 12 and an read ok. But I know that this book does not cover the basics of chess very well since getting it a couple of years ago and reading more advanced books and playing in touraments. It is a good thing I also got some other books on playing chess and learned from some people. This is because this book leaves out so many important things that a beginner needs to know and covers some advertizing type of stuff to promote other chess things. I didn't realize that until recently that this book doesn't know how to really teach someone how to play from the beginning. So I decided to write this now that I am a good player."
3,"Good for beginners, but that's it.","This book is good for the absolute beginner. Someone who doesn't even know how the pieces move. There are several chapters dedicated to how the pieces are allowed to move. There are no good chapters on Chess strategy. If you want the basics AND strategy, check out the book ""The Complete Idiots Guide to Chess"". It's much better overall. One great thing about this book: you don't need a chess set to follow along, nor do you need to know any sort of chess notation. Every lesson has diagrams so you can follow the lessons with JUST THE BOOK! I'm at the point in my chess career where I'm reading higher-level books, but I still reread this one in spare time occasionally. I also lend it to people who *might* be interested, or people who know the moves, but don't know how to implement them. This book is good because you can get through it in a few days, and be better off for it. Just realize that it is aimed at beginners and you won't go wrong with it."
1,Not a good chess book,"362 pages of what!?? I wonder...If you really dont know how to play chess any chess set you buy, like at wal-mart, will have instructions on how to move the pieces. For places to play online I recomend you do a search online and you will find sites like yahoo chess and ICC which are both popular forums. That about takes care of the 362 pages of chess for dummies.If you are serious about improving your chess there are far better books for beginners. I would recomend books like Winning Chess (volumes) by Seirawan and How to reasses your chess. Trust me, this book will do little more than teach you to move the pieces."
2,Not Comprehensive,"This book looks like a nice thick book when you first see it. It has a lot of pages. What is so disapointing is that it does a terrible job of providing a logical progression of well thought out lessons to help the beginner build a solid knowledge of chess. It is confusing as it skips around, often covering things totally unrelated to what a beginner needs to know. I agree with the other reviewers that the ""Idiot's Guide to Chess"" is superior (and ""Chess For Juniors"" for kids is just great)."
1,Yukky!,"My father has a nice collection of chess books with 3 books for the beginner. I rate this one at the very bottom. It spends too much time with badly broken up chapters that make no since to the order they are placed in. It also seems to promote things other than teaching chess to a beginner. It may look thick but only about half the book is really teaching you good things about basic things. YOU WOULD BE A DUMMY TO BUY IT.The two other books are much better. THE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO CHESS, is not perfect but much better. You will get twice as much material that teaches you in it. CHESS FOR JUNIORS is my favorite because it is just packed with pure lessons with what you need to know the most and is part of a series that allows you to buy more books that continue to take you way far beyond just the basics.The Dummy Series is overall not bad, but this book stinks!"
2,A Well Written Book With Limited Information On Chess,"I had not picked up a chess piece for more than ten (10) years so I was looking forward to reading this book as a ""refresher course"" in chess. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.While a very well written book (a rarity in chess literature) the information is confusingly presented and not nearly has helpful as ""The Idiot's Complete Guide To Chess.""My wife is a complete novice and she began reading this work so we could play chess together. She became so confused that she gave up reading this text in frustration. Therefore, I warn chess beginners that this book may not be the expected panacea.This work does have an excellant discussion of chess terms and a history of the top chess players with a list of these players best games.My apologies to you people who loved this book, but unfortunately I was very underwhelmed by this work."
2,A SOLID TWO!,"There is no way I can even begin to give this book a higher rating than a tWO (maybe a one, but I am generous here). I own numerous other of the ""Dummy Book Series"" and have been rather satisfied. However, this book, though not terrible, seems to lose the reader by often not have a logical progression of material, not making things clear and containing a lot of ""junk"" material that has little to do with actually learning the basics of chess. [...]"
3,"Useful information, but mediocre presentation","There is a good deal of useful chess information in this book, but the presentation of the material is unsystematic. A good editor should have organized the material better. The book has a slapdash style that will probably confuse the absolute beginner (""the dummy"") more than is necessary. A better book for a beginner, in my opinion, is Yasser Seirawan's _Play Winning Chess_ which introduces most of that material covered here, but in a systematic way that builds a more solid foundation for further development in chess."
2,Two Better Beginner's Books Available,"I have seen this and several other books that are beginner's books.This book spends a lot of time time covering things that don't teach you anything, like addresses and where to go elswhere. I suggest that. Look at either IDIOT'S GUIDE TO CHESS (excellent for adults) or CHESS FOR JUNIORS (excellent for adults or even more so for kids)."
4,Very good introduction to chess,"""Chess for Dummies"" provides a very good introduction to the game of chess. If you've never played chess, or haven't played since childhood, you will get a quick refresher in the first few chapters of the book. Subsequent chapters provide a good foundation in strategy and tactics. There is also a smattering of chess lore and history throughout the book. For myself, this is about all I need to be able to enjoy an occasional game with friends."
1,My First Book On Chess - Almost Made Me Quit,"I was first introduced to chess by a friend. It was great! I then went down and picked up a copy of this book, since it was part of the famous ""dummy series"" and after reading about half of it was about to give up wanting to learn chess. Gosh, just because other books are known for being good, I soon realized who ever hired this ""dummy"" to write this book should be fired. The book is in VERY short segments. One segment doesn't build much on a former segment. And, the book seems to promote various things having little to do with teaching you good quality basics.Buy this book and then see what I mean."
5,Breathtaking score for a phenominal movie,Phillip Glass provides yet another oscar-worthy score here with The Hours. I truly believe it is the best score since Requiem For A Dream. Nothing could have fit the film better than the haunting piano solos found on this cd. A MUST for any fan of The Hours.
1,Extroardinarily Depressing,"K. Alease White's second novel, ""Born of Evil Born to Woe"", certainly lives up to its name. While her writing and characterization has improved since the first novel in the series (""The Jewel of Tamar""), the tale is so tragic and heart wrenching that you'll wish you had never read it; everything good and happy found in the first novel is cruelly stripped away. I had hoped that this book would focus more on the dynamics between Tsujataha and Sillara, but instead, it wound the reader through seperate paths of misfortune and heartbreak. If you were a fan of her BGII mod, this book will ruin it for you (and does not fit with that timeline, regardless). If you were a fan of her first book, and are hoping for a happy ending, you will not find it. In sum, the high cost, amaturish writting, and utterly depressing story makes this novel one that you can easily pass over."
4,better than the first,"I've read them both, ""The Jewel of Tamar"" and ""Born of Evil, Born to Woe,"" and though the first one is good, the second one is much better. ""Born of Evil"" is the conclusion of the epic tale of Sillara and Tsujatha. You'll be surprised at what happens! Don't wait to dive back into the rich world of Gilalion."
3,"An ""unknown"" historical organ",Who likes sound of historical organs will enjoy this recording. But notes about the place of recording and name of organ builder are lacking. I am very dissatisfied with lack of this important information.
1,Think thats what ya get when its not made in USA,"I have been to all the local hardware outlet stores and looked online and Ive yet to find a good belt that fits my 44 ish waist.Sure it reads it goes to 48"" waist yet I take it out of the package and I cant even get the tip to touch the buckle and I am wearing size 44 pants. I see I am not the only one frustraited with this. Ive sent letters to some stores expressing my frustraitions. Many belts come in four differant sizes yet they only order the smaller sizes for the most part. I finaly went to sears and bought a semi dress belt, hmmmm says size 48 and i got several inches to work with. Good luck big fellas, its a cruel world out there for us bigger carpenters. Geeze maybe thats why ol Norm uses a cheepy work belt, he cant find any of the better belts to fit him either."
1,Must be METRIC,"Whoever measured this belt should not EVER attempt to build anything! This belt IS NOT 47""-55"", more likely, 37""-45"". Perhaps it's just mis-marked but I won't waste anymore time finding out."
1,I hate it,"Another very fattening group of recipes....not to my liking, loaded with fats and very heavy. I will not recommend this product."
5,a must have cookbook for summer time,"These recipes are straightforward, creative and absolutely delicious. This is the cookbook I grab all summer long when I want to eat very well and don't want to have to fuss. And, even though this book is many years old, the receipes are still fresh and inventive."
3,The sloweest seller in the world!!!,"I needed the book in two weeks time, but for whatever reason I recieved it a month later. How convenient?"
2,There are better textbooks...,"I have found myself wanting to throw this book out my window on several occasions because the examples are so inaccessible for most of the book, and the chapter on observing language change is laughable, at best. If you're taking a Historical Linguistics class, pray your instructor is using a different book, or do yourself a favor and buy Lyle Campbell's book as a supplement; it's much more clear, and the examples are not derived from a bunch of Polynesian languages. It helps if you have some familiarity with the languages used to illustrate the change or theory at hand, and this text falls very much short of that, which seems like a pedagogical misstep."
2,Cheaply made,These are poorly made. Mine lasted a couple years and fell apart. They never worked right in the first place.I now have to buy another pair. I'll get something of a better quality this time.
1,Low quality tools,"I've used a few different Fiskars garden tools, and they do not stay sharp for very long at all. Not worth it. Spend more on Felco brand and get quality that lasts for many years."
5,Strong Shears!,"These pruning shears are the only ones you'll ever need. They are so strong, so fantastic, work on all plants and palms and small trees. Highly recommend these for all gardeners and home owners!"
2,Not as Described,The 9109 is described as being Made in the USA. The ones I received were made in China. They are going back.
3,you get what you pay for,"I have owned these shears for two years. The first year they were okay - they were a little stiff in unlock them, but they did cut. I alternated with an older pair of shears for my gardening needs. This year the cheap vinyl covering on one of the handles came loose and there was a big hole at one end. Now this covering will not stay in place when using the shears. I guess this what happens you buy cheap material to make your product."
5,Outstanding customer service!,"The spring in this pruner broke after quite a bit of use; I don't recall when we purchased it. I emailed Fiskars asking for a replacement spring. Within a week an entirely new tool arrived in my mailbox!When they say ""lifetime guarantee"", this company really means it! Outstanding customer service!"
3,Good shears but there are better,"These shears a robust and for pruning. They are not for cutting your flowers or anything else. Instead they're heavy duty and made to cut branches.Good: Heavy, sturdy, will cut fairly thick branches (I've cut half inch thick bamboo with no problems)Bad: Does not have a ""stop"", some other shears will let you cut the branch halfway off and keeps the ends locked around the branch. These don't."
3,Average shears,"The blades are sharp, the capacity is good, but the handle covers have a way of sliding off the handles in frequent use."
4,Good for Light Duty Cutting,"These work fine on green wood up to 1/2"" in diameter, but anything larger needs more leverage. The lock is easy to use and very accessable, making one hand operations a breeze. The best thing about these is that they'll fit in your back pocket and stay locked. I also have a ratcheting, anvil style clipper that works much better on slightly larger twigs with much less effort."
2,Not The FISKARS You Expect,"Not what I expected...FISKARS are supposed to be high quality stainless made in Finland. These are ordinary steel, ordinary pruners, made in the USA for Fiskars. I returned them. Fiskars Garden Shears Model 9637 are the real thing. But now that these pruners are reduced in price, as long as you know what you are getting, they aren't a bad buy."
5,Eye Opening Experience,"I absolutely loved this book. If you work around people or have to interact with people, then this book is a must read and a must understand."
1,Rehashing old ideas,"""This was required reading in a group I belong to. Quite frankly, this is the first book in a long time, that I thought... OMG what a waste of paper! The author uses old personality selection methods, with no significant credentials in this field. It's cliche at best, and points to manipulation of people by knowing their weakest points. A waste of $10."""
5,Excellent self help!,"This book is a tremendous help in working with business associates, church associates, volunteer groups and family. You will learn why some people are drawn to you and why others seem to be offended by you. There's good information on how to build on your strengths and minimize your weaknesses. Easy to read - lots of humor."
2,Fine Watch. Lousy wrist strap....,I purchased this watch new from Amazon in November 2008. It's a fine watch but after a year the siding on the wrist strap started coming off. The watch and band are now pretty unattractive. The Omega repair facility informed me that their normal 2 year warranty was not good on watches purchased from Amazon/or over the internet. Pretty disappointing. So what's up with this Amazon?
2,Not the Hammer Holster in the Picture,"I currently own a hammer Holder like the one shown in this picture, (hinges that fold inwards) and I love it. My friend who is a contractor has commented on mine a few times in the past on how he would like one. So as a little gift I looked for one on Amazon and found just the one I was looking for, or so I thought. The hammer holder I received was not like the one in the picture. It had a solid metal bar with no hinges. I'm sure its a good holder but not the one I wanted. I will be sending it back and doing a little more research before ordering again."
2,Elementary Book on Bonds,"While The Money Making Guide to Bonds is well written, it is designed for the novice. For example, the book has a very general discussion of duration with no mathematics. Moreover, convexity is not discussed at all. The authors are enthusiastic about bonds but do not give enough attention to the inflation risk of owning bonds."
3,Well built but inconsistent,This spreader is well built and the large drive wheels make it a breeze to push. The only disappointment I have is the inconsistent pattern of the spreading. I expected better.
4,Does the job,"Did not get the 5 stars because:-the assembly instructions were not straightforward.-there is no mechanism that automatically shuts the opening when you stop: the material keeps falling on the ground, especially when spreading heavily (e.g. lime) unless you close the opening yourself before you stop.-this spreader is not listed in the packages of what you need to spread, so it takes trial and error to figure out the right opening for the appropriate rate."
2,Assembly is ridiculously difficult,"I am mechanically inclined and yet it still took me a full two hours to assemble this product. That is longer than it has taken me to assemble any other consumer product and it is, IMHO, unconscionable for a $160 spreader. The instructions are extremely poor, the process gratuitously difficult and you need to provide your own tools. Once fully assembled, it appears to be a decent spreader but don't even think about buying this product if you are not prepared for a long and frustrating assembly process.I will say that Amazon had the best price I could find and the product arrived quickly."
5,"Spend a few more dollars on this one, it's worth it!","The less expensive spreaders are very tempting to buy especially when you consider how often you actually use them, but in the end, you'll be much happier you went with this one! It's a rugidly built spreader and the larger tires seem to smooth out the rougher areas in my yard. The adjustable height handle easily allows you to get it to a comfortable position. It does require some time to assemble but not a big deal in my opinion! The one thing I would do to make it better would be to replace the hex nuts on the flow adjustment rod with nylock style, self-locking nuts instead. The hex nuts by themselves tend to loosen up over time which requires stopping and re-adjusting (kind of a pain)! I'm sure it will last me many years and probably be the last spreader I'll need to buy!"
4,"Works great, quality of parts is questionable","I borrowed my neighbor's Earthway 2150 spreader and after using it I knew I had to have one too. It spread my fertilizer very easily even though my yard is anything but level or smooth. I ordered one immediately. The difference between the Earthway and my current Scotts SpeedyGreen SG-3 rotary spreader , I think, is due to the larger size of tires and considerably longer handle. However, upon looking at the parts of my Earthway 2150, I did notice that the quality isn't what I was expecting. For example, the axle is not solid, but is hollow; the wheels are not metal, but are plastic; the gearbox doesn't feel solid, but very light; and the cross brace is also hollow. So while I'm not impressed with the quality of the parts, I have to remember I was impressed with the function of the spreader which is why I ordered one in the first place. Only time will tell if the product is actually worth the money; I am very hopeful."
5,2150 EARTHWAY BROADCAST SPREADER,"THIS IS A FIRST CLASS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT FOR YARD WORK AND IT IS BUILT TO LAST. I USED IT THIS WEEK, AND THE SPREADING WAS UNIFORM ACROSS THE YARD. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SPREADER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WANTS TO MAINTAIN A GREAT YARD.BOB G NORTH CAROLINA"
5,Everything I had hoped for,"I'm not sure what all of the complaints were about how long this spreader takes to put together, but i had it completed in about 45 minutes. The directions were easily understandable and it went together like a charm. This spreader is much better than the last two Shindawa commercial spreaders that i owned. The 50-pound capacity is perfect because if you get any more product than that in a push spreader it makes it very difficult to push. I would highly recommmend this spreader."
4,So Far So Good,"I had done a lot of research on spreaders for my 1 acre lawn. I wanted something that would last a while and that could handle heavy use and hilly terrain. Large pneumatic tires, a positive force chute opening and closing mechanism (not a cable inside of a rubber housing), and something tall enough for my 6'3"" frame were all important to me. It's still winter so I have not used it yet, but so far it looks as thought the Earthway 2150 will fit the bill.Shipping was extra fast. Received the contents snugly packed in a nice small box (small compared to the assembled size of the spreader). Took about an hour to assemble. This thing is a monster. Solidly built. My one gripe is that I wish the hopper was a bit bigger. For such a big frame, it seems as though this spreader could have handled an 80 lb hopper quite easily. Oh well. I'm pretty sure it can handle a bag of Milorganite or a 10,000 sq ft bag of fertilizer at a time."
4,OK spreader for the money,This spreader is by far better than any other spreader I've ever used. They advertise it as a commercial spreader and I was a little disappointed that it was not better than it is. But it is OK. It took me about 45 minutes to put it together. It is easy to push on hills and handles a 50 pound bag of fertilizer with no problems. Unless you want to spend $400 I don't think you will find a better spreader.
2,Durability Questionable,"I purchased my 2150 spreader last fall and used it once to spread pelletized fall fertilizer on my half acre lawn, washed it out immediately afterwards and then stored it insisde my garage over the winter. I used it again in early April to spread pelletized lime, washed it again and stored it indoors. Two weeks later I used it to spread spring pelletized fertilizer only to have the gearbox completely jam-up on me. Beware of the 90 day warranty, I guess!"
5,Another Book Soon,Wonderful light reading. The author's use of her own family experiences brings a downhome feel to the book. Made me want to visit Tuscany some day. Looking forward to seeing another book published soon.
4,Nice little EP,"While The Lovemakers still bring plenty of electric dance energy to the songs on this album there is more rock infused into this release (Save Me is half rock jam).The winners are the title track and We Already Said Goodbye with Natually Lonely (a lovely ballad) just behind. They are also the best videos as well (there is a video for all five songs on the disk).I would rate higher but it boils down to only 3 good songs, well three GOOD songs, really. Fans sould love, but new listeners sould get the excellent Times Of Romance album to start."
2,Only 5 Songs?,"I am disappointed that I paid $11 for 5 songs, of which only 3 are good. I don't care that there are videos on the CD, and they are on the The Lovemaker's myspace site and YouTube to be viewed for free anyway. I saw this album was out and bought it blindly because I loved ""Times of Romance"" so much, but I guess I shouldn't have been so trusting. However, I must say the 3 songs I like on here are really good."
2,Tides,"Good quality video, but very short and doesn't have continuos loop option available in main menu so we have to keep restarting it....over, and over...and over."
1,Horrible for heavy use,"i bought a set from the local auto store and they lasted me less than a month at work, i am at 3 days shy of a month on these gloves and my thumb index and middle fingers on both hands are torn through, and my left ring finger is almost there as well, i bought these in hopes they would be a step up from the cheap 4 dollar ones that only lasted a month and these were actually worse! i am a tire installer and i put in 40 hours of nothing but gloves and these just do not hold up! i will say if your doing light work they may be great as they are comfortable and easy on and off, as well as you can work with the smallest of items and not lose your ability to handle!"
4,different then original but still good,These are thicker than the original ones I had but I still love them. I am not sure if I am really brand loyal to these but I do use them regularly. They are thick enough to keep my hands warm while I still maintain agility to do the things I want to be able to do with gloves on. The fit is good and they have lasted really really well. I use them a lot and they continue to hold together.
4,Nice Lite Glove...,Nice tight fit! Great quality but material seems thin. I Probably should have gone with the originals but can't beat the price...
5,A must for mechanics,"I purchased 2 pairs of this glove for my 2 sons. When working in the cold on their cars, their hands would be so cold and they couldn't grip things well. They are both pleased with the gloves. They don't seem to be too thick. I think the sizing is correct also."
4,Glove Review,My brother liked these gloves so much that he requested a second pair. Buying them online from Amazon.Com was a better bargain than shopping in town. Thanks so much.
4,Great for around the house work,"My wife and I use these Mechanix gloves whenever she helps me out around the house. They're thin enough to be able to pick up small screws while they're still on, but provide enough protection so you don't rub your skin raw while tackling fix it projects. One drawback is that they aren't very comfortable once they get wet, so leave them behind when doing any sort of plumbing work."
2,Very LIGHT duty only.,"It seems as if these gloves just aren't made the way they used to be. I should have noticed that many of the positive reviews for these gloves were written way before I purchased a pair. After having gone through 2 pairs in the span of a few months, I can safely say I will be staying away from these and other Mechanix gloves in the future.Not everything is bad. They fit and feel great when new. The problem is their durability, or lack there of. The material of the palm and fingers is very thin and will develop holes if used for anything other than light duty house keeping. I used mine for various gardening and DIY projects, none of which were extensively abusive, and I rapidly wore holes by the fingertips."
4,Working Gloves,"Very handy to have around if you have to change a tire, shocks, or anything relatively dry.Are soiled easily when dealing with moisture, oil, gas, etc, and becomes a bit unpleasant to use."
3,Very Light Duty,"I recently began working a seasonal part-time job with Coca-Cola and bought these to handle the boxes, bottles & cradles. The gloves didn't last, by the end of week one they looked like hobo gloves. I had a pair of Craftsman light-to-mid duty gloves that lasted for over a year of moderate punishment before they tore up and found *CLC gloves that are identical (other than color & strap) to the afore-mentioned Craftsman mitts. On the plus-side, these are comfortable, machine washable, dexterous and carry asthetic. Mechanix Utility might be great for gardening or tactical/law enforcement use but any kind of light, repetitive friction or strain & they're toast. For $11-$12.00 there are other, much more durable gloves available that don't sacrifice a-lot of dexterity.*http://www.amazon.com/Custom-Leathercraft-125M-Handyman-Gloves/dp/B0002YPZKY/ref=pd_cp_hi_1** Updated: The glove sold & pictured now is a newer version than the one reviewed here."
5,Good glove for the price,I use this glove for occasional work on my car and around the house (especially wiring) and it works perfectly fine.
1,crap,"soooooooooooooooooooooooo cheap, soooooooooooooooo thin, so cruddy compared to the last pair of this brand. I would highly recommend not buying these, unless it is for driving a prius or something"
3,useful but not very comfortable,"useful but not very comfortable, very safe and protects the hand but is not as easy to put on and remove, is a good article for use at home or work"
5,My Go To For Everything,"These are my favorite gloves and 2nd of this brand, model. They've improved the model slightly but retained the over all feel and build. I use for work out, range, work, repair. Thin enough for small things but provides the protection your looking for."
3,ok,They rip in palm after 3 weeks of use. Not very happy with them need more strenthg in palm area would not reccomend
4,These are great!,"I never work without them anymore, and this is a great price compared to stores. I now have two pairs that I alternate clean-ish and dirty/ready for washing."
2,fit is loose,"Gloves fit very loose, they do not have velcro tab to tighten the wrist. Not heavy duty, very lite duty. Do not recommend."
3,"Good content, not the greatest quality...","CD has great content as far as the songs which are on it. However, some of the songs have feedback in them, but definetly a CD to have."
1,Doesnt even rate a star but have to put 1 because this things makes me,"I love the 2 reviews by the guys below me. They are so on the money about these (unts. Speaking of money, isnt it funny how retards like 50 Cent and the knew SOLD OUT Snoop Dogg perform for the dollar than for the art. Im surprised no one has shot Snoop yet as he is as big a sell out as any of these other pop-rappers. Money I spose means so much to these guys to be targetting little 13 year old wanna be gangstas. Id hate to see what pop music will be like when I have my own kids. Im a bass player and take pride in my creativity and although yes I will never be a star nor rich through music realizing Snoop and 50 Cent are 2 of the biggest guns in pop music these days, Im proud to say this is because my music is just way to mature for the music market."
1,Interviews about prison violence,"I'll start my review by stating that this film was a disappointment for me. The film is marketed in some other Internet sites as an educational film on knife attacks in prison, and how to counter them. In reality, this film is comprised mainly of interviews of ex convicts and former correctional officers who worked in Rikers Island prison. There are some photographs of stabbing victims and some authentic camera footage, but about 90% of the film consists of interviews.The film concentrates on prison violence and corruption in the late 80's and early 90's. I did not find the subject interesting or topical issue. Anybody knows that there is violence among the prisoners, and anyone can claim that the correctional officers are corrupt. And in any case, the cases handled in the film happened over a decade ago.Some people might find these interviews interesting, but I did not learn anything of value or of interest from this film.Run time: 0:43"
3,Good value for the price,"This vac is good for a quick clean up on hard surfaces. It does not have the greatest power, but is small and lightweight. Will get clogged up with lots of dog hair. Lasts a couple of years and then - toss it. Good price."
4,Great for dorm room,This works great for my dorm room. The suction is good but not amazing. It does what it is supposed to do.
3,Good for a quick-clean,"When I first bought this I thought that it would be ideal for my 1200 sqft apartment. This picks up well on tiles, and is a good prewash procedure; however it only sucks up surface dirt on the carpets. For me, it's perfect for keeping the tiles clean around the litter box area, but I would NOT recommend it as your primary vacuum."
4,Love It!,This vacuum has a great suction. It gets the messes and is easy to clean. You can use as a vacuum or a hand held vacuum. It's just difficult getting hair up.
4,Better Than Expected !!,"I GOT THIS BASED ON THE REVIEWS AND FOR A LIGHTWEIGHT PICK UP !! IT CAME VIA AMAZON SUPER FAST--- 2 DAYS !! I SET IT UP IN A PINCH, RAN IT OVER VERY LITE PILE CARPET AND IT PICKED UP THE CRUMBS ETC.. GREAT ON THE HARDWOOD TOO. POWERFUL ENOUGH AND GOOD FOR STORAGE SPACE. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS EXCEPT THE HANDLE COULD BE LONGER. I WAS GOING BACK & FORTH WITH THIS AND THE BISSEL FEATHERWEIGHT, AND I SHOULD HAVE READ THE SPECS ON THE HEIGHT. OTHERWISE, GOOD PRICE AND IT GETS THE JOB DONE !!"
3,A little diaspointed,"I received it quickly in the mail, however, to me, it does not pick up well on carpet. It leaves pieces of string, etc. I tried going over and over and it just would not pick up.It worked okay on the bare floor. The cord is too short. I would have to do one side of the room and then un-plug and re-plug on the other side of the room."
2,Weakling,"Sure, its cheap. Sure, its light..... but come on, the suction is so weak!!!! I guess if you deliberately spilled a some sand on hardwood floor, it would suck the sand up. but if you spilled anything in the carpet... you are better off using a piece of duct tape..."
2,Short cord... horrible on carpet.,"I read ALOT of reviews before purchasing this little vacuum. It got great reviews and I'm not entirely sure why. First of all, its not cordless, now I don't know why I thought it was, but I definitely was not expecting to be held back by a cord. I live in a small apartment.. not more than 700 square feet, and yet to vacuum I have to plug and unplug and plug and unplug. The cord is not very long at all. It picks up the dog hair on my hardwood floors very well, but doesnt touch the hair on the carpet. It also doesnt pick up much dust - just hair. All in all I'm pretty disappointed with it and we will be buying another vacuum cleaner."
2,I wouldn't buy this again,I had an electric broom for years to pick up dust and dog hair from the hardwood floors. I bought this one to replace it after it died a noble death and it just doesn't work as well. I have A LOT of dog hair in my house and I have to basically hand feed the clumps into the bottom of the machine. Apparently it picks up dust motes but not a whole lot more. My friend has one of those electric Swiffers from the grocery store that seems to do a better job.
4,good choice,helps to vaccum areas to tight to get with the regular vaccum and its really good to vaccum furniture and mattress's.
3,ok.,"It's light, easy to use for a quick pickup and easy to put away; with the collapsible handle it takes up very little space & can fit anywhere. Easy to use, and empty. Although I wasn't expecting the suction of an expensive vacuum, I was expecting just a little more suction. It will pick up dust and very light dirt, but little else. For example, when I spilled some salt, it finally picked up most of it after repeatedly going over it. All in all, it is ok for minor pickups in my small office; and, probably wouldn't buy it again."
2,Worked really great...for a while!,"My vacuum worked really great. For about two months. I have hardwood floors and I really liked it. I mean, the cord is WAY to short, but I just hooked an extension cord to it and went on my way. That is until the part that keeps all the crud in the cup and not in the motor broke. I heard this strange noise and smelt something odd, I took off the bottom part and there was a huge wad of cat hair jammed in the motor intake. I pulled it out and it worked fine for a few days. Then there was a light coming from the vacuum when I last used it...i don't know if it was a small fire or a bunch of sparks, but nonetheless...I shut it off. And promptly threw it away. I think I paid 25 dollars but for only two months of use I sure don't think it was worth it."
1,Next to worthless,"It is a poor design all around. Useful for maybe a dorm room but nothing else. It can pick up small amounts of loose dirt, but nothing larger than dust. The filter clogs quickly and you loose what little suction you started with. Takes about 20 trips to empty and clean for a small one bedroom apartment."
2,Big dustbuster - that's it,"I bought this vac for my RV, so it would see relatively light use. Our camper has carpeting, so I needed something that will pick up dirt that gets tracked into the camper. This vac did a fair job on the bare linoleum floor but did horribly on the low pile carpeting. I returned it and just got a Hoover Flair S220. It is a little heavier but does a much better job and still stores in a very small space. It even does a good job with pet hair! I recommend you spend the extra $20 and get the Hoover Flair."
3,Decent little Vac,"Our new place is all hardwood floors, so we wanted a decent quality ""electric broom"". This one has pretty good suction, and does a decent job cleaning with no tendency to blow stuff around instead of picking it up. On the less desirable side, it has trouble picking up items which are right in a corner, or against the edge of the wall. Cord is a little short, but usable, and construction is quite cheap but so far (1 month) it's holding up ok."
4,good little vacuum,"i got the vacuum much faster than promised. it is a good little vacuum. perfect for my studio apartment. good suction. good size. not recommended for anything bigger than a one bedroom, but great for a small space."
4,Great for dust bunnies and pet hair!,Works great on bare floors....not good for carpets but bare floors is what I bought it to use on. VERY lightweight. The only thing I don't like about it is that the cord is not really long enough....I have lots of floors! Otherwise good product and great price.
1,Hardly pics up anything,"Got this to use for regular cleaning so my baby can have tummy time on the floor, it hardly pics up anything. I can see the dirt on the floor (hair, small paper, dust bunny) and even after running the vacuum over it several times it still stays on the floor. Happened to drop some cous cous on the floor and this vacuum cleaner did nothing! I ended up picking up more cous cous with the shoes I was wearing (got stuck to them but not sucked up by the vacuum)."
2,Does not Pick up Lint at all,I have a black carpet and this vacuum barely pics up anything at all. I was fooled by the positive reviews. This is probably only good for picking up dust or hair off of furniture. If it was free to return I would have returned it that day. I hate it.
5,"So Far, So Good","I have been pleasantly surprised by this inexpensive vacum. It has great sucktion for its size and is very, very portable. It is very easy to empty also. The only down side I have found so far is the length of the power cord. I have many outlets so it has not been a problem but if you are outlet poor then you will need an extension cord. All in all for the price I don't see how you can beat this machine!***One note, this works great on tile or hardwood but does not do well at all on any type of rug."
4,Great for light cleaning,"Works great on bare hardwood floor, not so much on carpet/rugs (even 1/4"" thick rug). But hey, it's a $20 dollar vacuum - very effective for the price. Simple to use and the ability to use it as a hand-held vacuum is definitely a bonus. Perfect for my tiny apartment."
2,its a broom,It is just a broomits not like a vacum- doesnt have any power behind itand I felt like it didnt pick up hair at all
4,Very good for what it is,"Some things are difficult to rate with stars, because you can't really compare them to the big boys. This little thing looks like a toy--yellow plastic. It is surprisingly efficient, however, at picking up dust, crumbs, pet hair etc. It is lighweight, which is good, and it can be used as a hand vac also. There are two reasons I would not give this five stars in its category(lightweight quick hard floor vacuums): 1)The cord is too short for what I need. I have an old house with few plugs, and there are places that could not be reached without an extension cord. This would not be a problem in homes with enough outlets. 2)The base floor sweeper part is small, smaller than it looks in the picture, so it doesn't sweep much of an area at a time. Of course that is part of why it weighs so little. In spite of those two things, however, I paid $20 for it and it's definitely excellent for that price. It's a deal."
3,Not as efficient as older model,"This was not as efficient as the older model I have. The body was a bit bulky and it wasn't as lightweight. It doesn't pick up cat litter granules very well, which was why I purchased it. A little disappointing."
4,Really great vacuum for the price!,"I just got this in the mail today and used it on my Pergo floors and area rug. The suction is great! I am pleasantly surprised! A great vacuum for the price. I have to agree with other reviewers, the cord is very short. I may just use an extension cord with it all the time. The vacuum even reaches corners and edges well. As I was vacuuming the floor my toddler dumped the remains of the pretzel bag on the couch, I took off the bottom piece and it worked great!In total you get 3 pieces: The trunk of it with extender arm, the bottom floor piece, and the crevice attachment. A small vacuum, doesn't take up much space, and so far sucks better than my larger more expensive vacuum!I'll update my review if my opinion changes!"
1,disappointed,"When I first got this, it was wonderful. I used it probably once a week to vacuum my kitchen and hardwood floors. My big vacuum cleaner is a real hassle and very heavy, so this was a great touch up cleaner. As time went on, the suction started to fail, even though I cleaned, brushed and washed the filter every time I used it. By the end of December, it was not usable any more and I had purchased it the middle of August. I was quite disappointed, but I would still like to find a lightweight vacuum for stairs, quick hardwood floor touch ups, etc. So, I will keep searchingVirginiaAnn Arbor, MI"
5,Eureka Lightweight Easy Clean Up Upright Vac,"Very light weight, easy to use and quick. Better for floors for sure. There's no spinning brush, so it really don't work on carpet. Possible industrial carpeting would be flat enough to pick up messes, but its much better on flooring."
5,great cleaner,"I used this in my carpeted college dorm, then in my carpeted/tiled apartment, and now in my hardwood room. It isnt quite handheld, but thats not what you wanted anyway. Good suction and power for something this size. Obviously you should pick up the really big pieces before you vacuum. Remember to empty frequently because if you dont, the suction power diminishes as the bagless trap fills up. Great for smaller areas and cleaning up quick messes."
1,Caused more mess than it cleaned!!,"I bought this to put in my horse trailer with living quarters because of all the reviews about how great it was and wanted something small and lightweight. The first time I used it I could smell dust. It has great suction and sucked up the dirt, sand and grass (lots of in and out on rodeo weekends)but then it blew the fine dust all over the trailer. I had to dust everything and revacuum the whole thing when I got home. Didn't save me any time or do the job I needed. I'll be looking form something else."
4,Perfect for the RV,"I bought the Eureka boss for use in our RV and when I unpacked it, my opinion was that it was very flimsy and could break easily. I tried it in the RV and it cleaned the hard floor and the carpeted areas very well. My thought was - thank goodness we have no children here as the cleaner would be broken in a flash, but with careful adults it works well."
1,"Not Easy, Not Clean","This ""upright vacuum cleaner is not very good. The cup which holds the dirt is very small and fills very quickly. I would have been better off with a broom and a dustpan, which is what I ended up buying as well."
4,FAZOR,"I love my vacuum so much that I named it Fazor. I love my vacuum so much that my roommate compares me to Monk. It's cleaning deficiencies are made up for by its character and charm. But, honestly, it is a good vacuum. Very light weight, and an excellent size. The retractable handle is also handy."
4,Great for tile and wood,"For the price, you can't beat it. Works way better than the Dirt Devil Broom Vac, don't buy that! I know people like cordless items but they just don't have as much power as the plugged-in versions."
1,Terrible product does not work well,"This is my first review for Amazon, I have not reviewed other products since I have been generally satisfied with them. I bought this to vaccum a 4'x6' rug and it is incapable of performing the job. I live in a sandy area so some sand gets on this rug, I think this vaccum expells more sand into the air than it picks up. Also the suction does not seem very good as it doesn't pick up well. Additionally the construction of the floor agitator and wheel assembly is about the same as a childrens toy, which is about the performance you should expect from this product. The only things that I can say which is positive is that it is relatively quiet and it is light. Overall, I would rate this as almost useless, unless you are teaching a small child to vaccum."
1,Whimpy,"I didn't need a 10hp vaccum, this was meant for bare floors. Still my broom and dustpan are cheaper, quieter and more theraputic. Also the cord is not very long."
3,vacuum cleaner,Worked well at first but too effective as days go by. Tried changing bag also. But continuing to use it.
3,It works,I got this from my debit card reward. It's an okay product. The suction is okay. Picks up hair too (see my picture) above. Its a good way to retire your broom and stop carrying a dust pan.
1,Waste of money,This is a horrible product. I wanted something lightweight but this vacuum barely cleans anything and is very poorly made. Even cordless vacuums have better suction.
4,Does the job of some big machines,Great little vacuum! Does the big jobs and is little tiny! My only complaint is that I have to clean the brushes frequently or it won't pick up hair....but all in all an impressive little machine! Even my husband was impressed.
1,Terrible Product,"I purchased the Eureka lightweight vacuum cleaner for my Dad. He received it in the beginning of February of 2010. It is now the beginning of May, 2010, and the thing is completely broken. He only used it a few minutes every few days, and the other day it just started smoking and then died. I purchased it because the reviews said it was a good product. I can assure you, it is not. It is truly a piece of junk. I have never had problems with Hoover vacuums, and from now on, I would tell people to run, not walk, to buy Hoover vacuums. Don't waste your time, or your money, on Eureka."
2,FLIMSY MADE,It is too flimsy. Picks up ok but it is cheap and that why I bought it. So for small messes it is good.
2,light work,"i am so glad i only paid $20 for this at Kmart, i do a better job getting on my hands and knees. if you just need crumbs picked up around the house it is ok. it dose get rid of some lighter dirt in the carpet. however do not rely on it of anything else i wish i knew there was a video thing or i would have uploaded one. you have to see it in acktion to juge it."
1,eureka lightweight vaccume=,Frankly speaking i am not satisfied at all. the same thing i have before and i paid less than what i have paid to you
5,Eureka Upright Vacuun,"The Eureka Lightweight Easy Upright Vacuum Cleaner is true to its name! It work well, easy to use and easy to store! Love the features.Thank you,MACOrlando. FL"
3,it's a OK vacuum for small apartment,"it's working all right, worth the price. But the dust seems to come out of the vacuum body when I'm vacuum cleaning the floor. Not a good choice for large area. you might have to empty the dust basket every ten minutes..."
1,this product sucks,"I received this product yesterday, plugged it in and right away I noticed it was garbage barely picking up anything, today I plugged it in and it won't even turn on tried several outlets, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone save your money"
3,great for a while,this product was great for about a year then it would not pick up. the motor ran but it had no suction
2,"Too short cord, and not enough suction. Needs a redesign!","This may be OK for extremely 'light duty' vacuuming of hard floors, but that's about it. This thing barely has any useable suction. I have a 5 year old who drops a good amount of crumbs on the floor and this pathetic vac won't even pick up half of them. It will pick up light stuff like dog or cat hair and small crumbs, but that's about it. The cord is also way too short, and you'll have to constantly replug into another outlet unless your house/rooms are small. A redesign with more suction is definitely in order!"
4,Great Little Vacuum!!!,"Although this vacuum looks and feels like a toy, it really picks up the cat hair my long-haired leaves on the rugs and furniture! I like that it has a power cord (which is decent a length) so it doesn't lose power mid-way through the task. The dust cup is a litte hard to remove without rubber gloves, which also work great in removing the pet hair from the filter (you will be shocked at how much is in there). Would recommend wearing a face mask too."
1,JUNK,"If your considering buying this, do yourself a favor and buy a broom instead. This thing is ALMOST as useful as one.Cord is short, cannot reach across medium sized room. I live in an old house with few plugs, but do you really need to change plugs while dust-busting? Too heavy to use as a hand held, with an awkward shape, makes for emptying canister a little tricky. The handle needs to be extended to empty, which is also awkward. After using 3 times, has begun to have a burning smell after more than 5 min of use.This is just JUNK."
4,perfect for the money,"I only got to try this briefly, but I do have to say so far I am very happy with my purchase. I have hardwood floors througtout my entire house and got tired of having to recharge my swiffer after cleaning half of the house. The cord is a bit short but I will most likely just buy an extension cord to alleviate the issue. Overall I loved that I could sweep the rugs in the bathroom and also clean the tile floors and pick up all the cat hair. Does seem a bit flimsy but for the price i am pleased. Before i purchased i did not realize it could be taken apart and used as a hand held as well...an added bonus for sure."
4,Excellent Small Vacuum,"I ordered this product about 3 months ago and have been extremely satisfied with it. As many of the reviews have detailed, it does not do well on long or shaggy carpets, which is unfortunate. However, I live in a dorm with largely hardwood floor and tile in the bathroom and it is perfect for picking up hair, dust, and the like. The cord is rather short for a normal vacuum, but I would venture to say if you are buying this vacuum then you probably need it for a smaller space or easy pick up work, and the cord is a perfect length for that. The removable floor nozzle and telescope handle features are very handy, especially for vacuuming in tight spaces. As long as you go in knowing the limitations and what you need the product for, then I think you will be extremely satisfied as well! It's a great vacuum for a cheap price."
3,IT ONLY WORKED FOR 1 YEAR,This is a good little vacuum but unfortunately I went to use it today (bought it last Nov) and it overheated after 5 minutes and stopped working.
2,not that powerful,"This is a light, small and inexpensive vacuum cleaner, but when it comes to cleaning it's not that powerful. I would recommend it as a travel thing or something you just use every once in a while for small places, but not as a main vacuum cleaner for your whole house."
2,"As the title says, it's 'LIGHTWEIGHT'","Honestly, it doesn't work on carpet home at all. It's too light, and only suitable for bathroom floor or kitchen floor, anywhere without carpet."
1,Worked OKAY until it BROKE!,"It did the job. I didn't expect much considering the price, however I did expect it to last more than 4 months..I followed proper cleaning instructions and usage to a T and it just crapped out on me. One day I turned it on, smelled burning, saw sparks. Game over. Trying to figure out how to get my money back or some kind of replacement..? Does anyone have an idea of how to do this?"
1,a vacuum that does not suck,It is an absolute piece of garbage. It has very little if any suction. How can I retuen it without the packaging???d
1,Pay more for a far better Eureka stick cleaner,I got one of these a few years ago. Unless they have changed the motor's power I strongly recommend paying another $25-30 for the Eureka cordless model 2 in 1 Easy Clean cleaner.My experience with this model is abysmal. It has too little suction power for even small pickups such as pieces of cat food and is a nuisance to plug in to a different outlet each time you go to another room. Sure it converts to a hand vac but you have to lower the handle and pull off the base part which gives you a smaller but better suction input or put on the easily lost crevice tool. Spend the additional money and you will get a 1000 percent better cleaner with the model 108-A. Read the review I posted for my 108-A before you buy this one.
2,Small Hand Eureka Vaccum,"I don't like this product at all, I wish I could return it to its original owner. It's all plastic which will break should you drop it or it slides down on to my hardwood floor. The handle is much too short, you have to bend down to run it over a floor and it's manufactured in China; China is producing a lot of inferior products."
2,Cheap feel to it,"I've had the Eureka 96B model for about 1 1/2 years and I prefer it MUCH better than this model. I actually got this Eureka 166DX model as a gift through my work. I'm glad I didn't pay for it because it's so much more cheaper feeling than the 96B. I'm disappointed that it has a cord and that it is not chargeable. If you want one that works really well, spend the extra $10.00 for the 96B model. It's really worth it."
1,Misrepresented,"I bought this stick vacuum from Target direct. It was advertised as a new product. When it arrived the box was damaged and retaped. It was obvious it was a badly used return. To top it off, the handle will not stay extended. It keeps collapsing not matter what I do to keep it up. I am disabled so it is too much trouble to send it back.This was terrible misrepresentation."
4,WOW!!! Worth the money and more!!,I went to the PX (military mall) to get a vacuum for my hardwood floors. I just got tired of sweeping everyday yeah im lazy after work lol. Anyway i saw this and a dirt devil something cant remember but i checked the reviews and this had far better reviews i was kind of skeptical at first for a $20 item you dont expect much. But all i can say is WOW this thing picks up very very hell ill say it again very well. The only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the head could be maybe a little bigger. But im happy no more sweeping. Yeah!!! Thanks again Eureka!!!
4,Almost Perfect!,"We got this little guy for our new tile and laminate floors and Wow(!)this thing can suck! We also received it the day after we ordered it - I assume because its free shipping offer isn't part of the SuperSaver shipping deal w/Amazon, but rather just a *free* shipping deal.Anyway, we ended up putting it in our RV (for a while) because of the short cord and noise (minor frustrations). Then we ended up trying the Bissell Perfect Sweep Turbo -- which is a rechargeable cordless vacuum -- but ended up switching it to RV usage because it just couldn't cut it on highly textured tile. We've decided we'd rather hook the Boss stick vac up to an extension cord, deal with the noise, and have a much cleaner floor. I am simply amazed at the suction power of this thing!I just wish I hadn't wasted my money on the Bissell. Ah, well...live and learn.P.S. If the Bissell can't cut it in the RV, then I'll be getting another Boss stick vac! You can't beat the price and the free shipping deal."
1,"You get what you pay for "" Toy Vacuum""","The speed of getting the vacuum was awesome. But as for the quality of it. I would agree with other users. Very light, flimsy, cheap, and doesn't pick up that well but you get what you pay for. Def not a good vacuum for any home if you want to clean floor or tile. It does half the work it should do. I think if the amps were little higher it might have better suction. Other then that would never buy or suggest to anyone."
1,Broke after fewer than 10 uses,This broke after fewer than 10 uses. Very disappointing. I suppose you get what you pay for - save your money.
1,"Was okay for 4 months, then stopped working","I bought this vacuum in September and used it about once a week for a small one-bedroom apartment. It worked okay for the price, sucking most stuff up off the floor. I used it to vacuum up stray cat litter, and due to the vacuum's design there was always stray litter particles stuck in the head of the vacuum that were impossible to get out. If it kept working like this I would have given it three stars, but in January (4 months later) it just wouldn't turn on. I guess you get what you pay for, but seriously, four months? Save your money."
2,Impossible to empty,I got it apart once with great difficulty and now cannot get it apart after 10 minutes of trying.How am I going to empty it? (I followed the directions and nothing works)
3,Great for kitchan crumbs,"I have a heavy duty hepa vaccuum that cleans up anything and won'ts clog so I was a little disappointed that this didn't do better on carpeting. I just wanted something for the stairway and the cord is too short for that. Otherwise it works on a bare floor, kitchen, front entry or bathroom or if you have hardwood and easy to empty out dirt cup. Very lightweight."
4,"Little package, Big pickup","This truly is a lightweight vacuum, so you have to be mindful of that and be gentle with it. With that being said, I am very pleased so far (even somewhat surprised) with its pickup. It really does the trick, and I have used it for more than just the kitchen, small areas, and steps - though I would not suggest major vacuuming jobs. It is very compact and can be stored in a small area. When dumping out the debris, my suggestion would be to hold it over a trashcan and lightly tab the debris off into the can. I have even washed the cup in warm water. It is really a nice little machine in a small package if you can deal with the size. I do wish, however, the 15 ft. cord was slightly longer."
4,"Hey, it's *Tupperware*!","I bought two of these because I was looking for a divided tray type of thing to put veggies in, instead of buying the $10 vegetable and dip trays at the grocery store all of the time. The main problem I have with the serving center set is with the shape! It's huge, and it's round! I'd like something more along the lines of a rectangular shape like the space-saving designed veggie trays in the stores. Oh, I knew it was round when I bought it. It's great for dry snacks when the kids have their friends over; but I wouldn't recommend buying it if you plan on sticking it in your fridge very often. It takes up a lot of room."
4,Well made,"Finding a hose coupling this size was not easy. It is well made and grips tight to the hose. Made of some top quality plastic that takes a pretty good beating. Not exactly rocket science, but when you need a hose coupling in this size, this is a decent product."
3,Now made in China,"These do the job but are now made in China, all Gilmour products used to be made in the USA until a couple years ago. They still have the lifetime warranty."
5,Excellent Start,"Personally, I tend to like this Trivium album better. Maybe it's the fact that it was released on a smaller label and it's not as overhyped as ""Ascendancy"" (don't get me wrong, I like that CD also).Also, this disc tends to be on the more thrash side than the heavy metal side ""Ascendancy"" is on. The title track, ""Ember To Inferno"", might get you into the CD, as it's less of a thrash track and more melodic. Other tracks like ""Pillars of Serpents"" tend to be on a more early hardcore/metal crossover action. It varied and it stands out well.If they're any thing that the band may need to improve, it may be the vocals, but if you are a true fan, you'll pass the fact that Matt Heafy was only 17 when he recorded this disc. And that's what close-minded people give s**t to Trivim, sadly. Also, consider the fact that they are very talented for a band under the United States drinking age. Just like Decapitated was when they created ""Winds of Creation"".I recommend this."
4,Damn Good First Album,"This album rocks! I remember back in the day, a band's first album was their best or close to it (Metallica, Slayer, Testament, Machine Head, Iron Maiden) but lately that seems to be the opposite. Bands seem to get better these days with each album. If that's the case then we are in for a real treat as far as Trivium is concerned. The songs on this album are poundingly heavy but aslo have a feel of maturity in its musicianship. The solos are great (moslty because they are there at all). I was impressed with this album the first time i listened to it and it only got better. Buy this album (Ascendency is better but this one is still F***ing great!)"
5,metal 4 life,"Trivium is a metal band,consisting of Matt Heafy lead singer and back up guitar, Cory Belue lead guitar, Palo forgive me I don't know his last name bass, and Travis Smith drums.This album is great.I love the heavy riffs, machine gun like beats and offcouse the solo's.Unlike many Metal bands today Trivium uses alot of melodic techniuqe in there music which makes it sound so perfect.This band has soo much talent and these guys are so young the lead singer is only 21 years old.Will see how far these guys go although not the next Metallica they are making waves.I seen them live with Machine Head/Lamb of God/ tour and they absoulutly blew me away with song's like A gun shot to the Head of trepidation, Rain, Pull Harder on your strings of Martyr. I have to give them the credit the deserve.If you like this album pick up Triviums Ascendency.There are a few songs that I absoulutly love on this album."
4,Metal is coming back,"I saw them live with Iced Earth. They were great for a band I had never heard of. I decided to buy this album and was blown away. Vocals are great, guitars and drumming is excellent. They keep getting better. The next album is 100 times better and this one is awesome. Trivium is going to be huge."
5,An amazing work,This album just blows me away. There are so many amazing moments. This band is very talented. Definitely buy if you are into good ol headbanging metal.
5,From Ember To Inferno!,This is triviums first album and what an album it is not better then ascendancy in my eyes but there are some absoultely brilliant headbangers on this aswell crazy stuff!
5,Masterpiece,"There is nothing like Trivium. Nothing can compare. Nothing. Zip. Nada. You just can't get that feel of angst anywhere else in the land of Metal.This is Trivium's first full length cd, and it's on LifeForce records, not RoadRunner Records. This cd has a distinct flavor to it. This cd seems like it has 3 Parts Thrash, and 1 part metal.Each song is a masterpiece in itself. Definately check it out if you like Trivium. If you are into 80's and 90's thrash and metal, CHECK THIS OUT! If you are into metal, get it. I can't explain in words how good this cd is! Just check it out!"
4,They're SO beautiful,"This pairs of flat are very beautiful, i just got them, the fist time i saw them it was love at first sight, but unfortunately they are so uncomfortable in the ankle, because they have an elastic band, but beside that they are really soft, problably i should bought them in a biger size but i didn't knew. the material of the flats are Wow, first class, the are very glamorus, if you want a ""Chic girl"" look, with these flats you will have that. i use them with a cotton pad to protect my ankle. But my recomendation to you it's that bought them in a biger size, because they worth it."
4,"LOVE, REHASHED AND RE-RELEASED, FROM THE HEART.","All you need from love is a love song. Or so the song goes. And Decca certainly knows the value of heartfelt music. And the mastery of repackaging and rehashing. The 14 tunes on this CD have all been released before --- there's nothing rare, nothing never-before-heard, there are no demos or outtakes. Still, what's here has been culled from Decca and Decca-affiliate cast albums and recordings and is worth a listen. There's something new, something old, starting with Siobhan McCarthy's ""The Winner Takes All."" There's Julie Andrews' take on ""My Funny Valentine,"" Betty Buckley's ""Memory,"" Donny Osmond and Vanessa Williams promising ""Not While I'm Around."" Jerry Orbach asking that we ""Try to Remember,"" Bernadette Peters vowing that ""Time Heals Everything,"" Anna Maria Alberghetti insisting that ""Love Makes the World Go Round."" I have dreamed of better CD compilations for people like us. But for now ..."
3,Soft but small,"The dimensions are on the link, but I still expected it to be larger. It is super soft and very thick. It made me sweat just having it draped over the back of my glider. My toddlers find it irresistible, although it is not intended for them. I bought it for my baby, and it is, of course, a good size for her to have tummy time on, but not much else. It is not a good size for a toddler to use as an actual blanket, and much too thick for a tropical winter. I plan to keep it as a lovey blanket, but it's awfully expensive for just a ""Linus"" blanket with no function."
5,Great Blanket,This blanket is so soft and perfect for any age child. I bought one for my son when he was born in 2011 and now for the second baby due in March of this year. It's just the right size and he loves to snuggle up to this blanket when he lies down. I would recommend this blanket over any other blanket out there this is a one of the kind blanket. It washes perfectly and does not break down and is still as soft as when we first got it.
1,Don't order this product from AMAZON,"Do not order this product from Amazon. I first ordered it about 3 months ago and when I received it the product was dried up and the packaging was opened and dusty (as if it had been in a storage shed for years). I sent that package back and they sent me a replacement which had the same problem. I spoke to a rep. at Amazon and they said they must have had a bad shipment so they will have someone look into it and I should wait a while before ordering again. I waited 3 months, ordered the product and when I received it, the packaging was opened, dusty, the lids were off the jars and the creams were melted and spilling out! Worst than the first two times I ordered! When I called back they didn't have any notes about looking into the previous problem. I normally wouldn't be so crazy about the appearance of the product but they are chemicals that you are putting on your face and I did not want to chance putting an old, half melted, dried up product on my skin!"
4,Beautifully written,"I chose to read this book mainly because it had been nominated for the Booker Prize although I know this does not always guarantee a good read.I have to say that I was not too excited about the subject matter before I began reading it and I expected the storyline to be a little silly.However,I am now a devoted Mick Jackson reader due to the beautiful prose throughout the book.I was enthralled by the adventures of the Duke and he made me laugh,cry and even squirm while reading.I agree with the reviewer below however, regarding the hypochondria section-it tended to be quite slow-moving,so I'm only giving it 4 instead of 5 stars.The first half of the book,though, is wonderful and this alone makes it worth buying.The ending,although a little contrived,truly shocked me and I can't get it out of my mind.I look forward to more work from Mick Jackson."
2,"Frustrating, tedious fun","Do not buy this. I am going right out and saying it. Mabye if you really want to, rent it. the mini games are fun, and are the only redeeming value, every other time you will be bored or frustrated. the graphics are neat, with the cell shading techniques. Also, the load times are not so bad, but every time you do something else besides play the board game, you undergo 2 long load times.(eg, you land on a mini game, it loads, you play it, it loads again) all in all, i expected more in a mario party spin-offp.s- i do not even own a N64 so dont think i am biased to it"
1,Only buy this if you are a Sonic collector,"I used to think that there would never be a bigger mistake than Sonic Labyrinth. Sonic Shuffle showed me I could be wrong. If you like cel-shading, you might like the art here, but the characters look too flat compared to their surroundings. The music is not Sonicy at all but it does fit the overall mood of the game: irritating. This one was made by a different crew though. The voice acting is dreadful and the lines are corny. The game is extremely slow and dull. The only way to stop the Dreamcast from beating you is to be really lucky or have 4 people playing. Younger kids will be frustrated with this one and older Sonic fans like me will be disappointed. If you have to have everything Sonic like I do, then get this. Otherwise, leave it alone. Get something like Sonic Adventure or Sonic Adventure 2, they're better games and they show off the Dreamcast better than Sonic Shuffle."
2,didnt like this much,"i played this game for a good 30 minutes before i gave up. this is [the same as] mario party, but it is much worse. i loved mario party so i was eager to give this one a shot. thhe adventure mode is so boring. it is like playing a board game for that has nothing going on except for the occasional mini game. they werent unique or interesting either. pass this one by folks."
2,Not what I expected,"I read reviews before buying this game and thought it might be fun. Boy was I wrong. What sold me was the possibility of finally playing a Sonic game with more than one person at a time. There is no action in this game. It's basically a child's poker game. Slow and boring. I wish I could return it, but you all know the... return policy. If you like playing cards, buy someplaying cards. If you like playing video games, don't buy this game."
3,"It's trying to be Mario Party, but doesn't quite cut it...","I got this game as part of the sonic bundle with the other sonic games and the dreamcast. Boy, I'm glad I didn't buy it separately.First of all, this game has great graphics. They are cartoony and are very good. But, the gameplay is boring and confusing, plus the mini-games will leave you yawning. I am an avid Sonic fan, but this game was just so so."
3,Summation,"Since the previous review has already covered the details of the game, I will be brief. The game is interesting enough and is a good game for the whoile family to play together. However, the mini-games are very brief and anti-climactic, so it is unlikely that older players will get into the game. It is a nice game, but not very exciting. It does make great use of the VMU, allowing you to see your own cards on the controller. This is a great game for families who play together, otherwise rent it first to be sure its for you."
3,Average game...but fun.,"Party games are all the rage. Sonic Shuffle, the Dreamcast's Mario Party and Crash Bash, was sold just after the release of Sonic Adventure to keep it popular. In Sonic Shuffle, you start out with 4 characters-4 others are hidden. The object of the game is to race around the board collecting rings, Precioustones, Forcejewels and other knicknacks. The graphics are very anime-esque, and I love the music. Just listen to the tutorial background music! My only complaint, though, is that it's too cookie-cutter--you have to beat the level in 1st place to continue to the next level. The plot? Very ridiculous. Overall okay."
1,Don't buy this game!,"At first, i thought this game would be good... My aunt and i were shopping for my b-day present, when all of a sudden i saw a sonic game. and you'all no how cool sonic is. But wait.... this game is a copy of Mario Party 1+2. Now c'mon, sega's copying nintendo now??? This game looks good, but it really isnt. You probably think that my review is bad, but, if u buy this game you'll see what i mean."
2,Mario Party with the Sonic name on it,"Before I wanted this, I expected this to be a fun, entertaining experience. Instead, I got this: bad AI, boring gameplay, and only 8 playable characters. I expected more out of Sonic Shuffle.On paper, Sonic Shuffle is great: picking out cards, moving to spaces, and getting the most Precious Stones. In practice, it is the opposite. This is a very boring game, and with the AI, they can be very hard to beat, even on the Easy difficulty setting. The game's story is horrible: A fairy named Lumina asks the Sonic team to help her get Precious Stones and save everyone's dreams from Void. Yeah, it's a baby story.The graphics are suprisingly good.The sound is so bad.This game doesn't live up to its full potential. Add minigames that are either frustrating or confusing, and you've got one of the worst games ever made."
1,Would give this 0 stars--but it looks neat,"Rent Mario Party instead--nuf said. No, really?!! Don't have an N64, well rent that as well just to play MP 1-3, Zelda MofM and that neat ole Bond shooter. This game has horrible load times, boring games, an AI that'd win games against the Pentagon's computers because it cheats, and a general 'nintendo' rip off feel. Leaves a horrible taste in your mouth for Sonic games. Thank the game gods that Sonic Advenutre 2 is out and redeems the Sonic series. [...]"
1,Boring,"This game is nothing short of using the Sonic name in vain.The game essentially revolves around a board game that the Sonic characters play across to acheive goals and fulfill assignments. On their way they are accompanied by a very annoying and unhelpful and 'cute' fairy, and the entire game wears off really fast.Skip this one."
2,The games was a bust-------read on,"I was so hyped about this game but it is a total bustFirst, the game plot is soooo dumb. Second, there are sooo many times this game loades and it takes so fricken long. Third, remember playing Mario Party and playing Mini-Games every turn. Wasn't that great? Well in Sonic Shuffle its possible to play a whole game and play no mini-games, and when you do play a mini-game its sooo complicated and its not all that fun either. Fourth, the song is annoying.All in all, although i absolutely LOVE DREAMCAST, i am a huge Sonic fan, and a huge Mario Party fan, this game is a total BUST. BUMMER!"
1,What kinda party game is this?,"I have Mario Party 1 and 2 and they came out befoe this.Sonic Shuffle is a mario party wannabe.The mini games stink on ice.And its pointless,all you do is pick a card and it walks by itself.If you wanna good sonic game get sonic adventure 2.This has bad graphics and takes a long time to play."
3,"Its mario party, just messed up","Well I havent got much to say escept for what the title says I played the first world it seemed like mario party but to me the cards are an annoying way of moving I liked blocks better, andthe minigames arent that great, some are fun like tag and he eggman legs onebut thats all i have to say"
4,"Stop whining, it's good for what it is","Those looking for a party game for they're dead Dreamcast can do no wrong with Sonic Shuffle, no matter what the negative reviews might say. At first I didn't like it when I played Sonic Shuffle (it came with my Dreamcast when I bought it in the Sonic Bundle) but it grew on me more and more, and the meat and bones of Sonic Shuffle is that you need three other players to have some real fun with it. Similarities to Mario Party are expected, but this isn't quite a rip-off of it (although some may beg to differ). The graphics are superb Dreamcast quality and are nicely rendered and colorful, while the whimsical sound effects and smooth controls add to the overall package. All in all, at a cheap price you really can't go wrong with Sonic Shuffle."
3,Sonic Shuffle Review !,"If you are a huge Sonic fan you will like this game but it probably won't be your favorite. I myself am a huge Sonic the Hedgehog fan and I think this game is okay. If you like Mario Party it's like the same thing only it's a lot slower, a few mini games and a bunch of crap you don't want to deal with. If you want my opinion stick with the Sonic Adventure games and if you still want to by Sonic Shuffle try to buy it under seven dollars !"
4,A very fun rainy day game,"Yes, I will be the first to admit that this game is a lot like mario party. But for someone who doesn't have the 20-50 bucks to shell out for a mario party game this is a very good buy. I played it for a while, and while its currently on my mantle, after this review I'm popping into my dreamcast. Why? because it's fun and the story line is semi-diffucult and enough to keep me comming back for more, because when I do finish a level in 1st, it makes me feel all the better. The mini games I have run into require a bit of finnese and a lot of luck and that's what I was looking for in this type of game. I wish they would have had shadow, but this came out before he did, and that is the only negitive in my book.Overall, If you like sonic, and mario party, get this game.If you don't like seeing sonic walk around a board, Don't get this game. But you will be missing out on something fun.Replay value: 3 out of 5Amount of fun for your money: 4 out of 5 (If you pay 10 or less)"
4,Not hard to make a decision on this one....,"Ok so you have to make your mind up when watching this if she was raped or not...NO IT WAS NOT.....watch this documentary with an open mind, as i did. i did not judge this untill the end...then i came up with ""no it as not rape"" that girl could have left at any time, and never made an attempt to do so...make you own mind up but do watch this..very interesting.no it was not rape.she got scared and cried rape...i would say she regrets that now."
2,Won't be talking in my town,"I was really hoping the writers would redeem themselves with this book. Unfortunately not. All the name dropping and descriptions of who had on what and making sure nearly every designer was mentioned grew old fast. The characters were all selfish, insecure and conceited in their own way. Dakota's reference to Lisa's Payless shoes was just nasty. When I read a novel, be it fiction or non, I look to be educated or learn something that can be used to educate someone else. Looking over my shoulder seductively in a thong isn't exactly what I had in mind. The writers made sure to mention the use of condoms, but only after they had ""nibbled"" on their partner's goods, first. Call me crazy, but what's the use? Believe me, I wasn't talking about this book in my town, and San Francisco may not be the New York metropolis, but we still know how to do it, whether we have, or have not. My advice, borrow the book from the library."
2,Typical,"Pretty crappy book. Too much designer name-dropping for my taste. The writers seemed to happy to make sure they advertised expensive designers than writing an interesting story. Also the storyline was bogus, weak, predictable yet unbelievable."
2,Trendy,"After reading the review for the first novel, ""Revenge is Best Served Cold,"" I felt that this novel was the same type of hype. As the critic's wrote, the book is superificial and mainly talks about trendy and very ""she-she"" New York hot spots. I wasn't impressed with the plot or character development. The authors were name-dropping the entire time."
4,Talk of The Town and more,From the first chapter I was hooked. Characters that walked right off the page. I wished Miles had listened to his best friend. Vic and Tricia didn't get what they deserved. An engrossing read from page one to end. I highly reccomend this book.
1,Tracie and Danita does it again?,"They sure do!!!!! They throw a novel together outlining everything BUT a good story. Once again, these authors make every designer in the fashion industry RICH, RICH, RICH! I hope all the designers you mention are kicking you two ladies down because that's all you seem to know how to write about. You would think you would learn from the reviews of Revenge Best Served Cold. STOP TALKING ABOUT GUCCI AND TELL US A STORY. and by the way Tracie, I have on a pair of Payless shoes! How about that, Ms. Howard?As you Amazonee's can see, I'm so disappointed with this novel, and would only recommend it if you care about nothing but fashion! Take it from me. Save your money. Talk of the Town lacks everything from a plot to character development, and instead focuses on what the characters were wearing. Just like Revenge Best Served cold, Talk of the Town should also be served cold."
1,"Nope, sorry...","This one was just as pitiful as their first. Characters were ridiculous, shallow, racist, materialistic and just plain stupid. To call this book garbage would be insulting to garbage.One reviewer called this book ""Glitz & glamour of the Rich and Famous."" I don't know what substance she's abusing, but she's apparently abusing it a lot. The only glitz and glamour is in the minds of the two people responsible for the book (I cannot, in all good faith and fairness, bring myself to call them authors, or even writers), and while some of the people in the book are apparently rich, nobody is famous, except in their imagination. And for every dollar the supposedly rich folks in the book have, they also possess a ton or two of conceit, idiocy and selfishness. A comic book is deeper than this nonsense. WAY deeper. Save your mind; read a real book with a real plot."
3,Better than the First....,"The dynamic duo try their hand at yet another tale of upscale 30 somethings living in New York. But, much like Revenge Served Cold, there is still little that is believable in the plot. You see characters that are smart, beautiful, and compassionate BUT the situations are not very REAL!! I mean, Morgan continues to make business decisions that are totally out of left field, and Dakota seems to be very level headed but can't see obvious signs that something is going on right under her nose (w/ cousin Tricia). The characters were developed more so than in the first novel. We were allowed to know more about the people instead of their wardrobe.At any rate, it is a definite improvement from Revenge. There is not nearly as much attention given to the clothes, clubs, and other superficial nonsense that radiated in the previous book.Can't wait to see if ""Third time is a charm"""
3,An amazing intricate complex tour inside the human body,Robert winston has done it again after his previous body anatomy dvds in revealing to us an astonishing intricate computer generated 3D world of the human body inside and outside which also has a special see-through sections on essential delicate organ parts in the body for living.Also included in this information book is a special CD of captivating images of whats under your flesh and blood or skin to put it more correctly.All in all a must have resource for any medical surgeon who is a qualified practitioner in the field of medicine.
5,pretty interesting and beautiful fashion history doc,"I love vintage fashion, vintage pictures and that special look of the old school mannequins, so this book is strongly suited for my taste; of course Dior (along with Balenciaga and a small bunch of other couturiers, as for that period of time) is the most emblematic designer then.This book is really enjoyable from my point.Ahora para los colegas: una buena recopilación de fotos vintage, de calidad más o menos (más o menos regularen cuanto a la impresión), modelos, las Bettina,Wenda,etc, que eran las que se estilaban por aquel entonces, cinturas de avispa y tal, es curioso lo que aquellos fotógrafos podían hacer con equipos infinitamente más primitivos que los de ahora; hay ""charme"" por un tubo en este libro; pero es sólo para los más más fikis de este tipo de libros.Live long and prosper!"
5,great Monitor,"Great Monitor for the money, Its better than my old one that would heat my small home office up. The review from picky consumer""f"" said the image quality was bad, maybe that person needs to see a eye doctor. Image quality is great, im glad i bought it."
3,"Price is good, but quality is not","I purchased this Acer 19 in LCD monitor for my wife, and she found that the text in small fonts is not clear. It hurts eyes. So we decided to return it to seller"
2,Breaking Very Fast,"I loved this monitor...I had it for 4 months, before it started breaking. I have no idea why and it is leaving me in a very bad place as far as my home office is concerned. Acer doesn't have a contact telephone number, rather an email address. I hope this is not a continue of things to come. I really need high reliablity and hope this is just a fluke. :("
2,You get what you pay for.,"If you are not picky about image quality, go for it. Otherwise get something more expensive. I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast, brightness and viewing angles."
2,Entry level Quality,"If you're looking for an inexpensive flatpanel and aren't concerned with Picture quality, this monitor is for you. Acer keeps the price very low. The design is simple and attractive, but the color representation lacks zest.I've had this monitor now for 6 months and it does everything I need it to for basic business operations. Out of the box the colors are a bit dark and upon increasing the brightness, the white gets VERY white. Colors are drabby and not true to shade.I don't recommend this monitor for anyone interested in graphics/home photos."
1,It lasts 2 years.,I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text.
2,Have not seen any changes,"I am a big fan of the PCA line, it has been the only thing to work on my adult acne (mainly the A&c serum, BPO cleanser and nutrient toner). However, I have been using this product for over a month and I do not see any change on the lines under my eyes. I am so used to having fast results with their products that I expected to see some kind of change after the first month. What I can say about this product is that as small as it is I still have A LOT left,PCA products can be expensive but they do last a long time. I will write another review on my third or fourth month."
4,velvet peepholes,"good debut, excellent craftsmanship. The songs are witty and engaging. The band strikes some similarities to REM at its brightest and most accessible. I really enjoyed the cut ""Gangster..."". The songs are heartfelt, offering a peephole into our lost childlike wonder. I will be looking forward to catching them live."
3,So much for the bonus scenes,"I had seen this film on HBO and I purchased it to screen for the seniors I work with as a social worker at a non-profit agency. The DVD arrived safely and was shrink wrapped. The main portion of the film was fine, but some parts of the bonus scenes (""extras"") were pixilated and corrupted, making portions of them unwatchable. I didn't think I would view that portion again anyway, though, so I just kept it and saved myself the hassle and expense of returning it."
2,no usb,ok..now what do i do with this? it doesn't go into my computer..i think i bought the wrong thing...
1,m2 cards,Never received. Lost in the mail. Orderded from someone else. Customer service no very helpful.
4,Perfect,Its working perfect. I have been using it for a month and have not faced any problems till now.
3,Slow Delivery,"I don't know if the item was out of stock and didn't show up on the site or if they just took long to process the order. It didn't ship from their warehouse until about 2 weeks after I placed the order. Other then that I had no problems, correct product sent and in new condition."
4,Does the job well.,I take a lot of pictures and this does the job I need it to. Highly recommended. Good purchase for those who love to take pictures whether as a hobby or a profession.
5,Very nice,"Got on time. I pulled out a 128 MB card came with the phone, inserted this one (2GB). Filled it up with a lot more things and it's working very nice."
3,Not so good,"The m2 was good, but the adapter is not usefull at all, it just dont work on any cardreader, because it is not the size it was supposed to be."
5,100% recommended !,Sandisk again proves that it makes the best memory card and at a great price. No complaints about this card at all.100% recommended
5,The maiden tribute of modern babylon,"From The London Journal, July 2008:""It is exceedingly useful to have this series of articles gathered together in one place, inclusive of Stead's own commentaries (not always easily distinguishable from the actual reports) and the published responses of his readership for and against the case he was making.... The text has helpful footnotes translating words and phrases in other languages in the original, explicating usages or allusions which might be opaque to the modern reader, identifying named individuals, and so forth. [The editor's introduction] is workmanlike [and] provides an extremely solid account of the relevant laws and their history."""
2,Leading Quietly,It intially grabs you and provides great insight but I found that as the book went along it lost it's nuggets.If you're looking at this book to provide the core skills in leadership then I would recommend searching further.
5,A Great Read for the Business Professional,"This book was an assigned reading material for an MBA class. After reading a few pages I was impressed! This book included ideas for becoming the leader that will truly influence not only professional lives, but personal ones too. If you are interested in improving your leadership structure and obtaining a different mindset, this is the book for you!"
3,Leading Quietly,"The book was used as a textbook, however, it was one I might consider using in a management position."
1,I guess if you're from Harvard you can write whatever...,"This is not a book for leaders. I'm not sure who this book is for. Mr. Badaracco seems to find many of the ordinary human aspects of business startlingly unique, and is pleased to guide us through these unique and unusual places. The problem is, anyone with half an ounce of common sense had Mr Badaracco's epiphany when they were 23. This is old hat. It's common sense.My new goal in life is to somehow get associated with Harvard so I can churn out books stating the obvious and enjoy an avalanche of cash.This book is silly. I'm so disappointed.For an excellent book on leadership and management, check out ""First Break all the Rules"" by the Gallop people. Or connect the unconnectable and read ""If you Want to Write"" by Brenda Ueland. Either will get you much further along than ""Leading Quietly."""
1,The worst leadership book ever written.,"The author needs help. He committed only to a four year study on leadership from some bureaucratic corporate stuffed shirts and wonders why their not inspiring leaders. Leadership is a 10,000 year study,read the bible. Leadership is ones ability to influence others not create committee's. Badaracco managed to squeeze in real leadership traits in with bureaucratic ones as if to substantiate the claim. One knows that most managers and leaders are uninspiring that's why most corporations eventually fail and people change jobs like underwear. There are a lot of books out there, some are complete hype with a catchy title others like this propose to reinvent poor leadership traits in with good ones as if its something new. Don't waste your money. Read some of the old books on leadership and success like the Bible, and get Jim Rohn's The Art of Exceptional Living (Audio)(he has a list of must read books)."
1,Does not work on Windows XP or Vista,"This was going to be such a great gift for my 8 year old. It was even easy to install. However, it did not work on HP Windows XP and it did not work on HP Vista either. After I called the manufacturer, they could not help me either because this item is basically from 1999 and is considered outdated technically speaking. There is no software or downloads to make this compatible. So....save your money."
3,Mostly Works,"This adaptor works great for the bluetooth headset. The Razr side slides in and out and is not a good charging option. I bought it for the bluetooth, so it works fine for me. EFORCITY customer service is HORRIBLE refuse to get back to you."
2,Only okay,"I was looking for a cover for my cell phone and didn't really like the style of the leather or cloth coverings and decided to go with a plastic one. However, I've only had the cover on my phone for only a month and one of the clips has already broken off and the paint on the plastic has chipped off. I would not recommend that you buy this if you are looking for a nice cover."
5,Inspiring,"I would highly recommend this book for those of you who are convinced big business will eventually destroy our earth.I was impressed that a non-scientist/engineer would even attempt to write a book like this. His excitement about the potential for saving the environment came through in his text. He laid out the goals his company had set for achieving a state beyond zero waste, returning to the earth as much as was taken from it. I believe it takes a visionary to apply such abstract ideas and commit to making them real. And the fact that he was able to make a business arguement for sustainable development was reassuring because, realistically, if businesses can be convinced that this will help them make money, it is much more likely to happen. That's clearly what I saw with the pollution prevention movement and it just might happen here."
4,Leica Z2X Camera,"The Leica Z2X camera is possibly the best compact zoom camera currently on the market. The features are about equal to cameras of this kind but the overall quality of the workmanship is excellent. Everything works (functions) exactly like what is documented in the instructions. The quality of the photo's are excellent, most likely due the quality of the optics.Draw backs: Plastic housing makes the camera feel cheap."
2,Disappointed,"Bought this camera in April 1999 having read several good reviews. Have to say I'm disappointed; the lens is undoubtedly sharp (though on normal size prints, the advantage is negligible) but the exposure/focus/flash system rarely gets it right. Exterior daylight shots, about one in four is OK. Inside or night, far less. Have tried different ISO rolls, different processors, variations on the manual settings as well as leaving it on fully auto, but no improvement. What is annoying is comparing with the shots taken under same conditions by friends with P+S Pentax etc. (Olympus seems expecially good). They paid half the price and get twice the result! Will not be buying another Leica compact again - have the impression I paid for the name and possibly the lens, but lost out on the rest."
2,PREFER HIS WORK WITH JACKIE GLEASON,"This is a perfectly pleasant CD but I cannot believe it will be in most peoples top 20 favourites.I doubt you will prefer these versions of Miller tunes to the originals.HOWEVER,Mr Hackett does feature significantly on one of my top 20 CD's and that is THE TEN BEST OF JACKIE GLEASON,buy that first"
3,Worth it for song Five,"Erland Oye makes his solo debut with this album. Fans of his Kings Of Convienience days will most likely enjoy this album. I totally dig his voice and the mellow tone to it. You may recognize him from tracks off the Royksopp album. All in all this album has quite a disco thump which is a little too loud and flamboyant for me, yet it is unique. I could have hoped for a little more of a downtempo vibe from oye. Yet song five, ""every party"" is spectacular- and makes the purchase worth it."
5,Music for the new generation,"I am the old school guy. I don't like change. I love the Led Zeppelin track over anything the common sound on the radio.That said, give this a chance. This is really good stuff. Beats with good vocals. If you hate Moby, you will like this. It's traditional music with a touch of modern life. Home run. This is the Who of the new generation."
4,Certainly not unlistenable,"I've been surprised by Erlend Oye's transformation from Simon & Garfunkelesque indie popster into a sort-of electronica DJ-type. But it's been a pleasant surprise. I'm surprised, of course, that I'm pleasantly surprised, but that's a rather pleasant sensation as well.On the whole this album is quite nice and the decision to produce tracks in many countries in Europe and the US was well-concieved; it gives the album an ephemeral cosmopolitanism, as if the listener were shuttled around with Oye to these various locations along with the accompanying sense of dislocation and disassociation.The album is reminiscent of ""Off the Wall"" or Kraftwerk, and is of an uneven quality, probably due to the many different producers. I must admit I'm disappointed Royksopp didn't make an appearance, unless they remixed the hidden track. Well, good stuff regardless."
4,Fun stuff,"The concept is great: 10 songs written in different locations with 10 different electronic acts. If you are familiar with Kings of Convenience, most likely, you will be pleasantly surprised with the results. While the album is far from sounding like Kings of Convenience (well, maybe it sounds a bit like Versus at times), it still retains that certain Erlend-ness and builds upon it. The CD is catchy with an infectious 80's vibe resurfacing throughout; it's very danceable, diverse, and creative. Oye has a unique vocal delivery and continues to establish himself as a pop-music wizard. Sometimes his approach grows a little tiresome, as on the particularly bland 'Every Party Has A Winner and A Loser,' but every song on here deserves a listen. Overall, it is a more than acceptable substitute for a new KOC album."
4,Great Fun!,"Fans of the 90's synth-pop sound from bands like Frazier Chorus or ABC (particularly their now OOP CD ""Abracadabra"") will love this effort from Erlend Oye. Much more reminiscent of the that time period than the 80's. This is a simply delightful album to listen to."
1,"""Best of the James Bond Themes""?...only the titles","This by far the worst of the renditions of the Bond themes. First, all of the performers (I can't call them singers), sound worse than the worst (aka cheeziest) Las Vegas lounge act. And since I live in Vegas, you can believe me when I say this. Second, the orchestrations are horrific. Third, there are some songs that don't even exist in the movies! This waste of time and energy is good for one thing...a big LAUGH! If you get together with your fellow hardcore Bond fans and play this CD, get drunk and laugh for hours. This is a pathetic effort to cash in on Bond."
3,Now Made in China,"These do the job but are now made in China, all Gilmour products used to be made in the USA until a couple years ago. They still have the lifetime warranty."
3,For Review,"The book was somewhat parochial. It was written over a decade ago, and some of the information is outdated. However, it would be a good resource for pre and early adolescent age youth. Some ideas and referrals were useful."
5,This thing is crazy!,"I have to start off by saying... I laughed when I opened the box and saw this knife. Aside from it looking totally bad-to-the-bone, this thing is gigantic. It's actually comparable to the biggest kitchen knife I have. This is one very sweet and very sharp (cut my arm a little bit testing how sharp it is) knife. One benefit I think no one else mentioned is that you can switch the belt clip from a righty to a lefty. It normally don't bother me to use a righty knife as I am a lefty and used to everything being for righties. Anyways, Ka-Bar is the best. Buy this!"
5,Awesome!,"This knife is pretty big, much bigger than I thought. But it's awesome! Very sharp, very durable. I used it as a hammer today and not even a scratch!"
1,More Junk made in China,"The plastic piece broke on mine in a few months,,,,,,suppossed to be HEAVY DUTY.....??Why can't someone in the US design somthing good."
4,"Twisted, Noisy, Apocalyptic, Catchy?","Too start with, this CD is certainly not for those who can't enjoy noise. It's very very noisy. There's tons of hiss, and the tunes are not readily discernable for the most part. However, lying behind the hiss and the trebly, light-speed drum beats, there are some nice, occassionally sweet and ambient tones laid down. Yellow Swans' Pete Swanson and Gabriel Mindel Saloman know how to manipulate chaos to their liking, and their loose structures provide plenty of room for sonic experimentation. If you like your music ""out,"" then you might just dig this. It may seem dense at first, but repeated listenings can lend completely different experiences, and ultimately reveal a layered approach that frequently makes something out of nothing."
4,easy access for updating,"Brief and objective way to keep updated in general clinics. It is probably one of the best ways to keep updated, when working specificaly in a defined field. As an otolaryngologist, it is always a good source of information in other fields. The chapter of AIDS and HIV, gets longer every year. The first time I read it, it was in 1983 with few pages related to it, and now the chapter has pages and pages, enough for a non AIDS/HIV specialist (I hope!)."
4,More than adequate.,"This music stand was very easy to assemble, and is very sturdy. It serves it's purpose well, and at a good price."
5,Great stand at a great price,"I would definitely recommend this music stand. Here's why:- It's got a very large desk section that can hold tons more than the average music stand- It's very secure and sturdy - it never gets wobbly even when loaded down with tons of music- It looks very nice and is very durable- It's got a lock knob - which is much better than a standard music stand, where the mechanics holding it up will wear out eventually. This stand will stay in place forever because of the lock knob.- It's a really great deal. Comparably-priced stands in music stores are cheap and flimsy. This one is professional both in appearance and in quality."
2,Barely OK...,"I bought the German version and unfortunately the pronunciation is lacking. Almost all the characters sound like they are talking with something in their mouths. The sound quality is horrible and the videos are terrible to watch. They are not interesting. I think it is way way over priced for what is contained inside and the quality of it. The videos are boring and my son would not even bother watching them...and when he did, he complained. I would try another way to teach your kids another language."
1,Very Disappointing,"We all know (especially van damme fans) these movies are bought for one purpose: the fight scenes. Not only does this movie have horrible fights, they are too far in between and hardly involve any classic van damme hand to hand combat. The first fight, actually, the first scuffle i should say was like 2 punches and the guy went down. The last fight suffered from some of the worst editing and slow motion i have ever seen in a movie. I actually got dizzy watching it. Please dont waste money on this like I did. Save it for Kumite which should be what us van damme vans have been waiting for,"
3,An alright Damme Movie,"I have been a Van Damme fan for years, I own all his movies but anyway to the review.The movie takes place as Van Damme being a commander and is to protect the president against a group of terrorist. They hide out in a ambassy and try to fend off the terrorists. While the Van Damme I was grown up to see isnt the same, this is why it got the rating it did. He doesnt use his martial arts any longer and is basically gun action. The movie is a great movie exspecially if you liked tears of the sun and any other modern war movie. I dont want to give off any spoilers here, but I would recommend renting before buying this movie only because if your thinking of watching any of Van Damme martial arts you will hardly see any.But overall once again an ok average movie, could have been worse but could have been better if Van Damme were to fight more."
3,Second in Command 2006,"Not one of VanDamme better movies, thought is was lacking in action for him it just seemed to be out of character for him."
2,Van Damme is the star,"This movie is okay to watch one time but it's not worth purchasing. The movie starts out with Van Damme being called a tough guy and as usual he gets the girl. It's all fiction.Van Damme, who got his claim to fame from the movie Bloodsport, only got into 2 fights in this movie. The rest of the movie is basically him commanding other people to do what he says. He doesn't talk firm; he just talks with a constant low tone with no firmness all throughout the movie. It's other characters that talk firm to him. This movie is basically mostly all talk for Van Damme and not much fighting."
2,WHO GIVES A VAN DAMME?,"Being an ""older"" person myself, I certainly have no objections to fading action stars still trying to maintain their youthful exuberance. Dolph Lundgren. Harrison Ford. Steven Segal. Chuck Norris. These guys all look great, but they just don't have that energetic persona they became famous for. And now Van Damme surfaces in this by the books action film set (where else?) in Romania, the country where making films must be enormously cheaper than anywhere else. The country is having a civilian uprising after their recent elections and good old JC is sent in to ensure the safety of the new president. There's lots of gunfire and betrayals, etc., and the formula is so tired it doesn't really manage to thrill this viewer."
1,"OK, Not really worth it.","The game is a one timer. Best for rental. The action is ok the first time around but gets old.It isnt much of a challenge at all. Easily beaten in 6 hours.I found that the puzzles were simple and rather stupid. You run back and forth on a train you are trying to keep from making its destination ,and ,you always encounter a baddy in the same exact spot you met the first one you killed. The card keys are annoying to keep seperated and the game has terrible camera angles and graphics. The storyline also reminded me of Under Siege 2. The background music is fairly displeasing(extremely annoying). I sat there playing the game hoping it would evolve but it [didn't]. I dont mean to be angular, but i wish i hadnt bought it. This is just my opinion, but i suggest you take the advice. RENT FIRST.(cant find it ,dont bother.)"
2,Awful,"I bought this thinking it would be something like Resident Evil but it turned out awful. The camera angle is often akward, and it seems like your going through the same train car the entire game. DON'T BUY!"
1,AWFUL!! Stinks..,"I bought this game with the intention of enjoying a great espionage/covert thriller. Instead, I got a game that had horrible camera angles, clunky controls and a monotonous environment-It ain't Syphon Filter, thats for sure-Save your money-I'm trading this in for something else!"
2,"No ""boom"" in this box","I bought this on a friday and returned it a few days later. Very nice to look and and alot of good features like the MP3 capability, but extremely poor audio makes for a big disappointment. Despite the claims of ""Deep, rich bass"" made by the manufacturer, the unit has a low volume that maxes out at 29. The extra bass button and jazz, classic, and rock settings make very little difference in the sound. It's definitely meant to be kept indoors inside a quiet room because I seriously doubt it could be heard outdoors, or in a noisy environment. This would be a good deal if JVC had installed better sound capabilities."
3,Not Dual Cassette.,"Note to those who are expecting a dual cassette unit, as this boombox is described in its listing--this has a single cassette only. The sound quality for CDs is somewhat acceptable (for a small boombox) at medium to higher volumes, but it is annoyingly ""tinny"" at lower volumes. On the other hand, it does offer lots of MP3 features (not tried by me)."
5,Excellent!,"I was looking for a boombox for my son for Christmas, and ran onto this one. It was around the same price as others that didn't have MP3 capabilities, so I gave it a shot. I was very pleased whenever I received it. It is a very impressive looking boombox and sounds great."
3,Of limited use,"If you want a boot to muck around in on rainy or muddy days, these are for you. However, they are heavy and clunky and sometimes make squishing noises. Since they are not leather, they also don't breath. I would only wear them on days when I didn't want to ruin any of the boots that I love."
2,disappointed,"The fabric on the dress was cheap, and I had to sew parts of the skirt on to the top. It was VERY wrinkled, and could not be ironed. I had a little success using a dry cleaning sheet in the dryer. Regarding the wings...what a challenge! The ugly white elastic straps that hold them on are not visible in the photo. The top portion of the wings would not stay up even for a second, and just flopped over onto the bottom portion. I took me an entire day to sew reinforcing velcro onto both the wings and dress straps to hold the wings up."
1,Doesn't wear like the photo shows-,"I thought this costume looked really cute on the model but the wings have a white elastic band that goes over the front of each shoulder. It would not look so bad if the elasic bands were black or beige but white really shows up and just does not look right. The only way you can hide the elastic is to cut them off - they will not tuck under the dress.Also, this costume is about a size three even though it says it will fit up to a size 12."
5,Mesmerizing,"I have just returned home from seeing Peter Kater and Nawang Khechog perform at Carnegie Hall on behalf of the Tibet House Benefit Concert in this Year of the Earth Hare. I was mesmerized by the beauty of Kater's New Age-y keyboards combined with the lyrical and moving Tibetan Long Horn of Khechog- a truly unusual and unique pairing!I feel fortunate to have had my eyes opened to this duo and look forward to hearing The Dance of The Innocents for many years to come.I also wish Nawang well as he continues in his pursuit of teaching the world about the plight of his people- how lucky the Tibetans are to have such a talented and deeply spiritual artist pulling for them (and how lucky we are, too)."
2,The Firm,"The DVD arrived in a timely fashion and was in perfect condition. On watching the DVD though, the instructor was terribly thin and overactive. There was no real preparation for a beginner. I donated it."
3,not bad,"If you like step areobics, you will like this DVD. Christa Riley is the instructor and she is actually SCARY skinny, doesn't even look healthy. But beyond that this is a pretty good workout. I appreciate that they move through quickly and don't take a lot of time explaining every move."
3,Pretty good workout,"This is a pretty good workout. Like many of the Firm workouts, I don't particularly care for some of her cardio or step exercises, but other than that it's a pretty good workout."
3,Be careful!!!!,"I am a very advanced exerciser and have used the Firm dvd tapes extensively over the past months. The problem of the firm series if overuse of muscles. If you own the body sculpting system, you are basically weight training and doing the same lunges and squats every day if you rotate the videos as you are supposed to. The instructors do not explain proper form and the cardio is not that great. If you have knee or back problems, DO NOT BUY THIS SYSTEM!!! The ab routines are stupid and downright uncomfortable on this box. Get Tae Bo and/or Denise Austin for a better workout."
4,Good intermediate to advance workout.,"For a complete review, see ""Lovesbooks"" review below. She is absolutely correct that the sound mixing on this DVD is terrible. It is extremely difficult to hear Christa Riley. Regardless, the DVD is probably, for the ones issued for the incline box (not for the Transfirmer), the best of the series. Although you do not get your heart rate pumping, there is a nice blend of the exercises as they do seem to flow from one to the other. I have noticed that on the DVDs issued with the Transfirmer, that they are somewhat jerky in their flow. There are not as many compound movements as that on Total Body Shaping with Stephanie Huckabee, so it makes for a great end of the cycle workout. You will need 5-12 pound weights, an incline box or Transfirmer, and some manner in which to stay on the incline when doing the ab work."
2,Blech,"I like and respect the Firm series, but this DVD is overly complicated, with lots of weird, fast moves on on the bench-thingy. I'd say skip this one; there are plenty of other great Firm dvds."
1,Dont Buy,Two uses and there are holes in the tips of the fingers. the whole point of these gloves were to protect his fingers!
1,Never received,"I was excited to be able to order this book as I needed it for a program I am giving. It was ordered through Hastings and never arrived, and I had no success reaching their customer service. I have cancelled payment on my credit card."
1,This book is a joke,"This book is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, there are scams involving vitamins, but there are con artists in EVERY industry/profession. Many of their arguments are illogical and/or just plain silly. The authors are clearly very biased, and, ironically (though not to my surprise), they provide no scientific references from the literature to support their claims. Further, the argument that vitamins pills would grow on trees if we needed them is an example of their illogical and unreasonable nature. Fortunately doctors like Herbert don't grow on trees; for if they did, we would surely be comdemned to a life of mediocre health. Herbert, with his perpetual campaign against nutritional supplements, is doing humans a disservice in an age of a degraded food supply and overwhelming evidence that nutrients can prevent and treat disease."
1,Extreme bias and total lack of objectivity,"Stephen Barrett aka 'quackbuster' has an agenda against pretty much everything outside the established medical industry. His group has been backed by big drug companies, has launched malicious lawsuits (all of which they have lost by the way). His bias is so conspicuous and his opinions so lacking in fact and objectivity that nothing he writes is to be believed. To attack vitamins where the cost is low, substantial benefits have been proven in trials and toxicity is virtually non-existant is ludicrous. Especially when you consider that the conventional medical industry which Barrett and his gang represent is one of the leading causes of death in the USA (over 100,000 annual deaths caused by prescribed drugs alone), it is even more laughable."
1,An axe to grind,These authors clearly have an axe to grind. What is sad is the disservice that is done through the spreading of such wrong headed advice.
1,Skeptical,"I'm going to give this a read just to see what he has to say. However, it's strange that the only healthy elderly people I know (people between say 75 and 95) eat a balanced diet, take supplements, and REFUSE to take perscription drugs. I plan to follow in their footsteps."
1,Did not receive the right edition!,"Well, the picture and description said it would be the 5th edition, but I received an ANCIENT 2nd edition! It is nearly obsolete for the course I am taking, and will likely have to end up going to the book store to buy the correct edition. So, basically a total waste of my money!"
5,Great product. Great price,"We just had a hurricane in NYC. The cover battled the rain, wind and kept my motorcycle dry. If you need an all weather cover for your motorcycle then this is the one."
4,Dowco Guardian Cover for Sport Bikes,"Fit perfect over my 2011 GSXR 600. Not super snug, but just right. Looks like it might leave black marks on the white contact points on my bike. I think I&#699;ll cut up and glue a microfiber cloth to the contact points, just to avoid the hassle of wiping it off all the time. Bought the bike from someone who had an older Dowco cover, and it DID leave little black marks at contact points. It did wipe off though. All in all, it fit well and looks like a sturdy cover."
5,A very well made cover.,"I have a small cruiser-style bike, a Suzuki GZ250. The fit for my bike is a little odd – I'm wondering if this cover is meant for street bikes. It covers the bike just fine, but the handlebars in particular don't seem to line up with where the cover wants them to be. That being said, it is definitely the best-made and sturdiest cover I've ever owned. The material is heavier than most covers I've used, but not too bulky. The stitching seems very solid and the whole thing really looks like it will last for a long time. I've gone through a number of cheaper covers and they all seem to fall apart after about six months. I've only had this cover for two months, but I'm confident that it will hold up much better. I'm rating it five stars despite the minor fit issues (which could be unique to my bike) because of the quality of the construction. Definitely recommended!"
4,A nice read,"I thought the book was captivating. I read the entire book in one sitting. Rhett's charector was developed well and her attempt at self discovery was thought provoking. Her relationships with her lovers and with her mother were well directed. However, I felt that the dialogue was a bit over done and overall, it was a bit predictible."
4,fun for some hours,"my son is 3 and he loved, he wanted to do it all in one day! the only problem is that then it was over!!! but we still read it."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this for my son. He enjoyed it but, I was disappointed in what you got for the price I paid. The book was a meager 8 pages and the stickers did not stick very well. They kept falling off the pages. For a price of $6.99 I didn't feel it was worth it."
1,Very disappointed!!,I have to agree with another reviewer regarding this sticker book. I wish I had read the reviews better. For the price of $6.99 there is nothing in this book. I think my step-grandson will like it but I don't. There is nothing to this so-called book. There are a lot of stickers but I was expecting more. I was planning on giving this as part of his Christmas gift but I feel like I will be cheating him if I give him this. It is not much of a gift. I will have to pay attention to other reviewers and pay closer attention to what I am ordering.
1,"Sticker book with ""stickers"" that do not stick?","I would not call this a ""sticker book"" - this is simply a very short book with a couple of spreads with pictures, which were made to look like stickers. These ""pictures"" do not stick to the pages, so I am not sure how the name ""sticker book""applies in this case. I gave this product one star because my son enjoys the pictures, anyway."
1,Weak plastic,I installed the this fitting at the end of my hose and tested it. The first couple times it leaked so I tightend the screws a little each time. Before the screws ever got tight enough to stop the leaking they pulled through the top portion of the screw hole. I had to buy a metal fitting of a different design.
3,Variations,"Unfortunately most Americans will buy the Simple Things Remixes expecting to get more music like Simple Things. This is not how a remix works.The only other downbeat artist appearing on this CD is Richard Dorfmeister, and his is the least provocative of the tracks. Photek was most famous for his drum n bass work but is recently been making house, and Roni Size is the famous dnb hero.But ignoring US expectations and judging these tracks on their own merit the Roni Size remix was quite spectacular and fastbeat, what you'd expect. The photek remix is beautifully simple and minimalist.A nice CD but not vital; and since it's a US release it's probably important to reiterate that it is NOT downbeat."
2,A Grand Mess in C Minor,"Sorry... this performance of Mozart's Grand Mass in C Minor wasn't very good.The chorus plowed through this difficult score, but was weak at times, and violins were not blended well... but the soloists were the worst part, especially the male soloists. The bass was a rank amateur and the tenor sang several wrong notes. I should have listened to more examples before I bought this CD. It was more of a Mess in C Minor than Mozart's masterpiece..."
4,can a brother get some fervor?,"not her best stuff, but it's solid. the tracks with tony scherr on guitar (sunday morning in particular) are great. what a tasteful guitar player. not to metion that studying stones is as good a song as she's ever written. i usually like her poems, and although the one on this album (parameters)was effectively creepy, to quote josh baskin, ""i don't get it."" as a result of this, along with the lack of political indictments and/or fervor, or a least an attempt to rally the troops for the coming labor war, i'm taking away a star and i'm not gonna give it back until someone makes with the fervor."
1,Overated,"Ani is really overated. If she ever goes on American Idol, she won't even make the 1st round. Any Amercian Idol can outsing her anytime and I'm sure Simon can really say something bad about her vocals. Her voice is really sub-par. Her lyrics are so self-indulgent. Her guitar playing is OK but gets boring. I was so disappointed with her CD. I find it so boring after listening 2 minutes into the CD. Her music and lyrics are not memorable at all. What a waste of money. If you heard of Ani through the media and want to buy her CD - just don't. Save your money and listen to tons of singer/songwriters out there."
1,not good,"This effort, I have to say, is simply not good. I used to like Difranco's stuff quite a bit, but something's missing here, and it's a substantial enough problem that it compromises the entire work.On a side note, I must defend porterhouse from lucibuis' attack. First, it's not like porterhouse is off the mark. The comments about the music notwithstanding (with which I happen to agree, at least concerning this album, but that's beside the point), all porterhouse did was call it like he or she saw it. Honestly, any objective observer couldn't really disagree. But what is truly absurd is Lucibuis' hypocrisy. Lucibuis purports to give us all a lesson about what makes a great American citizen and why Difranco is just that, right after calling for Amazon to censor porterhouse. Nice. I guess it's good old fashioned stuff like liberty and free speech, but only for those with whom you agree, right Lucibuis? Twisted."
2,"Good Lyrics, Abysmal 'Singing'.","I just saw Ani DiFranco live the other night, but I went for her opening act, Erin McKeown. The two have the obvious parallel of skilled guitar playing and a folkish sound (though DiFranco's on the deep end of it.) The problem is that, like McKeown, DiFranco can serve up some good lyrics...but unlike the skilled McKeown, Ani Difranco simply cannot sing. The whole time at the show - and on this disc - she just talks very fast in a sing-song voice over skilled guitar playing, but that's not deserving of attention at all. Lots of personality, but that can't compensate for her ""singing"". She'd make a good background guitarist providing backing vocals maybe, but she can't fill up the center of a stage."
4,"different, but i love it!","this one is pretty different in my opinion, but defenteley not bad.there is more songs about her feelings, as far as relationships, i think than others in the past, but the songs are really quite beautiful. plus, there are still the exceptions that arent just about ani's love at the time. her voice sounds great on this one too, and overall, its just...grand.the only song i usually dont listen to is seeing eye dog. i dont know, the music and everything, i dont hate, but i defenteley dont like very much.so, all i have left to say is i love this cd just as much as some of her others."
3,"Not my favorite, but still a fan!","I'm surprised I feel so differently about this album than most of the other reviewers! I guess what I really love about Ani is her ability to take a simple melody, add a bunch of different instrumentals, creative lyrics, her emotional voice, some really unique chords and key changes and turn it into something complex, but not grating. I felt like only 2 songs on this album did that: Studying Stones and Paradigm. The rest of the tracks, I just didn't enjoy listening to because I didn't like the melodies. I don't have all of her albums (I have 8, I think) but this is the first one where I don't absolutely love at least 2/3 of the songs. But I'm still glad I bought it and supported her label and her music!"
2,Not quite there yet.,"The PalmPix is compact and light weight. The price is good and the idea is great. But unfortunately the picture quality is not quite there. The picture on the palm is almost unusable, but once you hotsync (which takes longer than advertised) is still is not a very good quality picture. Not much detail. I am not sure what application or situation this product would work for, but I think I will wait till next year -- hopefully the technology will be better. This year I am sending back the Palm Pix"
2,Disappointing performance,"The camera will not take an acceptable picture under incandescent lighting - it will generate a very red image. Even out of doors, the image is badly blurred around the edges; only the middle half of the image is sharp. The ""preview image"" (ie the viewfinder) is very blocky and in grey only, making it hard to recognize where the camera is pointing. The display of images after they have been taken uses a very poor color mapping - much worse than what the Palm IIIc is capable of."
1,being forgotten as so often,"Exactly what I was looking for.... I thought. A non-weight non-volume camera for ad-hoc situations, no high quality required. How disapointing to read the specs and find out Mac users can shake it as with too many other products...."
4,Solid debut from a Memphis Band,"Johnny Romania's debut cd, ""popchaser,"" is a refreshing mix of pop, rock, and electronica. Heavy on the synthesisers, the album creates an ambient mood, yet, at the same time, does not fall into the cliche' of pop/electronic as many albums lately have. Johnny Romania's sound is distinctly their own. Musical hightlights include the spacy ""my love is true"" (complete with Radiohead sample), ""taking from the stars"" (borrowing from New Wave and punk influences), and ""let you down."" With ""popchaser,"" Johnny Romania have established themselves as force to be reckoned with, not only on the Memphis music scene, but on the music scene as a whole."
5,good stuff,"""popchaser"" is a good bit of electro/pop madness, at different times sounding like 80's new wave, straight-ahead indie rock, and pure 90's electronica. recommended if you like any of that stuff."
3,Definitely worth reading,"For those who are looking at how to have a better prayer life, this book provides some excellent thoughts. In some ways I'd consider it ""light reading,"" but in other ways not. Granted, it is easy to get through; but the author brings forth some deep thoughts that are worthy of meditating on. It is also a good book to pass along to those who are struggling spiritually as it gives them food for thought."
3,Keeps rolling down,"It was comfortable and gave my stomach a smooth look. Not as firm and tight as other products I've tried, however, it did help in the smoothing department. Don't expect to lose one dress size wearing this, but it gives nice control. Unfortunately, it rolls and bunches on top, especially after sitting down. Therefore, expect to adjust it many times while wearing it. The bunches are noticeable! This item would be GREAT if it would stay up and not roll down.Another qualm, the panty is not seamless, therefore it will show through clothing. Try getting a thong version, if needed.Other than that,the material is very comfortable to wear, even for long periods. I don't have to worry about sucking in my stomach. :)"
2,NOT worth it.,"This is my first shapewear experience and I was excited. I just wanted to smooth out my stomach and give a little lift to my butt. I'm young and I'm not particularly big, so this was more insurance for more form-fitting dresses, because I've always had a lower belly bump. There is no way this product would not leave pantylines unless you are made of pure muscle in your thigh/butt area. You can tell as soon as you open it up and see these pronounced elastic bands. It flattens out the stomach somewhat, but not flawlessly. I was not impressed with that aspect. I am returning it immediately so I have nothing to contribute as far as how it wears throughout the day. The fabric is comfortable, though."
2,It divides your hips,The picture shown it's on a side because it doesn't want to show you that the product divides your hips and thighs. When you put your clothes on you can see the division..not attractive!
5,The game is great compared to any other basketball game,"like i said above it is better than any basketball game for any system.Great fun,graphics, and features.I own nba2k and I LOVED it.Then i heard only great things about nba2k1 so i bought it.It is great!! Street ball is so fun.Anybody who likes nba2k or basketball buy nba2k1 ...."
4,Better graphics. More options. Not quite as good as 2K.,"Pros----Great graphicsTons of optionsThe announcers can say certain names of created players.Cons----Play by play and commentator isn't as good as 2KWeak AI (computer controlled players spend alot of time out at the three point line when they have the ball, even if they have an open drive to the hoop. they wait until there are a few seconds left on the shot clock, and then pop it up.)Verdict-------It's pretty good. For the price, I'd say get it. I haven't played 2K2 so I can't compare 2K1 to it. All I can do is compare it to 2K. Compared to 2K, it falls a little short. That's not to say it's a bad game, it just has a few short commings."
2,Who dropped the ball on this one?,These Sega Sports games all suffer from the same problem: they rely on looks and not on gameplay. This game is repetitive drivel and I can't find a reason for recommending it. So I won't.
2,"great Chants, terrible chanters","While I know Chant is not a professional field, per se, the vocal quality--particularly on the lead cantor on these CDs--is horrible. Having said that, there is a great selection of chants, including numerous hymns and sequences the average choir might sing, rather than the typical selection of propers that only a true schola will tackle. If considered for aesthetic purposes, I would not recommend this set. There are also background organs on the chants, which might offend Chant purists."
4,Excellent History,"Marxist historian Christopher Hill gives us a lucid and thoroughly researched account of the English civil war and the radical revolutionary movements that followed in the mid-seventeenth century. Born during this period of history was the Protestant ethic, the value of individualism in man's relation to God and society. We also witness many political movements calling for egalitarianism (prefiguring Marx and socialist theory) and several variants of libertarian socialism (albeit with Christianity thrown in the mix). This work of history captures the radical breakdown of the traditional family structure, the decentralization of discourse through the printing press, and the breakdown of England's long lasting monarchy. A must read for any student of revolution and political theory."
4,Basic Diabetes & Supplement Treatment,"Written in 1999, this book provides a good basic overview of diabetes, vitamins, minerals,& herbs and their influence on Diabetes.. Some information on sweeteners is outdated e.g. ""Splenda is in such great demand that it is only available from Johnson & Johnson internet website (www.sucralose.com)for adult diabetics.""I'd buy again or recommend as a reference for those interested in a more natural approach to diabetes control."
2,diabetes improvement,"There just wasn't much here that I hadn't already read on the internet. It does have several supplement choices that claim to help with blood sugar and since I bought a used book, it was worth the price. You can find the supplements inexpensively at [...]. And no, I am not employed by Swanson. You may find other great discount sites."
2,Comment on the reviews,Reviews written using undefined abbreviations are simply useless to any reader who is unfamiliar with what can be appropriately called jargon. e.g. a few will claim they understand the abbreviation USA represents United States of America but most have started claiming they are far from being United. What about the new borns who have never heard of or never want to know of USA. What the devil is KPX katapillx tell me more you yankee boys.
3,"Useful Info, but not much new","This was an interesting review of dietary factors that have a demonstrated effect on controlling your blood sugar.I have had Type II Diabetes for over 20 years and it is largely controlled by diet, exercise and Resveratrol. The best and most effective I have found is at http://resveratrol10.com. It has not only lowered my blood sugar to 110 -120, but my cholesterol is down to just 128 from over 150.I live near the beach just south of San Francisco and walk my Giant Irish Wolfhounds 10+ miles a week for exercise. Resveratrol has also pumped up my energy level so I can walk farther in less time.Overall, I would recommend this book as a good introduction of things you can do to take back control of your health,Gregory Collinswww.GregoryCollins.name"
3,Decent Basic Primer,"Some good info on vitamins and minerals ( chromium, magnesium, vanadium ) and necessary fats ( DHA, EPA GLA ) that are essential but outdated information particularly on some food choices. My understanding is that bagels are terrible for diabetics yet he recommends them. I have some doubts about other facts only because he states the average American eats 756 doughnuts annually !! That's more than 2 per day, every day for a year. I don't know that I've ever met anyone, including cops, who eat two doughnuts a day, every day. While I see good, solid info here, repeated in other journals about diabetic health, I am suspect of any info someone provides after seeing a statistic like that."
5,"""In the Valley of Elah""","This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. I was left speechless and was overcome with emotion. Jonathan Tucker is one of my favorite actors so I had been waiting for this movie to come out for a while, but hadn't realized it was based on a true story. This is a movie that you can't tell people about, it is one you need to see for yourself because of how it makes you feel in the end. You feel like you know these people. You feel like you are a part of what is going on, like you are there with them. It is so easily related to. At this point in time we all know a soldier and we all worry about them. This is a movie that shows you some of the real things that happen to soldiers and what they go through, because of this, I think the emotions people feel while watching this are real, not something Hollywood creates for us like most sad movies."
2,Feels cookie cutter and predictable.,"I feel I've seen this movie before, somtime in the 1980s...yes..it starred Tom Cruise as a young JAG defense attorney and Jack Nicholson....only then it was fresh. This is basically the same movie, but replace court room drama and suspense with detective drama and suspense and replace the ""code red"" stuff with current Iraq themed war time moral debates. The whole thing feels very canned but good acting and some decent suspense make it watchable, but that is all, just watchable not recommendable."
2,GOOD PERFOMANCES CAN'T SAVE THIS OVERLY LONG DRAMA!,"'In The Valley Of Elah is an interesting story with good perfomances by Jones, Sarandon and Theron, but the film's snail pace had me wanting to fast forward at times. Although the story is interesting and sad, showing that war destroys more than the obvious. It's not like we haven't seen this stuff before and I felt like I knew where it was going long before the end of the movie. It's an OK watch about a 2 1/2 star rating, but it's really nothing new."
2,Unclear,"This is a dishonest film that suggests all military in combat can return home, still kill someone and, immediately after the deed, satisfy a hungry stomach. It makes no attempt to convey the idea that most combat service people, dealing with serious emotional issues, don't embrace this sort of attitude and conduct. The film also suggests that this is an issue unique to the situation in Iraq. All military, in all countries, in all wars have members who committed such acts. If you're going to protest the war in Iraq, through a screenplay, do so addressing the issues pertaining to this war. If you feel that the soldiers are victims, say it more clearly than how it is done in this screenplay. I say this as a Liberal Democrat. ""In the Valley of Elah"" is as narrow and dishonest, in its information, as John Wayne's Right Wing ""The Green Beret."" The war in Iraq is too complex to try to squeeze your opposition to it into a script about a homicide investigation."
2,Anti military,This movie has some good performances but it is very difficult to watch. If you are looking for insights on wars effects on people skip this movie. It is a very one-sided view that all soldiers are monsters and that the army is the devil. It was a little hard to buy Theron as a cop.
3,Power of the Media,"This film is solid in terms of acting and direction. The story is exciting and well constructed. But the film subtly projects a message (subtle in that it is hidden in Tommy Lee Jones's quest to solve his son's murder) that our soldiers in Iraq are self-destructive psychos with no moral fiber. War is, indeed, hell. But it does take two to fight, another truism. It is very easy to criticize when all seems to be secure; our soldiers are fighting to protect our security. The main thing that I got out of this taut drama is that the media can manipulate our sentiments. When Jones flew the flag at the end, I thought he was going to fly it the proper way to honor his son. I was surprised."
3,Another anti-war movie,"Really good performances here. Tommy, Charlize and briefly, Susan Sarandon, my favorite left-wing liberal cuckoo girl! The story isn't all that much. Nothing really original here. Most of the recent spate of ""anti-war"" movies aren't really anti-war at all, because liberals have never actually cared about Americans dying in a foreign country for no real reason, which is what is happening now in Afghanistan and Iraq. These liberal made movies are really about the fact that there is a Republican in the White House and they want one of their own, which they will surely have for better or worse, by next year. This is really a B-grade movie, except for the star power. I will watch just about anything with a combo like Tommy Lee and Charlize. Too bad they didn't have something better to work with."
5,Excellent film!,This is such a powerful and moving film. The story is so heartbreaking but one that all Americans should see.
4,Tommy Lee is real.,"Tommy Lee gives another oustanding performance. I can't decide which performance I would rate higher, but another solid movie to add to his list."
3,"Pretty good, but...","I thought this movie was well written and acted, but I found the resolution of the murder to be a bit unsatisfying and incomplete."
4,Valley of Elah,"a slow and twisting plot line. excellent acting. original story. no real surprises, but the actors work very well together and the movie reveals itself. too intense for children, but a great movie with very little real war footage."
1,Anti-Military Propaganda,"How disappointing. ""In the Valley of Elah"" turned out to be a piece of anti-military propaganda. The message is that the military takes sweet young men and turns them into drug-addicted, torturing, cold-blooded murders, and then covers it up. Tommy Lee Jones can sure act...I just wish he wouldn't waste his chops on films like this."
1,Pure anti-Bush movie,"Right in, just for elections!!!I question myself why I even watched that movie...Weak and inconsistent story line,bah there is really no story just smearing american soldiers seems sole purpose that movie was made for!!!!Good part there was very little mrs Sarandon present.Mr Jones is getting very old tired and his acting is more like a robot than a human.Dont waste your money I can send you my disk if you must see it I am not watching that movie again in my lifetime,if you suport your troops don't ""bring it home"""
1,A truely dishonest portrayal of the war,"This movie depicts our returning servicemen as murderous, torturing, drug addicts (the military drug tests all the time) to a man. Then tells us a patriotic former Vietnam Vet, who still makes up his motel bed with hospital corners and spit shines his shoes, ends up dishonoring his country by flying an Iraq battle flag his son fought under, upside down as an international sign of distress at a public building. I understand the right to free speech. Conning moviegoers into paying to hear such dishonest trash is another matter. I want my money back!"
2,just okay,I agree with the previous reviewer. This wooden sword was okay. I wanted the color represented but instead it was a much darker walnut color. Also it isn't that comfortable. In the future I think I would prefer to buy one that has a corded wrap. Oh I also hate the way it was shipped. In a smushed up box with holes in it with no foam or protective padding. I'm surprised it wasn't chipped or dented more than it already was. I bought 2 a shot and long one and they hit up against each other in the mail. I don't mind the denting so much since I like the look of aged and worn wood. It seemed like someone just found a box and threw it in there. Overall I can't reccomend it. Search else where or buy one in person if you can.
1,disappointing,"I had high hopes for this little camera but it just ate up the batteries. On a test to see how many photos I could take to use up the memory stick, I ran out of juice before I could find out. Not only did it eat up the regular batteries, it only lasted for 15 shots with the rechargables. I kept the ""live"" feature off but kept the reviewing feature on. It still ate up the batteries. I'm sending it back. bummer...."
1,Piece of Junk,I purchased this camera a few days ago. The picture quality is very poor and the camera stoped working after 3 days. I figured out the camera is actually a Chinese brand relabeled with a Kodak name. Be careful. Stick with a Sony or OLympus.
5,I love this camera!,"I really love this camera. My sister bought a, Kodak EasyShare 3200 digital camera, 2 years ago and paid more than I did for this camera, plus I have more features than hers does for less money! My main caution is watch the dock you buy for this camera. I bought the EasyShare camera dock 6000 II for this camera and it does not work with this camera. On the Kodak web site said this EashShare dock 6000 II works with the DX and CX digital cameras and on the box for the dock II. The only dock that works with the CX6230 is the EasyShare camera dock 6000."
1,The Dock is a hassle,"Since purchasing this camera as a Christmas present for my family, the Dock has never worked right. The camera doesn't sit right in it and doesn't charge. The power cord from the Dock to the wall only works on certain outlets. I'd rate the camera better if I actually used it more than twice, but its rechargeable battery is always dead. I can't tell which features are good or not. I'm disappointed and spent almost $200 for the bundled items."
4,Addictive power metal from Finland!,"'Mask of Damnation' is the second album from Finnish band Requiem, recorded in 2003. This is a consistent album which grows on you with every listen, the musicianship is tight, arrangements are intricate and the sound is both powerful and melodic. There is not a weak song on the entire album. Requiem have a very original (and slightly quirky!) musical style, and one that I admire. Check out the first song 'Blinded' on Youtube, if you like that you'll like the rest of the album. Recommended."
3,TimeSaver,"Have planted seed for 30 years by hand (corn,beans,cucumber,squash,) but when i purchased the Earthway 1001-B i got schooled on how to plant Efficiently, but if the ground isn't free of rock or clods u would be better off planting by hand because this thing just don't roll in bumpy ground. planted 4-150 ft. rolls of corn in less than half the time as usual same with beans learned to tilt the unit toward the holes in the plates so the seed will roll in the plates easier therfore eleminating empty spots in roll. Once u get started their are tricks that u will learn about it as with every other kind of machine. I'm going to try Beets in it this fall that should be Interesting!"
5,Great garden seeder the Earthway 1001-B,The Earthway 1001-B Precision Garden Seeder with 6 seed plates is a real joy to use. Highly recommend it for any gardener.
3,Missing seed plate,Everything arrived on time and in good shape. after I read directions and assembled I found it to be missing the carrot seed plate. Other than that everything was fine.
1,its not worth it,"I thought this would be nice, but I think its was money wasted.Its to hard to push in the ground,if it was sand it might would be easy ,but in dirt it to much work. I would rather plant my hand."
2,disapointed,"I think the product is well over priced for the job it did. It dropped to many seed's. It called for one seed every 7"". this planter dropped 5 to 8 seed's every 7"". It does not cover the seeds as stated. If someone wants one for half price, I have one for sale. Just remember there is nothing precise about this machine. Don't waste your money."
4,Earthway Garden Seeder,"Garden seeder works pretty well. It is easy to change the seed plates and easy to use in the garden. The marker for the next row is very convenient although it misses some spots as the line goes along. The only downfall I have is that the spacing of the holes on the seed plates is too far apart. It leaves about 9 inches between every couple of plants. I had to go back and insert seeds into ""spaces"" after plants began to grow."
3,Pretty good seeder,"Pretty good seeder IF you have very loose, well tilled soil. Not heavy duty and useless in clay soils."
2,Overseed and jams/mashes smaller seeds,"I need to call tech support to see if this is just a bad unit. Assembled quite easily, large seeds seems to work well but the smaller the seed, the more it tends to (profoundly) over seed and then simply mash the seeds and the wheel gets jammed and distorted with the crushed seed debrie. I'll contract customer service and if remedied will raise my rating. So now I have rows that will need a LOT of thinning and a bunch a crushed kale seed..."
5,exceeds expectations,I would highly recommend buying this for large plot planting....it has the side row marker which makes it very nice.
4,A great product to cut the workload down,I bought this product to help me with my plantings of vegetable crops. The product works pretty good. I purchased the optional plates for the other crops. The one problem that I had with this is that the chain that is supposed to cover the seeds does not always work. It has a difficult time moving heavier soils. The resolution was a couple of nuts and bold through the chain to add weight.I would recommend this product if your are planting multiple rows.
3,earthway planter,"the planter works good in soil that is completely level.It is too light to work in dirt that isnt and will run all over the place.so keep that in mind when preparing your bed.If it was built a little heavier pehaps with sheet metal and rubber tires(instead of plastic) it would help with a rougher seed bed (clay based soil).I used it for planting small seeds mustard,lettuce,cabbage,broccoli,turnips.For the money Its ok. Wish they would make a heavier unit for a pull behind model."
5,Easy to use,My husband recently used this seeder planting our garden and it was very easy to use. Last year we borrowed a seeder that works differently from this one. It was used to push the seeds in one at a time. This one was much faster and easier to do. We plan to use this one for years to come.
1,Gardening toy!,"I would not recommend this tool or gadget to anyone. Your soil has to be this finest and even then my plantings were sparse and uneven. I hand planted several rows at the same time and they came up perfect, so I know it was not the seeds. I planted corn and beans and got the same result with both plantings."
1,Junk,It did cut the furrows to desired depth but it was hit and miss sowing beans and small peas. It did not sow the small dill seeds but periodically. I had to go back and sow the misses by hand and then cover the seeds with my rake.
2,Not What I Expected,"I have a fairly big garden, so I decided to make my life a little easier next spring, and thus I bought this seeder. However, so far, it's not what I thought I would be getting as far as a truly precision planter is concerned. The seeds dropped irratically and/or popped out of the bin because the plates would bind up then suddenly spring loose. I used different sized plates trying to find that exact match with the same results. I contacted the factory by email (their response was very quick) and was told to use bee's wax and soap to make it work correctly. For the price of the unit, I expected something with less ""after-market engineering"" required by me to make it funtion as advertised. I refuse to admit defeat, so I'm keeping it and will continue to practice with it until spring. If it or I don't get better, I know where you can get a used one cheap next summer!"
3,speed planting,"This product greatly reduces the time and effort to plant seeds. However, the suggested wheel selections for each seed type isn't correct. For example, I use the wheel for beets to plant beans. I did not use the beet wheel for planting beets as it would deposit way too many seeds (each beet seed is really 4 seeds). The workmanship on the wheels was lacking. There was way too much mold flash so that some slots would not scoop up seeds. The drag chain, that is suppose to close the furrow, is too light and doesn't close it in heavier soils.This product is in need of further engineering.I suggest that, before taking this to the garden, test runs with the desired seed and wheel be done to see how that wheel works with the seed and that the seed spacing is as desired.All in all, this still beats the hoe and rake method of planting"
4,Great product with few glitches.,"I used this seeder last year to plant over an acre of sweet corn and beans. It sure beats bending over for every single row. The only concern that I have with it is that the arm that lines your next row needs to be just a little bit longer. I planted Golden Queen corn which gets fairly tall and wide, and even with the maximum length, they are almost too close together. It is hard to get down the rows without getting hit in the face by every on that plant. This is not a hard fix, though because you don't have to use that piece and can lay off where you want your rows to be with some string or measuring tapes and plant however far apart you want.Overall, a great product for the small gardener and I would recommend it to anybody!"
1,not for me,"i found this unit in my grandfathers garage and decided to give it a shot. after harrowing a field until the soil bed was just right i selected the seed plate to fit my seed and adjusted the depth on the planter to what i wanted. i had to bend over this thing and push with my full body bent on top of it, it did not go easily in my soil type at all. also, even with the properly sized plate it still dropped between 1-9ish seeds in some places and none in others, it is very inconsistant. im sure it would have been much easier in perfect sifted topsoil or somthing but not in the pennsylvania field soil i tried to plant in. im glad i didnt buy this product and would not recommend it to anyone without absolute perfect dirt, who doesnt care about seed spacing."
3,mixed,"I heard grave reviews about this seeder and purchased one, but have to admit it's not as easy as I was led to believe. I wish it would plant just a little bit deeper and do a better job at burying the seeds. Some seeds remained visible and washed away, especially if it rained after planting.I like to take advantage of rain and many times plant on days it's going to rain, or the day before; so having some of my seeds wash away was not what I wanted. I know I can go over it with a rake, which I sometimes do, but I bought this to save time. If I have to go back over the rows I planted, that's not saving my time and defeats the purpose of why I got this in the first place.I don't want to seem like I'm bashing the product because it really is a good product for what it does and is one of the better ones out there. But as a serious farmer, I was disappointed. Yet I would encourage any small garderner to go ahead and buy this."
5,Garden seeder,"Works really well, better than I expected. Planted 1000 corn seeds in about15 minutes, it manages different size seeds without any trouble."
5,Blew APC away...,Not only does Mono slay all other records. These guys blew the Alt. Rock boredom of APC away in Houston. Too bad all the idiot hillbillies had to get scared and throw their bottles at them the whole show.
2,possibly the most Pretentious band in the world.,"If you are familiar with the Buddyhead website, then you know what I'm talking about. These guys sound like a bunch of rich California e-dorks who think they're At the Drive-In. I'd lump them in with the Strokes before I would a good band like ATDI or Radiohead."
5,OPERATION:Typhoon!!!!,"I love this game alot,I had this game since i was about 9 or 10 years old.I'm not sure.The first time I played,i was frustrated.I couldn't beat level 3.So i abandoned it.I think when i was 10 i played it because I had nothing better to do.I then noticed that letting the pteronadon fly to the right gave me enough time to advance to the left.Now, I had come to the rise where rocks were falling.Failing many times i wanted to abandon it again.I noticed that there was a space i can position my self between the rocks.I had a blast going through level 4 and 5,not sure about level 6...because i saw only 5 movies.I was happy I finnally finished the game.Now my game is damaged.I am now 11 and I am buying another copy of the game! OPERATION:Typhoon!!! (jurassic park theme song)"
1,Dino Defender,"This game is horrible, I bought it for my son, he can't play it, I can't play it, his cousins can't play it. All we got was frustration and pretty bad graphics. Avoid this game at all costs,Jurassic park Genesis is a 1000 times better"
1,Broken on second use,"It worked great the first time I used it. The second time, however, I found that it wasn't spraying water/shampoo from the bottom, but the hand held sprayer worked fine.I followed the troubleshooting procedures as outlined in the manual with no success.I called Bissell customer service who had me clean out the little spray heads. That did not work.After a little internet research I discovered that I was not the only person with this problem. It turns out that it may be a broken solenoid valve. A broken solenoid valve after the first use. THE FIRST USE. Sadly, the nearest Bissell approved service center is nearly an hour away. That's almost 4 hours (there and back twice) that I have to take off of work to take this BRAND NEW $[...] hunk of plastic crap to get repaired.It is very likely I will NEVER purchase a Bissell product again."
1,WHAT A MESS,IT ONLY HAS ONE CANISTER FOR DIRTY AND CLEAN WATER. TRYING TO DUMP IT AND NOT GET IT ALL OVER IS A PROJECT. PLUS IF YOU DON;T USE IT FOR A WHILE THE SMELL WILL KILL YOU. YOU HAVE TO LEAVE IT APART AND I USE TO PUT CLOROX IN MINE. NOW I BOUGHT A HOOVER 2 TANK. I LOVE IT EASY CLEAN. ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT HEAT THE WATER.
1,"Two tries, two fails","I bought this machine twice. The first time, after it stopped working after a year of biweekly use, I thought it was a fluke. Bought a second machine, same problem (water won't dispense). Am now looking at a Hoover, instead. Save your money, it's a pricey investment with little return."
5,Irresistible,"I'm never quite sure what to expect from David Baker. His range is so broad (he's created more than 2000 compositions, often with specific musicians in mind) that each one is a surprise. Sometimes he's jazzy, sometimes he's romantic and classical, often a mix, but he's always lyrical, inventive and a treat to listen to.This CD is no exception. My stand-out favorite piece is the title work, ""Heritage: A Tribute to Great Clarinetists."" Many of the clarinet solos are transciptions of improvisations by the likes of Buddy DeFranco, Artie Shaw, and Benny Goodman, rewoven with piano, violin and bass to create a completely new, rich fabric. It's the perfect blend of jazz and classical elements - Baker merged the best of both and the result is deep, vibrant and makes me want to dance gleefully around the room. Everything else on the CD is just icing on the cake."
4,The Thrall and the Dragon's Heart,"This book is very well written and has so much action involved in it. Elizabeth Boyer (the author of the book) explained everything in so much detail, I could picture everything right in my head. The fantasy of unknown people and places, another realm and dark forces. I've never read anything like this before. I give the book two thumbs WAY up. I do admit there are a lot of difficult words, and it can get confusing, but in the end you know exactly what happened and what's going on. Names of characters is the hardest thing to read, but other than that it was rather simple. This book is not a waste of time, money or energy. It keeps you on your toes through out the entire thing. Read it! You'll love it."
4,Intriguing but depressing,"You can clearly see the inspiration for Bladerunner, but the world is a lot sadder and the main character is a lot less likable than in the movie. The androids themselves engender more sympathy, even though they lack the grand reason for being that they had in the movie. They are simply there, and they're not supposed to be. While the movie ended on a note of hope and redemption, the ""hero"" of this book has a lot less satisfying ending, leaving the reader with a dreary image of the future.I like the fleshing out of the bounty hunter profession and backstory, the additional androids, and the complexity of the Rachel character as more than a cross-species love interest. I think they could easily make a movie based on this book that follows it more closely than Bladerunner and still be its own movie and a sci-fi hit."
5,Enjoyable read all round...,"""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" is a brilliant sci-fi adventure through the streets and skies of futuristic society. Set in 2021, this is a story of Richard Deckard; ""Blade Runner"", husband and just another person with the usual social ails.A number of highly advanced androids have made a daring escape ""off-Earth"" and have come back to Earth to try and survive. Deackards job is to hunt these androids, who appear as much like humans as everyone else and neutralise them before they harm anyone.Dicks ability and endless imagination drive you through the book, depicting the state that the world has become (the rare existance of live animals) and the demise of the rogue androids.This was my first exposure to Dicks brilliance and I have since read ""The Man in the High Castle"" and ""Planets of the Alphane Moon"", which have both been excellent. If you enjoyed the movie adaptation, you will be thrilled with this books added detail and depth. Enjoy!"
5,"A great book, but probably mainly for Sci-fi fans.","I gave it a 5, cause its one of the best sci-fi books i've ever read. It's a great book i would reccomend to everyone who likes sci-fi, or want to get into the genre."
2,Not the movie,"I'll admit I got this because I love the movie and I guess I was expecting the book to be better, they are usually are. But they were so substantially different from each other which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I liked the differences, but the novel got a little weird toward the end with some dream like sequences that I didn't understand and I usually don't care for dream scenes. If you are expecting a more in-depth version of the film you get a little of that, but they are so different that you may not like it."
2,Annoying,"I first read DADoES in my late teens and loved it, but now, more than 30 years later, the story feels rushed to me. It is too long to be a short story but not long enough for a novel. I felt no real connection to any of the characters. They were not fleshed out and their world was not convincing.The protagonist, Rick Deckard, seems just as emotionally stunted as the androids he ""retires"" for a living. I kept wondering when the empathy test was last administered to him - and if he would pass it again. Given his lack of emotional response to the discovery of an alternate police station (supposedly ""infested with andys"") and the death of his pet, I seriously doubt it!"
4,Read it.,"The inspiration for Blade Runner. Need I say more? If you love sci-fi, Philip Dick is a must read, and Androids is one of his best.And if you haven't seen Blade Runner, read this then rent that."
4,"great, but not all it's cracked up to be","This book has a huge cult following, as does Blade Runner (which was based on the book, in case for some reason you don't know this). But it didn't quite live up to what I expected it to be. Philip K. Dick is a great writer. And DADES is a great book, but I just didn't think that was all it was said to be. Perhaps his other books are the ones that hit you."
1,An exception to the rule that books are better than movies,"To be fair, I found only a glimmer of similarity between the two pieces. Both pit a number of human-engineered automatons against a single cop, but after that setup the two pieces couldn't be more dissimilar. Dick's work is laborious, boring, the action stagnant with philosophy. There are points when Dick could delve (interestingly) into the hero's psyche and render the author's philosophical and moral arguments more convincingly with action; instead, the writing is too concerned with the sort of adolescent, masturbatory concerns that have tainted science fiction in the past. If you want a brainy, philosophically overwrought read, pick this up. If you want a story that moves -- albeit not without its flaws -- rent the director's cut."
3,"Saw movie first, then read book","Generally, the movie (Bladerunner) is much better. I am surprised that they got that much of a movie out of the book. The book is darker and less exciting. The story is quite different, though, and the book explains some things you see in the movie that go without explanation. Overall, I am glad I read it."
1,Yech!!!,"I absolutely hated this book. It was just a little too weird for my tastes. I'm more of a traditional Heinlein, Asimov, H.G Wells fan and I just didn't get it. I know it is a popular book, I just can't understand why."
3,I have not read this book!,"Even though I have not read this book, I thought the cover looked good. I saw the movie and I liked it. I read all the other reviews for this book. Here is my review of this book that I have not read based on the other reviews I read. PKD wrote this book before the movie and it is very different from the movie. This book has more words than the movie does and unless you are a speed reader you will probably spend more time reading this book than watching the movie. Personally I wish all the other reviewers get eaten by a bear!"
4,a must in a any sci-fi fan's bookshelf,"Philip L. Dick presents a most disturbing vision of the future which may have shocked most readers when it was first published. After the proliferation of dark movie views of the possible future, this may be a candid story to the recent generation. A very consistent one yet sometimes it may not hold you tight enough in thrill(which happens to many writers).Unfortunately I saw the movie ""Blade Runner"" first, which has biased me to thinking of this book as a script, which in fact it is not. I favor a little bit Ridely's Scott interpretation as you may have noticed by not giving it 5 stars. However it is very much worth reading."
3,Spiffy Ingenious Ideas That Need More Development,"This book is very entertaining and fun. The ideas presented are fascinating and intriguing, but--alas--do not get the attention they deserve. If the ideas had been fully fleshed out, I would have given this book 5 stars. But as it stands, it reminds me too much of Lem, who has the same problem: that of inventing brilliant premises and then not carrying them out far enough to give his novels a sense of completion."
5,Great Read!,This was my first Phillip K. Dick book and I really enjoyed it. I couldn't put it down and was disappointed that I got done reading it so quickly.
5,"A good book, especially for it's time","Do androids dream of sleep opens up into a whole new world, one that you would not expect to be written about in the 1960's. P.K. Dick looked ahead, and wrote what he saw.Fans of the movie should be warned, you will see more depth to the characters here, but, not in the same sense that the movie showed you.The movie was ""based"" upon, meaning, in my terms..It was butchered to fit the likes of the director, and writers.If you like a good story, and a fast book, read it, and you will find yourself reading PK Dick a lot more."
4,"If you're a fan of Blade Runner, and never read it ...don't!","I first picked up this book many years ago when reading the blurb that this was the book on which the movie ""Blade Runner"" was based.Now the movie ""Blade Runner"" starred a then relative unknown in Harrison Ford, and was as dark a sci-fi movie as I had ever seen. To me, the pictures, the lighting, the sound and the plot raised questions about what is humanity, and where is the line between humans and inhumans crossed by either side.The movie I rate among the best sci-fi movies of all time.The book on the other hand was a disappointment.In part this may come from my enjoyment of the movie, but I found the book much drier, and lacking in atmosphere.The characters don't seem as clearly defined and the end came across far too loosely.For lovers of the movie, some will enjoy it but others, like myself, will wish they hadn't bothered to read it."
5,Plain and Simple- You must read it,"This book , which inspired Blade Runner and K.W. Jeter'ssequels, which kicked ass also, is one of the best books I have read.It is a must read if you are a science fiction fan"
1,Rent Bladerunner instead!,A perfect Sci-Fi classic! Funny thing is the book was awful! It's the first time I thought the screenplay was better! The movie story and dialog are much better.
1,every one has two,buy this because of the times you''l have experiencing the freedom. Don't misinterpret the sound-sine waves you'll pretend that never occur otherwise. do it for your leaders.
1,"Dump the book, but watch the movie!","This is one of the very rare cases where first there is a book that becomes a movie; and then this movie is so much better than the book. Normaly it's the reverse (however this rule generally does not apply to books written to appear as additional merchandise with the new blockbuster).The movie (that thankfully did stray very far from this book) is ""Blade Runner"" - one of my all-time favorites. Maybe even the best scifi-movie ever. But the book .... . OK, I don't really like Dick. But still, this book is a low even for him. So take my advise: dump it, but get the movie ASAP!"
3,Okay,"Here's the thing: Rick Deckard is an android. Whether Philip K. Dick thinks he is an android is irrelevant. Deckard is an android, and the other androids do not deserve to be ""retired"" just like no human being deserves to be ""retired"". Androids DO dream of electric sheep, and this was an okay book, although I would have liked to learn more about Mercerism, because the conclusion that Deckard comes to is one of the most dissatisfying conclusions to anything I've ever read. They are all androids, with the exception of Iran, Isidore, and a few other minor characters. Deckard is a ruthless android who kills other androids and dreams of owning a live animal. I didn't really like the book, but this stuff is fun to think about. Again, it is irrelevant if Philip K. Dick thinks Deckard is an android, because what one person thinks about another person doesn't change their identity."
2,"Review of ""Do androids Dream of Electric Sheep""","I have to say this book had a some what weak story line. This is a very recycled story line that has been used in so many, longs drug store quality paper backs. This Just happen to be one that had an imaginative setting and decent dialoged between characters. This book is better then most of its class but still, there are betters out there."
1,"Ha, ha, ha.","We are told below that this ""one of the best books ever written by man"", comparable presumably, then, to The Odyssey, The Bible, Canterbury Tales, Hamlet, Don Quixote, Walden, Critique of Pure Reason, The Sun Also Rises, and The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Let's assume, however, out of hand, for the sake of argument, that it really is ""one of the best books ever written by man"": How does it compare to the best books written ever by rooster, drake, or bull (speaking of bull)? What? Was its author awarded the Nobel Prize in Quasi-literate B Science-fiction Pulp? Is this a new category? Let's assume, however, out of hand, for the sake of argument, that it really is worthy of a Nobel Prize in Quasi-literate B Science-fiction Pulp: Wouldn't you still rather read the back of your box of Fruit Loops? (Or, for the that matter, the side panel listing ingredients?) I know I would -- that is, if I actually ate Fruit Loops."
3,no need to set emotions to read this book,"As most people, I read this book after seeing the movie bladerunner. I guess I expected more out of it. It was an emjoyable read but i have to admitt I think Ridley Scoots adaptation was more artististic. For anyone who enjoyed the movie, this is a good book, but for the first time even, i liked the movie more. Do read it if you liked the story line to bladerunner, but be prepared for a difference if it was the wit and language you enjoyed in the movie."
4,Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?,"Philip K. Dick's novel ""Do Androits Dream Of Electric Sheep?"" is about a Californian bounty hunter whose job it is to track down and kill androids, that have escaped from another planet.Philip K. Dick makes in his very thrilling novel a point about the quality of humanity by depicting a society that defines human life by the ability to feel empathy. This definition makes sense within the novel, because the lack of empathy is the only criteria to tell apart human life from artificial life.Rick Deckard, the protagonist of the novel, undergoes a rapid development, that finally changes his view of life. Other important aspects that are mentioned in the novel have similar existential quality, such as the importance of religion or the influence by mass media on our society.If you don't mind a very futuristic and somehow dark setting you will enjoy a compelling story that once you started, can't put down anymore."
3,Perfunctory and Mild,"This novel is a straightforward, easy, albeit slightly dull read, as it lacks much of the zaniness and insanity Philip K Dick's writing is known for. The writing is clunkier than usual and the characters come off as flat. It emphasizes the empathetic differences between organics and synthetics far more than Blade Runner, but the end ideas are the same."
4,Important to Read for Knowledge of American Literary History,"This book was quite entertaining and it helped me to understand what caused the films ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall"" to come about. Because of this historicity*, it is a must-read.Otherwise, I didn't buy the idea that all insect and small-animal life on planet Earth could ever be destroyed by a nuclear war, especially when humans were left alive to walk around in the radioactive dust. I was especially disappointed with the final scene, when the hero comes home and his wife admiringly watches him lay down to sleep without first showering off the caked dust that was all over him.*I started to use the word Historicity after reading the author's other book ""The Man in the High Castle"" which is about San Francisco in a world where the Germans and Japanese won WW2 (Dick has a penchant for San Francisco)."
3,Seen Blade Runner?,"If you have seen Blade Runner don't worry about it spoiling the ending, completely different messages. Everything of Dick's I have read have been wild, inventive, and extremely interesting. I would recomend trying to completely forget Blade Runner (or vice versa) while reading this book, only the names and a few constructions are the same. I actually preferred Blade Runner's main theme, but if you are into sci-fi, you absolutely must read something by Philip K. Dick (Scanner Darkly, Ubik, Three Stigmata of Palmer Elderich, for instance) if you have not already."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I was looking for a ""fun read"" on vacation and, being a fan of Blade Runner, thought I'd pick this up. If you're looking for fidelity to the movie, never mind. On the other hand, this turns out to be much more interesting and cerebral than the movie attempted to be. I'd call it a piece of philosophical sci-fi, posing questions that -- sooner or later -- we'll have to confront."
3,an interesting view of our future,"It's an excellent and weird book of science-fiction, which shows us the strange but imaginable, certainly possible and not to far away tomorrow of our world and us. It's a mixture between a fantasy-world and cruel reality, with psychological and philosofical backrounds and a thoughtful development. What I liked most is how the author analizes religion and the need of humans to believe in something, eventhough it('s or) could be a fake, like Mercerism. I also liked how he ridiculizes ""World War III"" by saying that afterwards no one knew who started or ended it and why they did it, and by letting us know that things, that are trivial and useless to us now, could be very important and even esencial to us in this strange future."
3,Highly overrated,"Very dissimilar from Bladerunner (a nearly empty world, for example, instead of an overcrowded one), and not nearly as deep or meaningful as some claim. There is plenty of better SF out there; read it instead"
2,Thoughts on Do Androids Dream,Do Android Dream of Electric Sheep is one of those few books where the movie adaptation is significantly better than the book.
2,Wheres the action,"This book starts out really good and sets you up for a fast paced adventure about a bounty hunter out to kill androids. But when it comes down the actually hunting its boring. All the action sequences are under a paragraph and in the end you feel cheated. However, if you plan to read a well written and good story this is a good book. But if action is what you desire, go to the next one on your list to read."
3,Ridley Scott ran with this one,"While Phillip K. Dick should be credited for the idea that spawned the powerful and captivating BLADE RUNNER film, that is about all the credit he should be given. The book is initially intriguing, but ultimately fails to ask the important questions the film so perfectly presents. It may have been Dick's idea, but it will always be Ridley Scott's vision"
3,"interesting, a bit boring","First of all I have to say, that I don't exactly know, what to think about this book. On one side I liked it; it was nice to read because the author wrote in an interesting way. There were lots of stories about many characters, which mixed after a while and joined into one big story. I also liked, how P.Dick describes, how humans are discriminating androids, critizising the human race and showing, how different classes treat, (and think about) each other. On the other side I didn't like it; often I was confused, and didn't exactly know about what he was talking. Maybe it just happened to me, due to my lack of English knowledge... What I also didn't like is, that I couldn't identify with any character and that I couldn't get involved with the story.But read it yourself...Matthias Fielsch"
4,I love Dick!!!,"This is the first Philip K. Dick novel that I have ever read, but I'm sure I'll read another shortly. I loved it!"
5,The Pinnacle of Science Fiction,"I bought and read this book expecting your run of the mill sci-fi shoot-em-up. Boy, was I wrong. This is the best of Dick's books and the definition of the genre: science fiction noir. Dick's analysis of the human condition and our downward spiral into desensitization and dehumanization astounded me and urged me to read more. I have read it six times since, and plan to read it yet again."
2,"Makes the movie better, but is not a great book","I don't understand how so many people loved this book. The story is weak. There are some interesting ideas thrown around, but their development is just so-so. What I *did* like about the book, is that the background of the story gives you a lot of insights on the movie, which easily outclasses this book. So, the movie becomes much more enjoyable, but, if not for that, I'd have considered it a waste of time."
3,Not Like the Movie,"This bears only a causal resemblance to Bladerunner. There are androids, hover cars, dilapidated cities, the empathy test, and some action. I found it amusing that even with all the technology, PKD still has the main character using pay phones. The idea that owning a real animal over an electronic one is a key plot mover. I rated it three starts because the tech is outdated."
2,Meh,"Mildly interesting. If you like PDK, of course you'll like it. If you like science fiction, you'll probably like it. If you're looking to enter into either, look to enter elsewhere. This book gets a very slow start."
5,One of the best sci-fi books ever....,Really I don't know what I can add that hasn't already been said about this fantastic book. A must read for even non-sci-fi fans as it could be the book that converts you to the genre!
4,Blade Runner,"Even though the film is a classic, I enjoyed the book just as much. I am a sucker for future dystopias and I got through this in about a day and a half."
4,Interesting diversion,I love Bladerunner and have seen all versions. I was curious to read the book that inspired it. There are very substantial and interesting differences between the book and Bladerunner. I enjoyed both.
5,"The greatest Philip K. Dick, or any other, novel ever.","Oh my Lord, how can a book be this terrific? How? I read this novel with another one awaiting my eyes after it, but I loved it so much that I read it a second time right after finishing it the first time around. The other book could wait! This is DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? and it is pure poetry, pure brilliance. Dick points out our strongest and weakest, and most misunderstood and abused nature. Empathy. Wow."
2,Overrated science fiction?,"I think this book is flawed in its construction. I'll give an example: after the main character discovers a complete android infrastructure, a shadow social world, he does nothing about it. He has killed his target, and the existence of the shadow society no longer interests him. This is absurd, the same as the fact that the androids had engaged humans to kill androids, and these humans had never heard of the real thing. The book presents interesting possible future problems on androids, but I don't like the way they are handled."
3,"An excellent story, a lousy author","While the story is facinating, the author's lack of mastery of the english language can often get in the way of enjoyment. You most likely know they story - Blad Runner was based on this. I don't wish to give too much away but it does try to answer the question of what makes us all human"
2,Strange and Perplexing,I first saw the movie BladeRunner before I read the book. The book to me was hard to understand especialy when Isidore had hallucinations or dreams. The book did not explain who Mercer is or who the killers are. The androids in the book seemed stupid compared to the ones in the movies and made less an effort to survive or fight back. The book was partialy intresting but became boring at the end.
2,Not as powerful as the movie,"Blade Runner is my favorite movie of all time, and picking up this book I expected alot. Dick's writing is completely contrary to Ridley Scott's film, though. Dick's style focuses on queer details about the philosophies of the future (Mercerism, obsession with animals), whereas Scott conveys the more poignant details about the fine line between replicants (andys) and humans. The most crushing difference between the two was the purpose of an android four year life span. In the book, it is simply a question of the cells dying without regenerating. In the movie, it is an engineered tool used to kill the replicant slave just as it gains the emotional capabilities to appreciate life. There are no emotional adaptations in the andys of Dick's book. The androids are so callous and loathsome that the reader doesn't care when Dekkard retires them."
4,Goes deeper than Blade Runner,"Just as in Blade Runner, the movie this book inspired, the line between human and machine becomes increasingly fuzzy for bounty hunter Rick Deckard, who has the job of hunting down and ""retiring"" rogue androids. After a nuclear war all but destroyed life on Earth, the humans who didn't flee to off-planet colonies live in a deteriorating world infused with radioactive dust. It's a hostile but fascinating world with competing religions, dial-up mood machines, 24 hours talk shows and kipple, useless rubbish that increases on its own and will eventually drive out all non-kipple. Empathy, thought to distinguish human from android, is prized and animals are so scarce they've become highly valued possessions. People who can't afford increasingly expensive live animals as pets use mechanical substitutes instead. The book lacks the special effects of the movie, of course, but it goes deeper into the minds of the characters and the questions of existence raised by the plot."
4,Better and worse than the movie,"My 2 cents. It's no surprise that the book is deeper than the movie (Bladerunner) in characters and overall plot. I liked the whole Mercer story. But the movie is more fun in the andy ""killing"" parts. Its a great book and now I want to see the movie again!Blade Runner: The Final Cut"
4,Interesting and thought-provoking,"I liked this book a lot. The ending threw me off a little (the visions of Mercer, Deckard's trip up the hill, etc.). And the final showdown was a little disappointing - the most gripping android chase comes in the middle of the book. But it is very interesting, and leaves you with a lot to think about. ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" has made top ten favorite books list."
3,hard to find,"I already owned one of these, so i ordered it by number. I like the fact that these do not stretch at all is the feature that i desired. The one problem with these is that the portion of the clips that the strap goes through tends to fail. I used tie wire to replace it for a while, but with time it tends to cut through the strap."
4,exceptional,"Bravo to Katherine L. Hester.""Eggs for Young America"" reminds me again why I so enjoy reading quality short fiction. Not only does she nail down thought mentalities from the modern South... she brings the scenes in her stories alive with vivid descriptions of detail. Her characters draw you in, her scenes show you around, and the plots force you to empathize with the main characters. After each story you end up thinking, ""I know someone like that.""Think: a chatty Flannery O'Conner without the gore.I can't wait to read what Katherine Hester writes next."
5,What a collection! What a range!,"Great book. The author's range is phenomenal, with memorable, real characters of different ages and walks of life. Although Hester is a woman, she is very effective at presenting situations from the point of view from both her male and female characters. Her stories made me think and I enjoyed discussing them with my friends. I'm looking forward to Ms. Hester's next book!"
2,ok value,"it's a great quick fix-it item, but one has to be carefull and do not overtightnen the screws. They snap off the threads and then the coupling is unusable. In higher quality couplers all parts are made of metal (brass). Of course, metal is much more durable and reliable."
5,Perfect service,"I got it in time. Packed Nicely and the quality is good. I need it for my presentations as I am in the US and study here at the moment. Funny thing, it cheaper than in my country."
3,Not what you would expect from Leica...,"Working in the photo industry both as a vivid photographer and a salesperson I've use Leica equipment many times. The sturdiness, quality and reliability were always a reason for me to purchase Leica product. Not this time. Slamming you brand name on the average camera to drive the price up is not a right thing to do... It's cheaply made and takes average quality pictures... From the outside it look and feels great but inside you can see right away that Leica engineers were trying to save on finishing costs. Lens is not what you expect and my old Ricoh takes better images... If you are planning to purchase this item do you self a favor and buy their Minilux Zoom model or if price is a factor buy Olympus LTZoom 105. In my opinion Leica just tries to fill the market with their name not with the quality products... It's a nice looking camera not worth your buck."
2,A Leica that's not a Leica,"As someone who's always wanted to own a Leica camera, buying a C1 proved to be a bitter disappointment. That first moment of running the lens in and out and hearing what sounded like gravel in the lens barrel wasn't a good start. I immediately sent the camera back and got another one, same thing. A further disappointment was actually using the camera. With a lens speed about as fast as a glacier,(f10.5 @105mm), using the camera in the middle of the day, albeit overcast, with 100 ISO film trying to take a landscape, the camera was screaming for the flash. I sent the camera back and bought a Canon Z135, great camera, half the price and twice the features, (with a much faster lens). Buy anything, but this over rated ""Leica wanta be"""
4,A must for your collection,"I had not seen any of these episodes in approximately 20 years, so when I purchased them just last week I was excited to relive some of my childhood memories. I wasn't disappointed! I cannot wait until additional volumes are released. The special effects are cheesy when you compare them to todays shows, but that just adds to the show's charm. I just hope that my 19 month old son loves these as much as I did so that I don't look as foolish sitting in front of the tv watching them (""just spending some quality time with my family"")."
4,for the memories,"This show along with H.R. Puf n' Stuf and Sigmund and the Seamonsters and a few other Sid & Marty Krofft shows are standouts in my childhood memory of saturday morning cartoons,along with Schoolhouse Rock, but thats another story.As for the three aforementioned Sid & Marty Krofft shows ,these are great for reliving your childhood once in a while.Unless you have small children stick with these small packages instead of the entire series sets.Believe me you won't watch them enough.As for the reviewer wondering why someone remembered watching land of the lost in the same group as transformers.They weren't remembering the original series.There was a short lived remake of the show about fifteen or so years after this one."
5,best of land of the lost,"this is one of the best on vhs and I should Know I have all on tape, I grew up with these and love dinosaurs and sleestaks, when and if they get all on new vhs format? I will by all new then. untill then this is great show for kids too."
5,"LOTL, a Sid and Marty Krofft Classic","Yeah, I know, this DVD has not arrived in my mailbox yet, but its coming. I ordered the videos(vol 1,2) and gave them to my friend's nephew, and he loved them. Now, I need my DVD. There is something magical about LOTL. I know all the episodes are full of corny lines, campy acting, and really fake looking effects, but we as Krofft fans keep coming back for more. Just as we did when we were kids back in the 70's, I find my self in front of the tv with my sugar coated cereal, watching one of the best Saturday morning shows to have ever graced the tube. I havent even gotten it yet, and im waiting on the next volume. So, take a trip back in time, and get this DVD. You wont regret it...."
2,this is music for kindergarten and nursery,"the book arrived on time; but it was really dirty. It had the remnants and parts of insects between the pages. I cleaned the pages using lysol. some of the pages were missing. It was not worth the 15.00 I paid for it. Its a good thing that I can still use the book. The missing pages didn't contain the content that I needed. this book was really old and obviously stored away in an old box in an attic or basement. Sorry, but this is the truth."
5,Excellent,I can't say enough about the Perry Mason series...black and white film...takes me right back to the day when we got our very first TV set. I know I am showing my age but this series is a must-have for anyone who likes a good mystery and court room drama.
1,$42 for 13 episodes??? Gulp!,"$42 for 13 episodes??? Gulp!Love the series, but what's the deal with the pricing?? I think Paramount is pining for the days when they were getting over $110 for seasons of Star Trek-The Next Generation!"
4,A family favorite during my childhood,"Perry used to come on Saturday nights when I was nine years young. My mother washed and combed out my hair while we watched. My cousins and I always replayed the most dramatic scenes by acting them out. I was such a ham, and the more hysterical characters were my favorites. Almost fifty years later, the show still has mass appeal. A true classic!But why, oh why does it take so long for the next volume to come out - six months (or longer) is too long!!"
5,Perry Mason revisited,"My husband is a BIG fan of Perry Mason. I started collecting the series a year ago and I'm up to Season 5, Vol #2. Can't wait for them to make more after I've purchased Season 6 - 1 & 2. The quality of each of the shows is great. And watching each episode without commercials is fantastic. My hubby treats himself to a lunch time viewing each day. He really enjoys them. In fact I hear the Perry Mason theme starting now...."
4,"Perry Mason Season Five, Vol 1","If you have enjoyed the first 4 seasons, this will be just as enjoyable and just as expected, with many memories coming back. There is no reason to have to explain the enjoyment to any Perry Mason fan who already bought past DVD's. Just enjoy."
5,Hurray! Season Five arrives,"So glad this great series is continuing to be released. The price is 36.99, not 49.00. Perry Mason has been widely reviewed on the sites for its other seasons, so I won't repeat them here. However, if anyone knows how many episodes are on this half season, please let us know. Thanks."
5,Great Series Price in Prospective,"Friends of Perry Mason:As a fan of the Perry Mason tv series I must protest the cost problem. When CBS offered PM on VHS I ordered all they had, 60 tapes with 120 episodes. Each cassette cost $24.95 for 2 episodes. Now you may call me stupid but I have watched those shows more than any other in my collection of tapes. Now we are given an opportunity to purchase the entire series in order of air date and folks think $35 for 13 episopes is out of line? Please, spare me. I can't wait for each half-season to come out. I just wish they would come more quickly. I know I'm in a minority and no, I'm not a rich eccentric (retired high school teacher). I have really enjoyed seeing the episodes that CBS never offered. Take care all and maybe be thankful we have the opportunity to enjoy the shows in near HD quality (1080 upgrade DVD player.Rod"
1,Outragous price,"I think Perry Mason is one of the best TV series to every air in the history of television, I have enjoyed the first four seasons very much However I feel that the 49.99 or lets just say $50.00 per half seaon is completely out of the question. I mean GEEZ a HUNDRED bucks for a season is uncalled for and is pure greed. Why stop at $50.00 lets make it an even $100 per half season, When does it end and how much do they think we are ging to pay.I am probaly the top Perry Mason fan in the country and I will never pay this price...this price tag is criminal."
2,A Disappointed Fan,"I am an avid fan of the Perry Mason series and have been willing and excited to purchase each new season of the show as it has been made available. I was terribly disappointed to notice that season 5, vol. 1 was not the crisp, black and white production I am used to receiving. The video was slightly grainy and the sets appear to be shadowy. The filming techniques appear to have changed as well (shooting from different angles in the courtroom and in Perry's office). I also feel that the plots are becoming too involved. I will continue to watch as I purchased vol. 2, but this may be my last purchase. I am inclined to think that ""modern"" filming techniques may have spoiled the simplicity that I so loved in the older shows. The grainy aspect may merely be a quality issue with this set of CD's.I will hope for the best and forge ahead!"
2,Someone's gotta be kidding about this!,"I saw this episode a couple weeks ago when it was broadcast. It was pretty interesting! With interviews from the musical's director as well as Bono and the Edge, it was a fascinating glimpse into a Broadway production that, I have a sense, has thousands of investors who each own 50% of the show.Good though it was, that doesn't explain the issuing just that segment, on a DVD, at what is currently an eighteen dollar price point. This is foolishness. That's better than a dollar a minute for something you can stream on Hulu for way cheaper. This is quite possibly one of the stupidest, most pointless products I've ever seen available."
4,To Begin Where I Am,"this book had some insightful essays by Milosz, like his poetry, his essays were engaging, interesting, an off-angle point of view"
5,Bovary Madness,"If you have the time, then yes, read these letters from the great French author himself. Can't remember if Vol 1 or 2 speaks most about his writing method and beliefs on writing. You can probably get them elsewhere in a how to book, but you certainly won't seem as literate and as smart at your local koffi shop with them as you will with this book--and you can always put some brandy or cognac in your cup whilst hazily reading these beautiful letters."
4,The Bouchard Legacy,"As the South recovers from the devasting clash of the War Between The States, as the American Indians scatter over the prairie, Luke Bouchard has at last returned to Windhaven Plantation. Joined by his beautiful wife Laurie and their two children. The family discovers the unparalleled joys of domestic bliss. But a dark cloud hovers over Windhaven when a fortune teller predicts danger for someone Luke loves. Fifth book in the Windhaven series."
4,low cost alternative,"I couldn't afford a really nice handball and really didn't need it for my purposes. This one doesn't bounce quite the same way as an inflated one would, and I wonder how it will perform months or years from now. I expect that the foam will get softer over time.Because it's hard to get a handball in the right size without paying for a high quality one, this is a good compromise."
1,Do not buy!,"I thought this product would be decent because of the price but I guess I was a little ignorant for thinking that! The product came delivered with a bent left side frame that attached to the base. In addition, the product came with plastic wheels which do not like to turn on ice and when the wheels do not turn the salt does not spread. Never buy a product like this without making sure that it has rubber wheels, horrible product for the price."
1,Junk - 4 year life max!!!!,"I searched the internet, Sears, Home Depot, Lowe's, you name it, for a spreader to replace my Craftsman broadcast spreader that I had bought in 1975 and was STLL completely functional! I was simply rewarding myself with a new one that I assumed, erroneously, would be an improvement over the old Craftsman. Well, I just got through putting down a 5,000 sq. ft. bag of fertilizer and 40 lb. of lime (half a bag at a time) in the Earthway spreader when the thing tilted to the left. Upon inspection, the left leg, through which the axle runs, had rusted to the point it was broken about 80% in half. It will be at the curb for the scrap metal people to pick up tonight. I used it 4 times per year on a 1/4 acre lot. Don't expect it to last long. I guess I may have prolonged its life by hosing it off after each use, drying it and spraying it with WD-40. I never did all that to the Craftsman...which, of course, they don't make anymore."
1,A pointless product,"The Nelson ""Pound of Rain"" advertises a coverage area of 900 square feet, but even with adjustments in water pressure, we found only 9 square feet of coverage. In order to obtain the 900 square feet advertised, one would have to move the sprinkler 100 times.We found much more success with a competitor's product. Don't waste your hard-earned money."
2,"Believe the reviews - skip this one, get a round one!","I thought I would ignore the feedback I read about this product on the internet and try it for myself. I must say I'm very disappointed. I bought a square pound of rain, and a round pound of rain at the same time. The round one is a joy to use. The square one does not produce an even pattern. I mean it doesn't produce an even square pattern, or any shape. To me there's no point in using a sprinkler if it's not going to cover it's designated area evenly! I'm really considering taking a drill to it this winter to see if drilling the square hole round will make it a usable product. Believe the reviews, buy a round one instead!"
2,Incorrect Italian alphabet,"The ""Italian"" words are not authentic because they don't have the Italian alphabet. The English alphabet is used and the words don't exist or are misspelled in Italian."
4,Shop Tinker,"I am finding the book comprehensive. I understand that a number of models are being presented but I'm finding it difficult to asertain the information on my particular motor when I am constantly being referred to another page and/or to another paragraph. However, when I am able to coordinate those referrals, I am satisfied. It's a little more technical than a tinkerer usually handles..."
2,"too generic, pics misleading","I bought this manual to troubleshoot the power trim system on an Evinrude 50 and perform some general maintenance. I found the pics in many instances misleading (not the same as on my motor or hard to see well enough to identify what was described in the text) and the absence of parts numbers a little disturbing for a book that claimed to be a shop manual. If you are already an outboard mechanic, some of this manual might be useful. But if you are already an outboard mechanic, you should already know this stuff anyway. If you are not, you will frequently find this manual lacking."
4,Pretty good manual.,"This manual is pretty detailed on repairs and maintenance. Wording can be a bit confusing, but you can eventually figure it out with a little reading. Lots of good info in there."
3,more complex than Shu Lin's 1970 book,"I bought this book after reading the first few chapters of Shu Lin's ""An Introduction to Error Correcting Codes"" pub in 1970. Since that was very understandable (but unavailable), I opted for this one. Alas, I got bogged down in the additional math almost immediately. This is a bit heavy duty stuff for learning on your own. Maybe I can find a class some day and get through the wall of fire."
5,Love this album,I had this record and loved it but now I need the CD! Chris Christian at his best! Everyone who loves his music should have this CD!
5,great portable stand,"I needed a stand tall enough for me to use when I play standing up--I'm 5'-10""--and this one works for me. I've heard others say that this model is wobbly and unstable, but mine is very well made and sturdy. When I take it on a gig I make copies of the music that will be played for that engagement and put them in a 3-ring binder, so I don't need to carry a stash of books which could overload the stand. However, it will hold a 1"" ring binder and a 1/4"" spiral binder easily. The extensions slide down inside for packing, so there are only 2 pieces to stow in the case. Couldn't ask for a better travelling stand at any price. I say travelling, but it is my one and only stand."
1,"Hamilton Folding Stand, Chrome Finish, 3 section, 59-inch extension","Hamilton Folding Stand, Chrome Finish, 3 section, 59-inch extensionWe are having the same problem of the top clamp not working. So we can never use the stand in the 59"" extension. I have written to Sharmusic about this. This happened within 60 days of purchasing this product, it seemed to work OK for the 30 days the company allows returns. Very disappointing."
4,Never recieved but refunded OK,Good comunication and no problems other than I needed 2 instead of his 1.
4,Hypnotic single,"I was very pleased to see this track released from Moloko's 'Statues' CD. The two remixes clock in at 7:33 & 7:36 minutes respectively. Statues is probably Moloko's most consistent effort to date. It's a pity they've now disbanded as I would have loved to see where they'd go to after 'Statues.'Anyway, I suppose I should talk about the single...<li>Track 1 : Original version - excellent <li>Track 2 : GusGus remix - killer remix, totally hypnotic and in high rotation in the stereo & the car. Love it!<li> Track 3 : JDS electronic mix - good, seems a little 'thin' after the GusGus remix, but still an enjoyable remix.It would have been great to have included a few extra remixes that are floating out there on vinyl."
5,Teenage Fanclub 'Grand Prix' is poprock at it's finest.,"If you like catchy guitar-driven tunes, actual harmonies (not screetching) and not every song sounds like all the others, Teenage Fanclub is a great band, and 'Grand Prix' is probably their finest CD."
4,Near perfect guitar-pop,"This album is worth buying just for 'Sparky's Dream' alone. It's one of those pop songs that recalls the best of the Beatles and the Beach Boys. The songs on 'Grand Prix' are irresistably catchy, and they get better with each listen. It's a shame this record has not been given it's due recognition."
1,not impressed,"It was reversed bladed, but the blade was flimsy. The sword wasn't folded and the point wasn't facing the correct side, i found a better one at a comic shop"
5,Great for new Austinites,"My son is moving to Austin this summer, and this is a great and fun gift for someone who loves all types of music and will undoubtedly be going to the music festivals out there. The variety on this album is wider than on the others available and all the cuts are good. Quality of sound is excellent for a live performance."
3,Alliens has come back,"i want to know more about this thing, about ufo's and what they have done to our planet"
1,Is This Rock and Roll?,This album is entitled Rockin' Rollin' Robbins but contains only Hawaiian songs. I think it is labled wrong.
5,For Pete's Sake!,"Nothing is perfect, but this album is nothing less than amazing. I'd pay the purchase price just for the all-too-rare opportunity to listen to the Stardusters with June Hutton at the helm--the voice of an era.'Arthur Murray Taught Me Dancing In A Hurry' lays me out. 'When I See An Elephant Fly' cracks me up every time I hear it. 'I Remember You' always brings tears to my eyes. 'A Week-End In Havana' blows me thoroughly away.If I didn't have this album in my collection, an important part of life would be missing."
3,A standard-issue 1940's dance orchestra,"Charlie Spivak is the quintessential dance band sound of the 1940s - commercial, professional, but lacking any identity and style other than good musicianship. There is nothing wrong with the band, it just lacks emotion, and Spivak's strangled muted trumpet style takes you nowhere. Despite this, it was a highly successful second league outfit, and lasted well into the late 40's - which is more than can be said for many top-flight name bands! The sound is rather boxed-in, and a lot of the original dynamics may have been lost, which is a shame. An interesting CD to listen to now and then, but it echoes George T Simon's comment that this was a band that never ""let go"" in its performances. When Spivak plays an open trumpet - like on 'Serenade in Blue' the band sounds so much better."
3,"Funny, but may appear stereotypical to non-latinos","This is the story of a mexican american that can't prove his birth in the US, therefore, is treated like an illegal alien (that would never happen, would it?) Some non-latinos may say that the white people in the movie may be unfairly stereotyped as racist or that the hispanics may be unfairly stereotyped, unless you have a million dollars! But is it stereotying, or is it a reflection of reality? Watch the movie and you decide!There are cameo appearances by Cheech Marin and a small, but important part played by Edward James Olmos. The leading lady is a babe, but I have never seen her in any other movies."
1,Terrible spike base,"The metal base with the hose attachments is very poorly designed and made. As the previous reviewer pointed out, it leaks badly and just pops off. There is no way to fix or tighten this junction and when the plastic wears a bit the hose just falls off and sprinkler is useless.AVOID ANY GILMOUR Sprinklers with this spike base. The sprinkler heads themselves work fairly well."
2,"A bit of a disappointment, given the high price","The sprinkler itself works very well, and feels pretty strong.However, the plastic hose connector is not on par with the rest of the construction, the threads are fragile and the seal not so good, therefore expect some leeks, especially if you plan to connect and disconnect frequently.Furthermore, the connector is of a collar kind, and cannot be replaced, meaning that when this cheap plastic part fails you will have a lot of trouble connecting a hose to the sprinkler."
4,Nice Collectable Knife For A Nice Price,"The KA-BAR Operation Iraqi Freedom, USMC collectable knife is a nice addition to my collection and a great Christmas gift from my son. Having served with the Marines during OIF I and II means this knife has some personal meaning for me. Like all other KA-BAR knives, the build quality and balance are excellent. For a collectable, the quality isn't any better than the standard knife's fine build, and only the gold painted picture on the blade sets it apart. But the price remains very nice and affordable. For OIF vets or others who want an affordable collectable knife, this is a great choice!"
5,Cool addition to MONOPOLY!,"What a great idea, adding a casino to Monopoly games! Finally there's some casino action for this Atlantic-City based board game. Definitely a great addition to Monopoly game collector's list and as a casino game just by itself. Finally a reason to dust off that old Monopoly game and add some real excitement."
1,Think twice about buying any Lacie - They are JUNK.,"Take a look at the reviews for other Lacie external hard drive before buying. They are notorious for poor quality and short lives - not desirable characteristics in a drive. My first firewire Lacie looked good, but was defective straight out of the box. The unit woulld not mount. Lacie ""fixed"" it under warranty, but the ""repaired"" drive worked for only about 2 hours before itself failing.The unit now won't even show/mount as a drive on my Mac so that I can attempt to repair it and it is out of warranty. This unit was powered up no more than 30 times and had fewer than 2 hours in run lifetime.Two units, two failures. That is a 100% failure rate. One immediate. One after two hours of use. Check out the reviews for all the Lacie external hard drives - this is not an uncommon occurrence and many reviewers indicate that Lacie will not repair units out of warranty - Lacie obliges you to buy a new one. I, like many others, will never buy Lacie again."
1,Won't get fooled again!,"I have the 250 GB LaCie firewire drive. It worked on my iBook for a while and then one partition at a time would not mount, and now it sounds like there is gravel inside and will not mount at all. I can't wait to see what the data recovery will cost on this 3 month old hard drive. I hope you have better luck than I did."
2,Sixpenny Girl was just okay,I guess I like Catherine Cookson the best. I think when a book is written it should leave things to the imagination. A bit off color for me and very violent. I would not purchase from this author again.
4,An absolute instant classic,"I was looking for anything good when I ran into this cd. You know how it is, the radio plays whoever pays the most, not who's the best. Never even heard of the band before, but I'm going to find the rest of their cd's now. Great sound. Reminds me a lot of early Joe Jackson and Elvis Costello. Maybe even a little Graham Parker thrown in. Love every song, but the standouts for me are Jumping again, Regional hits and the title track."
5,"Excellent Cranberry Product, No sugar","Taking Cranberry daily was recommended to me by my OBGYN. When I saw how much sugar was to be found in juice, I sought a good substitute and tried this product. Like it a lot."
5,As ordered; as expected! !,I have been purchasing this producut from a large chain drug store and was pleased to find the identical product on Amazon at a substantial savings. The delivery was quick and inexpensive.
5,I am very pleased.........,"I purchased the ""Boston Acoustic Three Piece PC Speaker System,"" for a very low price and I received it today. I order it online two days ago. Fast delivery! The set that I purchased in 1999 from gateway, did not work anymore and Gateway told me that they did not have this set anymore. I was very surprise to see the set at AMAZON.COM. I have told all my friends about this web-site, since I found it by looking for speakers for my computer. The speakers are new and arrived to my home in perfect condition. This is a great speaker set with the best sound. I will purchase from this web-site again.1"
5,One surprise after the next,"This CD is one surprise after the next. It's not for someone who is looking for the usual music found today on the radio.It's for you if you like a less tightly produced, less predictable, more live-sounding, more soul-searching kind of music. Fred's soulful voice soars on the first track, Face of Love, then surprisingly, whines out the next, Have A Drink to All the Clowns, reminiscent of a drunkard teetering at the bar at the end of the night, waxing philosophical,a little cynical and yet comical. He pours out his heart on the next few songs, with poetry for ""everyman"", in Redemption and Shooting Star. Fred's guitar is always surprising, too. He uses music in unexpected ways, to underline and bring to life the spirit behind his lyrics in all the songs, but especially in Shotgun. I really enjoy this CD. I hear something new every time I listen to it, and time and again, I find myself stop what I'm doing to listen."
5,I love this,"This ""game"" is perfect for getting your child used to the multiple choice set of todays tests. It is set up in a way that is not intimidating to the player and is fun as well. This product is teaching my child information that she has not learned yet in class. I love it!"
1,A CONCERNED PARENT,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY NINE YEAR OLD, WHO IS GONG INTO THE FOURTH GRADE. WHILE SETTING UP THE PROGRAM IN OUR COMPUTER, IT FROZE UP. WE COULD NOT GET THE PROGRAM TO WORK. AFTER ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES, I CALLED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WHEN YOU CALL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, YOU GO THROUGH SOME PROMPTS AND THEN YOU'RE TRANSFERED TO THE NEXT AVAILABLE OPERATOR. THE PHONE WILL RING TEN TIMES, THEN YOU'RE PUT ON HOLD FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS BEFORE YOU'RE DISCONNECTED. I THOUGHT MAYBE I HAD A BAD CONNECTION OR SOMETHING, SO I TRIED THREE MORE TIMES - SAME THING HAPPENED EACH TIME! I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY TRANSFERED ME TO THE SAME NUMBER, WHERE IT ALL HAPPENED AGAIN!! I GUESS I'M STUCK BECAUSE ONCE YOU BREAK THE SEAL ON SOFTWARE YOU CAN'T RETURN IT. I FOUND THE EXPERIENCE VERY UPSETTING AND MY LITTLE GIRL IS NOT HAPPY TO HAVE RECEIVED A GIFT THAT DIDN'T WORK!!"
4,"Title should be ""The Compleat Tennessee Lake Angler""","The author covers all the major lakes of Tennessee and highlights the most popular species of each lake. They tell you exactly how to catch these species and do a fine job of it! Many species are not covered and river fishing is not covered, therefore it is not really ""Compleat"" (sic). For a book to cover all of that information it would have to be 2 or 3 times as big. This book does a good job of covering what it does cover (lakes and premier species) and I think I got my money's worth."
3,Not what I expected!,The book was informative to a degree but it was not what I expected. I guess I was looking for more information and techniques.
2,Too Stuffy for me,"By representing great women primarily as examples of moral excellence, this story portraits suppressed the particular nature of specific individuals; they are rather stuffy instead. The author depicted them as idealized and generalized figures of virtue, rather than as real persons with actual complexity. This book was rather stuffy, and did not reach my sensual desire to keep reading. Both characters seem to be frustrated and actually lacked depth or deep feeling most of the time."
2,Cheap knockoff of an American classic.,"I looked at this bag at the store side by side with the original toolbelt they copied it from. Occidental makes a bag that has nicer leather, better stitching, better rivets plus it's made in the USA!"
1,Not made like it used to be,"This was my third and last Gilmour that I will ever buy. The first one was great, lasted about 2 years. Then the 2nd one I bought, started leaking after about 4 months. I bought a third one, thinking that the 2nd one was just a fluke. We only used it three times and then it was leaking and not oscillating. I blamed my husband at first and thought that he had hooked up the broken one instead of the new one. Didn't think it was possible to break after 3 times. Will never buy another Gilmour again."
3,Pretty Good Sprinkler,"I got one good year of use out of this sprinkler. It did do a fine job, watered the lawn very well. But the next season it only lasted a short time until the gear broke and would not rotate. Not sure what caused it. May have been one of those things.I would still recommened the sprinkler if you can grab one on sale."
5,Glad I found it,"One of the author, Baz, gave me a copy of this book when it came out and it went to sleep in my library as I was not in a finance mood. I forgot about it until this week as I was stuck on a problem related to risk-neutral pricing and the Girsanov theorem concerning changes in probability measure. I looked at every passage on the the subject until I hit on it. Then I realized that I should have read it before: it is a condensed, but extremely deep , and complete exposition of the subject of theoretical finance.No financial book has the clarity of this text.Other quant books do not have such notions as ""pricing kernel"" and economic theoretical matters. I would recommend it as a necessary piece of the ""quant"" toolkit. Every quant should have it as a background tool as the usual quant literature is standalone and devoid of these concepts."
1,Disappointed...,I was disappointed with the quality of these balls when I received them. One of the two that I ordered split after only one slight use of it. I would consider something different if I were buying again.
2,ball goes flat constantly,"I got my order on time and it was correct, but the ball won't hold air properly. I think this is due to the way it was packaged and shipped. It arrived deflated and folded up. Once I pumped it up full of air, it still had crease marks from where it was folded during shipping. Within an hour of pumping it full of air, it starts to go flat."
3,Kids were happy,"It took longer than expected to arrive...but it was o.k. I would definately suggest getting this ball with additional ""needles"" for pumping up. If you have the same luck I do. They are ALWAYS breaking!! Good quality, still full of air (dog asn't gotten a hold of this one!)"
2,voit balls,three of the balls are shaped like eggs. I did not want to pay for shipping to send them back but I was dissappointed with the quality. Balls need to be round to roll properly.
2,Good While it Lasted,"The balls arrived quickly and were just as they were described. However, the orange one began losing air within the first week and had to be refilled almost daily. Unfortunately, it was completely dead within three weeks. The kids are playing kickball on our blacktop playground, so we need balls that will last longer."
5,Great for Dodgeball,"I'm a youth pastor and I purchased several of these balls to play dodgeball with our youth. It totally beats paying 10 bucks or more each for the expensive dodgeballs. I've had them for about a year now and they've been used at least a couple times a month since purchased. They hold up well, besides having to pump them up every once in a while. No big deal though. They will hurt if you get hit in the face, especially with how hard some of the young guys throw so we made a rule that you're out if you hit someone in the head/face.They've been great, and I would definitely buy them again.Word of Warning:If you do purchase them, just make sure not to over inflate... even with a cheap pump you can stretch the rubber if you aren't careful. Then you will end up with a bunch of deformed, lop-sided balls. Once they get firm and feel inflated, stop pumping."
5,Why purchase this ball?,"I purchased this ball because it was exactly what my son wanted. It is very hard to find a 10 inch, textured playground ball in the winter in the stores. The fact that you have so many colors to choose from, also helped. He bounces on balls and his red one (from a different vendor) popped. So, when I saw these on Amazon I ordered two. Now, his bouncing has resumed and he is happy as can be, as no other ball would do. Thanks!"
2,Voit Playground bouncy balls,Good for the price but not long lasting.... they pop ang get slashed easily. Would be better for an indoor gym not best for outdoor blacktop or concrete.
5,New talent will surprise everyone....,"What can I say about Nicole Cooley? Nobody nowadays injects character into poems. Nicole presents us with a book that spans the 20th century, with the sort of ease we thought Shakespeare left behind. Histrionic? See what she does with Patty Hearst and call me in the morning... Earns the accolades... This is the best book of poetry to be published in the US in the last two years, and I know it. Nicole Cooley is one of those poets who wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror, and travels somewhere else. Little wonder, that empathy for Alice. I hope for much, much more from her."
3,Wish they worked better,"I bought the binoculars for my wife to use at basketball games. They serve that purpose quite well once you have them focused. Therein lies the problem. The focus knob is so stiff that you can't focus without taking them from your eyes and use two hands, one to hold the binocular and the other to clamp and twist the focus knob.I would purchase an alternate if I were to do it over."
4,Bushnell Trophy 8x27 Compact Binoculars,"These binoculars are an excellent value for the features they have such as the O-ring waterproof seals, nitrogen purged fogproof protection, multicoated lenses, Bak-4 prisms, rubber armoring, etc. The images you see when viewing are crisp, clear and bright. However, they are just a bit too large to be considered compact yet they are not large enough to be full sized. The focusing knob does not rotate as easily as would be expected as it requires a little effort to operate. Being a bit too large and the focusing knob issue are my reasons for not rating this item as 5 stars."
2,"Expensive, not impressive","Fortunately I got hold a copy of this expensive book from my local library before I made a decision to order it. I am very disappointed. I thought all recently published books are in color. This book provides only one black and white picture for each aircraft. The description is not extensive either. You can buy better books for much less money from the bargain book section in your local bookstore. Published in 1999, this book is already outdated."
5,Great Value for Great Shorts,These shorts were just what I have been searching for. They are great to work out in at the gym and for lounging around the house. Since I am petite and older I have had a hard time finding work out shorts I like without spending tons of money. These met my expectations. They are comfortable and the length is perfect.
4,REAL QUALITY,"This is a quality item, with all the features even the pro's can appreciate.This thing even tells you when it's at the ideal working pressure, via a gage on the relief valve.Right out of the box this unit went to work, without as much as a stray dribble.The nozzle is adjustable from stream to spray so, it will reach into the tight spots, no problem.If you ever need parts it comes with an order form and a toll free number.If you take care of this item and follow the maintenence guidelines it will last forever.Check your local garden center and you'll see others with similar features but, this one has them all. I do recommend this tool. It's priced right and has all the bells and whistles too. Now get out there and control those weeds"
4,Good product,"This is one of the most used tools in our lawn care arsenal. It is very easy to use and doesn't get too heavy to carry when full. We use this for spraying weed killer on spots in the yard and for spraying insecticide both in and out of the house. We may not use it everyday, but it is sure handy to have. It certainly helps us out by saving us the cost of hiring an exterminator. Its stream can be adjusted from a spray mist to a solid stream so it can reach behind or under anything an exterminator's spray could get to. This is a really good product."
1,Not very impressed,"sprayer arrived today so I loaded it up with water and pumped it up, worked very nice. When i started to spray the trigger mechanism was leaking all over my hand. I attempted the tricks in the instructions and none helped, this dribbled a constant stream of water over my hand. Not acceptable for spraying poison. I will be sending this one back."
1,Seals leak,After 5 times of use the sprayer will not hold the air when pumped. You can hear it coming out but I can't tell from where.
1,Piece of Cra*,"I wish I could give this sprayer 0 stars!!I received this sprayer with anticipation because of the good reviews - I should have known better; cheap sprayers never work!! I filled it with Round-up and two gallons of water as instructed. Pump-pump-pump-nothing. Again, pump-pump-pump-nothing. I took it apart to make sure it was assembled correctly. Put it back together and pump-pump-pump nothing. Got my husband out to take a try. He took it apart and put it back together and pump-pump-pump-nothing!! This is fresh out of the box new and it doesn't work AT ALL - even a tiny spray!!!! So now, we have to dump the contents (expensive Round-up) and go buy another sprayer. I will never, ever buy this brand again. The brand new one will now have to go into a landfill, unused. What a shame!!!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY and go to a local hardware store to buy a sprayer (not this brand) that is easy to return!!"
2,killing weeds,I have had it for several years and use it several times a year to spray poison on my rock mulch to control weeds and I have never had a problem
2,Not Translucent,As described I thought this item was translucent. But it is not. The items still sit in the boxes they came in as they are to expensive to ship back and restocking fees ect. You cannot see fluid levels in them. As performance goes I have no idea. They look sturdy enough. But not what I was expecting to get. I am dissapointed I spent the money on the two of them since I can't use them for my business which NEEDS to see the levels. Don't buy if you are expecting to see the fluid level.
1,Did not receive first item.,"Orderedthis product but never received it. Contacted UPS on two occasions, then contacted the seller. A replacement item was sent and received. Now receiving emails from amazon stating that the item needs to be returned or I will be charged (a second time). Don't order this product from amazon."
2,"OK, hardly ""premium""","This sprayer is light-duty, so the ""Premium"" and ""Professional"" designations are misleading.When I started using it, it was leaking at the downstream side of the valve, where the wand attaches to the valve body. I was able to stop the leak by removing the little filter adapter that had been inserted between the valve body and the wand. Now there's no filter, but at least I am not getting chemical all over my hand.In short, the sprayer does the job it is supposed to, but I'm not confident it's going to last very long."
1,Gilmour Sprayer poor quality,I filled this sprayer when I bought it. I did not need to fill it again for what I was using it for until 3 months later. The second time I filled it the chamber that pressurizes the air came loose from the handle and it would not pressurize to spray. I just got it out for the new season and attempted to fit the camber back into the grooves in the handle.. and it still will not work or stay connected...I purchased a Roundup sprayer to replace it. I will contact the company since the box says it has a lifetime guarantee and see if they will replace. I would not buy this brand again.
3,"good, not perfect","Nice sturdy product. Find it a bit dificult to mix properly without being able to see liquid level through container. I now understand why so many have a clear plastic or at least a clear window to help with measuring. I guess one of my products I use (a powder mix) got too thick for the unit, so I had to clean it out, a full dis-assembly was tough and involved a bit of cutting and fugazi re assembly!!lol. I guess for $33 I expected a little bit more, live and learn. Not totally disappointed, not totally not either."
4,Nice Tank Sprayer,This sprayer is made of very solid material. I'm using it to spray insecticide and it works fine! Highly recommend this product.
4,Micra is excellent! But go for the silver...,"This review is not about the functionality and practicality of the Micra: that speaks for itself. Just a quick caveat emptor: Buy the silver one! I received a blue Micra as a birthday gift, and within one week, 20% of the blue finish had worn off. Of course, I carry it on my key ring and there's a lot of abrasion there, but Leatherman should think of such a thing. I don't mind the look of my worn and weary! Micra, it was the flakes of blue paint that annoyed me most.BUY a Micra, only make sure it's Silver!"
3,Buy the silver Leatherman Micra...,"I own the blue Micra tool and the paint all chipped off after a week of owning it.... that's probably why the paint isn't covered in the warranty. Otherwise, it's a great tool."
5,"A Must for Every Dad- and Mom, too!","My kids got me one of these for Christmas last year. I love it! It really comes in handy for so many things and although it is a little weighty on my key ring, it is well worth it for the convenience. I don't think I could do without it now!"
5,Great gift!,I gave one of these to all of my groomsmen- they liked them much better than a money-clip or beer stein. Got one for myself as well- Durable!
4,Leatherman quality in a tiny package,"Wow, this micra tool was smaller than I expected! But the quality is very nice, this will do a much better job than my old Swiss Army mini knife, the scissors in particular. This is a perfect size for tucking into a purse."
4,can't go anywhere without it,"I used to have a little swiss army knife...but the leatherman blows it away. Compact with more functionality. Use the little screwdriver to tighten glasses, scissors, and bottle opener often."
4,Don't Bother getting one with a color,"I bought a red micra about two weeks ago and have on my key chain. What I thought was going to be some sort of anodized color finish and permanent is now chipping away. Don't bother spending the extra 2 dollars. Other than this minor detail, it's a great product."
3,"Nice tool, but has not held up well","I've had a Micra for about a year and a half and have found it very handy. It has all of the tools you need, but I've had to re-assemble it a few times because the screws that hold it together keep loosening and falling out."
4,Love the tool. Love the size.,"I got this 3 weeks ago and love it. I did not want something more to carry around (cellphone, palmpilot, keys, wallet, ...) so I wanted a small yet competent tool. This is great for those urban needs.Thinking about it again, I might have gotten the cheaper black one instead!"
3,A Happy Little Movie,"I am a Bette Davis fan. Having never seen this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. It was a cute movie with Bette Davis, as always, giving her best. As Apple Annie, she is a classic. Later, as she portrays a society lady, you want to cheer for her. It's a comedy at times with all her old pals trying to help out to fool her daughter's rich father. It's a feel good movie. You just know everything will turn out right at the end and it does."
4,Christmas charmer,This story about a community of folks coming together to help one of their own is a real charmer.
1,terrible !!!!!!,"I was unable to view this DVD. When I contacted Amazon I did not have any reimbursement. Therefore as of now, this DVD is collecting dust on my shelf. Very disappointed."
1,Movie would not play,Do not buy this movie! Gave it to a friend for Christmas. It will not play on DVD players! Make sure you read the small print. So disappointed.
1,Defective Disc received from Movie Mars,"We were sorely disappointed that the family not able to watch this classic movie during the holiday period.Unfortunately the ""Pocketful of Miracles"" DVD received from Movie Mars was defective and was not recognized by either of the two disc players we use to watch all of our movies. Of the many orders placed with Amazon and often fulfilled by Movie Mars this is the first time we have had a disappointment. Hopefully this issue will be resolved by one of the two companies within the near future, as I would like to continue as a valued customer."
1,Pocketful of Miracles,"When I ordered this movie, I was unaware that it is for viewers in the UK. I had to pay a lot for shipping so now I am stuck with a movie that I cannot return because it is not cost effective to do so. I am very unhappy about this purchase."
1,Pocketful of Miracles,Just viewed tape and I am very upset with its remastering or copying.Tape is choppy and shuts out most of the music in the movie .I also made the mistake of buying it in wide-screen. This is one of my favorite movies and I will now have to reorder it and count my losses with the price of the tape I have.
1,Pocketful Of Stupidity,"I tried to be open about this movie and like it - I really did.Huge Bette Davis fan, but even she can't save this attempt athumor and pulling of heartstrings. Horrible. All the other actorsare even more forgettable and boring. UUGHH."
2,Disappointment,"I found this film to be forced. Everyone was trying to be funny rather than playing it in a serious mode and allowing the plot to supply the humor. I'm a big Glenn Ford fan but never found him to be accomplished in comedies. He's miscast as Dave the Dude, a part better suited to someone like Dean Martin. Peter Falk is excellent as is Bette Davis as Apple Annie, but the film falls flat. I never really liked the 1933 version ""Lady For a Day"" any better."
1,Extremely boring,"Sure this book is well written and educational, but talk about BORING and UNINTERESTING. Please dont waste your time. If you want to read about censorship in a creative, fun way, read Farenheight 451, or for something more similar to The Day They Came To Arrest The Book, read Nothing But The Truth. I am an avid reader and I read ALL the time. I know a good book when I see one, but this is definitely one you could do without"
5,Best Hose Ever,"Just a quick review: We bought a couple of these hoses in 1999 and they have been in use and kept outside in the Southern California sun continuously for 9 years. The hoses are in perfect condition! Based on how long they last, they are also the cheapest hoses ever. We had to replace one because a construction crew drove over it repeatedly with a bulldozer, but that's hardly normal use. The Flexogen hoses are also much lighter than most high quality hoses. Highly recommended."
5,"Great product, very well made","I would recommend this product to anyone with the need of 3/4 inch hose. It offers full flow, very strong without kinking. I think it's the best hose sold in USA. Thanks Amazon for offering this quality product."
5,Excellent Buy,"This garden hose does what others claim but don't do: it does not kink. It may not be the lowest in cost, but it appears to be the best value for your money. Well constructed at the two ends, too! I am happy with it."
4,"Good hose, just hard as a rock to coil unless it is over 70 degrees","Great hose, just not so flexible in the cold. It memorizes its shape in the cold months, so uncoiling it is kinda awkward, but no problem in the summer."
2,Nothing what I expected,"I expected this to flow much more water as it is larger. Not so. I also did not expect it to kink as much. Gads, it kinks like crazy. I cannot recommend this hose. Being larger in diameter I did think I would be more difficult wind up but it is. Can't tell ya how disappointed I am in this hose. I cannot recommend it . I would recommend a smaller diameter hose and get a stronger flow and more powerfull flow ... which makes sense, smaller opening makes a stronger flow. This darn thing kinks like crazy, much, much more than my 75 foot hose. Don't waste your money."
5,love it,Will use this hose until it no longer works. Love it... And it is USA made. That is a plus in itself.
4,"Gilmore 10 Hose 3/4"" x 50'",Would order again. Second one I've had. This one is for my back yard. I will order another one later this summer.
4,GREAT HOSE BUT ITS A JOB PULLING IT AROUND,This is a great water hose. no kinks which is what i was looking for. Be aware that its a big hose as in big around and it takes a lot of effort to pull it around when watering flowers or using with pressure washer. it will wear you out!!!!! KEEP THAT IN MIND BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS HOSE FOR YOUR WIFE or an old man like me! still a great hose and if it were not so hard to drag around i would give it 5 stars.
5,Good Hose,I just received this hose. I've only used it a few times over the past few days but so far I am very impressed. It really feels substantial and I like the large diameter. The real test will be whether it becomes prone to kinks over time. I have my fingers crossed.
2,Nice hose but....,"I bought this to use on our hobby farm for watering livestock. The hose itself is robust and relatively kink free - in fact all I would expect. However we are returning it because of a worsening and persistent leak at the rotating connection between the female end on the faucet end of the hose and the hose itself. It started the first time we used the hose with just a few drops of leakage but now half fills a 5 gallon pail every day while we fill stock tanks. I am disappointed because I thought I was finally going to find a reliable 3/4 inch hose and while I think I am just unfortunate to have got one with a faulty fitting, I am going to try a different hose next time."
1,Poorly Manufactured,"When I received the hose, I made sure to unroll it completely. The first time the water was turned on, the hose had a pin hole in it. Now I have to go through the process of rolling it back up to return it. Not worth the effort. Thankfully amazon.com has a good return policy."
3,Wonderful Hose,I had this hose now for two weeks and cant believe how great it is. You wont be dissapointed in buying one of these fantastic hoses.
4,Last hose you'll ever buy.,This hose is very good although because of its larger diameter it kinks a little easier. If the hose ever fails they replace it for free. Really nice quality and great guarantee.
1,Junk,"I am the owner of a pressure washing company so I am very familiar with hoses. I was seeking a hose for my home that was lighter than professional grade supply hoses as well as being more economical since it would not see heavy use.My concerns with the hose:• It leaks at the coupling. After applying plumbers tape to the faucet and replacing the O-ring gasket with a better one, I was able to stop 90% of the leaking. There is still a slow drip, even after that effort and added expense.• The hose kinks. Not just in overly-stressed angles but constantly. This is what killed the hose for me. I've used the lowest grade box store hose that didn't kink this much. Its a never ending battle of stopping to walk back and un-kink it.There was no way I was going to pack it up for shipping back. I put it at the back of the house where there is a flower bed 8' from the faucet and bought a real hose (GoodYear pro-grade red) for the side. Waste of money."
1,Do not waste your money,Do not waste your money on this expensive hose. It kinked after 4 months and actually ripped after 14 months. It is three times as much as a standard hose and is a big rip off.
3,Stiff and stuck in its ways,"While the price was good, this hose seems to have a mind of its own. It's very hard to get it to coil up on the hose rack - it keeps developing weird bends. The end of it was so crimped when it arrived that it's very hard to get it to stand out straight. It keeps wanting to point to the ground no matter what I do. Hopefully, it will soften over time. The choices for 3/4"" hoses is very limited, so for the price, it's as good as any of them seem to get."
5,Great Hose - Great Value!,"This is one heavy duty, simply great hose. It does deliver significantly more water volume than the typical 5/8 inch hose, but it is significantly heavier!It coils easily and so far, does not kink.If you want the best, this is it!"
1,Flowguard Plus collar NOT INCLUDED,"This review is for the Gilmour 10-34100 Flexogen - 3/4"" x 100' hose. If it is critical or important to maintain water flow, then pass on this hose. The Flow Guard Plus collar is NOT part of this hose. Amazon's web page incorrectly pictures and describes the product as having the kink resistant collar. I need to supply water to a 4 gpm pressure washer. Uninterrupted water flow is critical for this application. Therefore, I am returning the hose. Also, be advised the Amazon tools-tech-support department assured me this hose has the collar. They were wrong."
5,Quality hose for a good price.,This 3/4 inch hose is a quality product and the free shipping fromAmazon made it an economical purchase compared to other retailers.I'll probably buy more of these hoses in 3/4 inch size soon.
1,Rip-off,These hoses suck! Bought two. Used one twice and had to trash it. Pressure decreased greatly and has multiple bulges. Second one did the same the first time we used it!
1,A disappointment,"This ""book"" is really more of a pamphlet, cheaply printed and stapled together. I found the writing dull, which the author compensates for with an overly liberal use of exclamation points(!!) The illustrations are crude and childish. Historical information is accurate but sometimes hardly enlightening: ""The romantic movement involved all of us: artists, authors, musicians. We added a welcome emotional element to the arts. In piano music, this change was made possible partly by new designs in pianos. These new pianos were exciting!"" or ""It was then that I got better aquainted with George Sand. The rest is history."" While the concept for this book is good, the execution is disappointing."
1,"Why, oh WHY do authors put ongoing series in ANTHOLOGIES?","I have been reading Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series, and enjoying it. But now I see that one book in this series is in an anthology - an anthology I have no interest in purchasing, since I don't especially like the work of the other authors included. In addition, anthology stories tend to be too short and unsatisfying.Write a one-off story for an anthology, by all means, Ms Kenyon. But WHY put part of an ongoing series in one? It only irritates loyal readers, who feel ripped off at having to pay full novel price for an unsatisfying novella. They will either pay it and feel dissatisfied, or not pay and feel unhappy about having missed out on part of a series due to what seems like the author's lack of forethought.-wmr-uk"
2,"Good, bad and ugly","This anthology was a huge disappointment to me, and I was shocked at the lack of quality in the last two stories. Sorry, but this book just isn't worth the cover price.The Sherrilyn Kenyon story was oversimplified and lame, but I'd say it was decent considering the length restriction. It seemed really short. The Amanda Ashley story was enjoyable, but if I had one complaint it was that there was sexual tension between the two main characters that Ashley did nothing with.Red Moon Rising was a good story with plenty of action and I'll definitely look up more of Lori Handeland's work. As for Make It Last Forver... This story was absolutely awful. It rambled on, had no point, had thoroughly dislikeable, unattractive characters and there was no payoff at the end. From this one example, I'd say that LA Banks is a poor writer in this genre."
2,BORING (with one exception)...,"Simply put, the stories in this anthology were amusing if a little staid, not living up to the zing or power of some of the more hip collections (How to be a Wicked Woman, etc.)The one exception to this rule was the story by L.A. Banks. That one was awful. Absolutely awful. Too much description, not enough conversation, a hero who's saving the world by playing his guitar (huh?) and an ending that was not only dissapointing, but down right absurd. I will certainly not be searching out any other stories by this author, and will avoid any anthologies she's included in."
5,Awesome anthology!,"A must read if you love any of these authors: Sherrilyn Kenyon, Amanda Ashley, L.A. Banks or Lori Handeland! I really enjoyed all of these stories and have added this book to my collection."
3,Half and Half,This book is a must have if you are a collector of the Dark Hunter books. Another great Were-Hunter short story by Sherrilyn Kenyon that would have been awesome as a whole book. The Amanda Ashley story was equally enjoyable. I didn't enjoy the last two stories as much.
1,Cheesy Supernatural Romances,"If you enjoy reading cheesy romance novels with lots of steamy sex, this is the book for you. However, if you enjoy reading good quality horror novels (e.g., Anne Rice), then absolutely do not buy this book. The stories in this book are not long enough to fully develop the characters, and the supernatural plotlines are not even remotely interesting."
2,Ho Humm,"I bought this book for Sherilyn Kenyon's story. It was fun but sadly felt a little too quick and a little bit lacking in depth even for a short story. I felt like I could have picked this book up in the bookstore, finished her story in 20 minutes and put the book back,Amanda Ashley' story was so blah and unreadable. I trudged through it. The ended made little sense and I was left thinking Huh?The L. A. Banks story I gave up trying to read. Perhaps it is me but for some reason I just cannot get into books that start off in 1979.Lori Handeland's story I found a little better. Sort of interesting and I was able to read through it without looking at my watch.Overall I felt like it was not worth the price of the book."
3,The only one saving this is Dante,"This book earned three stars from me only, and exlusively because of Dante Pontis, the hero of Sherrilyn Kenyon's ""Winter Born"". What can I do, I'm a sucker for Hunters - Were, Dream, and specially Dark ones.The L.A. Banks' story just made me skip pages, but the other two were passable.Nothing to miss, there."
2,2/4 stories ...,"Kenyon's stories as usual continues to provide entertainment and very addictive vampire plots that leaves you wanting more and more. I just hope she doesn't get a writer block like feehan's Dark Destiny and Hamilton very disappointing ""Incubus Dreams"".Favourite part of the book is SIMI's shopping spree. Ahhh if I had endless line of credit card with no worry about the payment I be in heaven.HOWEVER... and I mean HOWEVER, the rest of the collection of short stories is........ dull. Ashley's stories was suprisely not here best or even average usual stories. The other two authors left me falling asleep. I started skipping pages which equates ""BLEH"".Since I'm an avid reader of Kenyon, I'll be keeping it for the sake of ONE short story to be added to my collection of vamp bks. OR I would have returned the book."
2,Hmmm also...,"I have to agree with the review written by Emily Walsh: the best one was Sherrilyn Kenyons story, then Lori Handeland. Amanda Ashley's story was blah und L.A. Banks story kinda strange....I did not get it. I guess you have to know the characters L.A. Banks writes about, otherwise you just end up confused (Guardians and Seers, anyone?). You know, like me....anyhow, looking forward to Sherri Kenyons full story."
3,Liked 3 out of 4,"Enjoyed Kenyon's Winter Born / Amanda Ashley's Born Of The Night / and Lori Handeland's Red Moon Rising. I have read Ashley and Handeland before but not Kenyon and Banks. Have to say the Kenyon story made me want to search out her Hunter's series but I don't think I'll EVER buy a L. A. Banks book again. Her ""hero"" and ""heroine"" weren't unlikable but the story was so disjointed it was hard to follow. Then, when the relationship between the two became love not just lust, they had the rug jerked out from under them. I might be in the minority here but I like my ""romances"" to have HEA's. I hardly think being together once a year for 23 out of 24 years is feasable. Sounds like more pain than pleasure. I bought my copy at a used book store so was pleased with the book for the money."
3,good short storys,"these short storys were good, and short. I like Sherrily Kenyon is the reason I bought this, amanda ashley story was good, but I do not see me buying her books right now, same o same o"
2,Not up to par,"I've recently become a big fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon. Her writing is spectacular and her character's are vivid and interesting. I purchased this book in the hopes that not only would I get a good story from Ms. Kenyon, but also read other authors of the same genre who I might find interesting. I must say that I was disappointed by these stories. While Ms. Kenyon's full length books tend to enthrall the reader (except for most dream hunter ones, but that's for another time) I found her story and the others in this compilation lacking something. Perhaps the genre does not lend itself to the short story as well as the full length novel and those who haven't read the full length novels might like it. I personally found them lacking."
3,"Decent as dodgeball ""stingers""","Overall they're pretty good as ""stingers"" in NDL dodgeball. However, they're really easy to pump up too much and they get a weird deformity when you do that. They get an egg-like shape."
3,"This is a 6"" ball not a 10"" ball","I looked hard in the description to find the size of the ball. The only clue was the picture. I received the ball, and it is 6"". The ball has 6"" written on it, the picture has a 10. I looked at the description in the past orders, and it now says 6"". The ball is too small for the purpose I had in mind, for my class on the playground."
2,Barley bounces,"This ball seems to be very durable, but has very little bounce to it. I bought it for my 2 year old to kick around. Its too big for him right now, but that is compounded by the fact that the ball just doesnt have much spring or bounce. It may be good for a dodgeball kind of game, but no so much for kicking around."
4,What it needs,"What it needs is a solid lid, so you can take off the sprayer part and screw the lid on and not spill the unsprayed chemicals. If you leave it on, with the hose attached, and you put it down, it will tip over and leak on the ground through the top. Works well, otherwise."
3,Its an alright game.,"I used to play the first Seaworld tycoon and it was okay. Then they released Seaworld Tycoon 2, which really doesn't add anything new its just 3D now. Both are okay, I personally don't play them anymore."
3,Not what I ordered,"When I ordered this item, I did not recieve the edition that matched the image on the screen/book I had requested. I had wanted the edition with the blue and black cover like the one in the image but instead recieved a different one."
3,The Hotel Parking Attendant Comedy We All Waited For,"This hooter is noteworthy only for its look at the early Melody Griffith, who was quite young and different when this attempt at a comedy was released in 1980. And Frank Gorshin -- as usual -- gave his role a lot more than it gave to him."
3,Flawed - correction,"In my review/comments, I incorrectly stated that ""Grady often quotes from the Kroegers' book (I SUFFER NOT A WOMAN: RETHINKING 1 TIMOTHY 2:11-15 IN LIGHT OF ANCIENT EVIDENCE) and Rebecca Groothuis's book (GOOD NEWS FOR WOMAN: A BIBLICAL PICTURE OF GENDER EQUALITY)."" He in fact does NOT quote from or reference this book of Groothuis's, but he does refer to another book she wrote, as well as other books with similar views."
5,Recommended,Durable with thick padding. This is a excellent product for volleyball. I've had several pair of these over the years.
2,Super disappointed at the ink flow on the medium nib....,"If you ordered the medium nib - and you don't want globs of ink - get the fine nib. The medium literally bleeds ink on paper and looks absolutely terrible. I couldn't be more disappointed with this product considering the overall great reviews that I have read. Other than the terrible look on the paper, the pen feels decently made, hence the 2 stars. If I had to do it over again, I'd simply pay more and get a decent pen. This was a total waste of money."
3,feels unbalanced,"I like it in general, and have several ball points that are exemplary. Unfortunately, this fountain pen does not live up to the same standard. Lightweight, it feels unbalanced in the hand. Overall it feels a bit cheap. Nib is ok for writing, but it leaks, and not just a little. I've owned other fountain pens, so I'm familiar with their special needs for care and feeding."
5,"Amazing pen, doesn't leak on your pants!","After my Lamy Safari destroyed a nice pair of slacks (I love the pen, but the cap comes loose far too easily), I searched high and low for a decent pen that wouldn't leak and I finally found this one. I LOVE IT. Only all caps can express the feelings I have for it. It writes beautifully, it has a great heft and feel, and it works with every ink I've tried it with, even ones with iron gall in them. Built like a tank too. This pen is ten kinds of awesome."
5,Smooth,"Never leaks, retractable nib works brilliantly, comfortable to hold and writes really smoothly on lots of paper types. Best fountain pen I've ever owned."
5,great combo,"got this pen and took it apart. the nib looked to small but put it all together and filled the pen. Have used it constantly and really enjoy this writing instrument. I prefer fountain pen for my work but often make note on the go which makes it difficult to use both hands to remove cap. With this pen I have all the benefits of a fountain pen with the ease of a click pen. I give it high marks once you get used to having the pocket holder on the ""wrong"" end."
3,Like it but....,"Exactly what I was looking for but it's a bit uncomfortable to write with given the clip. Also, the ink is a bit messy within pen, but it has not leaked in my pocket. Other than that-I really like it, very cool, especially since you are usually the only one in the room with a retractable fountain pen. I recommend for taking short note and signatures, not for writing longer letters, etc."
5,"Beautiful, Functional and Fun!","I've been using these Namiki vanishing point fountain pens for years. They're incredibly reliable, don't leak, and there's just nothing else like them on the market. The one thing I'd say is that the nib is inherently fine. If you're waver between a fine and medium, go with medium on this pen. The other warning is that you cannot use standard euro cartridges with this pen -- you HAVE to use Pilot's cartridges because of the way they attach. If you're one of those who loves funky and fun ink colors, you'll need to use bottled ink rather than cartridges."
3,"Convenient fountain pen, but not good for lefthanders","This pen's really nice for anyone who loves writing with a fountain and who does a lot of writing. The vanishing point lets you easily retract the nib (unlike other pens that you have to cap/uncap as you write or take notes. The pen doesn't work very well for anyone who's lefthanded--while it lays a lovely line if you ""pull"" the nib across the page, it lays a ragged line when you're ""pushing,"" and the positioning of the clip restricts the ways in which most of us who are lefthanded will reposition our grip to compensate."
5,Best Fountain Pen EVER,"Especially great for people who write, do something else, write, do something else, etc. WIth a traditional fountain pen there's that cap thing that makes it inconvenient to use intermittently. The Vanishing point is a one-handed take it out. click it like a ball point and write, click again and back in your pocket. I agree with the comments about medium vs fine. For general writing go with medium, for fine doodles, sketching, etc go fine."
3,Not Impressed,"I have enjoyed more commercialized dvds on Sedona. Felt this was not professional. Had to turn the volume up straightaway, I could not understand the narration. At times people were talking all at once? Not worth the price. Save your money and find something else on Sedona. Karma Trekker for instance?"
1,Never got my book :-(,"I never received this item...thought it got lost in the Christmas shuffle, however, I don't believe it's coming! I am very disappointed! This could very possibly be an error within the mail service used...I'm just reporting the facts here...Thanks,Kathy S Fortenberry"
3,Eddie Fisher and Al Jolson,"I watched Eddie Fisher when I was a kid, when he was doing the coke show. I don't know what happened. I guess my taste have changed as I've gotten older. I was a little disappointed. His voice wasn't as I remembered it. Al Jolson he ain't. But I continue to listen to the cd. Some songs bring back memories."
1,Excellent while it works well,"Attracted to its nice design and the Gilmour name, plus the ""lifetime leakproof seal"", I purchased this hose nozzle. I had tried different brands and models before and all of them became useless after a few months, due to leaks and/or a failing trigger spring. The Gilmour worked like a charm for a year and then, like the others and for the same problems, became useless. Hoping I had purchased a defective unit - and still believing in the reliability of the ""lifetime leakproof seal"" - I got two more. All of them had the same ill fate after about a year. Very deceptive!"
1,bad i am so unhappy,"my nozzle is LEAKING. I am so sick of buying things that dont work. mine is less than 3 months old, and now all settings leak... i greased the o ring and still leaks....what a piece of crap. I have millions of dollars but cant get a good nozzle. does anyone make them?"
1,Leaky,"I bought two of these; eventually they leaked and I returned them for replacements under the lifetime warranty. Within a few weeks, the replacements leaked. I returned them and got new ones. I have used one now for about three weeks, and it has started leaking. I have to turn the water off at the source, and turn it on whenever I want to water the lawn. I am just wasting my time and postage money."
1,duped be description--NOT MADE IN USA,"I purchased this item online with the belief that the description, including the words ""Made in USA"" were to be true. It is not. It is made in a country that currently trades with the U.S. and does not mind that high lead content and poor quality are a hallmark of their exports(never mind their workplace or human rights records!!!)I would send it back, but that would only throw good money after bad. Buyer beware, all descriptions are not the same and are not necessarily accurate...verify by phone first before you buy."
1,More crap made in China,"Is anyone surprised anymore when their product completely fails? You have to ask yourself...when companies are not willing to pay people over 50 cents to $2 an hour to manufacture their products, don't you think they are building them with the cheapest materials.This particular pos worked about 8 times."
2,Junk,"I bought the metal version over the much cheaper plastic version because I thought it would hold up better. I dropped it within the first week of owning it and a piece inside broke and it now leaks as much water out of the head as is sprays. Today I bought the same unit, but this time with a plastic shell! I like the nozzle, and hopefully the lighter weight will keep that piece from breaking if it hits the ground."
4,Amazing!,"As an ex-anorexic I founf this book to be very real. The best thing about it is that it tell sthe story of the anorexic from her family's point of view versus her own. Making all the ""bad"" aspects seem horrible versus glorified. It made me realize how my choices effected those I love! I cried, I laughed, and I read it again and again. I highly recomend this to any recovering anorexic and all of their family members. It illustrates a higher understanding!"
2,Not what I had expected,"This book is a good peice of young-adult fiction, but it is not a book that really probes the nature of an eating disorder. The book is a portrait of a 16 year old girl who lives a typical 16 year old life. Her older sister develops anorexia when she leaves for her first semester of college, but the eating disorder senario is more of a subplot to the boyfriend/ best friend sagas that consume most 16 year old girls. In fact, the eating disordered sister is away at college when the book begins and is hospitalized in the middle of the story, so she is absent throughout most of the novel. The book concludes with the trivial boyfriend/ best friend crisis resolved, but there is no epilogue to let the reader know the fate of the eating disordered sister. Do not read this book with the intention of gleaning information on the causes and effects of anorexia; I do not recommend this book to anyone over the age of 14."
3,"Decent, but stereotypical","Too simplistic in that it continues to paint all women with EDs as from well-to-do, affluent families who are simply concerned with weight. EDs are not only about weight and anybody can get one, regardless of social status. Still, may be a lesson to those who think having an eating disorder is cool ""Because you stay thin that way."""
2,"Poor, Poor Representation of Anorexia","I was shocked to read this book and how it played up all the problems that further an anorexics pain(the out of touch, selfish, suffering family). This book is about everything but the one individual that is disappearing and screaming for life and attention. I am sad to see the whole book focus on the younger sister and her relatively healthy existence. I would never recommend this to someone with an eating disorder, simply that it will make them feel less than I already know that they feel. Second, I wouldnt recommend this to any individual that is living with an anorexic because it brings the attention back the people that are ignoring the disease versus the person hurting. This book is selfish to the disease and the pain it ravages on its individuals. Anorexics are not crazy or mad, but rather intelligent, extremely complex, and high achievers in all aspects of life."
2,Real?,"As I was reading this book, I picked up on a lot of certain behaviors that I thought were unrealistic. The sister in the story who is suppossed to have an eating disorder didn't seem like she would. Based on her actions and her words I wasn't convinced that she had an eating disorder. It was hard for me to enjoy the book because I kept on saying, ""An anorexic would never say/do that."" The other sister's life was actually interesting though as she delt with her best friend and boy friend."
3,IF YOU'RE ANOREXIC LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR ANSWERS,"I admit that I'm much older than the intended audience for this title (18-21) but I do read a lot of young adult stuff. What captivated me in the book, unfortunately worked against it as well. Billie's unpredictable and flippant behavior pulled the reader along but lacked reason and depth. Admittedly, the dad is a type-A jerk, and the Mom is spineless which makes this family truly dysfunctional, but I just looked for the author to tell me more. I appreciated the author's frank handling of anorexia but anorexics will not find answers in this book. The ending is depressing, help never comes, and the reader is left hanging. Equally disturbing are Billie's sexual experiences - graphic but thoughtless. I suggest Judy Blume's ""Summer Sisters"" for a more honest portrayal of reckless youthful sexuality."
4,"Beautiful TV Stand, but arrived with a large scratch on top","I bought this from target along with a few other Hudson pieces. It looks great and seems to be very sturdy - was very easy to put together with the help of a friend and electric screwdriver. My only problem was when it arrived it had a Large scratch across the entire top piece. Normally I would return, but too much of a hassle and I really do like the TV stand. I have a 42' TV so it covers most of it anyway. Would highly recommend - hopefully it will not arrive with scratches. Also, shipment was VERY fast received it the next day!"
2,Disatisfied with compay service,"The chairs we received are great (but only received 2 of the 3 ordered), the company is non-responsive... we ordered 3 chairs, only received 2 and after trying to contact 3 times have yet to hear back."
4,Jackies Secret Thoughts,"This is pure fiction yet it could have been what she thought about a lot of the things in her life. No whitewashing of the personalities of her husband, brotherinlaw,or father and mother. The companion book to this, Jack's Widow did not hold my interest as long as this one did. It must have been written by a man although the author has a woman's name."
3,Disappointed,"Ok, well I am a big series reader. I love the Redwall series and have read books 1-6. Coming on book 7 I had to do a book report but I didn;t want to do it on the Bellmaker because I would have had to explain the other books and I didn't fell like doing that. So I quit reading the series and yesterday night I finally started with the Bellmaker and finished just now. Well, I was very disappointed. This book was like almos tthe same as Mariel of Redfwall except Joseph was rescuing Mariel besides Mariel rescuing him. Redwall of course was going to get taken over(getting kinda old don't you think) and their best warriors were gone(shocking!). Don't get me wrong the book was great, the desriptions were awesome, just need a new plot system. Goob book in all."
2,Redwall series- The Bellmaker,"I don't understand why people like Redwall so much. Once you've read about three of them you get to realize that the plots are very similar. Redwall was good, that doesn't mean he has to write 12 more! All featuring annoying mice who always win against the rats never losing a important character or even taking many casualties. It's all white and black with no sublety. and these books are so famous? You should read Robin Jarvis's books, who I notice are now being marketed as 'in the tradition of Redwall' although they were published before most of the Redwall books! I don't understand it."
3,"Not the best, but still okay.","This book, for some reason, did not live up to my expectations for a Redwall book. Even though it had great characters, great action scenes,but not a good enough plot to support them. I still would reccomend almost any one of the Redwall books, but this is an exception to the ""almost any one""."
4,pretty good,"Do you like adventure mystery and battles between good and evil ? If you do than you will love The Bellmaker by british author Brian Jacques. In the book the evil foxwolf Urgan Nagru, is sick of the cold northern air. He and his mate, Silvamord, decide to travel south. They set off with their faithful followers, a horde of gray rats. Once the evil fox is satisfied with the warm air, he sets his eyes on the mighty castle floret. This book will captivate children from years ten to !"
3,The Bellmaker a fairly good book,"This is another novel written by Brian Jaques, the Bellmaker is the seventh book in the Redwall series. the story takes place in medievil times where foxes are every things enemy. The Bellmaker story begins by two murderous foxes (Urgan Nagru and Silvamord) which had left Redwall to go somewhere else and happened to run into the Castle Floret where the squirrel king offered to let them stay there with them until they were fit to travel again. One year later Mariel and her friends were sent a message to go travel south. The message said, ""Before the legand, before the glory, the Bellmakers dream foretold the story:five will ride the roaring burn, but only four are supposed to return.We thought the book started out slow but toward the middle it started picking up. Then at the end the book started geting boring and did not start to pick up agian. You should read the first six books, first in order to better understand it better."
5,A Great Book by Brian Jacques,"I really think The Bellmaker is a really good book for people who like adventure books. But, it&#65533;s also sad. When Finnbarr Galedeep died. I almost cried. They stayed on the ship to long that&#65533;s when it got boring. Who would have thought Redwallers would steel."
2,ANOTHER One?,"To be honest, I'm getting fed up with the Redwall series. It features the same plot over and over again. Mice get attacked by evil enemy, there's a crisis, and then the mice miraculously win. Sure, the plot's good, but it gets old a few books in."
1,why would you read these?,"hEy this review is not only for the bellmaker, but for all of the redwall series, i have read them all. If anyone out there thinks brian jaqcues is a great author, think again. these books are all the same, same plotline, same elements, you read one , you read them all. And I also think that he overuses a lot of stuff, like the molespeech, and the bloodwrath. Lets try and keep some realism in this, how could a mouse ever kill a fox, it's impossible, but it happens often, the only book that was good at all, was salamandastron. After reading this review, i hope you will come to your senses and realize that he is not a master of fantasy, more like of immature, childrens books, for fantasy, it is tolkien all the way, the lord of the rings!"
5,It was a really good and adventurous book.,You should read Mariel of Redwall before you read the Bellmaker which I made the mistake of not doing that and reading the Bellmaker.The Bellmaker starts out with Mariel and her brother at Castle Floret. Mariel has a really hard chunk of bread which she would later use to kill a stout trying to hurt a young animal. Later back in Redwall Joseph the Bellmaker and some brave Redwallers to rescue Castle Floret from Foxwolf who had recently captured the castle. This is when the action begins. It is an awsome book if you like when Redwallers get far from Redwall.
2,Not as good as the others,"It really wasn't what I expected from a Redwall book. It was pretty boring and well....I don't know how to say it. I come from reading all the previous book that were just amazing, then I come across Bellmaker and it just didn't leave to much of an impression on me like Redwall, Mariel of Redwall and Martin the Warrior did. Sorry all you people who loved it, but that's what I thought of it."
4,Reeeeeddddwaaalllll,"The bell maker is an amazing peice of work on the half of Brian Jacques.It has everything you could want in a book. It has Mariel the warrior maid who adds a different view on the redwall series as all the other main warrior characters have been male. Then there is the young Dandin the redwall champion who accompanies Mariel on her quest southwards. These two go through fighting virmin,eating the most delious foods and making friends such as Gael the squirrelking,Fwurp the friendly mole and the war hero Meldrum the Magnificent. Together they battle the evil horde of Urgan Nagru to rid the south land of dark evil."
1,one-sided nonsense,"I bought 6 copies of this book for our bookclub. We have all been raised in Christian families, but none of us actively practice any religion. We chose the book because we are all interested in religion and wished to learn more about Islam and the Qu'ran. Not one of us managed to finish the book.It needs to be clear that this book is written by an Evangelical Christian for Christians. ""...Muslims around the world are not so much the enemy as they are people in urgent need of salvation in Jesus Christ."" Oh dear, I'm very sorry I wasted my money."
5,Very Insightful!,An excellent and balanced book. Christopher's knowledge of the history is thorough and his suggestions are challenging. Well worth the read. Dr. Larry Siekawitch
5,Chest Wounds Suck,"I've been a fan of Lee's work since he started doing Chopping Block. All I can say is, if you've been to his site, and enjoy dark humor, pick this book up, you won't be sorry.abe...."
4,A real bargain,"A good introduction to Spanish guitar music, and for this price it is a great bargain. An enjoyable CD."
2,"Good selections, but erratic notes","This revision of Harrington's _Medieval Latin_ includes an excellent choice of texts, elegant illustrations, good introductions to individual selections and a useful grammatical introduction. Unfortunately, Pucci's notes to the Latin passages are often vague or misleading and are riddled with elementary errors. I found teaching from this book an exercise in frustration. Keith Sidwell's _Reading Medieval Latin_ remains the best choice both for college courses and for self-study."
3,it's ok...,"This is the required textbook for my grad program's Medieval Latin class. I am not a medievalist; to a classicist, this seems like a decent selection of ML authors. Apparently the first edition is superior, but the second edition has a much different selection of authors. The notes in this text are sometimes helpful, but frequently incorrect or useless. The typos in the Latin texts and in the notes drive my professor insane."
1,This book neglects the best late Latin!,"Pucci's revision of Harrington's first edition is nothing short of maddening! I was looking forward to an expansion of the late Prof. Harrington's masterpiece only to find the excerpts of Milton, Scaliger, Dante, Pertrarch, and Castiglione removed! If one is interested in German Latin lyricists as well, do not buy this book! It was a grave disappointment!"
2,Not as good as the first edition,"Unfortunately, some of the real treasures of medieval Latin literature, most notably the Dies Irae, which were in the First Edition were removed in this edition, and the additions are of little benefit. Still, a fair collection of medieval works. A solid knowledge of Latin is required to benefit from this book. Not for beginners."
4,the walkmen deconstruct stuff - give them a chance anyway,"If New York is a scene again, then the Walkmen are the Television to the Strokes' VU. Just kidding. Well, sort of. The Walkmen are musically sound. Their diverse bag of influences seems to stem from the same record collection the Strokes had (aka VU, Stooges, Television, Pixies) but throw in a little Radiohead, possibly U2 and more of a leaning to 80s pop than 70s raw. But there are definitely twists to keep it interesting. And while we're talking about influences - who cares if a band is derivative? Hey, we're all Post Modernists here, right? There is no originality in rock (there is innovation). Everybody takes what the last guy did and tries to make it better. The Walkmen, like the Strokes, succeed where many, many others fail."
4,A good policy text,This text is useful for those (like myself) just beginning to learn about policy analysis. I would recommend this to all who are interested in policy analysis.
4,Just fine for purpose it was bought for...,"I bought this CD to use for background sounds for photo slideshows. It is fine for that purpose. The CD I received had a different CD cover, but it seems to be the same CD, just different cover."
4,replace your b/w with this,"replaced the 5th black widow 15"" with this and really love the sound, it stands up to my 70's ampeg v6 great so far"
1,Amazon/Macys Disgraceful!!!!!!!!!!,"This is not a review of the Fossil bag - it is a review of Macys-Amazon and their customer service. I cannot believe I'm being asked to give a review for a product purchased when they never delivered the bag! Their customer service could not be any more lame!!!I ordered the bag, but Macy's/Amazon did not deliver the bag! I received notice FIVE DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS that the bag was no longer in stock. This was after I was initially told the bag was in stock and would ship within a few days. This bag was one of two Christmas gifts requested by my teenage daughter. I was incredibly angry and frustrated upon receiving word the bag would not be sent - understandably, I believe.AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,??? Not sure what you are looking for...... Fredrico Garcia Lorca's ... Poets in New York.....,I was thrilled to recieve this edition.... Not only did it include the edited introduction by Christopher Maurer......giving a comprehensive background of the author's life as he composed these great works..... but also included a series of letters that the poet wrote home during this same period..... that give an entirely different perspective on the man...... and his work. The man's life was troubled.... his poems deep ... and often dark..... but his letters reveal the joy with which he percieved/embraced ... his life experience........ I am delighted by this aquisition!!!
1,Save your money,"Bought these for use at Animal Kingdom at Disney, which, if you've ever been there, is HOT. These kept us cool for about 5 or 10 minutes, literally. Yes, you can rewet them, but they aren't any better than a regular bandana for that purpose. What a disappointment!"
3,Do they or don't they work?????,"Tried them and I don't no if its my imagination but they seem to work a little.The only problem is they never seem to dry completely.after you wash them.Whatever you do ,do not put them away even if there a little damp because they get mildewed.The beads inside seem to settle in clumps."
2,Heat Max cooling bandana,Product arrived but I discovered that the product is not a triangular bandana as I assumed but a tube of cloth filled with a water obsorbing substance. Returned product for a refund and bought a Chilly Pad from Frogg Toggs instead.
1,Disappointed,"I was placing a lot of hope in these bandanas helping me make it through the t-ball games. There are cool to the touch but sweating did not seem to activate them. It just wasn't cool enough to cool me down at all. If you put them in the refrigerator it was much better but they didn't stay that cold for long. In my opinion, they blocked the breeze when there was one."
1,coolmax bandana,"Very disappointed. There is some chemical on this product that gave me quite a bad reaction. It caused insomnia, hyperactivity and a skin eruption like I get when a chemical has me overloaded.Its a great idea but since it is not washable to get this chemical off they will go to someone less sensitive than I."
