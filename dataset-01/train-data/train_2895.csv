3,oppo so so,OPPO DV-970HD Up-Converting Universal DVD Player.I read other reviews on this product and expected a great picture on my new Panasonic plasma 42 inch. Although slightly better than component video connection with regular dvd player I was not that impressed. In addition I tried to play 4-5 discs that I had recorded on a DVD recorder and I was not able to play half of them that were playable in the past. I had the impression that it could read more formats. The tray is fine (I have heard that it is too flexible in past reviews).
5,great DVD player,this was the second one i got. just like this player.. works great.. plays almost everything..
5,oppo dvd player,best buy for the cost. excellent features. great picture quality. before jumping on the unknown hd dvd bandwagon this machine outpreforms all others. sound quality from my previous denon and sony player is superior. paid over $400.00 for the sony now its on a recall..
5,Close to Perfect,"This DVD player is truly astounding. First, it will play absolutely ANYTHING. .avi files from a computer CDROM - no problem. PAL - no problem. Honestly it beat my expectations.Next, the ""upconverting"" output is fantastic. What a difference it makes to see a regular DVD processed by such a high-quality machine.This DVD player is clearly organized, and puts many controls in your hands... how you would like the audio signal processed, or how you'd like the picture processed. The controls are clear and not confusing.The remote feels substantial in the hand.One commenter remarked that the DVD drawer is flimsy... I understand the sentiment, it's very thin. But that appears to be a visual design decision... I don't find it to be particularly flimsy.The unit looks and performs fabulously.I couldn't recommend it more highly."
3,XVID play choppy,"The xvid files i have plays perfectly on PC but when i play on the player they are jerky and choppy.It plays DVD and divx perfectly, but the quality of my divx arent as good as xvid for the same bit rate :(."
2,"Good with Sony, Bad with Pioneer","I've had OPDV971H HD for 2 years in conjunction with Sony Bravia LCD, worked very nicely. Now that I got a better quality Pioneer Plazma it is abvious that the player doesn't produce good picture quality. will be buying something new."
4,Great guy but little slow response,"This guy has a great performance in terms of function and image quality. It provides easy region-free option as well, another great value of this one. However, response time when the button of remote control (particularly open) is pushed is little bit slow and the remote control buttons are too small to use easily in the dark. Sound output amplitude is little bit low, does not match other players such as VHS player output. So I have to volume TV up.Anyway, this is a great multi-regional player and worthy of purchasing at listed cost."
3,DVD player,"So far I love it. It really does make my standard DVDs look fantastic. It doesn't seem to make as big of an improvement on newer movies as it does on older ones. I hope it is reliable, because this DVD player will keep from buying an HD-DVD or a Blu Ray player for quite some time. *UPDATE* After two years of watching on average, one DVD/week, the disc tray no longer likes to eject. At first I had to make sure the disc was completely stopped. Then it would only work if I used the eject button on the remote. Then I had to unplug it for ten seconds and then plug it back in. Now none of these things seem to work anymore. Not impressed for only two years of use."
4,versatile player,"So far it's played every format I've thrown at it and that was the whole reason for me buying it :)It even plays from a USB thumb drive using a 2GB MicroSD memory card. Awesome! The only downside is you have to have the TV on in order to see the song listings or picture menu. (It does have a video off button though)Picture quality is no different than the 7 year old Onkyo DVD player this replaced but I'm not using the HDMI connector since my reciever doesn't support it >:{ Picture quality would probably be noticably better if I could make use of the HDMI.I will say, the remote sucks. The glow-in-the-dark buttons are useless and there is no difference in button shape so it's hard to figure out what button you want to press in the dark.Other than the remote, I'm very happy with this DVD player."
5,Great product,We bought this so we could watch dvd's in hd format. It is wonderful and the cost is relatively inexpensive. Am thrilled to have it.
4,"Surely, not just another run of the mill DVD player!",One of the best buys for a DVD player even at 2x the price. Too bad it's silver and has a 'thin' tray.
4,Stunning but confusing,"I am impressed with the versatility of the 970. SACD's, even though I have to play them through the receiver's analogue 5.1 inputs, sound absolutely stunning.DVD's is another matter. Some DVD's play the previews before the movie with excellent video that is well defined with excellent color and detail. But, when the movie starts, the picture is too dark -- backgrounds are too black. I have tried all the adjustments both on the Oppie and my Dell LCD. Other DVD movies are fantastic without any need for adjustments. Most of my DVDs come from Netflix rentals. So I don't understand the differences. Because of this confusion, I downgraded the star rating to 4. Otherwise, the 970 is a wonderful value both for audio and video."
1,Arrived DOA - won't power up.,"I believed the good reviews, and it's replacement may indeed be an excellent product, but despite fine packaging, the product arrived DOA - wouldn't power up at all. Kinda takes the bloom off the relationship with Oppo."
5,The best customer service ever!,"I have the 971, and I had a problem. I just called Oppo, and they are going to fix the machine for free with free FedEx shipping both ways. The 971 works great, but I think I'm going to get this 970 also -- because of the SACD capability (for ""Dark Side Of The Moon,"" natch).The picture is fantastic, and you don't need any converter for 5.1 surround. Just get a couple of old amps, a powered sub, and a small studio monitor (powered) for the center."
5,Great up-scaling DVD player,"We have a 37"" 720p (and 1080i) LCD tv. We bought this upscaling DVD player to ride out the format wars. The picture is incredible. I can definitely tell the difference between a Blue Ray disc and an up-scaled DVD, but honestly, the difference is probably slight for all but the largest screens. Now that it looks like Blue Ray will be the winner, we will keep our eye out for a nice Blue Ray player to complement the Oppo."
5,excellent,"have not yet connected it with hdmi. however, so far it lives up to all of the very positive reviews. great customer support on the oppo website, too. owner's manual is pretty rudimentary, but there is a lot of info on the mfr website. only thing i've found that could be improved is the cd/dvd drawer. it seems fragile, and you need to reach under it to lift the cd with one finger and pick it up from the tray with the other. otherwise, there is an interference with the edge of the disc and the player. this is very minor once you figure it out. the fact that is comes with all the bells and whistles incl. an hdmi cable, is incredible!"
4,Great DVD player with a few usability problems,"I bought this DVD player because of its ability to play DivX and XviD as well as the ability to output in either NTSC or PAL. It was great for both of these purposes. The DivX scaler is the best I have seen in an external DVD player and it correctly formats for wide televisions. In auto mode it will output in either PAL or NTSC timings depending on the frame rate of the source.Despite the excellent function of the system, there are a couple of minor flaws in this DVD player. The front panel display is very bright and is a distraction if the player is near the monitor. When off, it shows a very bright red LED under the power switch. Both of these seem to be designed for having the unit behind some colored glass, but there is no setting to dim them when they are in the open. I fixed the problem by covering the front panel with some colored plastic. The remote is also not very good. Oppo apparently believes that all of their users have a universal remote."
2,Re-issue blues.,"I was wondering which episodes of Wells Fargo would be included in this new set from Timeless Media.Having now gone to their web site, where all the episodes are detailed, I regret to advise that,as faras I can tell, 39 of them are included in the 6 disc set that Timeless produced in 2009 under the titleof The Best of the First Five Seasons.This is a great pity because I was considering buying this new set. It appears that you are only getting13 new episodes (apart from the tin box that they come in).I will let any prospective purchaser decide whether this new edition is worth it, if they already own theprevious set."
5,Interesting,SF 59 is definitely an acquired taste but well worth taking the time to get to like them. I especially enjoy listening to this cd on starry night time drives on an open highway.
5,Can't believe I found this at such a low price!,"I think this is the best, if not one of two best (Everybody Makes Mistakes) SF59 records. I guess nobody else thinks so. Lucky for me. :)"
2,THE BEST OF WHAT???,"This is not the best of dream dance. I've heard better dream dance songs than most of the songs on here. Further more, a few of the songs on this dream dance album were not even on previous dream dance volumes!! Like ""Hard to say I'm sorry"", the original version of ""Sandstorm"", The original version of ""Dooh Dooh"", and a few others. They could've made this album so much better. 2 stars is what I give it."
2,Not worth buying,I bought this a little less than a year ago and within a couple months of use it began making very loud noises while in use. It just recently started smoking while I was using it. Needless to say it is no longer working. While it is a cheap price - it is not going to last very long. There are better options out there.
4,Worked till it burned up,"It worked for about a year. The cord got pinched and then one day the dang thing caught on fire. My fault for letting it get pinched up. I dont think it was poorly made, however the cord is a bit thin. The new one I got isnt from Toshiba and it rocks. I would suggest this if you cant find anything else."
5,My breakfast fix for years now!!,"A few years ago, I lost 50 pounds and this was a big reason why... a high fiber breakfast that held me for hours! I've used it to keep the weight off, and enjoy how quick and easy it is. Sprinkle it into a bowl, add some water, throw it in the microwave... I enjoy mixing in thick rolled oats, flax meal, bananas, berries, anything for variety when needed... soymilk on top and you're good to go! Love it!!!"
5,Tasty high fiber cereal,"This high fiber cereal is a great way to start the day. Because of its high fiber, it keeps the stomach and the intestines happy and healthy."
2,Really Bad!,"I had high hopes for this cereal based on others reviews. But I was very dissappointed - it's like eating sawdust in my opinion! It would take a whole lot of dried fruit, nuts and sweetener of some kind to make this taste anywhere near yummy. And that doesn't fit in to the kind of diet I'm supposed to eat."
2,Bob's Red Mill Organic High Fiber,"I have always purchased Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Hot Cereal, I wanted to try the high fiber with flax. It is very bland and dense (needs to be mixed with something like the Oat bran cereal or roasted flax and blueberry).I will stay with Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Hot Cereal in the future."
2,healthy with bad taste,"I eat rolled oats mixed with a little breakfast cereal most mornings and thought this would be a great to use to switch things up a little bit. It is probably very healthy but tastes pretty bad, for me. Even if I add just a little bit to my oats or cereal, I can taste the bad flavor. I have tried it with different combinations and I just can't make it taste good. Too bad it was four packages :( At least my order qualified for free shipping..."
4,High Quality Product,"This is a high-quality grain, that is finely ground. It makes a great hot cereal, though I was expecting the texture and grains to be larger (more like oatmeal)."
4,Taste Good But Is Thick,"While I like this cereal, I had a difficult time making it the very first time. The serving size is small, and most of it stuck to the pan, giving me an even smaller serving. I have since adjusted the amount of water in the directions in order to have a less thicker bowl of cereal. Using one cup water helped me acheive this. I would still recomend this product for those looking to increase their fiber and grain intake. Also while simmering for the required 10 minutes, I turn the heat to the lowest point to keep the water from boiling copletely away."
5,Kids love it!,The music is upbeat and tells a story. I think the kids enjoy this and the addition soundtrack more than any of the educational CD's they have. I wish more learning tapes were this creative!
3,"A good songbook, but no CD as advertised...","This is an excellent music book with a wide assortment of movie themes excellenlt arranged with but one minor flaw: the CD that is advertised doesn't exist, leaving me dissappointed. So, if you don't mind not getting a CD, this could be for you."
3,great skate,American Athletic ..... made in China????? I am a little upset that a brand calls itself AMERICAN and has the audacity to have the product line made in China kind of an oxymoron!! (hence the 3 out of 5 stars)Anyway great skates and my daughter loves them and that is all that matters!
5,Truth revealed,"And we wonder why health is deteriating...It is so sad what is happening to farmers, food and our bodies and health."
5,A must see for everyone who values their health!,"Very eye opening documentary on the injustice to our farmers, our health and well-being. My family has been organic supporters for over 20 years and I am so glad we chose that path so long ago. I hope this opens people's eyes and they make changes within their own lives and take back control of our food sources."
1,raises some good issues but is very one sided,I have followed the area of transgenic plants for a while now and there are valid claims by both sides of the arguement. This video raises some of the issues but is very one-sided and does not talk about the good things that may come from using transgenic plants. I also thought the video ganged-up on Monsanto a little unfairly. I thought the video was more about corporate bashing than the actual issue of transgenic crops. There is another side to the issue. You may want to watch History's Harvest.
1,The Future of Food,"Again, I bought this for High School Culinary Arts classes. The movie is slow and does not hold the attach of the students."
4,The filmmakers have a newer version,"The Future of FoodOn the filmmaker's website, they are claiming that this version is from a distributor that has not lived up to their contract. The filmmakers are offering a 2-disc special edition home version that is cheaper, and there are convenient license options for public showings. I don't like getting in the middle of a legal dispute, but I'd prefer to stay on the side of the artists until it is resolved."
4,Bad Food,"Wow. It's worse than I thought...and I knew it was pretty bad (the food situation that is, not the movie.) The movie sheds a lot of light on the perpetrators of diabolical food modification. Our own government is one of the culprits. The movie is very educational."
5,taking your head out of the sand,"We can no longer pretend we have no link to our environment and the plants and animals that provide our nourishment. If you value your role in the health of our planet, and in the health of yourself and your children, then this is a must-see documentary. We are headed in the wrong direction in ignorance of our food chain. Re-connect to the earth, improve your health, nourish your soul and make a difference in this lifetime."
5,Painless way to learn the painful truth,Great film that tells us what we need to know about the mess our food supply is in... and how to get out.
5,Excellent Material.,Book was in excellent condition upon arrival. It is a useful resource while preparing for the certification examination as a Certified Hazardous Materials Manager.
2,Mediocre at Best,"The programming is second rate. It is nice to have 5 book on the CD, but as a Software Engineer/Programmer and a V:tM ST, the search features need work, the overall lethargic feel of the app could be improved, the fact that it is a full screen app really makes it cumbersome as a quick reference (why didn't they just do it in window view?), the character generators are okay, but there are easily better freeware available, the book text and the fonts used are flawed and hard to read on some pages (overlapping of text), a non-standard and second rate installation process, tedious menu selection steps, the extras are neat, but don't make up for the rest of the CD's lacking. I think WW should let me rewrite the software, then it might be worth the 50 dollars they want for it. (Even at Amazon's ..., it is not worth the money)"
2,VERY FLAWED,"A first for White Wolf! A potentially great product BOTCHED by the half-baked efforts of the programmers. If you want the 5 included books, than this is a great product (though the scroll, and search features are flawed), but if you are looking for the character generator, save your money. It sure as hell ain't worth it."
3,Average Text Book,Not a difficult textbook to read however my professor did point out a couple of errors the made in the the time line.
4,Very interesting and insightful,"I like Verlyn Flieger's works on Tolkien very much. I've read her other two books and was impressed with them as well. This particular volume concentrates more on the 'Silmarillion' than on the 'Lord of the Rings', but still gives a very good overview for the serious Tolkien student. Recommended for anyone looking for a good, scholarly, discussion on Tolkien, his worldview, and his creative process, with emphasis on the First Age - but not to exclude those who are primarily interested in the events of the Third Age, as Ms. Flieger ties all three ages together well in her discussion."
2,He wasn't a very good poet.,"I admire Mattie for having the strength and personality that he did. Seeing himself as a peacemaker make me respect him even more. He had a very hard life, and he tried to make the world better. However, in all honestly, some of the poems in this book look like something that would come out of my third grade writing portfolio. If he hadn't been disabled, and didn't have all of the publicity he had, he never would have made it as a poet. This is another example of how society isn't fair. I've been writing poems my whole life, and none of them will ever get noticed or praised, because I'm not, as you would say, 'special.' like Maddie was. R.I.P Maddie. I mean nothing offensive by what I just said, I'm just stating the cold hard facts about society and fame."
3,"Hi, I'm the devil's advocate.","Ok, ok... calm down everyone. This book is pretty good and can be touching, but honestly, does no one else feel a slight sense of forcedness? Doesn't it feel like he's hiding from his pain just a little bit? I'm open to feedback here, but this is honestly the vibe I got. Not that I don't feel compassion for the kid, nor have I had as hard a life as he, but I do know that the best way to achieve love and world peace is to go THROUGH your pain, not try to shove it aside."
5,One of God's Little Angel,"Mattie, I can see what a kind, caring, spirit, you have when I saw you on TV. Reading about and looking at you on TV let me see his inner spirit. God has a job for him to do to show us that we can go on with our lives. He is special I know to his mother. I have listen to him on the TV and he is telling us a lot if we/you listen to what he is telling us. Mattie, I am also disable, but I refuse to let anything stop me from writing. I hope you will be happy and you can make others happy through your writing. Keep up the good work. God bless you and your family Mattie."
3,No Box??,The muffler looks like it will work but it came without a box. The muffler was scratched and dented and was laying on the cement in the rain when I got home. The manufacturer stuck stickers all over the metal. I always bought flomaster and every muffler I bought came in a box. Not happy with the shipment....
2,"Cute, but boring","Fashionistas was a quick read, good for the subway. I never felt like I had to read on to the next page or chapter. The main character, Vig, follows suit with many other fictional heroines like Bridget Jones, or Becky from Confessions of a Shopoholic, she's a young urban woman working in a trendy professional setting, sadly she's just not as interesting as her literary contemporaries. The book is structured around the heroine and her colleagues attempting to get their boss fired. Unfortunately everything that happened, even the twist at the end, was fairly predictable. Her love interest is cute sub-plot, but could have been developed more. It's a good mindless read for the beach or the commute, but not the most memorable book."
2,Meh,"Not all that interesting. I found that it kinda jumped around a bit, too. The way the characters were introduced wasn't clear enough, and there was one particular character that she spent a chapter talking about that wasn't really critical to the plot."
4,Great Book About Mary Magdalene,"Mary Magdalene is the star of this book. She appears with her childhood friends Jesus, Joanna (wife of Chuza), and Susanna. She is healed from her demonic ""fits"" and follows Jesus afterwards. This book is great! However, there is not much in the Bible about this woman, and my idea of her is slightly different than Ms. Bremkamp's. I could only give 4 stars."
4,No problems,"Well, I have no miracle news for this product, but use it successfully in conjunction with calcium citrate with no side effects. No dehydration, no weird tastes, small enough pill to swallow easily."
2,Now Foods Bone Strength,I believe Now Foods have great products. However Bone Strength did hurt my stomach even when taken with food. Since I have osteoporosis I take a whole food vitamin/supplement with calcium and magnesium because that is the best. The brand that I recommend is PhytoVitamins because that brand does NOT hurt my stomach.
5,* Clear to Learn.!!,"if you are Christian who has no idea what is 'Assurance of Salvation', this is the Book that you need to read.!!"
3,Not Everyone's Cup of Tea,"This is quite a deep book which looks at love, theology, politics and autism, through the eyes of Edgar Schneider, misdiagnosed with schizophrenia in middle age and only correctly diagnosed as autistic in retirement in 1995. In his first book, `Discovering my Autism' he tells of his life and how his diagnosis came about, and begins to explore some of the topics this second book covers in greater depth. There are things I disagree with him on, but I respect this book because I think autistic thought and philosophy has a place in emerging autistic culture. I enjoyed the gentle and reflective pace, and was very pleased to discover an interesting collection of appendices filled with recipes, sonnets, and brief explorations of metaphysics and ethics. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's thought provoking... people who don't like thinking and prefer to just be told stuff probably won't enjoy it or like what they think it's telling them."
4,Tenchi Universe... a great info book,"This is a great book for any Tenchi fan. Is has great character bios and episode summaries. Unfortunatley it is in black and white, but other than that is a great boook. I reccommend it to all those tenchi freaks out there! (Just like me!)"
3,This is okay,"This was an okay book. I really thought it would be as good as the last one they made for Tenchi Muyo!. It was in black-and-white which was a flaw, but over all I guess it is fine. The first one was done much better, thought."
3,Get Tenchi Muyo RPG and Resource Book instead,"I'd like to rate this book higher, but I had such high expectations based on Guardians of Order's superb production values in the Tenchi Muyo RPG and Resource Book that I couldn't help but be disappointed in this black and white episode summary. Then again, it's like comparing Tenchi Universe to the Tenchi Muyo OVA series. Anyhow, if you're a Tenchi fan (like I am), and have all the Tenchi series and movies (like I do), you'll want the book to make your collection complete (like I did)."
3,Narrower than the Powerstep Pinnacle,"I have been using the powerstep Pinnacle for a few years, in Mens 11.5 size. i thought i would try the Original version. Please note that the section in the toe area is narrower on the original vs the Pinnacle. In most of my shoes (and my shoes are of normal width) my big toe would fall on the edge of the insole, with a gap between it and the edge of the shoe. This is very uncomfortable and caused a small cut when I used them in running shoes.In order not to throw them away, i cut them down to half size, and matched them with the shoes original insert.Back to the Pinnacles"
3,Very hard and not comfortable,"I was surprised that this item got so many 5-star reviews and I found them to be so uncomfortable. They are very hard to walk on. The arches are very high, so in my opinion they are best suited for those with high arches. My arches are fairly normal. I found the Powerstep Pinnacle to be much more comfortable and I would recommend spending the little bit extra to get those."
3,It's fair,It worked great for a couple months at most . I still wear them anyway despite having pain again. I think they are way better than any you can get at walmart etc. very good quality
3,not much support,These inserts are close to what comes with a slightly (better) athletic shoe. Pro Techs power step is a better buy for my feet. Amazon wanted to charge freight so I ordered these. I use them but not for joggingg
3,"Supports are not necessarily ""insoles""","The key word in the product is ""support."" These supports are hard-formed and pretty inflexible, so if you want something somewhat softer and with a bit more give, look elsewhere. My intention was to get something for my walking shoes, and these are not really well-suited for general walking."
5,The Sad Account of A Cuba that remains to this day without her Freedom.,"One day La Patria will be free.. This book exposes the regime from the start, how a psychopath like fidel took advantage of a situation, and how he was and is a utter failure. People who think Batista was as bad, fidel is worst, Sadly Cuba went from one Dictatorship with some trouble to Another Dictatorship more vicious with a true tyrant."
3,Amazon is a great experience,"I have bought several items from Amazon. Each time, I have had wonderful service. I usually get supersaver shipping and it arrives fast. About the book, at first I was excited because of the weight and size of the book. It is small and doesn't weigh much. Then I opened it. The type is small which means a lot of words on the pages which make it hard to read. There is too much information. It is hard to keep it all straight. I have asked other students in my class if they understood the first reading, only to get the same answer, it is hard to understand. Each reading does get easier, but it has too much information on each page and it is hard to keep it all straight. I only bought this book because it is the required reading for my class. Good Luck to those who need this book."
5,Great Discovery for Me!,"I'm a huge fan of the 80's music...New Order, Depeche Mode, The Cure...(oops just gave away my age) I came across this music when I was searching for similar bands to New Order (via google search)...I just wanted to find some new current stuff to listen to. Of all the newer bands, these guys blew me away. Zune Marketplace has all their albums. Go buy a Zune and enjoy all of them. This band broke up unfortunetly...One member is now Frozen Plasma."
4,A capella bliss,"A great concept for an album: One of the greatest a cappella groups of all time, recorded in an acoustically perfect setting before a most appreciative audience. A wonderful mix of standards, oldies, and gospel songs, brought to life by five remarkable vocalists. A thoroughly enjoyable listen from start to finish."
5,Collector!,"I love Bratz dolls and I hope to add this doll and the rest of the Sweet Dreamz Dollz to my Bratz collection! Kumi is so pretty!I love collecting Bratz dolls but it is so tiring, it's like everytime you think you have them all they come out with new ones (though they're so cool!)Also, I wish the Barbie/Bratz war would stop. I still have all of my Kelly dolls! I still remember getting my first Barbie, Gymnastics Teresa! It rocked! Both are very fun Bratz are much cooler but Barbie was an experience to have!"
2,Short Lived,"I purchased this machine as an ""upgrade"" from my previous all-in-one HP unit. While the set up was easy, and the printing was an upgrade, the unit has stopped being able to send or receive faxes within 8 months.Unfortunately HP ""customer service"" has been less than helpful in this matter, and has thus far (after 3 hours with them on the telephone) not agreed to honor their 1 year warranty.I will NEVER purchase another HP printer again."
5,frame rocks,I read all the reviews before purchasing and it paid off. I am very happy with this frame and carry it around with me like a prized possesion. Sure it doesn't have sound and can't play movies (only does jpg files) and there were some slight file naming issues but it displayed every jpg after renaming or resizing some of the weird ones. It has a sensor (I guess) that knows when it's in portrait or landscape position which also confused me a bit. Overall good quality.
1,Extremely DIsappointing,"This product is poorly designed and very frustrating. I bought one, and upon realizing that it had somehow malfunctioned, my mother bought another one upon the recommendation of someone at phillips support only to have the same problem with the new one. It is virtually impossible to disconnect because as soon as you complete the necessary procedures of proper disconnection, the icon pops up on your desktop again, meaning that the frame is still somehow connected, and therefore will not transfer photos effectively. In addition, it took my 10 minutes just to connect the usb cable to the frame because the input is in a very awkward position. In Summary, i feel frustrated that i have wasted so much time trying to figure out something that should be so simple but is really just a piece of crap."
5,First cookbook I turn to!,"Whether I am giving a large party or just cooking for one or two, I find myself turning to this cookbook first - all the recipes are excellent. Glad this Austin secret is now avaiable to a larger audience!!"
5,Truly a NECESSITY for EVERY KITCHEN,"This would make a GREAT GIFT for: teachers, college grads, newlyweds, neighbors, out-of-town guests...the list goes on!!!! This cookbook is for ANYONE who cooks! There are kids recipes (both edible and not), kitchen tips and conversion charts, napkin folding and place setting guidelines, event planning tips and recipes...oh, and I don't want to forget the DELICIOUS RECIPES!!! The Spinach Meatloaf is divine and the Chicken Enchiladas are like ""real"" Mexican food (just use corn tortillas instead of flour). THIS IS A MUST GET!!!! Pair it with AUSTIN ENTERTAINS (another fabulous cookbook from the Austin Junior League) for a great gift - to you or someone else!"
5,Best CD in years,This is the best CD that I have listened to in years! It hardly ever comes out of my CD player. It touches me in a new way every time I listen. WOW!
5,Absolutely stunning,"This is one of the most inspirational CD's I've ever heard. Fresh, passionate sound & lyrics that really touch you deep within. Highly recommended. Don't pass this up."
4,circulation,I had to wear these gloves quite a fewtimes before I could give them a fair rating. If you have poor circulation like myself the gloves will take a few minutes to work. I had to wait for the blood to start flowing through my fingers once that process is complete the gloves kicked in and keep my hands fairly warm through my run
4,Great for running in the cold,"I use these for running in the cold. I found the large are a little long in the fingers, but they stretch out nice. I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't use a touch screen phone and wants to keep warm on days between 25 and up. Anything below 25 requires some mittens."
4,mizuno thermal gloves really do breathe through,"Lightweight for cool weather outdoor activities. Just as described, not for full on storms but will keep your hands dry and comfortable"
2,"Raynaud""s Syndrome = do not work","I purchased these at the recommendation of the local running store. They told me these gloves were ""the best"" in terms of keeping fingers warm. I have Raynaud's, which is basically just poor circulation to the fingers and toes and they get cold very easily. These did not work on me in cold conditions. The temp this morning was 24 degrees and this is the first run where they did not work for me. When it was a bit warmer in the mornings last week, they worked ok. Will keep them for warmer than 24 degrees days! Still looking for the gloves that work in extreme weather"
3,Good but...,"They are great, my hands are really small so the smallest size still had a bit of extra room at the finger tips. Other than that a great pair of running gloves :)"
2,Amazon is Swell,"I have given this product two stars. The gloves are just fine, but my prior review did not make the censors happy, so now I have taken my review down to a two. Don't worry though, the gloves are as advertised. Hopefully this review passes the Amazon censor test."
3,"Okay, but not great","The gloves keep your hands fairly warm, but my fingertips still freeze for the first couple of miles I run, then my hands start to sweat. Considering they were almost $30 (counting shipping) I was disappointed."
4,Gloves are the best,"I love these gloves. The only thing I would make note of is the size. I got the small and they are still a little big on me. Not unwearable, but not as snug as I would like. I have small hands though so it's probably more my problem and not the gloves."
2,NOT impressed,These do NOT keep my hands warm while running in the cold. It's not even close to freezing temps either. Disappointed
1,Alien gloves,"My husband and I have both tried these gloves and they don't fit either of us. Although the gloves fit nicely on our hands, the fingers are extremely long (we term them ""alien gloves"" for this reason)."
3,Great for cold runs,These gloves do a great job of keeping your hands warm on those 40-50 degree days. I wouldn't give them a shot in freezing temps. But in the late winter in central Japan they held up fine. Their main feature is that they block the wind and keep some of your body heat in your hands. After a few miles of running my hands got warm enough that I had to take them off. They're also handy as an inner liner for any other gloves you have.Buy them for running and use them as a glove liner as well.
2,didn't last,My son used these in middle school and they were fine. But now in high school I've already gone through two this year. With a heavier load of books they don't seem to last. Going to try the mesh and pvc and see if they hold up longer.
1,Ripped within 1 month,This ripped within one month of my son's use at school. This was a total waste of my hard-earned money.
3,Good shipping so so product,"Needed one of these for my son's school year. I learned the hard way that you should always buy two. These are almost impossible to find locally so it forces you to go online. The problem with them is the fact that they are indeed plastic. You WON'T get a full school year out of one. It's not that these bags are made poorly but just how long can you expect one to last after several months of a 12 year old's abuse? Eventually the tiniest tear morphs into a huge one almost over night. The polymer plastic just doesn't hold the stitching over time. Also, once they start to go there's no repairing/patching them, they are trash. A notebook or two, some gym clothes, ect, ok. You put a few full size books, 4-5 marble composition books and a package of paper and you better hold your breath. Again not bad but don't expect a full year out of them."
3,Serves the purpose,"I need a clear bag for work, this does the job. I don't think it could handle a lot of weight but that is not an issue for me. If it's not too full it doesn't zip well, it gets all bent and contorted."
2,"Did not last, easily ripped","I bought this backpack for my daughter to use in Middle School. Outside of normal use, she did not abuse the backpack or overfill it with books. Within one month, the bottom began to tear and now the rip has grown so large, the backpack is no longer usable as we cannot repair it. For the price, this should have lasted more than a month. We are very disappointed in the quality of this product."
2,Zipper brokeon first use,"I was so pleased with the sturdiness of the plastic when it arrived. Unfortunately, the zippers in the large main compartment came off track and would not close from either direction. The backpack hung open the entire week and was truly useless to me. I will be returning it."
1,Disappointed,A zipper broke the very first day. So disappointed. My daughter put her books in it...pulled the zipper and it literally broke off in her hand. Did not even make it to school.
1,Terrible,Just bought this back pack for my 11 year old daughter a couple weeks ago an it already ripped all along the bottom seams.. It is very cheap. She was very disappointed.
2,Disappointing,"I needed to have a clear bag for work. But the mesh on the front got torn after only a few days and it wasn't long until the mesh pocket was just unusable. To top it off, the bag itself now has tears and holes in it. Durable is the exact opposite of what I would describe this product as. I do not recommend it. I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews."
1,Don't waste your time,Well today I shipped my second backpack back to Amazon. The first one arrived Christmas Eve (it was supposed to be a gift) with a LARGE tear in the bottom. The second backpack arrived this week with a LARGE tear in the top. The plastic is brittle and both backpacks almost appeared to have been slashed with a box cutter. Very disspointing. Thankfully Amazon makes returns easy.
1,Disappointing,"My son started middle school this year, where clear backpacks are required. I was happy to find this one on amazon that was well rated and affordable. However, it is only the sixth week of school and my son brought it home on Friday with a huge hole in it. It's right at the seam on the bottom, which points to lack of sturdy construction. I'm now looking for one to replace this one."
1,Do not buy!!!!!1!!!!!11!1!!!ONE!!!!,Do not buy this back pack!!!! First of all it get rips if u hav like 4 notebooks ._. Im in 8th grade and now everyone is stealing stuff from and its really annoying!
5,Durable backpack,This is a durable backpack. It is now half way through the school year and this backpack has held up. More and More school requires that backpacks have to be clear so they can see what is inside.
5,Savoring Solitude,"This is a book for everyone who has stuggled with the ambivalence of solitude. Many of us fear it, some embrace it. These are compelling stories from people who have discovered the growth and insight that can spring from being alone. And one of the most interesting of these journeys is that of the author himself. I found his wit and wisdom most wonderful and was sorry to finish it."
5,Amazing!!!,Accurate and enlightening. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is unsure about why they feel stuck in a cycle of repetitive behaviour and thought patterns.
5,Transitioning Logical Skeptic stunned by accuracy...,"Trials and tribulations thought my life at age 41 now. Transition that have clearly happened in the past 1.5 years by positive and negative influences BEFORE ever hearing of, or reading this book... is and are almost identical in this book. If you've been a skeptic your entire life and or considered yourself a logical and realistic person, and you're now even thinking about 'should I purchase this book', you've already taken the step to open your mind to what you may not know about YOU. ... if not listening to me, listen to your inner self..."
2,Not worth the money.,"This book is a whole bunch of writing the same thing over and over and over and over again but with synonyms. If it was only a dollar I would have rated it higher because it could be a dollars worth of entertainment. But no, I would not buy this book ever again."
4,Good Book and very insightful,I'm not so much into numerology but this book has a lot of insight and makes you think about some things. I agree with what it said regarding my birthdate and number and have adapted some things from it in my life. A good tool to use to reflect on changes and to make some good changes too.
4,The Life You Were Born to Live,"This book was utilized in a class that I attended, thus I was aware of the book's content before I purchased. I like the information and the style. The book addresses who we are at our core based on numerology. It discusses personality traits, positive qualities and inherent challenges. It is a book I will refer over and over."
2,Disappointed,"After watching the movie, Peaceful Warrior, which I enjoyed, I looked up Dan Millman's published work and ordered two of his books. This book is mainly about a numeric code which supposedly describes the personality (I didn't see myself in my 'numeric sequence'). If I had the time and energy I would return this book. Very disappointed."
1,"A ""twinkie book"": cream filled, NO value or substance at all","For a man who wrote so poignantly in Peaceful Warrior, this book is a terrible ghost. It is a ghost because it summarily lacks ""SUBSTAMCE"" of ANY type. This so called work is a tragic mockery to an authors potential talents. Upon reflection, the question becomes, was this author the same person who wrote Peaceful Warrior? Let's certainly hope not. Uggggh....."
2,Outdated. Can't be used for some birthdates after 2000.,"I was disappointed because the book did not have the ""numbers"" for my son's post-2000 birthdate.The book is written for those born in the 20th century only.I guess an update is in order."
5,Want to know where you'te going?,"OMGosh if you're struggling with where you're going, you have got to get this book. It's also helpful to look at other significant relationships in your life and what might be going on with them. If you're open, you WILL get something out of this book."
1,disappointing book,I was not impressed when I read the 'life purpose' of myself and some other people I know very well. The delineations did not match (quite on the contrary) and if they occasionaly did this seemed to be mere coincidence. You may be curious to read something about your life purpose and read the book but don't take it all too seriously. With this book you still won't know (in advance) what your life purpose is. The possibilities are enormous: so just keep your head cool.
1,Probably one of the least informative...,"Over the past 2 or 3 years I have read a fair number of books of this genre, as I am very interested in helping guide others, especially youngsters, on a path to a satisfying, productive, creative, happy life.I could not get through this book, to be frank. By far the least effective, least informative, full of numerology b.s. book I have held in my hands. If you are into numerology you may have a different opinion. To me this was a total waste of good money.Sorry Mr. Millman, I could not possibly derive anything of value from what I believe to be pure rubbish."
3,Not the best book to buy for 3D Studio Max,"For the price of the book, you would expect some great tutorials and explanations on 3D Studio Max. However, it skims over many things and tells you to just type in some numbers and draw some lines without explaining why you are doing certain important tasks. It's supposed to be an animation book primarily, but it does not contain that many chapters on animation. In addition, the chapters on modelling with the program are weak in that they show you how to model things that have no use in the real world. Instead of this book, buy Inside 3D Studio Max. It is a huge book that explains a lot more about this complex program for about the same price. Some positives of this book are that shows you how to do some special effects like explosions and rain quickly, and the steps were fairly easy to follow. However, a website would have been helpful for updates to the book."
4,this way,anne murray is one of the finest female entertainters of alltime. i have collected all 31 albums and have started on hersignature series. her persona and talent take you to placesthat she can only take you to through her intense voice andstyle. her long and successful career will long be cherishedi can't imagine the musical world without her. she is the geatest.
5,Authentic while contemporary,Bryanna Clark Grogan does it again - demystifies great tasting vegan food for those of us who want to be able to cook at home and enjoy flavors that may have seemed only available from restaurant chefs. The instructions for home made seitan are worth the price of the book itself.
2,Slightly disappointed,"This book wasn't what I hoped for since we rarely buy tofu, tempeh, which plays major role in most of the recipes in this book. I prefer to stay away from GMO products, which the soybeans are made from in this country unless you buy them from health store."
5,for those pursuing a vegetarian life style,"Authentic Chinese Cuisine For The Contemporary Kitchen offers a superbly developed compendium of vegetarian Chinese recipes similar to those found in a Buddhist restaurant. Bryanna Grogan brings her expertise to bear in offering delicious, nutritious recipes for homemade ""Mock Meats""; savory snacks and appetizers; dumplings and breads; rice; noodles, soups, and sauces; stir-fried dishes; braised, steamed, and stewed dishes; and even sweets. From Shanghai Spring Rolls, Mandarin Pancakes, and Savory Rice Porridge, to Duck Sauce, Buddha's Delight, and Walnut Cookies, Authentic Chinese Cuisine For The Contemporary Kitchen will quickly became a personal and family favorite for those pursuing a vegetarian lifestyle."
5,Well written,"The author has done a lot of research on Chinese cooking. I'm from a Chinese family and I can see lots of useful, quasi-family-secret cooking tips from my grandparents mentioned in this cookbook. I do think this book deserves the word ""authentic"" in its title, though the authenticity of the flavors depends on personal preference. I think a few of the dishes could be pushed further to match traditional Chinese palates. But overall, this book is indeed a very helpful tool for people living in the western world to become a master in Chinese cooking."
2,Its a squeeler when you first start it up,Replaced the factory belt with this belt.2006 Nissan Frontier 4.0 literThe belt is a squeeler until it breaks in.The belt backing is a slick rubber backing compared with the semi rough backing on oem.This belt may work great on other vehicles other than the 2006 Nissan Frontier.Its getting better as far as the squeeling when you first start the truck up.Dayco may reconsider changing the back of the belt to a semi rough.The belt is quiet after it warms up alittle.
2,its not worth buying cd,this cd is trash i brought this cd last summer and i was hot because pac had maybe 1 or 2 songs on the cd and sum of the artist is not on the cd trust me dont buy this cd
5,This toy really made us laugh!,"Imagine my suprise when I picked up the package and it started talking to me. I knew at once it was Bubba. He turns himself on if he detects any kind of vibrations. We stuck Bubba to the car window today. My 7 year old really loves him. He says lot of fun things like ""C'mon give me the wheel, I'm driving."", ""Detour, ah you missed it"", and every parent's all time favorite ""Are we there yet?"". Bubba pretty much talks nonstop. He does turn himself off (sleep mode) if he cannot detect any motion for a certain period of time. You'll know he is going into sleep mode when he starts to snore. We've only had Bubba for one day but I enjoy him as much as my child does."
3,The artwork says it all.,"With the ""Purple Bottle"" and ""Grass"" references (both live up to their names by the way) and the artwork as well, I was expecting a little more brain-melting power. A little more subdued than I was hoping for, but there are some definite highlights: the two songs mentioned above. First and last tracks as well."
4,Dense,"The primary focus of this band seems to be on atmosphere, wich in my opinion is great!Generally, the songs on 'Feels' are very dense and slow, making for great music to just sit, and relax too. Layers of synths are stacked very cleverly on lush piano melodies, and other odd instruments. The music generally pulses from a soft melody to a roaring climax and then back into semi-ambience. Though sometimes the melodies border into boring territory, there is always plenty to listen to in 'Feels'.'Feels' is very hard to classify. There is plenty of experimentation, and emotion in this music, but at some points its almost ambient.A very soothing and interesting release, but nothing very revolutionary. If you are looking for catchy pop tunes, then this is definately not for you, but if you want some good experimentation and are not afriaid of ambience, then definately check Animal Collective out."
5,yes! yes! yes!,"what an inspiration!*feels* is like splashing in big muddy puddles with your red wellies on ...it's like fireworks exploding in the sky..volcanoes erupting and molten lava sploshing across the earth's surface...it's like a huge splash of rainbow dazzling the sky on a cloudless day...it's like holding hands with your favourite person and swinging so high on a swing, that your feet can touch the clouds...Feels make me feel!it makes me gooey & hot and happy!like a balloon , i wanna fly!"
4,"If you get it, you get it","And if you don't, you don't. This isn't the sort of band that people will universally be drawn to. However, if you given them a shot and listen for a while, you may find that you have stumbled upon some of the most creative music you'll hear in a long while. This is one of those groups that is really hard to describe, so I won't even try to explain their folky,psychedelic sound. I'll just say that it's worth giving a chance."
1,whether or not you want to admit it....,"...these guys are sounding more and more like they want to be the greatful dead. That is fine if you are into that noodly, sloppy hippie crap, but I am getting so bored listening to this album. I was really excited about these guys when Here comes the indian came out, because it was really ambient but also concise. Their sound has gotten way too hokey now, and pretty soon they'll be writing showtunes."
1,what?,"i'll edit this now that i've calmed down a bit and be a bit more to the point; you want to hear something earth shattering, primal, experimental with odd time signatures that dips into a wide array of genres as this record is reported to have done? then listen to some captain beefheart...you may even see why i feel(s) that this record is tripe, because there is experiemental and then there is bad, bad, directionless, meandering, pretentious ""music""."
3,Freak Ambient Spacegrass,"This is one of the most bizaroo records I've heard in awhile. I'm not sure it's more accessable than Sung Tongs, but it is certainly worth a listen. The spacey songs may take a little getting used to, especially when they are placed back-to-back. But the faster tunes are a Brian Wilson meets Bill Monroe electric freakout."
2,Mix it up!,"Take the worst parts of:David Baker era MERCURY REVTHE WOLF GANG PRESSROLLERSKATE SKINNYTHE BEACHBOYSCANDEAD CAN DANCEandSHADY,Put them in a blender, set it on ""wow, aren't we crazy!?"", poor mixture into the glass of an overly hip, indier than though hipster, and then smash the glass over the hipsters head. The resulting sound of glass breaking and hipster crying will sound better than this wannabe band."
2,"They were labelled ""creative"" as children","I have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner's music class, and I will call it art. People will write many reviews about the music, and they will say it is wonderful, and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages. They will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks. Music is not suppossed to hurt the ears. To call this good music is an insult to good musicians.I will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer, for clearly they were higher than a kite, no, make that a weather ballon, when they composed the album.Creative; maybe. Listenable, enjoyable, humable, playable when company is over; no."
1,autometer adapter,part broke as soon as i was installing it. and the customer service was impossible to deal with. ill never buy from here again.
1,Which way?!,"This book has a catchy title, it just begs that an ""unsuspecting protestant"" may pick up this book and read and reason into realizing that their faith is in vain, repent and head for the nearest orthodox church. Scott Hahn (fundamentallist to catholic) also has a lot to say that points out the lack of substance or basis for protestant christianity (well o.k. I guess their really saying that it can't be christianity). But which one is it then? Catholic or Orthodox? It seems that this is an very interesting argument for churchmen. But those who believe that Jesus had a mission beyond setting up an earthly ecclesiastical order and institution will sense the bluntness of the letter of the law.I would recommend this book for anyone who is drawn to the orthodox church and wants to be further convinced and justified. As far as making the claim ""The Way"" . . . Jesus is still the way, - plus nothing!"
4,Protestants need to know,"Mr. Carlton is a former seminarian from the southern baptist convention tradition. He explain his rather intence dissatisfaction with the SBC which led him to examine the numerous christian dictrines of theology. He raises many questions that all hardcore protestants should ask themselves. However, a protestant with a casual interest might be put off by Mr. Carltons zealousness for orthodoxy. There is also a companion speech by Mr. Carlton on CD. Clark Carlton has also written ""The Truth: What every Roman Catholic should know about the Orthodox Church"" and ""The Faith: Understanding Orthodox Christianity."""
5,"A lot of fun for kids, practical if needed for adults.","I bought one for my niece after she became attached to one of my more expensive, ""adult,"" versions that cost a bit more.She LOVES it; she's two, almost three years old, but knows how to and understands the idea of the switches and different settings. Unfortunately she'll probably learn how to open the battery compartment too, but that's her mom's concern. It's good too, in that it comes batteries included. It works great as a regular flashlight if needed, also, but its colors and design are geared more towards kids.As far as the red light supposedly reflecting off the animal's eyes, I hope she doesn't get that close to our wildlife since she lives in the city and city ""wildlife"" aren't the safest or friendliest.I would've given it five stars all across the board, but we haven't had it long enough to test it's durability."
5,Wow!,"Poor Claudia. She's lost her best friend, her world isn't the same anymore. I feel pretty sorry for her. She's got to be lonely. But this was a great book. It shows the problems teens face today and isn't strictly about the BSC. This is LIFE. Things like this happen. Fights over boyfriends, girlfriends, losing best friends, your world changing all around you. I'm glad Ann is focusing that in her new series now. Keep up the good work Ann!"
4,Stacey is such a..... poor Cluad......,"I could not believe Stacey,AT ALL!She is so boy-crazy,such a snob,and she always seems to get what she wants. Cluadia wants to be her friend again...or at least tries to. And all Stacey does is act like a big b-word! It's like she doesn't care about Claudia anymore,only Jeremy. Claudia and Jemery were made for eachother. I can't believe Stacey has him. Well,Claudia's found a new friend. Erica. She's adopted and she wants to know who are her biological parents. And Claud totaly understands how she feels because she used to think she was adopted. They become good friends...until Cluad calls her ""Stacey"" by mistake and can sometimes only talk about Stacey. Claud and Stace almost made up but then Stacey screwed up."
4,"Cool shoe, Great Fit","women's Pinger flat Tsubo - smart ankle strap, does not confine. Well built, good arches. Smart look - aerated. Built for great look, fit and comfort. Quality - Tsubo through and through."
3,Tsubu pinger,I was a little disappointed when I received these shoes. They look so feminine in the picture but they are clunky and hot.
5,Wicked cute!,"Got these recently - they're wicked cute and run about true to size and I need more colors as soon as I can! Wanted a nice skimmer style without too much clutter - I don't care for bows and buckles on the toes like so many ballet-style flats have. The ankle strap is sweet - it's a stretch fabric material, some of the pictures make it look like leather, but it's not - and it holds your foot in the shoe nicely, so walking is a breeze. Love the slightly squared toe, too. Looks great with pants, maybe less so with a skirt, prefer something with more heel (Frye clogs, or Kork-Ease platforms) with a skirt."
1,Not Impressed,I have never really been fond of Ethics and Moral code to begin with because most of the articles fail to realize the whole point of what they are writing about. This book really wasn't any different. The articles about Abortion are weak and they don't fully explain what their whole point of what they are writing about is. It doesn't help matters when every article in this book is so drawn out. Everything that is said in this book could be done so in about 2 or 3 pages instead it is drawn out to about 10 to 15 pages. The authors are basically repeating themselves over and over throughout the entire article.I personally don't think this would be a great buy but maybe thats because I find all the arguments in moral and ethic philosophies are very weak and not at all to the point.
2,Recharged ink cartridges for Dell Printers,"Sorry to say I've tried 3 different brands of recharged cartridges from Amazon and none of them are close to performance of a new one from Dell. They cost approx half the price of a new one but don't last half as long. And the quality of the print is fuzzy and faint. Now if Amazon could find a way to offer a reduced price on new cartridges from Dell, that would be really neat. They seem to have the market locked up like the old fair trade marketing strategy. All the retailers have to sell at the same price."
4,Muy buen Cd religioso,"Personalmente me encantan los discos de Saylor and Flutz. Muy bueno, tanto vocal como musicalmente. La unica critica que tengo para este cd es que tomaron varias canciones al parecer hechas en ingles y la traducción al español parece literal. Pero me gusta mucho anyway. Cómprelo!!"
3,Good but not necessary,"I really like the concept of this feeding pad since I nursed. The only thing is that it is so bulky and to have to remember to pack it everywhere you go was a hassle. I found a blanket was just as good and much easier since you always carry blankets. I stopped nursing at 4 mo's, but perhaps it would have been more usefull when she got older if I still nursed, since then she would be more active. I have not used the bottle feeder attachment and I don't think I will use it either.I will say that it was very usefull when you had company at the house constantly and you wanted to nurse and stay with the group.erica"
3,Not worth the money,"I was looking for a nursing veil and had a hard time finding one. I purchased this and although the concept is creative, it is not necessary. I am happy with the veil, although it is somewhat cumbersome. I do not quite understand the need for the feeding pad portion of it. Are we really that busy that we need our hands free and cannot take a few moments to feed and bond with out infants? I am returning the product and getting a simpler veil. First years offers one for $6.99 on Babycenter.com and Baby Depot or Babies r Us offers one for $9.99 in stores, not yet on line."
5,I saw this on the Oprah Winfrey Show!!!!!,"I first saw this product on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Since then, I think I've seen it on her show 3-4 times. I was intrigued and starting purchasing the Gabriel Feeding Pad for friends and family as gifts. I've heard nothing but rave reviews from everyone and I continue to buy them as gifts. I recently purchased the Discovery Pad. It works with the Gabriel Feeding Pad and the moms really enjoyed that piece. Not sure if it is available on line but I bought in at a Babies R Us store. Oprah made a great selection on this one!"
4,Nursing veil,"I have to admit that when I first received this as a Christmas present, I tried it once, got flashed and put it away. My son's been squirmy from the beginning and couldn't stand anything covering his head. I'd almost given up on nursing in public. Later, I rediscovered it and read the directions. I'd missed the nice finger loops (there are 3 to choose from) Since then I've found I can tuck it under the elbow on the side he's nursing from and under my arm on the other side, use the finger loops, and it doesn't go anywhere. I find that he fights it less than a blanket possibly because he doesn't get so hot. The fabric is very light weight and I like the small slit I can use to look at him without exposing myself. I take it when ever I'm going out and will to have to nurse him. I've found that it rolls compactly and I secure it with a pony-tail holder. I'm glad I have it although I don't think I'll ever use the bottle option."
1,What a waste of money,"Wow, what a huge waste of money. A blanket works just as well, and so does not being so worried about what others think of you feeding your baby. It doesn't matter if your baby is nursing or bottle-fed - who stares at you when you're feeding a baby? NO ONE. It would just like going to a restaurant and having someone stare at you while you eat. The only people who notice nursing mothers are other nursing mothers or those who wished they could have.Don't waste your money on a big bulky item like this. Even if Oprah suggested it (and, if you don't know, Oprah never had kids!!!), don't buy it. She only suggests things that people pay her for."
1,interesting,"I am a little bit puzzled as if you have 2 free hands why would you put the babies bottle into a ""cloth holder""??What is the purpose of this item?"
4,Useful instrument,"Useful instrument in terms of the number of words and descriptions. It is very handy, but not very user friendly in terms of display. Youcannot change the size of the fonts and no guide for the users on howto efficiently use the search capability. If it didn't have these problems I would give it a five star evaluation."
3,Needs too much power and US batteries can not afford it,"Needs too much power and US batteries can not afford it, and ididn't use it,it stay in my drawer."
5,Very sturdy with easy access to media,"The flip tray is made from durable black plastic and it allows easy access to cds and dvds, the front and back supports are strong and won't break from the weight of the cases as you flip through them... One small warning... My clam-shell cases wouldn't fit neatly into the rack, they're just a little to small and one corner will always fall through the open bottom causing the tray to look unorganized..."
3,jack of all trades master of none,"Yes it may fit many types and varying amounts, but for my needs, DVD s and CD s, it is only fair fitting. They do not fit snugly. And my special VHS tape cases did not fit."
5,Obscure but excellent!,"If you are a synthpop fan of any stripe, this album absolutely belongs in your collection. Reminiscent of Depeche Mode without being derivative, each track has the rare quality of being danceable without degrading into mindlessness.You may know the band from their club smash, ""Once In A Lifetime"", but by all means, do not think of Wolfsheim as a one-hit wonder. Tracks like ""Heroin, she said"" and ""Hurting For the First Time"" will make you want to hear more, and the haunting, yet catchy ""Kunstliche Welten"" will make you wish you spoke German.This CD will be an excellent addition to your collection."
4,"Exceptional album, dark pop","This is a great album, pure and simple. As many have said before, the band sounds like a darker Depeche Mode. They combine dark moodiness with catchy pop refrains. Their melodies are less punctuated than DM which probably appeals to the goth crowd. However, Wolfsheim is more accessible than other Goth-associated bands.Most of the songs are in English, but you will still find yourself singing along with the German sings, too. Its a great all-aorund album for dancing, listening around the house, or driving in your car. Pick it up and give it a go. You'll love it."
3,Not industrial,"While this is not what i would consider industrial, much as many do not consider VNV Nation to be, it still is a very good cd. the sound captures you from the first song and never lets you go."
2,i hope no one considers this industrial!!!,"Very boring and uninspiring. sorry folks, just an opinion...."
4,Does just what it needs to,I've used enough lab notebooks to know that this is a good product. The copy page takes just enough pressure to where my pen marks come through but not my fingers holding the notebook. The pages tear out easily and the page layout is well organized and easier to use than any other standard lab notebook.
3,Good resource,Overall it is a good book for a science course. Very well designed however one must remember to seperate the carbon pages to avoide copying the writing to multiple pages.
2,Bad copy,"I'm a chemistry major and I use these notebooks quite a bit. I've always used the orange ""official laboratory research notebook"" but I wanted to try this brand out. The carbon copy sucks. I tried using a thin-point pen, I tried pressing harder against it when I write but the copy is still barely visible. After 7 pages plus the carbon copy I decided to go back to the orange notebook. It is way better."
3,Not exactly as advertised.,"The product review stated that it was ""spiral-bound"" and was why I chose this model. When I got it though, it was not spiral bound, instead it was bound on top with glue. Not what I thought but for price it will do."
3,A good book ruined by printing errors,"It is with displeasure that I review this book, since it is not possible to give it a fair or meaningful star rating. The book's original text might be worth five stars, but unfortunately a printing error has resulted in no less than sixteen pages that should have text on them being left blank (for those interested, the pages affected are 273, 276, 277, 280, 281, 284, 285, 288, 289, 292, 293, 296, 297, 300, 301, and 304).I could give this book one star for the printing botch-up, but that would seem like penalizing its author for mistakes no doubt outside his control. The three stars I've given this book are a compromise. Buyer beware."
5,An Era of German Philosophy,"Essential reading to better understand this period of philosphy and its impact Western culture, good and bad."
4,"Runs wonderful, looked great!",I wasn't keen on buying a refurbished router but I figured it was worth a shot. It came in looking great! Only minor scuffs showed that it had even been used at one time. It started right up and ran great on the test of it. I am very impressed with the unit.
4,EYE OPENER,TODAY WORLD NEED TO ENLIGHTEN KIDS AND ADULTS. THIS BOOK IS IT. I GAVE IT TO MY NEPHEW .ALSO I READ IT A LITTLE AND IT WAS WELL WRITTEN WITH EXMAPLES ALSO THINGS I DIDNT KNOW.
4,Growing Money: A Complete Investing Guide for Kids,"My son is 9 and has latched on to this book. He skips around to read different sections and really seems to be enjoying it. He is already saving to start his first bank account, so we will see where he can go from here. After glancing through it, this seems to be a well written and easy to understand book. Hopefully this will be a good influence on him!"
3,Not quite informative,"As always I read the book before giving it to someone else to read (in this case my little brother). Now I know stocks, so I can tell you what I think. This book doesn't tell kids what they should know, it tells kids what everyone ELSE knows...that's right...NOTHING. It tells you HOW to BUY stocks and HOW to SELL stocks, but it doesn't discuss how to INVEST in stocks. What are the right strategies? When should you buy/sell? Etc.So If you, your kid, or whoever you're giving this to, wants to be like everyone else and LOSE MONEY in the stock market, then buy this book. (Thats NOT a recommendation). But if you want to be a true investor and BEAT the market as did Ben Graham, Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch, and others, you might want to buy something a bit better. Unfortunately, i have yet to come across a good CHILDREN's investing book, but i HAVE come across a good TEEN one called ""The Motley Fool Investment guide for teens"""
3,ok. For beginners.,"When I purchsed this board i was very happy with it until I began to get into a full game. I learned that once the game gets around the half way point the small size of the board (13in x 13in) and the oddly shaped stones make it very difficult to continue. It becomes hard not to shift entire lines when trying to remove captured stones or even place pieces. However, the game is still fun and I do enjoy it. I just wish the stones were a bit smaller or the board a bit larger. For beginners this board would do just fine."
5,LETS GO GET SOME GO!!!!!!!,"first of all, amazing. they got me the board in one day and i only got standard shipping. but lets get one thing straight, this is strictly a BEGINNER'S BOARD. its not maple or anything its that plasticky imitation wood stuff. there arent go bowls they are bags that are not very durable. the stones are a tiny bit misshapen and are big so they are very hard to remove. its a medium board thats great for beginners. i would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn to play or has been playing for very little time, although i would go buy a cheap plastic go bowl no more than $20 because the bags are hard to tie and untie.Worldwise Imports Grey Plastic Go Bowls- Pair this is the link to the go bowl that i bought"
2,too thin,"In the picture it looks longer, wider and thicker than it really is. The valance is very thin and practically see through."
1,High failure rate like others say and company warranty is bad,"Like other people have said. High failure rate. This product has a six year warranty. What a joke. I have had mine for 3 to 4 years now. I have had 2 of 3 fail. The [...] website requires you to have the original receipt to get it looked at. Who after 3 or 4 years is likely to still have the receipt in their possession. I don't even think the product is 6 years old, so I don't know why they won't just send replacements to everyone who asks. Maybe that is why Home Depot no longer carries this product on their shelves anymore. I dare anyone from intermatic company customer support who really cares about the people who purchased their product and call them to apologize and replace the faulty products they sell. Email me at pyuned@yahoo.comIntermatic HA03C Home Settings Wireless Plug-In Indoor Lamp Module"
3,delay in turning on,"I have the complete system, these have a slight delay turning on. Sometimes I have to hold the controller down for 5=8 sec. and their only 10 feet away in the same room?"
2,I am time testing this product,I purchased this product because the first one burned out within a few months of buying the system. I will need to wait and see how long this one will last. The system came with 2 modules. the other is still working fine
2,Wireless Plug-In Indoor Lamp Module Review,I bought this item thinking it was going to be what it said on the package: Wireless. But it is not. It is simply a light dimmer and an on/off switch for any lamp you plug into it. Buyer beware.
1,Fails after some time (after warranty expires),"I have purchased 3 of this modules, by no means I use them heavily (use on my media room) and of the 3 only 1 continues working. When they work they are good, but after they fail its money down the drain."
1,"Poorly Manufactured, Poor Quality","While these devices are moderately priced comparied with other brands of lamp modules, be aware that many of these may arrive DOA or only function for a short period of time as with the ones that I purchased. I had no problem returning defective items as they backed by Amazons return policy. Just so you know, I looked for lamp modules on a lot of websites and one common thing I noticed is that many dealers had discontinued carrying these in stock. Wonder why? Get what you pay for even though these are produced by Intermatic, they are still cheaply made in China."
2,High failure rate - only 1 of 3 still working after 1 year of use,"Purchased three of these at the same time.Upon connecting and pairing all three with their associated light circuits, 2 of them worked right off and the other one made a big flash and loud noise and tripped a circuit breaker (all 3 were on different breakers). The one that blew was just connected to a regular 60w table light, too.Essentially one out of the three was DOA.Edit from Nov 2008 - a second unit also failed after about 8 months of use, though it was less dramatic. After 8 months of normal behavior it began only working at dimming levels of 50%-100%, then at 10 months it stopped working completely."
1,device burnt out in my livingroom after only 1 day,"I wasn't even using the lamp at the time. It made a loud crack, blew both 60 watt bulbs in the lamp and filled my living room with smoke.From reading all the reviews, these devices are very hazardous and should be pulled from the market until they fix the problems with them."
5,Bed-in-a-bag,Great price - sheets a little stiff to start with but after a few washes - very soft and comfortable.
2,A boring book on a topic I find thrilling.,"I haven't done a lot of reading in this area, but there MUST be better books out there on this topic. In 239 pages O'Hear told me all about how Kuhn and Popper and Feyerabend have it all wrong, and (of course) Anthony O'Hear knows exactly how we should be evaluating science from a philosophical perspective.I am not an expert on Kuhn or Popper or Feyerabend, but I know this--they write books that are a lot better than Anthony O'Hear's ""Introduction to the Philosophy of Science."""
3,On-Guard,"Well I had hoped this would have been a little better, but it is ok an covers the basics alright.I realize each teacher is different and see how my former instructor is far different than one teaching on DVD.For the basics, this is ok to get......"
2,Not a very good book...,"I didn't really like it. It wasn't the best book I've had. The pages were ripped, the front book is bended, was pretty cheaply made. Don't buy it!!!! Recommendation: People who buy a nicely made book. If you find my review unhelpful, comment on it."
1,"Useless, Completely. Do not waste your time.","To preface this review, I am not a real estate or even a finance expert. I dabble in personal finance and investing, and have been thinking of starting into real estate investing. I bought this book thinking it would be a good brain teaser to bring interesting real estate specific issues to the forefront for me.Unfortunately, what I found was a book full of useless references to the authors' previous materials and infomercials. The only thing more redundant than the questions listed were the mind-numbing answers from the authors. This book's only purpose appears to be to sell the authors' previous materials and investing programs. You can definitely skip this book.This book would have been of more use to me if the pages were blank. At least then I could use it as a notebook."
3,Bed in a Bag OK for price,"This product is OK for the price I paid, about $40. It would not be worth much more to me. The material is a little rough and hopefully will soften with washings."
4,Value For Money,"Brought 2 Set, for #30 they are value for Money. Only 1 complain, Material is hard, hopefully soften after a wash. Another thing, when you sleep on it, you feel its warm enough. So for summer not an ideal choice, hopefully in Winter it will give comfortEnjoy"
4,An Intriguing Project,"The format of the book is to record the conversation between three men regarding science, theology, spirituality, and human nature. I found the discussions of theology in particular to be interesting, as one of the discussants is a monk. The topics are covered in a non-dogmatic way, with a genuine questing spirituality evident. Without descending into New Age pap, the book explores fresh ways of approaching tradition in science and religion."
1,Religion; Not much Science,"I was disappointed. This book (which I ended up scanning through after a while) didn't provide me with any additional value. On a serious trek of digesting the work of Fritjof Capra, this book was clearly not a strong representation of his work (aside from the fact that it was the capture of dialog rather than a concentrated capture of ideas; typical of Capra's works). If uncovering the ""mind of Capra"" is your goal, stick with ""The Turning Point"" and ""The Web of Life""."
3,kirk versus the super alien.,This is one of the more forgettable novels of the Star Trek: The Original Series. It is predictable and rehashes an old storyline.Buy only after you have read all the other novels in the series.
3,Not bad,"This wasn't a bad novel, it had an interesting plot and it revealed some background information about the main characters, especially McCoy. The thing is - I didn't like Dr McCoy as Carter portrayed him. It was really hard for me to find any sympathy for him. I understand that his personality changed but the author could have still made him more likable. Acerbic is one thing, whiny something completely different."
2,"Good writing, poor characterization","Too predictable, and ""young"" McCoy was just painful. Worth reading for the style and attention to detail. It's an odd mix of good and bad."
4,Classic Trek at its best!,"This is one of the better classic Trek novels from a period where it was extremely hit or miss. What I liked most about the work and think that Carter worked out very well is McCoy's emotions at being a young man, trapped in an old body in his future. Definietly a must have if you are a collector of the series of books and a great read for the more casual buyer."
2,McCoy loses his memory.,"Well, McCoy loses his memory, and is back in the time where he is still in Georgia and going to med-school. Spock gets deathly ill, and McCoy can't do anything, and thinks everything around him is a big conspiricy. Well guess what happens at the end? If you don't know read the book."
4,A pretty slow book but well worth a read.,When an alien race cripples the enterprise starbase's which would take days at warp speeds are now years away. With McCoy with amnesia Kirk faces the enemy with a stranger at his side. An enemy with a unique ability which has targeted the enterprise and crew as their next prey. A good novel as you try to figure out who and what the aliens are and if Dr McCoy will ever remember his life as ships doctor and Jim kirks friend.
4,Great Campaign Analysis,"Sears (as usual) does a great job of covering all the logistics and numbers surrounding the lengthy Peninsula campaign, and it's necessary since the campaign's principal source, George Brinton McClellan, was deluding himself throughout 1862.Each battle is covered in very good detail and the maps are easy enough to follow. Sears does a good job covering every folly, from Johnston's mixeded up plan for Seven Pines to McClellan's disgraceful disappearance act on the Galena.As always, plenty of primary source information from the common soldier gives a good idea what the marches and other hardships were like. And every reader will put down the book completely disgusted with George McClellan."
2,Maybe I missed something...,"but I tend to disagree with the Kirkus reviewer. I find little ""mastery of historical narrative"" but instead relatively dense recitation of all too well-ploughed over ground. Dense, dry and derivative. I am reticent to have at the author's other works, despite titles of obvious appeal to those perusing the racks at an airport bookseller."
5,Wonderful Voice and Marvelous Songs,"I have enjoyed Lucho Gatica's voice since my youth. His voice is haunting and memorable. If you are a fan of love songs, you will like the selections in this CD."
3,Good Comprehensive book,"I ordered this book in hopes that it would contain an excerpt from Lady Mary Wroth's ""Urania."" Unfortunately it did not, and I couldnt find a copy of the ""17th Century Fiction."" This book does however provide an extensive array of 17th century women writers and a decent amount of biographical information as well."
3,Shady?,"Pants appear to be unbranded OTOMIX. I wouldn't mind that, but they come up in and OTOMIX search, and are being sold for the same high price as the OTOMIX products by the same seller. Probably same quality, but price out of line for something that does not have name behind it."
1,Totally Useless Psycho Babble!,As a therapist with 25 years couples counseling experience I found this book to be an utter waste of time. Psychobabble that could have been written by a high school student. Totally useless with regard to giving any real guidance or aid. One would do better to Dial A Therapist or get on line counseling. Save your time and money!
5,The eyes lead the body... Farnsworth's approach is unique.,"I have read a lot of golf instructional books and this is the most unique. Dr. Farnsworth's basic yet profound concept is that the what and how you see leads all else in putting. I found I am missing to the left because I see the hole to the left. Drills, tips, and sklill test in the book have helped me lower my score 3 strokes (I am now a 5 handicap)."
4,MRC1938,"The book is very technical and tedius, but the theory works very well. I think it verifies what I have been trying to do for years and have not been able to define. It accounts for being so hot with the putter one day and so not the next."
4,Great ant farm.,"I bought this ant farm for myself, even though I'm 27 years old. I've had not a single complaint in the past year that I've owned it. A couple of months ago, I captured a queen ant in my back yard and put her in the ant farm, and it wasn't long before she laid a few eggs. I'm currently waiting for the eggs to hatch, and for my ant colony to begin growing. I'm looking forward to collecting more ant farms to watch how the entire process works out, though I am a bit apprehensive about how to deal with dead ants as time goes on.I originally used the coupon in the box to order harvester ants, and the farm already has their tunnels in it for the queen and her brood to utilize in the first farm. Those ants arrived quickly and all alive, which is probably due to the fact that I had ordered them in the summer and the weather was perfect for them the entire way.In conclusion, this is a great product, and I certainly suggest it as a tool to teach children about ants and their 'societies'."
2,Not bad Not Good,This is an average book in a subject matter that does not have too many titles to choose from. His style of writing is rather conversational and the book is filled with stories that do not add much to the topic.
1,NOT a soundtrack - save your money if that's what you want....,"I don't know what this is, but it is not a MacGyver soundtrack. It appears to be some synthesized music, which has three tracks with the MacGyver theme and somebody saying the word 'MacGyver' a few times. I don't know where the other tracks are from, but I don't recognize them as anything from the MacGyver series. There is no information on the disc as to who the performer/performers are. (I guess nobody wanted the blame.) If I had looked more closely at the cover illustration, I would have realized something was wrong: MacGyver has a gun in his hand. Save your money and wait for a real soundtrack. If there was a '0' star rating, I would have chosen that."
1,This has nothing to do with the real MacGyver!,Look at the art work. The real MacGyver doesn't use guns. Spend your money on the DVD TV series.
3,not as it seems,"Thought poster was completely black, but it is outlined with thick white border. I like the poster, but am disappointed the seller did not show exactly how it really looks."
2,Ouch!,Ads say that this is not supposed to hurt but it does! Not as badly as waxing but still...... Does not get all the hair even after several sweeps. Leaves a sticky residue and is a pain to apply. I say skip it and have a professional wax you or stick to shaving. This is definitely not worth the money I paid!
1,scam,"I bought this item online the product seems to work but the software that came with it,My computer tells me that it is a pirate and sends me to a web site t download proper software. HERES THE CATCH, ITS NOT FREE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. I have already wasted enough money with ut adding insult to injuryAluratek ABD2020 - USB 2.0 Hi Speed Bluetooth EDR Adapter"
4,Women With a past,"I saw this movie many years ago liked it , I was surprised to see amazon had it i ordered it , its on vhs but thats ok quality,is good picture real clear i am glad i ordered it, it came when they said it would come"
5,Masterful,"It has been said that on the American frontier, one book could be found in the home of every family: the King James Bible. More than any other book, the King James Bible formed America's collective mind and cultural landscape. One cannot imagine, for example, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address without it. And now, this Bible has inspired Barry Moser's stunning illustrations. So--enjoy the illustrations, and read the text. (My only qualm: I wish that Moser had followed Gustave Dore in including the Apocrypha.)"
2,Gross and Distasteful,"I was hoping this bible would have pictures that could help me visualize what I read. Some of the pictures, like the ones in Revelation, do a good job.But there are several pictures in here that show nudity (including breasts) for no good reason other than to make a bold statement, I guess. Many of the pictures were offensive. There is one in particular where Mary is kissing the bloody feet of Jesus and the artist makes her look fat; and it looks like she's drinking his blood as it drips on her face! I was extremely disappointed with this buy, even though it was cheap."
2,"Rather dry, exceptionally violent though","Overall, while the old testament told a fanciful story of a jealous and vengeful deity, the gore and violence was a big turn off. I can't imagine why any healthy person would have faith in such a THING, but that's just my opinion. The new testament did contain some good lines but overall was far too mushy for my taste. I rated it with 2 stars, not for originality, but for a decent read with respect to a few books in the old testament."
1,The Worst Science Fiction I Ever Read,"A totally unbelievable pile of cow offal. Any plot holes are chalked up to ""infalliability"", and the storyline is full of random acts of ""righteous"" violence and encouragement of incest.Also, I thought the character of Moses was weak and unbelievable, and that Jesus's character in the book doesn't adequately convey the ""hippie"" look that he is given in Sunday School classes. They portray him as a Jew, for example."
2,The Holy Bible : King James Version.,"This book, in the true nature of all bibles is confusing and not worth the trouble of reading. Allthough a rather accurate version, i do not believe pictures or anything of the sort should be used in a book like this. Its in fact rather disgusting. Learn latin, it will be the most treasures language of any person who dares call themselves a christian in this modern day. This bible should only be read a a guide to the real thing, NOT as the word of god. And keep in mind, all of the wording is opinionated. English is not worth reading at all with the bible, the book may be handy to warm your hands in a fire, never to follow your gods word. With all respect -FaEx- Ave Satanas."
1,Myth rendered unreadable,"This is a very high quality book. Unfortunately, there is little worth reading and nothing relative or understandable between its handsome covers. It also misses as far as ancient myth and legends are concerned. The Judeo-Christian creation myth and the mandatory flood epoch are covered quickly, but then the stories dissolve into largely meaningless drivel. The second part, on the founder of the christian religion, can merely be considered as nonsense as far as historical facts are concerned. The stories comprising this work were compiled by the Catholic bishops at Nicaea in the fifth century. They picked what they ""liked"" of the available ""gospels"" and discarded the rest.To call this book the word of a god is ludicrous."
4,Pleasantly surprised,The part was double boxed and well packaged though the exterior box was slightly damaged. It bolted on without difficulty but I did have to file off a little bit of flash around a couple of the mounting holes and the mating surfaces to the head. The heat shield was a touch over sized compared to the original and required slight modification to provide good clearance around for the spark plug wire boots. The kit was complete and provided all the required new parts to replace the manifold including a gasket. Dimensionally it was an exact fit to replace my stock manifold. I thought there would be significantly more modifying to make it work but I was pleased at how little I had to do. I would buy this part again in the future.
5,Easily Deine Lakaien's best album to date...,"Though I do prefer a few tracks from Dark Star to any one track on this album, Kasmodiah maintains a high standard through the whole album, there isn't a single song on here that I don't dig.Darkwave, Goth it may be these things, but it is down right poppy in places. Somehow they manage to do this without loosing any of the impact or beauty that I've come to expect.Kasmodiah is for the masses as well as the fans."
2,"Book Ok, but contents missing in the CD-ROM","The book is OK. It contains a brief preface with some translation tips and then six translations of Japanese patents with translations notes.The problem is that the book says that the CD-ROM includes all the patents and their translation, as well as additional articles about translation techniques, lists of Japanese Technical dictionaries, etc. But all this is missing in the CD-ROM, which only contains a list of translations companies related with patents.I contacted Schreiber to protest, but no answer came whatsoever. I actually feel cheated."
5,Great Laptop Bag!,"Great case for a laptop. I have a 13.3 Macbook and it fits well. A little tight, but that's good so it doesn't slide around. Great deal!"
2,Doesn't fit a 13-inch Dell,"It's a well-made case, but doesn't fit my M1330 Dell, certainly not with a battery attached (either 6-cell or 9-cell).It is made for a rather fat (thick) laptop, not for the slim ones of today: it has very deep cavity to put the laptop in.Has virtually no room to carry charging brick, nor any room to carry other accessories like adapters, mouse, cables, etc.It DOES have a place to put your iPod or iTouch, and place for a small, slim camera.No outside pocket for travel documents, etc. Only the flap-covered pouch for your iPod and camera and calling cards and pens.Not very useful for air traveler. Maybe okay for carrying it to your local Starbucks."
5,Truly a Beautiful Story,"This story is truly amazing! For anyone interested in the UFO phenomenon, this is a must read, and should not be missed. My only regret is that I did not find this book earlier. There are a lot of UFO books out there about UFO sightings, crash retrievals, government coverups, and the fearful abduction phenomenon. Dorothy's story brings a balance to the negative alien publicity, by discussing her own personal experience with positive and spiritually evolved beings of light. She also brings great insight to the UFO phenomena as she has had prolonged communication with these beings over the last 30 years, and has been able to substantiate her story by filming most of her contact experience. According to the author, to date, there is no other contactee with as much film documentation of her contact experience as Droother Wilkinson-Izatt. The lack of publicity on her case is appalling, but her captivating story speaks for itself."
1,"I really wanted to like this movie, but...","I got this DVD to show it to my friends from Church around Halloween. I really wanted to like it because it is a Christian film and because it has Chuck Norris in it. But it was really bad. The acting was bad, the dialogue and story were silly and there was hardly any action. I decided that I would not put my Christian friends through this punishment and I never watched it with them. I will probably trade this movie for something else at a local movie trading store."
1,vomnit in movie form,"there is no way you can possibly give this movie more than one star. other norris flicks such as lone wolf mcquade are equally horrible as far as plot and acting go, but at least their action and comedic value make them a worthwhile watch. this was just garbage. stay true to your roots chuck norris- you are a texas ranger, not an angel sent to save earth from the apocalypse. i bought this movie to laugh at it, and it did the job. if you actually expect quality cinema look somewhere else. this is the worst movie ever."
1,What were they thinking,"This is by far the worst thing I have ever watched. Enough said, I wont even waste my time reviewing any further."
4,Like Very Much,"I like this CD very much, (though not as much as the ""Playboy After Dark"" CD that preceded it). There are two discs, one all instrumental, and one all vocals. All the songs are restful,romantic, suitable for dreaming. The performers are all first rate, and it's a bargain for all the music you get!"
2,"Excellent music, poor production",The music itself is excellent! But I question the quality of the recording. It is not clean and crisp. I would not buy this again as a present for someone else.
4,Paper on the thin side,"As the other reviewer noted, the paper is rather thin. Better write on one side only if you write with ink. Otherwise, great product and great price."
1,REALLY????,"Really??? Who would buy this paper at this price??? I was just curious to compare this cost to those from the stores during back to school season. Why would I pay $1 or more for only one pack of paper when I can literally get ten for around the same price during back to school season???? To make matters worse, the current Amazon price (as of 04/29/2011)is 4.99 for the one pack!!! Good paper but HORRIBLE price considering the alternative. My advice is stock up during back to school season...but even if you can't I can almost guarantee that the price in any store is at least half the Amazon price."
3,Okay.,"Yes it's reasonable but the paper was not very good quality. It was flimsy,yellowish and wrinkly. So not really worth buying if you like good quality paper."
2,Cheap,"Paper feels overly thin. In addition, the alignment of the 3-hole punch isn't consistent. The pages toward the front of the package are so close to the edge of the paper, most likely going to tear very easily."
4,"College Ruled Paper...nothing more, nothing less","There really isn't much to say about this paper...it's just your standard college ruled paper. I don't think there is anything about this paper better than any other paper I've used, but there is nothing to detract from it."
2,British Sign Language vs. American Sign Language,"My children and I love the illustrations and size of this big board book, but were disappointed upon receiving it and noting the signs were based on BSL (British Sign Lanugage) not ASL (American Sign Language). Although many signs were similar, there were also quite a few that were different. We're in close contact w/many deaf friends, so its not acceptable for us to learn BSL, when we're trying to learn ASL. I wish that I had known in advance regarding the translation."
4,This is a very cute and engaging book - for parents - and baby.,"The illustrations are adorable. Babies love to look at pictures of other babies - and even if you develop your own signs, this book will give you some guidelines."
2,Not as good as other books,"I have several other signing books and this is my least favorite.The illustrations don't do a good job of showing how to sign and demonstrating what the sign means.For example, if the sign is for ball then there should be a big picture of a ball."
3,I could have made these up myself,"There's nothing wrong with the book. It's a board book with baby signing images in it, just as described. I just wish I'd saved the money and made up the signs myself. As others have pointed out, if the goal is simply to make it easier to communicate with your baby, and not to teach your baby true ASL, then you could make up your own signs. The signs you make up are probably the exact ones shown in the book. ""Book"" is holding your hands open like a book. ""Car"" is to mime using a steering wheel. ""Sleep"" is to fold your hands next to your head as if sleeping. Why did I pay money for this, again?"
2,"OK, not great","this tuner is just average when it comes to electric tuners, it is very hard to get it to find the right chord that you are strumming, and the pitch pipe mode is a joke, it has the same speaker that a sound greeting card has, and you can't even tune your guitar to those high pitched tones. The only reason i didn't give it a one is because it works a little bit if you use the microphone to tune your guitar, and not plug it in to the tuner."
1,HORRIBLE JUNK,This item is the most terrible tuner i have come across its cheap and platicy and cant even tune your guitar correctly!! this thing was a waste of time and money don't even bother coming back to this page! i tried using it and it kept turning off beeping and ugh it was just atrocious!
4,Works great,"Bought this tuner for my wife's banjo. Works just great, only drawback is having it in a position to see it while you tune, but no big deal. Worth every penny."
3,Not Bad,"I purchased this tuner about 4 years ago. The external mic on the tuner is not the greatest, so this tuner works best for an electric/acoustic electric guitar where you can plug in, although in a pinch I have used it with the external mic successfully. Tuning has generally been quite accurate, but as it has gotten older it increasingly seems to be having trouble ""fixing"" on the pitch of the string, which can be frustrating. In addition, the batteries now seem to too easily become loose and no matter how many times I pry the contacts up to re-establish a tight fit, within a few weeks the batteries are loose again.Like many tuners when the batteries are weak, it can give some weird results.Particularly given the price, I can't complain about how long it lasted or how it has performed. All in all a good tuner for an very low price. For a little more money, this time around I will try the Korg GA-30 and see if it performs any better."
1,Worthless,This thing don't work at all. Waste of money. Jumps all over the place.You get what you paid for I guess.
2,Bad!,"Its terribly inconsistent. I've had it a couple years and it suddenly stopped working properly. I tried changing the batteries which was a temporary fix, but within a day or two it stopped working again. Now I have to buy another tuner."
1,Bad !!!,"this tuner is just bad, goes out alot and also does not know what chord you are hitting half the time."
1,Terrible Tuner,"This tuner is very inconsistent. I followed the instructions exactly, had it so quiet in the house you could hear a pin drop. Tuned the first 3 strings to what it said was perfect, went back to the first just to confirm, and the tuner said those strings were completely out of tune again. Does NOT work."
5,GoRhino,"Excellent quality and price and fast delivery once again from Amazon. GoRhino is the way to go if you want a unique quality product that will do the job for you. I thoroughly review and research a product and price before I buy, but find I keep coming back to Amazon to getr done."
4,Not as I had hoped,Maybe if you have a minor foot problem this patch will work. I had toe surgery and a titanium rod implanted. I was hoping it would take some of the pressure off the area below that toe but finding a firm but cushy shoe ended up being my answer.
3,External Aluminium Case Enclosure,"I received exactly what bought, but when I received it I try with a 2.5 Hard Disk and I couldn't introduce it inside the enclosure."
3,Why would an unmarried couple try to get pregnant?,"Lyssa desperately wants a baby, and after too many fertility treatments, her boyfriend Jake says enough. Thinking he just needs a cooling off period, little does she know he's moved in with another woman. Faced with uncertainty, she does what any woman would do - she goes on a trek to Nepal. And then meets the real man of her dreams.This one had me scratching my head. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would - I just could not get over the fact that a woman who did not have a commitment with a guy would go to such lengths for a baby... call me conservative!"
4,Great Book,"This was a great book. It's about a woman who learns a lot about herself-things she never would have known she was capable of. She also learns that what she thinks she wants and needs, may not be true. It's also about stepping outside of your box and doing something adventurous. It makes me want to go to Nepal and try this adventure myself. Read and enjoy it. It's also quite funny."
5,Carole Matthews does it again! Yeah!,Carole Matthews continues to write awesome chick lit. This is a great story ... lots of interesting things going on with several different characters. The chapters are short and it is a quick read. This was my first experience with Red Dress Ink but not my first experience reading Carole Matthews. It was a nice intro to Red Dress Ink and a nice to re-acquaint myself to Carole Matthews' great stories and easy flowing writing style. Recommended for chick lit lovers.
3,Colored labels are great for moving,"I have moved for work or school a lot. 26 times and counting. And I have always been the one to pack and organize the boxes.Labels like these are essential to good organization. They are better than the sheets of labels because you can carry them easier around the pile of boxes and they stay neater in the plastic case.I prefer the neon colors because you can see them easier from a distance or in a low light environment - moving van, storage unit, closet.However I was disappointed that these labels did not stay on the boxes too long. After two weeks some of them are falling off. I also bought ""Avery Self-Adhesive Removable Labels, 3 x 4 Inches, White"" which are still attached to the same box. Perhaps because the white labels have a larger surface area."
5,I wanted this,"This is just what I wanted, and now I feel safe to have it available in case of an emengency"
1,expired,"very disappionted, there are 2 boxes of the cereal are all expired, totally waste my money, and non return able"
3,"Easier online, no deal on price","I purchased this product online because I couldn't find it in the stores at that time (2 days later it was in the store also). It's good that comes quick, save a trip to the store, however, no deal on the price; same as Walmart, Kroger, etc."
3,50c per box more expensive than stores,"I purchased this product online because I couldn't find it in the stores at that time (2 days later it was in the store also). It's good that comes quick, save a trip to the store, however, the price is so much higher than Walmart, Kroger, etc (50c per box more expensive, total 7$ more expensive than the stores)"
3,Geber Barley Cereal,the only reason I purchased this on amazon is because I could not find it in the stores and the pediatrician had recommended it for my infant grandson. It does not disolve well and tends to clump up in the nipple.
3,A sweet love story with a fabulous hero,"This is an enjoyable story with a kind-hearted hero but the plot hinges on a deception cooked up by the heroine. Bron, the heroine, spends the majority of the story pretending to be her self-centered sister Brooke in order to make a little girl happy. During the course of the story Bron falls in love with the little girl's daddy but is reluctant to spill the beans about her identity fearing that she'll lose the hero forever. This is the major source of conflict between the two and really dragged on too long for my tastes. Still, it was a sweet story and the wonderful hero makes it a book worth reading."
5,Fabulous!,Everything by Ms. Fielding is wonderful! Give yourself a smile by enjoying her warm characters and fast-paced writing; this author knows how to hook the reader and keep her!
2,they serve their purpose,"I purchased these about a year and a half ago and the handles on every cup have broken off. They have always been hand washed and air dried, and used maybe twice a month. The only good thing is that the markings have not worn off and that area is still attached to the cup."
1,not SL,"My B-12 was very low and my MD said that I should take B-12 SL, cause its fast acting. I am a nurse also. This SL is Hard as a rock, you have to chew it really hard. It should melt under your tongue."
4,great early compilation,Despite the photo of a mature Hoyt Axton these songs all date from the early to mid 60s. Back then he was a young high energy folk singer and several of these songs feature Hoyt alone with his guitar. Some great songs like 500 Miles(a hit for Peter Paul and Mary) and Greenback Dollar(Kingston Trio) and almost all the songs here were written by Hoyt. Its a fascinating trip back to the formative days of a great American singer-songwriter.
1,Poor Quality,"This Bed in a Bag, is made of such poor quality materials. The sheets are very rough and itchy, even after washing and drying them four or five times, they still feel very rough. The comforter is the same way. But what do expect for $30.00 right? I guess I got what I paid for."
1,Picture very deceiving!,Very poor quality. Looks prettier in the picture. Really regret buying this.
2,pretty but itchy,"if you have sensitive skin, stay away. this is a stiff (but pretty) fabric. the colors are very nice (not too dark for me) but it is not 100% cotton."
1,sick set !,too dark.....reversible fitted and flat sheet look funny....very stiff....kinda slippery...sham is open on BOTH sides(is that how it shd be?I have washed it...or else wud hv returned it.
1,"I Agree, Colors Are Way Too Dark","I was also disappointed in the colors being too dark. I also agree that is really stiff, not the least bit inviting. I am getting ready to return it."
2,Disappointed Colors are MUCH darker and different than pictured,"Shortly after I ordered I began seeing posts that the color of this set was NOT as pictured. Not Pinkish and cream. I was going to cancel and re-order something else. But when I went in to do that it shipped earlier than expected. It is much darker brick reddish colors and dark tan, and green. BIG floral print comforter with stripes on one side All BIG reddish floral print on the other side. The bed shirt is striped green and tan, the fitted sheet back ground is tan, with small reddish, and blue flowers, the top sheet (flat is 1/2 comforterpattern and 1/2 fitted sheet pattern) 1 pair pillow cases small set are tan and goldish tan, the other pair is a lot bigger and are the large reddish floral pattern like comforter. The whole set is real stiff. I bought it as a filler for $29.99 buy $125 get $20 cpn. Had I seen it in person I would NEVER bought it."
5,adorable,It's sturdy and has a clear design. I love it. I bought it as a Christmas present and am very pleased with it.
5,Ideal for punctuation lessons,Punctuation takes a holiday is an ideal foundation for lessons dealing with the importance of punctuation when students are proofreading their writing. Primary school-aged children are sure to get a kick from the combination of pictures and humorous text. Older students might appreciate a different way of refreshing their knowledge of the topic.
2,nap time,"Most of Scarlatti's 555 keyboard sonatas are fast and inventive, with scarcely a dud among them. The ones played here, however, are from a soft spot in the manuscripts in which Scarlatti pads the good stuff with a series of atypical suites. They are awful! Yes, I'm reviewing Scarlatti here, but although I have never before heard this particular combo of chitarra and mandolin, I have to give this performance a thumbs-down. There are many great performances on guitar out there, but I can't recommend this version."
2,Too heavy,"The ex-foliating side is not as rough as the leyijie towels, which is a plus because the leyijie usable but a bit like sandpaper. But it's much heavier than the leyijie as well because of it is highly absorbent.I tend to use the cloth (folded into a 4x4 square), so after trying it out for a week, I had cut it but it was still heavy and it became awkward to grip and use.I just bought and tried the Cure Japanese bath cloth and it was exactly what I had been looking for. It's not too rough and not too heavy while using.[...]"
5,finally,"I love, love , love this towel, I will buy a dozen. Lathers very well, really good scrub yet gentle. Does the job!!!!!"
2,Maybe i'm just missing the point,"It seems like it could be great. I mean, it's really rough, so it should exfoliate and remove the dead skin (or whatever it's supposed to do).Honestly, i can use my bare hands and rub vigorously on my skin, and i can get dirt or dead skin to come off in the shower. I figured this towel would get the same job done with less effort. It doesn't.That said, it scratches the heck out of my skin, so i suppose if that's what you're into, grab two of these like i did."
5,The Coolest Techno CD Ever!,"If you don't like german techno, don't buy this record. But if you do, buy it now! It's just so cool! Hardpumping beats and deep,deep bass. Every techno-freak has to buy it!"
5,Awesome Movie,I watched this on TV & just knew I had to own this DVD. It's portrayal of events from those with lower ranks is riveting. A must watch for anyone with an interest in the Titanic.
5,GREAT RECREATION OF THE BRAVE MEN IN THOSE BOILER ROOMS.......,"I also watched this PBS program and I have to say it brought me to tears, just seeing those brave Irsihmen working in the bowels of the ship, keeping the lights on for the passengers to board the lifeboats. Without their bravery and sacrifice, they would have been more casualties. This is truly a sad story and not one known by all who have an interest in the disaster. The acting is first rate and it will brings it home, when you see the actual photos of those brave souls at the end of the program. I cannot wait to purchase the dvd."
3,Just OK,Seems a little thin for a checkbook cover. Not really what I was expecting for the price paid. Might not hold up.
4,A well-crafted young adult novel...,"This well-paced read narrates the immediate predicament of a drug-involved young man and his circle of friends. The reader begins to understand him and his distorted thinking as the tension builds and his problems increase. Nyman artfully manages to win the reader's sympathy for Corey while, at the same time, illuminating his misjudgment. The complex, disturbing world that can influence our kids is depicted for those adults who have not experienced this first hand. The chapters are short and suitable for many reading levels, thanks to the thoughtfully selected vocabulary and great dialogue. The book has a lot to offer the curious or worried parent, as well as any young person--involved with drugs or observing from a distance. There is much to be learned here, and the book can be instructive or simply appreciated as a well-written young adult novel. There should be more work published like this to be shared between young people and adults! Well done!"
4,Research & resource,I used this book as a source for my research on rodeoing and bullriding for my debut novel. It served my purpose very well.
4,reasonable board for a good price,"Picked this board up with a Athlon 64 X2 4600 processor. Was upgrading a friend's system and once I did a repair install forcing the multiprocessor HAL at setup the process was relatively painless. Bluescreen came initially before I realized that I needed to replace the HAL on the repair install (if you don't and do mange to install your Device Manager will show two processors with a dual core chip but it will not use both (checked with CPU-Z). 939 is on its last legs, but this is a cheap price and a relatively inexpensive way to get into dual core. The audion front panel header setup is a bit confusing, so gave it 4 stars. Satisfied with this board."
1,Amazon and tiger direct tricked me,"I bought this motherboard for one reason cause it had great specs.Shipping it to Barbados, very costly,and installed it, time.ready the start it, it keeps getting a cmos error cause the f***ing bios is bad and the as#holes still sent it even though the makers said had the bios was bad and had a x on the biosI wold like a refund are a similar mother board with the same specsOn the makers site people had the same problem with the bios, and guess where the got their mboards from."
3,"Attractive, tippy","It's real marble, but the ""gold"" connectors are cheap-looking up close. Also, it's quite tippy if your floor is not perfectly level (sticking it near a wall in an old house will be problematic) or on carpet with any degree of pile."
3,Confusing,"The plot was a little confusing at times. It jumped from one area to the next and left you hanging. Actually, I'm still hanging trying to figure out what happened. Entertainment doesn't have to be so complex. I look forward to the next novel to simply figure out the first. I hope the author sheds the light."
1,This author should personally give me a refund,"I was so excited when i heard that this book was coming out that i rushed tho book store to get it. I was sad to discover that the only interresting part of this book was the first page, then the story line just went downhill from there. Maybe my hopes were to high for this book. I have been searching for a book series to rival Anita Blake and this most definitely is not is. the only thing that i can say is I want a refund."
2,Disappointing,"I love a good urban fantasy, but... The book started out good enough and with enough humor that I felt compelled to finish it, but it keeps jumping between worlds with no explanation and quickly becomes so confusing that it's hard to follow. Then, it becomes so unrealistic that you don't care if you don't follow it. (a 26 y.o. who has realized she is a shaman yesterday is defeating Cernunnos? Really? And he is infuriated but he keeps politely answering her questions? Right then.) Before it's over, it has lost what little humor it started with and you just want to get through the last 30 pages so you can move on to something else. If you love Butcher and Andrews... don't pick this up."
4,Sokay,"I liked it but I remeber thinking ""this is very complicated."" I like a challenge but it kinda took away from the book a little - still having a hard time attatching to the characters because of all the fantasy fluvia. Not that it isn't great but maybe the book should have been longer. I haven't read more than twice yet and not yet purchased the sequel which usually I can't hardly wait to get to the next book. Overall good but needs more something to compete with Mercy Thompson."
3,Meh... It was fine,"I think she's stumbled upon a pretty great premise, but it's disappointing that she didn't do more with it. The world building was mediocre at best, and some of the shamanistic ""trips"" were sort of confusing and poorly tied in with the rest of the story. I'm glad I didn't pay more than $2.99 for it."
5,this book is awesome,i thoroughly enjoyed it. i can't wait to see joanne grow as a character in a world she gets plopped into
1,To much romance,What could have made this a 4 or 5-star listening experience for you?If it was more of a urban ministry and less of a romance novel.What could C.E. Murphy have done to make this a more enjoyable book for you?C.E. Murphy wrote a romance book and that is what it is. I wouldn't think C.E. Murphy would want to change anything. It fit the book that C.E. Murphy was trying for.What aspect of Christine Carroll's performance would you have changed?Nothing
3,Humor redeems a confusing fantasy tale,"The humor of this novel redeemed itself; as a fantasy it was a little over the top and confusing to me, but I found myself laughing out loud constantly so that made up for it."
4,"Urban Shaman (The Walker Papers, Book 1)","This series was alright. I think that it was a little to much and overboard sometimes. I did like the concept, but was a little to much to take. I have read all three of the books, and again it was alright."
3,"Good, not great","I enjoyed the character and seeing another take on the Wild Hunt myth. I thought the prose flowed well and it did keep me interested. BUT....the last half of the book got a bit jumbled and formulaic.Worse, it could have been set anywhere. The only Seattle references were things that could have been lifted from a guidebook. There was no sense of local flavor, the streets, the air, the light...which I thought the author could have researched easily enough, given that she lives in Alaska and flights are frequent. Also, there were some factual problems, as in the snow that fell. Seattle certainly does have snow, but it's unusual, and the characters should have made more of that fact. So, a good enough effort, but not wonderful."
3,Started but never finished.,"I started this book but never finished. It was promising, but hits a slow patch in the middle and once I put it down, I never felt the need to pick it back up. There are so many other books that are more exciting or more fun to read, I'd rather spend my time with those."
3,"Good story, but unpolished","I really liked the story ideas and the overall plot of the book. CE Murphy is an engaging writer with many many good ideas. Her writing is a little unpolished, nothing a good editor shouldn't be able to help with and the flow of the story is a little too fast. There isn't enough character development and some of Ms. Murphy's facts are a touch, well, wrong, however with some better editing and a little more time spent on developing the storytelling Ms. Murphy could be a great writer. Her main character is engaging, funny and likable. The story is believable in the context of the paranormal fantasy genre, but there isn't enough details or characterization. Good debut though, and please continue to grow as a writer Ms. Murphy because I think with a little time you could become a great author."
1,very disappointing,"I bought this book based on the many good reviews. This is the first book I've tried written by CE Murphy, and I am not sure I want to try any more. It is incredibly tedious. A good example would be how the protagonist keeps complaining about how her contact lenses make her eyes tear. This happened a gazillion times in just about 50 pages into the story. Who cares? It's so repetitive and pointless. Adds nothing to the story. And the protagonist seems to have a God complex. She keeps talking about how she is going to ""save the world."" Oh please! Give me a break! This is teenager stuff. Worse. There are so many other better books out there."
4,Not what I thought but........,"I enjoyed this book and will continue to read this series and look for other books by CE Murphy. I picked up this book expecting a paranormal romance. It is not. Really not.Urban Shaman is the story of a woman who has burried her natural gifts and her rediscovery of them.I do NOT like books written in first person but found the story so engaging I couldn't put it down. Murphy creates a world of fully developed characters and has a wonderful writting style. The main characher, Joanne Walker, is funny and strong without ever being over-the-top. I read every single printed word. This is very rare for me and the hightest compliment I can give a writer.Bottom Line : A solid story that can be enjoyed across genre lines. Take a chance, you'll like it."
3,good first but needs work,"This book is good for a first book, but i had to push myself to read it.I would probably not buy another just get a library copy. It had too many stalls and did not flow.. Too many improbables....."
4,Great debut,"For being a debut novel, this was very well written. The story was relatively original, the writing was well-done, the plot flowed well, and the undercurrent of tension throughout was nice.It's definately not the best book I've read this year, but it's a good one! Not terribly memorable, but I have a feeling that, with another book or two under her belt, Murphy will be an amazing author! Even currently, she's far better than the majority of writers out these days."
3,Good writing- disappointing story,"I enjoyed C.E Murphy's writing and found her heroine's background interesting. Unfortunately, I kept getting knocked out of the story by glaring inconsistencies. Murphy either needs to make the an AU where people are a lot more exposed to paranormal events or make the reaction to Joann's actions a lot stronger."
1,"Good start, but got dull quickly","I give this book one star because I couldn't finish reading it. I enjoy books with people learning new powers and discovering new things about themselves, so I enjoyed this book initially. The book was very fast paced in the first 100 or so pages. I loved hearing about the Celtic and Indian traditions and I cared about the mystery that was being set up. However, once the story is neatly in place, and the details on the mystery are given, the book turns into a slow crawl through overemphasis on small details and boring events. I didn't like the main character and couldn't get over her complaining about why things had to happen to her. I found some of the details unbelievable, especially her boss and friends believing so easily in the occult. To sum it up, it started great, but got very boring, and I just became uninterested. I would call this book a mystery with a little bit of the paranormal in it, not a paranormal book or even an urban fantasy."
3,Urban Shaman enjoyable read,"Really 3.5 stars. This book was a little confusing at the beginning and took a while to get into but the heroine is likable and unique. Secondary characters add to the action. I especially liked her ""Senior"" taxi cab driver who sticks with the action and adds his two bits. Her encounters with her boss with their antagonistic attraction are enjoyable. You sense that they learn to respect each other's differences. Lots of potential in this series and I look forward to the next one."
4,"Lively Humor, wry sarcasm - great fantasy","Great fantasy is more than magic or the unexpected - great fantasy fleshes out the characters and makes you care about them.Urban Shaman does that.The humor and self deprecation of the heroine makes her real to the reader, and creates a page turner of a good read.Good mystery, good magick, and characters to care about! All I want to know is WHEN are the next books in this series coming out?"
1,Did Tedrow bother to read any Oz books?,"In Mr. Tedrow's introduction to this book, he claims that he was read the Oz books as a child. It has been a long time, apparently, because this ""sequel"" bears little resemblance to the magical realm of L. Frank Baum. This is a trite, overworked rendition of the screenplay for ""The Wizard of Oz."" One would be much better off reading the original series."
4,Creative Advice,"This book is intruguing, and raises a number of helpful, and creative, propositions. As one example, in gin, you never know what cards the other people have, although we make educated guesses about them. The author explains that this is the same for others when they view our abilities, desires, and needs. The author makes the point that the only cards which you can ever fully perceive are your own, and we must recognize this when others misperceive us. The whole book takes simple truths from gin rummy and applies them to our lives. I didn't always agree with all of them, but most of them were very insightful and right on target.The book is pretty short, which is its downside. I would have liked another hundred pages. But it is still well worth the money."
4,Enjoy this bag,"Ordered this bag to be used to take to school. The external material is very strong. After a couple of weeks, there was a small tear in the seam at the bottom of the pocket on the backside of the bag. I don't really use that pocket so not a problem for me. I am doing some backpacking and using this as my bug out bag. It really does the job. Great buy!"
4,a little surprised,"the actual product looks nothing like the picture, I saw other users complaining about this with other rothco bags so they better fix it. Otherwise the only thing that i like about the bag is its plentiful pockets:)"
2,Tiptoeing Around a Teen in Training,"I thought this book was a waste of my reading time. I saw a review on the Today Show, and read several postive reviews as well, and it piqued my interest. What I thought may be a book about how to deal with and accept the coming changes/challenges of a mother/pre-teen daughter relationship was a book about a mother seeming to tiptoe around her daughter's emotional state. What is Sarah going to think about this, what is she going to say about that, etc.? The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that I applaud the time spent Karen and Sarah spent together. Something that should be done in all parent-child relationships.I would like to think there are better books on this subject."
5,A MUST read for every Mom of an adolescent girl,I loved this book!!!! Couldn't put it down. It took me back to when I raised my daughter (now 26) and I chuckled through it all--calling her to recall that time in our lives and how are relationship continues to grow each and every day. Stabiner weaves a great story that rings so true. Amazing what a strong foundation does to a mother-daughter relationship. The author and her daughter Sarah have just begun the adventure and the best is yet to come. I speak as a mom who has been there and done that and look back at the early time with great joy. I would not trade it for a minute! Don't miss this read and share it with your friends!!
2,Potentially Confusing,"I also thought I was purchasing Nautica by Nautica Cologne Spray. Same as the reviewer above, I recieved Nautica Classic Eau de Toilette, a completely different product, and a less expensive product than the Colonge. In an attempt to correct this, Amazon said they would ship me a replacement. But guess what....I received another Nautica Classic Eau de Toilette. If you want the Cologne, be very careful."
3,Misidentified Punctuality,"I was looking to purchase Nautica by Nautica as shown and described on the site. What I recieved was Nautica Classic by Nautica, a completely different product. The item I wanted comes in a white box and a tinted bottle, than the Classic which comes in a silver box and clear bottle. The item shipped and delivered quickly, the price was fair, but the product was not as described therefore not what I wanted. Please make sure to double check item descriptions and actual items, it's a headache to get the wrong anything but especially a scent that's unreturnable."
5,It's an very useful book for an Ashtangga learner.,"It's a very good book for an Ashtangga Yoga learner. But as my experience,If you are a beginner, you'd better have a teacher first, as Ashtangga Yoga isone ofthe highest level in Yoga world. Most the strength and the stretchare all need to reach the extreme.So though the book can help you learn and remember the movements, but areal good teacher is the most important!"
4,Namaste,"I received a different version of the book than was advertised, but it's basically the same thing with a different cover so no big deal. Everything else was great."
5,very helpful reference book,"I have found this book very useful as a reference. I am currently taking an Ashtanga yoga class. I can't imagine using the book without the knowledge/experience I get from class. However, it has been very useful as a reference book at home. For example, the other day I wanted to know where exactly my hand should be in a particular pose...I was quickly able to find the pose and hand position. A book is no substitute for a class with a qualified instructor but this is very helpful for home practice."
5,a MUST for the Astanga practitioner,"David Swenson's book is the definitive Ashtanga practice manual; complete with incredible pictures of the asanas, including modifications for newbies. A MUST have for any serious student of Ashtanga yoga."
4,A Yoga Book I Can Understand,"This is a great book to see how all the poses of the primary series work together, and it gives some great tips to improve my practice. The pages on mastering the ""jump through"" have been really helpful to me. I also like how it details the secondary series-gives me something to look forward to!"
4,Excellent,"As a recent Astanga devotee, I really needed a book that would clearly demonstrate each asana plus appropriate modifications. Swensen's book accomplishes this task admirablly and provides invaluable hints and 'subtle points'. It really is designed with the yogi or yogini in mind, Thanks David!"
5,Great introduction!,"This book is awesome - it gives you everything you need to begin or expand on a yoga practice. Plenty of positioning instructions with a focus on the most important benefits of yoga beyond the physical. Helps combine positioning, breath, bandhas and flow. Enjoy! Namaste."
4,"You say Ashtanga, I say Astanga","This book is a classic and David Swenson is well loved by the yoga community. I'll admit that I find the design of the book and the quality of the black and white photos a little too rough and homespun for my tastes. (David did the design and layout himself). But, you can look at the excerpted pages and decide for yourself if production values are of import. Overall, I find David's voice friendly, supportive and unassuming. He does provides alternatives and modifications of poses for lesser able students. This book covers a lot of information, including Primary Series and Intermediate Series.Between owning this book and ""Astanga"" by Jean Hall (0754810747) which has lots of luscious color photos featuring a variety of models, especially Jean Hall, I have access to a balanced presentation of Astanga."
3,Maybe later...,"First the positive -- a good review of basic yoga principles, good pictures, and the coil binding. I bought the book for a) the good reviews, and b) frankly, the coil binding.The not-so-positive has more to do with me than the book -- if you're a rank beginner like myself, get this book once you're comfortable with the basic poses and have begun to put together a home practice. I had only taken a couple of drop-in Ashtanga classes before I bought this book. I reviewed it from cover to cover when I got it over a month ago, and haven't cracked it since because I was so intimidated. I've since signed up for a beginner class, where I can get some direct feedback and learn alternate poses (to be fair, Swenson does offer alternatives), and also to get a better sense of the flow of yoga and absorb some of the gestalt. You can't get that from a book. I'll probably return to this book once I figure out what I'm doing, and what place yoga has in my life."
2,"Oh, it's a PRACTICE manual",This book would be wonderful for someone who has been practicing yoga for 10 plus years. Definitely not for the beginner. It's like trying to read a foreign language even though there are definitions in the early chapters. I'm going to try to send it back.
3,Not for Beginners,"This particular yoga manual is best for those who are already very flexible, with some yoga knowledge. The book's spiral-bound format is extremely user-friendly, and it's filled to the brim with clear, helpful photographs and various one-page ""full-flow"" to ""short-form"" synopsis of various routines. I'm sadly no contortionist, but the kind of athletic person who is stiff and terribly inflexible. Currently, I'm severely laid-up with another ankle injury after two surgeries, in a support-boot for months. I desperately need basic yoga to regain and maintain muscle-strength, and become more limber, and will have to look elsewhere than this book. Author David Swenson is so advanced and limber that many these positions are far beyond the horizon for a stiff beginner."
5,Excellent practice manual,This book is an excellent practice manual. It details the asanas of the primary series and intermediate series. Using this book to practice at home when unable to go to the studio it is very valuable. Alternative positions and using blocks are also explained. Highly recommend.
5,The next best thing to a David Swenson workshop!,"I have taken one of David's Ashtanga workshops and left awestruck -- he so wonderfully explains not just the ""how"" of doing each asana, but the ""why"" and the spirit of practice linking them. So, I had high expectations for his book, and it did not disappoint. The explanations and illustrations are clear and comprehensive, and it perfectly captures his charismatic, down-to-earth, very approachable teaching style. I consider it my textbook reference for the Ashtanga series of Sri Patabhi Jois. It's the next best thing to actually attending one of David Swenson's workshops."
5,not for beginners!,"this is a classic yoga manual that i've used for years, but beginners must be aware that it does not ""teach"" you how to do yoga. only an experienced yoga instructor can do that! if you've been practicing yoga with a teacher and would like to work on - i.e. PRACTICE - the primary series at home, this book is for you. the illustrations are wonderful, the descriptions helpful and accurate, and as others have mentioned the binding stays flat when opened, so it's very easy to use while practicing."
4,some typos,This is a very practical yoga book but there are a couple of typos.I feel like if you pay over $20 for a book it should have no errors.
5,"A ""MUST"" read.....","This was one of the best books I've ever read. Mr. Spence simple and straightforward style gets right to the heart of the matter. This should be required reading for all who TRULY value freedom, honesty, self-acceptance and happiness. I could go on and on, but honestly, I don't think my review could give it justice. PLEASE BUY THE BOOK !!!!!"
3,Not to bad,"This book has positive messages for teen's hearts, but this book isn't as interesting, as fulfilling, or as entertaining as other books similar to this that are on the market. Instead I would recomend the Chicken Soup books made for teens, The Teen Ink series, or Taste Berries for Teens. These are the books that I think are of better quality. There is more to read in these books as well. But this is only one teen's opinion. :D"
5,EMOCIONES is hard to beat!,"GRAMMY NOMINATED!! And with songs like ""Que Tal te va Sin Mi?"",""Los Amantes"" and ""Para Volver A Volver"", just to name a few,it's a real mystery why this isn't a Grammy Winner! This is out-of-print, if you can find it, I urge you to get it. You won't regret it. It truly belongs in ever Carr fans music library."
3,Better ways to prepare,"Although this book will probably help get you ""ready"" for the test (70-229), you will need several other resources to gain a true understanding of the concepts set forth. The excercises are far too general, but the essay type reviews at the end of each chapter are extremely helpful.I would suggest Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming and SQL Server 2000 Developer's Guide as companions."
1,A MS Press Book With 10 Mistakes About A MS Product,"Ten mistakes can be found in the book some small and some large like how many stores and storage groups can be found in a 2000 Exchange Server product. Instead of twenty as a total the number given is 96, now thats not just a typo.Wordy at 1000 pages and skips around way too much.Read the reference book instead, you will learn more.Really a poor job, especially for MS Press."
2,Did not prepare me well for the exam.,"This book is supposed to prepare you for the 70-229 exam. It fails on almost every level, the questions at the end of each chapter are nothing like test questions. You'd be infinately better prepared if you read the sql server books online. Not only are they free, but they include the information you'll need to pass the exam.If you want this book as resource to learn SQL Server 2000 i'd tell you to look elsewhere. SAMS 'Microsoft SQL Server 2000 unleashed' title is far more comprehensive.In summary, i'd avoid this book like the plague. I had to read it because my training school required me to and I regret the wasted time. My time would have been much better spent reading through the books online."
2,Great for Ref. - Awful for Exam,"Well laid out (seems to be printed directly from ISA's Help system), and does an excellent job of explaining ISA's vast configuration, features and positioning. Will also make a great reference guide. However, if you plan on taking the 70-227 exam, and you don't have real world firewall/proxy experience, don't rely on this book to get you over the 70-227 hump.This book simply does not provide enough practical scenarios or examples anywhere near the complexity of the exam. Also, testing software or questions besides the 5 or 6 at the end of each chapter is absent.Bottom line, if you already have this book for the exam, complete it, then get another book for exam practice. Otherwise steer clear of this MSP title and use ISA's Help for reference.Later"
4,Useful overview,"`Designing Microsoft Windows 2000 Network Security' brings together all the sections on security held across four books of the Resource Kit. Much of the material is similar; however it is all good stuff. If you are interested in designing a security structure to cover your LAN, WAN, portables and the internet, then this book explains how to set up the VPN, IAS/ RRAS servers and all the transport, authentication and encryption protocols involved. The sections on integrating the various types of certificates into your Windows 2000 system make it a worthwhile buy in itself."
2,Only for new hands,"If you want to take exam 70-229, this book is not for you. Most topics are just simple concepts and cannot make you well prepared for real tests. There are some typos in exercises, which make you waste lots of time to find the way out."
2,Review of MS Press Designing Directory Services Infrastructu,"I found this book to be very very sketchy in technical detail, concentrating more on the business analysis side of things. There were lots of references to fictitious companies which was quite helpful in demonstrating concepts etc, however, after having read this book and numerous Technet articles, I'm inclined to say, if your buying this book as a reference for your own AD design, save yourself the money and read the Technet articles related to AD design if your focused on the Technical side of things such as where to locate GC's and DC's etc. Very few facts and figures presented in terms of, for eg, how many DC's would be needed at one site to support x number of workstations."
2,Don't buy if you are new to SQL Server 2000,"I find this book particularly hard to follow. It contains much theories and little useful examples.The book is dry and poorly explained. To benefit from this book, you need to have worked with SQL Server or somewhat familiar with the tools and terms.If you are new to SQL Server 2000, save your money and look for something better."
2,Not enough,"Good reference book, and covers subject matter decent, but still leaves a lot of details that you are tested on out. This is one of the harder Microsoft exams, so study hard for this one. I would definately use another resource if I had it to do over again."
2,Too many mistakes,This book is well laid out and split into nice manageable sections but there are just too many mistakes. Not just typos but mistakes in the examples which just isn't good enough and severely off putting when preparing for an exam.
3,Not so bad,"This book contains enough information in the following areas:stored procedures, triggers, XML, entities and indexes.It also contains poor information in the following areas:Managing and manipulation data.Cursors.SQL Server tuning.I strongly recommend the Microsoft self-paced book. It contains more material for the exam."
1,Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server Implementation and Administra,"Good thing Microsoft Corporation and Kay Unkroth teamed together to write this utterly useless and purposely 'vague' book on exchange. What would normally be one sentence facts are instead replaced with long-winded paragraphs that insinuate features that will leave you longing for a straight answer (Does it or doesn't it do that?). This book reaches a new low in the abysmal Microsoft Press line of books, which acts to prove that Microsoft really doesn't want to teach you how any technology works especially their own."
2,Horrible book if you want to learn Exchange 2000,I bought this book to get me up to speed with Exchange 2000 and it is a horrible buy. The author jumps all over the map with concepts and ideas. He does not define concepts or definitions clearly (or at all) and does not build upon them very well. Buy the Administrator's Companion by Microsoft Press. It is a better purchase if you want to use it as a learning guide for your MCSE.
3,Great to start with but not Complete,"This book is great for beginners. The topics covered in the exam are dealt very nicely. The book gives a head start to any person who has had little or no experience in SQL Server. For the experienced programmer as well, this booh has something. There is a case study which goes along with the chapters of the book and so you get a hand on feel of a live project.But as I said this book gives you a head start. For complete understanding of the topic, u need to refer to book like Inside SQL Server 2000. Even Books Online is also sufficient. The topic structure in the same matches with the structure of the exam.So I would say if you are starting to work on SQL Server or haven't been exposed to all the topics that are part of the exam, this book is nice. But later you have to refer to Book Online for detailed understanding."
4,A bit of overkill but still a good book to have around.,"Working on the transition to Exchange 2000 is a project that I am involved with. I am using the Resource Kit for a lot of planning and deployment ideas. I think that with book as a compliment to this book I will be able to pass the exam.I found that there are over 80 labs in the book and coupled with the 120 day evaluation of the software this make it easier to process the concepts. What I found was that unlike some of the other Microsoft Press books, this one does not seems to flow as well from topic to topic.Also being new to the Exchange 2000 Arena, I also thought this book may have been written to those with a little more experience. Although I did like the deployment, public folders and especially the Outlook Web Access section, since they apply more to what I am working on.Overall I think this book can be a handy and useful tool if it was scaled down to every technical level."
3,This book alone won't help you to pass 70-219,"This book taught me how to draw a site, a domain, a domain tree, and a forest. There aren't any new technical material about Active Directory on this book.I passed this 70-219 because I took it about 2 weeks after I took the 70-217. I was still fresh with the Active Directory stuff. And I studied the Transcender in that 2 week to be familiar with the exam format.The key to this exam is to figure out how many forests and how many domains to use."
2,Not a test prep book,"This would be a good book for a junior DBA, or a mid-level programmer looking to come up to speed on database functionality, but it simply does not have the depth or breadth needed of a cert prep book. It does a good job of introducing concepts and giving basic excercises, but as soon as it starts getting into the meat of a topic, it stops and goes to another topic. I was looking for a book which would bring me back to speed on SQL Server (I used it through v6.0, then switched to Oracle), but it has almost none of the detail I needed."
2,Nelson does jazz,Not what I expected of Willie Nelson. Might be ok for him to try jazz but to far out for me!
3,Willie Nelson does not enhance the memory of Ray's music,"Wynton Marsalis, Norah Jones and the rest of the band are great. The jazz riffs are great. If you are expecting anything resembling the Ray Charles sound or a brilliant interpretation from Willie Nelson, don't bother. His renditions are discordant and left me flat. I had to play a couple of Ray Charles albums just to cleanse my palate."
3,Can't touch their jazz collaboration at Lincoln Center,"I love these two guys, but this performance can't touch their ""Live from Jazz at Lincoln Center"" performance. Tough for even Willie to out interpret Ray Charles."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a big Willie Nelson fan but this DVD didn't do much for me. Willie just didn't seem comfortable and no one on stage seemed to be having any fun. Wynton Marsalis does his best to try and put on a good performance but he couldn't carry it by himself. Norah Jones has that wonderful voice, of course, but she was young in this video and looks very uncomfortable. These are all great performers but unfortunately this one just didn't fly in my opinion."
5,Back in print -- under new title!,"This is a fun book, third in the Liaden Universxe series -- read the other reviews for details -- but the first three are now in one book called Partners In Necessity from Meisha Merlin-- and a bargain it is!"
4,Reasonably intelligent romantic space opera,"This is the third volume in a story arc that began with _Conflict of Honors,_ and it picks up right where _Agent of Change_ left off, with Val Con yos'Phelium and Miri Robertson apparently marooned by circumstances on an interdicted (pre-spaceflight) world. Much of the book is taken up with the pair learning about and adapting to the local culture. As a Scout, Val Con is used to this, but Miri is essentially uneducated and has to flounder a bit before she learns about her own talents. Their use of music to fit themselves in is a nice theme. But there's also the search for their missing kinsman being carried on by the Korvals -- which draws the notice of the Department of Interior, which you don't want to do. Again, the romantic element gets a bit out of control, but not too badly. And you want to have the next volume ready to hand when you finish this one!"
4,I loved the book. it was a great 2nd book is there another?,very good book. keeps your interest and links from the 1st book very well. the characters were well developed and the story line was good. There was the main story line and a sub story line as well. the book kept them current w/ each other and linked them well and in a way that followed well with the story. i loved the interplay of Val con and Meri. the book showed their human side as well as there expertise in their own fields.
2,"Enjoyable, but not deep","The books in this series are intriguing principally in terms of plot. Action, rather than detail drives the events. Character development is decent, but descriptive elements to embellish both plot and character are lacking.For example, in the introduction of the turtle-like race, there is little physical description available beyond that they are large, long-lived, and generally turtle-like. This may be an intentional facet of the authors' writing styles, however, it is to be noted in the descriptions of places and people as well.Apart from visual elements, sounds are not fully described either--guns go ""boom"" ...The novels are quite appropriate as far as reading level goes for younger audiences, but the content is such that an older teen audience is recommended. Sexual situations are not described in detail, but a post-modern ambivalence toward sexual issues is prevalent."
4,A very good read.,"It's hard to say what made me like this as much as I did. While the suspense is good, it's the crisp writing and the very intriguing characters that really drew me in and kept me going. I'd not read Klavan before, but I can guarantee I'll be reading him again"
1,Unreadable by the layman,"This book is far too dense to be read by anyone (like me) without a thorough background of recent Chinese history and politics. Even though I am comfortable with pinyin, no way could I keep straight the constant barrage of names zipping by. No explanation is ever given for various Chinese political terms, many of which were not familiar to me. And there is no historical narrative present to unite the material and keep it interesting.If you are just an average joe/joan like me who wants to know more about China, don't waste your 28 bucks on this book."
1,Poor Quality Poor Customer Service,"Gave ring to daughter for 13th birthday. A Sapphire fell out within two hours of wearing the ring. Called that afternoon 9/17 and was told to ship item priorty mail, insured(shipped 9/18) and a new ring would be mailed immediately upon receipt. Three phone calls later, I have received nothing but a run-around. Today, 10/10 told they never received my package, disputed that based on prior phone calls and insured confirmation, and then finally told that the package has been misplaced and they would have to reprocess a new order. Demanded a full refund and got an arguement. Szul is suppose to send an email confirmation confirming cancellation. I'll hold my breath and going to dispute the charges with my credit card company."
1,lame....,"Just weak! Who told this man he could sing or write a reggae song?Another guy from foreign ""trying"" to do reggae... no thanks, I'll stick with the authentic thing"
2,Poor customer service,"I consider the ad misleading, it shows TWO umbrella stands, but the order only came with one, and no where did it actually say ONE, it just says ""KIT"". So I accept that...I should have called to clarify the number. My bad.Furthermore, the ad said the order would include TWO 65 watt bulbs for the light, and only one came with the shipment, with no reference a back-order or such.Amazon offered to refund my order, or give me a 10% refund, but what I wanted was the bulb that was supposed to come with my order. Amazon said they had no control over items shipped by other companies, they were just the 'broker' here.I called Discount Tommy, the vendor, and left a message, and never heard back.The light works fine, but in fact I found a better made equivalent in a local photography store here in Phoenix for a few bucks less, even considering the sales tax.So, I'd suggest you not buy this kit!"
3,Nice product.,"Let me start off with the product is very nice. Now for the bad part. The picture may throw some off because it is shown as 2 lighting umbrellas and it only includes 1 stand and 1 umbrella. Also it states that you get 2 ""bonus"" light bulbs, which I did not receive. It is a bit misleading and if I didn't need the item right away, I may have chosen a different product just based on principle alone. However, I do like the stand itself and it should serve it's purpose so I won't be returning this time."
5,Huzzah for James Nelson!,"James Nelson has hit his stride in this, the second book in his (to date) trilogy. Nelson's prose drives the reader like smoke and oakum through the opening months of the war, tapping well known heroes and lesser known knaves as characters in this marvelously constructed adventure while never losing track of his main characters, Isaac Biddlecomb, Rumstick, and the beautiful Virginia Stanton. It's fantastic to have, finally, a cast of Americans to cheer for. I sincerely hope Nelson deigns to stick around and turn the trilogy into a many volume series I can sail with for years to come."
3,save it for the chatrooms!,"has everyone been writing reviews and making friends or something on this review thingie? hummm that's got something to do with sweet dreamz siernna! yeah save your friendships for the chatroom and email, and write a proper review of the dolls.this doll is okay, she has pretty hair and stuff. her outfits are bright and sparkly which show the personality the makers are trying to imply ""cute innocent teen havin fun with her friends!"""
5,this is the best doll!!!!!,I have this doll.She is sooo cool!!! I callher sherri not sierrina. Everyonei know who likes bratz loves her!
1,well i dont hate sara...,"guys, not everyone hates sara. theres only those people, kandra and ruby tuesday, but they hate everyone, so it doesnt matter."
2,Not like real checkbook cover,Not much of a description listed but was expecting it to be like most other checkbook covers with a few slots for credit cards etc but there are none Very disappointed. Also didn't expect Amazon to charge me 1/3 of the purchase price to return so I guess I will keep. Do like the leather and emblem.
3,"Nice shoes, Okay on comfort, Run on the small side...","I like these but they seem to run a little small. I should have gotten a half size bigger. They don't have enough cushion/arch support as I would like either. Seems a little hard when running. I would rather use these as walking, exercise machine type shoes. The color and quality seems pretty durable though. Overall, they were a little expensive for what you get."
4,Prankster's Delight,"This book details the intricate and extensive practical joke played in the late 1800's on a New York priest by the mysterious ""Gentleman Joe."" The writer clearly revels in the intelligence and creativity of the prank, and his style is well matched to the subject. My only complaint is that some of the background history gets a bit too involved, distracting from the main story. This is a good book for anyone plotting a creative joke or revenge...I'd not try it at home, but it's good for inspiration."
3,Watch out for errors!,"My initial perusal of this book picked up the following rather blatant mistakes:Back Cover: ""Wearing a cap made from raccoon skin . . ."" (In real life, Daniel Boone never wore a coonskin cap.)Page 13: The homestead is comprised of 250 acres, not 25.Page 17: Fort Necessity is NOT located ""at the site where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers merge to form the Ohio."" That's where Fort Duquesne, later Fort Pitt, stood. Fort Necessity is 50 miles to the southeast.Page 19: The caption identifies Boone's rifle as ""Lick-Ticker."" Try ""Tick Licker.""Page 47: Two, not three, of Boone's children were killed."
2,Daniel Boone,"One of many books about Boone. This one lacks the substance of many others. The best is that by Lyman Draper. Second is that by Nathan Boone. The book by John Bakeless is a very good earlier study, and covers all the ground well. I suggest this book for younger people, but scholars will want to look elsewhere."
2,"Good Idea, Uneven Execution","The neat premise of two friends building a catapult caught my attention, unfortunately the actual book wasn't as successful. The whole idea of two middle-aged, San Francisco area men getting grant money to build a working catapult sounds interesting, no? As it turns out, not really. The actual construction is poorly explained, I would have liked diagrams showing each piece, as it stands, I never really completely understood what he was talking about. There is a fair amount of boring detailing of the two friends coping with normal life and high and low points in their friendship. In order to add some bulk to the book, the author has added chapters here and there about technology and war. It is these which prove the most enlightening and interesting to read--however, I am sure there are texts better suited to covering the relationship between technology and war."
5,"A smart, superblly written story","Catapult is perhaps my favorite book - and I'm a nonfiction writer, who reads. The ironic voice, the pitch-perfect sense of humor, the grabby topic - but best of all, Paul interweaves a beautifully and concisely told story, about boys being boys, with a fascinating episodes-with-catapults history and with a surprising and wary meditation on the joys but also the questionable consequences of boys being boys. It's terrific."
4,the fine art of obsession,"This is not a book about mediaeval weaponry, it is a book about a man who becomes obsessed with an illogical pursuit - building a catapult. The man knows nothing about such endeavors, like myself when I first read it, and being historically accurate was not his goal. He just wants to shoot a projectile with as much force as he can. As Mr. Paul became engrossed in his quest, I became engrossed in his book - and his obsession. I lost this book in the Ft. Collins flood several years ago and have been obsessively trying to find another copy. Thanks, Amazon.com."
1,Pure Pledgerism and 100 % Disappointment,"As the ultimate dog lover of 3 dogs ( one being a foxhound) and avid reader, I can honestly say that this book lacked information specific to the American Fox Hound. Although the authors / breeders are to be commended for their well researched chapter on "" Hunting and history of the fox hound"", the entire rest of the book appears to be pure pledgerism on basic dog / puppy facts gathered from another book . Embedded in the narrative discourse of the entire book are wonderful pictures of fox hounds, but the content is plain and repetitive information that can be found in any puppy or dog basic training book . I was disappointed because this is the only book listed by Amazon on Fox Hounds . Too bad there was no content information on temperment or obedience, or statistics rating aspects of this breed. My opinion is to save your money and search online for information on the American Foxhound by surfing the net."
2,Only if you have to read it,"The older I get, the more impatient I get reading boring books. One of the amusing qualities of this book was that the binding was put on backwards. Ok, so there's a slight manufacturing issue there.The book, itself, is pretty much a textbook and if I didn't have to read it for class, I would've found something far more interesting to read. Basically, it goes through the theories of trust and how trust exists in society. I don't necessarily agree with the theories, but I'm not the expert writing it.All I can say is that it's pretty much a sociology book and great for insomnia."
3,A Few Laugh-Out-Loud Moments,"I read ""Born to Kvetch"" by the same author right before reading this book, and I think it helped. I'm not Jewish by heritage or upbringing, so a lot of the writing in ""Shlepping the Exile"" seemed like inside jokes that I didn't ""get"". However, there were a few passages sprinkled throughout the book that would be funny to most anyone.Overall, I recommend ""Shlepping the Exile"" to people who are interested in Jewish culture, grew up around Orthodox/Hassidic Jewish people, or are speakers/students of the Yiddish language."
1,Shlepping the exile,"This book has a lot of funny anecdotes, but the inclusion of 4-letter words, i.e. profanity, detracts from it. I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Interesting,"This is the kind of music that really gets in your head and makes you go ""Ahhhhh...."" wasn't that sweet. it's pretty good, and you don't get sick of it that often. I'd recommend it to any non-germans speaking people who wish to explore their music"
3,Very Dated,"I bought this video for our interns to help them with what can be a very difficult task of fitting new doors in old openings. The material on doors is good, especially if you're interested in creating your own jambs. However, I must say the the information on windows was short and very dated. I don't believe any mention was made of proper flashing techniques, or really any information with how to detail the exterior opening. This is a major omission considering improper flashing techniques can cause very expensive and obtrusive damage in a home quite easily. Therefore, I cannot recommend this video to anyone looking for in-depth knowledge of window installation."
2,Disappointing,I was very disappointed in this DVD. It is only 60 minutes long with half the time about doors and the other half about windows. I was interested in learning how to install doors. There is just not enough time being devoted to either subject. The publisher for some reason is afraid to go beyond this 30 minute mark. The instructions given are very brief and incomplete. God forbid you spend an extra minute or two on something. Watching this DVD you would think that a door could be installed in 3 minutes!Mr Law might be a good carpenter but unfortunately you would not know that by watching this DVD. This ismy first and last time that I purchase a DVD from thispublisher.
4,Good video,"I like all this DIY stuff. The world needs more of it. This was a good video, easy to follow."
2,Unexpected price,"At first sight the item looks cheap, but it's nothing but a plastic test tube that you have to fill with water. You have to ship it back and pay an additional price to get the lab results. The product description says that the price is $15 dollars to get the ""standard"" lab results, but on the product envelope (barely visible on the image) it's explained that you actually have to pay at least $30 dollars if you want the ""standard"" results. By ""standard"" they mean that it will take 7 days to get the results after the lab receives the water sample. If you want the analysis done more quickly (2 days) you'll have to pay $45. So for the ""standard"" results you will have to pay a total of about $38.That said, 10 days after shipping the sample, I'm still waiting for the results..."
3,Okay,"I'm re-writing this review because after getting through by phone, I got the company to re-send the test results and I am now satisfied. The results didn't identify the detection limit which is irritating - but when I called again they said it was 1 ppb."
1,Avoid Tracfone,"May rating would be 0 stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that option.While it's convenient to have a pay-as-you-go phone plan, the service and equipment provided by Tracfone is abysmal!I have had three Motorola phones that have not even lasted a year. Customer Service - no such thing. The solution for most issues is to sell you equipment. Most representatives speak, but do not understand English.FYI - Net10 is the same company."
1,Beware! Still not working after 1 year.,"Beware Tracfone. I regret that Amazon won't let me give them 0 stars. We got this phone for my wife's aunt last December. After 1 year of trying to get this working, she still cannot receive calls. She can call out, but no one can call her. Tracfone support is useless (and generally only marginally speaks English). You also cannot manage the phone or minutes on line. You have to call in and give them about 60 digits that the phone shows you to do almost anything. We're letting this one die with over 400 units left on it because it is basically useless. Coverage isn't good either, but who cares if you can't receive calls anyway? There has got to be a better option, because I doubt there are many worse ones."
1,Pick another TracFone reciever,"This review is for the phone unit itself - Not the TracFone service.Folks, stay away from this phone. I liked it a lot for the first 60 days, then it 'died' and lost my call information, my minutes and everything else. TracFone says that they are having big problems with the C139. They're sending me another one, but that doesn't make me comfortable. What happens when it dies?Meanwhile, I'm without a phone for over a week now.Save yourself some headaches. Pick another phone."
2,Buy a Nokia phone - They have free incoming text messages,"This phone may look cool, but I'd recommend the Nokia 1100 or one of the other Nokia phones instead. Sure, the Motorola C139 looks cool, but you'll be charged 0.3 units per outgoing & INCOMING text message. You're only charged for outgoing messages with the Nokia Tracfones. The Tracfone user guide says that all incoming messages are free. I called their technical support and they told me that this is incorrect. They confirmed that incoming messages are chargeable for this handset and some other Motorola's. That's probably why the price was reduced to $18.88 in Walmart. I already have a Nokia 1100 and can confirm that I've never been billed for incoming messages. I got the C139 to replace my 1100 since I've had it a while and it's starting to look a bit scruffy. I used the Tracfone ""refer a friend"" to get 140 minutes free (worth approx. $50). Once I've used this credit, I'm going to throw my C139 away and get another Nokia Tracfone."
1,Paint chipped immediately,"I was very disappointed with this toy. Paint chipped off the first time my daughter put it in her mouth, which is inevitable. I bought it in a store and it did not have a choking hazard/small parts warning. I wish I knew that before, but not sure what the small parts are or what 3+ year old would want to play with it. You're better off trying a clacker toy from another company -- Haba for instance."
3,Good within limits,"I find this tuner to be accurate for middle ranges, however, I play flute and piccolo. It will not pick up the piccolo even in the lowest range and certainly not the flute in higher registers. This might be perfect for a lower range instrument. It is certainly small and quick and seems to be accurate, when it does pick up."
1,Don't Bother!,If you're looking to fish in the Northeast...forget it. This book seems to focus in on two or three states for the most part. I was very disappointed with this directory. I expected more from Bass Pro Shop. Two thumbs down...save your time and money.
1,You get what you pay for...or less,"I wanted to get the most out of my recent investment in the MetaStock software so I went book shopping. I purchased this book because I assumed it was one of the great O'Reilly Nutshell series books; it is not. You can get more information at the MetaStock web site then you will ever get out of this book. The book mentions only a fraction of the options available in MetaStock and describes nothing in detail. It is like reading a very very high level outline. There is nothing of educational value to be gained by purchasing this book unless it is: ""You get what you pay for"" and in this case even less"
1,One star is too many,I bought this book thinking it would give me additional information and examples on writing with the metastock language and many other features of Metastock.Forget it.!!!This is nothing but a simplified version of a how to get started manual.I wish Amazon had a negative scale.I wasted my money and effort.
1,Metastock in a Nutshell,This book is totally out of date and applies to a distant past version of Metastock. It should be updated of taken off the shelf.
4,Using Metastock,This is an excellent book to get you started using Metastock.Gives a basic introduction to the major components and from there you can find your own way.
4,Lock N' Load...SHOOT TO THRILL!,"I want this guys job as a tv host for badass shows like this!! Where the hell do I sign up? Anyway, the Gunny provides some good education on some big guns and the history of said guns most non-infantry (or non-military if youve never served) people wouldnt know about. Awesome show."
2,this dvd is letterboxed 4x3,This dvd is not 16x9 like it was on tv. its 4x3 letterboxed.I have to zoom in on my tv to get full the screen.This needs to be on blu-ray.but this is a very good show.
2,The wrong songs are listed,"I purchased this CD for 2 songs, Woo Hoo and I'm Blue. It turns out Woo Hoo is not on this CD."
2,Not worth it.,"I have been a serious shaving mug guy for over a decade. In my long search for the best shaving soap, I tried this product and did not like it. The soap smells funny and is no better than a basic drug store brand shaving soap. I threw it out after only a few days. So, funny smell and average shave equals two stars at the most. I would recommend Burt's Bee shaving soap as the best I've found but it has been discontinued. Good luck finding something else."
5,"The Famous ""MR GLO""","I use this as a face prep/cleanser for wetshaving. This is a glycerin soap, and the scent has a nice, fresh smell. Make a thin lather with a brush or face lather with the soap, and do a quick water splash to rinse it off before starting to lather with your favorite cream or shaving soap."
4,Great Product,It's work well and I think it improved my shave. I will compare it to the whole foods glycerine soap for a ower price and see if it's worth it.
4,The Second Shift,The Second Shift got her really quickly and I did not have to wait too long. The book was just like new.
2,Not my kind of reading,"Had to have it but did not enjoy reading it. To me, it was boring and not worth the time to read."
1,"Polemics, not scholarship.","To reach her spurious conclusions, the author presents decades-old data on men and housework as if these studies came out last week. Credible research from the University of Michigan shows that men and women work about the same amount of time when you include both work done inside and outside the home. Ladies, if you want to read a great book that will help you earn more money, read ""Why men earn more"" by Warren Farrell. Studies show that the claims of feminism are questionable at best, and at worst misleading and damaging to women and all who earnestly seek the truth. ""The second shift"" is part of the backlash against equality that has been gradually building up steam in western culture since the Renaissance."
5,Best Review of Maternal-Infant Nursing yet !,"As a nursing instructor I've reviewed many books of this nature over the years. This is the first I've found that covers each and every topic and sub-topic adequately and even goes above and beyond that with the explanations. It prompts the reader to remember what had previously been learned and bring it to the forefront of the brain. Easy, concise, thoughtful, and complete in it's coverage of topics. I would say this is excellently written and thought out."
2,piece of junk,This is a cheaply made piece of junk. The decal came off the front and the particle board is falling apart. I paid more for shipping than the original cost. Save your money. It's not worth it at any price.
3,pesky neighbors,"I had pesky neighbors and read a feng shui book that suggested using one of these mirrors to deflect their bad behaviour. Their trash can would spill into my yard, they would not clean it up very well, they would flick cigarette butts into my yard, when they had bbqs they would throw the corn cobs over the fence, their dog would bark anytime I went into my back yard. They moved and things are much more peaceful and the new neighbors are much better."
5,Love this!,"I need to buy a couple more... its reallynice item, colorful.. you may have to re-gluethe mirror on the plaque part, but that's a no brain er.Looks lovely in my kitchen!"
1,this is cheaply made out of particle board,"this is cheaply made out of particle board. i searched amazon with ""solid wood bagua mirror"" and this came up. they have a 6 inch version also which is just as bad. dont buy it!!!!!"
1,review album,"What a disappointment to receive a CD with 5 pieces on it, with only 2 of them complete! The other 3 are clips.... short clips at that. Definitely not worth purchasing. This is a demo album. Purchase another album of Jon's that is complete."
1,Disaster,"I just heard the title track. Very cliche, cloying pop song directed straight at 14 y/o girls."
5,Great Stuff,"I first came across MLTR in the philippines and was quite impressed by their atmospheric pop sound. The music flows well, and creates a beautiful aura. Great Pop music"
3,silver atomizer,"The silver atomizer seems to work well, but was a bit scratched up when I received it as though it wasn't new to me. I thought it was supposed to be a brand new product."
1,Leaks!,"I'll be honest - I only bought this because my favorite perfume doesn't have a conventional cap and could not use it with my Travalo. I thought this would be a good alternative because I could spray it directly into the glass bottle and take it with me. The first day I got this I loved it. It was so easy to use and it seemed to be secure. However, after a couple of days it started to leak in my purse. At first I wasn't sure if it was because I hadn't screwed it on tight enough, but when I went to unscrew it I noticed it was definitely tightened as much as it could go. I have no idea how this leaked, since it seemed to be secure, but it did and I wasn't happy to see that my expensive perfume was totally wasted. At least two good things came out of this: (1) Luckily I didn't fill it up completely in the first place specifically for the purpose of having leaky atomizers in the past (lesson learned) and (2) at least my handbag smells good! :/"
4,Atomizer in my purse,"This atomizer is a great deal,it looks chic while delivering a perfect spray. It is easy to fill,and delivers just the right amount of scent in one spray."
3,There is something better,"There are several things I didn't like about this. The bottle inside is not secure, it leaked, it is glass, and it is difficult to transfer my pretty expensive perfume from its bottle to this one.I found another bottle on Amazon called Travelo that is perfect and I love everything about it. It did not waste one drop of my perfume while transferring. It is perfect for traveling and it is cute."
2,leaks,leaks even with light use with it sitting on the table. Simple to fill just by spraying the perfume into it.
5,Great,This came in so handy. I have so many smallbottles of perfune that are in a plain (splash)bottle. This not only allows me to use up thatperfume it always makes it easy to carry with me.
5,Great Space Savers,These are top-notch dvd cases that store nicely four dvds to a case. These are great for storing copies of any digital media.
1,NOT THE BEST 4-DISC DVD BOX!,I recently purchased this item and was very disappointed. Mainly because of the way the case was designed - 2 discs on each side (on the same hub!) they should include a picture of the inside of this case to let the buyer know what he or she is getting.
1,There are better books out there,"This Small Business Marketing Guide did not impress me at all. I wish I had not purchased it. I have purchased other books from Entrepreneur magazine, and expected much better suggestions and ideas."
5,Excellent book for any level user,"This was a required read for a small business marketing course. A very well written, easy read. Lots of info for the price."
4,Great source of marketing ideas for any organization!,"I originally checked out a copy of this book from my local library. However after reading it cover to cover, I wanted to purchase my own copy. The author comes up with some really good and practical marketing ideas. I used some of the ideas in the book to come up with a couple of marketing pieces for the local non-profit organization that I am currently volunteering with. The book does a good job of telling the reader what to do, but it falls a little short in telling how to do it. Overall, it is a good book to have in my business library."
4,Plenty of Good Ideas,"This book is not a cover-to-cover book about marketing theory, but rather a large series of examples that cover many marketing categories and topics. While I can't say I use a lot of these ideas everyday, many are good and for me, the best benefit is reading a wide variety of ideas in general. Marketing is more creativity than science in my opinion (once you identify a real market with some measure of certainty), so reading such a varied collection gets my mind thinking in new directions. That alone made the book worth it for my money. YMMV."
4,A well written book,"When I first started reading this book, I was a bit overwhelmed. Especially while reading the first few pages of chapter 2. Being new to exchange server and never using the product before, and after reading the first few pages of the second chapter, I thought I made a mistake in buying this book.But as I read more of the chapters, I grew to appreciate the writing style of Mr. Boswell. He explains the most tedious exchange topics in an easily understood manner. He takes you step by step and explains everything in great detail.If you're looking for a book to pass the MCSE tests, then look further. This book really is geared to truly understanding the product. This book won't give you years of experience in administering an exchange server but it's a great resource for ""newbie's"" such as me."
4,Bazaar and beautiful,I really enjoyed this one. Only it was burned from an old VHS copy. The picture and sound are pretty horrible. The animation is extremely rare and unique. The story is fun. I wish someone would remaster this. It is a gem.
4,Buy it now!,"One of the most interesting group in Italy, often understimated due to their lyrics (very enjoyable anyway); the musicians are great and the arrangement works very well and it's full of ideas. This is what I call creativity!"
5,Awsome product for light use!,"My recorder gets light use. I use it for making grocery lists, to-do lists or when Im out and want to remember something interesting when I get home -- just basically anything I want to remember. I say its light use because I dont record long meetings or anything like that but it did go off in my pocketbook one time without me knowing(you can program it so that doesnt happen accidentally but I never bothered)and it actually recorded my whole grocery shopping trip with my little daughter and I could hear everything we talked about and all her singing and such very clearly. A previous review said something about not being able to turn off the display drained the batteries BUT Its been 5 months and Ive had to change the batteries once and the current battery reads more than half full. My only complaint would be that the clock is a 24 hour clock. Otherwise - this is a great little tool for those of you who just want help remembering things."
2,Easy to install but stopped working after a year,"This product was very easy to install and use but didn't last very long. After almost a year of trouble-free use, it suddenly stopped working. When I tried to read the contents of my CompactFlash card, the little light would blink like it is working but never stopped to show the contents of the card. I tried to uninstall and then re-installing but without success.I'm not sure if I can by another product like this from SanDisk."
3,Inconsistent with Non-Sony Memory Sticks,"I've had this for about 4 months now, and overall the performance has been spotty, especially with Non-Sony media. My Lexar 128 stick worked fine with this unit for the first few months, but is now a hit or miss affair-- it only recognizes the stick about 50% of the time. A problem with the stick itself? Perhaps. My sony 128 mb stick works well all the time. In any case, I'm replacing this unit with a sony reader. I dont' need the aggravation!"
2,Cleveland reviewer,"I am running WinXP Home. This card reader is not hot-swappable. When trying to do so, the computer locks up and doesn't read anything. The only thing to do is shut off, plug in the reader, reboot, then ensert the cards. Not doing so results in a message that my USB device is malfunctioning. If a card is enserted while rebooting, I get the same message. This reader is NOT a smooth operator. I am now shopping for individual readers instead of a combo."
3,Good one,"This a gay mystery, a good one. In some places it is a bit too sugary and the clues leading to the murderer are handled with a heavy hand but since this is the author's first book, it's understandable and the series itself, further cases solved by Peter and Jeff, looks rather promising. I will definitely check it out. What I did like about this book was that it was all about the characters and plot, so there was very little sex that some authors use to patch empty space. And I really loved the supporting characters."
2,Not as advertised,"This book provides good coverage of Fortran 90 and 95 but the only Fortran 2003 discussion is four pages that list the features. Since I don't think listing the features constitutes ""Coverage"", I have given this book a low rating. I would have given it the lowest rating but the coverage of Fortran 90 and 95 is very helpful to me. I wish the authors had not misrepresented the content in the book's title."
2,Hate it,"It seems to be well-liked by those who like it, but I really don't like it. I'm not saying it's bad, but I think it's not the most appropriate book for me.I'm a statistician who needs to write programs in Fortran for Bayesian computations; I know enough about programming to be dangerous, but also enough to know that I'm not a programmer; I've written lots of lousy code in C and Java before swearing off them years ago; I'd rather program in Perl, S or bash.It seems hard to find good examples (for instance, how do I write a function that returns an array?). The appendix listing intrinsic functions is frequently hard to understand and atrociously designed and formatted.I expect if you read it cover-to-cover, you'd have a good understanding of, e.g., how exactly interfaces work, but it's hard to just jump in and find this information."
1,poor product replacement/solutions,"I purchased Bolle sunglasses, a producto of Bushnell, and tried to have them fixed only to discover that the website instructs mailing the product that needs work, waiting a few weeks, a technician looks at it and then maybe it is covered under warranty. No other contact information is available(that i could find). Thankz for standing by your product Bushnell!"
4,Would be a five except for not working with 12-60.,Amazing as it seems the threads don't extend far enough to mate with the 12-60. I guess they will eventually bring out one that will. In fairness they never said it would work on the 12-60 but since it works on the 72mm threads on the 11-22 I assumed (bad thing I know) that it would work on any 72mm threaded lens. My mistake.
5,Divine !,Maid In England is a must for Divine fans. High energy dance music from the 1980's. Divine was a real performer and loved to show off. This CD is great fun and memorable. It helped Divine go out on a high note. Divine will not be forgotten.
2,Ladies and gentlemen... Divine!,"The late Divine was an actor best known for playing roles in drag in John Waters movies. He also had a recording career singing ""Hi-NRG"" dance music. Hi-NRG was a style of electronic dance music that was popular in Europe in the early 1980s, but never really caught on in America, other than in gay nightclubs. Divine couldn't really sing, but with this kind of music, that's almost besides the point. This particular CD features music he recorded for Proto Records. I actually prefer the earlier material he recorded for ""O"" Records, but there are a few decent songs on here like ""You Think You're a Man"" and ""Walk Like a Man"". Overall, though, the songs are rather repetitive"
1,Fashion Merchandising???,"Working as a Retail/Wholesale Merchandiser in the fashion industry I was expecting an indepth analysis of the theory of what I do. The actual process of getting the right product in the right place at the right time i.e Range Plans, Line Projections, Open to Buy etc etc. However, the book is far too basic, living up to the ""introduction"" part of the title.The book would be ideal for those just starting out in the fashion industry, but not for those who have experience that they are trying to consolidate."
5,The music that inspired Tolkien's Lord of the Rings,"I first heard the music on the National Geographic special on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.It is absolutely beautiful. The music is performed only with Merja's heavenly ""elvish"" voice acompanied only with the Finish lute.If you ever wanted to hear Galadriel or Arwen singing, this is the soundtrack to get!"
3,Cute but a little young,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter and while she loves the Sesame Street theme, it was a bit bulky and uncomfortable to carry around. We returned it and got the ""My First Purse"" instead and she really loves that one. Overall they have the same features, this one is just a lot more bulky because of the hard plastic."
2,Disappointing,"I received this purse almost a year ago and the purse that I got was not the same in the picture, mine didn't come with a cellphone and only had one key on the key chain. I know it doesn't sound like that big of a deal but I almost find the version I got to be boring, plus my daughter loves mirrors and cellphones so I was not happy. I sent the seller many emails that I wanted the version of the purse that is displayed in the picture or a refund and I'd send the purse I got back, but they never replied. I was very disappointed."
3,Needs Improvement,"My 15 month old daughter received this as a gift. While she does enjoy playing with it, there are several aspects that could be improved.1) The ""comb"" is not really a comb - just a solid piece of plastic. Would it be that difficult to make this an actual comb?2) The phone is supposed to squeak when you press the keypad, but ours doesn't. Maybe we just got a dud.3) Trying to fit everything into the purse is nearly impossible for a young child. With some careful planning you can get it all in, but it's a very tight fit."
5,Pawn Stars,"This group of guys makes me laugh. I love the cool stuff that comes into their store. My only complaint is they could use a little better language sometimes, but worth watching."
2,Worthless show,"It felt like a waste of time. The cannon was the only interesting thing. Pointless dialogue. Obviously were saying ""oh boy, there is no story here, what can we fill it with?""."
4,Great show!,"We started watching this show when we stayed overnight in a hotel and me and my fiancee were instantly hooked. Seeing all the different items that come into the store and hearing about their history and what they're worth is fascinating. Also, one of the best things about the show is the family dynamic of the characters. They make the show worth watching and they are hilarious at times. I bought Season 1 and 2 of the show after seeing it on TV and after watching Season 1 it didn't dissapoint. I only wish there were more episodes on Season 1. It only has 16 episodes, I'm guessing because that was their debut season, but Season 2 has double that. All in all I am very satisfied with my purchase.Also, I chose 2 day shipping and I recieved it the very next day. Quick shipping and great product!"
1,"I have Amazon prime but cannot view on my smart TV only desktop, really? WTF? How does this increase your product?","If you are thinking of buying Amazon prime, think twice. If you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon you might break even but otherwise as the song says ""you better think twice."""
2,It's fake,"I know a lot of shows are fake, Man vs. Wild, etc. But this one is pointless because it's fake. Search ""Pawnstars fake"" and see what you come up with. Supposedly these guys don't even buy stuff over the counter anymore. Supposedly History gives people stuff to ""sell"" with a script of what to say and how much to take. If you like watching that, knock yourself out. I used to watch the show every week. Haven't watched it one time since I found out it was fake."
3,"""Reality"" TV","This show is pretty interesting. People bring in interesting things. I could do without the bad language (which is experienced as frequent waves of bleeping""). The family drama typically comes across as contrived too."
3,Good show but the dvd format is fullscreen,A show that is in wide screen 16:9 on tv but they release the DVDs in full screen 1.33. What idiot did this.
1,junk,"pattern of the show:customer comes into the store with old stuff and a very high value expectation,owner off the store, don't belive it's worth that much but i got a friend who is an expert on [where ever the item is from] owner decreases value by at least 50%,customer accepts even if he expected way more...and is happy about it in interview afterwardshurray to scripted reality that is so unreal it should be labeled comedy..."
1,Not full 16:9,When I play this dvd it won't show full screen on my new LED widescreen tv. I have to hit ZOOM to get a decent picture on this...which still crops the sides. Not cool.....the show looks 100x better on cable. A blu-ray would have been nice...but a normal 16:9 would have looked good after an upconvert if they wouldn't have messed with the resolution. Sad....but at least the show itself is awesome.
1,not closed captioned?,"Love this show. But, the DVD I had for season 1 wasn't closed captioned. Disappointing since I couldn't watch it since I can't hear."
4,History Taught by Regulars,First season and interesting comments on items. Can tell Rick is a straight shooter in a city known for double speech and crooked dealings.
5,Great for the whole family,My family loves to sit down in the evening and watch American Pickers together. My wife and I see many items they find and it brings back memories. I love having the kids watch because it is educational for them to learn about these items and their history in an entertaining way. Mike and Frank keep us interested and keep us laughing. All I can say is: Amazon please give us more!!
4,Very good book !,"I'm french and I advice you all to buy this well-ilustrated book, with breathtaking photographs !"
4,"Powerful, compact, and batteries last forever","Finally, someone has solved the problem of the 1980's technology of NiCd batteries dying. B&D;'s product works. It's light, compact, powerful, and loaded with features.Most important, it hold a charge for months. You don't need a spare battery, cause this has a light that shows the state of charge.Very happy!PS: you don't need this if you use your NiCd drill daily, and recharge daily. But if you're an infrequent user... go for it. You'll enjoy having a fully charged drill."
1,Great for a couple years of occasional use then......,"I loved this drill and told many people to buy one because it was great. I got it in May 2008 and since then have only used it occasionally. I would drill a couple holes or drive a few screws then it would sit for weeks or months until I had another small job.Then I decided to build a new front porch. I drove 2 1/2"" deck screws and it started out great. After a few days working a couple hours a day the drill started jumpng out of 1st gear so I had to hold the gear selection button to keep it from jumping out of 1st gear. That wasn't too bad but by the time I was 3/4 done with my porch 1st gear went out all together. 2nd gear still works but that's too fast for screw driving and it has lower torque so burrying the screw head is no good. I had to use my regular wired drill to finish the project. I'm now telling everyone to disregard my previous praise of this drill. I'm getting a new one and it won't be a B&D.; Too bad, I loved this drill."
5,Good little drill,"I purchased this drill on sale for $75 in spring of '09 and it has been great so far. Holds a charge well and is plenty powerful for my projects. That said, the listed price of $129 is more than I would pay for this type of drill but if you can get it on sale like I did it's a great lightweight drill."
4,It is exactly what you would expect,"This is a nice, compact drill/driver. The quality and performance are great for everyday projects and it has the capacity to take on the occasional big job. I like the stand-charger. It is convenient and sturdy. The drill itself is well balanced and has the power to get through most anything you can throw at it. I am looking forward to using the lithium-ion battery and expect it to be a welcome change to the Ni-Cads of the past. I also like the power indicator on the drill itself; nice touch.Too bad that the battery can not be swapped out but I am hopeful that this won't be a problem with the Li-Ion set up.This is a good ""go to"" unit for most day to day needs. That being said, I am glad that I also have my 18v powerhouse with dual batteries for bigger projects to back me up.Nice unit, good price."
4,Lean on Me,"This movie took longer than i thought to get to me, which sucked because i needed it for a class. but it was good quality(for an old movie) and it played just fine (no scratches, etc)."
5,Lean On Me,"Great DVD. Based on a true story. One person can make a difference! Joe Clark ""cleans up"" a troubled high school and improves the quality of education for all."
4,All That's Missing Is the REST of the Screen!,"One of my favorite movies of all time, but why won't they release it in widescreen format?! Until then, it earns ""only"" 4 stars!"
4,Excellent true story movie!,"An excellent movie with great perfomances by all with maybe just a little dramatic license tossed in. I'd be clicking the ""Add to Shopping Cart"" button right this minute if it were presented in widescreen letterbox; AS it should be! What is my HDTV good for if the stupid studios don't start giving us good video media?"
3,"Great performance by Freeman, simplistic movie...","Morgan Freeman gives such an overpowering performance in this film that he alone makes it worth watching. It's not a particularly good film, as everyone else in the film (especially the school administrators) is portrayed as weak, stupid, naive, or easily led. The whole film is set up as Joe Clark is the hero, and anyone who stands in his way is a fool, idiot, or supporter of the old order. I know this is based on a true story, but the film is so night and day in its tone that you know some things are more than likely fabricated. Joe Clark was eventually fired from his job, so he couldn't have been as perfect as he's portrayed here. Still, watching Freeman here is an event in itself. He really makes this film special. John G. Avildsen has to take much of the blame for the simplistic direction. This is one of those films you watch for a great performance, not because the film itself is good."
4,Lean all the way toward seeing this movie!!!,"With so many true story movies out there, I'm glad to say this is a good one. Now, saying that Mr. Clark aka Morgan Freeman did a great job. Sometimes he seems heartless but in the interior of his heart, he does care! I thought there was some funny parts, some great uplifting parts, and parts that made you feel sorry for ""real schools"" that goes through ""real life drama"" of education. I love when they sang in the bathroom the school song, well, the new remix of it. It's a great movie. I like it and recommend it to everyone."
2,Far-fetched and not credible,"When you see the words 'based on a true story', that can mean a lot or a little. I assume this movie adaptation of a true story was only very loosely based on the real life shenanigans at that high school.Morgan Freeman certainly seemed to act like no other teacher I've ever seen, met or been at the wrong end of. He spends his whole time in the movie shrieking, finger-pointing and generally being a thoroughly disagreeable man. Put simply, this behaviour would not have been tolerated (I mean who expels 300 people with only one complaint, or fires a teacher for some petty misdemeanour).Freeman must have been short of cash around the late 1980's in order for him to do this."
5,an excellent movie that you never want to end!!!!,"This is my favorite movie that has came out on video so far. Morgan Freeman does an excellent job in the strict, but determined principal that turns a run down, student run school into a place where learning and education is exciting. The younger students really did a great job of supporting the great acting of Freeman. This is a must see movie to pay close attention to and think long and hard about. Lean On Me has all the basics of an everyday life explained and interpreted through a high school principal. 5 stars!!!!!"
4,Bringing Back Memories,This is a movie a friend wanted to keep because he went to that high school in those days. We watched it and it brought him lots of memory. That's why he dropped out of high school.
5,Leaned on Perfectly,I wanted my children to see an educational movie of how bad it could be in a school system where no one cares. A good movie. A bit dated but Freeman was great none the less.Joe Clark: Discipline is not the enemy of enthusiasm.
5,Wonderful movie,"Wonderful movie! Timeless! Love Morgan Freeman, does a wonderful Job, I could watch it over and over. Highly recomended, is this 17 words yet?"
1,Very outdated and biased book,"I'm glad this book is not sold anymore! When my mother-in-law (a NZer) read it and then came with us to visit Kiev, Lviv, Moscow and some small and mid-sized cities and towns, she said she read your book, but LUCKILY didn't find it to be true!!!I think the author of the book needs to visit Ukraine and Russia soonish and re-write the book, or get some treatment for..., racism, cold war and a shield from what the media brings to your TV screens (everyone knows that only bad news and breakthroughs make news), so please use your brains!I read the book after my mother-in-law's remarks and was sick in my stomach, for quite a while."
3,Not that strong of a smell-,"For the price a bit disappointing, only a mild smell and then it goes away fast. Used in a large ( 50x50) indoor area."
3,Meh...,"Could barely smell it, and I used the whole thing with a quart of fluid too. It's like someone's breath after eating strawberry candy. I'd do vanilla next time."
3,Stained Glass Pattern Review,I am a beginner in stained glass and I would say that this pattern book is for at least intermediates. These are rather complicated patterns suitable for larger flat panels. There were few color pictures and even those were small.
1,"Nice, but impossible to cut!","Lots of very beautiful patterns (that's why I bought it in the first place) but I never made any patterns from it. Why not, you ask? Though I have done many projects requiring tons of grinding with the 1/4"" bit, or over 1400 pieces, the fact is, it's just too discouraging to do.Way too many pieces are uncuttable and require fine carving, and there is no color chart so you don't know whether pieces belong to flower, leaf or sky. You can't even guess!"
3,"Cute, but somewhat dated","Petite Pizazz is a book that is a ""how to"" for sewing designer clothes for ""tots"". There is some good basic information about sewing for children. There is a lot of information about applique and personalizing an outfit. The book includes many photos, which are mostly black and white. Templates are included for the appliques. Many of the ideas can still be used, some would look dated or homemade now. Overall, a pretty good book, but it depends on what you're looking for. This book does not include any patterns."
2,Caused Severe Headaches,"Dim Plus is a wonderful product for most people. Unfortunately, it caused me crippling headaches. It took me 2 weeks to realize it was the product causing the headaches. They were not your average type headache either, but the kind that hurts to even move. I did not take any pills yesterday and this morning is the first time since starting Dim plus that I woke up headache free."
4,no problems,"I was given this supplement by my doctor as part of my Bio-identical hormone replacement therapy. It has been a year and i have had no problems with it. I am not sure I can say it is really doing anything, but I do notice if I miss a dose I get a yeasty, so I suppose it is doing whatever it is supposed to do with helping metabolize estrogen."
5,great game,This was a birthday gift for a 9 year old boy. He and his 10.5 year old brother loved the game. They had played it at a friends and requested it by name. But having it at home to play with all the time did not reduce the thrill of it. They love being able to choose which team to be and sometimes play Texas A&M for both sides since they both are Aggie fans. The 9 year old has picked up playing strategies from this game that he uses in backyard games.
5,The best thirty dollars I ever spent.,"I run a large nightclub, and I'm always looking for new things to do to keep my club on the edge. This book has given me and my DJ's months of new things to do that everyone is talking about. The writer also gave me some great ideas about things to do in my room and with people that I never heard before."
5,Make Some Noise,"I have read this book, cover to cover, and continually use it as a reference guide to help me increase my club business in West Chester, PA. I would recommend this book to anyone, who wants to be successful in the club business."
1,200% MARKUP!!!,"Why are these vendors selling this book used when it can be purchased directly from the author NEW for $49.95? It's a matter of Googling ""dj chuck fresh games book""."
4,Awesome!,"After seeing how far this band has come along, I have to say that this debut album is a pop-sational hit! I definately recommend this album to anyone looking for fresh new sounds that are sure to have you singing along the second you hear it!"
1,Didn't like it,"Have to agree with the other reviewers. My main complaint is poor sound quality. In theory, this unit would be great. Digital offers many advantages over cassette tape. Indexing is a great feature that allows user to locate key passages easily. But playback is noisy and recording is faint. I thought it might be my particular until but I exchanged it for another and had same problem. Also, the continuous display drains batteries quickly."
1,"i've wasted my money, now i'm wasting my time","These things suck bad. They statred falling apart within a few days. I wouldn't try doing anything more strenuous than making snowballs with these, and even then they'll probably fall apart."
2,Not Durable,"I needed gloves to go skiing. I found these. These were junk. The literally fell apart after 2 weekends of skiing. I would not recommend this product unless it is for light, occasional use."
5,Another masterpiece from this brilliant bass player !,"Another masterpiece from the brilliant bassist Jamaal. This time, he shares the same stage with another three bass players in an amazing live concert. Tracks names are:What's mine is yours 10:43All praises due 22:11Boney blues 11:01Black pearls 06:37Ovations 2:41"
2,Is Nikon run by Dr. Evil?,"Before returning the heavily flawed Nikon 8800 (see my review), I started flirting with extras like this battery pack. It costs 170 bucks and is basically a very cheap feeling battery case with buttons for zoom and shutter. Said buttons feel EXTRA cheap. It's nice that nikon made this available (There is only an aftermarket version for my D70 which replaced the 8800), but a better job and lower price might have dropped the insult warp factor a bit. Even the guy at B&H; laughed at it when he opened the box. Luckily the 8800 has good battery life anyway, so if you really don't need this, don't get it.Capt RB"
3,Nikon Battery Pack For Coolpix 8800,"This is a great item, but the buttons don't work on the device. The battery pack does though"
3,"Wrong color, but good product","Received ivory instead of white from Sydney's. Order was ""Fulfilled by Amazon"", so I had no trouble returning it and getting a prompt refund. I have purchased the white cover plates elsewhere, and find this to be a very good product for determining hot and cold spots in my residence."
3,Problematic unit,"Ad a tough time getting the unit to be recognized on several computers. It you happen to have a computer that likes this reader, it works just fine. But some older computers never recognized this unit no matter what I tried. The SanDisk SDDR-95-A15 xD / SM Reader is a much better buy if you need to read Smartmedia"
1,Sometimes it works . . .,"Sometimes it doesn't work! I've had mine for a year now, and I have checked for updated drivers.I use mine with Windows XP Professional. I've used it to read smart media cards and compact flash cards, and in both instances I often get screen freezes when trying to access the cards. Then I have to reboot.Sometimes I have to reboot three or four times before the thing works right. What's up? I dunno. I'm not a newbie. I've tried a variety of fixes, including reinstalling the driver, unplugging the USB cable and trying a different slot, and standing on my head when inserting the cards. This device is not reliable.When it does work, after two or three reboots, it works just fine.Try a different brand."
4,Review,"Great tracer, easy to use, and constructed to last. The only deficiency is that it needs additional plug-in test terminals such as Ethernet jack and coaxial connector, which I added myself."
4,not nearly as bad as all that!,"I think Bob W is being a little rough on this record; to my ear the contrasting sensibilities of Ralph & John give this record its color- Also, I rather enjoy the relatively casual feel of Sargasso, although I agree with Bob that Abercrombie has grown by leaps & bounds as a player in the ensuing years. Regarding the notion of hearing these 2 players have another go at it, they did just that 5 years later on the ECM LP ""Five Years Later"" and it is indeed a superior session. Inexplicably ECM have never, to my knowledge, reissued this 2nd duo album on cd. I've always wonder just why..."
3,Appreciating the skeptic,"I feel the assessment by ""A Customer""is a bit harsh, but hits at least one nail on the head, and I compliment him for not simply flattering these fine musicians. My experience of this album from day one - and I ENJOY it - is that it is cruder, less attunement in evidence than on Five Years Later and both guys' later music. Abercrombie's playing has seemed to evolve from a certain noodling quality, like a bright person who talks too loud, mixes up his grammar and never finishes a sentence, to a really articulate and impressionistic maturity most evident on the latest quartet album. Towner, too, has evolved, but has always been a classically disciplined and articulate player, however, spontaneous. This is a vital and enjoyable album, for me, in spite and maybe also because of its strange rawness."
4,Two Master Melodists Inhabiting the Same Dream,"I hate to say this, but I don't know what the previous reviewer's been smoking. Sargasso Sea is an exquisite album, both guitarists at the top of their form -- Abercrombie fluid and stinging by turns, Towner crystalline. The only reason I didn't give this lovely record five stars is the tunes are rather loose: this record doesn't exactly swing. But it's a ruminative, slightly melancholy, perfect album for a rainy afternoon and late at night when you want music that deepens your own thoughts. ""Parasol"" is one of Towner's gem-like compositions -- I would have loved to have heard the Bill Evans Trio with Scott LaFaro cover it!"
3,Well . . .,"If basic is what you want, basic is what you will get. Even then I was surprised to find such cheap hinges were used in the manufacture. Some were even broken when attached! We asked for replacements and 10% discount since we had to fix a ""new"" item. We got both. The cork is way too thin to attach anything to it but it serves our purposes."
2,Not worth the money,"While the item isn't bad it is not worth the money I paid for it. Each panel is solidly constructed and though each does not look bad it does look like it is made of castoffs, but it is real wood at least. The cork is so thin that it will not hold much more than a 3/4 pages before it falls out. If I would have paid about $100 less for the screen then it might have been worth it. The item was packed extremely well for shipping. Double boxed with cardboard and plastic cushioning spacers around each corner on the outside of the second box so it could take ruff handling without damage to screen."
4,Work nice,"These bottles work nice and are a good option to try for babies who are having problems with fussiness or gas. They seem to reduce the amount of bubbles and make the feedings easier for our little one. (We also use the Doctor Brown bottles). I haven't noticed a big difference in performance between the two, but these are easier to clean."
5,So easy to clean!,"If you don't have a dishwasher, it is so very hard to get a bottle clean - especially if you rinsed it & tossed it in your diaper bag during a day away from home. These made cleaning so much easier since the top and bottom come off. Surprisingly, they did not leak! They also do really reduce the amount of air a baby takes in while feeding."
2,Would not recomend this product!,"I was really excited to use these ""venting"" bottles. I have twins, so made sure we stocked up. After about two feedings we realized that they leak!! Also, the markings on the side wear off easily, so make sure you don't scrub the outside. I would highly recomend using the Drop-In system for several reasons 1)Less washing (only have to wash the ring and nipple..I only rinse the bottle since no formula actually touches it) and 2)It works like it says...no air"
1,They leak!,"Used the old design when our 3yo was a baby and they were great. But the new design leaks, leaks, leaks! Called Playtex - they said to assemble the bottles dry and they sent me some new o-rings. I tried again but they still would leak significantly from time to time. The seal can be broken by the baby sucking or if you drip some formula down the side of the bottle when you're filling it. There's nothing like having to heat up a fresh bottle in the middle of the night because the first one leaked all over the table when you stopped to burp the baby. Buy something else until Playtex fixes the design."

1,UNSATISFIED MOMMY,MY DAUGHTER IS 3MONTHS OLD AND I'VE BEEN USING THESE BOTTTLE WITH LITTLE SATISFACTION I ONLY HAVE 6 BOTTLES AND EACH DAY THAT I FILL THEM WITH FORMULA 5 OUT OF 6 OF THEM LEAK I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING BUT THEY STILL LEAK. THEY ARE ALSO VERY HARD TO CLEAN AROUND THE RIMS IF YOU LET THE FORMULA SET MORE THAN A FEW HOURS I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH THESE BOTTLES AT ALL.
2,Not Really Worth The Trouble....,"I registered for the Vent Aire bottles soley by reading up on them on-line. However, when it came time to actually use them, boy, what a chore. My little guy got NOTHING from the stage one nipples and as for the stage 2, he choked on his formula every time. They're not very convenient if you have a screaming hungry baby and give him a bottle where he gets nada from the nipple. Playtex has a good reputation and a good product name. However, I will NEVER buy this particular product ever again."
3,Switch nipples,"at first my baby wouldn't take to these bottles, but i was determined to use them. i know people that have them and they love them. i kept trying to give them to him, but ended up using dr. brown's. one day i out a dr. brown nipple with the bottle and it worked perfectly. i just threw all the playtex nipples out and use the dr. brown nipples. they fit perfectly and the nipple doesn't collapse."
1,Dr. Brown to the rescue.,"When my neighbor had to have emergency surgery I was asked to watch her new baby. She had two different bottles, the VentAire and the DR. Brown bottles. I was not happy at all with the VentAire bottles. They were difficult to assemble and the baby cried because the formula just wouldn't come out of the nipple. I was growing frustrated and decided to try the Dr. Brown bottles instead and was THRILLED. What a difference. They do take a little bit more time to prepare than a regular bottle, but I think they are worth the time and money. With permission I bought her 5 more of the Dr. Brown bottles."
1,Not Worth the $10.99,"I received the playtex disposable system at my shower and used them bottles for the first month. I noticed my baby was drooling A LOT of formula out the sides of hs mouth. It was so bad that he soaked through whatever was under his chin onto his cloths, forcing us to change after every feeding. I then baught a three pack of the ventair with stage one nipples. My son sucked and sucked and sucked, but got nothing. We tried to open them up to get formula out of them, but that did not work. I would suggest the Dr. Brown's bottles over both the disposable and the Ventaire."
2,"Nice idea, but leaves you wanting more - like a new bottle.","Initially, we thought these looked promising. However, we soon discovered some significant shortcomings:- The 'seal' at the bottom clogs up, making it much harder for the baby to feed.- The nipples seem to clog as well.- They're a bigger hassle to clean. The little seal at the bottom can be a real pain to put back in.- The markings are hard to read, made even more so by the location on the bottle. It's hard to see them while you're filling the bottle.We have several of these, but will not likely use them again."
4,I didn't received what I ordered,I ordered the Playtex VentAire Bottles but instead I received the new version of these bottles (The wide ones). I decided to use but it was a bad idea. The botton's valves doesn't works...I received the wrong products and the ones that I received broke down the second time I use it. I am very disapointed.
1,SOOO Frustrated!,"What a waste of money! These had great reviews when I first started researching bottles. I bought several of them (around 10) and the stage one nipples worked great at first. My daughter is now six weeks old and a week ago these bottles stopped working! I never had a problem with them leaking, but now the nipple either collapses or nothing comes out! I have to unscrew the cap and then she can get some out, but twice now (in the middle of the night) I forgot that the cap was unscrewed and it went EVERYWHERE! Not to mention I could feel the air come out of the open end obviously creating more gas issues! It takes her a half an hour to drink 3 ounces! Tonight I will be buying new bottles and obviously a new brand. What a disappointment!"
1,Not Worth The Money!!!,"I purchased these bottles when I was still pregnant thinking that they would be great for the switch between breastfeeding and bottle feeding. At first they were ok, a bit confusing perhaps but still working alright. Then they started leaking. I read the instructions on how to heat them up and I did it the way it was detailed and they would still leak. Not just one of them but all of them. If you're a breastfeeding mom, you know how important that milk can be for a newborn; it's gold! I would lose a few ounces which would mean I'd go and have to pump more to make up for it. So I just threw them out and opted to go for Avent Natural bottles instead. Haven't had a problem with them at all. So just save your money. Sure they're cute but I'd rather have a full, happy baby :)"
1,A Dreadful Product,"I have never before written a product review - good or bad - on any website, but these bottles motivated me to speak. They are horrible. What is most shocking is that their gimmick is that no air comes in from the nipple, but the only times my children used them air not only rushed in through the nipple but did so in a violent manner. It looked like a gyser erupting.It would seem that the vent at the bottom of the bottle is so tempermental that it vapor locks for any reason or for no reason at all. When that happens, your child will have to suck like mad to get any milk until the negative pressure in the bottle overwhelms him or her and tries to suck his or her insides out. Steer clear."
1,These bottles suck!!,"I bought these bottles for my new granddaughter and have had nothing but problems with the bottom leaking!! She has a problem with gas and I thought these would be an improvement over the traditional bottle--no way!! She sucked so hard on the nipples, she got a blister on her upper lip. We discovered that part of the problem was the bottom ring was too tight, and loosing it slightly helped the baby have to suck less hard. They worked fine when brand new, but after several uses...I have had several lapfuls of formula and she has gotten regular formula baths. We are going to a different bottle now. I do not recommend them other than the fact they are easier to clean."
3,"Decent product, probably a little over-priced","If you plan to bottle-feed your baby, Playtex's Ventaire should be on your list of considerations. While the ""we take away the air from your baby"" claim is probably just marketing hype -- and an invitation to a class-action someday?? -- the Ventaire does seem to work for some babies, provided you follow the instructions and hold the bottle right.Reviewer M. Gunderson is half right, IMHO, about the nipples. Stage 1 nipples are indeed too slow; even I had trouble sucking anything out of one. (I assumed I was a better sucker than the baby!) Stage 2, though, was like a floodgate that suddenly opens. Finding the right nipple, then, is the challenge. Luckily, the Ventaire uses the standard American nipple size so you have lots of choices (unlike, say, the British Avent)."
4,Colicky babies need these!!!,My son had the worst problems with colic. These are simply wonderful keeping the gas in their tummies down. Hardly any bubbles when feeding him meant he was getting formula not air. The only problem i had was taking the bottles apart for cleaning. If you dont have a dishwasher i suggest playtex disposable nursers or some wider bottles such as avent or gerber new traditions. i think Dr brown makes wide mouth bottles now too
3,"Nice bottles, but vents and nipples are sporatic","After smashing my baby's nose and cleaning up milk from all over his face for a few weeks with regular playtex bottles, we tried VentAire bottles. The angled neck helped with feeding positions, but made it a little tricky to fill while holding a baby in one arm. The narrow top kept his nose from being smashed. The set of nipples that came with the bottles were okay, but when I bought replacements, they were so tough that my baby couldn't get the milk out no matter how hard he sucked. Also, we found that, even though they are supposed to be vented from the bottom so air bubbles don't form and you don't build up a vaccuum, the vents rarely work. We see bubbles forming from the nipple and my son can collapse the nipples (especially the harder replacement ones). We still use them, but we're careful to select the softer nipples when we feed him."
2,Stage 1 nipple extremely slow,"I am breast-feeding my daughter and introduced her to the bottle when she was five weeks old using this bottle with the stage 1 nipple. It seemed with work fine for her at first because the stage 1 nipple is very slow and prevented her from choking. We tried Avent bottles and the newborn nipple was way too fast for her at that age. Once she started day care when she was 12 weeks old, I had to switch her to Avent bottles with newborn nipples because the flow on the stage 1 nipple was way too slow. It would take her 45 minutes to get down 2 ounces with the Ventaire and it only took 15 minutes to get down 4 ounces with the Avent. I thought about switching her to stage 2 Ventaire nipples but I worried that the nipple might be too fast and since we're still breast-feeding, I wanted a bottle that was as close to the breast as possible. I wish these bottles had more choices of nipple flow."
1,Don't believe it's better!,"I got these bottles to avoid the spit up, gas, etc. It may have worked if my newborn could have gotten the formula out. By the time he got through fighting to get a few drops out he was exhausted. No baby should have to work that hard for his meal. I hated these bottles and took them back to the store even after using them. I started using a store brand bottle that is angled and he enjoys it much better."
5,the only one!,"I use these bottles with my newborn son and they are great. I am currently breast-feeding but supplement with a couple of bottles during the day. The stage 1 nipple may be hard for some newborns, but was perfect for mine because he sucked so hard. He would end up wearing most of his other bottles. With these he still had to work at getting the formula which also enabled us to keep breast-feeding. My first child didn't want to nurse after having bottles because she got used to having her milk faster. The stage 2 nipples work well not only for older babies but also for newborns who don't have a real strong suction or who are used to faster flowing bottles. They are easy to clean and maintain and don't leak at all. They also really do help with my baby getting less air. I love these bottles. They are the only ones I use now."
5,NO GAS AND PLENTY OF MILK,I LOVE THESE BOTTLES. I USED THEM FOR MY TWO YEAR OLD AND NOW FOR MY TWO MONTH OLD. THE VENT WORKS. THE BABY SUCKS THE MILK AND THE VENT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE LET THE AIR COME IN SO THAT THE NIPPLE DOES NOT COLAPSE LIKE THE TRADITIONAL BOTTLES DO.THE BABY GETS MORE MILK AND LESS AIR. THE VENT ON THE BOTTOM ALLOWS THE AIR TO GET THROUGH SO WHEN THE BABY IS SUCKING AIR DOES NOT GO IN THROUGH THE NIPPLE CAUSING HER TO DRINK AIR AND GET GAS I LOVE THESE BOTTLES.
1,****NUMBERS WASH OFF****,I bought these because I loved the old standard bottles. I never had a problem with them at all. When I got these after a couple washes the number markings started to come right off!I called Playtex about this and they sent me new bottles directly from them and guaranteed that they would not rub off because they had reformulated the ink on the bottles. They don't have it right yet.THE NUMBERS STILL COME OFF WHEN WASHED!!!These bottles do not leak at all. I do make sure all the pieces are dry when assembled. They work perfectly if you don't care if you know how much is in the bottle. I have to use a measuring cup to make sure I have the appropriate amount of water to formula ratio. Of course I just estimate how much is left in the bottle after feedings.I also bought some crystal clear ventaire bottles. They are working perfectly.
2,"Nipple Problem, among others!","These bottles are horrible to deal with! My baby would suck until he was worn out because nothing would come out of the nipple. I stretched the holes, which worked a little. Then after using them about 2 months the bottom ""vent"" started leaking. Plus you have to disassemble the entire bottle(4 pieces)to wash and then assemble them back together.The person, probably a man, that invented these bottles must not have had a hungry newborn they were trying to feed.I finally switched to just a cheap, old-fashioned bottle by Evenflo and it works great. Just wish I wouldn't have wasted my time and money on the Playtex bottles."
2,Problems with no flow/slow flow,"What's the deal with these bottles? Sometimes they've worked, and other times my little girl (3wks old) can't get a drop out of them. I check and double check each time I prepare a bottle to make sure I correctly assemble the bottom ""vent"" parts. Like Holly, I also called the Playtex customer service number and they said the nipples are not ""free flow"" nipples so the baby isn't supposed to place her mouth around the entire nipple, only the tip of the nipple. It would have been nice if Playtex would have mentioned this in the instruction booklet. After trying to get my baby to suck off the ""tip"" of the nipple I'm still having flow problems. I will say that the bottles helped reduce my little girl's gas, however, it's frustrating when I have to stop in the middle of a feeding and transfer the remaining formula to another bottle because of no flow/slow flow problems. I'm going to try Dr. Brown's bottles next."
1,HATE THE NIPPLES,"I am using the ventaire bottle with a 5 day old. She can not get any formula out of the stage 1 nipples, & the stage 2 nipples are TOO free flowing, making her choke. I am going to try a different nipple, even though the manufacturer says only their nipples will work correctly."
2,STAY AWAY FROM THIS,"I don't have a problem with the bottle, even though it is a bit of a pain to clean and assemble. On the other hand, the nipples suck. Stage 1 nipple is too slow and barely any milk comes out of it. Our baby would grow tired while sucking on it and could never finish her milk. Stage 2 is too fast. Our baby would constantly choke while drinking the milk and eventually refused to drink using this nipple."
2,"Better bottle, Bad nipple","I've got a 2 week old. We started with the Playtex Nurser Bottles. Great bottles, but the nipple was way too large for my son's mouth and he got a blister on his top lip. So I tried Gerber for newborns...smaller nipple, but more bubbles and gas for baby. So I bought this VentAire because it has a smaller nipple AND is good for gas. But my son sucked on it for 5 minutes and got nothing out of it. Then I realized that the nipple doesn't just have a hole in it like other bottles do. It has the slit-type hole, and the baby has to be squeezing the very tip if anything's going to come out. Well babies don't suck that way. They suck at the wider part, naturally. But we solved our problem by taking the nipple off of the Gerber bottle and use it on the VentAire bottle. (They tell you not to do this.) But it works perfectly now...no gas, no sucking problems. Whew!"
3,I can't find a stage I like!,"I thought these bottles would be excellent. I can't find a nipple to suit my baby. She is ten weeks old. The stage 1 nipple is sooooooooo slow and the stage 2 nipple is really fasts, she chokes and cries. I don't know, I think I'm going back to the disposables (PlayteX). But they are a pain because you have to either buy the drop ins, which are expensive or the liners, which are a pain in the butt. Who knows. I'm not sure which direction I'm going in."
3,not practical,although these bottles were great in helping decrease gas the nipples holes were quite small i had to use a fork to open them up more. When reading the directions you can't use a bottle warmer or boiling water. How do u sterilize them?? Heating the bottle up took forever because you can only use warm water. who has time to wait that long with a hungry baby??
4,Great Bottles!!!!,"I bought these bottles and they are Great! The Stage One nipples are alittle bit of a pain, but if you pinch the nipple they seem to work better. Otherwise nothing will come out. The Stage One nipples are a very slow flow, great for baby that tends to spit the formula back up. Helps with tummy. Stage Two nipples are great on the older children my daughter loves them."
4,bottle works great for baby who has trouble sucking,"Our three-week-old has poor suction. With normal bottles, to get him to eat well, I have to loosen the nipple ring, and that leads to leaks--the cloth under his chin will be covered with milk. I use a Ventaire we bought about two years ago together with a (new) Nuk nipple (he doesn't seem to like round nipples very much, though it may just be that we started with the Nuk), and it works great. To get faster flow, I can just tighten the nipple ring but loosen the bottom ring, and as long as I remember not to set it down on it (which is hard) I get decent flow without any leaks."
4,Best bottles to prevent gas,"I tried the avent bottles and the bottles that came with my breastpump (medela). All of these bottles gave my son gas so bad. If you pull the bottle away from the babies mouth to burp him, all the bubbles in the bottle shoot up to the nipple and then into his mouth. I heard about the Playtex one and I was only disappointed that I didn't know about them sooner. I got them when my son was 2 months and we are still enjoying them at almost 7 months. There are NO bubbles which can cause gas. These are the best bottles. If you read the reviews where the parent could not get the milk out of the bottle, its because the nipples are new and you have to pinch them to open them slightly and then they work just fine. I will say that once he was 3 months I switched to the 6 month and older nipple which he adjusted to just fine and he now drinks a 6 oz bottle in about 5 minutes. You have to try these! No gas for your baby. How can you not?"
1,Toss them out!,"After trying these bottles for a week, I tossed them all out. My son was continuing to have alot of gas, and was unable to adequately get the formula from the nipples. When I called Playtex, and asked what I could do to make it easier for him to get the formula, I was told that if I used any other nipple than the Vent Air nipple, it would negate the benefits of using this system. The representative also said that newborns have a harder time since they are trying to put the whole top portion of the nipple in their mouth instead of just the tip of the nipple. Since you can't reason with a newborn to try drinking their bottle another way, I gave up."
2,suck...suck.... suck.....,I have a 3 month old. She doesn't enjoy these bottles as good as she does the Playtex with the Drop-ins. They work perfect for her. She was a colicky baby and the Playtex was better on gas. Those bottles were perfect. I wouldn't waste my money on these. The Playtex are better and much easier to clean since you don't have much time with an infant.
4,Work great,"These bottles are working great for my both 19 and 5th months. Although I agree with the fact that cheaper bottles do the trick, my children prefered these from all other I tried. A lot have to do with the nipple. Any way, what ever are your intentions, that's your child that's going to choose his bottle !!"
4,Does the job,"I purchased a set of these bottles after having problems with the playtex nurser system. We had a hard time finding a nipple with a flow speed that worked for our daughter, plus my husband didn't like having to mess with the bags. I was reluctant to change, but I finally bought one of these to try. Although I don't think the bottles actually reduce gas like they claim to, my daughter seems to do much better with the tri-cut nipples. She's been using the stage 2 nipples since she was a month old. It's also nice to be able to take both ends off for washing. I think they get much cleaner that way."
2,Use only for older babies,"My son is now 2 weeks old. we bought these bottles thinking they would work great. Well with the stage 1 nipples he could't get anything out and with the stage 2 nipples he was coking. We had some of the Dr. Brown bottles, so we tried those. They are a life saver. He can drink out of them just fine. He has not been gassy once. We went back to babies r us and bought 3 more packages of the dr. brown bottles. They do cost a little more, but are well worth it."
3,OKAY -NOT THE BEST,"Nipple Flow: The Stage 1 nipples for newborns has the slowest flow under the sun, but our son prefers this type of flow so the Ventaire system worked for us.Comparison with Dr. Brown's: Dr. Brown's are much easier to assemble. The Ventaire bottle has a plastic piece that suctions onto the inside-bottom of the bottle which has to fit PERFECTLY and be totally dry in order to prevent the leaks that everyone complains about. This gadget is a pain in the dark and in the middle of the night! However, the Ventaire did seem to work just as well as Dr. Brown's and they are much cheaper. Dr. Brown's stage 1 nipple flow is slower than most other stage 1 brands, but a little faster than our son prefers.Overall Recommendation: If you're on a budget, have a BRIGHT nightlight or pre-assemble these during the day, and have an infant who prefers slow flow, these may work for you."
2,Does it work?,"For a supposedly airless system, my 3 week old manages to produce a lot of bubbles into the bottle. Both my husband and I have read and followed the instructions explicitely and she still manages to introduce bubbles while sucking. No one else seems to be having this problem, so I'm a bit confused as to what we're doing wrong.Anyway, while researching this problem, I came across the phone number for Playtex where you can order replacement valves and caps. Since several reveiwers had remarked that they had been unable to find replacement parts, I thought I'd post this information as an FYI.From the Playtexbaby.com website:"" I need replacement parts for my VentAire or other bottle system (rings, caps, vents, etc.)? I can't find them for sale anywhere.Parts for our systems can be misplaced. These parts are not sold separately in stores due to the limited availability of shelf space. We would be happy to provide a limited quantity of complimentary parts if you contact us at 1-800-222-0453"""
1,Don't waste the time or $,"These bottles are no good because they are a pain to clean, and the nipples only come in 2 sizes: Stage 1- (0-6 mos) and Stage 2-(6 months and up). The stage one nipples are WAY too slow for my three month old and the stage two nipples are way too fast! I tried to make the holes bigger but it ripped the nipple. And..you can not use any other nipples with this bottle, because the nipples are ventless. What a racket!"
3,did not work as expected,"We got these bottles for my 2 month old daughter and we noticed after 20 minutes nothing was coming out of them, so we opened the hole in the nipple with a push pin and it started to work. However, we still found that there were lots of bubbles in the liquid. Warming the bottles is a bit of a pain because you can not warm with the nipple on, which in one case made a huge mess when my husband dropped the bottle taking it out of the warmer. I wish I could return them, but I threw out the package. Some advice, Save ALL the packaging for anything you buy."
4,Great Bottles,"I have a 2 wk old and started bottlefeeding due to lack of breastmilk. After trying Gerber, Evenflo, and Advent and still getting lots of gas we decided to try these. We saw a difference immediatly. The only reason I give it 4 stars vs 5 is because you can't heat these bottles in the bottle warmer. So we have to heat the bottle and then pour it into the Playtex. But we have not had any problems with leaking and they are easy to clean and assemble."
1,LEAKY BOTTLE,"I thought I would love these bottles when I first got them, boy was I wrong!!! First, you really have to check the nipples because they are perforated and you have to actually make sure the nipple holes are open. Second, after a few times of washing the bottom leaks!! This is the worst thing about them, after putting freshly pumped milk in there it was all over my counter! Talk about disappointment. I have other family member who have the same complaint about them. Seriously think about another bottle when purchasing!"
5,BEST BOTTLES AVAILABLE,"I've used this since my baby was born and she has done great with them! She's never had issues with spitting up or having gas. Now that she is 9 months old and likes to feed herself, she can easily hold it up so that she can get milk and not air unlike other kids at her daycare that seem to suck on air for awhile before they need help tilting it up more. The angle of the bottle is wonderful! It is so comfortable for me when I feed her (when she lets me!). I recommend these bottles and will use them when I have another baby in the future."
5,No Problem,I used these bottles with my first child. The only problem I had was that the stage 1 nipple seemed hard for my son to suck from. All I did was take the stage 2 nipples from my 9oz. bottles and replace them. We used these bottles for a year and never once had a problem with any kind of leaking. I love these bottles because they are so easy to clean. I love the fact that you can take the bottom off to clean. With regular bottles you have to work to get all of the stuff off of the bottom. Believe me this makes cleaning so much easier. I am currently pregnant with my second child and plan to continue to use the Ventair bottles.
5,My Reflux and Collicky baby Loved this bottle,I really think this bottle is truly great. My son was breastfed for five months before he was finally diagnosed with reflux and colick this was the bottle that worked in the clutch of rapidly weaning him from the breast in a very short amount of time. We tried Avent and Dr. Browns with the wide necks. My son would not latch on properly. We finally tried these and he was downing bottles of milk with no fussing almost immediately.
4,Good transition bottle for my newborn,"We all have our likes and our dislikes and I think it's the same for our babies. What works for one baby may or may not work for another. However, it took us 3 sets of bottles to find ones that my newborn handled well. The Playtex VentAire were one of them!! He gets much less air in his belly and I find them pretty easy to use. Just be sure to keep the rubber vent piece on the bottom clean. He absolutely hated the Playtex disposable bottles and didn't care for Avent either. So, it's the VentAire and Johnson's Healthflows for him. He gets less air in his belly and seems happy. But my advice is still to experiment to see what makes your baby happy!!"
1,Leaks,"If you want an expensive bottle that leaks expensive formula this is the one for you. Contacted playtex and they suggested I send them in so they could determine the cause. It's not rocket science. The ""seal"" in the bottom doesn't work. Great customer service when you suggest I spend more money on the bottles to ship them back. Switched to Avent. My twins actually feed better and they're guaranteed leak free."
5,Best bottles we have tried yet,"I have tried a variety of bottles with nieces, nephews, kids at daycares, and my own son. These are my favorites. We have some of the basic Gerber bottles that were used at the baby shower. They are awful! Too much air gets in my baby's tummy and he just cries. I love these! The only two issues we've had are 1) getting the bottom on right when you are half asleep (far better to prepare ahead of time) and 2) the numbers on the ones from the newborn kit have rubbed off quite a bit (although the other pack we got is still in perfect condition). Looking to buy some more of the ""big"" ones now that my son is 4 months old and eating more. The smaller ones just don't hold 6 ounces of formula very well (it can but its a tight fit the way we prepare it). Anyway, looking forward to using them with our next (which is on the way)."
3,Just ok,"We have tried a lot of different kinds of bottles and these weren't really anything spectacular. Our (older) baby was weirded out by the curved shape and not quite sure how to get comfortable holding it, but obviously that wouldn't be a problem if you started out with them necessarily. I didn't see any difference as far as ""gas"" with these; I'm inclined to believe that marketing makes excessive claims about these things, especially on baby products."
5,baby bottles advanced,my wifes cousin just had a baby boy here a couple weeks ago. i got these bottles for her since she is breast feeding. she uses a breast pump and freezes the milk. then thaws it out an puts in the bottles for him. she said these bottles work great. they are easy to use. the baby does not get air bubbles or much gas from the bottle feeding. i asked her how she would rate the bottles. she advised that she would buy them for they work great. 01-20-2012 update. since the boys is older ( and bigger ) he really likes these bottles for he gets more volume. he is a chow hound and these bottles work great since they have a greater flow. the babies momma really likes these bottles
3,Save your money,"We tried this on my granddaughter who was having a hard time feeding with other bottles. With others, we either couldn't get the flow to give her enough food or we had those that fed her too much, too fast and she would choke. With these VentAire bottles, my granddaughter seemed to be a bit irritated and eventually rejected it. My daughter in law couldn't figure out why the baby was not receiving the bottle and thought maybe it was the formula. That is, until she tried to suck through the nipple herself. Her suction is more powerful than the babies, so we were convinced these were just not the bottles for my grand child. I say save your money on this one. And at $24 for 3 bottles, I'm sure there is a better option."
4,Pretty good,"Keeps gas at a minimum and are easy to prep. I like how they fit perfectly in my nephews mouth and the crook of my arm as he is feeding. The only drawback I experienced is that with so many parts to clean (it breaks down to five parts), clean up can be cumbersome."
2,Not impressed,"I didn't know that the nipples could not be boiled...first time I tried to feed my baby he couldn't get anything to come out...the nipple opening was closed. Then I replaced the nipple with one from a Gerber bottle and formula dripped out all over the baby and lots and lots of air caused discomfort. Even when I did use the other Ventaire nipple that worked, I noticed my baby did not like it. I am just going to stick with the good old regular, reliable Gerber bottles that can be boiled, dishwasher safe and easily interchangeable. They are cheaper, too!"
2,not good for sleepy babies,"I bought these before my baby was born (this is my fourth) and she would always fall asleep before finishing the bottle. Therefore, at naptime she would only sleep 10 to 20 minutes before waking up and wanting more. I couldn't understand the problem, but I went out and bought some of the playtex nursers. The very first day she sleep for hours instead of minutes. I believe the holes in the nipples were too small and she wasn't getting enought. She was a 9 pound baby. I would recommend the nursers over the Ventaire. Being able to use the disposable liners were also a plus if you have little time, like most people do."
2,Watch for MOLD!,"Watch out! The lip right beneath the nipple, on the bottle has groves which are practically impossible to get 100% clean. We didn't realize until very close inspection that mold was growing in ALL of them."
1,A waste of money,"These bottles suck! A complete waste of money, maybe my daughter will use them to play with her dolls years down the road. They are a HUGE pain to use. For one you can't use a bottle warmer (the water seeps up into bottle). We had to hold it under running water which takes forever. It took my daughter FOREVER to drink the bottle from the nipples. If you are concerned about gas use Dr. Brown's bottles, they have more parts but easy to put together."
3,Good for my older baby,"I, like so many others, had a problem with the flow when I first used these bottles. I originally just grabbed them off the shelf at the store because my preferred brand was out, and these were six ounce bottles, so I thought they'd be perfect. My son was about 2 months old at the time, and the second time I used them, he kept sucking and nothing came out. We finally noticed that THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO HOLE IN THE NIPPLE!!! We immediately tossed that nipple and put these bottles away.Once my son was old enough to hold his own bottle, I brought these back out with a Stage 2 nipple. They work great now. They are light and easy for him to hold, plus the tilted neck helps him get those last drops without frustration. He's eight months old now, and he has no problems whatsoever with them.I do recommend the Dr. Brown's bottles over these, though, especially the wide neck ones. They are expensive, but I have been nothing but pleased with them."
1,Not for me,"I purchased two of these bottles, and returned them the next day. My baby could not get anything out of them. I tried sucking on them myself and at first nothing would come out of the nipple, then I could somehow get it to work, and then it wouldn't work again. I called playtex, and they told me the baby's mouth has to be above the little lines on the nipple. I tried everything, even another nipple, but it was useless. After dealing with a worn out (and hungry) baby, I would have to say these are useless. I find myself pretty bright when it comes to figuring things out, but this bottle was beyond my ability. Feeding a baby should be simple!"
4,A good bottle!!!!!,"I really liked these bottles.My daughter would not use any other bottle andd we found these and they worked great for her. I do agree that the stage 2 nipple come out much to fast they pretty much drown her, although they did work when I put a little cereal in her bottle I would use those nipples and she could drink that without getting drowned. Overall I do like the bottles I do think they need to come in different colors and what about a little design on them...I would use them again and I also have 2 friends that are using them also and they are satisfied..."
4,So glad I found these bottles,"I have three children and have always used standard bottles. I love the fact that I can clean these thoroughly. These bottles can be completely separated to be washed and sterilized which affords me the piece of mind that harmful agents are not still lurking at the bottom of the bottle. They withstand steam sterilization well and heat nicely under hot tap water. I have washed them in the top rack of my dishwasher many times with no problems (which also sterilizes them as well). Stage one nipple may be slow, but manufacturer gives information how to safely enlarge nipple hole (hot needle inserted to slightly enlarge the hole).I have found that enlargement of the nipple hole was not necessary as I have encountered no problems of any kind with this bottle system."
2,Too hard to eat,"The one good thing about this bottle is that it does come out very slow so my baby never spit up, however it came out too slow. My baby would take an hour to eat and then fall asleep. I never saw any bubbles, but by the end of the feeding my baby and I were completely frustrated. I would recomment Dr. Brown's Bottles over these."
2,Nipples are horrible,"Like many other reviewers experienced, the first time our baby tryed these bottles, she sucked for 10 minutes and didn't get anything. We went back and looked at the instructions and found that you're supposed to massage the nipple, and the disc at the bottom of the bottle to make sure that both the nipple hole and vents in the disc are open and working... which they weren't straight out of the package. After that, she hasn't had any trouble getting milk from the bottles. Now the problem is that the shape of the nipple hole (kind of like a 3 pronged star) makes them very prone to tearing. So we've already had to throw away at least 7 nipples in the 4 weeks she's been regularly bottle-feeding, and that's only during the day when she's at daycare. I'll be switching to new bottles once we run out of nipples (won't be long at this rate!!), since that will certainly be cheaper in the long run than having to keep buying replacement nipples."
4,The only bottle I used,I like the bent neck but since I didn't use any other bottles I have nothing to compare it to.
4,My baby loves them,Although these bottles can be a pain to wash because all of the pieces they are the ones that my baby loves the best. The slow flow nipples are still the only ones that she will use at 4 months without choking. We take all the pieces apart and clean them in the dishwasher. We have a few leak but they usually weren't all the way dry yet or the bottom was screwed on way to tightly.
3,Bottles are great.....Nipples not so great,"I bought these bottles because it looked like they would lessen my daughter's air intake during feeding, and they did! My daughter burps and spits up much less, which makes the both of us much more happy! The actual bottles are wonderful, but the nipples they come with are impossible! I couldn't even get formula to come through the stage one nipples, let alone my two week old! The holes are not even there!I do agree with most people that the Ventair bottles are worth the money, because they do improve your feedings with your child, but I do suggest that you purchase different nipples with these bottles."
5,Hard for newborns,"On reviewer stated her newborn couldn't use the bottles well. I learned a trick for the problem when the baby is sucking but can't pull enough through Stage 1s. Cup your hand over the bottom of the bottle (the vent) and blow. The vents get clogged. You know if it loose if you can pinch the nipple and the milk streams out of the nipple. Pretty easy routine when checking the temperature. If it is clogged from formula settling, then milk won't stream out with a pinch test.My son loves these bottles, but started using them in combination with the Healthflow system when he was a newborn. Now that he is older he have a definite preference for the Vent-aire. He seems to burp less, likes the colors and doesn't spill or dripple as much formula. I would recommend these bottles, but be prepared if they have a hard time sucking, to use something like Healthflow for the first month."
5,GREAT BOTTLE,"The first time our daughter used this bottle we thought she was sick because she would suck for a little while and then cry. After about a half an hour of her gumming the nipple but not really drinking anything I tryed out the bottle myself to see if maybe it tasted funny. That's when I realized nothing was coming out. When you use new nipples for the Ventaire bottles you have to squeeze the tip a little bit to break it open. A friend of mine had a similar experience. Other than that we love them. I'm a new mom and it's the only bottle I've ever used. However, my daughter is almost 5 months old and she doesn't seem to be terribly gassy and she only seems to spit up when she eats too much or too fast which is usually my fault."
3,Ventaire Bottles,I used the playtex ventaire for my twin daughters until they were 2. They loved them. I have a few complaints- 1. If you do not put the silicone stopper in good enough-it will leak. 2. You should check your bottles nipples when u get them- one of my nipples had NO hole in it for the formula 2 come through. (...)
2,over rated,"didn't help with gas, a pain to clean and they leaked. The old fashioned plastic bottle with a plain nipple worked best for us."
2,not like mom,"I registered for these because they were from playtex, they reduce the air intake and they are easier to clean. When I opened them up I did see that they are easier to clean. The reason for my lack of satisfaction is the nipple. My child does not like these small skinny nipples. I was also nursing when he first came home and these nipples are definitely not like mom! I returned them and started using the Evenflo Ultra System. The evenflo nipples are much more like mom and the wide nipples from evenflo fit the Playtex disposable bottles. 2 stars for being easy to clean."
1,More of a hassle than mid-night tummy aches.,"I bought at least 3 dozen of these bottles before my second son was born. I soon learned that the bottles were a pain. First, my son could not get anything out of them, he would be crying to drink and very little formula would come out of these bottles/nipples. Finally I used them with a Gerber nipple and the problem was solved! Then the leaks began, if the bottles were not sealed perfectly (and sometimes when they were) they would leak. Then the cleaning issue. They come apart at the base for the vent and the rubber seal to be washed so it's extra little bottle parts and washing for Mommy. I would not reccomend these to anyone. I am pregnant with my third baby and will stick with Health Flow.!"
4,Good Bottles,"My son has been completely breast fed. When it was time to start trying bottles, we tried them all. Avent, Dr. Browns the playtex nurser even the Gerber contour. This bottle was the only one he doesn't play with. He can easily get his mouth all the way around the nipple and gets a good seal.I do agree that the stage one nipples are a little slow, and the stage 2 are too fast. I have modified the nipples myself so that they flow a little faster.Also the newer version is much easier to take the vent out of the bottom. We haven't had any clogging problems, but we separate it out everytime we clean the bottle.The only thing that is bad is that it is difficult to warm them, unless you are using a crock of water, because of the bottom.It is important for you to try different bottle to see which one works for you and your baby. I suggest buying one of each to see which one works, then buying more of the one that work"
5,Excellent buy,I used these with my first daughter as well as my second. They worked perfectly and I have no complaints. Well worth the price and lives up to all the labeling promises. Very pleased.
3,it`s ok,its ok i dont prefer them to tommie tip bottles but good for the price. wouldnt recommend to friends. i feel they are hard to use and too many extra pieces to put together and wash.
3,"It does the job, but it's not miraculous","I had been hearing how my new nephew was sick with colic, and I thought I'd try to be a hero and get them some of these, cause it says it reduces colic. Only I found out they had been using these all along. So, you shouldn't get these hoping for miracles.But, at least the design is sound. Have you ever sucked the air from a soda bottle, then felt the coke rushing into your mouth afterward? That's what a baby must feel after sucking on a regular bottle all day. This new design the air to flow out the bottom end, without spilling milk, and that results in a comfortable flow of milk for the baby. So, that's a good thing.It's a good product, but I gotta wonder what took us so long? It seems like a obvious idea. You're going to need baby bottles, they may as well be these."
2,unhappy mama,"We went with the playtex brand of bottles when my daughter was born without issue. It's what made me go back when my son was weaned 1 week ago.The bottles have changed dramatically in just 1 1/2 years. First, the nipple is narrow all the way to the bottle allowing too much to go in his mouth- gagging. Second, in a pack of 3, all were fast flow and I mean fast. He drank to much at a time while struggling to breathe until the poor thing threw up. My instinct told me to go with the brand with high reviews while my previous experience convinced me to go with familiarity. Complete waste of money. I'd hoped he'd pick up the pace and learn eventually with the first try but I just can't bring myself to do that to him again."
3,Seems like a mixed bag...,"The bottle's shape is perfect for feeding, but the nipples are smallish. Definitely this bottle is only good for smaller babies and not ones who could rip the nipples off of it. The design of the bottle is great and gives parents an excellent way to supposedly vent out the air that is typical of most bottles leading to spit-ups. But even that claim is suspect since bubbles still end up in the baby. Great concept...poor execution."
3,it is a big fuss,at 1 am who has time to mess with putting it together? my baby is on formula and it takes her 10 min to drink it. and it doesn't help take out the bubbles
4,The Ventaire Bottles,"My child, Kiersten, is only three weeks old. She can drink from a bottle with my hands' support and we used to use Playtex bottles, but they were too complicated, so we gave up. However, my 14-month-old son, Jayeson, prefers to keep his Playtex Sippy Cups. Kiersten likes these bottles much better and it's easy for me to feed her. I also give Jayeson a sippy cup to keep him busy."
1,hard to clean,"We tried these bottles at the advice of a friend. My baby didn't like them, and I think its a lot of work to get them cleaned properly. We are sticking with the Avent system. Easy to fill, clean, and baby loves them!"
1,Playtex Ventaire Bottles are NOT Bisphenol -A Free,"Playtex Ventaire Bottles are NOT Bisphenol-A Free. The Playtex Bottles with the liners are considered ok! I was recently informed about the use of Bisphenol -A in some brands of Baby Bottles, After re-searching Bisphenol -A, I discovered that exposing my baby to harmful chemicals with the potential for long term affects later in life, was definitely not for me!! There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. The Playtex Bottles with the liners are said to be ok, though the hard plastic shell of the bottle is made using Bisphenol-A, the plastic liner that touches the baby's milk is not! Do your own research. I'm really surprised that the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated."
1,MY DAUGHTER HATES THESE BOTTLES,"I wanted an alternative to the liner bottles because of the extra cost the liners incur. A man in the isle at walmart told me to try the vent-air bottles. I bought some, tried them, and what a waste of money. My daughter hates them! I thought it was the nipple so I changed to the brown playtex nipple. It collopsed and I constantly had to stop and let it get back in shape. Then I tried the clear nipples but for some reason she just doesnt like them. She chews them and cant latch on properly. So I gave up and I'm still looking for a solution to my problem. She's a little older now so gas isnt a huge issue anymore. I just need a bottle that can be used with the brown nipple but doesnt require the liner. why cant playtex make one of those!!!!!!"
1,can anyone say puke...my daughter did,I bought many versions of this bottle. All brands because my daughter puked a lot. The doc said it wasn't reflux so we tried EVERY bottle out there. The best ones are the Platex with the drop ins. The angled bottles are TERRIBLE. They are a pain to get the air out of and it's a pain to use since you SUPPOSE to fill it from the bottom. I WILL STICK WITH THE DROP INS.
2,Good bottles but fog up like a m fer when boiled,These bottles work fine but i prefer glass to any plastic bottle because of the fogging in the plastic and funny smells. These bottles fogged up horribly bad and I no longer use them because I can whipe the fog off somewhat with my finger so god only knows what is going into ur baby.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"These are expensive and very difficult to assemble. If you execute the procedure like a rocket scientist, they will leak. If they don't leak, the milk won't come out of the nipple. I tried them once and my baby surely thought I was crazy. Anyway, use the regular playtex bottles."
2,They Leak !!,"I'm a mother of twin nine month old girls. I chose these bottles for the design, no bubbles. I got over all of the parts you need to clean and what not. But then to find out they leak after about 5 to 6 months of use it is just wrong. I followed the instructions on care and cleaning and no where does it mention leaking or having to replace parts. I found out about the replacement parts after calling Playtex. I was told the replacement silcone is only .50 cents. I told customer service cost is not the point. I want a reliable product. If I had known in advance they would leak and I would need to call and order replacement parts I would have never purchased this product. I believe Playtex should put in their instructions replace of parts is needed. Then the choice is yours."
2,"Faulty Nipples, and over time Bottle starts to leak...","We used the VentAire bottles with Baby #1 we had a wonderful experience. We used this Platex bottle for Baby #2 we did not have problems with gas, its just that we have had problems with the bottle.First, it seems that one out of 2 packs would have faulty nipples. Meaning, the nipples did not have a hole in the top for the milk to exit.Secondly, we have been using the bottle for 9 months and the bottles are starting to leak. Therefore, we are having to purchase new bottles.Yes, they prevent gas, but you pay for it over time with the faulty nipples and leaking bottles. My recommendation is keep your reciept and have lots of spare bottles on hand."
2,Playtex user,"I recieved the ventaire as a shower gift, I hadn't registered for them but I decided to give it a try. My daughter hated them because it took so long to get anything out of them. If you love washing bottles this would be the product to buy.After three days I switched back to Playtex disposables (the original kind) which my daughter had her first bottle feeding without being frustrated.I know alot of people buy this product because of they think that if their children have this bottle they won't have ""GAS"" and or ""EAR INFECTIONS"" but really the kind of bottle they really want is the disposables its alot more sanitary.The angled bottles also can give you a cramp if you hold them in a certain way.I forgot another weird one Ive heard is that it takes away colicThe kind of bottle their looking for is the Avent bottle which has run studies on that subject not the angled bottles."
1,waste of money,"These bottles are impossible. We spent so much money on purchasing numerous VentAire bottles in various sizes. After just 10 days, we could no longer take the leaking bottoms and need to let air in, so that our daughter could get anything out. We gave them to charity and had to purchase an entire new line of bottles- Avent, MUCH BETTER!!!!"
2,I have used better bottles,I purchased these before my baby was born. Well they are OK to use but they always leak and since I had to bottle feed my baby these bottle gave him even more gas.
3,bad nipples and a pain to clean,"The new born nipples give no formula at all. We had to poke everyone and it still was not right. To clean these you have to take the whole bottom apart everytime. Way too much of a price for these bottles. You are better off buying the evevflo new born set. These worked great and we had no problems with gas, ear aches or the nipple flow."
3,I loved them before..but not so much anymore,"When I had my first child, I bought these and loved them! I had got them because basic bottles always had a vacuum seal, and he didn't drink so well since the milk couldn't flow through a collapsing nipple. I never had any problems with them. They worked fantastically. I packed them up, knowing we were going to have another baby someday. Well, I now have a 5 month old daughter and they aren't working so well for her. I bought a couple of newer ones for her, but even those are having problems. The bottles have begun to leak out of the bottom where the ventilation system is. It was a huge letdown because they worked so great before. It's a great concept, but the design is a bit flawed."
4,"Good Bottles, Dr. Brown's Better","I tried these bottles before Dr. Brown's to try to cut down on the amount of air my son was taking in. They did seem to help a lot with his gas, and are much easier to clean than Dr. Brown's. I experienced no leaking with these, and my son seemed fine with using them. The only issue I had was with the nipples collapsing during the feeding. I don't know why, but the nipples just seem flimsier than Dr. Brown's and my son often had to stop eating because they would collapse.These are easy to wash, easy to assemble, and the curved design is very convienient. Other than the nipples, they were fine."
2,Not a fan,"I'm actually not a fan of these bottles, but for me, the problem lies moreso with the nipple. My son spent half his energy trying to suck the formula out of them. Even after going up a size, it didn't seem to make a difference. I gave up after a few feedings. Also, when he did manage to actually eat, he would still get fussy and gassy- an issue these bottles claim to reduce. In my opinion, there are better bottle options out there."
5,Nothing else would work...,"I have a six month old and when he was born, he had acid reflux, so bad that he was put on Zantac at 2 weeks old. We tried every kind of bottle we saw and this was the only one that he would take, nothing else would work! I like them because they are easy to clean and reduced the amount of air he swallowed. That meant less spitting up for us. Now he is 6 months and he has outgrown his reflux but not his bottle. I would not trade them for anything! I think they are fabulous!"
4,Do reduce burping but is it necessary?,"I actually like these bottles and we use these for formula and avent for breastmilk, just out of habit. I think there is a little less burping after using these, but the extra parts to clean when you take the bottom off can be a nuisance. We have never had leakage problems."
2,Sticking with the cheap bottles,"I received these bottles at my baby shower. I had them on my registery because I heard alot of good things about them. But when I starting using them, my baby didn't like them. She actually gets gassier with these bottles than the cheap bottles I'm using now. I guess all babies are different. I suggest purchaseing just one of these bottles before buying a whole kit, just to test it out."
3,Either way...,"I used these bottles when my 4 year old was an infant. And I have to say that half the time they were good, and the other half they were horrible. Half the time they would leak, and the other times they were fine.I'm sure all bottles leak at some point. But I agree with the other review. Everyone has gas....especially babies. I'd rather stick to a simple easy to use bottle, then one that may or may not leak depending on how I put it together.I think I'm going with regular bottles, without all the fancy technology..."
4,This product saved my sanity!,"My son is a poor latcher and had problems breastfeeding and problems with the avent bottles (which are great products, by the way). I switched to these yesterday out of desperation and can't imagine why I waited 7 weeks to try! These are perfect for nibblers and gourmet eaters who eat slow. It has almost completely eliminated the gas and spit-up problems were were having with the #1 & #2 nipples by avent. The 6oz. size is much more convient than the 4oz size that others come in. My son only used 4 oz sized bottles for 3 weeks! The only problens I see is they aren't supposed to be sterilized in a steam sterilizer or used in an electric bottle warmer. I run mine in the dishwasher and heat the formula in my 9oz avent bottles using my bottle warmer and pour it into the playtex ones. They also only have 2-4-6 oz markings on the bottle so it's a little harder to see how much has been eaten. Great bottles at a breat price (and the nipples are cheap to replace!)"
1,I HATE THEM!!!!,"When I first saw them at the store I thought... nah, they look like they leak. So I bought elite from evenflo. Well my dear mother in law arrived to visit us one day with 7 of these bottles, so to be polite I sterilized one and used it. My daughter hated it because she was used to the wide nipple and I hated it myself because the bottom wouldn't stop leaking. Plus, the nipple collapsed. Can't store made formula in them, can't use them with a bottle warmer, and so on.I wonder if the bottles were tested at all."
2,not happy with the bottles,"I recieved the bottles for my shower and when my daughter arrived I found myself spending a lot of time cleaning all the parts that went with the bottles. I also didn't like that the ounces only went 2,4,6 which made it difficult to make up bottles requiring ounces in between. I went to the avent bottles and are much happier"
5,HAPPY BABY,"I WOULD LIKE TO THANK PLAYTEX FOR COMING OUT WITH THE VENTAIRE BOTTLE.I FED MY BABY WITH OTHER BOTTLES AND HE CONTINUOSLY CRIED, HE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME WITH GAS IN HIS STOMACH THAT WOULD NOT COME OUT. WHEN IT DID COME OUT IT ALMOST SOUNDED PAINFUL.NOW THAT HE IS USING THE VENTAIRE BOTTLE, HE DOESN'T CRY THE WAY HE USE TO, WHICH WAS CONSTANTLY, HE ISN'T AS FUSSY, HE SLEEPS MORE AND MOST IMPORTANT HE IS A MUCH HAPPIER BABY. I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH."
1,TOO MANY PIECES!,I had purchased these bottles for my newborn son. I thought they would work well with the angled shape to them and with the ventair system that they have. BUT THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY PIECES TO THEM!!! Considering I also have a dishwasher to clean and sanitze them...these were way too frustrating to deal with. You need patience to clean and assemble these and even once you have that down to a science ( because you have to make sure that the discs are put in completely correct or they will leak!!)....You cant use them in the bottle warmer (because they will leak)!!!I immediately had to run out and get a whole new type of bottle system. These bottles overall just made my life more difficult...especially with a crying baby at all hours!!!
3,"This is OK, but I like my Playtex Nursers better","I registered for these bottles on the recommendation of a friend. We had a bonus baby. These bottles have 5 pieces to seperate and clean. With my 5 and 7 year old we used the playtex nurser with the disposable bottles. Luckily I found replacement nipples since I now use my old ones more. These bottles are OK, but the nipple confused my baby. I found it was easier for him to go from bottle to breast using the disposable. Plus Playtex now makes a breast pump attachment, so you can pump right into the liners.My recommendation is to go with the old fashion playtex nurser, not this new style."
1,A Potential Hazard,"I purchased this item and had to mail it back to Playtex for a refund. These bottles only wasted formula and proved to be a potential hazard to my infant. I found that when I made her bottles, formula would leak out of the bottom of one of the bottles. What really was the last straw was when I burned myself heating up a bottle. The boiling water gets trapped in between the bottle and vent. When I took it out to test the formula, the trapped water spilled out on my arm. I was outraged to think that this water could have leaked out on my baby as I was feeding her. I would caution any parent when using this item. I just decided that this product was not for my child and I."
3,Leak Problems,"Well I will have to say that I really did like these bottles until they started leaking. My son drank very well out of these bottles. Then one day I had one of them just start to leak, out of all of my VentAire, Iv'e thrown away 4. Thats crazy to have 4 crack and leak. Otherwise if they didn't leak and crack so easily, I would have to say it's an allright bottle."
1,not happy,"We just recently had our 3rd child. We used the J & J Healthflow bottles for the 1st 2. Was sad to see they have discontinued these. We bought the Ventaire bottles and have not been happy with them at all. The stage 1 nipples are way too slow. our baby couldn't get anything out. It took almost an hour to feed him 3 ounces! We went to the stage 2 and it's way too fast! He's only 3 weeks old so the stage 1 is really what he needs, but with these nipples they just don't work."
2,dont buy these bottles,I bought this bottle and loved it my one week old seems to love the nipple the only thing is the bottles are all leaking out the bottom so they are useless I am writing the company to see why they are leaking.I have only been using them a week and they are already broke so dont waste your money.
2,Unreliable,"This book has only one good thing: it gives original texts in hieroglyphics from various periods of Egypt. But, many scholars have found that Budge's system is outdated and unreliable. So, if you can't decipher hieroglyphics, I wouldn't reccomend buying this book. Most of all, he doesn't even give translations for all the texts! He gives 8 out of the 20 scripts in english. Heck, the guy's been dead for 100 years, and we've made new discoveries in deciphering Ancient Egyptian. There are many other authors on hieroglyphics that are much more accurate in their translations. Don't be like me and waste your money on this horrible book."
5,For grounding and elevating the soul,"Dulcet Anglican chant seeps into the soul, calming, soothing, stabilizing, grounding. Any and every one of the 12 discs that compose ""The Psalms of David,"" as recorded by the Choir of St Paul's Cathedral, London, directed by John Scott, is worth having. Superb for meditation or as perpetual ambiance, these discs, with their mellifluous melodies, enhance the atmosphere. Whether driving or at home or in my classroom, I almost always have one of these discs playing to keep my soul grounded."
4,a hot potatoe for any guitarist who wants some action!!,"Paul Lidel has not failed to amaze on this wonderfull effort which i think has been hugely successfull on demystifying scales(and using them). Very few books concentrate on both these aspects of learning scales and paul has been really touchy on getting things across n a simple, lucid manner... a must for every lead guitarist (beginner\intermediate\advanced). believe me...it makes a difference with this book....it did to me...."
5,This was another excellent book written by DENNIS HUNT.,"I just read Goose hunting. Improving your skills and found it to be an excellent book and now, I read this book and find it to be just as good. This book really teaches you how to hunt geese. It tells you what to do and what not to do. He makes a fool out of me with my stupid BALE BLIND and using those TEXAS RAGS. No wonder I havn't been killing any geese but, killing a lot of time. I have a lot more confidence now and know that I will improve."
5,The book was spectacular!,"The story, the pictures, the illustrations and the good information all made me a lot better goose hunter."
2,Whodunit? Who cares?,"A very minor entry in an otherwise pleasant series. Two mysteries (one old, one new), neither particularly interesting. And neither one solved by Meredith or Markby! What gives?"
3,I MUST BE TOO OLD FOR THIS,"I must be too old for this novel, I really hated it! The writing was sloppy, the people that live in these pages, just didn't touch me like they did others. i was very surprised. I'm in my 30's and I read as much gay fiction as I can and most of it I love, but this just didn't grab me like the Front Runner. I am really surprised by how many people said this was ""moving"" and ""touching"". Sorry I just don't see it. I must be getting old.If your in your 30's or older skip it. If your a teen or 20's read it, If your a jock you might get it. I found that wrestling stuff BOOOORING! More story less erotic fantasies of under age kids rolling around feeling eacother up! I think I made my point. For a younger group not adults."
2,"A refreshing start, but decends into triteness","The protagonist, a highschool wrestler, lives the normal life of a teenager - except that he is gay, and comfortable with who he is. However, by midpoint in the book, the author begins to insert all the stereotypical dramas that seem to infest books of this genre. It's almost like the author felt he has to pay hommage to the gay mafia and make sure he has included all the standard ""talking points"" in order for his work to be accepted. Too bad - it almost ruins the story."
4,Pinned. First paragraph!,"Author had me 'pinned' from the first paragraph.Great writing. Great ""coming of age"" story.Story was a bit slow in places, but always kept my interest.It brought back many memories of my own high-school years."
2,Great for someone else.,"I jumped at the idea of buying this book because I wanted to get tips for planning my New York based- Latino wedding.Clearly for someone like me who is from a Latino/Caribbean country it was not particularly helpful. Most of the book focused on what I characterize as more Mexican traditions. I can't really say that any of the vendors or sites that they suggest are good ones for New Yorkers or those of us that live in the Northeast. I'd love to find a book that focused more on Cuban, Dominican or Puerto Rican wedding traditions. I guess I'll have to keep searching."
2,Not much different from any other wedding book,"Although this book is supposed to be helpful guide, the author manages to group most Latinos into one large culture to discuss. As another reviewer states, when the author is not writing about Latinos in general, she seems to know and write more about Mexican culture. I am looking for a guide that would help me plan a wedding with Cuban traditions, and though this book is not insightful in that area, I did find the section on how to format an invitation in the traditional ""Y"" layout helpful. If I had seen this in a bookstore, I would have not bought it and only taken notes on the invitation area. I would not recommend this book, yet unfortunately, it is the only book I know of that makes an effort to write about Latino weddings."
2,"one great song, three mediocre","Burning Hearts is a great song. The other three are pretty forgettable. Except for the male vocalist's over-affectation of an accent on the second song, which is pretty laughable. If he's not doing it on purpose, that's even worse."
3,Fate's Finger,Overall I enjoyed reading this book. The BIG drawback was all the typos which I found to be highly distracting. The publisher really needs to consider re-printing after a proofreader has made corrections.
3,shallow,"Schneider knows his Adirondacks in a superficial way, and after reading his book, so will you. If the topic intrests you, pick up a copy of CONTESTED TERRAIN by Philip Terrie. Contested Terain is as sound as The Adirondacks is shallow. Style, of course is a matter of taste. Many people appear to enjoy Schneider's carefully studied casual prose."
5,DVD ?????????!,"Why is this excellent, highly entertaining, wonderful adaptation of a celebrated novel with none other than Christian Bale now of ""The Machinist"" fame and Charleston Hesston (""The President's Lady"", ""Secret of the Incas"" ""Solar Crisis""), Oliver Reed (""Gladiator"") and Sir Christopher Lee (in celebrated roles as ""Dracula"", ""Saruman"" ""Darth Vader"", ""Zazzerdrone"") not on DVD.Can somebody tell me please? Anybody? I loved this TV presentation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. I'd like to see it again. Too bad I threw out my ole VHS player. Or donated to Goodwill who then threw it out, along with most of their VHS tapes cause nobody watches movies on that anymore.C'mon get with the program. They change mediums all the time to keep us constantly having to buy new copies of stuff we already owned! And I'm feeling pressure to ""upgrade"" to Blue Laser format now or whatever ya call it. Booo"
3,Revision,"Not received as advertised. Please accept my sincerest apologies that the item I sold you was not as described. Short of opening the shrink wrap I had no way to know the item was not sealed by the manufacturer. Just like you, I purchased this item believing it was new and paid for it as such. I in no way meant to mislead anyone. In fact if you look at my other listings you will see that I describe every flaw to the best of my knowledge."
1,Video Treasure Island,I played the VHS movie Treasure Island once and the tape was crinkled and wouldn't play. I feel like I waisted my money. It was for a classroom project and I was unable to finish that portion of the unit. I am not pleased. It was a faulty product.
2,Treasure Island w/ Charlton Heston,"When I buy a movie rated G, I expect to get one the whole family can enjoy. I was also looking forward to seeing Charlton Heston in his role as Long John Silver. I began watching the movie with my 2- and 5-year old children, and as the movie progressed, I was disappointed. The movie has quite a bit of profanity, and although some degree of violence is expected, I found it too prevalent and too graphic for a G rated movie."
5,Treasure Island - best production,"This is the best performance of this story that I have ever seen.They got EVERYTHING right: acting, cinematography, music (awesome score from the Chieftans)....I remain completely mystified as to why this prodcution is not available on DVD!!!"
4,closing the loops,"My co-author Denis Bridoux recommended me to read all of David Zindells books. He considers them as a resource for helping people to think beyond their boundaries, and I agree with him.This book picks up where the third of David Zindell's books left the reader. However, there is no need to have read previous books: since the author will recapitulate what you read in the previous 3 ones. As refreshing as the first books were, for me, this one was rather ""more of the same"". Of course, given the quality of the previous books, that's still a compliment. So, I enjoyed reading it, being on holiday, but I didn't find any new messages that may help the reader to break through it's own thinking (as Zindell's previous books did)...."
4,...and they all lived happily ever after?,"Zindell writes beautifully and deeply. He ranges across technology, religion, philosopy and the human condition. His books are excellent. This is SF at its best. Why not 5 stars, then? There are two things that detract from this book. Firstly, there are two or three occasion when I want to throw the book across the room (which I don't) and scream ""just get on with the story"" (which I do, much to the consternation of the others in the room): Zindell has a tendancy to go overboard on the detailed philosophising. Secondly, there is the ending. The baddies are killed, the goodies survive (with the obvious exceptions), the future looks bright and rosy. Given the darkness permeating the rest of the series, this ""happily ever after"" scenario jars. So only 4 stars. But I wouldn't have missed reading it."
1,buyer beware,"I'll preface this with the fact that I have not read this book in its entirety. Please - read a few random pages from the web. I was surprised at some pages I read. The author sounds of an enraged ex-husband with some not so good advice on handling anger. Just my opinion. To each his own, but take a look before you put your money out there."
5,Friendships Are Relationships,"I found Drs. Gutstein and Sheely's new book very helpful for implementing the Relationship Development Intervention curriculum for our son who has Asperger's.The Activities were presented in a very user friendly format in a step-by-step manner. The corresponding Objectives were clearly stated, and it will be easy to monitor his progress. I know that these objectives will be beneficial when planning for his IEP at school next year.I've always wished that our son came with a manual....well now I've got one. Thanks."
3,Just Ok,"This is a huge, fluffy towel so it is kind of difficult for it to not be able to absorb anything. But overall, it could be a lot more efficient considering it's marketed as ultra absorbent"
1,heavy but not absorbant,These towels are thick and heavy but are not at all absorbant. Using them feels like rubbing yourself with a piece of carpeting. The design seems more about appearance than practicality. Not recommended.
3,It's a towel.,"How do you review a towel? Does it dry me off? Check. Does it dry me off without peeling off my skin? Check. It takes a couple of washings to get it to act more like a towel than a squeegie, but that goes for almost all cloth these days. I found it on sale - I think. Can't remember. It's a towel. No, you're a towel. Wait..what?"
4,"Pem America Resort Bath Towel, Mauve",Very good quality for the price. Could not find comprable quality or price in store.
2,Book...,"I would have probably been happy, but i recieved the wrong book. They were very prompt in the return of my money and felt really bad with what happened. I got a book from school it is a very good and well put together book!"
5,Better quality than expected,i didn't expect the banner to be this nice and was pleasantly surprised. it's a stitched banner that enhances my sports room perfectly. Geaux Saints!!!
5,Well researched book on the psychology of eating,"Although not a ""diet"" book per se this is the best in that category. Rather than provide the right way to eat, it demonstrates through extensive research that body weight is the result of a complex interplay of biological and behavioral factors. The authors first seek to teach self-acceptance, then the rational-emotive/cognitive behavioral methods to maximize self-regulation. The case vignettes presented throughout the book both add to its entertainment value and its applicability"
5,Dr. Abrams is the man!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was lucky enough to take an Abnormal psychology class with Dr. Abrams. He is a strong believer in REBT. I was also fortunate to be given this book as a gift. Being the know-it-all that I am when it comes to fitness, i was hesitant to read this book. The authors do an excellant job in something that no fitness book(at least that I have read) has done before, and that is tackle the mental aspect of long-term fitness and health. I found the book very helpful in helping me to change my irrational thinking. I strongly urge anyone on the quest to look and feel better about themselves to pick up this book."
3,GOOD VITAMIN TO TAKE BUT MAKES ME SICK!,"These vitamins are good, they have changed my hair and nails for the better. I also have noticed a big difference in my energy level and menstral cycle. The only thing I dont like is that I absolutely have to take this on a completely FULL stomach. I would never be dumb enough to take on an empty stomach, but even when I take after a small meal I will feel sick. Its crucial I eat a big full-filling meal first. I have experienced nausea so bad that Ive actually thrown up after taking this. I have even gotten diarrhea before because i took this with only a small breakfast. Very important how you take it. Other than that my only concern is why in the world would anyone pay $30 for these vitamins online?? You can get them at the grocery store for like $6 bucks! Just something to think about..."
2,"Multi-vitamins are good, stomach pains are not so good","I am glad that One-A-Day has created multi-vitamins specifically targeting women but honestly, I do not feel a big difference between taking these multi-vitamins versus not taking them. Perhaps the effects are more passive and minute, but then again I don't think anyone is waiting for an energy drink effect from taking the vitamins to begin with.There is one thing that I have to advise though, DO NOT, never ever, take these vitamins with an empty stomach! Please take after a meal. The effects of the pills on your stomach is extremely painful. It makes my stomach feel sick and also induces the feeling of puking. It took me a long time to figure out that One-A-Day caused this.I believe in taking multi-vitamins to complete an active and healthy lifestyle, but I don't want to be fearing a sick stomach to get there."
1,expire soon,"I brought 2 bottles on May, however after I got it I found that they will expire on August. I can't eat them all before the expiration."
3,Felt dizzy & wierd!,"I decided that I needed to take these vitamins for the added benefits of calcium & iron. After taking just one pill, I got extremely dizzy! I mean, like I had to lie down dizzy. It was wierd. I thought perhaps it was something else going on or something I ate. Well, after taking another one the next day, BAM! I got really dizzy and wierd feeling again AND had to run to the bathroom! So, I know it has to be this vitamin. I won't take them anymore and I am returning them. Very strange, as I have never had a vitamin do that to me before!"
1,PRICE IS RIDICULOUS,This vitamin deserves 5 stars. I love this vitamin & have been taking it for 2 years. This price barely deserves one star! Its cheaper to order from another site.
1,Get sick everytime I take this,"Something must have changed because I've been getting sick. At first, I thought it was because I've taken it on an empty stomach. Then, I had breakfast (a full breakfast) and took the pill within 1 hour. 45 minutes later, I felt nauseous and wanted to throw up. It repeated for two more days until I decided that I will not take this vitamin at all."
3,Not for me....,"You really can't go wrong with a multi vitamin. But for me with this multi vitamin, I have to eat much more then I normally would at breakfast to keep it down. For breakfast I will usually have a regular size bowl of cereal, or yogurt mixed with fruit or sometimes a piece of fruit with toast. But to keep this down I would have to eat a regular size bowl of cereal and two pieces of toast. That's much to filling for me to eat for breakfast. Mainly because I don't have much of an appetite in the morning, but eat to get my metabolism going!I would find myself taking them later in the day after lunch and because of the caffeine (that states it's equal to one cup of coffee) it was too much for me that late in the day and would keep me up at night. Though I believe there is a version with no caffeine. So I switched to taking B complex with vitamin C, along with a kelp, and flaxseed supplement(to improve skin). It gives me the effect I need without being too heavy on my stomach."
1,Headaches everyday,"I took a full bottle of this for almost a year without realizing I had a headache from them day in and day out. I thought it could have been caffeine, my hormones, sleep deprivation, etc. The day I finally ran out of these vitamins is the day I stopped having headaches. Terrible vitamins. I will never take them again."
5,ATTENTION COLD SORE SUFFERERS!,"I had been suffering from cold sores for years before starting One-a-day Women's 2 years ago and I haven't had a cold sore since! None of my usual triggers (stress, time of the month, illnesses, etc.) have changed over the same time frame. I solely attribute my lack of cold sores to One-a-day Women's!"
1,Not recommended,I bought these for my college aged daughter but she gave them back because they made her throw up several times. I didn't believe the vitamins had caused the sickness so I started taking them myself. The first couple of days were fine and I didn't think any more about it but then I started feeling intense nausea in the mornings. I read these reviews and found others had had the same problem. Luckily the sensation passes off in 10 minutes or so but I have never experienced this with vitamins before and wonder what they put in them.
2,It made me sick,"I have never taken a multi vitamin before. I took these vitamins three times and all three times they made me feel nautious and gave me a stomachache. Having said that, I took them while I was snacking, so perhaps if I take them after a full meal I will get better results. I am considering trying Centrum."
2,Great Vitamins and amazing benefits when you aren't throwing up,"Complete Update: so I've been using one a day for over a month now, initially I was happy. I had no sickness and I could see the benefits within a week of using it. All of a sudden, every time I take the pill, I throw up. Especially if i haven't eaten, that is the worst feeling...Even if i've eaten, within 10 minutes it comes right back up. So I've ditched these pills now, I'm on the hunt for something that doesn't disagree with my stomach."
3,Weird smell & taste...,I wanted to get a multi-vitamin as I knew I was lacking some essential vitamins in my daily diet.It might be good for your body but it sure tastes & smells unusual. I have to force myself to take it everyday though; and try to blank out the unpleasantness.
2,Got sick and dizzy from taking,"I was very concerned about starting taking a multivitamin because they aren't regulated by the FDA, but I found out that the ""one-a-day"" company submitted its product for voluntary review to ConsumerLab and USP, and passed both tests for product purity and safety. So...I ignored that people said it made them sick, because I assumed that you just needed to take it with food (in fact, their website recommends taking it AFTER a meal). But, even with that in mind, it STILL made me feel nauseous and dizzy. I'd never felt so horrible in my life - I felt like I had the flu every time I took this pill. Like other reviewers, I do NOT have a weak stomach - spicy or bitter foods don't bother me. I think I'm going to try one-a-day's powdered drink instead - since it doesn't say to take it with food (so I am assuming it doesn't make you sick). stay tuned...."
3,"Energy Drinks, Vitamins, Nausea-Oh My!","I don't have any health problems.I drink Rockstar, Monsters, Redbull with no problem.I also can take vitamin B (in any form) without hesitation or fear of too much energy.I don't eat a lot of junk food.I drink coffee.It takes a lot to make me throw up or nauseous.But....This pill makes me want to barf. I feel sick on it. I can't eat anything. If I were a person without an iron stomach (as you can see from what I usually consume), I believe that I would have thrown up by now.Why, Why! Do I keep taking it?It helps me concentrate and I certainly don't feel hungry when I feel like barfing.So I guess it does what it says!"
4,One a Day women's multi vitamin 250 tablets,I spent this in half between my mother and me. We arebplanning on doing this again. This was a great bye.
3,Great to good,I brought item a few month ago and loved it so I decided to the monthly shipping since I enjoyed it so. However the second order shipped I found not to be as strong and flavorful. I haven't finish the entire box which contains 100 tea bags. I hope it gets better.
3,A fair mint tea,"I rate this as a decent mint tea, although it doesn't stand out among the crowd. I like the way the teabags are made. And I prefer the organic."
3,Too strong a scent for my taste,"I complimented a friend of mine because FRACAS smelled great on her. Yet when I bought myself a bottle, the thing I noticed about this scent was the strong odor of gardenias, which I didn't notice on my friend at all. I will say that does deplete a bit after awhile (thank goodness) but this perfume has never smelled as nice on me, (or to me) as it did on my friend!! One tiny spritz is enough; it would definitely overpower anyone around you if you wore too much."
4,Beautiful & Classic,"Fracas is a beautiful white floral, dominated by tuberose. It's a classic scent that's quite feminine. A perfume for a pretty spring dress.If you like the impression of this scent but not the price, try Sand & Sable by Coty which can be found at estate sales & resale shops. Another similar fragrance is Kim Kardashian. With dominant tuberose notes, I find each of these remarkably similar to Fracas at a fraction of the price."
2,"Too many words, not enough substance.","Ben Bova has been known for writing very long books. This one is no exception.It took Mr. Bova almost the entire book to make it interesting. And the end was as dull and slow as the beginning. If I could, I would use more adjectives to discuss my dislike for this book; however, to do so would be akin to Mr. Bova's drawn-on language.I understand there are more books in The Voyager series and I cannot wait, not to read them. Woe be to those that would buy them or even try to read them."
1,This is suppose to help with the Accelerated exam,Microsoft has written over 1600 pages of material that is written for newbies not MCSE's. MCSE's for the most part do not need to review what is WINS or DNS ect ect. This material should have been condenced for the accelerated exam.
2,A bad book,This book didn't do a good job on preparing me for the accelerated exam. I had many questions on subjects not covered in it. I would suggest getting one book for each exam covered and study them all or forget this exam altogether and take the four individual exams. MS Press messed up on this one.
1,Not good study material,"This would be great for a desk reference, however it is not designed to be a study aid for the certification exam(s). If you are looking to pass the Win2k exams go with something more specific and condenced. Exam Prep or Sybex."
1,Not this one,"This book is cramed with info such as what is DHCP and DNS! Why would anyone taking the accelerated exam want to read all the same things over and over again. It seems you have to read for days just to get the smallest bit of new information. You could learn faster and more reading the help files on a Windows 2000 server box. Save some time buy a real accelerated or cram book, or even taking all four exams would be faster than reading all this."
4,Is it complete for MCSE Accelerated Exam?,"I'd like to know this book is complete reference for MCSE Accelerated Exam Coures. If not so, which books I should refer more."
4,Passed 70-240 w/This Book as Primary Tool,"I passed 70-240 last week in 3.5+ hours. It was the toughest MS test I have taken yet but it is definately passable. 70-240 is made up of 4 separate tests; Pro, Server, AD, NetInf and this book is broken up in that manner to help you pass. It's 1400 pages of Chapters and you need every page! This book is the most comprehensive I saw and WILL, if read and studied, guarentee you pass. I would not use this exclusivley - I read some Technet articles and stuff, but that was all free. This is all you have to pay for to pass 70-240."
4,Understand most of materials and you will pass.,"Yes, if you understand most of the materials and you will pass. This is my first MS book that I read. I studied it for 2 month and I just passed the 240. Of course, there is 4-5 questions that are not covered by this book. If you are NT MCSE you should be able to answer those question. Even if you can't, you should still pass cuz there are about 100 questions and getting 6-7 wrong answers won't fail you. This is the only book I used for the that exam. As far as hand on goes, I setup Multi sites/Multi domain AD and E2k for my company.I give this book 4 stars not 5 because this book is too thick."
2,Informative But...,"This book contains a lot of information about important topics such as DNS and security. However, similar to other Microsoft Press books, it is written in a extremely dry way, and it is not an enjoyable read at all. You may learn something from reading this book if you can stay awake."
1,Disappointed,"Product was identical to a previous cork popper I was given only difference is that the previous one functioned. From the very start I was unable to open any bottles of wine, tried on several with same results. Do not reccomend."
2,Does not work as well as expected,"You can only open bottles with corks made of natural cork. This thing cannot open any other type, no matter how much you pump. Even for natural cork, it takes lots of pumping to actually see the cork move. Dissatisfied."
3,"Great lawyer, okay book.","Law students who have just taken a course in professional repsonsibility may characterize Joe Jamail as a bad man, as unscrupulouas, as a jerk. That is probably true. But, argumentum ad hominem. Just because the man is bad, his work may not be. The facts are that Jamail is one of the most successful American lawyers of all time; that he fights a tremendous fight for his clients. Read this book for what it is, an account of an outstanding lawyer and his interesting cases; not as an intro to legal ethics."
4,"Great, quick read...entertaining","Joe's account of his life is told in the great prose of a trial lawyer. I really liked this book, if you want a look into this ""larger than life"" man, buy it. You pay!"
1,Jamail is a jerk,Joe Jamail's book is a microcosm of his superiority complex. He thinks he is above the little man and this book reeks of his own feelings of self-importance. Why anyone would want to read this piece of garbage is beyond me.
4,Best children's introduction to prehistory I have found,"My daughter and I have just finished reading a lot of introduction to prehistory books. This was, by far, my favorite.The sections are divided logically into aspects of culture and civilizations, such as burial, art, dwellings and food. For example, the ""Early Homes"" section shows 6 different types of dwelling, each with a descriptive caption. Examples are not just drawn form Europe, either, but from all over the world, which is a big plus. The book also includes copies and reconstructions of prehistoric art accompanied by legends that enumerate and decsribe the elements in each. The book works well for multilevel teaching, a small child can listen to the short introduction for each chapter and the names of all the pictures; older children can get into the specific information framing the copious illustrations.This book is an excellent springboard to start learning about prehistoric peoples with children."
4,Great recorder. Well worth the money.,"The MZ-M10 is a great recorder. Don't forget it plays too, but I got it for recording live events. Sound quality is excellent. Set to loud noise in menu settings. The attachable battery pack (a single AA battery) makes sure you have enough power to record long live events, and fool the internal sensor to record if rechargeable battery is a little low.All in all great features and plays all my old recorded minidiscs and plays great in the car."
1,Flush your money right down the toilet!,"Be really careful of this one! We have been using the wipes for a few months and just this week we had a back log in the toilet. I was thinking maybe something else had happened and then the poor bowl couldn't take it anymore. The cost of the drain clearing was more then $150 USD! We came out with a grocery bag of kandoo wipes. I have only used 3 packs! I didn't flush more then the recomended amount and the backup happened at the end of our private line. If this is what they do at the end of three packs and a month or two, I can only imagine what happens to other people!Kandoo will be getting a bill from our home. Don't let it happen to yours!The product was a great idea for our son who was training. The marketing was perfect and we liked the orange packs scent. But overall with the misrepresentation of the product I have to flush this product down the drain....Ooops forgot, they don't flush!"
4,I liked it until it broke after 5 months,"This is a great cup for a new drinker. The dual handles are just the right size for a baby to grip. The capacity is appropriate. I found that it was best not to fill it more than an inch or so (with water) for drink-training. The weighted bottom is excellent. It won't eliminate spillage with the lid off, but it helps and my baby found the self-righting feature amusing. Sadly, dropping the cup from a table onto a hardwood floor was enough to separate the weighted base from the rest of the cup. I'll be trying some superglue..."
3,Training gear,The legs don't bend the arms don't bend. The toys reminds me of the original toys before the toymakers learned how to make fun toys that were worth playing with.
5,Great Themes of Scripture An insightful study of scripture,Richard Rohr is a gifted theologian. His work reflects a deep and thoughtful understanding of scripture and makes it acessible to the lay person
5,A GOOD READ,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK. I THINK JOE MORGAN DOES A NICE JOB DESCRIBING HIS CAREER AND A BIT ABOUT HIS LIFE AND FAMILY. JOE IS A GOOD COMMENTATOR FOR ESPN AND I RESPECT HIS OPINIONS. I REALLY ENJOYED READING ABOUT THE BIG RED MACHINE AND HIS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SPARKY, PETE, JOHNNY AND TONY. I THINK REDS AND PHILLIE FANS WOULD ENJOY THIS THE MOST. BUT ANYONE INTETRESTED IN BASEBALL WOULD ENJOY THIS. RECOMMENDED."
5,great new age-y violin albbum,"she's a little bit like loreena mckinnett, but she plays beautuful violin.my favorite is ""summer"""
2,Presley Mismanagement At It's Best!,"1973 began as one of the best years of Elvis' career with the huge success of his Aloha From Hawaii television special and the resultant double album, which went to number one. At this point Elvis should have entered the recording studio to create some strong contemporary material. Instead, all RCA could do is release this very average collection of one to two year-old tracks that were leftovers from various recording sessions. There's nothing here that is overtly bad, but also nothing overtly impressive. It's just another example of Elvis' management trying to keep the Presley machine going. It proves that even at this later stage in his career, Colonel Parker and RCA still didn't think of Elvis for what he was: a musical institution and a cultural icon. Unfortunately, Elvis never realized that either, and that was probably the biggest problem of all."
1,poor!,"Please just watch the dance scene and tell me what is this? Here is the worst possible choreography and dance and design. Salome-Malfitano is rather a poor dancer girl or a Carmen than a princess! And she can't dance. She is almost comic with her awkward figures. It is a very very bad performance. If Salome would have danced like that, I think Herod would have died with dissapointment."
5,hoping to make geography fun,"Bought this as a Christmas gift, hoping this will make learning geography in school more interesting for my grandchildren, they love the graphics"
5,Good Game,"We got this game to work on US geography with the kids (6&8). The game exceeds our expectations in that it is fun to play as well. After opening it we played 4 straight games. There is a good bit of strategy to chosing the states and transportation methods. Also, figuring out where your opponent is heading and trying to block them adds a new dimension."
1,These are junk,"I wasn't expecting perfection for such a low price. I was, however, expecting reasonable quality.A set of parallels should be surface ground on 6 (or at least 4) sides. These are only ground (and not that well) on the top and bottom (longest, thinnest edge). The faces are not ground, and are not useable lying down in the vice.The picture looks better than what was shipped, although I think it was good photography and not a productuct substitution.I'd send them back, but I already spent $6 on shipping, and it'll be another $5 to return them. Not worth it to get $12 back."
2,where r the rest of them??????,All other manufactures say that a 9-10 pound box containes apprx. 90-100 hooves.ALL I GOT WAS 60!!!!! This is crazy!!! WHERE ARE THE REST????
4,Très bon album d'un petit nouveau !,"Premier album très réussi. De nombreux morceaux agréables, avec le tube ""Au nom de la rose"", musique de Francis Lai tirée du film ""Bilitis"", film très érotique ! Les paroles sont à déguster, et se marient parfaitement avec la musique. A découvrir avec plaisir !"
2,Peaceful Death and Joyful Rebirth,"I like the portion of the book where the author tells us how to be helpful to the dying person. However, I don't like the portion where he describes the ""hell realms"".I have great respect for the author on his other book, Boundless Healing which I love."
3,More doubts than certainty,Reading this book was no fun for me and added very little to my understanding of the death process. The delog stories lack integrity
5,Tribute to Jose Alfredo Jimenez,"So , I've become a freak for Mariachi Music ! Ever since I watched, "" La Hija Del Mariachi ""--, life has not been the same !!This cd enabled me to take in another interpretation of Jose Alfredo Jimenez's wonderful music.Allthough , I am not a big fan of Pedro Fernandez---(I prefer Vicente, and Jairo Del Valle ! )---Pedro does a very good job providing a different interpretation. This is a keeper. Thank you Amazon and thank you to the vendor for the great shopping experience."
4,Human Resource Management,"I found this book to be a great textbook in class. It is easy to read, and is full of clear examples. The graphs and illustrations helped me visualize the information, which was very helpful during studying and test taking. The book is very well organized. Main terms and concepts are highlighted in bold, which helped me zero in on important information. Not only was this text helpful in class, but it also served as a very useful resource. I used many statistics, website addresses, and illustrations for research in areas outside of class. Most importantly, this book gave me valuable insight into the human resource arena which has guided me in my business career."
2,Unreliable,"I have had this player for a few months now. I am disappointed and dissatisfied with its performance. It has been replaced once.The first unit skipped for no identifiable reason, even on disks which were fresh out of the package. For example, it would play a disk perfectly, and the next time it played it, it would skip, and then the next time it would skip somewhere else. It was completely random.The replacement unit has skipped once on a new disk. However, the real problem with it is that it does not play some DVDs. So far, it will not play ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" and ""Chris Botti - Live,"" both of which played on the unit this one replaced. It also will not play the ""Band of Brothers"" series."
1,Completely Unreliable,"I have gone through 2 of these units and have had the same problems with each. First, the video will quit on its own requiring a reboot. Second, the dolby digital through the optical out does not work, only ProLogic. Third, when trying to eject a dvd, sometimes it will freeze up and require a reboot of one or 2 times.Very Poor Product!!! I am VERY upset I paid so much for this when it first came out."
4,"Good player, although on the expensive side.","I've only had the unit a short time but so far am pleased with the video and audio quality. I have it connected to an HK-AVR340 which has no HDMI input. During initial setup of the player this created a bit of frustration for me as the player's factory default is HDMI and s-Video output. I ended up connecting it directly to a Samsung HDTV with HDMI and changed the default to Composite video output. Reconnected it to the receiver, and it worked like a champ.Overall a good player, but like most other reviewers I found it on the pricey side compared with others on the market."
2,So far not good,"Since I've read so many great reviews on this DVD player I figured I would give it a shot since my Samsung was on its last leg and I currently own HK products. Well, unless I try to adjust some settings I believe this player is better at playing cd's than movies. The picure quality thats transmitted is horrible! Right now I rated it 2 stars just because it produces great sound as a cd player however I will mess with ythe settings and let you know if that changed my opinion."
5,covering almost all topics and clear explanations,"I have read the book and covering almost all subjects.Explanations are very clear and all process and examples are given step by step.To tell more clearly ,especially for active directory domains,the writers used understandable graphics and writtens.Oftenly the differences between win2000 and win2003 are given as trips.You can process examples on your pc without any problems because it seems that all examples were already tested.If you are learning windows2003 by himself,it is very useful to you."
3,Not a comprehensive guide,This book judging by its massive size seemed to be the end all comprehensive guide to everything server 2003. The main reason I bought this book was for info on IIS 6 and windows media server. The IIS 6 material in this book is phenomenal but much to my dismay not one word was written about deploying windows media server. How can u not even cover one of the most changed products from 2000 server? The windows media server has undergone some major changes which I believe warrant some kind of coverage in this book.Otherwise the book is very well written and covers the meat and bones of IIS and terminal services as well as AD. Alot of the book is for planning the migration and deployment of the server 2003 environment which is useless unless your running a fortune 500 company's IT dept.
5,Full of Valuable Information,"I usually do not buy the large books because the authors frequently just fill the chapters with random information to make the book fat (do you guys get paid by the pound?). However I read the preview chapter here on amazon and found the sample to have great information and the reviews have been very favorable, so I took a chance and bought the book.I went right to chpt 22 on maintenance practices and found some very practical tips on managing and maintaining dns, dhcp, and wins. The best practice recommendations on daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly maintenance were extremely helpful!The other chapter I went to was chpt 29 on group policy management. The person who wrote the chapter obviously has worked in a large networking environment where system management is a chore. The tips and notes in that chapter were very insightful!I'm glad to have found a big book that actually has valuable information from the start to the end of each chapter! Nicely done!"
4,well liked by all little girls,"I bought this for my 15 month old daughter after she saw it at her 3 year old cousins house. It has proven to be a favorite item with all the little girls who have come to our house. It did come with small jewelry that was inappropriate for a 15 month old so I simply took out the small jewelry and replaced it will a couple large plastic bangles. She loves the lights, music as well as simply opening and closing the lid over and over and storing her bracelets inside. When we first got it, it was a bit hard to open because the latch would catch. However, after a little pulling and realigning it has worked flawlessly ever since."
3,nnnn,Looks better in pic. No place for c cards. Too simple. disapointed because it was a xmas present for someone.
4,Short but funny and well written,"I recently started watching the Dangerous Davies series on television, and decided to try the first book in the series. The book is good, but I prefer the television series. It's probably a one-time read, but that was enjoyable."
2,Good Old Fashioned Pulp crime Fiction,"Readers; Yet another installment of the Dangerous Davies litinany. Not much changes from one book to the next. The plot wanders here and about. The 'cast' bumble along with little thought to the context. But for all of that, they are an enjoyable read for a bus ride home, or on an airplane, it holds your interest, and if you leave it on the seat, you'll not weep over the loss. This is not crime fiction along the lines of P.D.James et al. but it is 'fair to middling'"
3,"Dangerous Davies, the Last Detective","Having watched the videos of The Last Detective, I was curious about Leslie Thomas and the book. I can see how the episodes were developed from reading the book."
3,Not Up To My Expectations!,"I am a huge fan of Two Leaves and a Bud. They make a beautiful English Breakfast Tea and many others. I ordered this giant box of White Tea being a Tea lover and especially a White and Green Tea lover. The idea of Rose Pedals in my Tea was also enticing and I dreamed about early mornings on my deck, sipping White Peony Tea with Angels flying and Songbirds singing. Not really. But I did have high hopes for this Tea and I was let down. The leaves are too small, the Tea goes bitter quickly and it's hard to brew as the bag won't immerse easily in the water. Try Mighty Leaf Teas for real White and Green Teas. They are almost unmatched in quality. For more reviews please visit my blog [...]"
4,Good staple item,These are good staple item. The quality is acceptable. I think the Fruit of the Loom tees I bought at the same time are a better quality and have held their shape better. In regard to sizing... my son wears size 5T in most every other shirt and these fit perfectly.
2,VERY THIN FABRIC,"I know this is a tshirt undershirt, but............we bought these to paint and do tie dying with. I wanted a good quality tshirt to do that with. This was NOT IT. We did the tie dying anyway and it turned out fine. But I was looking for something thicker, all white....that was not so thin you could ""see skin"" through the shirt. For an undershirt under a shirt (to not be see), it would work though."
3,Good but to short,"This version of Pimslur German teaches good pronunciation and what it covers it does well, and you will retain it. The problem that it does not cover very much. If you are a guy and want to know how to ask a German girl out it my help. The Pimsluer method works but this course is to short to be of real practical use.I would recommend getting the travelers addition it has 8 tape, not the meager 4 of this set.Mark"
3,good but overrated,"I have always considered this is the best of Strauss's operas if not the best opera, period. This DVD does contain some of the most exquisite singing by an amazing cast, great lush sound from the orchestra under James Levine with interesting rehearsal documentary. However, the whole production is sterile in its staging. Furthermore, there is a distinct lack of chemistry between the singers on stage (particularly that of Act II). I am not usually a person who focuses on aesthetic of things, however I do believe that operas (especially when you spend so much money) should come as a whole. This is a great recording to listen to but there are better ones out there with equally good singing and stupendous production values. A sure bet would be the Salzburg Festival production in 2001 with Polaski, Graham, Dessay and Villars. This DVD may not be available in US but I'll be more than happy to help anyone who needs to locate it!"
2,Not a good role for Jessye Norman,"Jessye Norman does not have the clear, crystalline, high soprano required for the role of Ariadne/Primadonna, whose greatest exponents to date have been Eliz. Schwarzkopf and Gundula Janowitz. Norman is the opposite kind of soprano: rich, earthy, and deep. She's great for some operatic roles but not this one. Also, her german diction suffers from numerous defects.Kathleen Battle is too annoying for words.The conducting is mostly heavy and un-Straussian.Unless you have an attachment to one of these two sopranos, I really can't recommend this performance."
1,NOT accurate,"This tester showed full charge for various alkaline batteries that had been partially or moderately depleted (and cross checked with a voltmeter.) The only rechargeable batteries on hand were fully charged already, so I cannot comment on the accuracy for that mode, but given the poor performance and lack of accuracy with alkalines, I would not recommend anyone to get this unless they (only) needed to separate dead/fully depleted batteries from those with some level of charge."
1,Non functioning product,"The idea for this battery tester is good, 5 LEDs giving an indication of how much charge is in the battery. However, the unit I received turned on all 5 LEDs when the battery voltage of a used up 1.5 volt battery was about 1.2 volts and none of the LEDs turned on when another used battery with about 1.1 volt was connected. I highly doubt that this scheme can work."
5,Convenient!,It measures potential difference very nicely. Very convenient and easy to use. Next best thing to a multimeter.
5,Works Like I Hoped,"This item works as described, and seems to do a good job of testing batteries. On AAA batteries the - metal connection sometimes look like it misses the metal of the battery. Outside of that it seems pretty good. Will see how it holds up over time.The first day I got it I tested 3-4 batteries. Then I found a bag of older batteries and 3 of the 10 were still good. So right there it saved me about $1 because those batteries were headed to recycling. With time this will pay for itself by saving good batteries, not only that, it will save me time and frustration of testing batteries in a small flashlight or finding out they are duds."
5,Does Just What it Says,"This is a great little battery tester. I haven't had any problems with it at all in the 6 month's that I've owned it. It says that it'll only test AA, AAA and watch batteries but it can also test 9 volts. Just place the 9 volt terminals on the watch battery terminals and hold it there. This is great for testing rechargeable batteries. I will fully charge a rechargeable battery and let it sit overnight. Then I'll test it and if it reads a low charge then It's off to recycling heaven. It's no fun to place a fully charged battery into a camera only to find that it dies within 30 minutes of use. This tester will prevent that by letting you know when a rechargeable battery is at the end of it's life."
5,Love it,Very useful. Has saved me a ton of money. I use lots of batteries for my camera flashes. This has come in really handy.
4,Perfect on AA / Good on AAA,"My family goes through batteries very quickly but they do a poor job of keeping the old batteries away from the new ones. The LED lights worked perfectly on each AA battery I tested. On some batteries the LED did not light at all. This is because the battery was completely dead. I did notice that on the AAA batteries, there were times when I tested a fully charged battery and the lights did not come on at all. This is because the contacts on the charger make for a snug fit when testing a AA, but not so much for the AAA batteries. Knowing this is helpful because you could wind up throwing away fully charged AAA if they are not making good contact on both ends of the battery."
5,"Excellent Product, Just buy it.","Most compact, reliable, good quality tester. Very handy to check batteries before carrying or to put it for charging. Within 2 secs you have the indication of power levels."
1,This is a PIECE of JUNK,"A definite buyer beware. I read the negative reviews but figured ""It must work...."" Wrong. This is an absolute cheap piece of j-u-n-k. Depending on how you put in the battery it can give the same battery totally different readings."
4,Great for Audio Technicians for cordless mics,This removes your guessing about how much power is left. It is great for Audio Technicians that need to estimate the time left on a AA batteries for a cordless mic. The only drawback I've seen is the spring is a bit delicate and may break after a few hundred uses. So you might want to buy two. I easily repaired our broken one with a better spring.
3,Not One of Grandpa's Favorites,"We bought two of these for our toddler grandsons and my wife had to play with them first. She drove me nuts! The music bits start out with a promise of a catchy beat, but it doesn't last longer than a second. As soon as another button is pushed, the tune changes (no pun intended). The kids will probably be quite pleased because of the ability to create different sounds, one right on top of the other. Thank God for a volume control!"
5,great toy,"I bought this guitar for my nephew over 6 years ago, he just recently gave it back to me for my 9month old daughter to play with. It's still in great shape and a wonderful toy. We all enjoy playing it!! Great fun, great value."
2,it's TOO LOUD!,"A friend bought this guitar for my son after he had played with it at someone elses' house.When we opened the box - the toy was a LOT louder than i had remembered. There's no way to turn the volume down, and it just intensifies the obnoxiousness of elmo screaming 'rock and roll!' ad nauseum.My son loves it, though. I've hidden it, and i'm hoping to get rid of it soon."
5,A lot of bang for your buck,"When I go shopping with my 16 month old son I usually begin at the toy isle to grab something that will occupy him while I push him around. He normally loses interest in most of the toys before we even leave the store. This one, however, made him smile and laugh with wonderment. The size is perfect for his little hands and his 3 1/2 year old sister even picks it up and plays with it for a while. It is somewhat loud but it only plays while the child is actively playing with it (unlike others that you have to shut off). Sometimes you can't predict what a tiny child will want to play with but this is certainly a hit at our house!"
1,Don't order from this seller...,"Ok, so reading the description of the item, you would certainly think that you would be recieving 50 boxes if you placed and order for one pack. After all who is going to pay $26.66 for a single card board box? And as I said the description says each pack is of 50 boxes and even the details list the shipping weight as 26lbs, so again thats got to be 50 boxes right?... well thats not what I got. I got three individule pet carriers shipped in three individual boxes, nothing on the packing slips says I will be getting the other 147 boxes I thought I ordered. The boxes themselves are what I expected since I have ordered this exact same box before from different sellers, so if you like the box just go find another seller cause these people are misleading. Amazon customer service treid to help, but they couldn't explain what happened either so unfortunatly the boxes are getting sent back, no way am I paying that much for a box."
1,False Advertising,"The ad says ""pack of 50"" but the company only sent me 3 boxes. I was expecting 150 boxes. They said the price was for only 1 box, which is crap because the original price of $110 would NOT be for just 1 box."
5,Even better to hear than to read it.,"I absolutely love the Rumpole stories, but I really enjoyed these audio tapes. For one thing Leo McKern is wonderful as Rumpole, and he is even good at doing voices for other characters as he does in these tapes. These tapes cover two stories that I've read before - ""Rumpole and the Blind Tasting"" and ""Rumpole and the Old, Old, Story"". Both are hilariously funny, and McKern brings the old curmudgeon to life. For those who don't want to take the time to read these truly wonderful stories, then listening to Leo McKern on tape is a wonderful way to introuduce yourself to the guilty pleasure of old Rumpole."
2,its a pain in the ear,it looks swanky and slick however in actual use the insert causes irritation in the ear after some use. i would recommnend u go with the conventional circular inserts for the ears. but yeah the reception of sound is crystal clear! i mean no disturbance or intereferrence of any sort!
4,"Recommended by P.D, James!","In an interview with P.D.James she mentioned that she often read Sue Grafton, and that's as good a recommendation as you can find! I began with Q,R,S, not finding the earlier books on Kindle, but as so many readers have discovered, it's better to start at the beginning. Great to find three-book sets on Amazon. Wil start with A and go through to the end. Easy reads, good plots, very enjoyable."
1,"Nasty, crass, crude, rude, and tasteless",Sue Grafton lacks taste and tact. She is as crass as any merchant marine. Her language is distasteful and offending. Her unnecessary scene details and followups both offend and affront. I will not purchase another of her books.
4,Time to play catch up.,"It's been years since I have read anything by Sue Grafton. I was in a book store when I noticed she was so far into the alphabet! I decided it was time to catch up and saw this compliation of her stories.I am starting from the very begining of the alphabet all over again to refresh my memory! While the novels do not need to be read in order, I get a better feeling of our heroine! And once again, I am enjoying the books more than ever! Can't wait to get all caught up again!"
4,Such Drama and Suspense,"C is for Corpse by Sue Grafton is an intense book that leaves you craving for more of Grafton and Kinsey. Kinsey Milhone is middle aged, single, and a private investigator. In her newest case, Kinsey meets Bobby Callahan who asks her to help him find who tried to kill him, but just left him brutally scarred, and with a bad memory so he cannot remember many of the details of the accident that left him crippeled and killed his best friend. Soon, Kinsey is in the middle of three mysteries, and hoping to solve them before its too late and soon there will be a mystery about her death. The suspense is so think at the end of the book I found myself skipping passages just to find out what happened next."
5,Love Sue Grafton,"Sue Grafton is one of my favorite authors. Some years ago, I had loanedthem these three books out. I had been looking for them in this capacity. The book was in brand new condition and arrived very promptly."
4,Review of The Runners Book,"Many years ago when I started running, ""The Runner's Book"" was the first publication I purchased about running. In it I learned many basic stretching techniques, running styles, and ways to prevent common injuries. I learned about shoe design, and how to get the most out of every workout. This book served as my ""beginners bible"" of running. It sat on my bookshelf right next to Jim Fixx's ""Complete Book of Running."""
3,"Outdated, but still good","Mountain biking technology has changed significantly since the time this book was published. The techniques section; how to go uphill, how to go downhill, how to negotiate the different types of terrain is still valid. The photographs help illustate the technique."
3,desperate is better,"This is an good start but you can do better. Their first disc ""Desperate"" is by far a five star disc, pure attitude that's what makes this a great disc but very hard to find."
2,KoveRoos (DuPont Tyvek)?,"I bought this cover because of the Tyvek material hoping it would perform well as a table cover only to see the metal eyelets of the drawstring system, tear out of the material upon first use. Thanks to Amazon, I was able to return for a heavier cover."
2,"Interesting, but confusing","This book did not get really moving for about the first 100 pages. It was well written, but I didn't think it was THAT scary! Endings are such a large part of a good story in my opinion, and I was left feeling disappointed and confused by the twists at the end. What happened to Adam? It wasn't a complete waste of time to read, but it's not one I'd go around recommending either."
5,Don't Miss this One!,"This is one of the best supernatural novels I have read in a long time. It is like a long episode of The Twilight Zone with a little Jack Finney (who the author repeatedly refers to) thrown in. The book theorizes that most paranormal activity is created from the mind and can be explained by things like telekinesis and mass hypnosis. Based on this a group of researchers believe that they can create a ghost. They go about creating a history of their ghost along with sketches of what he looked like. They are successful, however, something goes awry and what they unleash is pure evil and the reality they knew slowly begins to fade. Great characters too!A real page-turner!"
2,"so-so story, unconvincing voice","A tale of the supernatural, not bad in theory but ruined by the clumsy voice of the author. He sounds like an elderly Englishman trying to sound like a young New Yorker. His characters are thirtyish, but sound sixtyish or older and he conveys absolutely no sense of place. I have lived in NYC for some years and believe me, this is not how people talk. If you can get past that, and you like this genre, you might like this book."
3,Incredible concept,"This book has stayed in my mind for years. The concept behind it was incredible. A group of people decide to create a ghost out of the power of their minds. It's concepts related to quantum physics thrown in with the paranormal were unbelievable. Yet, the book feels almost not quite finished. As if it still needed editing, but I would discourage anyone from reading this book, in its way, it is ground breaking."
3,"confusing, good but scary","I liked this book, but in the end it got to be a bit scary. Unfortunately the ending is confusing, but definitely a must read"
2,CONFUSION FROM PAGE ONE,I THINK MR. AMBROSE SHOULD HAVE RE-READ THIS BOOK FROM THE MIND OF A SOON TO BE READER BEFORE HAVING IT PUPLISHED. LOTS OF CONFUSION RIGHT FROM THE START AND THE END IS NO DIFFERENT. I THINK THAT Mr. AMBROSE WRITES FROM THE SOUND OF HIS OWN DRUMMER AND NOT TO ENLIGHTEN READERS ON A BOOK THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN EXCELLENT READ. THANKS norman r caster
2,It didn't keep me awake,"Rather than jangling my nerves it almost put me to sleep. Who could be intrigued by this poppycock? The writing was satisfactory but not worthy of being published by a major publishing company. Too many stereotypes and too few gripping moments. Contrary to many other readers, I found the early part of the book superior to the later chapters where Mr. Ambrose seems to have lost his way. Where was the editor to allow the use of the word ""Chinaman""? The ending, however, did catch me by surprise."
3,"I enjoyed this book, but I COULD put it down.","Let me start by saying that I definitely enjoyed reading this book. From the first paragraph, I was drawn into a well-painted modern Manhattan world, but I definitely could put it down. It was very amusing and thoughtful. It also brought up the possibilities of an alternate universe, kind of like a scary, 20th century ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (with regards to what would happen if certain events did and did not happen and how they would effect the lives of certain people) with a Oija board and different set of characters. Although this book did not ""grab me"" and make me hold on, the writing was precise and intelligent, and because I love this genre, would probably look for other titles by this author, since it was a quick read."
4,Not Quite Superlative Schubert,"This is Graham Johnson's usual high-quality, intelligent music-making, with a banquet of programme notes. It takes longer to read them than it does to listen to the album. I enjoyed the performances of Anthony Rolfe Johnson and Michael Schade on this recording, but alas, they are overshadowed John Mark Ainsley, as they would be by anyone who can make the hackneyed Standchen sound fresh and new. Would that he had recorded the entire album!"
2,"Beautiful picture, but major compatability issues","Love the picture quality of this frame, but the process of copying and viewing photos is an absolute nightmare. I'm a software developer, so this ain't user-error. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why some photos just won't display! After 40-50 hours of troubleshooting, I'm ready to throw it out the window. But, alas, I keep trying. I just want to understand the rhyme/reason, and I'll follow the silly rules, I promise! The card-readers... especially if connecting the frame to your computer to transfer photos... are so incredibly buggy. I can see the photos right on the card through my PC! But for some reason, they just ""don't show up"" on the frame. Frustrating. And customer-service is worthless.I'd keep researching and find another frame if I hadn't already sunk so much time and money into this one. My recommendation -- don't buy it.If anyone has figured-out the secret to the above problems, please, please, please post them here!"
3,MAC users -- you will need a card reader!!!,"I bought the sd card and thought i was ready to go. Mac users, you can not update the sd card while its in the photo frame. How about some documentation letting me know, Philips? You will need a card reader to get around this limitation. Internal frame storage is poor, about 15 MBs. Know before you buy. I'm sure I'll be happy eventually, but it's just such a hassle."
5,very happy with the product,"I bought this Phillips digital frame for my wife; we're both very happy with it.The pictures are clear with vivid color.After finally understanding the directions, it's very easy to transfer ones photographs from a computer to the frame.The slide show feature is attractive with a variety of different transitions from one photograph to another.The only quirk I've encountered is in programming the date. The frame won't acknowledge a date beyond the 12th of any month. Frankly, I find that problem to be insignificant; I'm not using the frame as a calander.The frame, itself, is very stylish and appears to be very sturdy.I spent time researching other frames at a variety of prices. I have to say that one should spend the extra money.Overall, this Phillips frame is tremendous buy and worth every penny."
4,Great digital frame,I bought this frame for a gift for my dad and had it delivered to me so I could load it up with photos. The power cord didn't work on the first frame I received and I had to send it back for a replacement. My gift was late since I had to return it for a replacement. The next frame I received worked fine. The frame is very nice looking compared to ones I have seen in the stores. The picture is super clear. Once I got a working power cord it was super easy to work with.
2,Hard to use interface,"The Picture frame has a nice crisp image quality, but I found the interface hard to use. The memory capacity was very low too, and could only upload about 10 pictures (high resolution). I was frustrated with the direct link to the computer, and a flash drive might have been easier.Overall I found it very hard to use."
2,Poor customer service and Sequential mode does not work,"I received the Metal frame from Amazon. Apart from the really poor PC software, it worked fine except the pictures ALWAYS show in RANDOM order (whether you pick RANDOM or SEQUENTIAL)! After a couple of emails and phone calls, Philips ""Customer Service"" agreed to replace it. I had to ship it to Philips at my OWN expense.After waiting over a month, I have received a replacement. It's the Wood one -- I wanted a Metal one! I called ""Customer Service"" and they said they probably didn't have any Metal ones in stock.Anyway, the killer for me is that SEQUENTIAL photo viewing does not work on this one either!! I have 400 photos on my SD card and they can only show in RANDOM order -- that is ridiculous.I have bought Philips products before but this will be the last that I buy..."
2,DISAPPOINTING!!!!,"The 9-inch digital frame is very attractive in appearance. The PowerPoint-like animation is quite nice as well. However, I am quite disappointed with the onboard rechargeable battery. I recently purchased two frames with the understanding that the battery would last about 8 hours. I needed them for a 3-day show that lasted about 7 hours each day. This model was chosen to avoid the need to run a power cable to them, due to location. The batteries lasted a maximum of about 1 hours. It was both cumbersome and very disappointing to make this type of investment only to be frustrated with a product that did not measure up to its specifications."
3,Good product but bad photo software,"I spend about 3-hrs trying to figure out the flawed software. It has problems transferring pictures to a SD card. The software kept hanging, when I tried to copy more than five pictures from my PC. It also crashed my new windows Vista for the first time in 3-months. As such, it seems to be a good product. Wish they had a good photo transfer software and bigger internal memory.Update July05, 2008: I have found a way to work around the flawed Philips software and its interaction with a SD card.Step(1): Move your pictures, 50-80 at a time, to the internal memory of the photo frame.Step(2): Now using the ""move"" function in photo frame, move the pictures from internal memory to the SD card. Step(3): Repeat #1 and #2, for all your pictures. Phoof! This works like a charm.If you are having problems transferring to your photo frames SD card, this will help."
1,Confusing to Use -- Too Many Options,"We found this frame impractical and have stopped using it. It's loaded with features, which makes it difficult to setup and use. Instead of just loading pictures, you have to assign and configure albums for your photos. Wish I could just load the pictures and enjoy them."
3,"Good gift idea, needs time to figure out","The first impression was -- it's heavier than i thought. Frame itself is sleek, display area big and nice, picture quality is good, and the slide show function works great. Connection to my PC works well, no software needed (I am running windows XP). Great gift for grandparents to admire a lot baby pictures at a time with no fuss.Downside: the buttons on its back are not easy to handle, manual is very basic. The way display albums arrangement is a bit confusing, and when picture size is bigger (than 800K?) it's slow to display, takes up to 5 seconds more to show. Also, the plug position is poorly designed so when plugged in (USB and power cords) it's not easy to stand still itself."
5,Great Digital Frame,"This frame is of superior quality construction. It is made of real metal, not just a plastic with a metalic finish. The resolution quality is very high. I purchased another brand frame and returned it due to the low picture quality once I owned this one. The only feature I would like Philips to add would be a motion detection option. Great product!"
4,Works Great,The reviews almost turned me off of this frame. I purchased it anyway and I am very happy with it.
4,"Nice design, poor battery","This digital Frame has a nice design, easy to access to the menu, But I would desire more battery just if you want me to tell something. It is a nice frame and it isn`t expensive at all if you consider the quality you can get."
1,dissapointment,"I spent a lot of time to organize my photos on the computer renaming them so they all are in proper time sequence. Guess what, the frame does not recognize the decimal order such that numbers 11 jumps ahad of number 2 like it was a binary code not a decimal number!Another thing is that the frame cuts the top of the photos and displays two different size images for the same photo in its setup menu."
4,Great product! Very happy with it.,"Bought the 9"" digital frame the other day. So far have been very happy with it. Yes, the lcd screen is only 8"" not the 9"" that I and some others expected. The picture resolution is very good. Even though it states the resolution on this frame is slightly lower than the 7"" model, I don't think it really makes a difference. The menu control buttons on the rear could use some improvement. They are not labeled except for the power button. This has lead me to push the wrong button on occasion. The onscreen menu is very easy to navigate. I was able to set up the frame in just a few minutes with very little input from the manual."
1,Mechanical problems - didn't even get to load photos,"I've read so many positive reviews of this frame, I thought it would be a no-brainer to select it. As soon as I charged it up and began to use it, I noticed the 4-way toggle was dead when pressing to the left. This makes it nearly impossible to access certain menus. Lifting it a particular way with my thumbnail managed to engage it sporadically.Then the metal stand shocked me - it's either a part from a different (larger) frame or was defectively formed. The frame stands perfectly vertical on the surface it's placed on (i.e., on the verge of tipping over forward). That renders it essentially useless as a table-top display.I didn't even bother trying to load photos, so have no comment on its overall electronic performance. It's going straight back to Amazon for a refund, not exchange."
4,"Digital picture frame, nice display",Great size with a beautiful display but no memory storage. You have to buy additional storage.
3,Philips Digital Frame,This digital frame looks wonderful and is mostly wonderful. The arm that allows the frame to stand is fragile which sorta bugs me.
5,A great gift!,"We purchased this gift for the ""other"" grandparents. Our son who lives in Taiwan just had a baby girl. When we went to visit her we brought a Philips 8-inch Digital Picture Frame for our daughter-in-laws parents. They were thrilled! It was easy to work and looks nice. A nice ice breaker!"
4,Good product but...,The frame works well but does have an odd stand with only two positions. This causes the frame to stand too vertical! Also would like to see the unit come with a remote. The software that comes with the unit for the PC is not very good.
4,Exellent product,"Just what I expected from a Digital Picture Frame, neither more nor less.the quality of the images is perfect and can be apreciated from meters away. 100% recomendable"
3,Nice But Not Worth The Price,"I ordered this from the TheFactoryDepot, but I see it else wherefor half the price. It's a nice product if you have the need, butnot for what TheFactoryDepot is asking. All of their prices are toohigh - seems they are over charging. Other then that the displaymay seem somewhat small, but it's a fun play toy for the home oroffice. As one of the worlds top software developers I demand thebest and I can tell you this is it."
2,Died after 5 weeks,"Worked great for 5 weeks then the screen went black. Tried a reset, but could not transfer pictures to the frame, so then I tried a compact flash card. It worked for 10 minutes then the pictures went away and the frame started rapid cycling (uncommanded) through some of the menu screens. Then, it died again, black screen, won't turn on or off, the power button lights but that's all. Called Philips, they were very nice and they are sending me a new one but it looks like, they have some problems or a bad batch of units. I paid extra for the Philips name, hope they come through with a good one.UPDATE: The replacement unit, which was remanufactured here in the US has been great. It's almost a year old now. No problems at all."
4,"Great Looks, Great Picture","This is a really great product. The picture is definitely top-notch...well worth the extra money compared with other cheaper models out there.Although aesthetically pleasing, I wish the stand was a bit more stable at angles better for viewing. The preset notch where they want you to have the stand makes the frame nearly vertical...I'd prefer a little more slope like normal picture frames.It took me a great deal of time and frustration with moving pictures from different memory cards to the photo frame memory and back and forth until I figured out that you could use the frame as a multi-card reader IF you connect it to your PC and navigate around using your My Computer explorer...it would have been nice for the instructions to share that information.Other than that, you can't beat the quality of this frame."
2,Not for serious programmers,"This is a text book such as a high school or junior college might use to support a Java class. There are lots of excercises, the programs come quickly. But the book does a poor job of teaching the basic precepts of Java."
1,CD no longer available,Book is great step by step but refers to enclosed CD with examples and software. The CD is no longer available so book is worthless.
4,"Didn't come, but cost was refunded","Somehow, the book never arrived. But when informed, the company immediately refunded the purchase price. Their while the book was not received, the refund without hassle was appreciated."
3,62mm +10 Digital Macro Close Up Lens,"Haven't tested it extensively yet, but made some observations about it. Remember the ""no free lunch theorem""? You cannot operate miracles with a $20 accessory. You will need a lot of light, a good tripod and work hard to get the objects in focus. The depth of field also becomes really shallow. Despite of that, the magnification is outstanding: tried it with my 300mm and made a sesame seed look even bigger than the bread!"
4,"Cute Book, Nice Lesson","Angelina is given the opportunity to donate things that she has outgrown to a charity box for second hand items. She includes Polka, her rag doll from her early years as a ballerina, as one of the toys she feels that she has outgrown. When Grandpa comes for a visit, he reminds Angelina of the fond memories that she had with Polka, and she desparately wants the doll back. Is it too late to find the doll again? Angelina learns that growing up is not always easy, but charity has grown up feelings to replace the things you give away."
1,Streetwise Small Business Turnaround : Revitalizing Your Str,"This book should have been called, 'Writing Business Plan's', because this is the only useful advice given in this book. Actually, your time will be better-spent reading books on writing a business plan because they can provide greater depth than this book provides. A good plan will help you identify areas that have lacked attention in your business, or detail ideas you for where want your business to go. This book does cover other subjects like firing employees and managing assets, however, it's all obvious information. This book is written for those who do not own a business."
5,The Ideal Guide For Corporate Turnaround,This book is a concise and thorough overview of the steps necessary to turnaround any business. It's easy to read style and frequent practical examples make this a must for any executive struggling to save their business.
5,Lowepro Ridge 10 Camera Case (Black),It is a compact case perfect for my requirements.it also allows me to store accessories eg addnl battery and storage card.it is perefect for my new camera and allows me to keep it snug in my pocket.
3,Expectations,I was under the impression that that a case and memory card was included in the purchase of the camera and the the price would be deducted from the bill. This has not occurred at this point. Notify me if this was incorrect. The items were what I expected.
2,small camera case,"This case is too small for a Canon A3000IS camera and the charger. Will find some other use for it or give it to the church rummage sale. The Lowepro Model Z-20 case provides a much better fit for this camera, charger and camera cards."
4,Great buy for the price,I just received this camera case and was honestly surprised to see how well made it was. I really wasn't expecting much for the price but as I said I'm more surprised and not the least bit disappointed. My digital camera which is exactly three and three quarters inches long fit perfectly in the case but with hardly any room to spare. So make sure your camera is really no bigger than I stated. The two compartments are roomy enough to store a battery and an SD card and even a small cleaning cloth. The case has a sturdy sewn in belt loop for ease of carrying plus a well made carrying strap. Bottom line is if you're looking for an inexpensive yet well made camera case then by all means purchase this one. Once again though be mindful it's for small cameras only.
5,Nice little case,This case is very nice and the camera fit perfectly in it. It is not bulky. Made for a nice gift with the camera we gave family.
1,Somebody goofed,"Well, it was easy to just add a case for my new Panasonic ZS8 camera, right? Only thing....this case DOES NOT FIT this camera. You would think someone would have checked this out before matching up the 2 products, but not so. Wish I had known, but trusted that the camera I ordered would fit into the recommended case I ordered!"
4,"Does the job, but could look better","This case is fine for small cameras like the myCanon PowerShot SD940IS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch LCD (Black). Enough extra room for an extra battery and a few SD cards.I would like to see it looking sleeker. It looks like a mini backpack. I have another case that looks nicer when you hang it on your beltCaselogic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage (Black), which looks as slim as the camera. Then it doesn't give you much room for extra stuff."
4,Good for compact camera,"Not a fancy camera bag, but serve its purpose. The bad is padded well enough to protect a small camera. It is small, I could not fit my iPhone into it. There is a small compartment in front to keep your memory card. No place for a charger, but I don't think it is designed to do that."
4,nice inexpensive case to secure camera,"Got this for my wife's Canon SD800is. It fits nicely and securely. The extra pocket is great for the extra battery and memory card.Wish it had a belt snap (not a belt clip), but something with a snap or velcro on the back so it can be looped around a belt."
2,Camera Case,"The camera case is nice, but it is very small. My camera barely fits in it, so I give it 2 stars."
3,Ok for an inexpensive camera case,"It fits my point and shoot and it's USB cable fits in the front pocket but that's it. There is no additional room for anything else. It does not have great padding for the camera side either. The top-bottom-side that wraps around it has no padding, so the corners of the camera are unprotected basically. If you drop it, the corner of your camera will take the hit and not the camera case. I don't think you can expect more at the price I suppose though."
3,Too Tiny,I thought I might be able to get something in there besides the camera. This was wishful thinking. It is small and cute though.
4,Small,"Great quality but a bit on the smaller side, newer compact point and shoot may not fit in here. My new Panasonic FH25K did not fit, but my old canon Sd300 did.."
2,Nice case but too small...,"The case seems sturdy and I like that it has a few different compartments, but it is too small. It is big enough to fit a small point-and-shoot camera and a spare memory card, but that's it. If you want to fit in a battery charger or a data cable, forget about it."
5,Good and Cheap,"It's a good and cheap camera case for thin cameras. If your camera is thick, I recommend you consider other types of cases of this brand. I have two cases of this brand. The quality is good."
4,A worthwhile sequel,"Mexico's Francisco Xavier follows up his acclaimed ""Te Deseo Amor"" set with another collection of boleros. The material is not quite as strong as on the first album and the production is far more ""pop"" sounding, but it's still an appealing album. His voice is perfectly suited for this kind of material, much more so than Luis Miguel or Alejandro Fernandez."
5,I love this book,"This book is a must for all those who are fasinated with our wonderful world of Science and how it works. I love this book. As a parent as well as a high school science teacher, this book is priceless. I have learned over the years that children learn faster when they are learning with a sense of humor combined with facts.This book combines both beautifully. It is a must for every educator and parent who wants their children to know about the wonderful world of science and wants to help unfold the mysteries underneath the why's.Laurie Emerson, Biloxi, Mississippi"
2,The good and the bad,"I am basically a 100% newb and this is a great place to get your feet wet in electronics. That being said, I was hoping to be able to build some of these projects though. I'm not a guitar player myself but was hoping to give some cool pedals away to friends. After diving into some of the projects, even buying a few parts and pieces, I realized there are very few of these projects that are even buildable. He uses an IC in most of his projects that isn't available anymore and I haven't found information as of yet on a replacement. Even if I did I would have to redesign the circuit boards in the books to fit my needs. Other reviewers made this clear and I should have paid more attention before buying the book. There are other books out there that are cheaper that will get teach you the basics, this was sadly a disappointment."
4,"Thirty years old, but still the best ANALOG guitar electronics book","I've had my copy for many, many years and have built many of the projects in the book, or ones similar to them. You can find a lot of the information from this book, and similar circuits using modern components online. But the book is still a good starting place.Should it be updated? Absolutely, but what's here isn't incorrect or superseded by newer information, rather you need to add to it with some searching on the web. Electronic components have changed immensely since the book came out but once you understand what is happening in the circuits you can readily adapt."
3,"The projects work, but you won't learn a lot","Most of the projects in the book will work fine, but you are not going to learn very much from building them besides how to solder. I had worked as an electronics assembler before upgrading to technician and I can solder, all modesty aside, much better than ""the guys"" (the mostly male technician pool) but working with audio design is a little new to me.Vacuum tubes, which is where most of the interest from guitar players is today, aren't covered in this book, but neither are discrete transistors with their biasing and multi-pole filters. To be honest, I get the idea that Mr.Anderton regards the reader as having the technical ability of twelve-year-olds.The projects do work though, so if you just want a constructon exercise or to save money (if you already have a electronics bench of gear-you need a scope, bench supply and generator to do this,regardless of what he says) I can't criticize."
4,know what your looking at,"i'm in the electronics field but this book is still nice to have around for quick reference, also has some pedal mods in it to"
1,Pass on this one,"I picked up a copy of this book to get some creative ideas in my project studio, but this book is clearly for the do-it-yourself hobbyist who might have an interest in music, not for a musician. If you like playing around with circuits, building things from parts and such, this book might be of interest (although there are far better, more detailed electronic home project type books available), this book should probably not have ""musician"" in the title."
4,"Bad guys, bad guys, bad guys...","Whoa boy. Now these are what I call villains. Fae so evil they even manipulate the manipulators of Camarilla, Sabbat and Wyrm, not to mention the Thallain, the really, _really_ dark reflections of the normal fae. The next time someone calls your Unseelie troll an Ogre, introduce him to a real one..."
1,poor excuse for worship music,"This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable, emotionally charged pep rally. It really upsets me that this is the face of today's Christian music. The melodies are not easily singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches. This is worship manipulation at it's best. If you read the words to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of substance. They talk about actions to give God and our response to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this. God IS great, but WHY? This is VERY disturbing, and completely unacceptable for congregational worship."
5,Singable? Worship+Able,"This is a good CD and I've often seen people comment on how ""canned"" and ""unsingable"" a a CD set might be but it shouldn't apply to this great compilation.This is a very good CD with excellent worship songs. They can be sung and enjoyed alone in the car or in the corporate worship setting. Many of them are in use in churches around the country for times of corporate worship.There isn't a bad song on this CD and I love the few that I find like that. Usually you buy a CD for one or two songs and ignore the others. Not so with how great is our god. Enjoy every song and sing away!"
3,Good for the price!,"I bought this bed-in-a-bag set because it's cheaper than other brands. I'm not very satisfied with the product. The item description says ""The fitted sheet will fit mattresses up to 14 inches deep"", but it doesn't fit my 14"" mattress at all. It actually fits only mattresses up to 8 inches."
4,bed-in-a-bag,Order came SO fast! was hard to tell exactly what it would look like from tiny picture but I really like it. material is a little rough.
3,Not really reversible,"This is a complete reversible bed in a bag. The upper half bed sheet and lower half bed sheet are 2 different patterns, so they call it reversible.Otherwise great bargain at great price."
5,An excellent guide for beginners young and old.,"Well I have a few things to say about this book. I have tried several other ""tomes"" of knowledge written by the ""C Lords,"" but nothing seemed to work for me. I am going to be attending to NMSU in the fall as a Computer Scinece major and I wanted to get my feet wet so to speak. Gookin is an excellent author and he assumes nothing. Most books don't explain what #include <stdio.h> really does, or for some of us, how to type it. If you're new to C and no absolutely nothing about programming this is the best set of books you can buy."
2,Great for 6th graders! But of little help to me.,"I see alot of 12 year olds reading and loving this book, and That's great. But Im 15, And this book, in my opintion, is not suitable for those of us with some coding experiance. It's slow paced, concentrating more on humor then usefull stuff like socket coding, and has about as much cold hard C information as ""The essential C referance"", which is only around $5, and 109 pages. This book only leaves you with somewhat advanced ""hello world"" coding skills, and another 30 dollar book to buy.The ""plain english"" however was just that, and this volume would probably be atleast four stars if there was more information in the more than adequate 550 pages."
5,"instructive, clear, humorous.","I read ""The Absolute Beginner's Guide to C"" and thought it very good. It left gaps, however, in certain areas and covered some things too quickly. C For Dummies Vol. I AND II covers the same amount of information in two books, explaining the information in more detail. Highly recommended. The two volume set really got me programming in C so I could move on to other languages like Perl and C++."
5,A very good place to start,As a mainframe programmer who learnt to program back in the days of punched cards. I wanted something that would lead me gently into the brave new world of PC's and C and I found this book an excellent place to start learning. It's true that if you are not a complete beginner then the first part of Book 1 is stating the obvious but you can skip it. Unlike every other C book I've bought. This is an easy to read and entertaining introduction to what is fundamentally a very boring subject. It's obvious that the author knows his subject thoroughly and presents it very well. My copies of these books are invaluable to me.
2,C for really slow People,"I only have volume I - it doesn't make it as far as covering fairly standard stuff like ""pointers."" If your actually interested in learning the language you'll need both volumes.This thing moves really slowly - they hardly make it past ""hello wolrd"" by page 75. Lots of time / space wasted by joking around (like half the text). May be good for people with no programming experience - but if you already know basic or something similar - you can probably make faster progress by choosing another book."
1,Warning! Not for serious programmers!,"Warning! If you take programming seriously and want to consider it as a career, do not waste your money on these books. They are total garbage! I was fooled by all the good reviews and wasted my good earned money. The books are easy and simple to read (probably why all the good reviews), but so is a comic book. That doesn't mean you are going to learn anything. I have read many books on C and programming in general, taking a course on C at a university, and I can tell you the author's coding styles is very unorthodox and doesn't make any sense. If you have money to burn, don't care to much about programming and consider it a passing hobby, then this book is for you."
3,Dan Gookin needs to revise certain things in this book.,"Dan Gookin has written an excellent Volume 1. It explains everything in a very easy-to-understand manner. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about his second volume. Upon opening the second volume, I was anxious to learn more C in the easy way that Mr. Gookin teaches these topics. I was perfectly fine until he reached the topic of Pointers. I felt that this was the most poorly explained topic in either of the books. It was like I was trying to read a Microsoft manual or something. =) The rest of the book builds on this topic, so the rest of the book is basically useless. I would recommend you find another source to go onto instead of volume 2 after the completion of the first book."
2,Don't waste your money,"I managed to get about halfway through Vol. I. and then realized I still knew nothing about how to program in C. As one reviewer commented, 100+ pages devoted to just the printf function is useless. Useless as well were his examples. None of them have any practical application to the ""real world"" (business or otherwise). So if you are hoping to learn C so you can program something useful for work or your everyday life -- don't bother with this series. It is doubtful I will ever even go back to these books again. Too bad some lessons learned cost money...."
5,Best Damn C book I have ever read,"I have taken numerous programming classes and never clearly understood the functionality of C language.So a friend recommended these two books to me and I read them both in about 20 hours. I can't believe how quickly I grasped the concepts of C language. I don't care what other people wrote, I am just writing my own observation and opinion. I would like to shake the author's hand. I couldn't have learned C language any quicker with any other book. : )Jim"
2,"well, the title says it all","Even though I only gave 2 stars for this book, I must commend Dan Gookin for his amusing style of writing, and his intuitive layout for beginners. However, if you are serious about programming or want to become a software engineer, please avoid this book. It takes too long to explain basic concepts and doesn't go into much depth; it leaves you with a sub-decent knowlegde of C. I suppose it is not called ""C for Dummies"" for nothing."
2,Not for people who want to use this book with GNU/Linux.,"If anyone isn't using Windows with either Visual C/C++ or Borland then be warned that this isn't the book your looking for to learn C. I only have only acess to a GNU/Linux and use GCC as my main C compiler. Most of the code examples are oriented towards Windows/DOS systems because it uses the dos.h header for the programs in the book.Ontop of that this book is very much watered down. It takes until the second book that you learn about what header files are, which by the time I got to that book (mostly skimming through the first book) I had already figured it out on my own.I suggest people to buy the K&R C Programming book instead of these books."
1,VERY disappointed; Boring,Sorry but it's true. I've been a huge Hannah Alexander fan but this one just fell flat. Could not even finish it. I think it's time to retire the town of Hideaway and come up with something new and fresh.
4,fun,"This was an enjoyable book. It communicates the general gist of militatry development of the era, illustrated by four blow-by-blow accounts of obscure but interesting battles. This is no tome of historical reference data, but a fun bit of historical storytelling."
5,A Gift From God,You will get goosebumps when you walk through Jerusalem and you can turn in any direction you want or walk into buildings and look up and all around. Go straight to applicable bible verses. I'm making this a Christmas gift for friends and family. I actually got teary eyed when I saw the bible come to life. Very powerful. A beautiful and inspiring product. Thank you so much.
5,Amazing Bible Software,"This program is a must for anyone who wants to learn more about the Bible. The virtual tours are great, and having such a huge amount of Bible-reference materials tied to every verse in the Bible is truly incredible. What a great resource! I have already been using it in preparing Sunday school lessons, personal study, and showing off for my friends and coworkers. A must-buy!"
3,"Beautiful interface, occasional errors in information","I have run across a few factual errors, here is an exaple: I was going through the time line, and found that it says that John the apostle died in 6 BC, which is about a hundred years before he really died. I contacted the company, and they said that would be corrected in version 2.The movie viewer, if you select full screen, it will revert back to small screen, after a while."
5,Monumental Performance,When I bought this cd I did so to have a reference recording of Ernst's work. Little did I know that I had found one of the best violin performances on cd.Turban is one of the BEST violinists I have EVER heard. As far as combining astounding virtuosity AND deep musical understanding Turban seems to have few peers.I play this cd often and am always floored at his remarkable playing which is full of feeling with a beautiful tone.His performance of Shubert's Erlkönig is simply unbelievable.I hope to hear much more of Ingolf in the future.
2,Mahler: Symphony No. 10,"Mahler: Symphony No. 10 is a EMI records recording from 2000 and is under the direction of Sir Simon Rattle who leads the Berliner Philharmoniker. As with Mozart's Requiem this was not finished during Mahler's lifetime. While Mozart's Requiem is amazing (Franz Xaver Sussmayr did a quite good job), this Symphony is less then stellar and feels as if it would have been better to have left it alone. It sounds mostly like noise more then a real Symphony. Not recommended. 2/5."
5,"For a Great Ship, a Great Book","Hello!, I'm an enthusiast of the Kriegsmarine, I was waiting for the book, I've searhcing it for months, and finally it came!!!, as I expected from the Ballard's books, this is an amazing book. I began to be intrested in the Battleship Bismarck since I was 7 years old, and one day of 1989 I hear that: ""the man who found Titanic, now has found the Battleship Bismarck"". Since then I was looking for the book.It shows the aspect of the wreck and a lot of information about the ship. It also has a nice paints, which represents the descicive moments of the battle. A book that must be in the library of every one intrested in this subject."
4,About the Best of His Books,"Featuring a nice synopsis of the Bismarck's short history and some excellent period photos this book really shines in the details of finding the wreck and the assorted problems that crop up during this kind of expedition; everything from financing, storms, provisions, personality conflict, equipment malfunctions, and the seafloor itself. Not to mention piecing together pre-GPS navigation & position logs written from notes hastily scribbled during action.Also extremely interesting is how convincing opinions can form in the face of limited evidence as when the first expedition discovered not Bismarck but a schooner wreck."
5,Good As It Gets,"Visually and musically, I cannot imagine a better production of this opera. Yet, the opera itself is depressing as hell and if you want to sit through hours of opera that never seem to end which include lies, infidelity, betrayal, incest, murder, and in which everybody dies in the end, I'd stick with Wagner's ""Ring."" Somehow, the investment seems more rewarding to me."
4,Rock Is Back !!!,"Remember way back when music was about music, guitar driven melodic rock...well that is what these guys are all about...i have not stopped playing this CD since i got it...Seven Daze is all about the music, no filler just flavor...if you want a new CD that you can play from start to finish and not get tired of it...this is your band...I hope these guys come to SoCal so i can check out the live show...BUY THIS CD !!!"
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!,Bought this item because Beck Arnley is a great company and needed a new coil pack obviously. Got the package and it says Beck Arnley. Open it up and low and behold it says HUCO. Terrible company for coil packs and this company is terrible for selling fake merchandise!
1,old country roses spoon rest,Not as it looks the white is off white and very small. Not made in england but in china
5,It should be a candidate of this year's best disc of lieder.,"This disc is wonderful! With Johnson's excellent accompaniment, two young singers give us some noble and authentic performance. Both Doufexis and Widmer have an very neat tone and clear articulation, and their interpretations are noble, without too sentimental and over-emphysis. I found myself exciting listening to this newest Hyperion Schumann Lieder of this series, since I am a bit disappointed at vol 2&3. And I think, wow, the old excellent Johnson- plus- an- unfamiliar- but- extraordinary- singer is come back! I will nominate this disc to be a candidate of this year's best lieder disc. BTY, interesting enough, Listeners will find some of Clara's lieder here are better than Schumann's. Johnson's booknote is as same incomparable. The record is well. The only disappointment is the 2 lieder sung by chorus, it sounds a bit (only a bit) strange in structure and articulation."
2,Not what I had hoped it was.,"I was ""just looking"" so I didn't really expect much, but I still feel like I wasted my ""just looking"" spending money. Hard to explain, but I didn't enjoy this from any point of view - not from a Wiccan's desire to seek new information, not from an open minded individual seeking to learn a little bit about the Wiccan way. It just didn't grab my attention, Sorry Llewellyn!"
4,Excellent Introduction to Women in the Arts,"The Guerrilla Girls' present a quick overview of the omitted art history of female artists. The Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art performs as stated - each page is an easily digested tidbit of information about women's roles in art and the lives they lead. Most articles are confined to two pages and include examples of the artwork and pictures of the artists.In-depth information won't be found in this book, other than the additional resources list provided at the back of the book. However, this book serves as an excellent ancillary to any traditional art history book that vastly under-represents female artists. For anyone wanting an entertaining, yet informative, graphic-intensive overview of the women left out of art history books, this is a great starting point."
1,"Real battery, wrong item.","As the previous reviewer pointed out, this is NOT the KLIC-5001 1700 mAh battery as described in the Product Details, it is the lower capacity (1050 mAh) KLIC-5000.At least it is the Kodak battery, if that matters to you. (I have a new Kodak camera and want to protect the warranty.) If not, plenty of places sell the generic KLIC-5001 for less than Amazon sells the Kodak KLIC-5000."
1,a battery for kodak easy share z7590,"the battery is half the side of the battery came with the camera an last half the time, an number or not the same ,an it,s not the same battery. do not buy any thing from them because lying about what they are selling."
5,My favorite pony book,"I also read this book when I was around 8 or 9. I always dreamed of having a pony, and reading this book helped me feel what it was like to have one. I have looked everywhere for this one and the sequel Winter Pony. I am excited to finally locate something about them. I got my first pony shortly after reading these books, and he was in sad shape. I fixed him up and showed him just like the girl in the book. Ah memories.... Thanks"
5,Realistic and Fun,"Ginny, like many of us, has always wanted a pony. When she finally gets one it is not what she dreamed of: it's starving, ugly, and terribly dirty. However, as the book progresses she learns what it's like to be a horse owner; things aren't always as they seem. Readers will learn right along with this character, going on trail rides, having fun at shows, and learning that a horse is definitely the best friend that a person can have."
4,Memories of this charming book.,"I remember reading this book when I was about 12 years old. At the time, I was deeply, head over heels in love with horses and had always dreamed of owning my own one day. This charming book helped me live that dream inside my heart and mind, and to this day I remember this book like it was yesterday. I finally at 40 years old, have my own horse but nothing takes the place of those great days I had when it was just me and the ""Summer Pony"" book."
4,My most read horse story,"I too became an avid reader of horse stories in my pre-adolesence and beyond. I received this book in a Scholastic shipment I ordered in 5th grade and read it over and over again until it fell apart. A book that contains all the classic elements of a good horse story--the blossoming of a young girl and her less-than perfect dream pony, the all night vigil at the side of the pony afflicted with deadly colic, and the triumph of a hard-won battle at the show jumping circuit.A must-read for any lover of horse fiction...and I had no idea of a sequel, where can I find it????"
4,Ginny finally gets a pony.,"Ginny has wished for a pony of her own for years. When her parents agree to rent her a pony for the summer, Ginny is thrilled. But the muddy, shaggy pony that is delivered is nothing like the beautiful animal that Ginny had always dreamed of. Can Ginny turn this wreck of a pony into a blue ribbon winner"
4,One of the best car books I have ever read....,One of the most useful publications I have ever read. This book revealed secrets which gave me the confidence I needed to make an informative buying decision. Corey Rudl writes with an enthusiasm and genuineness that any car buyer will appreciate.
1,dishonest huckster,"corey rudl offers only one kind of advice - bad advice.if you are interested in double-dealing and annoying everyone you come into contact with, buy one of his products."
3,Buy the 6th Edition at least,"I bought this edition for a class, thinking that it would be good enough. Unfortunately it wasn't, and I had to return this book for the newer one. The newer (6th) edition has many changes and a lot of added content. So if you want to get a much better picture, spend the money for the 6th edition."
1,Rambles on endlessly... Impossible to read,"I had to use this as a textbook for an Asian Civilizations class. Every time we have a reading in it, it takes me forever to read. The sentences are almost always more than 4-5 lines, and it is not uncommon to find one that is 8-10 lines long. Who can keep track of what's going on when they're that long?!?!? I usually have to read every sentence more than twice. Not to mention everything is extremely opinionated, it's all written to the author's point of view and he doesn't share both sides of the story. I hate this author. It is impossible to read this. It is so dry... It cannot keep my attention. If you don't have to use this for a class, DON'T BUY IT!!"
2,Not Fun !,"This book has no pictures, it's pure history of Asia. There are so many ways to make history fun subject, but they really didn't even try with this book. I hated it!"
5,Excellent,"The book has it all. It should a koran or bible for every Albanian and I would urge everyone one to own a copy or at least read it. It is very carefully written and greatly researched, based on classical and contemporary sources of history, archeaology and linguistics. It is also extremely helpful in providing other research sources for related fields or works. Above all, it is true in content and as such unbiased."
1,I DIDNT LIKE THIS STUPID BOOK,"why?because,its prejudiced.its about a teacher at kristys school because of some books he said they should read.some christian parents get upset over it and get the teacher fired.why i dont like it is because it makes christians look like a bunch of hyperactive freaks who hate anything secular.well,newsflash- we arent like that.im christian,and i like a lot of secular things,this book not included.the author should be more considerate of her readers."
2,Not my favorite.,"I really like their shaving cream, but this was not my favorite- it is pretty greasy and the tip always gets clogged every morning with a chunk of material from the past morning. I would say look for something else."
3,Still on the fence,I like to try Jack Black products due to their usual high quality and natural ingredients. However I feel like I need to use a decent more amount if this moisturizer then I do with other products. This is my only complaint but given the price of this it is a pretty big one. Now if this lasts longer than I think it will i shall come back and give it 5 stars because it is a great product otherwise
3,Nice but leaves a slightly greasy feel,"Although I'll use the rest of the bottle, I probably won't buy this again. It goes on nice and light, but during the day when I sweat I get a greasy feel on my face. It takes about six pumps for enough lotion for my face, ears, and neck. Probably better for winter use than summer."
5,Men's Moisturizer,"Husband loves this product. It's a little pricey but he has dry, flaky skin from shaving and this smooths and softens nicely!"
1,Doesn't actually moisturize,"I have relatively dry skin. Especially after a hot shower and a facial scrub. Without lotion, my face gets a bit ""ashy"". I had been using Nivea for Men's Revitalizing Q10 lotion, but decided to give Jack Black a try since it's SPF 20 and it says it's ""Double Duty"". Sounded impressive. Unfortunately, it fell way short of my expectations. I will slather about 8-10 pumps of this stuff all over my face in an effort to get more moisturizing, and yet, in less than two hours, my face will be dry and ashy again. As if I hadn't put anything on at all. I'm sure some of you will appreciate that this lotion isn't ""greasy"", but you might as well not put anything on your face at all than spend this much money on a facial lotion that is gone in less than two hours. Returning this and going back to my much more affordable Nivea for Men Q10 lotion."
5,great product,"finally a face lotion that doesn't leave my face feeling greasy, works great. if I had one complaint it would be the faint baby powder smell, but a small price to pay for such a good product"
5,The only daily moisture lotion I'll use. Amazing product.,"This stuff is needed in every man's medicine chest. A light-weight, non-greasy, SPF daily lotion that works. I completely disagree with one of the other reviews that this smells bad. I think it had a very mild (almost not there at all) pleasant smell that actually gets less and less after application. It's nice to know you're smearing something on your face that will help fight skin cancer, but that isn't also filled with toxic chemicals, preservatives, and harsh ingredients. Jack Black hit a homerun with this product. I hope they never stop making it!"
4,Wish it went further...,"First off, I love this product. Living in Southern California, I need a moisturizer with SPF and this fits the bill nicely. My only complaint is that a little doesn't go a long way; in other words it takes two-to-three pumps to have enough to rub all over my mug. Maybe that's just picking nits. In any case it kind of smells like light baby powder, which I like, and it works like a charm. I'm a big fan of Jack Black products and this will likely be in my rotation of moisturizers."
2,Hasn't aged well.,"Human Instinct's third album is a more glossily-produced affair than its two predecessors, but musically it's the most conventional and least impressive of the bunch. While it's interesting to see long-deleted New Zealand prog-rock resurfacing on CD, none of the songs on 1971's Pins In It -- including the cover of Pink Floyd's ""The Nile Song"" - stand out as particularly memorable. The packaging too leaves something to be desired: the CD appears to have been mastered from vinyl, and the sketchy liner notes don't even mention the four live bonus tracks."
5,chev carb,The carb i received was exactly as it was described from the seller.I was very pleased with the item as it bolted right up and actually was setup right out of the box.I would recomend this seller for carbs to anyone.Robert
4,A Good Traditional Boccanegra,"In keeping with a lot of MET productions this is largely traditional. No surprises here. It is well sung even though Te Kanawa is near the end of her career. Domingo does his usual excellent work. Chernov is a great singing actor in the title role. The sound is excellent; the orchestra under James Levine is a known quality. Here he allows the music breathing space, not pushing forward as he can do. Easily preferable to the only other DVD Simon - an earlier MET production with a much weaker cast."
4,A pleasure to ears and eyes,"I am really happy when i got an Opera DVD and one can note the difference between it and a Vhs. If we compare this opera with Karajan's Don Giovanni or Levines's Aida, the colors and the definition is ten times better.Levine great as always. Chernov is a great baritone, and has a perfect look for the role he is mading. Domingo and Kanawa do a very good job either. I am not very happy with Lloyd's Fiesco. I could assure that he isn't even a real bass, when he finishes his aria ""Ill laccerato spirito"" you can note that his low F (the last note of the aria) is almost mute. I dont mind when a bass baritone sings a Mozart or Rossini's bass part, but when we are talking about Verdi, you need a real bass. He is a really good actor, so that saves him a little. In overall the performance is great and the chorus is well sung too."
5,a spectacular record,"Truly a great recording - sung by outstanding artists, especially Felicity Lott, and accompanied by Graham Johnson in his best form..... The music is truly glorious and the recording is a revelation with many beautiful nuances. A total joy!!!"
4,Not What we expected.,"We bought this for our daughter a few months before her 2 year check-up. She loved the Sesame Street characters - especially the Zoe ""bracelet"" (bandage) but the stethescope does not really work and the 'clicker' that you push to sound like a heartbeat is so loud with the earpieces in it hurt my ears. Also, the otoscope is just a hole through the plastic piece in this set. We took it back and got Fisher Price's regular medical kit. The case is a little different but my daughter can't make all the pieces fit in either one. In the regular kit the stethescope really works and the otoscope has a 'magnifier' in it so my daughter thinks it's really neat to look through. If you absolutely must have Sesame Street it's not all bad, but I prefer the standard kit."
2,Case may catch little fingers,I was pleased with all the pieces in this cute doctor's kit except for the case. When my daughter tried to close the case it caught her little fingers and pinched them. She is just 2 years old so we will just put the case up until she is better able to manage closing it on her own.
4,Awesome,Built To Grind...oh yeah!! This is the definitive story of Independent (the coolest skate brand ever) and also the whole story of skating in Cali and the US. Awesome photos and tons to read. Highly recomended if you live to sk8 like me.
2,disappointing,"Nice package it comes in, and it's so big, but I was expecting this book to be so much better, a few good shots, but really missing some of the greatest classic stuff. I guess it's from the manufacture's perspective. They have been an incredible story in the annals of skate history, and everyone who skates knows that Indy's turn like no others, but just becuse they also have a good logo known around the world by skaters and non-skaters alike, did we need to have this basicly boring book to be put out? I don't think it add's much."
1,Old Lady!!,I love Chanel Chance but this is awful.. There is nothing great about this fragrance. It reminds me of something my grandmother or an older lady would wear.
3,"Good perfume, but not great smell","The perfume is good, but not as great as the popularity of this brand and name. The lasting power is also not so good (atleast for me). I would not like to repeat this perfume in future. However it was delivered on time. So again full marks to Amazon for prompt delivery."
5,Chanel No.5 Parfum,"Price seemed too good to be true, but product was as advertised and delivery was very quick. Very good purchase."
1,Don't read this book. It's just so damn bad.,"I thought I knew the meaning of true pain. Then I read this book. Nothing has caused more damage to my psyche and my body than the experience of reading this filth. For the first 40 pages, I was simply bored. Nothing I haven't felt before. It wasn't until the second ""act"" of the novel when I truly felt pain. Reading this book was like sleeping on a pile of eels. Finishing this book was like french kissing a handful of rusty nails. I would not wish this novel on my worst enemy. Someone put a flaming fire poker up my ass so I can forget the pain this pathetic excuse of a novel wreaked on my mind. I just want to shove a deck of magic cards up my ass. Someone kiss me!"
4,excellent product,Leather luster is an excellent product. I use it on my patrol boots and they stay highly shined for up to 6 weeks. The initial stripping process takes about 10 times longer than the instructions claim. And it is easier to use laquer thinner to strip the boots than their stripper product. once you get them coated they wear unbelievably well and look good for a long time.
2,not worth the money -shoe shine,"I bought this kit for my husband, and it didn't workout for him. It gives you a nice glossy shine at first then it cracks."
1,pro-Christian propaganda disguised as something else,"""The history of medicine"" is a book that, on my opinion, has low informational density on history of medicine but is thick with Christian propaganda. I guess parents that home school children for religious reasons could be happy with it's religious charge. I am not sure what to do with it. On my opinion, it does not deliver what is promised in the title (just common knowledge facts, I learned more in middle school), the language is not among author's talents, so donation to a library is out of question. Definitely am not going to keep in the house."
3,Good book...not much help,"This book is a good starting point for someone looking for help with difficulties working with a bird with issues. But it doesn't give the reader enough tools to truly deal with these issues. It gives more of a summary of each issue and a few things you might try. Anyone looking for answers should use this as one of several books to read on the topic. Nikki is a great writer and it is a good book to start on the search for answers, but it just doesn't give you the feeling that you are truly prepared to take on these serious problems in the end."
1,Wasn't for me...,"I would not recommend this book. I understand the information, but being someone who is in therapy it made me doubt therapy and placed bad ideas about therapy in my mind."
5,Essential Reading for Any Women in Therapy,"Reading Deborah Lott's book was an amazing experience for me. I recognized so many of my own feelings and my own concerns in the stories she shared from other women in therapy. My eyes were opened to a greater understanding and acceptance of the powerful feelings that arise between women and their therapists. Knowing I am not alone in these feelings empowers me to face them directly and use them to move forward. Hearing the horror stories that some women have from their experiences in therapy gives me another reason to appreciate the man who has facilitated so much healing in my own life. Deborah Lott's clear and easy to follow presentation of the process of therapy from the clients' viewpoint has helped me to accept as normal the feelings of profound gratitude, fondness and yes even that ""L"" word, that I have encountered with my therapist. If understood and discussed openly these powerful emotions can be used to heal us and make us whole."
5,A Gift--A Must-read for All Women in Therapy,"Even if you are lucky enough never to experience transference and attachment issues with your therapist, there is plenty of good information here about the goals of psychotherapy, its history, subgroups and boundaries. And if you ARE experiencing transference, dependence, attachment or all three, do yourself a huge favor and read this book.An amazing book. Highly recommended. An absolute gift to women who are trying to use psychotherapy to overcome negative pasts and/or cope with the stresses and losses of the present."
4,Understanding Therapy,This was actually one of the books required for my Graduate School studies. I have found it to be VERY helpful in understanding the relationships between therapists and clients (not just women). I would recommend this book for anyone who would like to find out more about the basics behind therapy and how to develop great rapport with clients.
5,See the best of France,"If you want to see the best of France, just arm yourself with your Michelin atlas, Michelin Red Guide, a Blue or Green Guide, this book, a rental car, and your appetite for great food and wine.Any inn that appears in both the Red Guide and this guide will be a memorable experience. All inns in the Red Guide have professional service and great food. Inns listed in both guides will also be unique and charming. Coupled with the data provided by the Red Guide, the pictures in this guide are very useful.Best of all are the places in the countryside. Easy parking, phenomenal food, great wine, and usually a great setting. This is not a budget guide, but there are some great deals to be found. The cheapest place I stayed was an isolated Auberge in the Vosges mountains that charged only $50 per person for half board. This included a very small room, great 3 course dinner, buffet breakfast, and all tax and service."
2,Not all of these hotels are charming,"My wife and I first started using the guide in 1998. We have stayed at approximately 6 of the entries. Some were of excellent quality and value, but others we found to be of highly variable quality. For example, the last one we stayed in was in St Lo, Normandy and failed to any extent to match its description. The whole building including the restaurant smelt dirty.You need to be prepared to arrive at some disappointing hotels and just leave them."
5,"Helpful, fairly up-to-date, unbiased.","Less biased than some books on the subject. Discusses hysterectomies and less-drastic alternative treatments, including the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of each. Discusses different methods of hysterectomy -- vaginal, abdominal, and laproscopic, and includes the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of each method. Some hysterectomy books do not mention the newer all-laproscopic method of hysterectomy, but this gives it good coverage. Also pros and cons of what to include in the hysterectomy, especially ovaries which have a major impact. Includes an in-depth discussion of what to expect after hysterectomy."
3,This book is OK,"This book is OK. If you are having a hysterectomy, it will give you valuable information that you need to know. The Essential Guide to Hysterectomy by Lauren F. Streicher is a more complete book. If you're only going to read one book before your surgery make it the Complete Guide."
3,highly romantic music,"Angeles Ochoa is one fine singer and the producers have really done a fine job of providing great musicianship. ""Her clear, powerful vocals and her impressive knack for being able to get inside a song"" makes Ochoa a standout, as detailed in the reference book ""The Billboard Guide to Tejano and Regional Mexican Music,"" on Billboard Books. She is really fine and it's unfortunate Amazon.com does not have her first two CDs from the early '90s."
4,One of the best manuals for the intermediate technician.,This is not the best book for a beginner as it assumes you know how things generally work. It is not the best book if you are a seasoned professional looking to expand your knowledge. BUT it is the best I've seen to date on taking the tech with a little knowledge and experience (me) and making me a much more able and valuable technician. More valuable in the sense that I can now trouble shoot with a lot more confidence... go to this book - look up the procedure and then make the repair with a great deal of understanding. Not just guessing and hoping that I can reassemble the thing properly. To me it is a must have. It is clear - to the point - and covers a lot of little details that will make you look good time after time.
2,Standard Fabozzi book,2 or 3 chapters specific to the subject (in this case insurance) and the rest is the same fixed income chapters from 20 other Fabozzi books.
2,Not good,It doesn't worth more than any other book about fixed income and valuation. Just four chapters about insurance. Poor book.
4,A Good Read!,"David F. Babbel, a professor of insurance and finance, and Frank. J. Fabozzi, a professor of finance, compiled Investment Management for Insurers, an extensive series of articles (including six they wrote) on managing investments. Various experts contributed the other two-dozen plus articles. The book, which is organized in sections based on major investment management topics, focuses first on general insurance issues, such as risk management and setting up a performance management system for insurers. Subsequent articles cover fixed income products, valuation, equity portfolio management and measuring and controlling interest rate risk. This highly technical book may not be sexy, but it is very sophisticated and fully accessorized with tables, charts, graphs, mathematical formulas and footnotes. Let's be clear: it's a book for pros, an in-depth compilation that we recommend to professional and academic specialists in insurance investment management."
4,Works for me!,"This book was a real eye-opener for me. It unlocked the secret to decades of suffering. I have been following the diet for a month now, I feel much better, and I've lost 7 pounds just on my belly and hips (no exercise yet)! I recommend it for anyone who has been ""sick all over"" and doctors can't figure out what's wrong!!!"
2,Lacking,"The book had lots of info on research and such, but not enough to help me fix the problem. It needed more specifics on diet and lifestyle changes."
5,The Complete Guide to Yeast,"This book is packed with information on yeast overgrowth, symptons, rememdies, and meal plans. I found it very helpful in learning what yeast does to your body, how you develop candida, and how to stop the cycle."
3,Informative but redundant,"This book is good if you know nothing about Candidiasis. It really lays out the basics. What I really liked was the last section that describes the phases of the yeast diet. That was the most informative for me. Other than that I thought that each section on each disease or condition related to yeast was repetitive and redundant. Still very good info for someone who is ""new"" to these facts."
1,I was very disappointed in the content.,"I picked up this book hoping it would be a clear, concise view of how yeast can interfere with the body. What I found instead was an author so unsure of his own work, that he spent the whole book citing others information and neglecting to convey the actual information I was looking for! And to top it off, his ""expert information"" often didn't relate to yeast at all! I started the book with the assumption he was right-on (or I wouldn't have bought it) but ended up feeling more confused and angered at the huge waste of time this book was! His ideas were presented poorly, if at all. Information on diet was the best part of the book, but I've read a ton of other books that explain the same exact views better. Definately not worth the time."
2,"Need a natural approach program,not drugs","[this] book was ok, and I read [the authors'] first book. [The authors are] right on with diet and what to eat and what not to eat but perscritive drugs is not the answer. They only sugar coat the problem. Have to remove with a good candida program and lots of cultures that are natural. Why won't...doctors get back to basic and start giving advice the natural way and don't chemical drugs that damage other organs like your liver and kidneys."
1,Where's the Science?,"This petard hoisted on those desparately seeking an answer should be tossed in with all the other ""self-help"" suppositions that have no foundation in fact. It's rather silly to treat something that's so rare that even people with AIDS and HIV don't get! Sure, these poor souls are infected with candidia, but none are ""invaded"" in the intestines, except a rare few at the terminal stages of AIDS. Why, then, would so many women be at risk for something that the most immuno-suppressed people on the planet are not at risk? If just one scientific evidence had been cited, this nostrum might have some interest. But building a hypothesis on anecdotal herbal-craft, sending women who have serious illnesses in the wrong direction, borders on malpractice. So don't waste your money, much more importantly your time, on a hypothesis made of spun honey, written for no other ostensible purpose than to lear women into a false secuity about a disorder that doesn't exist."
1,A 600+ page advertisement for other books,"I was extremely disappointed in this book! I bought it because it was the most up-to-date of the Crook books, and was hoping for serious, factual discussions and step-by-step instructions on how to deal with yeast related problems. Instead, I find hundreds of excerpts from letters to the doctor (nice, but tiresome after a while), and broad overviews on important topics with references to other books. Getting to the most (in my opinion) important topic - modifying your diet - there is ONE PARAGRAPH about the initial diet and something like 'in general, you want to eliminate all sugar, yeast, etc...' OK, but how about IN SPECIFIC? This problem was repeated throughout the book - just when you think you're going to get some valuable, specific information, it says 'as discussed in The Yeast Connection,' or 'as discussed in The Yeast Connection Handbook.' I don't want/need an ad for THOSE books, I would like the information in this one!"
2,Bill Anderson is a biased review,"To start off with, the booklet IS outdated. It's 15 years old and the other reviewer is right, it doesn't cover mig (gmaw) and tig (gtaw). That's ok though. The principles in the booklet have nothing to do with what you use to make the weld. It's mostly an explaination of what physically happens to metal when you weld it and how to avoid creating stress points.Is it worth a read? Yes.Is it worth $30? Not even close.And the simple fact is that the gentleman who wrote this has died. The rights were aquired by Bill Anderson. The review written by Bill Anderson is nothing more than advertising, seeing as how he is the registered owner of network6000.com, a site that sells this book."
1,welding secrets not impressed at all,What a joke this book was. I expected some real good modern welding tips and all I got was a skinny little book of out-dated info. The book itself would probably of been thinner except for the fact that they duplicated 5 to 6 pages. I think Mr. Wilson should have kept his welding secrets to himself!
2,Welding Secrets,"I had the original version. I think I paid about $2.00 for it some 12 years ago. It was well worth that for the tips on how to correct problems that you encounter after you weld something, such as warpage or out of square. It is a thin book and has about a dozen really clever tips - well worth the $2.00, but now I see - with shipping, about $30.00 ! I don't think it is worth that much. The title is a little misleading in that it is not about the process ofjoining metal, but getting a fabricated object to be in the shape you want when you are done, or how to correct the effects of welding. Since I only paid $2.00 for the original, I gave it away a few years ago, thinking I'd buy another some time for another $2 or $3. Guess not."
1,What book?,What I received is nothing more than a copy of the original book it's just stapled together and the pictures are so grainy that their hardly any help. This should have been reprinted by a professional print shop.Though the tips on welding are good advice. It has a lot of hands on knowledge that's not in text books.
4,Worthy collection fills a niche in biblical studies,"This surprisingly heavy book is one of the few concordances I could find of the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible -- most works analyze the King James or the New International Version, so this is a welcome addition to the field, especially useful to us mainline Protestants who prefer the NRSV's scholarship."
4,Pretty thorough,"This concordance is a good one, but not as thorough as I would have hoped as a student of Christianity using it for reports for school."
4,good read,Follows the title to T. It really is principles. If you think this is going to tell you how to build a tree house you are mistaken. It will teach you how to design one and give you some ideas to mull over. Really good read on top of that.
4,Very Good,Very good book for dummys who wants to build a treehouse! Easy understanding and detailed information about every step on biulding.Also includes additional features if the reader wants to build a more elaborated house.
2,Not a book for my Kindel,Gave this book a thought then thought again. Think the Kindel price is to high . May have to think about the used version since this book is just a whim.Shoot me I'm cheep
3,Good for Beginners,"Good book to show basics, but a little disappointing. He pretty much builds square boxes and puts them in trees. I was hoping for a bit more creativity and inspiration as we work on our tree house. Most of this info can be found through Mr. Google."
2,A very expensive directory,"I am very disappointed with this book. Its content is not worth the cost. I was expecting a real self-training course on translation. It turns out that it contains 4 sample passages to translate for each target language (English-Spanish/Spanish-English) with their translations and comments. The rest, which is half of the book,is a guide of resources such as dictionaries, possible employers, and a directory of translation/interpretetion agencies, all of which can be easily found in the Internet. If you are interested in practicing and learning translation techniques, I have found thatManual De Traduccion : Textos Traducidos Y Comentadosis a better choice."
5,"Clear layout, easily navigable",I was really pleased to see that this version of the Kalevala has the correct line breaks instead of having it all run in succession. It makes for a very legible version. I also like that the table of contents links directly to the different poems making it very easily navigable.
1,A useful one-star book,"I came to this book after reading Alister McGrath's ""Surprised by Meaning"" ASIN:0664236928 Surprised by Meaning: Science, Faith, and How We Make Sense of Things]] wondering if there might be as scholarly, heavily referenced, elegantly and lucidly presented, and effective case against his careful review and powerful argument for man having meaning.This is not it. The authors are caught up in tangential and ancient arguments and heavily pressured by their terror that there may be a God. Only chapter 12 is at least current, but it's author is all involved with 100 imaginary unevidenced universes and creatures made of something other than carbon whose existence trivializes ours.I will look again for something to test McGrath by someone as calm and scholarly as he. Any suggestions?"
2,"Correct analysis, but poor execution","The problem with this book is really a simple one: the authors of way too many of the invited chapters assume too much knowledge on the part of the reader. Sometimes the knowledge assumed is familiarity with the writings of Intelligent Design proponents (e.g., Dembski or Behe). At other times, it is that the reader will be familiar with certain concepts, diagramatic conventions, or nomenclature of a specific scientific field. Either way, more discussion and review would have been worthwhile. As it is, many thinking people will be lost as they read this book. I know I was -- depite the fact that my Ph.D. diploma hanging in my university office where I am employed as a basic scientist suggests I should not have been! Oh well, the introductory and final chapters were worth reading."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this product for a home with a 4 digit house number. Not good for this product. You can not space the numbers so they are centered. You will either have a big space first your last. As I was trying to get the numbers in or out the nubmers broke. Not a well built product at all.
1,Disappointed,"I can't enjoy the story telling style of this book since the rythm & repetition of this book strikes me as annoying. Some recognizable dialogue would do this writing some good. While I can appreciate the setting & subject matter here, I must say that this book is hard to follow & I am disappointed."
5,A Solid Introduction,"The Truth of Catholicism is a good introduction to some of the Catholic beliefs and issues that are most commonly misunderstood and opposed by both non-Catholics and Catholics. George Weigel provides clear explanations of the Church's positions on such hot-button issues as the all-male priesthood, contraception, abortion, euthanasia, ecumenism, and salvation. Weigel writes with wit, style, and charity, and he never dumbs down the truth of the Catholic faith, which is the great strength of his book. I would recommend this book to curious Catholics and non-Catholics alike."
5,Excellent Book,"This book is a must for Catholis and non Catholics alike. The auther examines what it is to be a Catholic today,and how The Church Universal is slowing adapting to modernity. A fantastic read. Service was great as book arrived in very good condition on time.Gerry Walsh. Belfast."
3,Where is the gospel?,"Whether you like this book will depend on how central you believe the gospel is to Catholicism. This book struck me as an exercise in apologetics for Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Ratzinger. There was very little of the gospel to be found.I bought the book on the basis of the welcoming introduction, ""An invitation to come inside"", which echoed the warmth & welcome of most congregations I know. After a few chapters, though, I felt the doors were clanging shut behind me.The book is well-written and is a good exposition of the positions of the current leadership of the church and how some of its more controversial positions have developed. Taking that into account, I gave it 3 stars. However, because of its uncritical acceptance of an extremely culture-bound understanding of catholicism, without relating it to the touchstone of the gospels, please read with caution. Read the New Testament instead."
4,Fun exciting read,"I really enjoyed this book, definetely something i looked foward to reading at the end of my day! However the contrast in the characters luck surprises me a bit, as Devlin seems to get everything she wants, the incident with Ciara not really being in the same bad luck league as Maggie and Caroline's misfortune. But i have not read the other two books, so i cannot really judge. I loved the way Scanlan writes, when everything is going well for Caroline, it mucks up yet again, and a love the relationship between Luke and Devlin as a contrast to Maggie and Terry's! Loved this book, would recommend it!"
2,Factual Fiction,"I was amazed that a book could contain so many factual errors, such as the incorrect first names of noted theologians: Avery Dulles, for one. The use of the informal Frank for Francis Cardinal Spellman was laughable. The repetition of whole paragraphs and misspellings certainly brings into question whether there was a competant editor available or even spell check."
5,"A good, hard look at the Roman Catholic electoral process","Passing The Keys: Modern Cardinals, Conclaves, And The Election Of The Next Pope focuses upon a critically important piece of Catholic history - that of papal elections. Featuring extensive descriptions and study of the theological positions of Popes through John Paul II, Passing The Keys is one of the most complete and in-depth studies of this sensitive topic available to lay readers. Historian and author Francis Burkle-Young also takes a hard look upon debates that are directly affecting the priesthood and the Vatican today, over issues such as contraception and women as priests or bishops. Strongly commended reading for anyone interested in taking a good, hard look at the Roman Catholic electoral process that reveals who will be Pope, the man who speaks for God according to faithful Catholics the world over."
2,Please get the facts,"The times I perceived in accuracies of names and dates led me to believe that the publisher either was not serious or was a vanity publisher. No one but no one ever referred to francis Cardinal Spellman as ""Frank"". He had people at conclaves voting who had been dead. Amusing fiction but short on reality."
1,"shallow, misleading and blatently biased","This book redefines the term shallow with every page you read. It gives a ridiculous definition for terrorism that conveniently excludes acts of terror perpetrated by states. Somehow, only ""Islamic"" and ""leftist"" groups are called terrorist, with the unavoidable exception of the Oklahoma bombers. The book is riddled with misconceptions, false assumptions and non sequitur conclusions. It just offends your intelligence... not worth your time or money."
4,(un)plug & play!,"I liked my DI-614+, especially with a DWL-650+ PCMCIA card for my laptop at the time. I *literally* plugged it in the wall, plugged my DSL modem into the WAN port on the router, configured my desktop to use DHCP and plugged it into one of the four LAN ports, and I was online. Total time spent: less than one minute.The only SERIOUSLY major problem I have with the DI-614+ (rev A), is that if I'm connected to remove systems for FTP or SSH (I do web development) and leave my computer idle for a few minutes, the router kills the connection. I've logged almost a dozen calls to D-Link and tried every version of their software in an attempt to fix this but nothing has helped. That, however, was the ONLY problem I ever had with it. I eventually switched to a DI-714P which puts my printer on the LAN but I lose the 2X/4X data rates...Otherwise, the 614+ is a GREAT router."
5,Very simple setup,"Setup is a breeze, read the manual/quick install guide and you are all set.speeds are great, especially with the new 4x firmware upgrades.reliability is fine for me. i read that other people have had problems, but i have probably read just as many that said the've had no problems. i am int he no problems catagory. i can try and get online via my laptop wirelessly at any time and the router is up and running just fine. i have MAC filtering on and 128-bit WEP on."
5,Great for apartments,"I use this in my one bedroom, 750 square foot apartment and have over 90% signal strength no matter where I am. I keep it in the hall closet, in the middle of my unit, with the cable modem. The range is great. With this router in my unit on the third floor I can sit outside my building in the common area and still get reception of 60%. The reception is also great with my PDA that has built in wireless.I did notice the dowload rate does slow compared to a direct connection to the cable modem. However, you will ony see this when downloading large files and not with your daily web surfing or emailing."
5,New Firmware fixes some bugs,"I had some time settings issues and some weird reboots once a month or so, but since the new firmware release I haven't seen those problems anymore.The newest firmware was posted in march, but I didn't see it until about may. It works great now and I have to give it 5 stars because I don't have anything against it anymore. If I would have done a review like 5 months ago I would have gave it 4 stars.So my recommendation is to get the newest firmware and see if that doesn't fix any problems before you rate it low."
2,Had to be rebooted too often,"I bought this router and the D-link card. The set up was easy, and it worked fine for a while. But after every couple of days, I had to re-boot it. I found later that a firm ware upgrade would obviate the problem. But why should I need to upgrade firmware for the basic functionality.My recommendation would be to go for a tested 11 Mbps. Most people do not get internet connection over 1.5 Mbps anyhow so there is no bandwidth you are losing."
1,Disappointed,"I bought the 614+ with the intent of using the Nortel Contivity VPN client to connect to my company's network. Tech support told me it doesn't work with Contivity, but does work with the Extranet client. I was unable to get either the Contivity or the Extranet client to work. If you don't need to use a VPN to me this would not be a bad product, but don't expect much help from Tech Support. I think they get most of there recommendations from Internet news groups."
1,BAD VPN performance-very poor support,"I bought this router and is dropping VPN connection, this is very annoying. When I called D'Link, the support calls goes to some third party (not direct D-Link) I have to hold for more than 2 hrs to get coonected. The support guys does not have more than the config-guide knowledge. They refered the call to D-link special tech support. Never heard back from them. Returned the router to store. No option!"
1,Worst tech support ever,"By the time Tier 1 and Tier 2 tech support were done we had more problems than we started with. They fixed nothing and broke new things. Every time we called back they had lost the notes and had no record of the case numbers they'd given us, so we had to start all over. Tier 2 was even worse than Tier 1 -- gave up, made a few vague suggestions with no real direction and pushed us off the phone because he didn't know what to do next. He left us with our entire network down."
1,Good Price but doesn't work,"I got one [with a] rebate which is [a lot less] than a regular router. Setup is realatively smooth and it seemed work pretty well with the D-Link 650+ card (I wanted to keep it in the family).The routers wireless freezes every few hours and the router must be power cycled. This is with firmware 2.10 wich is relatively recent.I have since exchanged it with a linksys BEFW11S4 which is much more stable, has better range and works fine with the 650+ card."
4,Great product,Easy to set up but I did have to call tech support for some assistance with configuring it. Manual has little help for Mac users and the telephone tech support is worse when it comes to their knowledge of the Mac.
2,Recurring issues,... and have been struggling to get it working consistantly since. I have a Dell laptop with an internal truemobile wireless card. I think there are some compatability issues between the router and the card. I am constantly being disconnected briefly and reconnected.Several of my friends who have also tried this product with Cisco aironet cards have experienced similar problems. Tech support is clueless on how to fix this...
1,Encryption problem,"The WEP Encryption did not work for either the 128- or 64-bit encryption. The laptop and wireless card I used worked just fine on another wireless network I set up, so this router was the problem. I called up D-Link's not-too-helpful tech support and received the suggestion that I try typing the encryption key again."
4,"Excellent setup, sketchy details...","Everything about the D-Link AirPlus DI-614+ is perfect, minus one important fact: there is very little information on teaching a home user how to setup the firewall and encryption feature. The manuals are a joke and the D-Link website is useless. Trust me on this. However, every other fact about the router is excellent. I just wish D-Link would provide more information on actual set-up features..."
2,Another D-Link Product,"I had this setup for a total of 2 days before I was ready to throw it out the window (fortunately, I was able to send it back to Amazon.com). Setup is the pits, range is terrible since you have to be right next to it for the card to have a connection, and there are better, more affordable productions on the market (Netgear!!)Good luck to you if you are brave enough to try this."
1,Will never buy any D-link product,"This router is totally a junk. Wasted me so much time but won't work. Tech. support is useless. I have cable internet service. Without this router, the cable internet is fast and reliable. If I use this router in between my computer and the cable modem, the downloading speed got extremely slow, unbearable. Their tech support is useless. First time called they asked me to update the firmware. Still not work right. Second time called they sent me by email some info and ask me to call again if still have problem. It is so annoying. I will never use any Dlink product again."
1,A big stinking joke of a product and tech support,"How's this for a brilliant product: You build a wireless router with a 4-port switch that can only accomodate 1 EMAIL USER because the built-in server can only accomodate 1 IP address per port! So if the other three wired users want to use your email software, you are sh** out of luck.And it took 3 phone calls to tech support to get the question answered. One of them said after 30 minutes of playing around with router settings ""Maybe you should not have gotten this router."" Statement of the year.STAY AWAY FROM THIS ROUTER AND STAY AWAY FROM ALL D-LINK PRODUCTS"
1,This product did not work,I bought this router and could not get it to work. Then the Hardware failure light M2 came on and I requested a replacement. The replacement unit had the same problems and I returned that one too.
1,DO NOT BUY DLINK PRODUCTS: Horrible device & service,"I purchased this device for my family and I cannot believe the amount to time required to care and feed for this device. I have spent about 3 hours trying to keep it running properly. I will work for a day and then the wireless will just stop. The wired connection is fine. After it is reset, it works fine for another day or two. I have called technical support many times and the first level has less technical knowledge than a Circuit City sales person and level 2 is never accessible. Their phone lines are jammed with 30 minute+ wait times (level 1 35 minute wait, level 2 another 30+ minute wait time, then no resolution!). Wonder why the support lines are jammed? Their products stink.DO NOT BUY DLINK ANYTHING - you will regret it!"
2,"Awful tech support, VPN problems","Although this device worked out of the box with my laptop, it didn't take long to run into issues with other machines. The desktop machine I was trying to get it working with was running Win98 and wasn't getting an IP address from the router. After an hour or two on the phone with a somewhat rude tech-support person, he didn't know how to solve the problem and decided it was ""a Microsoft issue"" and gave me an 800 number for them.Eventually we decided just to reformat the machine and throw XP on, which was good for other reasons, and got the router working. At that point we learned that the router wasn't compatible with Novell VPN software, even though they claim they support it. After a 4 hour conference call with both Dlink and Novell (and the Novell guy knew more about the router than the Dlink guy) we still had no solution.The final solution: I went out and picked up a Netgear wireless router. Everything worked great, including VPN, on all boxes, in 10 minutes."
2,DHCPoop,While D-Link has improved thier response times to email questions thier answers are canned and unhelpful. For some bizzare reason my router keeps giving away all my DHCP IPs to the same unknown MAC address. I've turned off the wireless connection (so it's not getting in that way) and I can's imagine that it coming in from my modem. Even if I set the lease time for the IPs to a week it'll give this other MAC my leased IPs. MAC filtering for DHCP or DHCP that assigns IPs based on MACs would instantly solve all my problems. Other than that I'm at least midly satisfied with it although it does have some problems with AFS and ssh connections. I think I'm going to just use it as an access point and bring my old garbage linksys router to do all the DHCP and firewalling.
1,Bad router,Got 3 or 4 mb/s wireless and wired is 9 mb/s straight from the wall is over 20 mb/s. Only one user too
3,"Not too great , just okay - weak wireless signal","- This router is not too responsive, it takes 5-10 seconds or so for a request to get some replies. I don't know about other hardware router but it s[tin]ks comparing to my old hub+Linux as a router.- It took me almost an hour to set this up, it just doesn't work at first. I found out I have to switch my cable modem on and off for couple times AFTER the router is connected to it to get it working.- The wireless range [is very short] , I don't think it can handle more than 30 feet through couple walls."
1,Spotty connection,"This router is really horrible when it comes to consistancy. Others claim that the range is bad, but it's worse than just bad range. I can pick up an excellent signal, but it doesn't last very long. I can't maintain a conversation with windows messenger or do practically anything that requires a constant connection including streaming media, long downloads, etc.Do not purchase this item, you will regret it."
3,Works fine - just follow instructions,"As instructions stated, I installed the latest firmware for the router (which obviously is on their site) and followed instructions. NO BIG DEAL. IT WORKS!But if you are the type who think they know everything and don't take time to read instructions OR if you are not comfortable with computers, go with another brand because updating the latest firmware may not be for you.Signal strength fluctuates around 65% to 50% at 50 feet (my bedroom to the living room). Can't really notice a drop off in performance but maybe if I had a larger apartment :pIts an all around good cable router which allows me to check my email and surf the web without having to buy 100ft of Cat 5 cable."
1,Could not get PPPOE logon to work,"Could not get PPPOE logon to Earthlink to work. Tried upgrading the firmware based on an FAQ on the DLink support site. Finally gave up, returned it and purchased a Netgear unit. Got the Netgear up and running in no time.I would suggest either a Netgear or Linksys router, but no DLink products."
1,Don't waste your time,"Configured easy, worked with dwl800ap+ flawlessly... for about 20 minutes. M2 light came on, game over, back to the store. Read the reviews people.. these units are junk. Reinstalling Linksys with hi-gain antennae."
2,D-Link DI-614+ ...Returning to Store,"Out of the box, the wired connections worked fine...initially. Wireless worked ok downstream, but terrible upstream. Attempted to install firmware upgrade, but did not take...incompatible version message. Now, no connectivity either wired or wireless...admin browser not even available. Performed ipconfig /release then /renew...still no connection. This is more trouble than it is worth. I'm returning this to the store tomorrow...last D-link product I'll ever purchase!"
5,better than I thought...,"I expected to receive no more than 50% of the signal, because I read one comment that said, that the guy only could receive 0-30% of the signal. But when I intalled the D-link, I received around 90%, thats a lot, my net still really fast. I am using the iBook (Machintosh) and it works perfect. For me, it is the best wireless sytem ever. But I also bought the 800+ the range extander, it did not work well, this i wouldn't buy it."
2,good luck,"I bought this d-link 614+ last week and I am going to return back. This is just a nightmare to work on it. At my job I do alot of network troublshooting but this is a really a time consuming to make it to work on win XP Pro. 4 hrs attempt I was able to obtain dhcp ip address once and then I lost it when updated the firmware to ver.2.10. The only reason I updated because of thier Tech support suggested that if I update the firmware it will 100% resolve my issue next time. Well, It made it worse. After that I was not able to get the dhcp ip address from my ISP provider. Their own Tech support couldn't figure this out why its doing that. I tried on my three windows xp machines got the same result. Also their TEch support are not that great, they know few things and after that they tell you shut down the pc plus the router wait 5 min. if still on status configuration not showing ip address give us a call back.LOL, good luck another word he runs out of solution."
3,"Range is exaggerated, slows connection","Purchased with airplus card for speeds up to 22mbps, I am getting 0.6 mbps on the laptop with the card, and 1.2 mbps on the desktop unit. Doesn't work the way they say it does. Also, setup was difficult, had to download new drivers and firmware."
2,Great speed....but...,"I truly like the speed of the wireless connection, I compared it the Lynksys and saw a dramatic increase in speed using the dlink. I also like the 256 bit WEP. A couple of major issues I am very uncomfortable with is not being able to turn of the SSID without having major connectivity problems on the wireless side. The other issue is having to reboot the router every day to reset the wireless connection and be able to connect to the internet even when I can ping the router from my laptop."
1,Don't buy this piece of junk,"I got this device 3 month ago. First, I set it up very easy. Boom, it's up and running. However, one month later, it died suddenly. Simply just dead. No signal, no web interface, just silent (my hardware vsersion is A2). So I spent 1 hour with their tech support and managed to sent this thing back to dlink. During my waiting time, i got another one of this. And this new one doesn't work at all out of box. The m2 defective light is always on. I was angery and just returned it. This one is version B1 (with only one antenna).Couple days later, I got another one from dlink service center as a replacement of my first one. This one lasts only 2 days. Now it's dead again. The m2 defective light is solid on. I have to fight with their tech support again...I've never run into a product like this. Don't waste your time with this junk. Go get a linksys. They produce much more decent products."
2,D-Link Wireless Problems,"I own both this router and the Netgear MR-814. The Netgear wins hands down. I am quite experienced with both hardware and software, so my problems are not an issue of ignorance on my part. The D-Link simply has inherent problems in their wireless implementation. Hardwire connections worked fine, but when a wireless device was connected the router was plagued with dropped connections. On my cable line, losing my wireless connection was a norm. In a college dorm the situation was even worse - the D-Link often failed to allow wireless at all on the faster LAN connection. To make matters worse, the Netgear clearly demonstrated a stronger signal (60% Netgear to 40% on the Dlink). I recommend the Netgear MR-814 whole heartedly."
4,D-Link Airplus DI-614+,"I purchased the Dlink DI-614+ to network 2 computers to our cable modem. Installation was a little tricky but I was able to get tech help with a very short wait. I did have issues with a VPN, I was getting disconnected from the VPN about every 10 minutes. But this was resolved by downloading the latest firmware. This also was a little tricky, I didn't realize you download the firmware and just leave it on your desktop. Don't try to open it, it will load itself at about step 6. After that it has worked just great. I have it linked to a DWL-520+ wireless PCI adapter. I had problems with the adapter on the second computer, the mouse would hang up after about an hour or two of inactivity. This also was resolved by downloading the latest firmware for the DWL-520. The speed has been very good. No problems since the new firmware."
4,"New 2.10 firmware fixes MAC filter, no 22 Mbps linux support","New firmware corrects MAC address filtering problem, so now access is blocked to the LAN, not just the Internet. Was able to configure router to act as just a stand-alone access point, since I already have a firewall. (Use switch ports only, disable DHCP). I did not see a way to disable NAT, which most people would never care about anyway. One thing to watch out for, MAC filtering applies to both wireless and LAN connections. I enabled MAC filtering, only allowing one ""fake"" MAC address that I put in, and suddenly could no longer connect to the management console through the local LAN. Had to reset to factory defaults (hold reset 10 seconds), to get back into the box. Also, no Linux driver for the DWL-650+ card which is disappointing, so no 22 Mbps to Linux. I had to buy a Linksys WPC11 which worked fine with Linux and the Di-614+"
5,I intalled it and then it just started working!,I greatly appreciate it when I am able to install any kind of computer related hardware and have it work the way I want withing 20 minutes of opening the box. That's exactly what this D-Link did for me.I am able to browse the Internet anywhere in my home with my laptop and a DWL-650+ plugged into it. The speeds I get are perfect since I really don't notice a difference in surfing the Internet while on my laptop (wireless) then on my desktop (wired). I am very happy with my purchase.
1,Still flaky ... Firmware ...,"..., and I am giving the manufacturer [time] to produce firmware that solves my problems. Otherwise, I return it. Why? An 802.11b (WI-FI) compliant device must be able to work with other compliant devices, regardless of brand. This one doesn't in my experience. A router should not reset itself randomly.For one, I have already upgraded the firmware twice (1.1 to 2.0f, 2.0f to 2.03), and it is still flaky. Two, I have been unable to get a Cisco Aironet 340 PCMCIA Card to Associate (one that works on other networks). Three, a Compaq WL100 PCMCIA Card will Associate, but, it has obtained an IP address only once in over 100 Associations! Four, the router appears to reset itself, irregardless of configuration; this means that even my wired PC connections lose access to the WAN. This latter has nothing to do with my ability to configure the unit. ..."
5,"Fast, reliable and slick.features",Terrific price/performance compared to other802.11b wireless routers.Got this with my 650+ card and both workedgreat out of the box. The router isreal easy to set up (no CD needed) and thewired LAN was ready to go in minutes.Wireless config was also fast and easy. Worksgreat even in a mix with 11Mbps 802.11b devices.The caveats:Early firmware updates were sort ofglitchy. One disappointment was thatDLINK took out the ability to generatepassphrases on the router and didn'tdocument it anywhere. That's OK ifyou don't mind rekeying these orcutting and pasting from a file.Fortunately these are easy to back out.Support response is not particularlyfast.One the other hand the latest updateswork well and I've been able to usethe router and adapter in combinationother older products from Linksys andUSRobotics with good results.
5,A Very Stable and Reliable Wireless Router at a Low Price,"Lots of features and the 22Mbps speeds on this router is what initially drew me to it. And what do you know, high speeds and a wide range of features is exactly what it gives me. I am more than pleased with this wireless router. I was able to keep my existing 3 PC wired network and have plenty of room to expand my network wirelessly without having to run wires every where. The range on this router alone covers my entire home and then some. I get good to great signal whether I am upstairs or downstairs with the router being downstairs. The features are great because I can shut off my kids' access to the Internet after 10pm on school nights without having to manually unplug them or tell them anything. So even when I am away or out for the night my kids wont be staying up late or getting into any trouble on the Internet. Very useful. I also have this currently working with my XBox to allow game play over the Internet, which is very entertaining."
2,Not recommended,"I purchased this wireless router hoping to replace my 3 years old LinkSys router. However, after playing with it for several hours, I decided to return it because of the following (using firmware 2.18):1. MAC filtering: Can't make it for wireless only. Once it is enable, it is for both wireless and wired network. This is the MOST annoying part. I mean, why do I want to enable MAC filtering for my wired network???2. Router configuration: Very primitive comparing to my old LinkSys.3. Enable/Disable Wireless: It didn't really disable the wireless network(physically). It shoulded be called ""allow/deny all"" access instead. Once the wireless is ""disabled"", it does still broadcast the SSID.4. No way of disabling SSID broadcast for security reasons.Finally, I have to give DLink credit for making upgrade firmware so easy (Web base), which is a big improvement comparing to my old linksys router."
2,"Flakey operation, poor range","I've not been terribly impressed with this box. DHCP has been flakey at best (about half the machine in the house have required manual IP selection--AT THE LEAST), and the range of the router is ridiculously poor. At my fiancee's old apartment, my TiBook could connect to the wireless networks of two of her neighbors, at my band's rehearsal space, I can get to the next apartment no problem, I've been able to war drive. With this base station, I'm 15 feet away from the base station and can't get a stable connection.Tech support, at least, is reasonably helpful, but I would definitely consider a different wifi router if I were doing it all over again."
5,"No problem with various connection adapters, VPN from day 1","The router is very easy to install and configure. I originally had a concern that VPN might not work. It's to my relief that this router works like a charm with VPN connections. Also the firmware seems to be robust enough that I haven't had a need to reboot the router for a couple of months now. I wouldn't say that on some other routers, wired or wireless. I have wireless notebook, iPaq with WiFi capability, and PC with wireless adapter in my house. They all connect via this router without any problems."
2,Sketchy Wireless Connection,"The wired connections worked just fine, and the wireless strength was very good. However, data transfer with a wireless connection worked very poorly. Requests to websites would take much longer than with a wired connection, and very frequently would not go through at all. We returned this after a few days in search for a wireless router that actually worked.We do, however, like that there is no limit to the number of port forwards you can define."
1,Warning - Do not buy!,"This product is horrible. I should have listened to the other reviews. While setup is easy, performance [stinks]. This router (combined with the 650+ card) slowed my Internet access to a crawl. Even after up dating the firmware it was as slow as molasses. Now that I have disconnected it - I am at full speed again. The worst part is D-Link service. Half hour on the phone, 3 emails - all no response (promise 24 hour turn around on the email.) It is clear that D-Link released this product before it was ready."
3,STILL KICKIN AFTER 3 YEARS,"My 2 Antenna version is still working after 3 years. I rarely will have to reboot it. The wireless functions work ok too, however there are newer routers out there that have a lot more features. Speaking of features, most of the configuration settings don't work. For instance, the Port 80 remote management, never worked right from the get go.I would like to upgrade my router to one with more wireless security features however since this baby still works like a champ with my desktop, I'm going to keep it and run ethernet cables throughout my house to the other computers and not set up a wireless network.If you can still find this router out there, you may want to get it for it's solid stability but as mentioned, don't get your hopes up too high with the browser based configuration settings.DAN"
2,Smokin' router,"Easy to set up, worked well for a while. It stopped working, which it did periodically, so I unplugged and plugged it back in (a common fix) but this last time it started smoking. No more router. That's why it's inexpensive!"
1,Piece of ....,"Bought the D-Link AirPlus Wireless Laptop Networking Kit .... Contains the DI-614+ wireless router and the DWL-650+ laptop card. The box says Installation in 3 Easy Steps. Yeah right! B.S. It took me 3 hours to get the wireless internet connection to work on my laptop. I then realized I could no longer connect to the internet with my desktop. After waiting one hour on the phone for tech support, the technician was able to fix the problem on my desktop connection.But guess what, the next day it would no longer work. Tried to re-install all over again. Forget it, there is no way I could make it work. No internet connection with the laptop or the desktop. Spent 5 hours trying to fix it, nothing works. I will return this..."
4,"good product, but not as advertised","I'm using DI-614+ and DWL-650+. It's very easy to setup, but you need to install driver (without the card in your laptop) first. Otherwise, windows won't see the device. This is a step backward compare to other PC wireless card.Speed is another thing that these products don't work the way they are supposed to work. I can get only up to 11 Mbps instead of 22 Mbps."
1,serious problems getting unit to work with my xp system,"After four hours of working with the set up program, plugging and unplugging the cables attached to the router, the cable modem and my computer, and waiting on line to get to tech support (in one case a full half hour), I decided to return the system. I spoke with three individuals in D-link's technical assistance, all of whom tried to be helpful, but even after following their directions internet access was excruciatingly slow when the unit was in place. My system is a brand new computer with an xp operating system. It is possible the unit was defective, or so I was advised by the last person I spoke to at D-link. Others have been pleased with the router, but based on this experience and my efforts at installing their 520+ pci card, I give them a one star review."
3,"Basic functions are great, but falls short after that","I was up and running out of the box within 5 minutes like most others. However, if you are looking to customize to your network, that's where the problems start. In short, bad to no documentation for anything beyond the wizard setup such as custom router vs. bridge options, WEP flakiness, multiple 1 to 1 NAT doesn't seem to be a choice, firewall is a joke to administer, tech support is a handful of robots, and non-existent connections where it once was working fine, with no remedy other than rebooting. Not a bad item for the price, but the built-in functions do not work 100% and are buggy. Firmware didn't help me and in fact seem to make the dead connections worse. Most opinions I've read regarding positive feedback seems to be on the ease of setup. I think the smiles will wear off if trying to integrate with exisiting multi-tiered networks."
4,Talented singer/songwriter,"Although this album is not as good as ""tricks with pretty words"",it is a solid effort especially ""missed the ring,overrated,urban infestation and want to be your dream"".Lisa can write and sing every type of music out there with a range unparalleled .She sings with passion and energy that comes from doing what you love to do,sing."
1,"Man, I feel sick!","I always sit and ponder the reason why anyone would give their permission to this! Why on earth would you let a bunch of terrible band's cover your music on a CD that will be sold to the public? I had to give it one star,only for the fact that they wont let me give it zero star's!! Buy it if you want. But do not say I did not warn you."
1,RAPHAEL MY HISTORIA.,"I AM A HUGE RAPHAEL FAN, EVER SINCE I WAS A KID MY DAD WOULD LISTENED TO RAPHAEL ON THE WEEKENDS.THAT WAS ALMOST 25 YEARS AGO. AND I STILL LIKE RAPHAEL'S SONGS VERY MUCH. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT ONE OF HIS BEST. HE TRIED TO UPDATE SOME OF HIS VERY BEST SONGS THAT HE RECORDED IN THE 60'S AND 70'S AND FAILED MISERABLY. IF YOU ARE A FAN THE BEST ALBUM TO GET IS: RAPHAEL YO SOY AQUEL A TWO DISC COLLECTION OF HIS VERY BEST WORK. AND ALL OF THE SONGS HAVE BEEN REMASTERED.THERE FOR YOU GET THE BEST SONGS WITH THE BEST SOUND."
5,Darling Drapes Round Crib Bedding Set,"This set is gorgeous!!! It makes my babies crib and room look like a dream room. It gives the room a very soft look. I just love this set. It was a pleasure dealing with aBaby and their fast delivery was a real bonus. Shop aBaby's products, all their products are top quality."
5,The perfect white blouse!,"This white, no iron long sleeved shirt is the perfect blouse to wear with something as simple as a black skirt/pants or with an evening skirt. This is the ""go to"" white shirt for anyone's wardrobe. A must own! In fact, I own TWO of these. And it is truly a no-iron shirt - it looks brand new everytime I take it out of the dryer."
4,"Non-essential...HA, don't believe it.","Shabert and Erlich do a great job of explaining how this little amino acid is sooooo essential. They are brave to include in their title the words ""non-essential"" because some people don't read thoroughly and might miss out on a good, thorough explanation of how important this glutamine really is. After gaining a better understanding via this book, I did a search on-line for someplace that sold the product. I found iHerb to offer the best service and several choices of glutamine. Now, I am including glutamine in my diet for more balance in my amino-acid intake."
5,Just like the cover says... THE ULTIMATE TRANCE COMPILATION,"It's nice to see that what when people promise something, they deliver, and that is definitely the case with this album. While some songs sound familiar (Australia, Outside World, It's a Dream), it's ok to listen to them because they are so great! I highly recommend this album to anyone and everyone's that is into Progressive Dream Techno with beautiful, catchy, inspirational and invigorating melodies... If you like ""Dream Dance"" Compilations, you'll really love this album!! I can't wait till the second volume comes out!!"
3,Year A?!?!?,"This year is Cycle A and I had to obtain it from Amazon.UK... Since these are only good every 3 years, it would have been nice to have had the one for this year available. Other than that, I can't review Year B or C until we use them in the coming years.Just looking through them, they are a great resource to involve children in worship as it is happening."
4,Starting to develop their signature sound here,"Though still at a more formative stage of their career at the time that this was made, if you listen closely you can hear the rich melodicism that would be the trademark of their classic 80s material starting to emerge. Not the completely listenable album that Just Gets Better With Time or Toast To The Ladies is, but still something that both Whispers aficionadoes and fans of good 70s soul should check out, especially for the beautiful 6 minute long ""message"" ballad ""You're Only As Good As You Think You Are""."
4,"Intense, early archival African pop","Banjo-led tunes with instrumentation that is disarmingly similar to American old-timey music, though very different stylistically. Not much is known about these musicians -- not even which West African tribe they may have came from. The recordings were made in England, and released in 1929-1930 as 78s on the Zonophone label. Although it all begins to sound the same after a while, there are some interesting aural effects on tracks #18-20, where the banjo and guitars are completely out of tune with each other, yet the song goes on, creating its own, off-kilter musical logic. The effect is disconcerting -- even a bit creepy, in a music-box kind of way."
1,Overhead drywall cutouts kill this tool,"Baught this to cutout electrical outlets in drywall.Worked great on the walls.When cutting out overhead, drywall dust goes into the vents and destroys the motor.This happened to my first one, so I returned it.Then it happened to the second one right away.Anyone else have this problem ???"
5,great for use with crafts or whatever!,i use this for my crafts and it works great! it's easy to use and finding heads or attachments are easy.
2,Good but they forgot the wrench,The rotary tool is awesome. The reason I gave this item 2 stars is because they forgot to send me the wrench.
5,Black and decker can be used with Dremel accessories,"I been filling my retirement days making little items around the house, like jig saw puzzle tables, shelves and so on. I have the Dremel 4000, 300 and accessories. The accessories include the Dremel router, router table, and drill press (work station). Instead of changing rotory tools I decided to buy two more and leave them attached to the accessory tool. I bought two Black and Decker RTX's. They do work with the Dremel equipment, you just have to set up the tool before you mount it in the drill press and router table. I have it all set, to start plug it in, to stop unplug it.The B&G; tool seem to have more power, costs less, and works with the Dremel system. A great tool for small projects."
4,"My first ""rotary tool""","I had put off buying a ""rotary tool"" genericly known as a ""Dremel"" for a while.I realized that I could use one when my son had to do his Pinewood Derby car this year.This tool works well. I bought it based on reviews of the Dremel tools not lasting very long and other favorable reviews of this unit.I just bought a kit to sharpen my chain saw blade and my lawn mower blade. I'm looking forward to using them."
1,Not very durable,"I used this tool only 4 or 5 times when the pin to lock the chuck to change bits sheared off. Now I am faced with either disassembling the tool and trying to manufacture a new pin, or just discarding the tool altogether. I am disappointed with Black and Decker for this tool and would not recommend it for anyone who plans to really use it. It's just built too fragile. I won't buy another for sure. Should have gone with a Dremel brand."
3,ok- but has some issues,"This product is ok. It does the job for a short period of time. I use mine alot and Ive gone through 2 in 4-5 months, with the new ones starting to go out as well. I would recommend these for someone who only uses them occasionally, and in a dust free environment. Once dust gets in the motor the dremmel quits and is no good."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered 2 units of the RTX from Amazon. While the first unit worked well, with minimal vibrations, and a high torque, the second unit was a great disappointment. Speed was intermittent, torque below par, was very noisy for a small thing. Since I live in the Philippines and the cost of shipping the product is more than the cost of the product itself, I decided to just place an order for two new units of >>>the DREMEL MOTO TOOL! I will not buy the B&D; RTX ever again!Because of this one incident, I will be wary of buying any Black and Decker product from now on."
2,OK for hobbiest - but doesn't stand up to daily use,"Heats up very quickly under load meaning it's only good for small jobs, or you let it cool down often. Collet is a separate piece from the motor armature and supported with only one bearing. This bearing quickly wears and run-out on the collet gets excessive meaning your tool now wobbles. The dremel is a better built tool if you use it alot."
3,not bad for this price but dial sucks,"I own a dremel 300 and 4000. However, the RTX has more torque than both. The dremel attachments all work with the rtx but the rtx has about slightly less thread than the dremel 4000. All as a result, XPR attachments will sit securely, but not fully in unless you grind off the tabs on the XPR attachments. Thus, I can abuse the RTX with all the dremel attachments and not worry (at this price).My biggest complaints are the chuck and dial to change the speed. It is hard to turn on a brand new one. They should have made the wheel wider. but then again, how often do I you change speeds? I use highest most of the time.Anyway, this is real competition for dremel.Lastly, I wanted to add the the Dremel chuck (recommended) and the XPR attachments will work fine on this tool. For a better fit, you can grind off the XPR tabs."
2,"Good at first, doesn't last",This is my 2nd of this exact model in a year. I will NOT buy this brand and model again. We use these in our grooming shop to trim dog nails. They are not overworked at all. First one worked great at first and just quit a few months later.I purchased another in February and this one quit working today. It has only been used about 4 months!Edited to add...Just got off the phone with Black and Decker. They are shipping me out a replacement free of charge. Hopefully this replacement will last more than 4 months.Edited to add again.... Replacement arrived 6/21/2012. Today is 8/28/2012 and it has developed a switch issue. It won't stay on unless you hold the switch forward in the on position.... Going back to Dremel brand.
1,Works but falls apart. No replacable brushes,"I purchased the same model shown in the Amazon picture. The tool did work. I also purchased a Dremel accessory, a tile cutting tool with 1/8"" shank. It did cut tile, but the B&D rotary tool stopped working after cutting tile. The tile dust was too much for it. I'd bet the same thing would happen if you used it to do a lot of sanding or paint stripping. The tool has no replaceable brushes for the motor, so after they give out, you have to throw away the rotarty tool. Dremel has replaceable brushes on some models if not all. They also sell the brushes. I also purchased a Craftsman rotary tool and it had replaceable brushes on it, but it gave out paint strippping and was only one speed. The B&D does fit on the Dremel drill press after removing the screw on collet as it has the proper threads."
4,rotary tool for pet nail grooming,"We use a rotary tool for trimming the toenails on our dogs. We've gone through several brands and models, and this one seems the best combination of easy to hold, relatively quiet, and reasonable cost. They usually last about as long as they are warrantied for (2 years I think). In a less dusty service, they might last quite a bit longer. We quit using Dremel many years ago because they cost a lot more, usually only come with a lot of expensive accessories, and don't last any longer."
1,worked for one use,"I cut 13 holes in 1/2"" sheet rock then it would not work any more. I tried to contact Black&Decker for a replacement on there web site with no luck."
3,"It worked, but...","Good news:As I hoped, I successfully (but really slowly) cut off 6 ends from a steel wire shelf.I used a Dremel cutting wheel, which has exactly same shaft size as the grinding accessory that came with the RTX.Bad news:1. The speed selector is very difficult to rotate; initially, I thought it was locked somehow.2. I found it very difficult to remove the rotary tool from collet. The collet got stuck inside of the round ""nut"" that holds it in place. The collet should have something on it to allow it to be removed easier.Where can I find a better collet?If I had known about these problems, I would have considered a Dremel rotary tool instead.I will keep the RTX-B, because of its low price (I won't need very often)."
5,Great dremel replacement,"I am a professional dog groomer. The dremel mighty mite would only keep a charge for ten minutes. This very inexpensive electric dremel works great for dogs' nails. The equivelent dremel is easily twice the cost, with brushes that need replacing too! So far it has been very reliable. The hanger that attaches to it has fallen off on occasion and is very annoying, but the rotary tool itself is very powerful and always works. The speed settings do have more variety than advertized too; that's a big plus."
4,Nice Tool,"I was a little hesitant about purchasing anything Black & Decker, since my experience has shown that they can put out some cheaply made tools. However, this little rotary tool abolishes that thought. With the exception of my speed dial being a little off axis and thus requires a bit of force to turn it (that's why it's 4 instead of 5 stars), this unit is very well made. I believe it to be more heavy duty than my old Dremel which seized up on me. I have used it for more precision inlay work, as well as cutting light box holes in drywall. Time will tell, but I am going to purchase a least one more of these, and I think that says a lot. If my next one has a speed dial that is more in alignment, then I'll bump this up to 5 stars."
5,Everyone should own one!,"I purchased mine from Amazon a couple of years ago. I was undertaking a huge project, my wife and I were planning our wedding and we used tool and a few bits to actually engrave our names and wedding dates on over 100 glass tea light holders. I have to say that this holds up very well, the low speed was perfect for starting a ""trail"" in the stencils; once we had a decent ""trail"" the max speed settings was able to finish with extreme detail, depth, and precision. I also use this to maintain my dogs nails, she is a german shepherd-pitbull mix (very thick nails), this is even gentle enough for her. I highly recommend this rotary tool; my next project is wood letters for my sons room, will probably add LEDs to them. I used this consistently for 3-4 hours day 5-7 days out of the week and it never bogs down and still works as if it were right out of the box"
4,Easy To Use,This is a very good tool that does no bog down even when pressing down hard. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the 5 tools it came with are just round sand paper and a holding fixture. The picture on the site shows different tools so I assumed it came with them ( My Bad ). I bought a 220 piece tool assortment so I have all the grinding and sanding tools I need. The three speeds are also a big plus and the easy change flip switch is great!
4,Tool-less chuck tightening,"The chuck can be tightened by hand, altho one can still use the small Dremel wrench or (simply) a pair of pliers. I like its 3-speed functionality, altho it seems you can stop the dial between speed settings for VARIABLE speed. Dremel doesn't make a 3-speed corded tool.I've owned a few of these tools and have used them extensively. They're fairly durable, but wear out eventually and you cannot open the casing (unless you get a special screwdriver) to service it. I'm glad Amazon still carries it, since Walmart no longer does. Black and Decker says it's been discontinued, so this review may become obsolete soon.It handles all the Dremel bits, which is good since I never saw B&D; rotary bits anywhere. I bought two recently and fear I won't be able to replace them in a couple years... but I'll just buy a Dremel then... no big deal."
3,Three Speed Dial is SO STIFF!!!,"Has anyone had a problem rolling the speed wheel on this tool, with your thumb? I can barely move mine from low to medium to high. Is this the standard for the tool, or do I have a malfunctioning speed wheel."
5,black & decker rotary tool RTX-B,"WOW this tool has some power. Almost to much. I think you could cut down a small battle ship with it. I haven't used it that much, but when i did it worked like a champ. So will see how long it lasts. If it only lasted a year(and I'm hoping for more) I don't think you could go wrong, not at this price. Check it out. An than buy one and you will be saying WOW."
5,Next best thing to a Dremel,"If you like saving money buy this product instead of a Dremel. If you want a good value, buy the one with the 30 bits and clamps. A keyless chuck is also going to be needed to use different bits. Dremels can be pricey, you can see how the cost can add up quick. You can still use all Dremels bits with this product."
4,B & D 3-speed rotary tool,"I'm very satisfied with the product, and have recommended it to friends.The price was more than reasonable too. I would definitely buy it again."
3,ehh,"This tool works great, when you can actually get it to let go of the bit if you need to swap it out. It says they are easy to get out, well yes, provided you use a pair of pliers... I have a bit stuck in the tool at the moment, been trying to get it out for oh...45 mins. Probably going to have to dismantle the whole tool....works great as a dremmel tool, sucks at ""quick release"" bits."
1,My country uses 220V and you sent me a product that works on 110V,If you from countries that use 220V then DONT buy electric products from Amazon. Their products are 110v and now i have a product that i CANT use.
