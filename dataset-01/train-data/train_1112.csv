3,Very Good,"Not exactly what I expected, but a very good pictorial guide. This would be a valuable asset to the amatuer buyer of antiques."
3,Well Organized Content,"Though this book is well organized, easy to review and offers an extensive selection of marks and stamps, it is still somewhat limited in its content. I had bought this book to do some research; unfortunately, I did not find what I was looking for on a few items. Nonetheless, I still would recommend this book for its well-organized content."
5,Pictorial Guide to Pottery & Porcelain Marks,Nicely laid out book with lots of information and pictures of Pottery & Porcelain and their Marks and contains a comprehensive reference list for further reading.
2,The Healing Power of Herbs,"The Healing Power of Herbs: The Enlightened Person's Guide to the Wonders of Medicinal PlantsThere were quite a lot of common herbs that were not represented in this book. Also, the information given per each herb was not very complete. I was rather dissapointed in this book."
5,this is the best!,I have owned this book for 5 years. I still use it on a regular basis. Its one of the best books on basic herbs you can buy. I can't even begin to count how many times it has saved us from a trip to the doctor. Get this book if you want to keep yourself healthy naturally.
1,Confuso,"Lo encontre muy confuso, complicado para entender y la verdad es interesante pero no el mensaje que quiso llevar la autora no lo capte. He leido muchos libros de la Cabala y este no lo recomiendo."
1,PHONEY,"If these are the Clancy Brothers singing, then I'm the Lord Mayor of Dublin!Clancy sing-alikes!! I should have guessed when I saw the price."
1,Lacrymorse,"This is the most boring collection of Irish music I have ever heard. Mostly military songs with a snare drum and a spare penny whistle peeping out. There's a couple semi inspired drinking songs and a couple pretty ballads with milk toast guitar accompaniment. I have been in Pubs in Ireland (Dingle Pennisula/Dublin) and they would not be singing most of this stuff now or then. It would put everyone to sleep. This is just not my cup of tea, nothing rousing, nothing to raise your glass of stout for... For soggy purests only..."
3,A Quick Overview of Irish Music,"The Cd is disappointing because it does not do the Clancy Bros justice -- they have recorded everyhting here in better, longer versions. It doesn't do Irish music justice -- most of the songs are shorten versions. That understood, I sort of like the Cd. When I just want to listen to a bit of kewl Irish music and not be distracted from doing something else, this Cd makes for pleasant back ground noise!"
1,only for the most ardent fan of this group,I was disapointed This is not great both from a vocal or instrumental point of view.
2,Get the reissued versions!!!!!,"Just to clarify the music...These tracks come from the first two albums of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. They are called ""Rising of the Moon"" and ""Come Fill Your Glass With Us"" These tracks were recently reissued on Rykodisc, restored and remastered. Frankly, they sound AMAZING! This complation has terrible sound quality, and the recordings sound like they were copied from an old LP. Don't settle for this ugly sounding reissue, go and check out the remastered versions. Unless you are on a serious budget, get the other discs. Combined, they cost about twice what this costs, but IT IS WORTH IT!"
2,Comic babble-on,"After a strong, and ghost-written, opening, the book degenerates into Bruce's own ramblings. Fact is, stream of consciousness really only works if one IS conscious, and all the drugs Bruce was on -- purely therapeutic, he explains -- blew his mind out well before he sat down to write.And, come on, anyone who thinks Steve Allen was hip clearly has to be brain-addled."
3,What an imagination!,"Lenny had a ghost writer complete the first two chapters before he, in his inimitable manner, decided he could do it better. The results are a mostly ficticious review of his wild imagination.But don't take my word for it. You wanna meet the real (albiet posthumous) Lenny Bruce? Goldman's LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LENNY BRUCE cuts away the crap and exposes who he really was.Hey, I'm a Lenny fan since 1958 and idolized the guy, drug habit or not. I have all but one of his LPs (the extremely rare court case ramblings isn't part of my collection) and what he had to say was truly great.However, what he was really like ain't in his autobiography but can be reflected through the words of Honey and Goldman.'Nuff said."
3,Stand-up put down in words,"I enjoyed this book for its humor, adding context to Lenny Bruce's life, and philosophical critiques of censorship. I wasn't crazy about Bruce's decision to write as though he was telling stand-up, by breaking from narration to do third-person character voices, endless tangents, and other little quips that sort of distract from whatever story he's telling. Also, much of his language is slang half a century old, which is both amusing and confusing. If you want to know more about Lenny Bruce, this is your book. If you want something guaranteed to make you laugh, this may or may not be right for you."
4,Dig Lenny,"Lenny Bruce was the pioneer of American comedy, as well as the First Ammendment's most humorous martyr. Read his evolution from one-lining Catskill comedian to town crier of truth and injustice. If you like George Carlin, Dennis Miller, or Bill Hicks, read the book by the man who influenced them all."
4,Rebel with a cause,"Lenny Bruce, though a profligate by some standards, comes across as a persevering and sincere man in his own way. His agenda is to break the convention and to push the envelope of the society through humor, to uncover the hypocrisy and to bring out the truth from beneath the sheets. Still, relative to the title, and contrary to Bruce's reputation, I found the book's humor less than satisfying."
4,Camera Batteries,"I bought the batteries for a Grandson. He has been busy taking pictures with his camera and hasn't complained, so I have to assume that they are working properly."
4,Nikon camera battery,It is nice to have one charged and in the camera and the other one in the camera case ready to use.
4,"Not the best, but worth the price!","Biggest complaint about rechargeable batteries is ""What if they go dead?"" Well for this price, you have 2 back ups. They don't last as long as Canon's, but they cost much less so you can buy 2."
2,the size is...,Somehow it does not fit nicely into the battery charger...It is very tight and hard to put in and pull out... I think it is a defect. I do not like that. It is made in China. I shall look for of other brands...
4,great replacements,Just got them to replace the aging ones that I bought over 7 years ago with the camera - hopefully they will perform as well as the others.Can't beat the price as the others had cost many times that amount but that was back in the early 2000s.
4,Nikon Camera EN-EL1 Battery Twin-pack Purchase,"The product arrived well within the time period. The EN-EL-1 batteries appear to work satisfactorily, but not enough time has transpired to determine how well they hold their charge. The transaction was most satisfactory, but the value of the product cannot be determined until the duration of the charge has been determined. In other words, the process of purchasing the product through Amazon worked very well; I just cannot say whether the batteries are of value."
4,Camera Battery,"Whew! The camera is nearly ten years old, so I was really concerned I would have to buy a new camera when I realized the batteries I had would not take or hold a charge. It's still a great camera - and thanks to these new batteries, I'll keep on clicking!"
3,disposable commercialism - 50% good,It is a good thing this is a 2-pack because one battery went dead after my first use. The one that works is good and would get 5 stars. The one that does not would get none. At least they are so cheap that it is still cost effective to buy the one.Don't you love disposable commercialism?
4,Jackaroo the Review,"Jackaroo is a very well written book.It is interesting and exciting!!It is obvious that Cynthia,the author, spent a lot of time and energy on small details.These small detais help paint a clear picture of what is happening in the story while reading it.This book is wonderful!!I can't wait to read On fortunes Wheel.It has to be more interesting than Jackaroo, because Jackaroo leaves you hanging in the end when the Earl tries to marry the innkeepers daughter. but still I could read this book over and over & not get tired of it.It tells you alot about life & culture in the middle ages.If you what a good book to read I would really reomend this book!!"
5,A must read,"I read this book after I read On Fortune's Wheel and it made understand a lot better some details of the book, of course it is meant to be read prior to OFW. The book is great. If you love fantasy, adventure and a bit of romance, read this book."
5,Interesting start for a great saga,"I've now read all the books in the Kingdom saga, and I must say I enjoyed it very much. The great thing is, all the books are connected, and you can see character traits from previous books in the new characters! Jackaroo is an interestingly deep look at the life of the Innkeeper's daughter, and how her voyage to help people becomes very dangerous. She is a strong and good character, and the supporting characters have depth. I especially liked her relationship with her brother, who seems bratty at first but becomes better, and their servant, who turns out to be more than he appears to be."
5,My favorite book,"I read the other reviews complaining about the lack of actionin the book, and have to strongly disagree with them. It's sad thatpeople prefer mindless ""action"" to finely-crafted characters, engaging plots, vivid settings, and meaningful messages, all of which this book has in full.These are the reasons that this book is one of my favorites. Voigt has written a classic tale, and the messages contained within this book are applicable not only in the vivid medieval-type setting where Jackaroo takes place, but in our time as well. Gwyn is a genuine heroine, in a way that anybody can be a hero: she knows what is right and makes an effort to bring the rightness about. Burl is a wonderful compliment to Gwyn.And if you absolutely MUST have your action, there's enough of it towards the end of the book to satisfy anybody. Give this book a try, it's an amazing example of the potentials of the genre."
2,One of Voigt's worse books.,"Cynthia Voigt is one of my favorite authors, but this book was not her best. Jackaroo is very boring at some parts of this book. I read this book for a summer reading book report and halfway through the summer I decided that I needed to choose a different book to read. Another thing that was bad about the book was that the pages were horribly bound together and as soon as I started reading the book, they began to fall out. If you do read this book, try to get it in the hardcover edition, because the book is not worth trying to balance all the pages as you read it. The only person who I would recommend reading this book is a person who really likes fantasy and andventure books, otherwise, I would skip it."
1,The last 20 or so pages was all the action.,"I did not like the book Jackaroo for many reasons. One i did not like it because the author seemed to go on and on and on about the simplest things some times distorting the picture in my head. Two the last 20 or so pages was all the action the rest was just detailes. I think Cnthia Voight should rewrite Jackaroo and make it much, much more interesting."
1,Incoherent tedium,I have merely one suggestion--read this book if you have insomnia. It will cure it immediately.
4,Agatha Webb,"Not as tedious as some other works by Anna Katharine Green. While it also wasn't as amusing, it was a good story and kept me up late reading. I was surprised the whole way through. One of her best."
2,Not much to say,"As the title of my review proclaims, I don't have much to say about ""The Night of the Iguana."" The setting and the characterization are compelling, but the story itself never really ""grabbed"" me. The two characters whose interaction most interested me -- Larry Shannon and Hannah Jelkes -- engage in only one truly in-depth conversation, one which is fascinating and revealing and left me wanting more. But there was no more, and by the time I read the last lines of the play, I felt as though Williams had abandoned his characters and his reader just when things were getting interesting."
3,It's Ok,"The best thing about this book is the setting, a resort in Mexico. Shannon is a somewhat compelling character as I like contradictions. He is a priest but he can't help seducing underage girls all over the place. Otherwise, just ok."
4,Not A Bad Flick,This wasn't the scarriest movie out there but it was entertaining enough. Not a bad performance from the new comer Patrick Campion. I would recommend this movie for a night on the couch flick.
3,"AMITYVILLEish ,Florida-Flavored Haunted Real Estate","VACANT HOUSEvacanthouse.angelfire.comSo, You've moved into a new home and friends wanna throw a séance-themed house warming.Was worried at first that this would be a Talking Heads scene with "" I'm a killer because..."" BUT, Soon switched to a WHO IS THE KILLER thriller.The house is haunted because a real estate agent gave in to the seduction by a `door to door hooker' with Vacant House fetish.This tragedy has given to a murder coverup, And definitely no escrow declaration...VACANT HOUSE is haunted !Ray & Migdalia Etheridge have done it again, With no budget they still tell a taut story with minimal effects.One of the oddest things about their productions is FLORIDA scenery, Seriously a few paces from VACANT HOUSE location and it's like a jungle."
1,"Twin Size, Huge Disappointment","I hate leaving bad feedback but I am extremely disappointed with the mattress topper that was sent. I ordered 2 of the same exact mattress toppers in twin xl throughout the past 4 years, and were very satisfied. I ordered 2 more of the same mattress toppers in twin and this is not even memory foam. It feels just like regular, cheap foam - this is not at all dense, and it is questionable to even call this ""memory foam."" I am very upset, and I apparently can't return it."
5,We'll fight our in-laws for it.,"Originally, we got this to put on a 40-year-old mattress in our basement so my in-laws could sleep in better-than-air-mattress comfort and I wouldn't have to give up, you know, access to the master bath. I'm selfish like that. Then, after they left (""Give it a chance,"" said my father-in-law; my mother-in-law just gave me the mystical, ""You didn't have to do that.""), we moved it up to our 10-year-old mattress (with access to master bath). For the first couple of nights, we were uncertain. Now, though, we love it, and the next time my in-laws come to town, I guess it's back to the air mattress for them."
2,Too soft and too much of a chemical smell,"I followed the required 48 hours and then some, to air out this memory foam but unfortunately, the chemical smell would not dissipate enough for me to be able to enjoy this product.In addition, to the smell, this memory foam is VERY soft, with very little density, causing you to sink too much into the foam. As a result, my pillow was too high and my neck was at an odd angle. Perhaps, I need to buy a thinner pillow when using this type of memory foam but I think it's related more to the density factor of this product.Pretty much agree with everyone else here who states, you get what you pay for.I give 1 star for the product and 1 star because they accepted the return without issue."
5,Better Sleep Now!!,"I love this product. I have not been sleeping well on this military issued bed, so I decided to purchase this mattress pad and it has changed my whole sleeping patterns. I now sleep a whole lot better. A minor dislike that I can live with is that it has this weird smell to it. I suggest others to probably let it air out on both sides before actually putting it to use or you'll have that weird mentholly smell for a couple of days in your room. Other than that, I'm satisfied. Thanks"
5,Great for back,"Love this product, it is great for a sore back. Best thing, yes when you open it, it has a smell, however let it air out overnight and it will go away. When you sleep on this it will not make you sweat like other foam products. Well worth the money. I was also packaged very well."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Not as great as I thought it would be. I didn't realize these types of pads are ""hot"" to sleep on, and even though they are venilated, I awake in the night in a sweat in the winter! Another downside was the actual size which was 52 1/4 wide by 70 3/4 long, leaving quite a gap from the actual size of my queen size bed.Something to keep in mind when buying."
5,Somehow relieves pressure on arthritic joints,"Was considering taking the leap, and getting on of those expensive space age foam beds. A friend recommended a space age foam topper for my existing bed, which is not that old. Amazon had a number of options from different manufacturers. I went by the consumer ratings, and picked this one at just under $100. When I lay down on my regular bed, the pressure on my joints shifts, and I become uncomfortable. It is hard to fall asleep when that happens. The pad has helped tremendously. It seems to hug my form, giving the kind of support that makes getting comfortable much easier, therefore falling asleep is much easer. I am very happy with my purchase. It does not do much for my right foot, which is arthritic, because there isn't enough weight to have it sink in there. I think exercise and gentle massage is part of the answer there. Still, I am much more comfortable, and sleep much better."
5,Truly great topper,"If I could give 10 stars I would have done so. This is the third topper I have had for my bed and by far and away the best.It came in a scrunched up ball that opened completely in 4 hours. There was very little smell to it - I had no trouble sleeping on it the first night.It supports your body no matter what position you lie in - you can feel the foam moving when you shift; but, you never sink to the bottom. You are definitely supported.It comes with a longer guarantee than the other toppers, so it will be interesting to see how long it does last before it simply cannot support you any more.If you want to feel like you are 'sleeping on a cloud', this is the item for you."
2,Way too soft,"The title tells it all. It starts to be good if you weigh 250+ pounds. Otherwise you end up sinking in it and having a sore back. Before purchasing this one, consider twice driving to Target, Walmart, or Bed bath and beyond to get one from there, because returning the product via mail is virtually impossible because of the size."
4,Great product!,"Bought for our son in college and he loves it. Says it makes his bed so much more comfortable. We bought him one from Kohls which was a memory foam egg-crate on sale for $40. Totally not worth it! But this Sleep Studio Sleep Joy 3"" was awesome! Not too big to put on your sheets and thick enough to really feel the difference when sleeping."
5,Sleeping better than ever,I am sleeping much sounder since I added this topper to my bed. I fall asleep quickly and stay asleep until morning. It seems to help lessen the morning aches and pains too.
5,Sleep studio 3 inch Visc02,I bought this for my son at college! The dorm mattress is hard as rock with a thick plastic cover. He loves this topper! He tells me every week how great it is! Now he thinks he needs one for his bed at home! I would order a cover for it because everything sticks to it!
5,Memory Foam Pad,The mattress pad is nice and soft. You sort of sink into it but it is much better than just sleeping on the mattresses in the dorm
5,Great for Back Surgery Patients!,"My mom recently had back surgery. She had her back fused and needed to wear a brace to move. the foam topper on her bed was great because after she left the hospital, she needed a comfortable yet supportive surface to sleep in. The foam mattress topper hugged her body as soon as she got into bed and prevented her from moving around too much, allowing her body to heal properly.She loves the topper, I don't think she'll ever sleep in a bed without her memory foam again."
2,Disappointed,"The delivery was really quick and I appreciated that. The smell lasted longer than they made it sound but it did go away.The pad is true to the measurements they gave but they cut them two inches shorter and narrower than the true size of the mattress. They say they do that to ensure it will fit. I bought a full and kind of wish I had gotten a queen and cut down to size.I got it to help make my air mattress better. And it did for the most part. Unfortunately, it seems to attract water. I've had it on my air mattress for a couple months and just today while I was recentering it noticed it was wet underneath. So I took it off and there is mold on it. How am I supposed to clean that?"
5,No more backache.,This mattress topper is great. My husband loves it. He was grumpy every morning from a bad back and now he wakes up still grumpy but his back doesn't hurt any more.
2,It's ok but very expensive for what it is.,this is very hot and expensive foam. I dont really think its worth the money- you could probably find something more affordable and better
2,Never got to use it,I never got to use this item. Opened the box and saw that the mattress pad was tearing before I even unwrapped it and I sent it back. .
3,torn and damaged.,"I purchased this based on the positive reviews. Perhaps I received an inferior product or the manufacturer changed but I am very disappointed. When it arrived, the shipping box was torn and the casing around the topper was torn and damaged."
3,Foam Mattress,"Mattress was for our trailer, which we have not used since mattress came. There were not instruction of any kind and it was rolled up in a tight roll. Had a hard time getting it unrolled. Edge were all rounded and did not know what to do. Sent e-mail to you and got no reply. After a few days it came up and rounded edges came out. Was going to send it back, but due to the holiday rush, we did not. Hope it will give a good night sleep. At the time we recieved it, I was not too happy with your company."
5,best sleep in a while,I have had this for one night and I am very happy with it. I cant afford whole memory foam mattress so this is the next best thing
1,Bad product,"I should have given this product time before reviewing as now I need to edit my 1st review. This product within 3 months of my son using it (he's 29 and 165 lbs.) is now useless. I bought it for my twin guest bed that is extra firm, at first, it was adequate and seemed better than an egg crate. Within 3 months it lost it's cushion in the middle between his chest and butt, and now it's like having nothing on the bed. I paid too much for this to have given out so soon. It's not like he's that big a guy. I thought at first it was better than an egg crate topper but now know better. Starts out with a bang and ends quickly with a thud."
2,Imitation Memory Foam,"This product is ok for the price, but don't be fooled, you aren't getting a great deal on a memory foam topper. This is not real visco-elastic memory foam. If it was, they would be stating the density. It does make a comfy mattress pad though."
5,Done wonders for my sleep!,Purchased this product because the 1inch thick egg crate foam topper I had was getting old. I am so glad I did! Absolute comfort and no smell! I so look forward to going to sleep at night and sleep like a baby! Perfect addition to completing your sleep haven!
1,Wrong item from wrong place,"Not a ventilated pad, was the wrong size (way too wide), came with a note from [...], reciept says it's supposed to be the the item here, but it's obviously not because there is no holes in it. Not going to bother trying to cram this thing back into the box after it expanded all over the place. I'll just trim it to fit and shop locally next time I buy something like this. This is the first big purchase I've made from amazon in a long time. Now I remember why.on a side note, Amazon Prime is worthless if the items you buy are not coming directly from amazon."
3,"Works Great, But Too Soft!","I thought I wanted a very soft bed. In fact, I told my husband that I wanted a bed made of marshmallow. I've always HATED a hard/firm mattress and am very, very picky about needing a pillow-top. Stupidly, I bought a pillow-top mattress from Ikea and have regretted it ever since. It's terribly firm. I ordered this, thinking that it would provide me with a super soft bed, and boy, did it ever. Much to my own surprise, this was so soft that I couldn't roll over. It's too soft. Also, this pad isn't sized properly. It was a good 3 to 4 inches smaller than my king mattress. Last, the peppermint stench of this pad isn't nice."
2,Not Happy,"Well, I bought this topper thinking that the thickness would make a difference in the comfort level. Wrong. Its too soft. My hips and abdomen sink in so far that my ankles and feet as well as my forearms and hands don't rest flat on the bed, putting excessive angle at the shoulders and hip joint...I guess this is one one those cases where it may have been better to go with a thinner topper, maybe only one inch. I guess I'll have to take the costly trial and error route to discover what is best. I did receive it promptly so no fault to Amazon."
2,Just Foam,"I agree with the other post, you get what you pay for. Just 3 inch3es of foam nothing more. Nothing close to Tempur Pedic. Sank all the way down to the bed no support at all. Suppose to be 3-4 lb of support., I dont think so. Cheaper to just buy a thick foam pad. Also when you get the cover its full of some type of oil and took a while to disapate. Hands were full of oil and oil on my sheets."
4,Review of Visc02 memory foam mattress.,"The mattress is very comfortable and serves well even just on a box spring, however I ordered a 3 inch mattress and recieved a 2 inch mattress. the overall length is about 2-3 inches too short to cover the box spring but over all works well."
3,Mattress topper too soft,"This is a very nice mattress topper and appears to be good quality. However, it is very soft. Probably OK for kids but too soft for adults. It doesn't do much for the ROCK we put it on. (The ROCK is a super firm rock-hard mattress.)"
2,"waaay too soft, and undersized!","This mattress topper is simply way too soft. I've read the reviews, and it seems there was a better version when it first came out. this one must be made of 2lb density (or.. less??)It is also cut short! the normal size for California king is 72x84, and this topper is only about 70x80!! why?!?!!I bought it in hopes to make my mattress firmer, but its even softer than the mattress I had. you can easily compress the whole thing with ONE FINGER. if that doesnt say something about the softness, nothing willthe only good thing about it is its cooler. it has 1000s of holes in it (supposed to be that way). if your mattress is already firm enough this will help cool it down. thats the only good thing I can see about itI went with a 4"" 5LB density topper ($350) instead, its much betterso if your looking for something with any firmness at all, stay away from this! if your just looking for something to cool your memory foam mattress down, this will help"
5,Great!,"Great comfort. I would highly recommend! A+++. Soft and comfortable, deffinetly conforms to your body and then returns to normal state. A small negative was that the twin pad was smaller than my twin bed, but I think that is done on purpose, so that it fits the bed. Great price also!"
2,Not happy with purchase,"Sleep Studio 3 inch ViscO2 Ventilated Memory Foam Mattress Topper is not that comfortable, it does not feel like memory foam at all. It does not contour to your body like real memory foam does. Still woke up with back and shoulders hurting. Looked else where and found a much better memory foam topper that actually works and feels comfortable."
3,"Decent topper, comfortable but....","Mattress topper was comfortable. The only issue we had was that the topper had a strpong peppermint odor that takes a while to dissapate. I would suggest airing this out for several days before attempting to sleep on it, unless you like sleeping on peppermint"
3,not what I expected,"Mine has a strong smell of peppermint. Also, I was disappointed. I have been having pains in my legs and arms after or during sleep. My sister suggested a foam pad. She has one and loves it. And I saw many strongly favorable reviews here at Amazon. But I find that I don't like the feeling of sinking into the pad. I am 5'3"" and 130 lbs. I find my hips sink too low compared to the rest of my body for my comfort."
5,Very Comfortable and Highly Recommend!!,"This mattress topper is wonderful...very comfortable. But I will tell you that I have a full size bed and according to the other reviews, I ordered a queen size because people said the full size wasn't big enough. Well needless to say, I had to cut 3 inches off the length and 6 off the width. So I hope knowing this will help someone in the future who is leary of what size to order. This pad is so much better than the ones in the store that were twice as much money. I would highly recommend it. My husband and I both suffer from bad backs and we haven't been as stiff in the morning after sleeping on this."
1,dont buy if you like to sleep in colder temps,"We were very excited for our mattres topper to come, as the reviews were extremely helpful. Unfortunately, it didn't work out for us as we like to sleep in a cold room...60 degrees. When the room is this cold, the mattress turns to rock until it has time to warm up from your body heat. And it softens only in the places where you are laying, so don't change positions! Think about this before you purchase. Ours is on its way back to Amazon!"
3,Sleep Studio ViscO2 Ventilated 3 Inch Memory Foam,"I assumed that the ventilation holes would make this foam a bit softer than the Serta I previously purchased, and I was wrong. This very firm....too firm for the kids' beds, so we use it for kids staying overnight on the floor.Fair price, good product, just a bit too firm for us."
5,Perfect Solution,I purchased this mattress topper for my mother in law because she was complaining about back pain. She says she doesn't want to get out of bed in the morning she is now sleeping so comfortably. I would purchase again.
2,Mattress was damaged,My first mattress topper came with a large tear in it. I returned it and reordered another one. The next one came with two tears in it. So I ended up having to return both. It was very difficult to return the mattress back into the box!
3,Good Value,Pros:Good ValueComfortableCome in small packageCons:You sink in far too deepConclusions:Good product but it does seem to make you sink in far too deep. Some customers spoke of it smelling but after taking it out of the box for a whole day the smell dissipated and it was fine to use. (It does advise you to in the box)
3,no memory foam,This is a pure foam topper. It may be fine for light weight children but not for adults. It compresses to nothing once an adult lays on it. I bought this for my college bound son but ended up giving it to our 12 year old. Cost of returnning shipping did not seem justified. In hindsight I should have returned it but too late now.
5,No new bed ...,"just a new mattress topper. Before you buy an expensive mattress, give this product a try. Popped open quickly and haveslept better ever since I put it on my mattress. Lives up to product description. Comfortable, cool, and what a deal!"
4,Extend mattress life,"My mattress is 14 years old. It had become so uncomfortable I was sleeping on the couch at times. Just couldn't afford to buy a new one right now. I purchased this mattress topper, and I've been sleeping on it for a few months. I highly recommend it, because it has allowed me to continue using a too-firm, worn out mattress. I don't think a thinner mattress pad would offer enough cushion/support, and the thicker ones are too expensive. I find this one to be just right!"
5,zzzzzzz,Yep.This is certainly the cure for insomnia.If anything - this is actually too confortable.I got one for myself and then my parents .. I really don't know what I would do without it.
3,not as firm as it describe and it smells,"it is still soft, not as firm as I thought. it smells , I let it sit there for 3 days and it still smells. The smell goes away each day little bit"
2,Less than expected,I was so excited to try this product after sleeping on memory foam at a vacation rental this summer. This is a huge disappointment. Neither my husband or I have slept well since purchasing this product. I would send it back if I could. No blissful sleep here...:(
5,you think you've been sleeping? think again!,"this mattress pad is great. perfectly fits my generic college dorm mattress, and i feel like i'm sleeping on my soft mattress that i use at home. at first i thought it was too soft, but you get used to it fairly quickly. now it feels just right. it really does take off some of those pressure points. i hardly have to move around at all. i just like down and, well, heaven. the mattress rebounds to original shape very quickly as well. i can totally recommend this product! p.s.: i was going to buy the 2inch pad, but it was out of stock. this one definitely gets the job done, i can't speak for or against the other."
5,I sleep like a baby,"I was very surprise how comfortable a 3 inch mattress feel. I sleep on my side so, its very comfortable for me. It's been two months and I Highly recommend."
2,No Relief,"Have been sleeping on this for almost 3 mths now. My husband and I have lower back problems( we are not large people). Thought maybe this would help. After airing out its horrible smell for a day as suggested on here it took about 2 weeks for the smell to disapate on the actual bed. Neither one of us have felt ANY relief in this time frame. It is just an added mattress to an already 3yr old mattress since there is no where to store it or throw it out. It is extremely warm to sleep on as well. That would be the only plus to anyone in a cold area, it holds in the heat."
4,love it,"It's not one of those mattress toppers that you just sink in, but it forms around the body very well and provides great support. Haven't had back pain ever since i got this!"
1,Not Same As Last Time.....,"Disappointed. I ordered this topper back in fall and it was very very good. I have been moving around Afghanistan a good bit and not able to hold on to the original so I ordered a second spurred by the reduced price and previous experience. The second is no good. I could tell when I picked up the box first time we had a dude, the weight gave it away. The topper seems to be normal weight foam I could have gotten at PX here in Afghanistan for $24. I now understand the reduced cost on Amazon....."
3,"Ok, not great","Bought a new mattress and discovered it was too firm. Couldn't return the mattress so bought this topper. The size is exactly the same as the king mattress, didn't notice much of a chemical smell. Let it air out and expand to size for about 12 hours then slept on it that night. It does make the mattress tolerable to sleep on but does not conform to the contours of my body as much as I thought it would for a side sleeper. My husband sleeps mostly on his back and he has no complaints. I was hoping that because of the ventilation it would not be hot. Unfortunately it seems to absorb your body heat and about half way through the night you start to toast. So if you want some cushioning but not the softness of a pillow top and are not warm natured this is the topper for you. As usual, Amazon got this item to us amazingly fast and the shipping was free."
3,Not all I had expected,This topper is nice but it's firmness is just above average (maybe a 6 or so on a scale of 10). I have lower back pain and bought this topper to see if it would help alleviate the stress on the back. It has to a small degree but it is not the silver bullet I was hoping for. The upside is that it is comfortable and well made with air holes throughout. It simply is not as firm as I would expect most people looking at this for back pain would be hoping for or expect.
4,not so bad for the $,"very comfy and I sleep through the night very soundly and I like that/need that rest.i did not noticed any smell/stink like other had noted.other reviews are correct, it is warm and will make you sweat on hot/warm nights. this is the only negative. i dont know why and how to resolve this. maybe sleep with less clothes on during the summer."
3,We sent it back,"We sent it back as my wife and I couldn't make peace with the odor (green tea, or Junior Mints). it certainly was comfortable to lie on, physically. Getting it back into the box was impossible of course; had to go buy a huge box from U-Haul."
5,3in Visco2 Mattress Enhancer,I was waking up sore and stiff before I purchased this mattress topper. What a difference it has made! I truly love it!
2,much too soft,"If you like soft, this is the topper for you! For me, it was entirely too soft. So soft that you sunk into it so far that simply rolling over during the night is difficult. I was expecting a memory foam that had more of a density to it, that was not the case here. It was very hot to sleep on and more like sleeping on plain old foam rubber than a memory foam."
2,Disappointing,"Our previous memory foam topper served us well for more than five years, but was finally giving up the ghost. After some research, I thought this would be a good replacement. Not so! Although it is three inches thick, it lacks resilience and was far less comfortable than the old one we are replacing. I should have returned it after the first week, but made the mistake of thinking we would get used to it. So, the 30-day return window slipped by. IF YOU BUY THIS, be sure you are satisfied with it before the return window closes. Don't think you'll get used to it, because there is a vast array of better toppers out there."
5,Dream Foam,"This mattress topper was just what I needed. My mattress was just too firm. Initially, I was planning to buy a new mattress and then I read about this topper. I am so glad I got it. I sleep much better now. You do have to let it air out for a couple of days though."
4,pretty good sleep,"this was a good product. It doesn't have a bad smell and came on time. I think it's a little bit too soft for a memory foam, but all and all, not too bad."
4,What Great Matress Topper,I chose it because when my sister & I stayed at the Hampton Inn I slept on a mattress topper and it was the best sleep I had ever got . I loved it slept great.
5,Mattress Topper,This mattress topper is well worth the investment. I have back and sciatic problems that made sleeping on my left side difficult. This topper has solved the problem. I have been getting great night's sleep since I installed it . It does make the bed a little higher which gave my husband problems at first but he has gotten use to it and now finds it great as well. Would order another one in a heartbeat.
2,lost the shape,after a year.. it lost the shape.. not giving the same support that at the beginning.. very disappointed of this product
2,Not As Expected,"I have purchased memory foam toppers before, with great experience. I needed new one and thought this product would be just as good, if not better, based on the stellar reviews. Wrong.It doesn't feel like memory foam, provides very little support, and feels uncomfortably warm. The ventilation hole design is such a gimmick.Do yourself a favor and get a quality topper with higher density instead."
5,Like sleeping on a Cloud...,"I have a firm orthopedic mattress that i bought since i dont really like fluffy mattresses... after a few nights i decided that it was a bit too firm so i started looking at what i could add to it so it could be a little more cushy. I dont like feather beds because i just dont like waking up to a cloud of feathers flying around me, and fiber beds just stop working after a while (I used to own one). So i started looking at foam toppers. For the money, i thought this would be pretty decent.What a surprise!!! I never thought it would feel so good. i just woke up from one of my most relaxing nights ever... and i didnt even have to drink tea or wine to sleep that well. I have fallen in LOVE!.. I can't recommend this item enough... I'd give it 10 stars if i could. Very happy customer here.. and of course with amazon prime, i didnt even have to pay for shipping, I got it the day after i bought it. I am very satisfied. Thanks Amazon.com!"
5,good night at the in-laws.,"We bought this pad to use at my in-laws. Since we only visit, we get to spend the night on a very old and hard double bed. Our backs couldn't take it anymore so we took matters into our own hands. I haven't tried it but my husband has and he said there wasn't any comparison in quality. He could finally get a good night's sleep and get out of bed without the morning backache.Yes, the other reviewers were correct when they said that the mattress pad needs time to open up to full size and does smell. I let it do it's thing with the bedroom windows open and the door closed. It's not an issue any more."
3,good for price; but little too soft,"pros: no chemical type smell, made a firm older bed feel better to sleep on. However, we also bought a different brand 2.5 gel memory foam topper for other bed. Laid both on floor -- gel one was much more dense and comfortable, could barely feel floor, great memory, cool. Visc02 3"" felt way softer/thinner (even tho it is thicker) & not as dense as expected... immediately sank and could surely feel hard floor. but for the price, not bad buy."
5,Extremely comfy on top of a futon mattress,"I have been using this for about a month and love it. I put it on top of an Ikea futon bed mattress and it works like a charm. One major advantage is that this doesn't transfer motion from one side of the bed to the other. The smell was completely gone in about a week or so. As someone body else as written, make sure you measure your bed before ordering. I had to order one size up to make sure it will fit my bed."
5,Help is on the way...,I was having a lot of trouble with my hips - could not seem to find a comfortable position and was waking up to turn every which way. Although this is not going to solve the problem - only medical treatment down the road will do that - this has helped tremendously. I am much more comfortable and sleeping much better. I can even lie on my side for extended periods of time. I am so glad I took a chance.
5,Excellent Mattress Topper,"Had the best night sleep in a very long time. Used this the first weekend camping in my new trailer and slept great! Liked it so well, I bought a new one for our king bed at home. Can't wait for it to arrive!"
2,Literally stinks,"I just returned this item. Item had a very noticeable plastic smell to it. The instructions say it should fade in about 24 hours but after a week it was still very strong. The bedroom was saturated with the smell. Even though I let it air out for about 12 hours before putting it on the bed. And we put a fan blowing across it for three days in a row during the day with the window open.My wife is Asthmatic and after five days it started triggering asthma attacks. We had no choice but to pack it up and get it out of the house. I don't have asthma and I felt some mild irritation from it.Probably ok for those who don't have a breathing problem, but if you have Asthma stay away from this thing.Other than the strong odor, works as advertised, really helped to sleep better. But with the odor that's beside the point, if your wife is choking all night. I buy a lot from Amazon and this is probably only the second item I've ever returned, if not the first."
1,very disappointed. will return,"I am very disappointed in this product, so much so that I am going to return it.I have had two other memory foam toppers in the past, so I am familiar with this type of product. I purchased this one based on the reviews. This one is made of very flimsy foam, in my opinion. When I lay on it, the foam collapses completely so that there is maybe 1/4"" of foam underneath most of my body. Also, there are holes poked through the foam, perhaps to circulate air, but I believe this will lead to this foam breaking down much faster than a similar mattress topper without holes punched through it."
3,disappointed,"I had purchased this item in 2inch for a king bed and it was fabulous. When I went to order one for a queen bed, the 3"" was cheaper so I went with it but it is too deep. I should have spent the extra money and gotten the 2"" mattress."
2,not good topper,"i bought this product thinking that it will solve the softiness of my mattress. I was wrong, this mattress is very comfy, but not very good as a topper. If you ave an old mattress like i do.... do not buy this one."
4,This was a gift.,"We purchased this as a gift to a family member with an older mattress. We thought the price was a good value.The gift receiver said that it made a big difference in the way the bed feels and they are getting a better night's sleep, now.They have had it for 3 months and are still happy with it."
1,Smelled like mold for 3 months!,This topper smelled like mold for 3 months and it did not significantly lessen the uncomfortableness of my mattress (firm). I have to buy a new mattress after dealing with this moldy smell....
3,No instructions!,I just received my Sleep Studion Visc02 Memory Foam Mattress Topper and there is no instructions to tell me which side goes up! One side has small holes and the other has large holes. Can anyone tell me which way is up (LOL)?
3,Wrong Size,"I ordered this for a California King size bed. It's supposed to be 70 by 82. It's not. It's 70 x 80 and is way too short on both sides. Rather than try to stuff it back in the box for a refund, I hope Amazon reads this and gives me a partial refund (if they do I'll come back and edit this). Haven't slept on it yet....so no comment on that. I'm just really disappointed in the size they sent. Obviously, no one is checking the quality control."
1,"2"" version is toxic","The 2"" version of this topper feels good, but it gives off toxic gas.A perfumy scent that the manufacturer has presumably applied and possibly other gasses are being released from the foam. This may be the cause of an unusual fuzzy feeling in my head and respiratory inflammation from sleeping only one night on this topper. I am not generally sensitive to chemicals. I have uncovered the foam and opened the windows to give it a good chance to air-out. I patted the foam firmly all over, flipping it periodically through the day to encourage the release of trapped gas.I have given this product a rating of one star because it is not usable due to toxic off-gassing. I am returning this product."
1,outrageous price,this item almost doubled in price in a couple of weeks. Are they nuts! They can keep it
2,On the Road with Wellington,"If you plan to tour the Napoleonic battlefields of Spain, or if you collect ALL volumes on the Peninsular War, buy this book. Military historians visintg Espana will find Robertson's notes and maps invaluable. He also presents a fairly comprehenisve bibliography of what to read next.If this isn't you, skip it. There are better overviews and surveys available. As a travel guide though, it's awfully good. Bon voyage!"
1,Beware of poor packaging!,"What appears to be a nice, handmade product is packaged in a careless way. Sled arrived in a thin crushed cardboard box without cushioning, and wooden frame was broken. Now it is my responsibility to deal with repacking and returning. Really disappointing. A better packing job would have prevented such waste."
4,Beautiful sled - needs beefing up for use with dogs,"This is really a beautiful sled, just wonderful to look at. It really works well as a dogsled except that it is a bit fragile. First trip out I barely caught the front metal tube on a small tree and ripped it out of the wood frame. A few trips later the handle broke. Not really the fault of the sled but you just need to realize dog sledding is going to put a lot of stress on this sled. Some suggestions: Add a brush bow in front to protect the frame, reinforce the seat frame at both ends near the connections and replace the handle - I knew that one wasn't going to last as soon as I looked at it.Otherwise, this sled is perfect for the person with one or two dogs (and whose wife won't let them get anymore!). Living in Alaska where we still have snow is helpful too :-)"
1,Item ships in TWO boxes. Amazon doesn't know this.,"This kicksled ships in two boxes. Apparently, there is no record of this in the Amazon system. I received only one box - a chair, but no runners. Customer service is not at all interested in even checking to see if the other box is in the warehouse - returning it is the only option. So much for the Christmas present... It might be a better bet to buy this from someone small."
5,Bought 2 -- happy with them,"Amazon solved an initial shipping problem (shipped half the sled) quickly.I am very pleased with the two sleds I bought. They are flexible, so they work well on uneven ground as well as smooth."
5,Superb interpretation of Adam Smith,"Resolves the contradiction between Adam Smith's support of the ""free market"" and his repeated condemnations of monopoly and market abuse as ""inevitable."" Argues that Smith saw the ""optimal form"" of capitalism as being one in which responsible government under the tutelage of enlightened gentlement aristocrat/capitalist farmers could successfully keep in check negative tendencies of capitalism."
1,Good but....,"Well, it could be a good film if there were no another one which is the best. If you have friends in Russia ask them for 1982 TV movie with the same title and compare."
1,Falling Up Should Fall out,"Falling Up's debut album Crashings is nothing more then a really bad rip off of Linkin Park. The music is exactly like Linkin Park and the vocals are like listening to Hanson. This is 2004 rock for sure. Here in 2004 and gone by 2005. I would suggest buying the new Demon Hunter or VAST record, before buying this trash."
3,"5 for the cd, 0 for the band",The sad fact is that this album is good only due to very impressive studio work. I saw this band in concert not too long ago and simply put they were terrible. While I did end up buying the cd because the cd is very enjoyable. It has a good spread of semi-heavy rock tunes that you can rock out too. Unfortunately its the same old poor christian music that kutless and 12 stones (two of the worst bands in the world) give you.
5,I love it!,These guys are truely awesome! I love their sound because they don't sound like any other band. They are uniquely their own and have strong Christian based lyrics!
3,Not sure on this one...,"Perhaps it's just my picky nature, but I really didn't care for this CD. Don't get me wrong, I love track 1 and 3! But the rest just doesn't fit my appeal... Lyrics are okay, but I can't stand their sound: it's like Metallica meets boy band. Not exactly a pleasent sound =)"
2,Great live show,"Frankly, I don't care for Falling Up's music that much. But when I saw them on the Sea of Faces tour, they blew me away with an incredible performance. All six of them have amazing, relentless stage presence that rivets you. Their guitarist Joe has all the thrashing moves of a hardcore guitarist. What's more, they're really cool people to talk to and joke around with. So while I can't recommend the album, I wholeheartedly advise you to see them in concert. It's worth it."
3,Not Bad But I LIke Their Later Efforts Better,"This is an ""okay"" rock album. I like Falling Up but mainly for their later work. I felt like many of the earlier songs sounded alike and didn't offer much of a distinct sound. Many of the songs seemed to have this layer of noise to them that distracted from any kind of structure. The band changed a lot over the years and albums like 'Capitva' start showing their maturity. This is still a good album (especially if you are trying to expand your Falling Up collection), but I wouldn't say it is their best."
5,Music is great company,I love the DVD; the next best thing to being there live; The CD was great; the DVD is better.
2,Booorrring!!!,"I found this book quite boring and it took me a couple of months to finish it, because I didn't find it compelling enough to pick up consistently.It seemed to rush through much of the story and the characters weren't developed as much as they could have been. I don't recommend this book. I found Red Water by Judith Freeman to be a much better read, with more fully developed characters."
4,Granddaughter of John D. Lee,"John D. Lee is my Great-great-great Grandfather. I have read just about every piece of fiction and non-fiction on him and on the subject of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. I would have to say this is one of the few that makes any attempt to explain just what it was that made the Mormons attack that day. While it was surely a horrible tragedy, it was not simply a random act of violence. We must always keep in mind what a different place the US was then, violent and cruel and even good men did terrible things. My Grandfather was a good man and he was part of a terrible thing. This book goes a little way to explaining how and why and how he was also ultimately a victim of the Meadows himself."
3,Ok,"Couldn't find one anywhere and finally came across this. Had to tape the plastic holder around the bristles as it had a tendency to crack. Still using it, though."
5,Great Cooker,"It was just the size we wanted and also the price was very good. Itwas stainless steel not aluminum that was our choice,also. It performsvery nicely and it was shipped very promptly after I ordered it. Theproduct Presto is very good and I would suggest anyone who wants apressure cooker get a Presto."
5,"Great product, great price","I really like that this is made from stainless steel. Nice tight seal, and very obvious button to show when it is safe to open. I'm very happy with my purchase."
2,not the Presto I knew before,"I have the Presto 6-Quart and it is well built. This 4-Quart is a junk. The wall is thinner than the 6-Quart and the seal leaks. If you bought the 4-Quart one, watch for the cooking time. Because of the seal leak, the food may be burnt pretty quickly. That's what happened to once. It never happened to the 6-Quart one. Interestingly, the logo on the 4-Quart one is completely different from the one on the 6-Quart one."
4,Awesome,"I really liked it, except that it has no whistles like Indian pressure cookers. Nonetheless, I would def recommend it."
5,Perfect Pressure Cooker.,"I love this pressure cooker. The size is great for a small meal, but not too small to be functional. The quality is wonderful and I look forward to many more years of quick, easy meals. Definately worth the price for stainless steel vs aluminum. I got rid of my aluminum cookers and love this one so much more. No regrets!"
4,Well made product.,"We haven't had to use this product yet but its definitely well made, heavy construction with built in safety features. Everything you need for small batch canning, cooking or to sterilize is included minus the items you would expect to supply. Item arrived quickly. I don't believe the price can be beat on a pressure cooker of this size and quality."
4,Pressure cooker,"For the money, this cooker was an excellent choice. It sealed quickly and was relatively quiet. The meat I cooked was tender and moist."
5,why didn't I get this before?,"Best value in the kitchen.The ease of use and the fast and fantastic results are amazingAlso get Pressure Perfect by Lorna Sass.It gives some really important tips and informationfor those of you, like me, who had never pressure cooked before.The 6-Quart is perfect for 2 to 3 people."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!!!,"Awesome crock pot--my first one was an electric one, with the timer, and the slow cooker and the steamer--all the bells and whistles. The first time I used it , it worked great, then that was it. It had a plastic gasket instead of rubber, and it only took one time to ruin it. I love my Presto (rec: stainless)-I use it all most every day, since I home cook for my dogs."
4,I like it!,"I made beef soup after I get the pressure cooker, it is really delicious and it only spent 20 minutes to cook. It is really save time.The pressure cooker size is perfect for a family. It is easy to use and saft. I enjoy to use this pressure cooker to cook."
4,excellent bargain,"Before purchasing this pressure cooker, I went to Macy's and bought an aluminum pressure cooker because it was on sale. Got it home and tried it out. After cooking my meal, I noticed the inside of the pressure cooker had become terribly discolored. I did not want my family eating out of that pressure cooker. So I immediately took it back. I purchased the Presto 6-qt. pressure cooker and I do love it. It is stainless steel, easy clean-up and no discoloration. I should have known better because I had a Presto for over 25 years. The rocker on my old one wore out and I knew it was time to get another. If you're looking to replace an older model or just plain looking for a new pressure cooker, you won't be disappointed with this one."
5,Very good product,"Stainless Steelworks very good.have had it for few weeks now , so far no problem.is easy to clean."
1,"Warning, pot melts under heat!!","I have two old Presto pressure cookers that I have used for years, but they needed new parts and I took the opportunity to buy a new pressure cooker. No where in the details on Amazon did I see the warning that the pot melts!! Buried in the middle of the book is the warning that if you let the pot get too hot the aluminum core will separate and melt.Under normal cooking, not a problem. But if something sudden happens, for example, a child gets hurt and you run to help and forget to turn the pot off, you do not have a burned on mess, you have a melted pot. Who wants that?I cannot believe that they sell a pot that they know will melt if you accidentally leave it on too long."
4,Pressure cooker,"My husband finally convinced me to throw out my mother's old pressure cooker, which I've been using for 30 years now, because it was probably slowly poisoning us whenever I used it. I bought a Presto 6-qt stainless steel one at a ridiculously low price and it works great! The handles will need tightening eventually (the old one I got rid of had handles that were part of the structure) but as far as cooking with it, couldn't do better."
5,Presto 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker,This product is great_my family has had this product brand in the family for many years and for top quality meals this can't be beat_I would recommend the Presto Pressure Cooker of any size to everyone_
4,A 5* FOR THE PRICE,Can't beat the price for a Chinese stainless steel product; so much better then the old aluminium for cooking and cleaning.
1,Cheap quality,Cheap quality. Screws got rusty after the first wash! I wouldn't trust a pressure cooker that doesn't meet such basic standard!I returned it.
1,"Clean look, but rusty inside -- Not 100% stainless (Fasteners are steel - will rust)","it is stainless, but needs you to wash/dry and maintain waterfree. Otherwise, spots, light rust appears. May not be 18/10 as it should have been - manufacturer take note, improve quality."
4,Comes without steaming basket!,"This cooker comes with a canning rack that stands 3/8"" from the bottom of the pot. The stainless steamer baskets have to be ordered separately from Presto (for a fair price) though its an inconvience if you had planned to steam food; you could ""part boil"" it for now. You can also order from the accessory list that comes with it; a video, cookbbook, additional steamer baskets for multiple meal cooking, glass lid to use it as a pot, and a couple of other items. I purchased this cooker because it is made of stainless to avoid food contamination from aluminum, but the bottom of the pot (outside, underneatth)is aluminum clad and its exposed. I gave it four stars because it does not come with a steamer basket and the exposed aluminum on the underside; which doesn't present a problem if you don't scrub it and contaminate your dish rag and dish water."
5,Excellent,We have used this for about 2 months and are perfectly satisfied with this pressure cooker. It is an ideal accessory in any home. It is big enough to cook meals for upto 6 people.
2,Reconsider...,"After minimal usage may experience the handle becoming loose, as I did. Somewhat annoying to have to tighten the handle's screw after each use. Called the manufacturer about this issue and found them to be unresponsive. I remain a big fan of pressure cookers however am disappointed with this design flaw."
5,Second one,Mother in Law liked ours so much......SHE TOOK IT for herself!...aaarrgghh!We liked it so much WE BOUGHT A SECOND ONE for ourselves! HANDS OFF MOM!Go to the Presto website and order the drop-in basket; it helps keep the veggies in one place and makes them easy to get out of the cooker.
4,Presto 6 qt,"I had a Presto pressure cooker for many, many years and I thought it was a great pot. When I needed to replace it, I looked at a lot of cookers, all makes and prices. This Presto cooker is made well and priced right and you don't have to read a book on how and how not to use it."
4,Cooking made easier,"I bought the Presto 6-quart stainless steel pressure cooker because my mother had one years ago and it worked well. I am pleased that the high standard has been maintained. I like to prepare split peas soup. Before I had the pressure cooker my split peas cooked for about forty five minutes to one hour. With the use of the pressure cooker the time has been reduced to fifteen minutes. In addition, the pressure cooker is user friendly."
5,Great Pressure Cooker,"This Presto Pressure Cooker is all it's cracked up to be. It is very important that the user reads the instruction booklet, completely.The ability to create soups and stews in a short period of time and at the same time, this method of cooking keeps the nutrients from depleting.Cooking the veggies, such as beets and other root veggies, the cooking time is diminished considerablyin the cooker."
5,Good quality and right size,I got this product as a Christmas gift (from my wish list). It's the right size and it's really a good quality! I highly recommend this to everybody!
1,wow it only holds 4 qrts,I bought the 4qrt and a 6qrt model both stainless and when I opened them and sat them side by side..they were both only 4qrts.. wow. talk about false advertisement.I filled both with 4qrts of water just to be sure.. and they were both full to the brim..so I Shipped the one that came in the 6qrt box back for a refund..which was easy as pie Ty amazon.now I'm getting an 8qrt one.so fill up your cookers with water makes sure you got what you paid for.a 4qrt should hold 4qrtsa 6qrt should hold 6Qrtsect ect..
2,Not as nice as the eight quart cooker by Presto,"I will admit that my negative experience with this pressure cooker is partially my fault. I didn't realize that this model did not have a quick release. I should have noticed this from the photo so it is really my fault. I thought all modern day pressure cookers had quick release valves. I have an eight quart pressure cooker by Presto and I am in love with it. That is why I stuck with the same brand. I wanted to get something smaller to cook smaller portions of food.I also didn't like how I had to screw the handles into place. I want something that has permanently attached handles. I'm going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by Presto. I can't seem to find any smaller sized pressure cookers that have a quick release option. If anyone does, please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me."
1,"Wobbly handle, dangerous defect.","Go buy yours in person, this is a risk I took for fifty+ dollars that I've regretted ever since. The handle is wobbly, so it's not safe to lift.Couldn't find a customer service number anywhere on this purchase, not liking this transaction. A number of people tried to figure out a way to fix the handle, so we didn't return it. This is one item best checked before purchase."
5,THAK YOU VERY MUCH!. I LOVE IT!.,"HI HOW ARE YOU. I'M SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED WITH MY PRESSURE COOKER. I REALLY HAVE TO CONGRATS TO YOU FOR THE GOOD SERVICE, PRICE AND THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT.BEST REGARDS."
5,Satisfied customer,"I did quite a bit of research online before purchasing this pressure cooker. It's definitely not top of the line but it absolutely does the job at a economical price. This is my first pressure cooker so I wasn't even sure if I would use it often, but the Presto has won me over. I use it multiple times each week - it's a fantastic convenience. Note that there is some minor assembly required."
1,Caveat emptor,"I bought this based on the high amount of positive reviews. To be fair I have not used it yet (I gave it 1 star due to the following), but anyone who follows the same methods as me when buying things on amazon should look into who is posting reviews. Many posters have only reviewed this product, seems a little shady. The review system is a powerful tool on amazon and this certainly isn't the first company to try and abuse it. Please look to the comments of my review if you don't believe me."
4,Presto 6 Qt SS Pressure cooker is great,"Great time saver on delicious meals. Flavors cook in, rather than boiling out on the cooktop. The only thing that is a little mis-leading is that the cook time starts after the top starts rocking. Even turning the burner on high might take 5-10 minutes to get it rocking, before you can turn it down to medium and start the clock. But, even adding that on is still less than conventional. 6 Qt is right size for any meal for my wife and I make, always leaving plenty of left-overs...dee-lish."
4,Pressure Cooker,I am very pleased. I have no previous experience with pressure cookers however this one does the job very well.
4,Excellent cooker for the price,"As has been said, cut down boiling time down to 1/5th or 1/6th. Boiled pork neck bones for an hour, they broke down in pieces leaving a delicious broth. Also great for making curry."
5,Presto 4 quart Pressure Cooker,"I love this brand of pressure cooker. I own 4 presto pressure cooker. Its sturdy, easy to handle and safe. Cooks food wonderfully. It is the best thus far."
5,use all the time,I use this all the time I wouldn't want to be without it.Cooks fast & would buy again
5,great product,"cheap and as good as the most expensive models.why pay more.its easy to clean ,sturdy ,the only thing its handle screws tend to loosen after repeated handeling"
3,Average Product,I bought this one and assembled on my own but the handle is never tightened despite of multiple timeoverall OK product for price
5,Excellent Cooker,I Love using this cooker. Beans are done super fast. Its easy to wash too and it looks very pretty. I highly recommend it.
4,Lightweight,"This pressure cooker is much, much lighter in weight than the old Presto 6 qt. stainless steel pressure cooker I've used for over 20 years. So far, it seems to be OK, but it does take longer, too, for the steam to let off. On the plus side, it seems to cook food a little faster."
1,Wanted to like it...,"Sadly returning this. The handles won't stay tight and the screws that hold them are already rusting. Plus hard to get it up to pressure - too much sputtering around the handle for a long time! I remember my Mother cooking delicious tender meats in her pressure cooker years ago. But I did not have good results with this one. Followed directions and chicken came out tough. And - a magnet won't stick to the interior (only the exterior)...so maybe the interior is not stainless steel, but aluminum..which is not what I want to cook my food in. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy."
5,Back to healthy cooking and fast!,"I just bought the stainless steel pressure cooker because I heard that cooking with aluminum is not healthy. I also read that slow cookers have a coating on the dish that contains lead (under the government standards for safety). I cook game meats and find them a little tough and take a lot of electricity to get them tender. With the stainless steel pressure cooker, those entire problems are solved. Yesterday I put two pounds of frozen chicken into water and cooked it for less than a half hour. Then took out the chicken, added all the veggies and potatoes to the stock and cooked them for three minutes. Wow, what a great stew. They say almost all the nutrients remain in the foods. That's my favorite item from now on. My mom also used the pressure cooker when I was a child. Its about time I did too. Very happy with my purchase."
5,Great Pressure Cooker,"It's been several months since I've purchased the Presto 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker, and I have to admit that this cooker packs some seriously power! Having a pressure cooker speeds up cooking so much - I've been able to make a lot of Chinese Soups in a fraction of the time it takes to make normally! This pot is especially good when cooking soups with proteins, particularly beans and meat. Because it cooks so quickly, we're not only enjoying dinner faster, but saving a lot of energy to boot! Highly recommended!"
2,It surprised me with the rusty screws on the handle,It surprised me with the rusty screws on the handle! I used only one time with non-salt food and soon I found the screws are rusty! I bought one two years ago and that one just did great even now. But this new one is not.The manufacturer needs really pay attention to the details of their parts qualifacation. Function is good but the screws breached the overall. I like the function but sorry I can not give a high rate because of the rust.
5,Impressive!,"Good size for 2 people. i also purchased the glass cover and the steamer basket. I can cook an entire meal at one time with a little planning. there are hundreds of recipes and techniques online, so i am still learning as i go. This cooker should last a lifetime with proper care and will see a lot of use. Highly recommended!"
5,Best Cooker,"Best product,PRESTO Cooker make my wife happy, I will refer to my friends,It cooks healthy food, easy to use, easy to clean"
5,My Presto pressure cooker.,This is the perfect size for my family ! A big plus is it's stainless steel and can be put the dishwasher !I wouldn't be with out it !
5,Instructions could be better.....,"This is a great product. I replaced a 4 qt. aluminum that needed $30.00 worth of parts. Stainless steel construction is great. Five star rating.Just one problem....lid would not go on because of the new gasket. I finally discovered I needed to push down slightly on the middle of the lid to align the lugs. After that, it was easy to install the lid. Instructions made no mention of this small problem.Buy one, you will love it."
4,LIke it,I have always enjoyed using a pressure cooker when raising my 6 children. This cooker is made well and so far I have had no problem with it. It is solid and does the job.
4,It's a saucepan!,"Only a saucepan, but the last one lasted thirty yrs, so I'm hopeful for it too.So far, so good."
3,Difficult to lock top in place,"New to pressure cooking... BUT. The top needs to be giggled about to have it lock into place. It is a nuisance. The pressure valve seems to protrude a bit to much into the underside of the top. Otherwise, it seems to work just fine. The bottom is nice and heavy and I haven't experienced any burning."
1,Rust,The cooker was barely three months old when I noticed all the screws had started rusting. I called up Presto for new screws. Then I noticed rust near the nozzle inside the cooker. I am going to return this product before something else starts rusting!
1,Not a Canner,"In the product description, it states ""Comes with rack for steaming food or for canning."" Yet on arrival, there is no way to regulate the pressure as needed for canning. I called Presto and they said it was not intended for canning. Now I have to return it."
2,"over pressure plug fell out and got lost, wobbly handle","Not worth it. My $16 Mirro from Walmart lasted 7 years; this one is falling apart after a couple of months. Presto has agreed to send me a new plug and handle without charge, so let's see..."
5,Where have I been all this time?,"The speed at which this pressure cooker cooks top round london broil is baffling. The meat comes out tender and succulent in around 30 minutes instead of the usual 2 hour cooking time. The best part is you don't have to stand watch and keep stirring. I haven't perfected the pressure cooker method yet so I first bring the liquid to a boil and make sure it doesn't burn and then place the lid. I also use the rack to make sure the meat doesn't stick as I had a great first experience with that. I used flour, a big no no apparently, and had to stop the cooking process because of the nice smell that arose from the pot, and find the burnt meat. For my purposes it's not worth using this for anything else but red meat as the other items cook rather fast on their own and I need to constantly add ingredients at different stages. But this is a real time saver!"
4,Thumbs up,"it is easy to use, saves time and marries and enhances the flavors while tenderizing. the size is perfect for me."
4,Nice pressure cooker,"For a pressure cooker, this is nice item. But the insert inside was made of aluminum, which I do not cook with. The screws that were used for the handles also started to rust after one washing."
1,Cheap Chinese Manufacture,"Handles are held on by one screw which will crack the cheap plastic if you tighten to much. Presto used to make a fine product ... then they shipped manufacture overseas to create a larger profit and you guesed it, cheap chinese product. Period."
5,Good Food,This cooker works great.I made a 4lb Boston Butt in 35 minutes and it turned out really tender and favorable. smoked pork chops and cabbage 4 minutes.
1,Gasket tastes like a rubber tire & cooked bad taste into food,"I was excited to get the Presto 6-qt stainless steel pressure cooker, especially given all the high ratings on Amazon. To our disappointment, I had to throw out the beans we cooked the first three times I cooked with this pressure cooker! :O The cooker worked great but the rubber gasket leached a horrible rubber taste into the food (and YES, I had washed the gasket before using it each time). I called Presto Customer Service & they are sending out a new gasket. I am hopeful the new one will be better quality and not leach a bad taste. I will give this product 5 stars if the problem is resolved."
4,Works Great but Cheap Steel,"This is the 3rd pressure cooker I have had. My previous one was also a presto. Although this pressure cooker works perfectly, the issues that many reviewers have mentioned regarding the metal base is, in fact, true.Whatever steel alloy they used for the base is not of high quality. Mine has not distorted (yet) but it shows signs of molecular stress. The shiny silver steel base has turned purple (rainbow of colors really) after the first use. The discoloration is not food staining or burning but is caused by changes to crystaline structure of the metal itself. This phenomenon has not effected the cooking efficiency or function of the pressure cooker yet but I am concerned.This is in contrast to my previous presto pressure cooker which did not discolor but distorted instead. Wierd. Good pressure cooker otherwise."
4,Not as friendly as Mirro,"The steam vent seems unnecessary, and involves the process in an extra step until timing starts, (when the weight begins jiggling). The cooker is also a bit more difficult to clean. But the stainless steel is better than aluminum. And it provides a very satisfactory product. It surely rates at least four stars."
5,Six quart pressure cooker,"I bought this pressure cooker on my son's recommendation, and he was right. It reduces the time to cook meat that tends to be tough, like venison, and after cooking the meat is more tender than if it is cooked all day in a Crock Pot."
2,Bottom too thin for good heat distribution,"Overall I was quite disappointed with this product. I had an aluminum pressure cooker by presto that was much better. The bottom of the Stainless is too thin for proper heat distribution, hence with low moisture volumescorching happens too fast."
2,Poor handle design,"The handles attached to the cooker by small, low quality screws. Each handle is being held only by a single screw. Also the post where the handle and screw are inserted is small and rounded and allows the handle to wiggle even after the screw is tightened, especially on the long handle. The long handle came off after the second use. It is going back to Amazon now."
5,Good value.,"I like the stainless steel - I'm somewhat adverse to aluminium for cooking. We used to have an 8qt. stainless steel in the same style, but it did not survive being put onto hig with no water inside! Made a mess of the cooktop with all the aluminium from the base melted over it.The stainless steel is easy to clean and the aluminium bottom spreads the heat evenly. Our 6qt cooker has a small handle on each side, unlike the one pictured today (14th July) with one big handle. It's the same diameter as the 8 qt., so the basket from our 8 qt. fits inside - it's better for lifting things out."
2,Not happy with quality,"I liked the looks of this cooker but when I assembled the handle,the screws were not tight enough and now after two months of use,the screws are getting more loose and have rusted as well. I am scared to hold the cooker from its handle now as it is loose and rusty.Did not expect this quality from Presto."
5,Good construction,I like this little cooker. It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods. The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research. I would recommend this. Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food. The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times. I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong. 20130130.
5,Ease and quality,"I have been very pleased with my new pressure cooker. It was easy to assemble, is easy to clean, and has made quality food every time I've used it. All the parts feel very sturdy. If I were to complain about anything, it's that the instruction manual is overly verbose. Other than that, this was a fantastic purchase."
3,Old tech that still works,"i bought this pressure cooker for mom hoping that since it's ""old school"" she would not have any trouble using it. Well I was wrong. When sliding the handles against themselves to close it she managed to get the pressure lock jammed and gave up. When I visited her and asked her about it it took me several tries to replicate the problem. Yes it's a minor problem but it never ocurrs with my ""Fagor"" pressure cooker. The only problem I have with the Fagor cookers is that they don't have a label for their size nor the required size of the gasket, nor how they measure it. Oh well the search for the perfect pressure cooker continues."
5,"Sturdy design, good performance!","The first important thing: stainless steel. Always avoid aluminum in food preparation and serving, otherwise you can end up suffering from health problems! Aluminum can accumulate in your neural system when it dissolves in acid food and enter your body with it. I just don't get it why aluminum has not yet been banned from being used in cooking untensils.The second important thing: size. 4 qt is a little too small, 6 qt is just fine for a bachlor like me (actually a family of two can also do with it), and 8 qt may be a little big.The third important thing: saving time. Nowadays who has enough time enjoying cooking... :("
4,"Works great, too big for one person","This pressure cooker works like a charm. My only complaint is that it is too big for cooking for a single person.If you are looking for a pressure cooker for yourself or maybe cooking for 2, thePresto 4-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerwill be plenty big enough. I wish I had gotten the smaller one."
1,short lived,"i've had this pressure cooker just over 4 months, using it about twice a week . it is already dead. doesn't jiggle any more and all the vapor escapes out the button on the handle. not worth it"
2,Loose Screws on Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker,"We have owned two Presto pressure cookers in the past & have been very happy with them. Last December we purchased a new Presto 6-qt. unit & have been very dissatisfied with it. Within a few weeks after first using the cooker the screw on the small handle had to be tightened after each use. Now, the screw on the large handle also works itself loose & must be tightened frequently. The instability of the handles made us feel very unsafe when using the cooker & we will be returning this item. A couple weeks ago we replaced the Presto with an Elite by FAGOR which we purchased from Macy's. So far, we are very pleased the replacement."
2,Watch out for slippery handles,"Item is good and arrived on time. Watch out for the handles. They are slippery and concave downward and you must hold them at both ends when hot or it could slip out and could be a safety issue if the pressure regulator falls off. Sorry, this item is not for a small framed person in the kitchen."
4,Don't Be Scared to Try Pressure Cooking,"Everyone--I mean everyone--thought we were nuts when we researching pressure cookers. ""It'll explode and you'll end up with pea soup on your ceiling!"", etc. Even with this simple, ""jiggle-top"" model, it has several valves and safety features in place to make sure that doesn't happen. The only disaster here would be human error. Most important is, just like microwave popcorn, don't leave the area--there are audio and visual cues you need to listen to so you know when to turn off the fire. Certainly we enjoy using this cooker--easy, fast meals in half the time--with a simple cooking method."
2,Bad design,"Had high hopes from the other reviews but disappointed. The pot handles are weak and I'm sure will break in time…The pot handle has one screw holding it to the pot and has come loose every time I've used it….It will eventuallybreak and then what? And I'm not buying or eating off of any cookware ""made in China"""
2,Mediocre Product at best,"I got this pressure an year ago and it worked well for a couple of months. Then the screws on the handles became loose and when I tried to tighten them, the handle cracked a little. The cooker was not holding pressure in and it was taking a very long time to cook food. Finally went and got an electric pressure cooker without the rubber washers."
2,"The handle is moveing around, can't fix it","The handle never can be tightened, it keep moving around, you have to screw it every time when you use it. the pressure lock sometimes not move up, you have to re-adjust it, so you have to be there to watch it. It is very inconvenience, unfortunately once you open the package, you can't return it. You have to take what you bought.But It can save a lot of time in cooking, you only needs about 45 mins for those food need to cook over 3-4 hours in a regular pan. The taste is better too."
5,Very good pressure cooker,Stainless steel pressure cooker is a very good product.Delivery was fast. I would recommend it to anyone looking fora good pressure cooker.
5,Great little pressure cooker!!!,I wanted a small pressure cooker and this one was perfect. Not to mention affordable. Have used it a few times and it works great.
4,it saves energy,I like it. But actually I can not fix the screw tight enough so that the body handle often looses a little. I don't know why.
5,Excelent product,"I am happy to have pressure cooker, I enjoy preparing my dishes now, in this version of stainlees steel cooking is better for health."
5,A must utensil in every kitchen,"Every family have to have this Presto cooker. I can cook any hard dry beans, chicken curry, rice etc. in this cooker in no time.Many ONE POT MEALS I have cooked in this Pressure Cooker. It is really time saving and food cooked in it taste better because we do not loose nutrients.My daughter being a busy college student, loves this Pressure cooker, because it saves lots of her cooking time."
5,Excellent cookware for two people plus!,"I've had 6 qt & 8 qt aluminum cookers since 1980 this one is my 7th pressure cooker, 4 qt presto and its stainless I love it, this is an awesome product with enough safety.I just got second 4 qt presto as gift for friend & a young couple for there ""house warm party""I am planning to replace 6 qt aluminum cooker with 6 qt stainless pressure cooker in future.Would certainly recommend this!Thanks Amazon for keeping your prices competitive, and that Free Shipping is GREAT!!!"
2,Cheap.... Too Thin & Light,"This pressure cooker would be just fine except for one major flaw. The bottom of the pot is really thin, which makes for uneven heating & burning on the bottom. I'm returning this item and will spend a few bucks more to get a heavier pot."
3,Misrepresentation: Not stainless steel,This works as a pressure cooker.But this is not fully stainless steel. Only the sides of the cooker are stainless steel. The bottom and the lid may have some stainless steel but they surely have cheaper iron as well.This can be tested with a simple magnet.
3,Very nice but....,"Very nice quality with a heavy heat spreader on the bottom.I previously owned the aluminum version of this pan and decided I would like the same pan made of stainless steel when I noticed what I thought was a strange flavor with certain foods. I don't know if this is a health problem or not, but I decided to move to stainless steel. Therefore, you can imagine my disappointment when I found that the anti-burn spacer that you put on the bottom is made of aluminum. At least I have the option of not using the spacer. I have to wonder what they are thinking (or not thinking) at Presto."
5,Excellent cooker,It is an excellent quality pressure cooker. Sturdy construction and the additional support tells you that it was made with quality and comfort in mind. I doubt if you will find a 4 quart pressure cooker with the additional support handle. Check this out before you buy another one.
1,Caution!!,We read previous reviews and bought it anyway. It worked once (after fiddling with the valve) and never again. We used an old Presto cooker for 20+ years before purchasing this one. I wish we kept the old one!!It doesn't work at all any more....we just use it as another pot.
5,Presto 6 quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker,"I have only used my pressure cooker one time, and it was the first time in my life that I have ever used a pressure cooker. It was awesome. The meat fell off of the bone and tasted so healthy. This is a great one. Large enough to do just about anything you want. Instruction booklet very clear. Beautiful stainless steel and a cinch to clean up. Much nicer than the aluminum ones I have also looked at. This is a very well made cooker. Nice, sleek style. Can't wait to use more, but want to research recipes on-line. There were many good, basic recipes in the instruction booklet, but I would like to see some that are more appealing to my family's appetite. I highly recommend the purchase ofthis pressure cooker, and I highly recommend checking out the prices on amazon.com"
5,great product,"I ordered this item to replace an existing Presto Pressure Cooker. I have had for over 15 years so I trust the Presto brand. I used my new cooker as soon as I got it and it cooked a lot faster than my old one. The only downside, I think this one is a bit noisier than my old Presto. Maybe that's because it's pressuring a lot better!The shipment was very quick and the item was as described."
4,Good item,"I only cook because I have to. I do like cooking with a pressure cooker. I use the small 4 qt. version. No problems so far. I purchased some random cooking with pressure cooker cook books, but end up using the booklet that came with the pressure cooker."
5,Pressure Cooker,"Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure CookerAn excellent unit. Heavy base, easy to clean, looks good and cooks great. Easy to store. An excellent purchase."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS MY 55 YEAR OLD PRESTO PRESSURE COOKER,TAKES MUCH LONGER TO START COOKING AS IS VERY VAGUE AS TO WHETER OR NOT COOL IMMEDIATELY. ALSO HAVE TO COOK SOME THING LONGER THAN IS CALLED FOR.
5,Presto 4-Quart Stainless Pressure Cooker,"Seal is tight, safety vents checked ok, nice size for 1-2 people, just great all around. Seem to be having difficulty with the recipes in the book allowing enough water."
3,Nice shape - Iffy performance,"The smaller base and tall sides are good. The pan holds a whole chicken, and fits on the back, mid-sized burner of my glass-top stove. Okay for water-based cooking, but tomato sauces will burn much easier than in my old aluminum Presto cooker. Also, the stainless steel takes longer to get pressurized. As ugly as the old girl was, I miss the aluminum cooker."
3,An OK cooker,"I've been using pressure cookers designed and made in China. They are regularly used for cooking rice and broth soups. I bought this 6-qt presto cooker because my old one was broken. It has all the functions I expected for a pressure cooker, such as secured pressure and safety. However, it is big and heavy for a single student. I checked their 4-qt ones, but don't like their design (same diameter as the 6-qt's but shallower). I really want one with smaller diameter (like 16-18"") and some depth. It might be due to its large size. The cooking is not saving my time as it used to be. It takes longer time to heat it up and reach full pressure (20-30 min). Besides, I feel the overpressure plug somehow prevents the cooker from reaching the highest pressure (not 100% sure). It is not my best choice, but OK for my daily use."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I am very happy with this pressure cooker, seems to be very well made (which is important for safety). I bought it to cook beans but it comes with a few recipes if you are new to pressure cooking so I tried a roast beef one and it came out great."
5,Nice product,This replaced a very old aluminum pressure cooker. The stainless is much nicer and it feels more substantial and safer.
4,Good cooker,"It's a good pressure cooker, we have already use it to cook and stew many decilious foods, my wife and child both like the food!"
3,Presto pressure cooker,"It is ok. i bought one last year and the screws rusted and loosened. i have not been able to find stainless steel screws that fit this. Amazon reimbursed me for the screws- like $2. I bought another and am hoping the screws don't loosen. I wish they would buy American stainless steel screws! The pot is stainless steel- so for the money it is a decent buy. I make beans in it every few days. Instead of taking 90 minutes to cook, takes 10 minutes!"
5,"Good price, good product.","Since I bought it to now, I have not had any problem to use it. Good price, Good size, Good product, Good.....I'm so glade I bought it."
1,terrible re-design of a great classic,"Handle is cheap plastic; handle doesn't attach firmly to pot, so you have to tighten frequently; pressure seal is unreliable. Generally not good quality"
2,"Poor design with flaws, may not last long","The product came in on time, the packaging itself was giving a very China made kind of feeling. We still did not lose confidence and assembled the handles of the cooker. Even that was also not very clearly explained in the manual. The handle on the lower pot has just one screw that attached it to the pot and the handle on the lid had two screws!! A Major design flaw. The pot has to hold a lot of weight with food in it and needed a firm support. So once the cooker was assembled, we tried lifting it empty the lower pot handle felt as it will yield to the pressure of the hand was not sturdy enough. It did not take us more than 5 minutes to realize that we have made a wrong choice and the product needs to be returned before it is too late. So here we are returning the Presto 6 Qt Stainless Steel pressure cooker. We figured that may be it is a better choice to add 20-30 bucks to your budget and go for a sophisticated decent brand."
3,Wrestling with Cover,"The cover is very difficult to put in place, I wrestle with it each time. I do not know if this is normal or not. Otherwise the cooking results are very good"
1,Scary! Melted the bottom.,"I used to agree with great comments of fellow consumers. Today I experienced very scary part of it. When my wife kept the cooker for little longer than used to be( less than 45min), we started smelling metal. When we went to kitchen we couldn't believe our eyes, the bottom of the cooker melted and dripped down as molten metal, ...it was so scary. I do have pictures of it all and will be going for consumer protection on this item. Just thought of let you all future buyers and current owners know about it."
4,"Great Cooker, Only Issue is the Screws Rusting","This is a great addition to my kitchen. It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal. I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also. Now I use these 3 cookers for everything. I am happy about ""stainless steel"" because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made, top of the line product for such a great price. Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while. Other than that, I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others."
5,Should have bought one years ago!,"I am very happy with the quality, price, and versatility of this pressure cooker. I have made some great tasting quick meals in a pinch, and use it as a 6 quart sauce pan as well. It works well with my induction cooktop. As with any pressure cooker be careful with moving it!"
4,"assembly required, the handle attaches by 1 screw!?","overall great product, but you have to screw on the handle... by only 1 screw! i predict that this will loosen over time. this is a risk because this handle is what locks the pressure cover! yikes!"
5,pressure cooker,I have cooked with a Presto pressure cooker since I was ten years old. I have wanted the stainless steel model for some time. I now have it and am happy about it. It arrived through the mail quickly in good shape. I am most satisfied.
5,"If you cook , You need one!!",Excellent Product!! Now I know why Mom had one so many years ago.Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker saves time and moneyand the food is outstanding. One of my best investments.
2,Not the Best...,"I have owned pressure cookers in the past... This one is probably my least favorite. The stainless steel is too thin; The first time I cooked in it, my food burned and sticked to the bottom (This had never happened in any of my other pressure cookers). The cover has turned colors.. Which makes me think that the cover is Aluminum!I wouldnt recommend it if you cook in a pressure cooker on a weekly basis like I do.."
2,its much more smaller than what i expected,"i recommend everyone purchasing this product to check the size well.the one i had before was much thicker, and thus did not burned food... this one does if the temperature is high.good to cook beans and anything that has much water."
5,"The Little Cooker that ""COULD""!","I've been using Pressure Cookers for years, and was under the assumption that ""size does matter""... Well, guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things, I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!! I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them, but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
1,You get what you pay for,"Bought this on November 13 last year. Have used it 10 (that's ten) times. I only hand wash it; I do not use the dishwasher for cleaning it. I use a dishrag plus a fabric coated sponge for washing dishes. No scratchers have been used on it. It is currently showing rust spots around the top edge. Fortunately I did not pay a lot for it, but it still was too high a price to pay for a piece of cookware that basically only lasted a little over 2 months as I don't wish to eat rust.It is also very lightweight compared to the old pressure cooker my mother had for over 40 years; maybe that is why the metal isn't very high quality.Firm believer in the old adage that you get what you pay for; my bad. Have ordered another brand that is pricier. I am not in the financial position to pay more for one specialty pan than I did for my entire set of stainless pots and pans, so we will see how this next one works out."
4,Works Well,"Pretty good in quality and easy to use. I used pressure cookers before many years ago. This stainless steel one offers the convenience and time-saving in cooking, especially in cooking those foods that take a long time to cook. The size fits the needs of small to median families well. Personally, I would like it to be a little larger in diameter and shorter in height."
1,"weak product, unlike it's predesessor of several years ago..","Thin metal burns easily and stains easily and VERY difficult to clean...I should have bought a better quality, much more durable (more expensive) item.Save your money, buy something else. Something of better metal (mettle).david"
4,First time pressure cooker user.,My sister-in-law recommended Presto because her inlaws had used several other brands and Presto was their favorite. As a first time user I have been very pleased with the results. I rarely use my expensive waterless cookware because this does a better job.
5,A lot of fun and very funny,The cartoons in this book are rioutous. Totally irreverent and a hit with this lifelong Catholic. Highly recommended for those of any faith and even those without ;)
4,"Rina Piccolo: Outrageous cartoons, attack dog mode!","Rina Piccolo is a rarity: a woman who sometimes writes cartoons in the mode of male stand-up comics, in the tradition of Lenny Bruce--offbeat outrage. The first strip I ever saw by Rina was a drawing of King Kong atop the Empire State Building, with the huge gorilla thinking to himself that his genitals fit perfectly into the window. It was so absurd that I had to laugh. I could also however imagine someone clicking her tongue disdainfully in reaction to the cartoon.Rina Piccolo delights in taking cliched images and providing a bizarrely twisted caption. If you are easily offended, Rina is not for you. But if you believe there's no such thing as a ""sacred cow"" you may find her sense of lunacy refreshing and unique. This is not a gentle ribbing of The Church, but a skewering. Will recent church scandals make these cartoons more socially acceptable? Perhaps."
2,Energy can't save poor execution,"As a huge YOT fan since the beginning, this record was a very difficult one for me. This album features some of the worst production I have ever heard. Basement tapes sound better than this. Furthermore, the instruments are often out of sync with the drums (which is odd, since I know these guys can play), and the vocals off time from the rest of the band. As I listened, I wondered if they had even bothered to listen to what they'd recorded before mixing and pressing the record, it's that bad.Despite this, you can tell that most of these songs would be hardcore classics if only they could be realized sonically, but the production is just too disappointing. ""Flame Still Burns"" and ""Slow Down"" would have been brilliant, for example.If you're new to YOT, pick up ""Can't Close My Eyes"" or ""Break Down the Walls"" - this one is for fans only."
5,Wow,A friend of mine bought the DVD and popped it in for us to watch. Wow. It's amazing! Captivating! Can't say enough good things about it! Underworld is great!
5,"Underworld's ""Everything"" is great!",This live concert video takes place in a huge stadium and has incredible sound quality. The vibe at the stadium packed with thousands is awesome and you'll feel like you're there! This is a must buy for any Underworld/techno/rave fans!
4,"Solid stuff from a great, great group","I'd always been a huge underworld fan but I had never seen them live so I figured this was the next best thing. A great DVD overall. Great shots of the group performing, their setups, how they make the music they do and, of course, the grooving fans. Great features too like the Tomato Art collective video art. The whole DVD is different songs performed live at different places and some might find the whole live format kind of tiresome. It would have been nice to see things such as music videos from the guys but hey that's why its called Underworld LIVE right? If you're an Underworld fan and you don't have this DVD I've got two words for you. Why not?"
4,Everything... is more than I thought!,"I have always loved the tunes that Underworld cranks out. Since I never make it to a concert, I thought the DVD would be cool. It has some PC features to make your own video effects over the video if you decide to play it on your computer. Its a bit old-school in that regard since PC software mutates and upgrades so quickly... it's nothing wee have not seen before. The concert however is great fun, and viewed on a robust surround sound home entainment system with the lights off... well it is almost, almost as good as being there. Like watching football on TV.. better coverage and all that. I watch/listen to it more often than I thought I would as well... If you are into club tunes and techno, this is good to have."
3,Not the trippiest thing ever,"A friend told me to watch this because he thought it was the trippest thing he'd ever seen. I wouldn't say that, but it's still pretty cool. The music and graphics are nicely choreographed."
4,A very much needed book but..,"This is a very much needed book that would hopefully motivate many therapists to accept themselves as humans and to know their limitations. However, it did give me a sense that the author was trying to create a ""cook book"" despite him saying that it was not his intend. It felt as if he was trying to predict every possible case scenario instead of raising a more fundamental question such as what therapy work is and what it is not? I believe, it is more important to have this fundamental discussion instead of concentrating on countless little details, because many taboo topics come from therapists' mindless attitude toward their work in general, when they cannot define for themselves what therapy is, how it promotes healing and what therapeutic relationship is and isn't."
3,casual,"I enjoy crafts and entertaining so I read alot of books and magazines with ideas. I found this book to have several cute ideas, but since I read alot of books, these ideas were dated and old to me. I was somewhat disappointed, but will keep searching for crafts, entertaining, and hospitality books via Amazon."
4,nice overview (review by a physicist),"well written, although sometimes complex, chapters basically covering the state-of-the-art in cosmology by numerous physics luminaries. I totally disagree with other reviewers assertions that this is a ""stealth"" creationist tome...since the vast majority of the authors have only presented what is empirical assertions/hypothesis backed up by the latest mathmatics and data, to this point; and many of the authors have no creationist leanings what-so-ever....and BTW, who cares who funds it?...I enjoyed this book."
3,A pricey curate's egg,"I was tempted to give only two stars because the book is rather pricey for a collection of articles most of which are freely downloadable from the internet, sometimes in greater depth or detail. However, on their own merits, these are a mixed bag of articles of varying quality that have been roped together to celebrate J.A.Wheelers seminal influence.Some of the chapters are quite good as far as they go, and roughly speaking the first half of the book on quantum reality is by far the best, after which the standard drops off somewhat. There is quite a bit of whacky nonsense in the latter half, amongst the worst of which is Max Tegmark's loony multiverse chapter which packs in more misinformation, non-sequiturs, faulty logic and sloppy reasoning per paragraph than any piece I have ever come across before purporting to be physics.Overall, fairly interesting and stimulating but so is browsing the internet where most of this and much more can be found."
3,Stealth creationist tome???,The fact that the science credentials of the contributors to this book are/were impeccable makes this book worth checking out. My question is why at no point in either the reviews or publicity of this book is it not exposed that not only is this book the product of a symposium arranged and paid for by the Templeton Foundation but one editor is a Templeton Foundation employee and another is a Templeton science award winner. While the former should make you want to check out a library copy the latter should be considered before a prospective purchase.
1,Kindle version -- only 4 clippings available,"Amazon doesn't tell you ahead of time that the Kindle version only allows 4 clippings -- an absurd restriction for any book, much less non-fiction -- buyer beware!"
5,"Founder Fathers: Great leaders, great book","Phillips has done an excellent job telling the story of the American Revolution. He captures the courage and heroism of our Founding Fathers. The battles scenes are well-told and convey the daring spirit of the revolutionaries. Moreover, he explains how our early patriots developed their vision of an independent nation and communicated their message to the public. At the same time, he clearly lists key leadership principles used by the founding fathers during each historical event. While reading this book, I was also reading a much longer book on George Washington. The Phillips book better captures George Washington's leadership qualities, and does so in far fewer pages. The leadership principles are explained in ways that are relevant to today's organizational leaders."
1,Do Not Waste YOur Time or Money,"Knowing a little bit of history can be very dangerous. This book is crammed full of errors, mistakes and inaccuracies. You can't learn history by just reading the executive summary. Worst of all, you can't write history by stringing together fifteen chapters of ""to do"" lists. If you want to learn about leadership, read D.H. Fischer's Washington's Crossing."
1,Not Good,"I did not find ANYTHING new or interesting about leadership in Mr. Phillip's book. More or less a bunch of tired old cliche's in hardcover or softcover - your choice. Save your money, I wish I had."
5,"""higher ,higher feel the fire,she burns at the stake like a witch!!""","i've been wrecking my neck to over kill for i guess about 17 years now & had never heard their debut. i finaly picked it up back in march of this year & damn is it good! its my new favorite over kill.i can't say its technicaly the best of their catalog .i do think its the most entertaining. the original lineup fresh from the underground,loaded w/great songs & its remastered.a MUST for over kill freaks or headbangers for that matter."
2,Lousy Procuction but cool Songs,Not the best OVERKILL album but worth buying for collectors of one of the GREATEST THRASH BANDS to ever play!!!
4,I felt the fire. The fire felt good,"Other than Killing is My Business, Above the Ashes, and The Ultra-Violence, this is one of my favorite debuts from one of my favorite bands. Let me simply state this fact I love Overkill. And Feel the Fire is an amazing album. It is so energetic and bad ass. Bobby Blitz's vocals are so unique yet awesome! He really fits in with this band, especially when they have violent or sadistic lyrics. Favorite tracks: Feel the Fire, Rotten to the Core, and Hammerhead. This is a must have for anyone who really loves thrash metal. Really impressive debut album!!"
1,Feel The Fire? Throw this one in the fire....,"The worst of the Overkill albums. Nothing here to indicate what this band would become. Hindsight is always 20/20. And that's a good thing, if this had been my first Overkill album, it would have been my last."
5,Excellent,"Good stuff. Great riffs on songs like ""Rotten to the Core"" and ""Hammerhead"". Classic thrash and a great CD to revisit if you need a break from the death metal growl. Not as strong overall as ""Taking Over"", but still belongs in any metal fans collection."
5,ANOTHER CLASSIC !!,"'' OVERKILL '' HAS BEEN AROUND LONGER THAN MOST METAL BANDS , AND UNLIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS THEY HAVEN'T GONE COMMERCIAL AT ALL ..ALBEIT THAT THEY PUT IN A BIT OF MELODY , THEY STILL SHRED WITH A FEROCIOUS INTENSITY RARELY SEEN TODAY ! THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS CD - THEIR DEBUT - SO GREAT ! IT IS FAST , RAW ,AND AGRESSIVE, AND POUNDS YOU TILL YOUR EARS ARE GOING TO BLEED !!ALL OF THEIR CDS SHOW THEIR SLIGHT PROGRESSION , BUT THEY NEVER LOSE THEIR UNIQUE SOUND OR STYLE THAT MAKES THEM ''OVERKILL''. SO IF YOU WANT THE CD THAT STARTED IT ALL , THEN LOOK NO FURTHER ..EVERY SONG WILL HAVE YOU THRASHING AND HEADBANGING WITH SHEER DELIGHT !SO PICK IT UP TODAY ! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT ONE BIT ! IT 'LL HAVE YOU COMING BACK FOR MORE .. I GUARANTEE IT ......."
5,Best of the best,"""Feel the fire"" is the one of great albums in power/thrash metal I ever heard. It's in one line with Sanctuary ""Refuge Denied"", Testament ""The Legacy"", Anthrax ""Spreading the Desease""."
4,8/10,"The film was outstanding, had a ""Taxi Driver"" feel to it, as the conflict is similar in some ways. Sean Penn acted beautifully, as always. Naomi Watts, having done 21 Grams with Penn before, was able to bring something to the table. Don Cheadle adds a great supporting role, for what it's worth. I also give all the credit in the world to first time director Niels Mueller for putting together a great piece of work.A few problems I had with the film is, I thought they tried to use the whole 9/11 happening to their fullest advantage and attract audiences. I also thought that Penn's character, Samuel Bicke, became somewhat annoying as the film went on.Anyway, I definetly recommend it. This movie isn't for the average watcher, as you have to actually think every now and then. Though, if your idea of good movies is Ben Stiller and Will Smith, perhaps you should check out the latest action flick. :]"
3,Interesting,An interesting movie (though sometimes too lagging) Penn is good in his performance. The ending is also disturbing but good.
4,"NIELS MUELLER, OPUS 1",***1/2 2004. Co-written and directed by Niels Muller and produced by AlfonsoChildren of Men (Widescreen Edition)Cuarón and Leonardo DiCaprio. An idealistic salesman tries to live according to his ideas. He soon loses his job and he is rejected by his own family. This depressing drama develops a theme rarely seen in the American film production: the story and the rebellion of a man forgotten by the American dream. Astounding Sean Penn performance.
3,Penn-ding departure.,"For some reason the makers choose to reduce the culpability of the protaganist by making him appear mentally ill during the execution of his crime, thus muddying any moral point they were hoping to make."
3,Recalls both Taxi Driver and Falling Down,"Sean Penn is well cast as the increasingly disaffected salesman who's life at work, broken marriage and friendships are straining him to the breaking point. He begins as a sort of everyman struggling through the 70's while Richard Nixon is a constant backdrop on newscasts that are playing while His life is slowly unraveling. The connection to Nixon is established as Penn's character begins to see dishonesty and lies as the root of his troubles.While not as socially aliented as Travis Bickel in Taxi Driver , Penn's character is more a cross btween him and Michael Douglas' character in Falling Down. Sort of a regular guy gone terribly wrong as the reaction to an endless series of indignities that he suffers.Well acted and worth checking out."
2,You can show the downward spiral without spiralling down with it,"I think this film is too attached to the main character, it becomes a bit dangerous because the pychosis of the main character becomes a bit too identifiable. In this sense the film is almost giving the psychosis its approval.That I believe shows that the film has crossed an important line. The ending is quite sadistic. Its a shame that the final impression is one of evil because most of the film is quite tragic and brings out compassion from the viewer.Because of the content later in the film I cannot recommend it."
3,Penn pins it,"I just finished watching ""The assassination of Richard Nixon"" on daytime television. This is the third movie I have seen featuring Sean Penn (others being Fast Times at Bridgemont High and Mystic River) Mystic River was what it was thanks to the much inspired efforts of Penn. In this movie, he predicates the life of a middle class man perfectly. His eyes emote his plague in the film, his voice and dubbing was superb and I could relate to him.There were three times this film made me go ""whoa"" The direction makes it worth watching.IMDB.com's average rating for this movie - 7.2/10My Rating - 6.9/10This movie came out in 2004 so it isnt old at all. Definitely worth watching."
1,Does not fit 80GB 5g ipod,"Our 80 gb 5th generation is too thick for this holder. It says on the box that it fits 30gb, 60 gb and the 80gb, but in my experience, they are wrong. The 80gb fits perfectly in the clear part but there is not enough space left over the the lid to click on, so it is completely useless. Live and learn."
4,Late review...,"I've had this product for a couple of years now. It has remained mostly free of scratches aside from the normal wear and tear. I have an original 5G 80gb ipod, which by today's standards is relatively thick, so I'm not sure if the package has been adapted to fit the newer models. My ipod has remained in pristine condition as a result of the case seen here. Some (about 5% of the speaker systems encountered) have required a removal of the case to get stereo sound ability. Otherwise all chargers, headphones, etc... have fit perfectly while still in the case. My ipod looks as new as the day i bought it due to the tight seal provided and that's what you'll get if you buy this one."
1,Don't Bother,"If you really want to learn the art of computer animation, I would suggest Blender, it is far more stable, the quantity and quality of available tutorials is superior, and it's free. I used to use A:M, the short comings are numerous. I won't list them all here, some have already been listed. I'm not bitter, I'm not a troll, just my experience, Blender is better than A:M."
1,Unqiue ideas but poor software quality,"This runs OK on a windows machine but crashes often. On a Mac machine it is veryunstable. Some of the conceps are quick and unqiue and not too many otherpackages in this price range offer these features. Poser 6 is a better deal, orCinema 4D for Mac owners. Windows users can also use either of those but they also have access to 3D Max."
4,"Great book, but watch out -- it's got two titles!","FYI, for those of you who have been to the Anne Frank House:Except for the cover, Inside Anne Frank's House is COMPLETELY IDENTICAL to the deluxe edition of a book sold in the Netherlands and on annefrankhouse.org under the title, Anne Frank House: A Museum with a Story. (Here's the link to the other version: [...])It's a beautiful book, well made and with many, many large photos, and I heartily recommend it. But it's not so beautiful as to warrant inadvertantly buying two, like I did. ;)"
5,"We Remember, If Only We Would Learn","It's an ordinary house, not spectacular at all. It wouldn't be worth photographing at all except for the extraordinary young lady who lived here and who kept a diary during one of those times when the devil was loose on the earth and good men did nothing to stop him.But because of this young lady and her extraordinary diary this house is a monument, a church if you will, that commemorates not just this girl but all of those who went with her, and all of those who tried to help them.The book itself is beautifully done, not only a photographic guide but a history, a memorial in its own right with quotations and photographs of objects displayed in the actual exhibition. ==Let us never forget!Let us also remember the other holocausts that followed to prove that we didn't learn enough: Rwands, Cambodia, Ethnic Cleansing in former Yugoslavia, and what may happen in Iraq between the Sunni, Shiite, and Kurds."
2,Fun for a short while only,"As much as my daughter liked this software initially, she quickly fell out of love with it as it doesn't have longevity. I guess most science software can't but I still feel like it wasn't worth the cost when I could have went to a few free webpages for interactive science programs. I also think this software is for 6-9, not 7-11yrs old. I don't think I would recommend it unless your child has no access to the internet."
2,does not fit in a Motorola v60,"I bought this because my current battery would die after 5 to 15 minutes of talk time on a full charge (after sitting in a closet for a year). I was thrilled to get a battery that would make my mobile phone truly mobile again. I opened it up, put it in my phone, tried to close the battery cover and it would not close. Not even close. If I forced it really hard I could get it to just close over the latch, but it was actually bending the plastic of the phone and the latch would probably be in danger of popping off at any moment.The battery is about 50% thicker than the standard battery for a Motorola v60. Might be great for the extra battery life, but bad if you can't get get the battery cover on your phone. I give it two stars because the battery may work fine for all I know, but it won't fit in a v60."
1,somewhat displeased,"when installilng the battery I realized that it was thicker than the original battery, however I was able to close the cover with a great deal of pressure . I was also disappointed that a charge only lasted about 15 minutes of talking. Sadly to say, my first experience with amazon.com has not been an ideal one."
3,not too sure...,"This Video is ok, but I wouldn't use it more than twice a week. Most of the excercises strain the knees if you aren't careful. It left me sore for a few days after, and I've been doing step aerobics and running for 7 years."
5,Great marketing food for thought,"Zaltman's How Customers Think provides an easy-to-read work on consumer behaviour and market research. Illustrated with anecdotes from a range of brands Zaltman talks through the benefits and pitfalls of different research methods, together examples of the `law of unintended consequences'. Its a really easy read, I hammered through it on a business trip to Glasgow."
1,Worst book Ever,"I dont know if this is a marketing book!!Too much text for less benefitsIdeas are not integrated with each other specially when connecting science with MarketingNot too many marketing examples.Even the examples did not show what where the exact results of the specified theories conductedAt the end of the book he fills it with text about creativity, oh please!!! this is supposed to be a book about marketing and how I am supposed understand customers not how to be creativeOne more thing, he argues that products are how they are perceived in the mind of the customer and not what the products are in reality. Well, this is a very old idea, maybe the writer should read books for Al Ries and Jack Trout about Positioning."
2,Watered down with....,"This book has some good concepts, but the majority of the text deals with the workings of the brain, neurophysiology and neuropsychology. The book is entirely mislabeled as a business/marketing book when only 10% of the overall text addresses business, marketing or even consumer science. It is a cleverly disguised neuropsychology book."
4,Unique book,"I've been recently shopping around for good marketing books, and I was glad I picked this one off the shelf. This book is well written and the concepts are explained to the reader very clearly. Very useful if you're in the marketing biz."
2,Turgid,"I'm an avid reader of business and marketing books, but I found this turgid. I've actually given up. I can tell there are some interesting thoughts in there, but my eyes just glaze over. Could be just me."
2,Warmed over goulash of random marketing findings,"This is a disjointed, rambling and under-edited compendium of topics from market research. The author swings from brand development to product development to service experience as if they were fundamentally about the same thing. The number of U.S. automotive examples in the book is truly dispiriting since last time I checked, the market share loss was continuing unabated in spite of all of these allegedly successful studies. His section on focus group usefulness is far too negative. There are far better topic specific books on the market about brand, product development and service experience development. Buy those."
2,Does not deliver ...,"In one way I enjoyed reading the book as it pulled together various studies and experiments related to aspects of cognitive psychology and the use of some techniques (e.g. metaphors), but in the end the book simply does not deliver on the title.For me, the failure of the book is that it does not propose any coherent, overall model of ""How Customers Think"" (or more importantly ... how purchase decisions are sub-consciously arrived at), just simply some interesting observations on different aspects of thought with little or not integration. I suspect that most people would read the book and think ""interesting ... but what the heck do I do now?""I'm waiting for a better book on the subject to come along ..."
2,great book for the right person;a snoozer for the rest,"I wanted to like this book. Great title,enticing blurbs,a respected author.And,if I was into a very detailed read on the chemistry of our brains,the nature of human thought,and the mechanics of how we perceive,then I would have loved it.And if those topics are of interest to you, buy this book.But don't get this book if you are looking for practical, hands on advice on marketing you or your services. The book's best chapter is ""Memory,Metaphor,and Stories"" and it has some useful concepts that you can put into practice,but no where near as useful as books like the Story Factor by Annette Simmons."
4,Outrageous Detour,"This is a sassy, sexy, very entertaining novel. The reader is swept along with the novel's ebullient characters toward an ultimate mystical adventure. Yet amidst all the fun runs a steady thread of human wisdom and a very seriously-held purpose.A very enjoyable read!"
4,widow's weeds by tristanea add to your darkwave collection,"This is a group of great talent and musical ability, the only negative being in harsh male vocal overkill, less of that would make it perfect: Recomended group for the dark music lover."
4,Very Well Done!,"I have had this album for quite some time now and it still holds a special place in my heart! Continuing where they have left off, Tristania prove once and for all that they can hold their own among the more respected acts in the genre. Don't believe me? ""My Lost Lenore"" has got to be one of the greatest songs ever composed! It is perfect in every way and definitely worth the price of the disc alone...The deep and well composed (sometimes multi-movement) music is complemented by the now standard operatic female and brutal male vocals- but it works in perfect harmony! Though Tristania have lost some of their glimmer in the later years as the lineup changed, 'Widow's Weeds' remains one of the most inspired and important recordings in the genre (definitely challenging the more respected and admired Theatre of Tragedy masterpieces)!"
3,"Very good starter, Rehash for experienced players.","The Hero Builder's Guidebook does some in-depth exploration of each class by race, and offers some excellent food for thought in creating new characters. In general, all roleplayers should use this kind of character creation process.However, there is just not enough new material for experienced players. The tables of birth location, community, relatives, background elements, and story hooks are all useful, but may not justify the purchase for every player. The alignment quiz is a nice touch, especially for player-DM arguments about ""I am so Chaotic Good!"" ""Well, you're acting Chaotic Neutral, buddy!"" and so on.I recommend making one purchase of this product for a gaming group, and then sharing it around the table.--Steve Semler, RPG Editor, SciFiHaven.com"
5,Great for everyone,"I bought this book against the opinion of everyone I knew. It turned out that this book really changed my perspective on characters in role-playing games. As a long time player of D&D, I found that the insights on different class/race combinations was extreamley helpful in overcomming my fantasy realm racial stigmas. I never really liked to play anything except human characters till I read this book and explored the interesting flavor of the class combos.If you want to get a really helpful book for creating a memorable character, buy this book."
4,Great Little Book,"I saw this book for cheap so I added it on to another order. It's a fun little read, with very little in the way of rules and a lot more on the theoretical application of role playing character development in D&D.; Because it's rules extra lite, there isn't any conflict using this stuff if you play 3.5Also, 4e sucks.That is all"
1,For the new player only,I am a new player and even I can tell that this book is not worth your time nor money. The background generator and the list of names are the only items of value. Most of the text is fluff and not useful to the newest of players (a.k.a. me). I was shocked when I saw how thin this book is.
3,Disappointment for an experienced player.,I was fairly disappointed when I received this suppliment. This will help players and DM's that are new to the AD&D world as a whole but will provide little new or useful information for an experienced player. I feel this suppliment for the new 3rd Edition AD&D and may prove useful in character creation and devolpment for new players but will provide little for those who have been gaming for some time. The alignment section is a little interesting but overall I would not recommend this for those of you who are experienced gamers. I am glad though that Wizards of the Coast have gone back to Greyhawk where AD&D should be.........GREYHAWK LIVES!!
3,Don't write it off.,"While the book is obviously designed for beginners, it has value for those experienced, as well. For instance, having recently bought the book, I created my first character with the book today. For this campaign, I chose a sun-elf wizard. Normally, I just would have given him a random name from the tables in the PH, Aramil Xiloscient, for instance. However, using the tables in the HBG, his name is Selwyn ""Windrider"" Kavalion. Also, previously, I would have just assumed he was the son of farmers,or something like that. Now he is the son of wealthy arcane parents, who had an arcane ancestor, both grandparents living, an affinity for magic, and the list goes on and on. And if you just are out of ideas, you can roll the histiry and stuff first, and create a character from the profile created. So don't write this book off as just for beginners."
3,Excellent for New Players!,"Although I thought this book was overpriced and worthless at FIRST, I now realize that it is valuable as a resource for brand new players who have no clue what D&D is all about. My friends and I just started playing D&D 3E after playing 2E for several years. My girlfriend became interested but she had no clue what we were talking about half the time. This is the perfect book for someone in that exact position who needs to understand the differences between a fighter and a monk, or a cleric and a wizard. It also explains races, and professions as well as giving the DM and players guidelines for creating a detailed character background. If you can find it for a decent price online, snatch it up. But don't pay full price. *wink*"
1,Cheap? yes. Usefull? Not so much.,You can pick this book up for $2.00 or less. It is 3rd edition not 3.5 and the cover has the only color pics you will see. The tables for character creation are vague in the extreme. The only good thing about them is that they are a quick and easy way to add a little (not a lot) flair to an NPC. Other reviews said that this product is good for beginers. I would say save your money and make up your own tables.
4,About Modern Japanese dilemma,"I haven't read this book, but I just read about it in Mainichi Daily News online site. I'm going to paste in a little of what they say, because the book looks very interesting and I am going to buy it soon. Project Kaisei,"" the second mystery novel from Japanese author Michiro Naito, deals with a number of complex issues currently facing Japan, such as the critical state of the economy and the growing military threat from its Asian neighbors. It offers a glimpse of modern-day Japan as seen from the eyes of the protagonist, and puts forth the real possibility of the resurgence of fascism on the archipelago which could lead to nuclear armament. The note says that the author has a PhD in nuclear physics, but works as an investment analyst."
2,Not about the Battle of Stalingrad.,"As indicated by another reviewer, this movie only tells of what happened before the battle of Stalingrad. If you are looking for a movie on the Battle itself, don't spend the cash on this one."
5,Summerslam 1998,Summerslam is second only to Wrestlemania in the world of professional wrestling. Summerslam 1998 felt like it truly was. Fans and celebrities of all kinds flocked to the World's Most Famous arena Madison square Garden to witness the Conclusion to the Highway to Hell.(European Championship Match)D'Lo Brown vs. Val Venis- 3.5/5The Oddities w/Insane Clown Posse and Luna vs. Kaenti- 2/5(Hair vs. Hair) Jeff Jarrett vs. X-Pac- 4/5Sable and Edge vs. Marvelous Marc Mero and Jaqueline- 3/5(Lions Den Match) Ken Shamrock vs. Owen Hart- 4/5(Tag Team Title Match) The New Age Outlaws vs. Kane and Mankind- 3.5/5(Intercontinetal Title Ladder Match) The Rock w/ Mark Henry vs. Triple H w/ Chyna- 5/5(WWF Title Match) The Undertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin- 5/5Overall this event great. It had everything a good PPV needed. It was the second best PPV of 1998 after Wrestlemania XIV and one of the greatest Summerslams of all time!
3,this is da match da made rock and hhh famous,da ladder matchda rock and hhh did great as 2 heavyweight superstars go hand 2 hand n what is widely considered as a cruiserweight like gimmick this match was almost perfect enough 2 close this 1 of da best matches of all time yes sir rock was just starting 2 get n da groove 2 have a run of good 2 great matches with almost anybody this was that time hhh was startin 2 be a bigger version of hbk of puttin great matches with almost anybody put these 2 togther n a good gimmick is likely 2 receive a 4 star outing this was a ****1/2 star outling
3,Summer is about to get a lot hotter!,"The 1998 Summerslam featured Austin and Taker battling in the main event - what! how many times have these two gone at it? This is yet another event where the WWF wants us to go over the same matches and storylines over and over again - disappointing, but a great under-card."
4,I don't think it is one of the big Pay Per Views!!!,"Stone Cold and the Undertaker both fought hard but the Undertaker should have won. The other matches are all right, with some of the big name supurstars."
4,Lost a star for.....,"them annoying oddities and kaientie!!! That was the only bad match. Every other match was good to great. The ladder match, though not as good as Michaels vs. Razor, is the highlight of yet another great WWF PPV."
4,WWF Summerslam 1998,"WWF European TitleD'lo Brown (C) vs Val VenisBoring opener. Bad start to this PPV. 5/10The Oddities vs KaietaiDecent match with funny spots. 6/10Hair vs Hair MatchX-Pac vs Jeff JarrettPretty good match. Good fill in match. 7/10Edge and Sable vs Marc Mero and JacquelineGood match. Sable puts up another great performance. 7/10Lion's Den MatchKen Shamrock vs Owen HartWasn't as good as it was hyped up to be, but decent. 7/10WWF Tag Team TitlesMankind and Kane (C) vs New Age OutlawsDecent match, would have been better if all participants wrestled. 7/10Ladder Match for WWF Intercontinential TitleThe Rock (C) vs Triple HGreat match. Top 5 match of 98. Might wanna purchase tape for this. 10/10WWF ChampionshipStone Cold Steve Austin (C) vs The UndertakerWasn't that good. But the leg drop for Taker is memorable. 8/10WWF Summerslam 1998 was hyped up to be a great event, but was REALLY disappointing. Ladder match was the only thing great on this tape. 7/10"
3,SOME GOOD MATCHS,DONT GET THIS TAPE IF YOU ONLY ARE GETTING IT FOR SCSA VS UNDERTAKER ITS NOT THAT GOOD OF A MATCH.
3,A good show!,"Dlo Brown over Val Venis by DQ after Val shoved the ref...Val later gave the ref the money shotOddities win over Kaintai with double choke slamsXpac over JJ after he hit JJ with his own guitar..JJ gets his hair cut..Howard Finkel and Headbangers helped.Sable and Edge over Mero and Jackie..Edge picked up Sable and slammed her onto MeroShamrock defeats Owen with the ankle lock submission hold.Owen tapped out..Severn walked out during the end of the match.NAO win over Mankind with a piledriver onto one of the tag belts.Mankind wrestled this match by himself..After the match Kane appeared in the dumpster that NAO had brought out,he had a sledgehammer and hit Mankind with it.HHH wins the IC belt in the ladder match against The Rock..Henry threw powder into HHH's eyes.Chyna came in and gave the low blow to the Rock enabling HHH to get the belt..SCSA over UT with the stunner..After the match UT handed SCSA the belt."
5,This is possabyl one of the best pay-per-views by the WWF!,"From start to finish this PPV has a match for any wrestling fan. Fan favorites from Val Venis to Stone Cold Steve Austin to heels such as the Undertaker this PPV is loaded with action. Just some of the matches consist of a handicap tag team match for the tag straps, a ladder match that puts HHH aginst The Rock for the IC belt, and a great Heavyweight Championship match that puts Stone Cold Steve Austin against The Undertaker!"
5,The most awesome ppv ever.,"I have been a WWf fan for eleven years and I have seen a heck of a lot of pay per views in my time, but this one is by far the best. It had tremendous hype and the WWF delivered with a bang."
4,"Very good card, but could not get the job done","I am a huge WWF fan, and I rented this video because he matches looked very enttertaining. The first two matches were horrendous. D-Lo Brown and Val Venis took forever, in what was a very boring match. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through Oddities-Kaientai again. X-Pac-Double J and Edge,Sable-Mero-jackie were mediocre matches. The Lion's Den Match was cool but I would not want to see another one. Mankind-Outlaws was weak, considering it was Falls Count Anywhere & for the gold. The Rock and Triple H was the highlight of the night. That saved the whole SummerSlam. Austin and Undertaker was nothing special, just a good match, not great."
4,A Very good performance,"This was a great ppv.The ladder match stole the show aswell as Undertakers legdrop through the table.Great plancha by Edge.You wont believe the bumps that The Rock and HH Take in the ladder match,being as they are not hardcore wrestlers.Another successful addition to the best series of wwf/wwe ppv's-SummerSlam."
4,Awesome!,All the matches were great.The Hair bout was unreal.The laddermatch stole the show and the Oddities/kaientai bout was Hilarious.
4,Rankin & Bass Do King Kong,"Just as Rankin & Bass had tackled Tolkien before Jackson did, they also did a King Kong movie. Once again we have a remote island where Kong lives. He also meets a blonde beauty and falls in love. But this version has more. We have an evil villain who has constructed a giant robot Kong to aid him in his schemes. But the villain, Dr. Hu, discovers that the real Kong would work even better.Now add some gorilla mind control, suitmation, miniature sets, and titanic battles between giants and you get an unforgettable epic (even if you want to forget it). The result is a film that fits somewhere between the original and a Godzilla film. Visually speaking the film is pure Godzilla-style and a credit to the Kaiju films of its day. While not as polished as some modern Kaiju films no Kaiju library should be without one. The dubbed dialogue actually adds to some of the fun as the villain gloats and compares the two Kongs. Check it out."
3,A passionate book .....but....,"The passion of the author flows out from every page, and every christian who wants something more for the Body of Christ will get stirred up. I agree with the Third day principal (you know..a 1000 years is a day, and a day is a 1000 years) but I have a small negative about this book. It is that I get uncomfortable when people set dates when God will do something, i.e on the 1st Jan 2001 the Third day begins. Does this mean that God operates from a man-made calander in heaven?. I don't want to sound negative, but date setting has often caused some red faces in the past. I DO believe that the 3rd day will usher in a great revival for the Body of Christ, but if it doesn't happen right here,right now, I'm not going to get upset with God and say you should've started it on the 1st Jan 2001!!"
5,Moonbears Skyfire,In this book Bear looks out his window and sees a rainbow. Bear has never seen a rainbow before and he thought that the sky was on fire. His friend Little Bird came by and told Bear that it was a rainbow and that there was a pot of gold! Well Bear thinks that the sky is still on fire. Bear and Little Bird go off and try to find the end of the rainbow.This book basically teaches the lesson that everyone has an imagination and its up to you the way u want to use it. The age level for this book is 3-8.I would recommend this book to very little kids because it is a short story and it tells kids basically what a rainbow really is.
4,good song,"This is a really good song, but I have no idea what everyone is talking about when they are calling it techno, it was definatly not techno. It is good, but not worth the current price, and there aren't any samples on this site. It might catch on just like Mambo No. 5 did, I remember being the only one who had ever heard it for like 3 weeks before it ever went on the radio."
5,Love the Capriol,"A wonderful recording of Warlock's Capriol Suite, which is my favorite Warlock composition. Having listened to several other recordings of this piece, I find this to be the best. There is also a wonderful Youtube video of a Chinese string orchestra playing the Capriol. In total, a very pleasing CD."
2,Pretty good ....but,"It has some nice features if you like to work from code. However, it falls out of activation at the slightest hardware change and there is a bug in the software that makes it extremely hard to re-activate. If you call Microsoft they will charge you $150 to help you re-activate this $100 software. I finally gave up and bought something else."
4,Works Just Fine,This is a bit smaller than the one I used during physical therapy but it works just fine for the exercises to regain my balance. I do wish there was some kind of instructions that had come with it. Instruction for when and if it needs to have air added to it and some ideas for exercises to do on it.
1,Disappointed in size of brand name- compared to PT's Dyna Disc.,"I was using a Dyna Disc Balance Cusion in physical therapy.I paid more to purchase the brand name product, and was disappointed in the size.It is about an inch smaller in diameter than the Dyna Disc at Physical Therapy, and much less comfortable to sit on and use because of the smaller size."
2,1st Bad Amazon Purchase,"I made a significant effort to get this instead of a cheaper look-alike. I bought two. One was a factory reject. The air valve is a disintegrating blob of white rubber or vinyl or whatever. Air can go in but cannot exit. Every attempt to adjust amount of inflation results in liquid rubber in the inflation pin making it useless. It seems only a matter of time before it can no longer keep air in the cushion and becomes a total waste of money. They is is the first and only disappointing Amazon purchase. And because we are continually traveling, a return or a claim is unviable. So we are quite screwed on this purchase. The OTHER Dyna Disc works fine but 1 out of 2 is unsatisfactory. Future Amazon purchases will certainly be affected by this bad deal."
2,Bitter SUgar,This is my favorite Cuban movie and I ordered two of the same movie and I have only received one to this date...
5,Great Movie!!!,This movie is excellent. It really shows the reality of the health system and the opression that Cuban People face now a days.GREAT FILM!!!
2,"Important, interesting, powerful, yet uninformed","I have nothing but admiration for Fidel Castro. I am Cuban who presently resides in the United States of my own accord. My employment opportunities were limited in Cuba, and Fidel Castro personally gave me permission to leave Cuba. I have been sending my mother and grandmother money for 10 years. Eventhough the situation is tense, it is the fault of the United States and its stupid embargo which makes our country so poor. Socialism is the best form of government, and Castro is a true revolutionary. Unfortunately, the U.S. has continued to deprive us of those things which we deserve. So what if we confiscated the property of American citizens. What business did they have owning lands in Cuba anyway? And for all those rich Cubans who are now stationed in Miami, what the hell is your problem? Did you all think that you could keep hoarding the wealth and lands forever? Socialism is the way of Cuba, get used to it."
3,Politically a bit simplistic; enjoy with a grain of salt,"1. This is a good (not great movie)2. To enjoy without bias, ignore the reviews (rhetoric) of ignorant Americans who have never been to Cuba and the ""reviews"" or better said - EXTREME bias of the ultra-rightist Cuban exiles who wish it was still 1958 when they prostituted themselves and the country to American corporations in exchange for being a national elite (while the MAJORITY of Cuban peasants starved most of the year)3. Who am I to say this? Someone knowledgable on film, born of Cuban parents - someone who has actually BEEN to and SEEN for MYSELF the situation in Cuba, and someone who did a master's thesis on Cuban development and studied/researched ALL views on the subject for 3 years.P>PS The Bushes and Reagans have been responsible for killing several thousand times more people than the big bad boogeyman Fidel. You all don't want democracy for Cuba, you want your beach houses and black servants back!"
1,Disingenuous of AMAZON,"I ordered this film in the expectation that the one or two glowing reviews that came up first in the Amazon reviews were accurate or dependable in some way. After having seen the film, I realize that this is another piece of propaganda from the exCuban fugitive community in Miami. Simplistic, unrealistic, inaccurate, and misinformed did not compensate for the ""torrid"" scenes of simulated intercourse. Cuba is a catastrophe, of that there is no doubt. The reasons however fall on all of us, the blockade, the abject fear of the spectre of socialism and social justice, and one of the unluckiest political struggles of modern times. I resent, however, that the customer reviews in Amazon.com can be so manipulated by a small group who would willingly starve their own relatives to fit their agenda."
2,Lack of depth,"This dominican telenovela, sorry, ""movie"", is unfortunately an heavy-weighted political manifesto which lacks of subtility ans psychology. Two parts are typical in this sense: the police scene with the young brother (associating ""freedom"" and ""listening to north american pop music"") and the final one, quite ridiculous for me, but certainly fantasmatic when the sun warms some white hairless heads near the playa Giron, sorry, Bay of Pigs monument in the Calle Ocho. A recent cuban movie, Life is to Whistle, was as critical as Bitter Sugar, but expressed its ideas in a more inspired and cultured way. The director seems to ignore that Cuba is not Sweden (or perhaps it's another fantasm), since all the characters, including our ""heroes"", are blancos como el coco."
1,"lot of noise, little substance","the movie was not copletely all-around bad, but i would not want to see it again. it is film that does not really show the realities of Cuba (though bitter they may be), but rather indulges he fantasies of the Miami Cubans. i myself have lived in Cuba, and i have seen the bad and the good. obvously, this was an atempt to show the bad side of socialist Cuba, and i don't see anything wrong with that; as long as it is done realistically. this film, however, repeatedly insults my intelligence; it is obvious that the filmmakers have not lived in cuba recently, and have not experienced the reality of the light yet dark, multifaceted nature of Cuban life. rather, they have merely entertained the mistaken ideology of the Cuban community in Miami."
1,At least the title is good,"Bitter Sugar is insultingly simplistic and implausible. I've been to Cuba several times and have many friends there, and I don't believe anyone is as out-to-lunch as our pathetic Marxist hero. He's surprised he's not welcome at the tourist bar? That his brother gets arrested for crashing the political march? I've found Cubans in Cuba to be smart and aware, with few illusions about what's good, bad, or mixed in their lives. Not like all our enthusiastic Miami reviewers, who love the message, not the movie. It is as complex as a Sunday school lesson, and I don't believe that good movies can be that simple."
4,Love in the time of Castro (Cholera),"One night in 1998 I was sitting alone on a weeknight and happened to switch to a movie on Cinemax. The first thing I noticed about the movie was the lilting Spanish and the second was the beautiful cinematography. To my surprise, I soon realized that this was a movie about Cubans. I am half Cuban and the little that I know about Cuba comes from my father and the limited contact I have had with my father's family. The title reflects the storyline and the acting to a T --- I have rarely seen such a bittersweet movie. I still do not know if I am biased towards this movie due only to my politics and my Cuban heritage but then again who doesn't bring some bias into watching a movie? I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in Cuba, keeping in mind that it is written and directed from a decidedly pro-American and therefore anti-Communist perspective."
2,dissapointed,"All I felt was dissapointment after watching this film. There were some interesting aspects and the portrayal of Cuban life helps any American think more closely about the embargo, however I can't help but feel that the film spread itself too thin. The issues and ideas were presented artlessly and it was not a pleasure to watch. Perhaps it was too much for this director to tackle in one film."
1,It became useless in less than a month.,"In about one month, during which I used it about 10 nights, it started losing air and became useless. Re-pumping didn't help. Also, since it was impossible to locate the leakage, there was little that could be done. A piece of junk."
3,Works fine.,Does what it is designed for. I wouldn't order with the extra edge agian but that is my own fault.
2,Don't throw away your old mattress...,"Well aside from not being very comfortable and feeling as though it may flip over on me if I get too close to the edge, it finally had to be sent back within 6 months. It must have broke loose inside because there was a huge air bubble that wouldn't deflate. I also had to add air every few days to keep it firm. It's an ok bed for a few nights, but I certainly wouldn't use it as a full time bed."
4,Good record.,"Good, but not great. Bought this after the recommendation from the That Metal Show guys. I think they hyped it a little more than it was worth. What's good is great - Hard As A Rock is fast becoming a fave of mine. What isn't good is subpar. But overall, a good hard rock record."
3,cute drum...HORRIBLE SMELL!,"I was so excited to have received this drum for my toddler. When I removed the drum from the box, I thought I was gonna pass out from the HORRIBLE SMELL! To rid the drum of this problem, I washed it out and sat it near an open window. The smell was better after the second day."
2,Kindle Psalms:The Book of Psalms,"The format was done in the old style English, with the ""Thee"" and ""Thous"" therefore I have used it very rarely. The reading/paraying of the Psalm does not flow easily for my tradition...Roman Catholic. I do not know what translation Amazon/Kindle was following."
4,Kindle psalms,"I would have liked the psalms in both English and Hebrew, possibly in both the Hebrew alphabet and in transliteration. While I can't use the kindle during services, I can use it while traveling."
4,Psalms in the real world,"Obviously if you're purchasing this set you are Christian and enjoy the book of Psalms. This set is very well done and the reading is excellent. It is in the King James Version but due to the psalms natural English poetic nature this (English) speaker reads and verbalizes it very well. The choir and organ music played between a psalm every so often is at first annoying but as you sink into the wonderful spoken word of psalms it adds a ""pause and consider"" peaceful air to the recording. I enjoy the interlude. If King james bothers you, you may or may not like it. If you can't stand King James you won't like this either. But as I said, due to the nature of Psalms and it's naturally poetic style, the King James fits very well. If you're a lover of Psalms you'll love this!"
2,Maybe okay for walking around town,"Because I'm an avid runner that can pretty much use any neutral shoe, thought I would run in this shoe with no problems. I found that the top stitching in the toe-box was weird and pressed up against my foot. Overall they were surprisingly uncomfortable. However, if you are looking for a shoe to just walk around in or do some light exercise, this one seems okay."
3,Not bad but needed to be a little longer,"This book is a compilation of scientific questions written in to the ""New Scientist"" magazine's ""Last Word"" page. Other readers then sent in their replies, the questions are of a non earth-shattering nature. ""Why do some people stick out there tounges while thinking"", ""Why are eggs egg-shaped"", ""Why doesn't cling wrap cling to a metal bowl as well as it does to plastic or glass bowls"", ""How can ants survive in a microwave"". These are some of the questions that are tackled. Although the book is not bad it is very short and will be completed in one sitting. The questions could have been more interesting, but I guess that's the fault of the readers of New Scientist. I would recommend that people read the great ""Why things are & why things aren't"" by Joel Achenbach, before this as that was a real gem."
3,Criminal Law Handbook,"I bought this product to find out more about a citizen's rights under the law.It is a good first start, but isn't as detailed about certain subjects as I would like. I feel like I could have obtained the information I was really interested in by going to the library than spending $26 for the book.Sally Humphries, Cincinnati, OH"
5,an easy 'guided tour' of the criminal justice system,"Watching reruns of Law & Order is no substitute for actual knowledge of the American law system. This guide is not done in a traditional textbook style, so this book is not the one to check out if you want a history lesson.I really appreciated the fact that it included a glossary section, explaining anything from easy stuff like ""alibi"" to more complex terms like ""anticipatory search warrant"" and ""prejudicial error"".This guide often gives fictitious ""case examples"", where the author explains any questions that a person might have. They are written with some humor, such as when the author mentions fictitious people with names like ""Della Ware"" or ""Rob Banks"".The language is pretty clear/easy, which can be especially helpful if someone with limited English skills uses the book. Overall, it's a pretty good introduction to the American criminal justice system. Like the back cover of the NOLO guide says, it really is an accessible 'guided tour'."
5,Give this book to everyone you know!,"I wish that our family had read this book years ago. If you are innocent, you really need this book, because once the police see you as guilty, your life will disappear into a black hole. You will never even see it coming. Protect yourself and your family."
5,Awsome..,"I just wanted to say that this book is great, awsome.I had checked it out several times at my local library, then I decided to buy it due to all the wonderfull and helpfull information. It goes beyond technical description, breaks it down to be eaisly digestable. Thank you for a wonderfull book,I would highly recommend this book to family or friends.Not only for law students, anyone who is interested in how the system works.Thank you. Sincerly, Tina"
2,"Too Brief, and Advice Seems Impractical","Note: My primary interest in this book was in the material on encounters with police officers on the street.I found some light was shed on important aspects of the law regarding individual's rights and obligations under American law when dealing with the authorities. However, I was concerned that the information imparted was incomplete and that the advice given was possibly not practical."
3,Good stand,"This is a sturdy well made stand. My complaint and the reason why I only give it 3 stars is the design of the hand grips. It looked like a nice style in the picture but it is actually very limiting. You can't do pull ups with your hands close together, only very far apart or hammer style. This would be perfect if it just had a straight bar going across. Or better yet the option to switch a bar out for the hand grips so you have the best of both worlds."
3,Phoenix 99403 Power Stand II,"This product was made in China and the manufacturing left something to be desired. There were some misaligned holes for the bolts that I had to drill out, which made the assembly a little difficult, and I ended up with 2 short bolts that couldn't be used anywhere and missing two longer bolts that I had to buy at the hardware store to finish the assembly. The assembled product is okay and for the price quite adequate. Definitely not the quality you would find in a decent gym but no where near as pricy either. I think the Power Stand will work fine for what I need but if the holes would have been a bit farther off it might have been very difficult to get put together."
3,"Okay gym, but needs to be forcefully put together.","This gym is decent once it is put together. Since it is yet another product made in China, it is not really Quality Controlled. I had to use a large hammer to fit one of the top pull-up bars into place. Some of the bolts have damaged threads. The pads used to hold you in place while doing the leg and ab workouts get really slippery when wet, so you have to use towels over them. If your chest is wide like mine, then you will most likely feel cramped in the device.Overall though it is not a bad gym. For the price (Under $150), and if you get free shipping, it is well worth the money. Just expect to use your own tools and a hammer when putting it together."
4,"Dude, you will love this","This thing was bigger than I thought. Im 6'1 and it is perfect, there is enough clearance for my legs too. Before assembly, you have to determine which screws are A, B, and so on. You do this by measuring the screw (using millimeters). The only mistake I made was putting the grips on the handle BEFORE installing the handle. It is HELL to take off if you made that mistake. I made it twice, ha. The handle moves up for ab excercises, and down for dips. The grips aren't very comfortable though. My hand is one huge callus. There are 2 screws that came up short, (I had to buy longer replacements.) Overall, I would give this product 4.5 start. You will not regret it. It is very sturdy. Even my dad comes in the room once in a while to stretch on this station. And he weights 190 pounds."
4,Good Product,"This product works as intended. I thought that the assembly was easy enough with all required nuts and bolts. It is made from lightweight tubing which appears to be very strong. Because it is lightweight it moves a little during use but still remains stable. Considering the cost and construction,I think this equipment is a good choice for any home gym."
4,"Good, but not great","I recieved the Phoenix within days of ordering. It was relatively easy to put together (and I am not a handy person), although two of the screws were short so I went to home depot and bought them there. It fits in the corner of my bedroom in my small apartment and does not take up a lot of room. It is pretty sturdy, and doesn't shake that much when I use it.Overally I give it a 4.5 stars. For the cost, and amount of space it takes up it is a good deal. If you are looking for something super high quality/sturdy I would pick something else instead."
3,Good machine but the construction not solid,"I bought this machine a month ago. The delivery was very good as it arrived in a timely manner. The machine just about does the job but the construction is not as solid. If i had to buy another product, it definately would not be this one. 'You buy cheap, you buy twice'"
3,Instructions are wrong,"This thing is pretty hard to assemble. First of all the bolts that are supposed to be in 5mm increments just seem to be the same bolts cut with a chop saw so it's hard to tell which size some are supposed to be, being that they are +/- about 6mm on those 5mm increments. Secondly the instructions tell you to put the handles in before putting the uprights onto the stand. The instructions show you a very clear picture of putting the handles on backwards. Assuming the instructions were correct, I did this. Now I have to figure out how to get them off without ripping the grips.The stand also wobbles if you do pullups fast, and the bar with the pad at the bottom serves no discernible purpose except to put your feet on when you drop down. It then rolls and makes you fall.Otherwise it's cheap and does what it should, just make sure you ignore the instructions for handle orientation."
3,Design is flawed at the base,"The design is flawed at the base. It should spread out to provide more stability. Overall, it's not bad especially for the price. The material seems strong enough. The instructions though are lacking and it shakes if you do pull-up fast."
3,Phoenix PS403 Power Stand II,It has all the necessities but kind of wobbly. Needs some sort of weight to hold it steady. A couple bags of cement will probably do the trick.
4,Great for the price,"This was a fairly easy machine to set up. It took me about 15 min or so. This is very sterdy and the color looks good with the rest of my workout gym equipment. One thing i did not like is the shipping box had a bunch of holes, I was very lucky no material was lost. Otherwise very good. have had for 2 weeks now."
2,Rusted!!!,Product instructions were outdated and didn't make sense. Some of the parts were rusted and paint was blistering. The main supports wobble no matter how much I tighten the bolts...bottom line is you get what u pay for....i am very disappointed...and i shop on amazon almost everyday. spend the money and buy something else.
3,"Not very good for different types of pull ups, chin ups.",Good for leg raises for ab work but that's about it. You can only really do one method of push ups and the overhead bars limit your chin up variety. It's a bit wobbly when doing chin ups as well. It does make a very handy clothes rack now that I've moved on to P90X.
4,Nice piece of equipment,"This is a nice piece of equipment. It is sturdy, compact, and doesn't moan or squeak. I am all of 210lbs and this thing holds me fine. When putting it together I thought it might be too compact, but that is not an issue. Also when putting it together I thought the dip handles were going to be unsafe, but they are solid and sturdy as well. I have this thing in my heated garage and it takes up a very small area.I didn't have any of the assembly issues the others had. No pounding or wrangling for me when I put mine together. Seemed easy to me....I only have a few gripes; put some longer extra bolts in the package, and it would be nice to have grips on the entire wide grip bar.Bottom Line: You'll get the workout you are looking for and at a great price. (without sacrificing quality)"
4,Phoenix 99403 very suitable for small room,"This model save alot of space in your room. I am impress about the design. As we all know now aday, everything is compact and space is limited; therefore, the Phoenix 99403 Power Stand II is the best among many others dip bar availabe on the market. The only one thing need to improve is the welding process. The manufacturing need to do a better job on the join area between pieces. Other than that, It is a perfect piece of exercise machine."
4,Wartime Correspondence Between President Roosevelt & Pope Pius XII,"In contrast to all the junk out there attempting to pass itself off as history, this book solidly lays out what evils challenged civilization in the early 20th century and the bold stances of both the USA and the Vatican."
2,Murky pond,I thought this bacteria was working well until my pond turned green/brown. It is completely opaque and I can not clear it using this product. I may try a different type of bacteria to see if it improves.
2,Delta Faucet,Everything was as expected except center part of faucet leaked which forced me to reuse old parts with new washers.
2,"Just O.K., a little SCHMALTZY","I have almost finished this book, and I have to say I am disappointed, as I read rave reviews about it and was expecting something more dynamic. While this book DOES have some time honored good, common sense principles, they are nothing new and at times (many times) the book is downright ""schmaltzy"", like being at a Girl Scout rally or Mary Kay meeting. WIth sayings like: ""Believe in yourself"", ""Love yourself"", WOW, that's a revelation! It's not that it's a terrible book, but just be prepared for the Pollyanna pep talks which we've heard a ZILLION times before. Knowing what I know now, I would probably not buy this book, but if I saw it in the library I might take it out."
5,"If it were a dog, It would've bit me...","I had a hard time placing this easy read down. Susie has opened my eyes, and restored my ""Passion"" for the industry. The ideas, and strategies were so eye opening, I wanted jump in the car and head to the salon, and start mapping my future. For the first time, I feel doctors pay is with in my grasp. Thank-you Susie"
1,Do not recommend.,Does not trap heat. Still feel cold after wearing in winter weather. Do not recommend for winter weather. Feel a bit itchy.
5,The cure for cold feet.,"I bought these through Amazon a couple of months ago because I sometimes have cold feet when sitting for a while at home, and right away I liked the sox a lot. But I've been using them as boot sox for hiking as well, and my conclusion is, they're fantastic! I needed to let out the laces on the boots a little because they're so thick, but that just adds a little more cushion for my feet. There is very little if any stretch to them. I use them with sock liners in the boots. For lounging at home or winter hiking, they're the best sox I've ever owned! When the weather warms up I'll go back to a lighter weight pair (Smart Socks) but these will come out again next fall at the first hint of cold temperatures."
3,Order incorrect,"I only order 1 pair of socks. They are expensive. Socks are ok, I guess. A gift for someone. I don't like having to pay for what I did not order, but it's not worth the postage to return."
5,Best Wool Socks I've Ever Worn!,"I hike and hunt a lot in Texas and Michigan. Both states get very cold...wet...windy and miserable. I've worn poor quality wool sox, medium quality, 3 pairs at a time, etc. Let me tell you, if you want warm, comfortable TERRIFIC wool sox, order these!! I hunt deer and wild boar a lot in Texas where it gets muddy, wet, cold and windy. My feet have felt frozen at times sitting in a deer or hog stand with rain and/or snow coming down. I got sick of my feet getting cold, which makes you fidgety and every minute seems like an hour. I ordered 2 pair of these J.B. Icelandic Arctic Trail - 40 Below Winter Socks and let me tell you they are OUTSTANDING!!! Cushiony, warm, just the right lenght. I have zero complaints. Nothing but praise for the quality and feel of these socks. The wonderful cushion these provide while hiking is a breath of fresh air as well. Just can not praise this product enough. Do yourself a favor and boy some. The price is right too!"
5,Great Extreme Cold Weather Socks!,"I bought these socks to wear with my Steger Mukluks. I sized my luks a full size larger to accommodate heavy socks of these sorts. With that in mind, I could not be happier!"
4,warm!!!!!/ fast shipper.,"like any other sock, your feet sweat,sock gets wet, feet get cold ! i work out side 10 hours a day, and if your not moving, like me, your feet will get cold. i change to the second pair after 6 houres, this helps a lot, buy more than 2 pair."
4,Really warm.,Theses are really warm at 20 or 30 degrees but I sure wouldn't want to rely on them at 40 bellow.
5,I get the extra large and then felt them,"These are a tiny bit itchy but they are nice and thick and so I get the 13 and larger size and ""felt"" them by putting them in hot, hot water in a top loading washer with lots of ajutation and they shrink and get thicker and are even warmwer. I love these socks, especially when felted."
1,too thick and rough,super rough fabric and way too thick. you would not be able to wear same shoes with these socks on
5,GREAT SOCKS!!,GREAT SOCKS!!Super warm and comfortable socks.Keep my feet warm during sleep.I would recommend these socks to my best friend.
4,Covers a lot.,"Discusses financial applications of neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic. Is aimed at the beginner to intermediate level. Focuses more on data processing and application than on the actual building of neural nets. Several useful examples are given. Sections are written by experts in that particular field. This is usually advantageous except ocassionally where terminology may not always be consistent between sections. Overall a good book if you know how to write your own NN/GA/FUZZY program or have access to one."
2,Waste if money,"What good is this book withut tradestation code. Eventually you will not use it and will set on your book shelf collecting dust. I suspect the author knows how to program and all other author like him. Topics studied in MS computer science software courses leave it to programers to write, since they are qualified than those who don't know how, But can do research ans sell a book to excited hope to be traders."
5,Fabulous and gripping to kids,"I selected this book to read to kindergarteners as I was asked to come as a community reader at the local grade school. I wanted something that I could make ""come to life"" for these kids. It was suggested to me and I tested it out on my own 2 and 4 year old. They LOVED it! And so did the kids at the kindergarten. I made a different voice for each animal basing each voice on what we teach kids that animals say -- my duck is somewhat obnoxious as a duck's quack can be, etc. This book lends itself to plenty of action and if read right, it will captivate children!"
5,Entertaining for Reader as well !,A very cute story. Excellent illustrations. This is a must for any childs library. The story is written with much flair in all the animals in this humorous little book.
5,Love this Series,If you loved Kate & Allie then you will love watching these old shows again. I love revisiting all the old 80's hairstyles and clothes! It is hard to believe this show is about 25 years old! This Cd set I bought had both the 1st and 2nd season and although I think a little pricey I have enjoyed it.
3,disappointed,disappointed in the package that holds the 2 dvds it totally fell apart when i opened it up.i like to keep the dvds with the holders but oh well will have to come up with something else.
4,Works Fine and is Sturdy,I bought this on Amazon almost a year ago and have used it on at least 15-20 occasions. It works just fine; has held up well; and is easy to clean after use. It is a nice looking kitchen gadget that is sturdily built. I expect it will stay in my service for some time.
5,The Hunted,"This is my first Elmore Leonard book, and I loved it, loved his characterization and dialogue. The book was intense, but at the same time didn't seem to take itself too seriously. And as a female reader who loves the late 20th/early 21st century romance genre, I have to say that Davis--the hunky marine--was quite the treat."
3,Enjoyable story of mid-budget movie level,This book is pretty entertaining. The story is interesting but not super. Leonard's strength seems to be in his character development and crisp dialogue. There's not much to write about this book that is deep and insightful. If the story sounds interesting and you like Leonard you won't be disappointed.
2,Not a good book,"Not a good book, but just a few ideas for a good one. The changes in the behaviour of the main character Rosen are baffling and go without further explanation. There's not much plot and most of it doesn't make much sense (in some situations, you just can't figure out why the characters act the way they do - mostly it seems to make a thin book a bit more substantial). The end isn't particularly satisfying, too. Just the dialogue saves the day - and the second star. Even though the book's from 1977, this is my second straight disappointment after Be Cool"
3,Leonard in an unusual setting,"This book was first published in the 70's (?) and is set in Israel with references, only, to Leonard's usual turf - the criminal world in the USA.His hero, Rosen, who has done the dirty to a mobster hides out in israel where he believes he will not be found. A freak incident leads to his photograph outside a hotel in Israel being published in an American newspaper and his whereabouts being discovered.In the ensuing story, which no Leonard fan will want to miss, Rosen is pursued and the story makes for exciting reading, BUT it is not vintage Leaonard mainly, I think, because it is not set in the USA. It lacks some of the usual black humour one finds throughout Leonard's ouevre and somehow, it is less moral than Leonard's books usually are.But get it to complete your Leonard collection - he is still the best crime writer writing !"
1,Bad car-charger. Alternative shown here.,"The car-charger stinks! It is not the supplier, it is the manufacturer. One of them lasted me only days. Finally, I found a good car-charger at office Max, brand name ""Just Wireless"" at about $20."
5,Precious!,"This picture-book about how the mockingbird became the official State Bird of Texas is an original and well told tale. Although the story is fiction, there are lots of educational facts about The Lone Star State; its geography, its birds and its uniqueness! Our students truly enjoyed this story of how Molly Mockingbird finds her own true voice and song just in time for the talent competition of the Texas State Bird Pageant ... other favorite characters included Gabby Green Jay, Owlma Owl, Bonita Blackbird, Carley Cardinal, Guadeloupe Gull & Dovie Crockett! Learn about Texas birds in a fun way and don't miss this exceptional addition to really good Texas Children's Books ... apparently the author and illustrator are also working on other State Bird Books, these will be wonderful to collect, especially if you are an Elementary School Librarian like I am!"
3,VERY BAD DESCRIPTION,the product says 8hrs recording but this thing only records 6hrs they need to change this description.
4,Billy Jo at her best.,Billy Jo Spears has released many wonderful albums and this one is up with the rest. A truly wonderful country sound.
5,Dad,"I purchased this for my Father, it brought back tons of memories from him and for that I am grateful! He just loves it!"
2,Reaching squishy squeaks,"Not without a few genuinely intense moments of screaming texture, this experimental free jazz still comes across as bracingly obtuse in an apathetic way."
4,Burke's Law is sensual,"Well paced, plenty of excellent early day actors; love the Roll's Royce and theme song and mysteries are hard to figure the ""bad guy."""
4,If you like truffles...,"This book has excellent, easy to follow recipes. I made 5 batches of different truffles for Valentine's Day gifts, and they were very well received. If you have not worked with chocolate before, I recommend also purchasing 'The Art of Chocolate' by Elaine Gonzalez. The techniques of chocolate handling are explained in detail. When these techniques are combined with Ms. Bloom's recipes, it was a fun and easy endeavor."
4,"Truffles, Candies, & Confections: Elegant Candymaking in the Home",This book made a great Christmas gift for my daughter. Thanks
5,Don't let the recording quality fool you,"I have to agree with Joe's review above: the later tracks on this CD were not recorded in a studio somewhere. That's just how early blues recordings sound, folks. This is an excellent collection and a slice of history."
2,Further to...,"This is clearly a forgotten corner of the Amazon.com catalogue; in the last year nobody has enlightened us on this subject. I may be in a position to do so myself, and with some apologies for my earlier disparaging comments. Based on the track listing of a CD featuring Sonny Terry, with Woodie Guthrie and Cisco Houston, and based on an imaginative assumption of Houston's singing under presumably extremely primitive conditions, it seems that he may be the singer I maligned. Sincere apologies, then, but still no upgrade on the rating on account of the minimal sleeve notes, non-existent performer credits/recording details, and truly excrable sound. [The CD reviewed has the same title and track listing, but different cover. Legacy International CD 368]"
2,... and who else?,"First of all, I quite agree with ""James"". The tracks featuring Sonny and Brownie (I can't tell if the balance of the disc even involves them) are as lovely as you would expect, and quite decently reproduced. The remaining tracks are dreadfully recorded and poorly selected (the over-riding criterion seeming to be reference to chain gangs). Listening sequentially leads one to incredulous laughter shortly followed by anger and boredom. That said, I would be very interested to know who the mystery voice is (not that he can sing), and the provenance of the recorded songs - genuine country blues, if a little monothematic. And so we come to the final gripe with this CD - the sleevenotes are worthless in the extreme. Is this really a Smithsonian recording??? If so, please let's have some more info."
5,SPECIAL,I ordered this pendent for my boyfriend because his fav color is blue and I am the star and he is the moon.
5,Songs include:,Give 'em RhythmUnguarded MomentsVictims of GoodbyeIsn't It Always LoveLove Over Old TimesI Just Don't Have the HeartOne Foot on the StreetOn the Other Side of MidnightSurpriseIt's Still There
1,Not excited,"In search of a better understanding of the essence of Native American cremonial music, I found myself quite dissapointed on hearing this CD. Reading each song title as I went. I discovered the same two songs repeating over and over, as the titles changed. This CD does a disservice to Native American culture by not properly crediting the tribal origin of each song."
1,"The ""S"" word...","Not only this includes public SI releases for Native American social and ceremonial dances as any other recording (in the EXACT order), but it renames them in a wicked fashion!!!!!Other than that, few track simply repeat!Definitely worth sparing your money for something different!PS.: I would rate 0 stars, but this thing won't let me"
5,The best book for oil painters,"This is simply the best most practical instruction for oil painters. I loved it from the start when he said that when it comes to talent, don't worry if you have it or not. Proceed as if you do."
5,Outstanding,"I own many, many books on painting and painting techniques etc. This is the definitive book on how to approach and, especially, evaluate your work. I would find it hard to imagine anyone with a true love of painting who will not benefit from Schmid's encouragement and love of his life's work. I refer to it often for tips, reminders and inspiration. Could not recommend it enough."
5,Very informative.,Even though Richard Schmid's writing style is easy to read there is so much information packed into this book that it is a slow read. It is also one that I will come back to time and again. The reproductions of his paintings are wonderful. I would highly recommend this book to any serious painter.
3,"Great Artist, Not a Great Writer","Let's be real. Richard Schmid is a tremendous painter. He's one of my favorite contemporary painters, in fact. He, however, is NOT a tremendous writer. When I read ""Everything I Know about Painting"" I expect just that. I was hoping for a lot of meat and potatoes and a lot less table ornamentation. Schmid's writing style was very similar to that in Carlson's Guide to Landscape Painting book. If you find that book hard to read, you will also find this book hard to read. Like Carlson's book, there are some great nuggets of information here, but the author leaves separating the wheat from the chaff to the reader. The book can be purchased directly from Richard Schmid's web site for a WHOLE lot less than here."
5,Alla Prima Book,This book is so helpful for even experienced artists. He gives us many ideas we haven't thought of or at least not in a long time. It is a great book to review every once & a while.
2,Don't purchase direct; go to Utrecht,"I don't own this book, but I have studied a borrowed copy. For me it's just a coffee table book about one man's vision, but not a working tutorial. The 2 star rating is my opinion of what you get for $95.If you must have it, at least look at a copy first. Then I would suggest you check out Utrecht Art Supplies who carries both editions at $95/$50 and discounts them occasionally when they have one of their sales. This weekend (Memorial Day) it's 40% off (Yes, $57 for the hardcopy) plus free shipping if you order a couple of extra items to bring the total up to $75 including the book. They do collect sales tax if you live in a state where they have brick and mortar stores, but, let's not quibble. If you missed the Memorial Day sale check back every so often as they have different offers at different times. BTW, I have no interest in Utrecht other than being a long time customer."
1,Never received,"I would like to read the book. After two months, the projected delivery date is still two months away. Please cancel this order. There was no place to cancel the order on the order page only a checkmark to accept shipment delay. By the way, I still think Bezos' picture on the cover of Time two years ago was the goofiest ceo I've ever seen."
2,"Uninteresting, unlikable characters","I picked up this book free during an Amazon giveaway. A small group of women who meet for prayer and gossip are invaded by a self-important Texan transplant.This book put me off almost immediately. The women in the club are wimps except for the invading Texan, who is creepy as well as obnoxious. Shepherd switches POV frequently, as chapters are ""narrated"" by different club members with ""interludes"" between chapters of the activities of a reporter who wants to expose the group. It was so awful I couldn't even make it 10% of the way through the book. All I can award a star for is that the spelling/grammar/formatting was okay."
3,Like it but too Christian for me.,I've read Christian fiction before but never one so strong on the religion. I started skipping the passages that was quoting Scripture.Still I enjoyed the characters and the overall story. However its unlikely I will read another one in the series.
2,No excuses,"While this is an entertaining little tale, there is no excuse for the sloppiness of the manuscript. It is rife with spelling and other errors that should not be in it."
4,A Taste of Real Life Spiced with Infinite Grace,"In The Potluck Club, Linda Evans Shepherd and Eva Marie Everson have created a recipe for entertainment mixed with truth and seasoned with love. Read this book and discover that, no matter what we face in life, God's saving grace is sufficient.[...]www.CelebrationCoaching.com"
5,Smash hit,These authors' characters will capture your heart. I am anxious for the sequel! I hated for the book to end. Excellent read.
2,At least the format was cute...,"The recipe cards made for clever chapter dividers, with all the recipes printed in the back. Nevertheless, I didn't care much for this book because I found the characters superficial and unlikeable. What a judgmental bunch! However, I guess this is rather true to form as some of the religious people I've known have behaved similarly. The back cover doesn't give away the overt religious tone of the book. If you're not looking for a pious Christian setting, don't bother."
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed this book at the beginning, but it became very ""preachy"". Wish I had been warned that it was a strongly opinionated evangelical christian tale. Delia"
5,The Potluck Club,"What kind of review do you want-a review of the book or a review of your service?The price was excellent. The book was sent out the next day. However, it took two weeks to be delivered. I expected it sooner than that. I will definitely purchase from Amazon again."
3,Female Book,"I enjoyed reading this book enough to buy the next book, which I'm reading now. I'll probably read the rest of the series, just to see what these busy body ladies do next. I think this is probably not a book that many men would enjoy, and it's not gripping or suspenseful, but it is kind of fun to read. If you like soap operas, you might like this because it's kind of like a soap book."
2,Potluck Club,Not a great book and tons of typos. It is an easy read and good to pass the time on my morning commute
3,"Slow starter, but good book overall","I had a little trouble getting into this book but it really ended up being a nice read. The characters are not all that lovable, and some of the plot is a little far-fetched, but overall not too bad. I wouldn't give a gushing recommendation, but more like a ""Give it a try- you might like it""."
3,Too many people,"This book just had too much going on. There are 6 different women you have to follow and it is hard to remember who is who and who did what. There of course is some good ""drama"" which kept me reading but I don't think I will be reading the next book. I don't like when I have to work to read a book."
2,Very Slow,I just couldn't get into this book. It really didn't have a plot. It was just about a bunch of supposedly Christian women who didn't like each other getting together to gossip. I couldn't even finish it.
4,A surprisingly wonderful read,"Thought I would give this book a try, but didn't expect much. Found myself trying to steal time to get back and read more. Insightful, Christian interpretations. Can touch your life with the women and situations that have probably happened in your life.The Potluck Club (The Potluck Club, Book 1)Can't wait to read the next one!The Potluck Club: Trouble's Brewing (The Potluck Club, Book 2)"
5,A great book to share with your friends!,"I loved this book! It's the best of Christian Women's fiction. I loved the relationships between a group of women, who love and pray for each other through the trials & joys of life. I also liked how the characters grow and mature and learn to give each other grace. The recipes are good too!"
3,The Year of Thrash,"Given its 1991 release date, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Metal Massacre XI was loaded with thrash bands. Thrash was the style at the time, and new thrash bands were popping out of the woodwork. Of the 14 bands featured on this CD, 11 of them - Mystic Force, Epidemic, Forte, My Victim, Havoc Mass, Ministers of Anger, Dominance, Mortal Reign, Harum Scarum (not to be confused with AOR band Harem Scarem), Chemikill, and Tynator - played thrash-influenced if not straight thrash metal. Divine Right and Nightcrawler were both Warlord-style power metal bands, and the Spudmonsters...who knows what that was all about? They obviously listened to a lot of SOD and DRI.Unfortunately none of the bands featured on Metal Massacre XI went on to achieve any real success. Still, the disc serves as a nice reminder of 1991's metal landscape."
2,Not happy with freight costs,"We purchased 2 pairs of Brooks runners at the same time as CosaminNutramax CosaminDS Exclusive Formula - 230 capsulesDS. Our freight charge was only $17 for the shoes, but we were hit with a freight cost of $46.00 for the Cosamine tablets. I sent an email via the company feedback form and never received a reply. It cost us more to purchase with the freight costs, than if we purchased the product in Australia."
5,Love It!,Bought this a month ago- took a few weeks to get from amazon (told it was back-ordered a few days after I ordered). Anyway- worth the wate. Love it! Plenty big for 3-4 sandwiches (adult size). Also love that it has adjustable temp setting. Amazing how much more enjoyable a hot sandwich is than a cold one- especially in these winter months.
5,This thing is great.,"If you want to eat panini all the time, get this. We cannot seem to stop eating panini. This is a wonderful product. It heats our panini evenly, and there seems to be no end to how creative you can get with panini. The price was very low for such a wonderful addition to our collection of kitchen gadgets. You can spend a lot more, but why. This could not be outdone. I bought this under protest from my wife, but she loves it."
4,Given as a gift,I bought this as Christmas gifts. Both persons I gave it to loved the item. They use it for everything from the intended use to cooking shrimp on skewers to grilling veggies. Size is great for a family of 4.
1,Worked for a while,We have been using the panini maker every day. It heats up very well and leaves no cold spots. I am very happy with my purchase.Update: Panini maker died 3 weeks later. Haier offered to replace but I just threw it out and bought a Cuisinart which I truly love!
2,not worth it,"I received this as a gift and found it unimpressive and cheaply made. I can get the same results by grilling over a stove-top and placing a second pan on the sandwich to weigh it down. Easier clean up that way, too. We returned immediately."
4,"lots of evolution, but still `ancient rites'","with the new album `dim carcosa', ancient rites continues the trend they set with `fatherland'. although this album contains even more melodic parts than predecessor fatherland, they have not forgotten their roots, BLACK METAL! ancient rites remains ancient rites, which you can most of all see in the lyrics, about european and flemish history. fylosofical or mystical, they are always worth a careful listen. musically, the album is GREATLY composed, and the orchestral arrangements are very good as well. technically, it is again a big step forward, as well for gunthers' vocals as for erik's and jan's earth-shaking guitars and walters' lightning-fast drums. however, fatherland gets all 5 ***** and this album `only' ****, because it misses some `darkness', in which fatherland standed out as a true masterpiece! but i think dim carcosa will become a classic as well."
2,Just couldn't do it...,"I bought this CD after I heard a few of their songs on an internet radio broadcast. My computer speakers aren't the greatest, so I somehow missed the electronic drums that are used. Boy did that throw me for a loop when I slapped this CD on. WTF?!?! Electronic drums in Black/Viking metal?!?! Completely ruins this album. I really tried to like it too, 'cause it'd be a darn good CD (hence the 2 stars instead of completely demoting it to 1) if not for the stupid electronic drums. I just couldn't get past the fake tic-tic-tic sound. I don't know if the rest of their stuff is like that, but jesus guys, this doesn't work out, get a real drumset."
1,The best parts of this film are stolen from other films,"I was shocked to purchase this film and to find that it is an almost direct ripoff of Rick Ray's excellent ""The Soul Of India"". It appears the filmmakers have simply copied Ray's program, removed the intelligent narration, and inserting their own shrill British narrator. The end result is a mishmash and probably a serious copyright violation. If you want a much more in depth film about the subject, go to the source film for this cheaply made mashup."
2,Hinduism- A way of life,The work here is very superficial.The project could have been dealt more in depth.
2,Interesting in theory... but not interesting while reading.,"The cover of this book says ""He summoned the monsters of the past to help him rule the world."" I guess it's my own fault that I didn't really like the book because I judged it based on that. I thought it would be a sci-fi thriller with a horror based plot. It's not. It's more of a futuristic social commentary. Which would be fine... except that it's not interesting to read. All the elements are exactly the same: the characters all talk in the same grandiose vocabulary, the computers talk this same way, and the events are all described in the same way too. Because of this, everybody & everything in the book lacks personality. However, it's interesting to reflect on after reading it."
1,Black supremacist propaganda & just bad writing,"This author is clearly a supporter of black supremacy/separtism, and his so-called ""research"" is nothing more than ramblings, opinions, faults he presents as facts, unreliable & biased sources, and a total misunderstanding of Scriptures. In all, a true Christian, jew or muslim should stay away from this false teacher."
2,Nothing Happening,This is a show that purports to be about people that do unusual things to avoid spending money. There are no useful tips as the people usually do something gross to save pennies such as not using toilet paper or dumpster diving.It also seems pretty staged. There is a scene where a man serves his wife goat heads for dinner because they are cheap - but the show itself shows him buying them for seven dollars. You can get a less gross cut of meat for seven dollars. These people also had a beautiful home.The one idea I liked was the idea of taking a spending fast for a week - not spending any money for a period and using the supplies and food you already have on hand. But I will not be trying this now around holiday time.
3,Nostalgic memoir.,"Since I grew up in Rochester, this book had a lot of meaning for me. I knew many of the people mentioned, and it was interesting to read the history of the Mayo Clinic. There was too much detail about the process of going through it, but overall I enjoyed the book."
3,Good for small jobs if you have patience,"This sprayer will do the job if you are willing to thin the paint enough and endure wasted paint in the process. It will *not* spray house paint straight from the can, nor will it spray most interior paints without thinning. This makes the sprayer sometimes not worth using when one considers the alternative of just breaking out a paint brush and doing the job the old fashioned way as opposed to struggling with the thinning of the paint, the wasted paint, and the clean-up of the sprayer afterwards."
1,"boring, instructor is not good, she's dull as is the video","Shiva was bad in her prenatal video and i think even worse in this video, she is boring, not uplifting and very plain. I do not like this yoga at all, other yoga is so much better, she is not a good video instructor at all."
4,Works great,Does exactly what I want it to do to my hair with very little product. I may be doing something to my hormones too with the parabens in the ingredients. I highly recommend if you want to be part of the science experiment with me.
3,kids love it... but the clock broke after 2 days!,"My girls love Winne the Pooh and this book; however, the arm of the clock broke off after only a couple of days!! I tried to repair it with some krazy glue but it didn't work. So now we have to use a separate clock alongside the book or just point with fingers. Too bad it wasn't more durable."
4,Ben Goes to War,"The sixth volume of ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" has our hero Ben Tennyson in four new-to-DVD episodes including the epic two-part special ""War of the Worlds"" (how cliche). In it, he and all the other heroes he can gather get ready for the ultimate Highbreed invasion. But suddenly the Omnitrix Master Control has put into reset making things even more complicated.Along with these episodes is another Alien Database showing more spacey specs of more aliens and heroes.Look for the seventh volume coming soon plus an all-new series ""Ben 10 Ultimate Alien"" on Cartoon Network."
4,Ben 10 a huge hit with my nephew,"Ordered this video for my nephew who loves Ben 10 for his birthday, it was a huge hit! He's asking for the next few in the series for Christmas already."
2,Not enough quality control,"This book follows in the grand tradition of books from companies like IDG and Macmillan: Not nearly enough quality control.Some examples of bloopers: (*) The author mentions that For Each ... Next is not supported in page 64. Voila! in page 91 he uses the same construct to show an example. (*) The description of PATH_INFO on page 142 is incorrect. (*) The last line of page 186 is a shoddy cut-and-paste job (*) ASP 3.0 is mentioned only in passing with the promise that the author will post new information as it becomes available. Obviously he did not have access to all the betas and release candidates of Windows 2000 put out by Microsoft.In sum, you can make this a usable book, provided that you try out the examples and ensure that they are bug free. In other words, you do the quality control.I wonder what the quality control editor for this book has to say...?"
3,Great book but too many syntax errors.,"The book has all the information you will need if you are a newbie like me with ASP. The errors can be a little annoying but if you pay attention, you'll catch them right away. If they fix all the errors in the next edition, this book will be a 5 star book."
3,think before you buy it,"As a professional web programmer, I can honestly tell you that this is not a good programming/reference book. The coding in the books works perfectly, but this book didn't give you much idea about connecting the database, (I need to do some researching through the internet) or sending e-mail using asp...If you are serious about ASP, you should try WROX books"
2,Too many bugs,"There are too many problems with the code examples in this book. The concepts are explained fairly well, and there is an accompanying web site (asptechniques.com), but the downloaded chapter examples are missing some files.I wish that there had been more care in the editing of the book; I don't like having to debug in a coding language that I'm trying to learn."
3,"Good book, bad code","There have been many others here who have complained about the buggy code in the examples. I must agree with this sentiment. I've ""spun my wheels"" for several hours over the first example in Chapter 13 and still have not corrected all of the errors.Aside from the buggy code, Eric Smith persists setting out examples where the data source connections are ONLY made through the laborous ""provider=Microsoft.jet.oledb.3.5.1"" etc. vs. a simple dim statement similar to ""const dblocation=""DSN=Nwind"""" (assuming you have rights to the server and can name your data source). I keep having to rewrite any connection statements, which is a real pain.The idea is good, but the execution lacks quality control. Some of the buggy code has been corrected on the web site ..., but only through page 87. The sample code zip files are incomplete. Maybe the publisher mixed up the first draft with the final copy!"
3,Could have been a great book,"The author is very knowledgeable and the example application used throughout the book is a good one. Instructive, thorough, and representative.The QA, however, is lacking. It's clear that no one sat down and tested all the sample code. There's no CD with the book and the sample code that you can download from the author's web site is incomplete and buggy.It's too bad that the author's hard work is spoiled by a lack of testing."
4,Letter Grade Rating: A-,"I own the first three seasons on DVD and I have not seen the rest of the series. Season 3 started out a little slow. It took six episodes to get to the meat of the story and the first five episodes felt like build up. After the season got rolling I was hooked. I found the storylines and new characters intriguing and I can't wait for season 4. The first season is still my favorite, but I did like season 3 better than season 2 (too much melancholy and depression between Brenda & Nate)."
3,Not Bad,"I have been following SFU as it has been released on DVD. I have to say that I am not a fan of Season 3. It has become a bit soap-opera-ish. Season 1 and 2 made you think and relfect on each episode, and the person who died in it, and what you could learn from their death. This one seems to have forgotten that; with the characters being two dimensional.I hope it picks up in Season 4.Saying that, I still think this is an awesome series."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased ""Season Three"" last week, December 15, and received a defective set of Dvds. My DVD player (Sony) cannot read any of the discs. I'm now stuck with this product due to the Return Policy (item has to be unopened).This will make me think twice before ordering Dvds from Amazon in the future."
3,At times the best season but then at other times the worst,"One of the most original shows ever enters it's third season adn it's a times the best but at other times it's worst. The good parts about it is Nat's charactor I really enjoyed his part this season, the last few episdoes where also really good with the whole dissaperince story line. I really enjoyed Kathy Bates's part in the series and Ruth's sister dose a great job. The bad part of the show is the dream parts are over done and Claire seems lost through the most of the season till the end when she gets pregnet. The show is still good but I fell it's losing it's pasase in the story lines and becouse at times there are too much cahractors. I cant wait to watch season 4."
2,problem with 1 disk,"When I bought the disks- ad never mentioned 1 disk had problems playing- it froze in spots and skipped- the ad said in very good cond,"
2,Entertaining for a little while,"This product is not awesome. It provides some trivia for the sports lover. But compared with other games out there today and for the price, I think there are better ones to choose. I would not purchase it again."
4,Escape to the Thrash Past,"Very cool EP from Intruder. I had this on cassette back in the day and wore it out. It was great to discover it on MP3 along with other great bands like VIKING, PANIC, TOXIK, AT WAR, and BLOOD FEST. All Thrash bands who came out in the late 80's just before the Grunge wave ended Metal's reign. It's nice to find this stuff and to re-live the great Thrash past. Now if the catalogs of bands like XENTRIX, NUM SKULL, and ATROPHY could make it to MP3, the world would be a better place. Great price, Great Tunes, Great Band!"
4,A solid book for anyone trying to get into med school.,"This book is almost exactly what I've been looking for. It has solid information on every step of the application process, from high school activities to choosing between multiple acceptances (we wish!). Also very useful was the section on international options, for those who have been rejected in the U.S. My only complaint is that nothing is mentioned about the importance of residency (i.e. what state you live in and what states you are applying to), and no mention is made of Canadian schools as an option.Overall, however, this is probably the best medical school applications resource that I have found,"
2,Alot of money for poor info,Now that I am in I am writing reviews on these books. The reviews for this one must have been written by the publisher. My friend lent me this one because he told me to save my money. You can spend alot of time reading this and not getting much from it. Better to spend time studying for the MCAT's and reading a more concise admissions book. Rec. Princeton Review and Insider's Guide by Toyos.
2,eh,not all that impressive. if you want something like this you could easily create it on your own. it has a board with rooms found in the house and a die with different options.
3,Country alt. / Rock,"Nothing sounds like this Band. They are a collection of every kind of music you and your parents loved. At moments they sound like Neil Young, Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan, then they fuse into a jazzy, banjo playing alternative rock band. The best picks of the album are ""Coronado"", ""I was your Man"", and ""No Goodbyes""Check it out, Good stuff."
3,For what it is......,"Typical of such books, it greatly exagerates much of the events it describes. I found the sections dealing with the South America and Russian trips to be quite interesting. Written durring the period when the press did ""not have Richard Nixon to kick around"" it is clearly a step to rehabilitate his image from the defeat to JFK and the pathetic loss to Jerry Brown's father that tarnished his image to the point of irrelevance.In the end his egomania and lack of respect for the laws he was supposed to uphold, made him a disaster for the country. This book is an insight into the other Nixon, the bright pragmatic man, who trained hard for 25 years to be president, in spite of being handed the VP spot at a very young age as a sop to the Mc Carthy crowd (the 50's version of the Tea Party for you young folks, look it up) he was still hard working and very knowledgable. When one reads Nixon, one get a sense of what might have been."
3,The Hard Corps,"The Hard Corps (2006) has Van Damme playing an ex special force solider, Phillip Sauvage, who is hired as a bodyguard to the former World Heavyweight boxing champion, Wayne Barclay. Years before, Wayne had helped the rap mogul Terrell Singletery get sent to prison, but now the rapper is out and he wants revenge.The Hard Corps is another Van Damme film that I have never heard of before and is less action-packed and more of a thug drama. Besides from Van Damme and Vivica A. Fox, the acting is not great and neither is the direction of the film. The plot is interesting and the action scenes, the few that there are, are entertaining."
5,Underrated,"What a good thug, action movie. I couldn't go to sleep until the movie was over at 3 am. I've watched it over and over. Can't beat the price."
1,Last Van Damme for me,"Van Damme will keep making these awful pictures until fans like me quit buying them, I quit.The shame is that his new movies are most likely watched by his fans and yet very little in them appeals to fans, IMO. Why?"
4,Great Movie!,"Great movie, wish he would do more smiling. I guess it's hard tobe a tough guy when you smile. Unless it's an evil Vincent Price one. He had kind of a "" Horror Movie"",carrer. Buckets of stage blood. Anyway, in the last ten years I like this movie Jean did. It isn't as dark as some of his other rescent movies. Has good action sequences. Reminds me of some his earlier stuff. My favorite is, ""Quest"" I give this one about 6-7 out of ten. Billy"
1,"Just kill me, please!!!","I'm a big Van Damme fan, I own all his movies, even this one, but you don't have to do that!!!Avoid this movie, it's the worse of the worse ( I repeat I'm a big fan of JCVD ).Bad acting, bad directing, bad story.Don't make the same mistake I did, you have to avoid this movie and Derailed at all costs."
3,Not bad,"They're not bad (at least not for the sale price). The stones are fairly sizeable and, as for color, they sort of disappear in my brunette hair. Some people might find that disappointing, but I think it's kinda neat, and they've become a favorite pair.Would've been four star but I dropped a star due to the leverback latches being pretty lousy. On one of the earrings, it's out of alignment and won't snap firmly over the hook. It either ends up beside it, or a few millimeters open. I don't think I'm going to lose the earring because of it, and it certainly doesn't show, but it demonstrates a lack of quality."
3,Lighter,"I was a little dissapointed about the colour of the stone,it's much lighter than the picture,but they look nice and are wearable"
4,earrings,the only thing i was a little disappointed in was the weight of the gold on the clasp. other than that i love them.
3,Cheaper quality than they appear,"These earrings were a disappointment, especially considering how much they cost. It's too bad too because the stones are actually quite nice: good size, nice color, well cut. But they are set in such cheap findings, they make the earrings appear chintzy. I would pass on these."
1,TRIPE,"Georgia Holt, Cher's mother, helped to write this book and it shows. Everything is glossed over or sanitized except for what the awful intrusive fans inflict on the poor little darlings. Written alot like a reverse Enquirer, except without it's structure or organization, and written by the stars or the stars flunkies instead of an unbiased and/or rabid reporter."
2,A last resort.....,"""Demon Knight"" was a great first venture into the realm of full length feature for the people behind ""tales from the crypt"". This follow up, however, relies on humour rather than a mixture of scares and laughs to drag the story along. It almost seems like it was made for television. If your hunting for something horrific to watch, make this your last resort.."
4,Miller is at his PEAK in this film,"Ok, i'm a christain and find the idea of a bordello sick, cheap, and trampish. But i had to rent this because i've always been a fan of Denis Miller, and not only did i watch it twice that night (it's a short hour and a half long movie, twice is even shorted than that excuse for a movie TITANIC) but i ended up buying the movie. The bordello part of it, disgusting as it my be, wasn't played that much but it allowed Miller to exploit his grade a humor and he's never been funnier."
3,Humor makes it,"So it's not particularly original, but Miller's wisecracking and the assortment of attractive vampires make this movie fairly entertaining. Intro has some genuine chills."
4,Cool movie...,"""Tales From The Crypt"" aint your average style in horror movies. TFTC combines awesome comedy with great special effect horror/action. I'd recomment this movie to ever horror fan out there. Its a blast..."
2,I think that this movie had a lot of pointless nudity.,This movie was one of the most imature movies that I have ever seen. This movie had so much nudity in it that I forgot that I wasn't watching a porno.
3,It's good not-so-clean fun,"Dennis Miller is really funny in this. He's got these one-liners throughout the whole movie that are priceless. And whats-her-name gets an A++ on the shwing-o-meter. That guy from Fright Night is pretty good too as the evangelist/rock star. There's one scene in patricular with him that alone makes this movie worth owning. There are lots of [body parts] throughout (er, mammery glands) and an HBO production factor that gives it the extra ooomph a movie like this needs. I'd give it four stars (because I liked it more than the average joe) but I don't want to be misleading. Grab one if your a collector, you won't be dissappointed, and they're going fast- this is currently out of print. It also fairs much better than the other ""Tales From The Crypt"" that are available on DVD."
1,I wish there was a zero- star option...,"This movie was god- awful and should only be viewed if you want to laugh at a bad, bad movie. Dennis Miller was truly the only redeeming thing about this film, and I would only give his performance 3 out of 4 stars; the material was funny, but it unintentionally made a bad movie worse. Angie Everheart was incapable of delivering even a poor performance; all she had to do was convince the audience she was at least trying to act- frankly, she just chewed the scenery. All of the other stars in the film, Corey Feldman and Erika Eleniak were moderate..."
1,Garbage,"I'm a real fan of Tales From the Crypt. I've seen the majority of the episodes and all 3 of the movies (yes, there's a third one, that was broken into parts and syndicated as episodes of the show). The series prided itself in being horrifying and having great twist endings. This movie was nothing like that at all. It was almost a parody of horror movies, but that wasn't the intention at all. Even Dennis Miller, my favorite comedian, couldn't hold the humor together... and still disowns it to this day! I can't think of a single reason that anyone would want to see this movie."
1,stupid,"This is the stupidest movie from TALES FROM THE CRYPT ever.why waste your time watching this when you could watch a real TALES FROM THE CRYPT movie like,DEMON KNIGHT."
4,Beautiful and Fun,"For those of you who have not seen this movie before, this is at least worth renting. Angie Everheart is the most beautiful vampire to ever hit the screen. She is very powerful and seductive at the same time. If you are a Dennis Miller fan then this movie is a must see, it reaks of his sarcasm and wit. This is one of those movies that you don't have to wonder if they are following the traditional vampire theme or not. It has beautiful women, a little gore, and a whole lot of humor."
2,Ugh. 2.5 stars,"O.K. O.K. I am extremely tolerant of these horror films, (I couldn't help but like deep rising) but this was just old. This vampire thing is completely outdone. Whoever thought of them must be turning over in his grave (or rising from it!). Don't get me wrong. Its not a bad movie. Its nice to watch on a friday night with friends. It wasn't that funny. Except for the guy who was high. My advice? Watch it twice. Its much more enjoyable and funny the second time of viewing. But, still, reflecting upon it, It was just unoriginal and repetative. It could have been a lot better. 2 stars is underrating it though. 2.5.What I tell my friends is, ""Its about a whorehouse full of vampires. Big Deal"" See it for yourself and make up your own mind."
1,0 STARS: Sorry excuse for a vampire movie,"When I first saw ""Bordello Blood"", I was so disappointed in Dennis Miller...he is a good actor in certain situations, but for his to do garbage like this is inexcusable. In fact, Miller looked more ridiculous in this movie than he did as a MNF analyst. This movie was supposed to be a vampire movie and while there are some vampires in it, one can easily see that this movie is a total joke and the crypt keeper and others involved in the making of this movie had to laughing when they made it knowing it was not scary and not any good. This is a waste of a serious horror movie fan's time...if you want camp humor and lame comedy fine, but don't call this a horror movie. Thank you."
5,Welcome Back Horror Fans,"Tales from the crypt does it again, this is the second full movie they have done. this is a awesome movie. yet another great one. and john kassier is back as cryptkeeper. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
2,"a bit witty, a lot flat","I remembered seeing this movie back when it first came out, on the singular draw of Dennis Miller. My memory was that it certainly wasn't going to cure any diseases any time soon, but that it was very enjoyable in a camp sort of way. As a result, when I stumbled across the title somehow, I got a wild hair and ordered it up. I'm not sure what I was thinking when I first saw it, but I certainly didn't have a repeat experience. It's not one of those movies that improves with a second viewing...even after multiple years have passed. Miller is enjoyable when he's at his wise-cracking best, and there's some good work done by a supporting character or two, but the effect was largely disappointing, stale, and flat. The predictability and contrivance of the ending didn't help the experience at all. If you can rent it or buy it for a buck, it's worth it for the occaisional one-liner. Otherwise, save your money."
4,Very Good,I just recently ordered this movie. Works fine. Minor scratches but no biggy like a said works fine. LOVE THE MOVIE
4,Willard Memoir; or Life and Times of Major Simon Willard,The cover of this 1858 book is loose after opening it twice but we will care for it as a memoir of our family history. Major Simon was the first of many generations of Willards in his line. My grandmother Inez was the last named Willard in her line. Her son (my father) sired nine children - mostly sons as Simon and his children sired children numbering in the upper teens - mostly sons. We will add the additional information we discover to the books we prepared for my siblings and copy them for the grandchildren who are thrilled to have ancestors who helped found our country.
5,Fantastic smell,"Both my partner and myself like this aftershave so much that although it is no longer sold in New Zealand, we have brought it through Amazon.com!Need i say more?"
3,Different Than I Expected,"I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this book. For the cost $... I thought I would be getting a book filled with full color photographs of the embroidery and a great deal of text. But there's little text and every single picture is done in artwork. This would be very nice, except the artwork is not photo-realistic so I feel I'm missing out on some of the fine details of the embroidery. It is a nice book and the author did a great deal of research and artwork...but still. It was a little disappointing."
1,Worse Christmas Gift ever,I bought this camera as a gift for my teenage son. It seemed to work fine but no disk was included to download the pictures. Went back to the store where it was purchased and none of them include the disk. Even though the package states software included.
2,On the fringes of history and interest,"This book had the potential to be interesting, but the approach - a collection of interviews and profiles - makes for a barely interesting read. I do not necessarily criticize the author. But it's clear that the subject is difficult, and it's uncertain how cooperative and honest the subjects could be.My primary disappointment is that you don't really get any new insights into the chief subjects - the infamous parent - and what the children have to say is somewhat drab and uninspiring.Indeed, rather than a work of non-fiction it could be better conceived as a fiction or cinematic work."
5,"Great, but not worth the current price","This is without a doubt one of the best sourcebooks on Italian Renaissance clothing ever. However, it is also a *very* tiny book, useful but by no means exhaustive or even complete. While it is a good investment in general for any costumer, I regard the current going price of $200.00+ as *way* beyond anything this book is worth. I'd advise finding it in the local library (many university libraries have it), xeroxing what you need for research, and spending the remaining $249 on a trip to the Bahamas to read it on the beach."
4,This was a replacement for an identical lens that went bad on me after 14+ years,"This was a replacement for a nidentical lens that went bad on me after 14+ yearsWill not click on review again as too many ""rules"""
4,Chinese Brush(Learn to Paint)Everything you need to know ...,"In this book, Jane Evans, author, presents not only copies of her artistry, but also gives the reader insight into: the art of Chinese Brush; explains the materials you need to accomplish your entry into this particular form of art; the basic techniques you will learn; how to apply 'washes'; how to accomplish painting flowers, plants, birds, insects, fish and aquatic creatures, animals, people, landscapes ... trees, grasses, mountains, hills, waterfalls, bridges. From start to finish ... including mounting your art ... Jane has left nothing out.In a world of Chinese Brush Art, where books are hard to come by, this is a great buy!"
4,"Margaret, Australia","I didn't think that this book lived up to all the other chronicles, but with a writer like Roberta still makes a good read."
3,An intriguing encounter,"This CD is a document of a concert encounter between Derek Bailey & two percussionists of African origin--the great Louis Moholo and the less-known Thebe Lipere. The music is much less mercurial than usual for Bailey, a series of gently rhythmic, almost tranced improvisations; despite the double percussion, the music is mostly quite quiet. I like the disk very much, but have to issue a serious caveat: the recording is one of Incus's less satisfactory jobs, with the guitar disappearing for long stretches into near-inaudibility. Bailey has always avoided conventional structures of ""soloist"" and ""accompaniment"" (while he can often be abrasive & disruptive, he can just as often take a role like that of swing-era guitarists Freddie Green or Teddy Bunn, patiently filling in the background texture), but this recording's poor balance makes it hard to tell what's going on."
5,GREAT BOOK,"This book is great. As a lover of London's history, I can honesty say this book is a pleasure to read. It is simply written, yet very informative."
4,Organizational Behavior,"As a college student, I would recommend this textbook as a great guideline in regards to organizational behavior. The textbook, although a little lengthy, is easy to read and allows the reader to relate to the real life concepts. The book draws the reader in by providing self-surveys, graphs, and examples of successful popular companies.The authors did a wonderful job of portraying the important points by highlighting key words and displaying bold definitions on the same page as the reading. I feel that the book could be improved by limiting the amount of reading, such as removing extra conversation and getting straight to the point rather than provide entertainment."
4,Organizational Behavior (3rd Edition),"Organizational Behavior, was up-to-date and contained a great deal of information about the general topic of business. Specifically it focused right on the subject at hand, organizations and their behaviors. I learned a lot from this book. The authors used real-life examples when applying what they taught throughout the reading. The book combined with lecture has taught me a lot about the subject!"
4,Great Series. I read them all,"Lynn Gardner has done her research when she wrote this series. Having served in the U.S. Military for over 20 years, I know about some of the treats out there in this 'not so safe' world. These series are hard to put down. As soon as I was finished with one book, I had to order the next. Highly recommend them."
1,Be warned...,"I do not recommend using this book as a guide to developing a story for the screen. The authors have a great idea here. It's just that they have only a basic understanding of the elements of story, or at least that is all they mentioned here.However, if you are brand new to screenwriting this can get you started writing, and that is a very good thing. Do yourself (and your audience) a favor, though, and find different material to teach you how to fill in the blanks.That being said, their worksheets gave me a good starting point to creating my own worksheets, as I am graphic design challenged."
3,the best new book out there!!!!,I just purchased this book and I love it!!! I was amazed at how easily it was to understand and to navigate through. The worksheets are easy to understand and fun to do. The confusing breakdown of a movie is masterfully broken down here in fun and exciting chapters with easy to fill out worksheets. The Screenplay Workbook will most definitely improve your writing and conceptualization of your end screenplay. Definitely a must have for screenplay writers. If I were on a reality show I wouldn't vote this out!
1,THIS BOOK IS TRASH,Don't buy this book. It is useless. Honestly the worst book on screenwriting I ever read.
4,Oh My Goodnesss,"This series, ""Twin Peaks"", continues to intrigue my mind as I watch. I mean, I find something new about it everytime I watch it. I remember sneaking to cut on the TV and risking a severe tush-whoppin' just to view this cult-classic. If you like mystery and suspense, this is the DVD to get!"
5,Why people complain about no pilot?,"I don't understand why people complain about the series not including the pilot. They don't hold the rights to it, therefore they can't include it in the set. You can purchase it seperately from here on Amazon[.com] or off Ebay.This is a GREAT series! I can't wait for season 2 to come out! As a fan of Lynch, and a new fan of the TP series, I love this. I really wish I had watched it when it originally aired. Now I'm torn between reading what happens in the second season, or waiting for it to come out on dvd. I waited a while to pick this boxset up because I was afraid it might not be worth the money for me, being a ""blind"" purchase and all. But boy was I wrong! This is a great collection that I would suggest any fan of Lynch pick up, or any person who liked the Fire Walk with Me movie."
1,no pilot,"totally messed up. i plan to return this and request a refund because there is no warning that the pilot, the most important episode, is not included. there should be a warning to customers and the fact that there isn't shows how little amazon cares about the quality of its service and the satisfaction of its customers."
3,"Good, but incomplete","Twin Peaks may be great, and I'm glad to have it available on DVD, but I think it's really deceitful to market this as ""the complete first season."" That's really a lot of bull, and they have you over a barrel once you've purchased it. Why... wouldn't they include the pilot in this set (rights or no rights)? I had looked forward to introducing my friend to this great series last night only to have the evening ruined because the so-called first episode already had a two-hour jump on the narrative. That is ridiculous and I resent having to buy another dvd to get the pilot. Harrumph!"
2,missing pilot,Disappointed that the pilot episode is not included. It makes it difficult to enjoy a series when the pivotal episode is missing.
3,Yummy in my tummy,"I watched this and was very excited, i wish it could go on and on and on. Unfortunately it doesn't go on, so I ate the DVDs and casing and made a small poo castle. Isn't that wonderful?"
1,extremely disappointed,"This review has little to do with the original series itself, but rather with the extremely poor quality of the DVD set I received. Clearly this has been edited, and the quality of the copy is horrible. At first my DVD player wouldn't read it at all, then when it finally did, there were major skips in the copy at critical points. I wouldn't recommend this item as a purchase for anyone."
2,OK Retro stuff doesnt stand the test of time!,"Its interesting to re-visit this show---but I have to say big doses of it are harder to stand than they were when it first came out. In those times it was cutting edge tv! These days, compared with say Six Feet Under its rather passe.Nice to have...but really a once watcher!"
1,No pilot = terrible DVD,"I, too, sat down to watch ""Twin Peaks"" for the first time and was seriously annoyed to hear ""Previousy on Twin Peaks..."" I am sending mine back for a refund. When my friends watched this years ago, many complained of being frustrated. That must be the producers goal. They've succeeded in doing it again all these years later. And only 3 seconds into the DVD!!!!!"
2,"Great Series, Horrible tapes","While the Twin Peaks series is one of the best things ever to appear on a TV, these tapes dont do the series justice. First they attempt to pack 5 episodes on each VHS tape, and in order to do this they are done in very low quality. Both the audio and video suffer, though the audio is really the worst part. After viewing the tapes a few times, it seems like they may actually be getting worse, the audio has almost completely dropped out in some places. My advice is to get out of the dark ages and get the DVDs"
3,Good as far as it goes ......,"This is going to sound familiar, but this collection really should have had the pilot included: this mystifying omission is reason for the three-star rating. It was hard to explain to my non-Peaks-aware wife why the narrative began seemingly in the middle of the DVD.Even so, as a Twin Peaks fan, it was great experiencing the episodes again, and I'm not sorry that I purchased this set. The packaging of the set is attractive, the extra features interesting (the Log Lady's original preamble was a very pleasant addition), and the video is clean and pretty.If anything, they've guaranteed a couple of more purchases out of me--one for the pilot, and one for the second season."
5,Twin Peaks saved my life,"Twin Peaks is, in my opinion, the most enthralling piece of audio/visual media I have ever seen. There will be a DVD release, but either way, everyone should see this amazing television series from the greatest director of all time, David Lynch"
1,Give us a better product!,"I absolutely agree with all the reviewers who have put it so well...WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE SERIES SET WITHOUT THE 2 HOUR PILOT MOVIE?!?!? Paramount is already on my ""no buy"" list due to their shananagins with the release of the first season of ""I Love Lucy""! a few years back Really...What does it take (stateside) to get the picture? Enough said."
5,Next Please!,What happened to you guys out there in the DVD world. Did you forget that there are still more episodes to release? What good is the first session with out the rest of the sessions? Think about it - if there a x ammount of people who bought the first session - then there is x amount of people who want the rest. Get it together folks - start working and do something right for once.
3,THE FIRST SEASON review.,"My review is about how the first season is packaged. The pilot episode isn't included in this particular version, ""Twin Peaks - The First Season (Special Edition),"" so unless you luck up on a cheap one, not likely, you may be better off buying the GOLD BOX SET. but double check if the pilot is included.the show is great, though, but won't make much sense without the pilot."
5,great - even without the pilot,"Incredibly clear dvd ... I too wish the pilot was there, but it's easy to get one from ebay. Not as clear as this one, but at least you'll own it on dvd. Looking forward to the second season ..."
2,Have you ever walked into a movie late?,"I would sooner go back to see a movie at a later date than to miss the first five minutes of it. When I sat down to watch my most eagerly anticipated DVD since I have owned my player, I was almost numb with disbelief. How could ""Twin Peaks-The First Season"" be complete without the singular most crucial element, the pilot episode? I own hundreds of DVDs and this is, without a doubt, the most botched ripoff on the market today. If there had been a warning that this mockery of a 'first season' did NOT include the pilot, I wouldn't have bought it. I can't even bring myself to watch it, I am so infuriated."
3,NO PILOT EPISODE,"The first episode on the first disc of Season One box sets should not start out with, ""Previously on [insert name of show[..."" The Twin Peaks pilot episode is, even as a stand-alone, one of the best pieces of TV programming ever aired, and it is crucial for understanding the series, as it sets up the entire show (well, most of the good parts of the show, anyway, before it started meandering somewhat aimlessly). So where is it? TP is a great show, but this package was a real let-down due to the lack of the pilot."
2,Where the hell is the pilot?,"As long as we have been waiting for this series to come out on DVD, it is a rip-off for them not to have included the two hour pilot in the four DVD set. What do they need FOUR DVDs for for just 7 episodes plus some fluff? Whis is here is great... but Two Stars only for leaving out the pilot."
1,Incomprehensible Junk,"The DVD set is bogus without the pilot. My wife and I had never seen the the show and initially thought ""maybe the 'as seen in the previous episode' is one of those wierd but supposedly endearing David Lynch things."" No, in fact, it's just incomplete crud due to licensing difficulties.I plan to return my set after watching only the first episode. Maybe the series was half decent, but the DVD set is DEFECTIVE. Save your money--this is half-baked junk."
3,"So would I waste my $200 for the ""Twin Peaks Complete set""","Please let me know-- crowescooter@aol.com-- if this has all episodes 1-29. and is the pilot a must have to episode 1-29.I remember watch'g the TV series ,I kick my self for not tape'g it. LOL"
5,There's always music in the air.,"This set rocks. The picture is so beautiful, and the dolby surround is excellent. (the DTS track is good too, but i can't tell the difference except that the DTS is louder)if you're a fan of the show, or of david lynch, you have to have this set. note: if you're seeing it for the first time, you should get the pilot episode too. i'd get it from ebay. they have lots of copies of the import dvd for cheap.i hope season two comes soon, and is as great as this set is. i'm looking forward to seeing the final episode with such vivid colors."
2,Why wasn't the Pilot Included???,"All right. I loved Twin Peaks. I wanted to share the magic with my husband who has never seen one episode. I was sooo disappointed last night when I popped the DVD into the player, clicked on Episode one, and heard ""Previously on Twin Peaks""...Previously? What the heck? Where's the REAL first episode? Artisan make a HUGE blunder by not including the pilot on this DVD. It's a shame they had to ruin this DVD collection by not including the very first episode -- without the pilot, it's hard for somebody new to catch up.I'm tempted to return my copy back to Amazon."
3,No pilot,"Rights or no rights, this set will fall far far short of five stars without the superb pilot. Someone needs to get some lawyers in action or the ""Twin Peaks"" set will be decidedly ""in""complete. And, no, an eight-year-old VHS tape of the European theatrical release bought off ebay for fify dollars just won't cut it."
2,a simple shame,"I could'nt wait to get this beautiful DVD, as I'm a big Twin Peaks fan, but I've been really disapointed to realize that no subtitles at all were on this issue. Not even in english for people who does'nt ear well. No spanish, nor french (some people in Canada speak french you know ?)I tryed to get in touch with the company, but they ignored me, as arogant as possible."
4,"Why, Oh why Isn't Season 2 on DVD????","How is it that some of the worst Television series have made it onto DVD, and the beautiful, dark, sublime TP has not followed?Shame on you!I bought the whole series on vhs in the early 90's. and after watching the first season on dvd, realized the incredible beauty of David Lynch's eye that i missed the first time...why should i be forced to watch this great epic on VHS? The 2nd season is even greater than the first....shame on you to deny us the DVD version of this great, epic, 2nd season!!"
3,Twin Peaks,This would have been 5 stars but the pilot episode for the series wasn't included in the first season which makes this dvd collection feel much shorter than it should be.
1,Not including the Pilot - ruined the DVD,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the DVD today. When I played the first episode (believing it to be the ""first"" episode, hence the very first time we see any of the characters...) it was preceeded by a ""previously on Twin Peaks..."" I couldn't believe the DVD was released without the pilot attached to it...why even bother? For people like myself who haven't seen this show in over 10 years, it's hard to remember all that happened in the very first show. ""The First Season"" - right. Just don't expect it to be ""The COMPLETE First Season"". Extremely disappointing."
4,great tv show,"great show, but the first season just isn't enough to be satisfied with. you never find out who kills laura palmer in this season..."
5,Wonderful show!!!,"When TP first was shown I did not watch it. I had no idea what to expect when my boyfriend bought the series and told me that we were going to watch them all. I got completly addicted to David Lynch's television masterpeice. Of course Agent Dale Cooper is the best FBI man television has ever seen, (sorry Mulder), but all of the supporting cast is just as enjoyable. This is the most exciting, funny, and scary TV shows ever. Eveyone must buy all of the episodes on tape because you have to watch them all at once."
1,twin peaks vhs box set,"The ad said ""sealed in original packaging"" And indeed, it sure LOOKED like it was sealed, but the tapes were not in ""like new"" condition. There was static during the opening credits of each episode and a line at the top of the screen during the rest of them. This set was obviously played alot and was fast-fowarded while in play mode. It may not be the sellars fault, they may have recieved it themselves in this condition. This product was not what it was advertised to be."
2,Pilot NOT included?!?!?!? ARE YOU KIDDING?!?!?!?!?!?,"I've seen this and the extra features are pretty good, but to NOT HAVE THE PILOT EPISODE? Why on earth would ANYONE buy this without THE episode?? The one that started everything! I understand at the time it was tied up legally, but to put this out without it makes NO SENSE AT ALL. I will not buy this until this HUGE error is corrected. If they DO re-release the set with the pilot, they need to include both versions. The one as it played on U.S. television, and the one that was edited as a stand-alone film for European release. And WHAT is taking so long for season two???"
1,No Pilot greatly devalues this set,"Sadly, the absence of the pilot episode really hurts the value and appeal of this collection."
2,NOT the COMPLETE first season,"While I found the extra features to be great, and the intro by the log lady good, I must say this box set it quite a let down.Why? Because it is not the 1st season as stated on the box set, it is part of the first season. Gone is the 2 hour piolet episode which introduces the main characters, and where is the rest of the season?I only hope they do release the remainder of the series, as some of my favourite episodes were toward the end of series one.ie - Madie's demise, Harold, and Who killed Laura Palmer?"
2,"Good show, lousy transfer on VHS.","I'm glad I didn't pay any more for this than I did. I'm not one to throw out video cassettes just because they're video cassettes. But I have some old VHS's that still show a good clear picture for the format. The tapes in this collection, however, do not. It was all I could do to get through the first episode. No matter how I tried to adjust the tracking it was of no use. If you're going to buy this series, splurge and get the DVD's. I wish I had. At least I didn't pay much for it."
5,A great show !,"I'm a Twin Peaks fan since the show open, at ABC-TV in 1990. Now than the entire series turn to VHS tapes, all I have to say is : If you never watch the series when it was on television, watch it now, I totally recommend. And for the ones than already watch the series : Watch it again, it won't hurt ! Laura Palmer will change your life, as change mine."
2,Twin Peaks Season 1,"I was looking at the Season 1 for awhile and then decided to check out the UK release of Twin Peaks. It was released by Paramount in 2002 and contains the pilot. So if you don't want to wait for paramount to release it in the US check it out. It's currently listed at slightly over 15, so not to bad.Hope this helped, otherwise this release isn't to bad"
3,burn the fans?,"I have to reiterate what a lot of these reviews say. I bought the box expecting ""The First season,"" but what I got was ""The First Season Excluding the necessary, informative pilot.""The big problem I have is this: why burn the fans? I would expect about 90% of the people buying this would be Twin Peaks fans who can recite the quirky dialogue. These are die-hard viewers who have suffered with the VHS version long enough. The DVD's look great, there's no complaining there.These fans will keep Twin Peaks alive and popular for years to come, why spite them? Why rip them off? Why deceive them with this phony ""First Season?""Being a fan, yes, I will buy the pilot if and when they release it. Will I be happy? No. Will I praise the money-hungry studio execs who pine for my every dollar? No. Will I continue to be a fan? Yes. Do I respect the series? No.Apologies are needed all around, and you can start with the fans."
1,Special edition ?,"This edition isn't subtitled at all. Hard when you are a deaf person ! This is what they call ""special edition""..."
3,"A Review of ""some guy"" (in jeans)'s review of Twin Peaks","I think some guy in jeans needs to worry less aboot Twin Peaks and more aboot his jeans...And yes, it's a great DVD and I would love to see season's 2 and 3 follow."
3,"I love Twin Peaks , but the quality here iragitates .","I think customers should be warned that the series is recorded in slow speed to increase amount of space on the video . Rather than double the amount of tapes included in the package , the company just destroyed the integrity of the tapes they did use by recording in SP . On the other hand , the series is wonderful and Amazon.com does have the best price ."
1,FRAUD!,"Not only am I returning this incomplete ""complete"" first season because it doesn't have the pilot episode, but also because it doesn't say anything about the missing episode on the packaging until you have it home and open it. And even then you don't know for certain that it's incomplete until you actually start the first disc and see footage from a previous episode that you don't even have. $50 for fraud! Nice try Artisan, I guess Blair Witch 2 didn't make enough money."
2,No pilot?,"To the guy who defended this box set by saying those who complained should shut up and buy it on ebay: what world are you living on? When people buy a box set stating that it's the first season, WE EXPECT THE WHOLE THING! Why not subtitle it with FIRST SEASON MISSING PILOT! nowhere on the box does it even STATE this.BE WARNED!"
2,No Pilot!,"What a mistake. This DVD set doesn't include the pilot. You are left with a brief synopsis of what happened in the pilot at the beginning of the first episode. Terrible, terrible, terrible! I guess I'll need to buy the separate pilot DVD.... Oh wait, its not available. Shoot me."
5,Twin peaks- damn fine show,"Twin peaks is the most groundbreaking show ever put on T.V. It delves into areas never looked at by any other telivision shows. It is sureal, picuresque and truly electrifying. If only it had have been finished, buying the tapes is as close as you can get. Get them and experience the strange world of Twin Peaks once again."
5,Way too cool!!!,"David Lynch is a master, and Cooper is just too sexy for words. I have watched the tapes with my husband at least 10 times, and we still love it (except for that whole James/Donna thing. That got tired the second time through). What I want to know is if there's going to be a follow up. I'd love to see what happens since the Bad Agent Cooper escaped from the Black Lodge, and trapped the Good Agent Cooper in. I was so upset when I saw that last episode and realized that it was the very last episode. Anyway, loved it, loved the diary of Laura Palmer, just want to get the Cooper tapes now! (Damn Fine TV Series!)"
4,"Aussie review ""Awe inspiring , sigh!!""","Well this DVD box set has been a long time coming, but it was absolutely worth the wait. Box design, picture quality, sound, features all brilliant - I especially like the cast interviews and episode features which include deleted scenes and commentaries. The episode introductions by the log lady are, well, 'out there..' and are, therefore, perfect!! If you are an Aussie Peaks fan, and your DVD player is for all regions, you have nothing to fear with purchasing this version (I've checked with Australian distributors and they don't know when the box set will be released in Australia, so aside from the ...exchange rate my feeling is 'why wait?') My only critique would be the size and colour of the text font, which is a little hard on the eyes. Otherwise, bring on the second box set! Please. Quickly."
1,Cheap Imitation of Chaps,this is a knock off and a very cheap one at that. Stay away from this seller he has no ethical standards at all. The product was mostly alcohol and I made them send me pick up lable and full refund uncluding shipping. Ralf Lauren has actually stopped the manufacturing of this product and only available as clearence at some store only. I have switched to another brand. Too bad RL discontinued this very popular product.
3,.1875 ounce,I haven't fished it yet but I do feel like the picture of the entire set is VERY misleading. I picked that one in the .1875oz size and I ended up paying $25 for ONE jig.
4,A good off-model Parker novel,"Most Parker novels involve both a heist and the aftermath, but ""Breakout"" is almost all aftermath. Stark gives us not one but three breakouts - Parker keeps finding himself trapped in one way or another - which makes it feel a bit like a darker version of ""The Hot Rock"" where the thieves keep trying to steal a diamond over and over again. Some good supporting characters here. If there's anything wrong with it, it's that the first third (dealing with a jailbreak) is stronger than the rest of the novel, but the rest of the novel is good enough that that hardly matters by the end."
4,AN ESCAPE STORY THAT WILL HOLD YOU 'TIL THE END,"I would not call this a masterpiece, but would say this story is a good read. It is about 3 felons who escape jail awaiting their court hearings. It is about how they got out and then how they eluded the authorities and also their planning and carrying out a heist. I did not think the very end was so great, yet it did not hinder the whole story in any way."
3,Good but not great,"I've read many of the Parker novels and this isn't one of the better ones. Parker is generally the sharpest knife in the drawer. He has an inspired plan for pulling off a robbery or getting out of the trouble. In Breakout, he falls into problem situation after problem situation. This time instead of planning, he just reacts -- creating more trouble and mess.Breakout also has some improbable action. After one of his crew is arrested, Parker gets that member released by leaning on a witness. Moments after the release takes place, the witness cracks and tells the police about the coercion. Rather than re-arrest Parker's comrade, the police just tail the car and hope for the best! Likewise, the prison breakout is so dependent on coincidence, it's not up to Richard Stark's (Donald Westlake's) usual style.In the end, Parker needs to rely on the kindness of strangers to save him from the law... and that's not like Parker at all."
3,Meh,"I like Parker books, and this one is typical; but I couldn't see an actual climax and finish in this one. On top of that we lose several characters along the way and never find out what happened to them. Overall, its your typical Parker fare. Same action, same dialogue, same characters. Sometimes I like reading the same stuff, but not really this time around."
1,Could not finish it,"I feel guilty writing a review for a book that I didn't complete. That said, this book was poorly written and hard to read. Not hard based on his examples or word use, but dry and lacking true insightful arguments. I think it was unoriginal and I was glad to get it back to the library.I was hoping to use the book in one of my courses, but thankfully will look to something else."
1,"A True Comedy, Hilarious","What can one say to such drivel. Read this and found his so called objectivity lacking. No meat, just small potatoes in a nice new shiny package. Don't bother, save your money and buy a book from someone who knows what they are talking about about. An excellent antidote to this is Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everythingwhere you can actually learn something useful."
4,Wirelessly Send Video from Computer to Projectors and More...,"This item has manufacturers part number MA-WL-DVI . You will receive a wireless access point, with a DVI out interface for your projector or panel. There is a DVI-VGA convertor in the box, but if you have a DVI in on your projector I recommend you use it.The device functions as an access point, so you will be connecting to it wirelessly. you will not be connected to another wireless network at the same time.for the intended purpose it works great."
3,Not As Good As I Expected,"Take your favorite anime theme songs, sing them quicker than normal and add a lot of electronic percussion, and you get this album.I can't say this is bad, but I will not be buying volume 2."
1,Wasted $$$$$$$,"I am an Anglo, living on the reservation, working in healthcare and have a strong desire to learn Navajo. Even my strong desire falls flat with this text.It was not clear to me that this book is useless without the cassettes, and when I found them, having overpaid for the poor quality of this book, I was not about to invest another $50.There are MUCH better learning resources and I recommend that you send your dollars in another direction."
4,One of the best I've seen,"Navajo is an extremely hard language to learn for the English speaker. This is due in part because of the verb system that exists in the Athabaskan language family. That being said, this book may be a little dated, but it is still very usable. The lessons are easy to follow and understand, and the verb paradigms are equally easy to understand. The lessons do not get into the 'nuts-and-bolts' of the verb system, but rather have you learn the full forms of a particular verb. The idea works, and does not bog you down with mind-bending grammar explanations at such an early stage. Thus this is easily something I would recommend to the beginning student of Navajo. (And as far as the price, now-a-days it is as easy as looking at the Amazon marketplace.)[My review of the audio is hereBreakthrough Navajo CDs & text]"
2,Just a brief Introduction to Biztalk,"This book come little bit too early. So those tiny information about Biztalk could only cover the JumpStart Kit, instead of a ""more complete"" Technology Preview / Alpha Version. This book is only for those who need a really quick and high-level introduction on what's Biztalk for. It's not for developers."
3,Based on alpha version of Biztalk Server,"The book is a good introduction to Biztalk and Biztalk Server 2000. It could be good course material for a Biztalk Server Lab.Anyway this book is based on the alpha version of Biztalk Server 2000, it includes photos that doesn't reflect the final product.The book life is very short."
3,"The good news is, this is the BEST BizTalk book available...","-The bad news is, this is the ONLY BizTalk Book available. The book is ""OK"" but the bulk of the book is about XML.It's an easy read for a geek, but doesn't get very specific or deep into BizTalk Technologies.Still, readinq it is quicker than playing around with the jumpstart kit.I hope somebody writes an ""in depth"" BizTalk book soon !"
2,Careful! MP3 format!,"The book is great, but these audio CDs would not play on our ordinary (Ok -OLDER!)CD player because they are MP3 format, we had to play them on a PC instead. As far as I can see, the format information is not visible in the product information."
5,Great,"Good seal all around no problems with water log. Stays good temp in the water never felt any cold, and easily unzips out of the water to keep a cool good wear no mater what the conditions. Overall comfortable in out and around the water. Bought one and would buy another."
4,Convenient Flash Drive,"I've had this drive for about four months, and it's been very dependable and handy.I use it to swap files between my wifes Mac and my PC. She has a scanner, which I don't have, so I'm often scanning files, and then use this flash drive to transfer it to my laptop.Nice, rubber finish, convenient tab to store the top when it's removed... overall, very handy drive! Also copies files very fast."
2,Not well made,"I expeced this to be a cover that you would slip your phone into and be able to use it as it opened, but this is just a clip rather than a cover."
1,In all due respect ...,"Who can deny that Beverly Sills was a marvelous soprano? She was a loyal, loving wife. She was always good to her mother. Altogether, she led a virtuous life. But it was hard for me to resist titling this review BEVERLY SILLY. The title ""Bubbles"" should give you a warning.This book is full of cuteness. It's embarrassing. Ms. Sills talks about all the wonderful things people said about her and all the wonderful things she said.As I said, the book is downright embarrassing"
2,Hi tek - whats the deal?,"I listened to all the tracks on this album and I cant understand. Hi-tek-you can do way better than this. Ive heard your work in the past and I know your potential, you can come with better beats than this for real. Lyricist lounge 2 and others you did had way iller beats. I guess you've been away for too long."
4,Tight Tracks,"This is a quality compilation from one of hip-hop's best producers. Several excellent tracks with great beats and flow from some lyricists I wasn't familiar with. If you liked Black Star but don't require thundering bass from every single track on a CD (some of my fav tracks on this are the slower ones), cop this CD. You'll find that you will listen to it a lot."
4,Stay Up On Your Teknology,"I am gonna keep it short and sweet. You need to get this CD in your rotation because when you start hearing other CDs compared to this you will start to appreciate the diversity and depth of the tracks. Hi Tek keeps the beats fresh and the guests bring lyrical firepower.Top 5 tracks:-""Keep it Moving"" feat. Q-tip, Kurupt, & Dion-""Jospehine"" feat. Willie Cottrell Band, Ghostface Killah & Pretty Ugly-""Where it Started At"" feat. Dion, Jadakiss, Papoose, Talib Kweli & Raekwon-""Let it Go"" feat. Dion & Talib Kweli-""Music"" feat. J. Dilla, Nas, Common, Busta Rhymes & Marsha AmbrosiusDon't get caught without it!!!"
3,Hi-Tek Falls short of previous CD,"Hi-Tek one of the hot producers out there, falls a little short on this colaboration. Most of the beats are hot and the production is decent overall but the overall experience lacks that hard-hitting hip-hop feel from the 1st CD. Takes a while to grow on you. Too many slow jams."
3,Delta Faucet RP32106 Single lever handle kit,"I could not use the item as the kit was not complete as pictured (the tempertature control [first piece on left] was not included only the screw was included). That was one of the parts that had broken on my old unit as well leaking water. It also took two weeks to arrive. ItemDelta Faucet RP32106 Single Lever Handle Kit with Cartridge for 17 Series, Chrome."
2,Handle tore first time used,"The plastic was too soft for my 4 year old Boarder Collie. Both sides of the handle tore wear it meets the ball on the first day of play. That part should be reinforced. Last year I bought a harder ball which lasted 10 months of daily play. I will by that one again, if it is available."
2,"8"" Gripper ball","The new Griper Ball lasted about half an hour with our dog Missy. I bought it to replace one that was at our dog park that she love to play with. She would run & run & just have a ball with it until the handle started breaking away from the ball. So I bought a replacement to leave at the dog park. Well, I gave it to her before taking it to the park and she had the handle already starting to come loose from the ball in about a half an hour. I plan to send it back."
5,canning accessory,"I purchased this product to use for canning and it does what it says it does and I am very happy with both the price, the shipping time and the product."
5,Use it for Vitamin C Serum,Love this! Dissolves fast and lasts forever. Just what my face needed! And here are the eight more words needed. :)
5,Good quality vitamin,Now always makes good products. This vitamin C powder disolves very easily in liquids. I put it in a bottle or glass of water daily. Great taste.
3,Bad packaging,"Product seems to be good- thats what 3 stars are for -I havent used it long enough to say anything muhc about the sameBut came in somewhat damaged packaging . The cover of the jar has a small tab to pull to remove the seal.The tab was half undered the lid itself- it took 2 of us to remove the seal. Under the seal there is a paper seal, which again was a little damaged.Wondering if it might have impacted the quality of the product.Keeping it as would be too much of a hassle to return the same"
2,Didn't work for me,"I am sure this is pure vitamin C like everybody else says it is. I don't like any additives myself, which is why I bought it. But there are two things about this that did not work for me1) It tastes bad. Really bad. Even though I pretty good about handling bad tastes, I couldn't handle this one.2) It was pretty hard on my stomach. So much that after trying a couple of times, I just couldn't try it again."
3,Nothing to write home about,"The order arrived in a timely manner.Packaged professional....As for the *Ascorbic* powder itself,very,tangy,very tart.....if you have ever eaten *sour* candy,this is the main ingredient....It bloats you a bit more than other *ascorbic powders* with lots more gas...but it works for it's purpose,if you can get pass the sour taste.I'm going back to Allergy Research Group -Buffered Vitamin C Powder"
3,Ken's Review,"I have read many great things about Ascorbic Acid however its taste is dreadfull. But mixed with orange juice its O.K., but I can't take a bottle of orange juice everywhere I travel, therefore I'am still looking for other ways to take this product that meets my lifestyle."
5,Yay!,"This stuff is really great. I was paying $$$ for a vitamin c serum that turned a dark yellow well before I had finished using it. These days, I make my own batch of C Serum daily, in the palm of my hand with a spray bottle. I spray one squirt of water into my hand, and then take a small fingertips worth of the Vitamin C Crystals and dissolve them in the water in my palm. It takes about 15 seconds for the crystals to dissolve, and then it's ready to put on my face. Sometimes it stings, but my expensive Vitamin C serum would sting when I first bought it, and then the stinging would go away (probably because it was no longer effective). Anyway, a little goes a long way with this stuff, and I really like how it makes my skin glow after I put it on. I'm so happy I found this :)"
4,great product,"I don't know how much of it is real or imagined, but I always feel so much better physically and mentally when taking ~2 grams of vitamin C per day (half in AM, half PM or so). I also take flax oil for omega 3, pomegranate concentrate, and green or black tea. I start craving the juice or soy milk w/ the tart C powder mixed in, just like I crave the other antioxidant rich foods/drinks I take daily. I think that is the body telling me this stuff is healthy.Be careful to rinse your mouth out well with a glass of water after drinking the C tho, and try not to get the C mix on your teeth in the first place, could strip your teeth otherwise. Maybe use a straw."
5,Great product,Love these ... Great for vitamin C Serum I make at home. Very fresh and will buy again. Cheaper than other site and was able to choose my size.
4,Citric Acid Powder,"The powder came quickly enough and was what I was expecting. The quality of the powder is not as high as the more expensive powders - it's not as ""tasty"" but is still good, especially for the price!"
5,Great product with many uses,I use this in a spray bottle to remove chlorine from my skin after getting out of the pool. Works great.
3,Inexpensive form of Vitamin C,"For cold season, for adults and children, this inexpensive form of Vitamin C is a bargain. Just mix it with fruit juice and drink.However, drinking such acidic liquid can eventually erode the enamel on your teeth. Try using a straw when you drink this."
4,Fun & Tasty Popcorn Ideas,"This is a fun little book full of all kinds of variations on our old standard popcorn treats.They have recipes for salty, cheesy, spicy, sweet and gooey to list a few. Very creative, and though we haven't tried them all, (there are more than 100 recipes), we've enjoyed those we have.The only thing I don't care for about the book is that it's a little too cute for my taste. I have, however given it several times as a wedding gift along with a corn popper, and the ""lovers"" theme fits those occasions perfectly."
5,vitamins,Excellant product. Recommended to me after 3rd bone surgery in 1 1/2 years. Seemed to help a lot. Bone is actually growing now!!
2,Did not agree with me,"Unfortunately this product upset my stomach - I have a sensitive stomach. Also, there are too many pills to take at one time and they are too large."
3,Ortho Molecular Pro Bono,Very expensive and a lot of pills to take everyday. Waiting for results of bone scan to see if they work. Have heard many women don't have any improvement.
4,Price could have been better,"Overall purchase experience was good. The item arrived per schedule and was an good condition. however, I found the same item at Costco for about $5 less. Wish they had price guarantee."
2,Starting to wear a little thin,"Okay, the first two seasons were great. But now, on the third, the constant fighting is not only exaggerated,but getting a little old. How many times is it funny to hear Frank wish Marie dead, or listen to Debra nag (I cringe whenever she starts that whiny voice) or to watch Marie, once again, favor Ray while poor Robert sits in a corner? It seems things alsolean more to the mean spirited side, and man oh man, it's just getting so not funny anymorethe whole 'Debra doesn't clean, Marie and Frank always barging in.' The jokes seem recycled. Don't know if I'll be buying anymore seasons after this."
5,It just keeps getting better.....,"For my third review of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND (for season three), I must mention that the humor just got sharper and sharper, and the writing better and better. This family-based show that showcased the ups and downs of the tightly-knit Barone family was especially funny here. I couldn't highlight the best of season three's antics without mentioning the (now legendary) episode where Ray's older brother, Robert (Brad Garrett) goes clubbing and starts to hang out with his partner from the police force, Judy (Sherri Shepherd). It goes to his head a little bit.....thus, donning the banana yellow suit. Okay, no more plot twists. Just check this episode, and all of the others out, for yourself. It's really one-of-a-kind."
5,Fun,How can you not laugh? We watched these DVD's while on lay-over at LAX and now apologize to everyone for how much we couldn't help but laugh out loud!
5,"Everybody Loves Raymond, Debra, Robert etc.","I wonder why people write a review criticizing a show that they don't like. The reviews are supposed to be for the DVD etc, not the show. I think that's terrible when people use this rating board to bash shows they don't like. If you don't like the show then don't buy the DVD.All in I love ""Raymond"" and will buy every season because I think it is a terrific, hilarious show."
2,An Unimpressive Presentation to a Good Argument,"While I may agree with the overarching principle of this book, I thought the presentation of the arguments and much of the evidence used was unconvincing. Clearly the authors have the idea of time spent verses outcomes produced right. If the book focused more on that, and perhaps on some other social issues, and along the way gathered more convincing evidence, I would have found it more appealing. For me, this book reads like the sour grapes of affluent parents who would much prefer to sip wine at the dinner table after a hard day at the office, or hit the slopes on vacation than help their children with simple and boring homework. And that's a shame."
2,Dangerous territory,"Although the research says there is solid evidence to prove that homework is more harmful than helpful, and I hold an Ed.D, I disagree totally with the premise of this book.How can you teach kids responsibility or good study habits when you don't give them any?If families feel that the policy of their particular school system needs work, they should get involved with school site councils and work on agreements with teachers and administrators. Everyone wins that way. Nothing is ever so one-sided that it can not be resolved to everyone's benefit."
4,very solid timba,i like this album a lot. i've had it a few weeks and it is really starting to grow on me. my favorite tracks are 11 and 12
2,Bad Buy,"Thought this shoe was attractive when I saw it online, but when I received it I wasn't pleased with the look at all. It doesn't fit comfortably across the top and so I haven't worn them at all."
2,Could do better.,"On first listening to this album my thoughts were - this is okay, but a bit bland. After several more listens, I think - nah, this is just bland.The backing tracks are good, the production superb - but there is just no melody here. Nothing grabs you at all. Nothing to play air-guitar too; nothing you'll be humming after listening to the CD. Its just Joe... well... musing along to some very well done backing tracks.Bland as it might be, it is a step in the right direction - and that's away from ""The Engines of Creation"". But as a new offering from the Guitar Idol Joe Satriani - it is pretty tame.So c'mon Joe! Give us another ""Surfing with the Alien"", ""Flying in a Blue Dream"" or ""The Extremist"". This was you at your best!"
2,SATCHES NEW SURFING FOR A NEW MILLENIUM,"I GOT THIS CD ABOUT 4 DAYS AGO HERE IN AUSTRALIA AND IT IS AWSOME.THERE IS A FAMILIAR SIDE TO THIS CD BUT ALSO A LOT OF GREAT TWISTS,SATCH KEEPS REINVENTING HIMSELF EVERY CD THAT COMES OUT.THIS HAS STAYED OWN MY CD PLAYER SINCE I GOT IT,THIS CD AND THE NEW TOTO CD ARE AWSOME.THE LAST SONG (CHANT SONG)AS SATCH SAYS IN THE LINER NOTES WILL BE INCREDIBLE LIVE AND WHEN YOU HEAR IT YOU WILL KMOW WHY?ANOTHER FANTASTIC CD FROM JOE,JUST BUY IT YOU WON,T BE DISAPOINTED."
5,A new galaxy of sound...,"That's where I feel Joe's music takes me when he composes like this. Great stuff, it's inspired,it moves me. Thank you Joe!"
5,Excellent!,"This is a great Satch album! Like with the last one, ""Is There Love In Space?"" Joe redeems himself for less entertaining past records. A good buy, and no disappointment."
5,$6.00! Don't pass this up!,"Satch doing what he does best. I only have three whole albums and about 40 songs I've bought seperately and I have yet to come across a ""bad"" one.Fantastic music - as always. A steal at $10!"
5,Super Guitarist,"Joe Satriani in his new ""Super Colossal"", proves again that he is one of the most influential rock guitarists of our age.He continues to define his sound developing further and further his distinct musical tunes.This is again a great CD from a great guitarist player; highly recommended."
3,not inspired or lazy???,"I bought today ""Super colossal"", and I must say that I am quite disappointed by its content; I have bought all Joe's albums since I discovered him with ""Surfing with the alien"", even bought some bootlegs... and I really would like to love this last album, but there is for me no surprise, everything is so predictible, on the safe side.So no big thrill for this time, only a nice soundtrack (with a great production, as usually!) for daydreaming or reading, but definitly not a masterpiece!Looking forward to the next one!"
3,Humble opinion,"TEN WORDS is the best music. But the album is a little bit boring. Satriani's technique, however, remains at peak form (or even better) than in his previous efforts"
5,Great experimental work,"Even listening to the 30 second previews on his website, I was looking forward to seeing what Joe had been working on lately. The first four songs are decent, all catchy in some way or another, but once you make it to track 5, things start to become really interesting. 'A Cool New Way' is hot, I like this cool new way, stick to it. Same feelings for 'Robots Dream' and 'Meaning of Love', two other great songs. My favorite track on the album is 'Made of Tears'. Could be classified as a 'perfect composition'. These are what I feel are the strongest tracks on the album. When you let Joe get experimental, you can really hear what it would be like to be in a room listening to him improvise for fun, it's great. I highly recommend this for any guitarist or person with a melodic ear."
3,its alright.,"im sorry to say this people. i am a huge fan of joe from the beginning. i dont see that it is necessary to beak down the cd track by track yet again. i fully understand the reviewers that rated super colossal not very high. joe is an incredible player. we all know that. that is not the issue. yeah the music is pleasant enough however i did not feel a wow factor that i expect when i buy a joe satriani cd. i hold joe in extremely high regard up there with the greatest rock guitarists ever. maybe im very picky but when i played the cd it didnt make me think that i will want to listen to this over and over. Sorry. i was psyched when i read all the 5 star reviews.****************************************its nice too see what huge fans joe has. i have every cd dvd and bootlegs, have seen him countless times since 87 and he blows me away every time. the cd simply bored me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,It's Joe who else?,Between A Cool New Way and One Robot's Dream this disc is great. I didn't like anything beyond Crystal Planet until now and I'm a huge Joe fan. Haven't missed him concert once. The music is a little different which is why I like it.
5,Very melodious. A master work!,"I own just about every Satriani album, and have yet to be disappointed by any. While Satch does have his own distinctives, I have found that every album has lots of originality. Super Colossal stands out for some of its beautiful yet hard-driving melodies."
4,Super Excellent,Actually 4.5 stars.I thought it was a bit uneven until about the third play. Maybe I was distracted a little during the first two plays. Maybe it was because I expected the title cut to be a knockout and instead it turned out to be a bit more subtle than that. This disc is a collection that hardcore Satch fans and newcomers can get into. It has the trademark sound but is pretty fresh at the same time. How does Joe keep writing so many great riffs?
2,Too much.,"This book had the potential to be an intriguing suspense however too many characters, too many subplots and an anticlimactic ending made it a disappointing read. I didn't count but I believe there were at least twenty characters introduced with a brief explanation of his/her history and at least three sub-plots.I found myself scanning the subplots to hurridly get to the main plot of murder and to the main characters of Sam, Caitlin, Dina and Frank only to lead to an ending that left too many unanswered questions and the reader,me, who lumbered through the 438 pages actually wanting to read more to get some satisfaction and closeure to the story. I found it too cumbersome to remember how everything and everyone related to the main story if in fact they did. If you enjoy stories within a story you may tolerate this. It wasn't my favorite. I am not however, going to let this one book, since this is the first I've read by this author, dissuade me from trying another by this author."
2,"I agree with L. Snyder, 'Sin' is more porno than romance","Thought it was only me. I put this book down without finishing it. I have read all of Gaelen Foley's books and although her love\sex scenes are 'hot', they have plot and interesting characters. This book was boring."
5,Bodice Ripper!,"I can call it a bodice ripper because right there on page 343 it says ""He tore her lovely bodice in his haste to get his hand on her..."" Hehe...The plot has been detailed elsewhere so I'll just say what I liked about this book. First the sex was really steamy and explicit. More, I think, than the other books in the series. These two were so hot for each other, right from the beginning. They couldn't keep their hands off each other!But the part I really liked was Alec's sweet seduction of Becky. He was such a pro. Standing under an awning on a rainy street, he said all those sweet words to her, just the right things to make her melt. And then he fed her and bathed her and kissed away her sorrows. Alec is so charming! What a sweet hero he is.These two had great chemistry. Maybe I was just in the right mood for it today, but I really loved this book."
4,One of the best in the series.,"This latest entry in this series is the best since The Duke and Lord of Fire. I must admit that every book since those first two has been a disappointment. Finally, One Night of Sin recaptures some of the originality and depth of those first two. I was surprised, but not upset, by what seemed like much more graphic sex and violence.My only criticism is that, from the very beginning, Alec seemed a little too self-aware. He demonstrated an emotional insight that was clearly 20th Century, from understanding how his mother's abandonment scarred him and affected his relationships with women, to being aware that his life lacked meaning and that saving Becky would help him regain his self-esteem. Not very credible. It would have been more interesting and satisfying for him to reach that understanding, with Becky's help, more slowly.Otherwise, a very entertaining read. I hope this signals that Ms. Foley is back on track!"
5,One Night of Sin...is pure Heaven!!!,"Having been a huge fan of Ms. Foley I was very familiar with Alec. Even though Alec has always been quite charming...he was also a bit of a failure. A total disappointment to his family. A compulsive gambler, broke, trying to maintain a facade of wealth by selling off his possessions and as this story opened we see that Alec has finally had enough of his destructive ways and that is when he meets Rebecca. A girl in trouble. The characters are complicated and multifacted...the prose is delightful. The story is taught and moves quickly. An excellent book."
3,Am I blushing?,"One Night of Sin is a reasonably enjoyable read. I liked the beginning, but found myself flipping pages towards the end, wishing they would wrap it up. Alec and Becky (not my favorite name for a heroine, but whatever) are both mostly likeable and, for the most part, well-rounded characters.Drawbacks: I would have enjoyed a little more involvement of the other Knight characters. More importantly, as some other reviewers have noted, the ""sex scenes"" in this book are almost sordid! I guess I prefer the Julia Quinn or Judith McNaught style of writing those scenes rather than the explicitness that is to be found in Ms. Foley's books. If nothing else, it certainly wakes you up!I will probably stick around for Jack's story but I may be donating this one to my local library."
3,Yawn,"I generally love a good adventure, damsel in distress, etc. but this book was downright silly. The issue of the fiendish uncle is never really developed, simpy a concept out there that explains why this woman ends up asleep on the heros doorstep. Without a properly developed fiend, I had a really hard time getting into the damsel needing saving theme. Your money is better spent on another author."
3,Not up to standard,"No need to cover the plot, other reviews have made that unnecessary. I've loved all of Ms Foley's previous books and couldn't wait to open this one. What a disappointment! Alec and Becky were totally unreal. I didn't find Alec at all sexy and Becky was too sacharine for words. The Russian prince was such a caricature that I kept expecting him to be an imposter. The plot was unlikely and I have to agree with the other reviewer who likened this book to those Stephanie Laurens now writes. Explicit sex on every other page ---yawn!! If you skip over the sex there's not much book left."
1,AutoMeter - FAIL!!!,"If I could leave zero stars I would. Ordered this clock. First one came and the knob was broken off the stem. Returned it to Amazon - perfect performance by them. They replaced it with a new one the next day. Second one came, I hooked it up and it was working fine. Then I put in the illumination light and it caused the second hand to stop/jam against the clock stem where you set the thing. Remove the light - it works. Put the light in - it jams. Amazon had been so good about the first one that I sent an e-mail to AutoMeter to see if they had a fix. Yeah they had a fix alright: Fill out a form, pay $10 and shipping. Then they would fix it. Tried to explain that this was their issue and not mine, it was a new clock and the response was fill out the form, pay $10 and ship it. So thank God Amazon has a great return policy so they can give this junk back to AutoMeter. I am going to find a different clock from a different company."
3,Not Your Father's Oldsmobile,"I am a casual user of MS FrontPage. I do believe in upgrading my software as new versions become available. So I purchased the upgrade version of MS Expression. It is not anything like FrontPage. It was designed for a full time web designer and not for a casual user. You had better have a technical dictionary available as neither the software or the accompanying instruction cd tell you what all the acronyms mean. When I finally figured out some of the jargon and was able to create a couple of web pages, it was not WYSIWYG. This is going to take some time to get used to. If you are a casual web author and going to buy this product be prepared to do some serious homework."
3,Expression Web,"The product installed easily, upgrading from my previously installed FrontPage. This new program is feature packed and seems to handle CSS and ASP well. From what I have seen so far, everything is XHTML compliant.My real heartburn with this product is lack of documentation. Microsoft has always been week on documentation but I think this is a new low. A good user manual, even if it were on disc, would have gone far in my rating this higher.I think people who have not worked in FrontPage and even some who have, will struggle trying to use any but the basic features."
1,Hate it - Skip Expression Web,Hate this program and am shopping around for something to replace it with. I'm not sure why Microsoft had to scrap Frontpage instead of working with what they had and upgrading. I had developed a website design business around that software package in spite of its limitations - and there were definitely some limitations. I will not recommend this product to anyone and I will be converting all of my client websites to a different program... in the meantime they will be maintained in Frontpage while I shop around.
4,great value,"I use this stand a lot and I really like it...it ain't a Park, but it is fully adjustable, very stable, and pretty tough...great value for the $."
4,Kaiser/Oswald,"Before this disc, I wasn't aware of Mr. Plunderphonics' free improvisation skills. I bought it mainly out of curiosity, and being on the Incus label is always a sufficient recommendation. Oswald can certainly play, and Kaiser is a legend by now, but I don't find myself returning to this outing much. Still, it's recommendable. You don't need to look very far though, for a better sax/guitar improv record. Check out Stefan Jaworzyn & Alan Wilkinson's rather brutal In A Sentimental Mood, also on Incus. It sounds loud even at low volumes, and would probably make Oswald and Kaiser run for the hills. Wilkinson often plays sax in a trio with Simon Fell and Paul Hession, and some of you will remember Jaworzyn from early Skullflower records (he's now part of Ascension)."
3,"Sweet story, but same old same old!!","It was an enjoyable book, but would not be on the top of my list. It was better than some of todays novels."
3,City boy survives summer camp,"""City Boy"" is an affectionate look at a bright kid growing up in the Thirties in NYC. It's not one of Wouk's best, but it does have charm as it follows Herbie Bookbinder from city to summer camp as he endures adolescence and embarks on a path to maturity. Although it's been compared to Tom Sawyer, it really is a coming of age story set in an urban context. If that was your context when you were a teenager, this book's for you."
3,Book review,"This book is ok, but I didn't enjoy reading it as much as I thought I would. I ordered it because I like stories based on truth, and I think this one basically is, but it just didn't really appeal to me. It's a story of a little fat boy growing up in the city and his experiences with teachers, classmates and family and neighbors. Try a sample reading before you invest and if you like that, you may like the book. I'm sure there are others out there who like it. I just couldn't get into it."
3,Odd But Powerful Juxtapositions,"I decided to buy this album because a friend linked ""Third Eye"" (the opener) on his Facebook page. A powerfully strange intersection of Dream Theater and Primus, with a dash of Frank Zappa thrown in."
3,Decent but not what I'd prefer,"I was in a cd shop one day and I just randomly happened to catch a glance of Short Wave on a Cold Day. I purchased it and was immediately taken in by the esoteric and occasionally random language and relaxed but still thoughtful musical style. So of course I bought their first album. I was completely surprised by the immense difference in musical styles between the two albums. Where Short Wave was quietly thoughtful and less assuming, Songs for Insects was far more aggressive and, too a degree, not produced as well. The sound was choppy and occasionally sounded like a bad live performance. The lyrics still stand strong and the random shifts in time signatures and vocal inflections can be seen, but I guess I am just not a fan of original Thought Industry. If you are ok with a less produced sound, then by all means don't miss out on this album because, if you can ignore its faults, it is a great album."
4,Weird...,"I was given this CD being told it was Death Metal, which I am an avid fan of. Well, it wasn't death metal, but it was something very different. Its thrash/punk/progressive rock,- it's weird. The songs are quirky and frantic, as in time changes are very abundant. It's an interesting listen and definitley weorth your time, I suppose."
1,Beware!,I love Don Cherry. This is a 1960's collaboration with computer music of the most primitive sort. It's unlistenable. Maybe OK for those interested in early computer music. It is interesting as yet another side of the ever-questing Cherry.
4,Excellent for beginners,Sara does a great job of introducing Yoga to you. She takes her time to show you everything a couple of times before you hold for the 6 breaths. The only bad thing about the video is that once you learn everything it gets kinda annoying to keep having to hear her go over everything each time you use the video. Also the popups can be distracting when your concentrating. Overall great for beginners!
3,SSSSLLLLOOOWWWWWWW,"It's not bad in terms of the moves you have to do, quite a workout but the tape drove me nuts because it went so slowly. I am sure this will be an advantage to some as it also explains well, however, I couldn't do it more than once because i just didn't have the patience"
5,AweSome Video,This video is certainly for beginners. It takes you step by step through the basics of yoga in simple and precise explanations. It gets you off to right start in Yoga. I have played this tape numerous times and I continue to play it as it is an enjoyable workout.
2,Annoying,"The instructions are clear and thorough, but of the 55 minutes only about 25-30 seem to be postures. The rest is explanation. That's fine to learn, but becomes annoying when you want to just do the workout. Also, the whole ""X for Dummies"" motif includes tips, jargon, and other points. The problem is that they pop this stuff up while you are doing the postures and use annoying sounds to get your attention. I could not achieve any serenity or maintain concentration, which is kinda the point of yoga. I used it a couple times and then went to another tape. The book was better."
1,why so much???????????,"My wife and I love this dvd. We have taken classes in the past and this dvd is a nice alternative to leaving the house when kids won't let us. We had previously borrowed it from my mother in law and decided to purchase our own. However in searching amazon, we found the dvd listed at well over $40. ???????? When looking at other websites this dvd is priced at $10-$12. I was just wondering if the case was made of gold or if it came with a real life yoga instructor? Waiting for price to be altered or will be purchasing from somewhere else as well as my future business."
2,Do Not Purchase this Tape,"BORING. Too Basic. Dumb Sound effects and animation. if you do not like the ""for dummies"" books, you definately won't like this tape. the instructor is good. but the format for a workout is terrible."
1,Do you need instructions on standing up?,"I bought Pilates for dummies and found the level very appropriate to someone who exercise regularly, but is new to a specific type of exercies. The Yoga for Dummies tape was so basic it gives you instructions on how to stand up. The workout was too simple even for someone who has just practiced yoga half a dozen dimes. I would not recommend this tape to anyone"
3,LONG and lots of Commentary -- but good descriptions,"I am just starting out yoga. I'm new at the breathing, the asanas, etc... so I thought this may be a great dvd to watch the first time, then try the second time. I rented it through the local library, so I knew even if it didn't work out for me, I didn't spend any money to buy ((great idea if you have a local library that rents these dvds)). I really liked the explanations, etc...but as others mentioned, doing it with the dvd is excruciatingly painful -- it's just too much talking...and too long. So the good thing about the dvd is you can skip to certain poses yourself to remember what it is that you are supposed to do, but other than that...ugh...I would recommend ONLY if it can be rented, not purchased!!"
4,very basic but useful for beginners,"As an intro to yoga this is a useful tape for beginners, which is exactly what it claims to be. After the first time you kind of wish you could put it into fast-speed mode, especially for reasonably fit people. It is not a workout, but it is a nice addition to a good workout as a cooldown (or a warmup), or if you have no energy today and want something real easy. After doing it a few times you get the inclination to just write the titles of the positions down, put on your own music, and do them in your own tempo. However since the tape claims to be a very basic introduction I still give it 4 stars."
3,"Gives the Tiny Details, but Lacking in Routine","This tape is -- as everyone else has mentioned -- a good tape for the beginner. What also needs to be mentioned is that it is a technical tape. Not technical as in jargony and difficult to understand, but that it gives the details of how to do and not to do a pose. The upside to this is that it explains to beginners the poses. The downside is there really isn't any flow, so the tape isn't meant to be used for daily practice. It should be seen of as an adjunct and complement to your daily yoga tape, not your routine. A book could fill these shoes just as easily, and there are lots of excellent books out there. Try something by Rodney Yee for beginners instead."
4,Easy to follow and saferthan the others,As a fitness trainer I worry about my clients jumping into yoga. Most beginners land up on their necks without the corrrect instruction. I recommned this video for a beginner--and have used it myself.
4,Great for beginners,"This is an excellent DVD to get you started in the basics of yoga. It shows you each pose in detail so you can do it correctly and not injure yourself. The only downside is that once you master it, you need another program to move on. But if you're just learning it's the way to go."
3,really basic,"Having never done yoga before I was pleased with the level of description and thought that went into this DVD. It certainly gave me a basic understanding of yoga. That said, having worked through the basic routine five times I find working to the DVD really annoying as it doubles the time the exercises should take and I find myself doing it on my own. Yet to try the intermediate level yet though. Bottom line is: if you've not done yoga before then this is great but don't expect to be pulling it off the shelf every day."
3,"Good explanations, easy to follow","I was hunting for yoga DVDs for persons with various disabilities, for older, fatter people, for people with knee problems, that sort of thing. This DVD is not advertised to be that DVD but I was able to do most of the poses. In it the instruction goes through 12 yoga poses. She emphasizes you can do all or one or a few, your choice. Her explanations are excellent and she offers occasional suggestions if you find them difficult. It wasn't exactly what I needed but I can see working it into my regular routine as one option, adjusting as needed."
5,Yoga for Dummies,"I tried a yoga class a couple of years ago and didn't like it. I thought it was just sitting in uncomfortable positions for as long as you could stand it. With this DVD, I've learned to love it. In just a few weeks of doing the workout every other day I can see improvement. I find myself looking forward to my yoga time. I'm alternating it with the Pilates for Dummies workout which is a great combination for me - someone who hates to workout but knows the health benefits."
4,No complaints!,Everything was as it was described. I'm happy with the condition it arrived in and it seems like a great video.
3,"Easy, Simple, Fun","This is a great selection for those who are beginners. The host is fun, easy to follow, and very nice in personality. You won't be left behind or in the dark. She explains everything and you will know what you're doing before you begin. Very relaxing."
4,great for beginners,"I rented the video at my local public library, and I liked it and the instructor enough to buy the DVD. Sara Ivanhoe is very likeable, and does not condescend to those of us just starting out with the yoga thing. However, after I watched it a few times, I no longer needed all of the exhaustive instructions. I wish the DVD also had a version of the basic workout without the instructions. The bonus beginning-intermediate workout on the DVD is a nice addition.I learned a lot from this DVD - I just hope I never get caught doing my forward bends in my cubicle at work!"
2,Annoying & Unrelaxing,"Don't buy this DVD unless you can stand annoying sounds & images popping up on the screen while you're working out. I like the Dummy books & their icons, but the icons do not belong on a DVD. If you want yoga for relaxation, this is not the DVD for you!"
2,Maybe better for just viewing,"The constant instruction during the moves was irritating. There was a good bit of talking. I was more tense after my session than before I started. For a beginner who just wants to see the moves and study correct position, maybe this is helpful. Personally, it made me so hyper-aware of form, I couldn't concentrate on relaxing."
3,Basic Yogas for Dummies,The instructions were simple but there were many positions to learn and that made it difficult for beginners to understand and follow.
4,Great Yoga workout,"Great introduction to Yoga. Not very intense but tries to give the viewer a sense of the feel of the postures. And lets face it, this particular Yogi makes for great eye candy. You'll see what I mean if you watch the workout. :)"
3,OK DVD - Yoga is not for me,"I tried this DVD because I hear so much about yoga and I wanted to try it. It was definitely a good instruction video and stuck to it's name of being ""For Dummies"". If you've done yoga before and are looking for a new workout - don't do this one. It would even get pretty old after doing it a few times as a beginner. I would definitely rent it as an introduction to yoga and if you like it, buy a better yoga DVD. As for me - I discovered I just don't care for yoga. So even though the instruction is good and it is very basic for dummies like me, I just plain didn't care for yoga."
4,This is great for the REAL beginner,"So many videos and books say for the beginner. But, they really require some previous experience and a lot of coordination. This one treats you like an adult but takes things slow. You are able to perform almost all of the positions on your first try. Maybe in the modified way but still doing them. I have three children and had back surgery 3 years ago- so this is something to be able to get through the whole tape. The guide speaks in a relaxing tone and shows even the smallest steps."
3,"Ummm... Dummies.. No, VERY beginner? YES","This is a great addtion to the beginners library of yoga... however, after you've watched it more than 2 or 3 times you're going to be ready for something new. The teacher does an excellent job discribing the postures, however this may become TOO much once you're ready to start flowing in your postures. Being able to choose from the chapters what postures you want to work on at any given time is a great also. ASIN:B001DDY6RG TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION]]"
4,Another great workout video,I lack flexibility and this video was a great buy. It's a great video for beginners. I've improved my flexibility and I feel peaceful and serene. The instructor isn't annnoying at all; in fact she really helps make the inner peace come out. Great video.
3,"Good for beginners, but you'll get bored quickly","I am new to Yoga and found this DVD extremely useful. It takes time to explain each detail of the posture. I would purchase this video to learn the correcy way to do basic postures, but I would NOT rely on it to be your sole workout. Once you do it a few times the explanation between each gets a little old."
5,Great for Beginners,"If you're thinking of taking up yoga, this video is a good place to start. It's easy to understand. The instructor takes the time to thoroughly explain each of the poses and stretches. The exercises are great. I've found that I have more energy since I started using the video. It also shows moderations on the exercises for those who are less flexible. The video does move extremely slow, however. If you're already in pretty good shape, you will probably want to find a video that's a little more challenging than this one. But if you're looking for something that goes slowly with exercises that work but aren't too strenuous, then this is the video to buy."
3,A good entry to Yoga,"I found this tape was a nice introduction since I've never done yoga before. However, the instruction was so detailed, I found myself standing or holding a pose waiting while she talked a little too much, on things that could have been talked about before you start holding the pose. It would also have been better if at the end of the instructional part of the workout, there could have been a routine with just the poses and relaxtion without all in the introduction and instruction. I find it hard to put in a 50 minute tape every day and listen to the ""basics"" again and again. I want a short 15-20 minute workout, which it could be once your familar with it. Overall a nice entry to yoga."
1,A Simpleton's Primer,"If the author intended to create a book for pre-adolescents, he did a good job. This book is useless for anyone else. Go buy A Breed Apart which is visually and textually superior to this simplistic look at sports' most challenging position."
2,False description,Not what I ordered. It was described AND pictured as having a handle. It arrived... NO HANDLE. It is not a mess tin its a storage box. Good quality Aluminum you will need to take a file to the edges though as they are very sharp !!! Couldn't even be bothered to send it back. Its a miscellaneous screws and nails bin in my garage! Here is their link... http://www.amazon.com/Trangia-327567-P-Mess-Aluminium-Tin/dp/images/B008YW70EK/ref=dp_image_x_0?ie=UTF8&color;_name=x&img;=0&s;=sporting-goodsI see a HANDLE !
3,Not as pictured!,Great product if you want the one without the handle. The product description at the time of purchase was not there. So i went off of the picture. I received the version without the handle. So be cautious when ordering.
3,Canadian Nuclear Arsenal,"This book describes the US/Canadian cooperation in deploying nuclear weapons to various Canadian bases. The material presented ranged from policy issues down to images of weapon control panels. There is something for everyone who is interested in this subject. Some of the mundane messages, technical order pages included would be of interest only to the serious reader. If you are looking for a cursory history nuclear weapons in Canada, skim the book, if you want minute details, this book has it. I am glad I have this book and it covers a time and places that I haven't seen in any other book."
3,It wasn't what I expected,"I had assumed that the sign movements would be shown, not just done with the song; I'm not that advanced to learn just by them doing it; and, it's backwards when you're trying to learn it from watching the DVD. I need instruction with it; and, I didn't review it before I ordered to see that there was no instructions."
1,A Disappointment,"After the excellent 'Beauty Myth', I found this book to be a great disappointment. It may be useful for those women who have college degrees and now want to break the glass ceiling in the high powered business world, but it has nothing to say to those of us who are still trying to get access to equal pay and decent jobs. Wolf is a white middle class American and it shows - she can talk to other women like herself, but in this book she has absolutely nothing to say to the rest of us. Susan Faludi's book 'Backlash' is far more worthwhile for addressing issues that matter to the majority of women."
1,Randal Terry proxy,"Wolf's religious conversion to the anti-choice cult winning citations from Priests for life among other seedy sources makes her a good candidate for sermonizing at a Promise Keeper rally. Wolf is a charlatan, whose moral dictates are cheap and limited to mystics. The pulpy format of this paperback compliments it's content."
3,PCI-to-PCIe bridge nightmare,"The PCI-bus version of this card (not the AGP or the PICe) has a very interesting technical challenge.This card implements a PCI-to-PCI bridge on the board, and, this messes-up a lot of machines.Normally bridges are on the motherboard, and the BIOS of the motherboard advertises them in the ACPI table.Since the bridge comes as part of PnP discovery, the resource arbiter must be able to find bus address space for the bridge and the card.This can be challenging, because BIOS out there are full of bugs, and, the resource abiter must trust the BIOS before the BUS.The bottom line is: you may not even see the card coming up in device manager, and, you might need to disable other PCI devices to get this to work.Dell machines are particularly bad on this.On my HP xw4200 i got to work by removing a 1694 adapter, and by disabling the Memory Setup in the arbiter"
4,"Coming of age, an 80's perspective","The film was good. It was dark at times and reflected aspects that do not reflect in a good light, the preditory nature of some members of the Gay life. It didn't strike me as the typical feel good movie, in fact, it didn't feel good through a few scenes at all.I like the film however, if you are looking for some light entertainment, this would not fit the bill. If your looking for hard reality and depth of emotion, this will do the trick.""No pun intended"""
3,"Not great, but alright","Many times watching this movie, I got very bored. It's not the most compelling movie.But there are strong points. First off, what a great job portraying the '80s. It really felt, looked, and sounded like the 80's in this movie. It was very nostalgiac-looking. Second, Eric's relationships with his parents are probably more compelling than anything else in the movie. His mother was wonderfully loving. The scenes with his parents oozed with realism. I also think the movie did a very good job of portraying the alienation of adolescence, the confusion of coming out of the closet, learning you are gay. The acting is also high quality.This isn't a great movie, but it's worth seeing."
3,Misleading Cover - Disturbing Movie,"This film was alot heavier than I expected. The cotton candy cover led me to believe that it was a ""fun"" and funny film. It's alot grittier and seamier than I expected.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but it starts off nicely and then turns into a drunken slutfest! (Get your finger off that ""Buy Now"" Button girlfriend! You KNOW who you are.)I was SO afraid for this young man (Johnny Jailbait). I wanted someone to give him the ""The Birds Sing For You Too"" speech. Instead, they just hand him another beer. Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Where's the joy? Where's the love?? Where's the humanity???"
2,"too far, too fast, too forced","I was surprised to find myself disliking this video. It appears to have everything necessary to make it a great film. The problem appears to stem from the producer's desire to include every cliche concerning the gay world. The inclusion of some scenes seemed forced and awkward. It fails uterly as a love story, miserably as a coming out diary, and completely as an aide to youth coming to terms with life."
1,REALLY BAD MOVIE :(,The trailer tricks you into thinking its a up-lifting romance but its not. The main character (Eric) is really hot but very self-centered. I can understand his distress but thats no excuse to ignore others feelings. And the ending seemed tacked on as a after thought. Not worth buying. :P
4,Don't Believe the Critics,"Many critics felt this film was cliched. But tell that to the mostly gay audience at the SF Gay and Lesbian Film Festival a couple of years ago when this film received a 5 minute ovation after its screening. For a straight reviewer it may be cliched, but for anyone who came out in the 70's it is a must see if for nothing else than a great Bronski Beat soundtrack and the performance of Lea DeLaria.If you liked Parting Glances or Get Real... get this film!"
4,The Gay '80s,"Anybody who came out and lived through the 80's will find much to love in this movie. Moving, Funny, Sad. A gay version of a John Hughes film .... and if that isn't 80's I don't know what is. I remember those days fondly - but when I see the visuals - wow do the clothes scare me! Soundtrack is perfect."
2,Didn't Get It,"What was the point of the movie? What was it trying to say? If it was trying to say coming out is difficult and self-denial is harmful, then it did a good job. Other than that, there's nothing worthy here. As a reviewer has said, no one but the protagonist's mom is likeable. So true..."
2,Very good acting but utterly mundane plot,"I agree with a previous reviewer who wondered what the point of this film is. Aside from watching an extremely handsome kid turn himself into a Boy George wannabe, and several cliche scenes that have been repeated either in the exact same way or much better in 1000 other films, there's nothing left. Worth a rental in my view, not a purchase. Or at least Strand needs to seriously rethink their pricing for this film.With that said, the acting is excellent all around, especially Chris Stafford who made the most out of a truly mundane script."
2,Eh,"Bland, bland, and more bland.It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark. With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable. And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity."
5,Art History Book,"It was in perfect condition. But besides that I just needed it for class, so my teacher picked it out. not a bad book i guess."
4,Excellent Source for Specialized Art Books,"I was very happy to find Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics, on Amazon. I obtained a used copy, in good condition, at a very reasonable price, and received it very quickly also. I have found that Amazon is a very good place to find offbeat and specialized or technical books, and especially to be able to obtain gently used copies at very good prices. I do wish the shipping cost less, however."
5,The Crimson Mask,"My wife and I saw The Crimson Mask at the Louisville International Festival of Film and loved it. A fresh take on the Noir film that gives the viewer hints of old and new style filmmaking. With twists and turns in the story that will keep you entertained and waiting to find out what happens in the end. My wife and I both agree, The Crimson Mask is a good film by a great young filmmaker."
1,me no likey..,The sole separated from leather of the boot. My beautiful boots are now worthless. Plain and simple..
2,DANGEROUS PRODUCT,"This shock will not work in chrysler van even they claim it fit, it will fit but not functioning, the van will bottom out so easely, creating very dangerous situation, I bought my long ago and just put it in last month, will take it out and replace it with different brand, will sue them if have money, very irresponsible company to put out something that don't fit and don't perform."
4,Great pad. more sizes please,"I ordered this for a child's toboggan. A bit short, but it insulates well and does the job if the child isn't too active. Will need one a foot longer next year and then use this in the sled."
4,Recipes are accurate and well written;results are good.,The recipes in this book are true to the foods I grew up on. Using the recipes as written will produce good results. Mrs. Noriega has avoided (thankfully) sensationalizing the recipes.
3,Ok for reference but limited,"Married to a Filipino, I use this book often but only as a guide for the ingredients. If I follow the recipe's exactly, it's always a bit different than my mother in law's cooking. Most recipes must be adjusted to taste and sometimes still come out bland. Nevertheless, of the 4 Filipino cookbooks we have, this one gets used 2-3x per week."
3,Good recipes- some not authentic,"I am married to a Filipino and have been for 19 yrs- I bought this book several years ago so I could cook some of his favorite foods, the pancit canton recipe and adobo recipes are awesome, the maja blanca is ok I learned through other filipina's little tricks to make better- the beef steak recipe is a big disappointment nothing near my mom n laws awesome beef steak with onions- overall the book is good easy to find ingredients and easy to read and follow"
5,All the flavors I grew up with.,"I was delighted to find this cookbook! It contains recipes for all my favorite foods that Mom served our family as I was growing up, as well as all the standard fare found at every Filipino 'party' or special family gathering. Philippine Recipes Made Easy by Violeta A. Noriega allows me to recreate in my own kitchen, the aromas and flavors that were so much a part of our family traditions and togetherness. The recipies are easy to follow and all of the ingredients were found with ease at local markets and oriental grocery stores. It's the most used cookbook in my kitchen."
4,Masarap,"Since my parents moved out of state, I had to fend for myself when it comes to Filipino food. This is like Filipino Cooking for Dummies!"
5,Memories,My daughter and I share a birthday next month - I will be 40 and she will be 8. I bought this set of books for her but I know I will be rereading them as well...I loved these books when I was a kid and I can't wait to share them with her.
3,This takes MAGIC to a whole new meaning!,"This book half magic is about 4 siblings with a very boring dull life. Especially ever sense there dad died, it's up to their mom to raise them. So that makes their life even more boring. But this summer was going to make them see things in a whole new way.This book is funny interesting easy book to pick up and read and a hard book to put down. I loved Half Magic because it was an enjoyable book and it is worth while!"
3,Some are not sturdy enough,"I have a german shepherd who has this listed as her absolute favorite ball. I used to get them at our local pet store, but they have since stopped stocking it. In general, these balls last a few months, with heavy use. So, I thought I would stock up on three of them since I have to order online now. The first ball barely lasted half a day before it was shredded (it felt thinner than the other two). The second ball lasted about a week. I've not brought out the third ball yet because for this price, I can't replace them every week. Not sure if the product was older (maybe sitting on a shelf for a while) or just substandard material. I may need to find her another new favorite if the third one lasts a week or less. Time will tell."
3,Not as Durable as my old one,"I bought this for my dog after finding one in a stream that we walked a lot.It is her favorite toy. The older one is much more durable, soft and chewy.This one was much less resistant to my dog's tough love. Still her favorite,it just will not last as long."
4,Fact checking,"After reading the book I found it entertianing and over all very informative with excellent coverage of the early British Blues scene. Not to lay too much stress on this one item but towards the end of the book when Cream are wrapping up their final American performances he lists the seating capacity of New Yorks Madison Square Garden at 220,000 seats. This is absolutely wrong and certainly not a typo. South American soccer stadiums don't have this capacity. To me when I read a simple fact like this that's so glaring incorrect I start to wonder about the other ""facts"" presented in the book. The Amazon blurb about the ""hedonistic lifestyle"" is out of place. While I'm sure there were incindences of this kind the author doesn't stoop to the level of some rock writers tabloid mentality. Well worth reading, but listen to the music first."
4,Recommended for children and teenagers,"I bought this book because I was looking for something to tell me how some Saints lived their lives - something inspirational. This it did, in it's way. It provides a brief, but personal, summary of the lives of 21 famous and not-so-famous saints. However, it appears to have been written with a children to teenage audience in mind, and so was a bit simplistic for me, as an adult, in places. By the same token, for me, as a non-Catholic, the book was easy to understand and provided useful and thought-provoking insights into sainthood and Catholic beliefs. I would recommend this book mainly to an early-teen audience, but it can also provide a good introduction to sainthood and Catholic beliefs to people of all ages and religious persuasions."
1,Totally fake ad,"This product was advertised, as a set of 10 disks, but when I opened the package, there was only part 3 with two disks only. What a scam!"
4,very weird punk with good rap verses,"I bought this album along time ago and lost it. (doh) But thanks to you guys at amazon i`ll be ordering it in a few moments when i`ve finished this review,..... anyway eventhough this is very old, get it, as you wont find this sort of thing anymore,.... it`s got some great technical stuff in there and is very fast."
1,3 Words: Denture Cleaning Tablets,You can get a large box of them for a few bucks at your local Walmart. Much more cost effective.
5,Great product,"I have the Armorbak, and needed to clean it after a few uses. It took about 5 minutes of your time to do it. Really simple.. rinse it out, fill with water, stick tablets in it, and come back to rinse it out. It cleans the bladder perfectly, and has no after taste."
2,Will not clean heavy algae from tube.,"My Omega bladder never really gets ""funky""; however, the tube usually gets algae in it from continued use. After trying bleach, I decided to get the official Cleaning Tabs along with the brush set. Initially, I tried one tab in the recomended amount of water for five minutes (recommended time), but the only result was the water turned slightly blue. So, I waited about an hour and used the tube brush, but nothing happened. At that point, I put in another cleaning tablet and waited overnight. Again I used the tube brush and still no affect. Granted my tube had some tough algae which had been in there for a while, but I expected some of it to be removed. This product probably works okay as a maintenance protocol, but if your tube has not been really cleaned in a season or two you may just want to order a new tube instead."
3,Best Cleaning Tablet for Camelbak!!!,There are the best cleaning tablet available for Camelbak products. Especially for the ones with hard to reach areas to clean manually.
4,Camelbak cleaning tabs,Product works great. Recommend it to anyone wanting to keep their camelbak clean and sanitary.Thanks for the quick shipment.
5,Drop it in and rinse,"These tablets make it very easy to disinfect your Camelbak reservoir. Put 1 L of water in, drop the tab in, close it up and rinse it around and let it set. Empty, rinse, and fill or dry. Easy!"
4,Hoppy: The Greatest of All Western Series,"The Hopalong Cassidy series has always been my favorite Saturday afternoon matinee shoot-em-up. The video and audio quality on these discs is on a par with the earlier-released Image discs. My only complaint with the extemely attractive package is with the method that has been employed to secure the content list to the tin. Rather than using glue dots which are easily liftable so that the list may be removed and stored inside the tin, the list is rather securely glued to the tin. It has to be literally ripped from the tin. This can be done without damaging Hoppy's image on the tin, but the content list winds up as toast."
2,Boring,I tried the entire DVD from start to finish before deciding that it was extremely BORING! I lost interest and never want to try it again.
4,namaste2u,"Great tape, very informative. I like all of the dummie products, you feel like you are getting the correct information for your situation. I have dummie books and another tape. Would buy again."
2,Too Slow,"I felt like I spent more time listening then working out! If you have any knowledge of stregnth training (squats, lunges, crunches) then this video is not for you!"
1,Has soooo much potential...,"I think this tape has a lot of potential as the instructions are good and clear. Unfortunately once you have watched it 2 or 3 times the insturctions and demo's seem to take forever and become very annoying and you then realize why the title ""For Dummies"". What would have been perfect is if they had the instructionals and then at the end maybe had a section where she just ran thru the sets w/o all the instructions as you would do them in a normal routine and then you could skip to that, or put it at the beginning. This video is only good for maybe 4 or 5 workouts, after that it is way tooooo time consuming for 12 exercises (45 minutes)."
3,Too Slow,Too much wait-time between exercises while the exercises are being explained. Way too slow for me.
5,Straightforward and Thorough,Great basic weight exercises for those of us who like to follow an instructor from the comfort of our own home!
4,Weight Training for Gentle Rehabilitation,"Having waited several years for permission from my doctor to work my upper body, this DVD was an excellent beginning. I was a strong walker, but the lower body exercises (without dumbbells as your own weight is enough to start with) gave me a pleasant burn. I was very pleased with the slow pace of the video, and the perfect form of the instructor. I began with 1-pound weights to get my muscles used to the movement, then cautiously increased to 2-pound weights. I could feel the weight yet be comfortable that I was safely building a foundation.So if you're really out of shape, I encourage you to start with this DVD. After you have mastered the form and developed some strength, then look for more challenge."
4,Good introduction,"Great for learning basic weights that can be done easily in your living room. The instructor really explains how to do each exercise safely and most effectively, with modifications. The only complaint I have is that once you're familiar with it, you have to fastforward through the lengthy explanations. Maybe there needs to be a follow-up that's faster paced for more experienced users!"
4,Shaping up With Weights for Dummies,I've been using this for a coupleof weeks and think I am getting some type of benefit from this program. My only complaint is that I would have preferred to have the introductions to the exercises entered as seperate cahpters so they are easier to skip once the viewer understands those parts.
4,Shaping up w/weights for Dummies,This was an excellent exercise disc. It was so much easier to exercise along with someone ( Tracy York) as the time flies by. Anyone can do these steps and it is a very thorough workout with exercises for every part of the body ( if you chose). 35 minutes is all I do. You can go further and there are tips to make it harder or easier to do them. I recommend it highly.
3,Slow workout,I agree with Ali in this is a good basic instruction dvd but I don't use it anymore either. You want to spend your time wisely working out and this just wastes valuable time. If you are a beginner and need to know how to do a weight lifting exercise correctly this is useful but after you get the basics down you will not use this dvd anymore.
4,Love 'em,"I put two of these in a Q logic box under the back seat of my 2002 Tundra access cab. Going from two Kicker C-12's in a 4 CUFT bandpass box I was not expecting a huge amount of bass.... boy was I wrong.. these little subs rock.On a side note, I did rip the surround off the cone the other day.... glues it back with a flexible adhesive and the sub is still beating away! I am probably feeding them around 200 Watts RMS and they take it in stride."
5,Great sub,"I have one of these in a sealed box under that back seat of my F150 and it sounds great. It plays very loud and low for an 8"" and it only needs a .3 cubic ft sealed box. has great cone excursion. It plays very clear and tight. Double bass sounds very good. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone that wants good bass in a small spot."
5,great woof,this woofer is a great item and bargain!!!!! thumps and bumps with the best and quality is supurb. buy buy buy
3,"ok little subwoofer, but ive heard better","I bought this subwoofer planning to replace my stock 8 inch subwoofer in my cars factory location. I decided to leave the car alone, but instead i wanted to test it to see what it could do so I connected it to use in my house. I used two amps a zapco 220wrms amplifier and a ppi 400wrms amplifier. the subwoofer flexed pretty good but there was no tone at some points, it was just flexing and pushing air but there was no sound produced when it flexed, and it flexed pretty hard. I was probably pushing it to its limits and the sub was probably at its max excursion levels when i tested it. Maybe it was just the box i used or maybe because it was in my house, but afterwards I hooked up 2 twelves and it sounded much better.pros- cheap price, good flex, durable could probably take 500wrms with a good ampcons- a whole lot of air with no sound at some points"
4,sub is good,"i only have it powered by a 75w JBL amp, in a ported box. it doesnt POUNDS like a mother,, but it will give you enough bass for a limited space,,,,but if you only have 1 of them for your sedan .... your back seat will block all the sound,,, and you wont hear anything,,,for a hatchback car, this is not bad..."
3,Better than nothing,"I needed a little extra bass in my Jeep and that's just what I got. A LITTLE extra bass. Good product for the money but if you're wanting a lot of bass, this is not for you. I would only suggest this to replace a factory 8"" sub."
3,BBB sunglasses,"Purchased my first pair of BBB sunglasses in France and loved the blue mirrored lenses. Bent down and the glasses fell from my head and landed smack on the lens, scratching the line of sight. I ordered these hoping that I was replacing the same pair but the blue lens are not mirrored like my other pair and are not as dark. The style is still great for sports - wrap around and vented for anti-fogging. Fit well and received the pair promptly and in great condition. Vendor was great."
2,"Looks great, hurts the feet.","The sole of this shoe (at least the pair I got) does not support the foot under the toes - when walking it feels like the toes are actually lower than the ball of the foot. I didn't think much of it until I wore them for a whole day, after which my feet hurt for several days."
4,Vance & Hines fuel pack,"Excellent installation directions, easy to follow. Unit is a tight fit on FXD lowriders. You need to make sure your control module is set back to factory settings to use this unit."
2,My least favorite Wodehouse....,"I've read and enjoyed 20+ Wodehouse novels, Blandings, Psmith, Uncle Fred, Jeeves & Wooster, etc., and I think this one is the least successful.Archie is kind of a Wooster without the Jeeves, or even Bertie's wit. None of the other characters are developed beyond simplistic sketches and Archie's pratfalls just aren't enough to support the book."
5,A CD Named After A Song by Me!,"This CD is based on a song from the Phantom of the Opera-""Nightime sharpens,opens each sensatcion.Slowly the defences abandon there reflecxes-C'mon,you know the lyrics.This CD contains songs from the Phantom of the Opera,Cats,Aspects of Love and Jesus Christ Superstar.Another CD avaible in great detail."
3,NOT a region-free DVD player!,"Although a good DVD player, it is NOT a region-free (multi-zone) DVD player, despite technical descriptions posted on various seller internet sites (the official JVC website does not provide any useful technical information on which you can rely). I bought this player (XV N310B/312S) but figured out that it plays only DVDs with the following encoding: ALL, 1, 1-2, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4-5-6. It does not play DVDs that do not include code ""1"". When I asked JVC about the discrepancies between technical information provided by seller websites and the player's real technical configuration, I received the following e-mail reply on January 6, 2005: ""The information you have seen on the internet is incorrect. All DVD Players manufactured by JVC-America can only play Region 1 or discs that are Multi-Region discs that include ""1""."" THE SOLUTION: If you plan to buy a DVD player, first ask the manufacturer directly about technical details (do NOT rely on any other websites)."
2,"Poor sound, remote control logic gets confused","The sound quality from this player is poor, with manyCD's and DVD's sounding slightly distorted. There is amenu option for lowering the sound level and changing thedynamic range, which helps a little but it appears thesound hardware is flawed. When using the remote theplayer often refuses to respond to the Top Menu buttonuntil you stop the disk and then start it by pressing theTop Menu button. I've had to turn the player on and offto get it to play a DVD disk.All these flaws are fairly subtle, but noticable whencompared to the several other DVD and CD players I have.they seem to be design flaws rather than a defective unit.The video quality is good."
1,Old models -- Dont wate money on this junk,"Dear fellow amazon's loyal custoemrs do not waste money on this old model from JVC buy this years models JVC 512, 420, 422, NP10S ToshibaThis model is old JVC has discountinued it and these vendors are selling thier old clearance stock, we dont know if its till under warranty or not.JVC 422 is much nicer looking unit and JVC has replaced this JVC XV 412 with JVC XV 422S-"
5,Excellent Multi-Region Player,If you buy DVDs abroad and want to watch them at home without any hassle this DVD player is an excellent choice. Works flawlessly.
1,BROKE IN 5 DAYS,"Took longer than anticipated to arrive, worked fine, great picture etc. Front display vanished in 5 days. Need machine for work so can't face the hassle and delay of returning it and can work off TV screen menu. But buyer beware."
1,Waste of Money,This unit is total waste of money !!Lasted me only 65 Days!!I would not recoment it --- ? well that's my opinon at leastI would have rather sepnet some more and bought some decent player.
2,OK if you don't mind being left hanging at the end,"I like all I read of T's stuff online. This is not nearly so good as her online versions. For some reason, Ford and Mara have less lifeliness in published version than they did online. I have to say now I like Nyeta and Phoenix better than most of the main people (and Nyeta and Phoenix are the dragons!). Part of the problem is the book ends abrupt--why not have the whole book as one? Make no sense. Also, who checked for mistakes? There is so many mistakes even I can tell and I am bad at spelling and typos. I was real disappointed on this one. The love scene seemed shorter and less written well than the online version. Maybe I remembering it badly, but I just was disappointed. This is not up to T's regalar standards."
5,"RADD!! Romance, Adventure, Drama, Diversity","As a long time fan of T. Novan's various stories, I am thrilled to see this one published. It is an exciting story that introduces its readers to the possibility of a better world of the future, one that is willing to accept variations in lifestyle without judgement. But also a world still wrought with age old issues of jealousy, greed and revenge, and the struggles of two young lovers trying to make it through it all. This is one you will want to read again and again! Bravo, TN! This reader looks forward with anticipation to your next adventure!"
3,Don't Go See This Play On A First Date,"This is not a horrible play, but it is a horrible play to see on a first date. I made that mistake. I saw it back in the 80s off broadway in New York. I scored great tickets, first row. The theater was small and the stage was not set in an arch or elevated.One of the charactors/props in the play was a live orphaned baby lamb kept in a baby playpen at the front of the stage. The lamb kept licking our fingers during the play and was very cute. So far so good, this first date was going ok. I was scoring points with the girl I was with.Then the drama started. The family portrayed is disfunctional and under incredible stress. The violence increases and increases. Yelling, fighting--I don't want to spoil things for you, but things don't turn out well for the lamb at the end (for you PETA folks out there--through the use creative F/Xs no living lamb was hurt in the production). End result for me--not a very good first date. It was a better read."
4,Advanced Jefferson Studies,"This is not your typical Jefferson biography. This is advanced Jefferson studies about sexuality, slavery, prostitution, concubines and the many darker and even immoral sides of Jefferson and our other founding fathers. I find this book to be dark, but a book that tells the truth about Jefferson and other founding fathers and does not put them up on a pedestal as do most biographies. Americans have been brought up to treasure our founding fathers in a mystical way. As always the truth gets a short stick. Hopefully, someday in the future our civilization will evolve to cherish and adore the truth about the world around us. Sadly, at this point in time much of the truth is hidden from us, especially as pertains to our national leaders."
5,The 6 & 7 year olds really loved these DVD's,"The 6 & 7 year olds really loved these DVD's. They were funny, but very inspiring. They have asked to watch them again and again. I could use the key word (like Obedience) and they would both mentally snap to attention. You can see the little wheels turning in their heads. Helps teach morals."
2,Short on Self-Defense instruction.,"This book does give you good advice adout rape and rapist. But, the section on self-defense techniques is too brief, and the instruction is not complete enough to teach the average women proper techniques."
3,I've heard better from this group,"All praise to the CREATOR is GOOD PRAISE but I've heard better from this choir, they are beginning to sound the same as before. This CD seems to be lacking something. However, my love for these people will keep me expecting more.........."
2,Poor audio quality on this CD,"Zimmerman is an excellent pianist, and these ragtime selections are good. However, the distorted audio quality on this disk makes it one to avoid, even at the $5. price. Better recordings are available. This one sounds like the microphone was over-loaded."
1,Really low quality product,"Tamarined Candy is amazing. No doubt about it. However,the quality of Tamarind candy sold by Ur Asian Store is deplorable. I ordered 1 3.5 oz box and 2 4 oz boxes of Tamarind candy and instead received 3 boxes of 4 oz Tamarind candy. No problem there. Unfortunately, the candies themselves were old, stale, and worthy of my condemnation. There was no date label on any of the three boxes so I don't know how old they were, but I felt like I was consuming Candies that were years past their ""best by"" date. After tasting 2-3 from each box I had to throw all three boxes away. My only hope now is that I will not get sick from eating these expired Tamarind Candies.I strongly recommend anyone interested in buying Tamarind Candy to get it from any retailer other than Ur Asian Store here on Amazon."
2,Tasted Burnt & Stale,"I bought this product in hopes that it would taste like real ""Tamarind Balls"" from de islands. I was WRONG!The container is slightly bigger than an altoids tin can. I tried to share one of the several boxes of THAI TAMARIND CANDY with family members. However, they spat it out and complained ""Ewwh, this is gross"".Waste of money!"
2,The shop vacuum that could be much much better,"I have had three of these. The first one that was delivered was a used unit. The second unit had missing pieces. The unit I am now using has worked well -- but before filling the first bag the on/off switch broke. I gave up calling Shop-Vac and had a local vacuum repair shop fix it. If I were designing the unit, I would use hoses that were a size larger. I would also use a pull along design that did not pull away when using. The best part of the vac is the motor. It works as I need it to work. Overall, I give this a ""not recommended."""

5,"Bravo, Carreras!","I've been a fan of Jose Carreras since the mid 1980's, and I can never get enough of his beautiful voice.The CD, Boleros/Love Songs From Spain, is a wonderful example of his ability to crossover from Opera (WOW!) to ethnic and popular music.I know that if you love songs like You Belong to My Heart (Solamente Una Vez), you are in for a treat! The beauty of that voice spans time and music, and we are the beneficiaries of it!So listen, enjoy, and love every minute of this beautiful CD! Nobody can bring the warmth of vocal music to an audience the way that Maestro Carreras does!"
4,Nice Fresh sound,"It's Deutsch..it's gothic...and even a little big poppy fresh!Mmm, it's Kramm...they are quite an interresting group and their music is pretty fresh. Something nice....not like they are in the realms of Diary of Dreams....nope...but they are good Kramm!"
2,Works OK but back to Nylons,"Ordered this filter product in hopes that it would attach better to our washing machine's hose that drains into a stationary tub and is then pumped. We have had issues in the past with our pump getting clogged with lint and hair which leads to leaks. The product certainly traps lint but the issue was keeping the filter attached to the hose. The velcro attachments do not hold well and once they get wet they are even less effective. The picture shows an orange zip tie and white filter however we received gray velcro bands and a black cloth filter (which made it harder to see the lint when cleaning). I also found that the filter was not easy to clean, the lint just sticks too well. This means you will have to replace the filter often. We are back to using nylon socks and attach with zip ties or a strong rubberband. They are also much easier to clean and seem to last longer for us. I would not recommend this product but it may work better for you."
3,Sweetfiler gets the job done,"The Sweetfilter Washing Machine Filter/Lint trap is pretty good. It basically gets the job done, though I'm still convinced there's a much better design out there that hasn't been exploited yet. The velcro strap that it comes with to tighten on to the tube from your washing machine doesn't work for beans. You need to go with a hose clamp -- which you can pick up at any hardware store (in the plumbing or automotive departments) -- it's the only thing that will reliably hold your sweetfilter on. This really should standard with the shipped out product."
1,Poor Quality,Don't waste your money on this. The one I purchased fell apartafter four months. The end came off and is impossible to putback on so it stays.I will go back to using a nylon.
2,Sufficient but not worth it,Looks great and the ceramic burner tops are easy to clean. The large burner works ok but the smaller diameter burner is useless. Can't heat a kettle or warm anything. Definitely not worth the cost. Your paying for two but only recieving a mediocre single.
2,It does cook.,"Honestly, all I can say about this hot plate, is that it does indeed cook food. That being said, it only cooks on the left side. The right eye is useless, so multi-task cooking is not happening. The only result you're likely to see using two eyes is a tripped breaker. I would assume this means it is not a very cost-efficient device. The left eye (larger one) gets incredibly hot, even on the medium setting. Bringing something to a boil doesn't take as long as some claim, but getting that temperature back down takes a while. I use it almost daily, and I have used it almost daily for over a year now. It's tough, it cooks. There ya go."
3,I am not impressed. Perhaps I need to use product more.,"Thermostat does not maintain setting (low,medium,high). As a result pot burns quickly.Unit takes a long time to cool down. Have used this product for 3 weeks."
4,So good so far,So far so good with this hot plate. I read several of ratings about this product and others. I find this product to heat up quickly and cook well. I've cooked meat meals and soups and it does a wonderful job. In my opinion it cooks just like a stove top.
3,it's ok,"the burner comes before the estimation date. It's easy to use, however it takes seriously quite long to let it heated. the two burners give different heat range but they both work well. if you a person who can't stand to wait or u need to cook a lot, i don't suggest you to buy this one. however, if you only do light cooking, this is a good choice to make."
5,Very nice product,"Nice looking and works wonderfully, love the solid burner surfaces which stay very clean. Mine does have an ""on"" indicator - apparently earlier versions did not but they now do. Replaced a stove with only 2 working burners with this unit and a DeLonghi oven, gained enormous space and no sacrifice in cooking ability - and I cook a lot."
1,Poorly built,"The unit lasted 5 months and one burner quit altogether. After countless attempts I was finally able to reach Aroma, who agreed to take it back and fix it (at my shipping cost) and return it...in 4 weeks. Hardly worth the time and expense. I'd look for a different brand next time"
4,For USC Fanatics Only,This video is a nicely narrated summary of the Trojans undefeated 2005 regular season - it has some great shots in the locker room featuring the coaches and players behind the scenes.The individual game summaries are very limited however and don't always give one a great feel for the games.As for the negative reviews by Texas fans - maybe someday the Longhorns will win 35 straight or have back-to-back Heisman winners which could provide fodder for a highlight video. Texas fans should go buy the 2006 Rose Bowl video and bask in the joy of that game.
2,"someone remind USC that to be the greatest team of all time, you have to win your season's national championship!","USC had a great team, no doubt about it, 34 straight wins, two heisman trophy winners, two straight national titles, very impressive. However, they are NOT the greatest team of all time, despite all the ESPN bullcrap that was going on over the holidays. The Rose Bowl game showed that USC is nowhere near being the greatest team of all time, they couldn't even their season's national championship! Of course, no previous elite team ever had to deal with defending Vince Young, who should definitely have received the Heisman. Anywayz, USC had a great team, and deserved to be #1 throughout the season, but they ultimately met their match in the Rose Bowl."
2,Kind of Redundant,"I was kind of disappointed with Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs. It is a very thin book, I don't believe it was worth the money I paid for it. I had previously read Pryor's other book, ""Reaching the Animal Mind"", which I would highly recommend, but since that book was not specifically about dogs, I ordered this book thinking it would give some tips on using clicker training for specific dog behavior. I have to say I didn't read anything that I hadn't read from ""Reaching the Animal Mind"" and found it too simple to be of any help to me in applying to solve my dog training problems. I also ordered ""Don't Shoot the Dog"" by the same author and was more than pleased with that book. I guess if you have never trained your dog and your dog is a puppy, or doesn't have any problems and you just want to teach it some tricks then this book is a good intro, but if you get the two other books I mentioned, the ""Getting Started"" book contains no new info and is a waste of money."
4,A training method,I train basic obedience and generally do NOT use clicker training unless asked. When they do I give them this book. A good basic book on clicker training if that is the method you prefer.
3,go deeper,OK maybe thisis just me--but I consider Karen Pryor the clicker guru--and I wanted more than this offerred--a little too simple--alittle too light--but a quick read cover to cover.
5,Easy and Fun..,"It is a really good, easy to understand book about clicker training. Karen has a sense of humor, which makes clicker training seem fun as well as rewarding."
5,Book,It's definitely the best read on clicker training for dogs. Each step is very descriptive and will teach you how to do it.
5,clicker training for dogs,I chose ths book because I am familiar with the author. therefore I bought the book to learn more about training dogs with the clilcker method.
3,Could have been condensed greatly,"Certainly Ms. Pryor knows her technique and provides good step-by-step basic instructions about using clicker training with dogs. She covers the do's and don'ts and provides essential advice with some examples.However, I thought that the portion of the book that dealt specifically with training dogs was somewhat scant and would have rather seen more about problem solving and working with crossover dogs---e.g., dogs that have had other types of training before ever hearing a clicker---and much, much less of the history about the pioneering clicker training done with dolphins.Hence, I thought the book quite expensive for the amount of practical information it contained."
3,Great for introduction,"This book is very, very basic. If you've never heard or read anything about clicker training, it gives you a good overview of what it's about ad how to do it. The author explains how to shape basic behaviors and gives ideas for what you can shape your dogs to perform other behaviors.If you've done any training with your dog, especially any clicker training, skip this book. It's too basic for you."
3,Lacking in substance,"While this would be a decent book for someone that has done zero reading into clicker training, I found it provided very little over what I had already learned on the web and through a week of hands on with my new puppy. Way too much was devoted to how clicker training works with dolphins and pretty much any other animal, this is clicker training FOR DOGS. In summary, very basic even for a novice like myself.Structure also seemed very off. While you don't use a verbal command in clicker training until the animal is offering the behavior reliably, the book doesn't include this in the steps for sit/stay and down examples, referring you to later in the book and other books the author wrote for more detail as to when to introduce the verbal command."
5,It seems to work great.,"I'm new to clicker training but with the help of Karen's book, my dog seems to be responding to it. In fact today she got off her run and if it weren't for the clicker training, I would have had difficulty getting her back. I am looking forward to working my dog more with it."
1,Wrong Item Sent!!!,I don't hate it. I know nothing about it. The wrong item was sent to me and I was never able to get the thing I ordered. Is there a difference between rabbits and dogs? I think so. A rabbit clicker training book was sent to me.
3,book review,"very easy to read, well illustrated and full of very useful tips to start clicking with my dog!"
2,Clicker Training,"Not impressed so far. Cost a lot and my dog hates the clicker, no matter the treats, she runs when you click. Not sure if it is the dog or the book. I have trained dogs before without a clicker and never had a problem but this just is not working with my dog. I bought this kit and downloaded it on my Kindle, which was dumb on my part, but I just knew it was going to work with these great reviews. May work for others but I am just not impressed and out a lot of money."
5,The Best for Abs toning,"I've tried a variety of videos for toning the abs, and this is by far my favorite one. I like it better than any of the other videos in the ""Steel"" series. Leisa Hart, the trainer, is pleasant & professional, and the exercises really work. The section for arms is pretty easy unless you use fairly heavy weights."
5,"Must have, so comfortable, lots of compliments","These shoes are so adorable and comfortable. They are so versatile (work, going out, dress them up). A great accessory to have. Gold buckles are so cute. I've gotten many compliments."
1,Questionable reliability,"My H-P Pavilion A1150y desktop came with this MSI video card. It lasted exactly 1 year and 6 days before crapping out. Yes, less than a week out of warranty. Near as I can tell, the cooling fan quit working and the card overheated. Beware!"
2,Armband for shuffle - don't bother,"The iPod Shuffle is so small and light, you really don't need an armband. The Sporty Armband is about the size of a CD and could feasibly wrap around my arm twice. It is rather cheaply constructed, too. The Shuffle's nylon rope is sufficient to wear around your neck - don't bother with this armband."
5,Excellent prequel,"""The Forging of the Dragon"" explains why Vicia-Heinox came to be -- and is an excellent prequel to the three books Hughes wrote earlier about the One Land (and its various ""fragments"").If you read ""The Prophet of Lamath"" or ""The Power and the Prophet"" or ""The Wizard in Waiting,"" you're sure to like this book, as the few flaws in those books (mostly dealing with how Hughes dealt with his minor characters) have been rectified.It's not a really highbrow book, by any means, but there is a solid moral and ethical basis that makes this book truly engaging.Only authors I can think of that might be like Hughes are the current team of LaHaye and Jenkins -- but this is far less heavy-handed and far more lyrical to read.Five stars. Highly recommended.Barb Caffrey"
5,Duraco Saucer - Great Choice!,"For years I have used the thin clear plastic saucers for my plants - having to replace them almost every year because they would crack and leak. I finally invested in these Duraco saucers for all of my plants and am SO glad that I did. These saucers are very durable, and will last for years. By ordering them on-line, the cost was only pennies more than the thin plastic saucers I had previously used, and I could get all the different sizes that I need. A great investment!"
3,A book for a lover of dogs,If you are potty about dogs you will love this book.Actually i'm a cat person so i was waiting to be convinced although i don't dislike dogs.I found myself pleading with this book not to become sentimental although the dog seemed precocious but normal.Then it started talking about animals being tortured.Animals in fear or pain freaks me out so i couldn't continue.I skipped ahead to be soothed by a rescue in progress but landed on a page where the dog talks.More than sentimental it was daft.Being an adult book i assumed the title was a metaphor.
1,Bad book,I like books. I like dogs. I like books about dog stories. This book didn't meet my expectations.Well written and good character development but WAY TOO LONG WINDED!The author goes on and on and on and on about how the dog is treated and how this girl feels towards it. OK STOP BEATING US OVER THE HEAD. We get the point.The story itself is highly unrealistic and do I have to mention the crummy ending?! SO BAD. Such a letdown.Please don't read this book. Go write your own - you'll do better than she did.
1,terrible,"what ever you do, dont spend money on this book. it is the worst piece of propaganda i have read in a long time. compared to the working pitbull, this book does nothing but damage the breed. avoid at all costs."
2,"nice idea, but poorly executed","At first, I thought this was a memoir. Then I realized it's fiction. I really liked getting to know more about the Pit Bull, but she lost me when the dog starts to talk. Some of the dialogue was unrealistic. The ending is also discouraging."
3,Decent breadbox - ignore the freebies.,"This is a decent breadbox, maybe a teeny bit overpriced for what you get but I have no serious complaints about it and it serves its purpose completely. If you are deciding between this breadbox and another one and are tempted to choose this one because of the free flask and shaker...don't. These bonus items are cheap and tinny and not good at all. I discarded them both before even one use - the shaker was so cheaply made that its sharp edges were actually dangerous.But it's a fine breadbox."
5,These guys rock,"Sure, everyone knows Billy can play the bass. But take a listen to Dave and Paul. These guys can put 95% of todays players to shame. I just got a copy of the SHYBOY demo CD, (SHYBOY - the band, is Dave and Paul's current band) these guys can still play. If your ever in Buffalo catch thier show!"
5,excellence again,"I've now read 4 of Eckert's books and one is better then the next. He takes a period of our American History and makes it come to life. Even though these books are not historical fiction, he weaves events and people into a seemless story. Bravo again !"
2,American candle,This brand was not what I thought I was getting. My error!! It does not have the strong scent that Yankee candle does and so would never order it again.
2,Received broken,I received this candle broken when I first ordered it. Smelling how wonderful the spring rain scent is I requested the broken candle be replaced. I was very happy with how fast the replacement item came as well as how fast and free the return shipping was. However the replacement candle came broken as well. I am very disappointed with this product. I have ordered candles through amazon before but never received them broken meanwhile these came shuddered to me twice.
3,"Best smelling candle ever, BUT...","I absolutely love the scent of this candle! I definitely recommend it, but the only thing is that it burns fast AND the glass jar around the candle was broken (I read in another review that someone had the same problem too with a shattered glass jar). Still, the smell of the candle is awesome!"
1,Don't bother,"Bought this to replace a soy Cucumber Melon candle. You can't even smell any fragrance from this candle. I bought 2 Glade candles from the super-market for $3 each, they work nicely."
4,pad and sled review,"Pad fits sled well ,stays on and makes it comfortable. Worth getting as it adds to the appearance and use of wagon. Her dolls and her don't slide off so much.Nice looking wagon, you know the sort made by hand by local US craftsmen so bummed when I found out that mine came from a craftsman in China and didn't help out a small Colorado town, at least directly.So how does it work? Steering mechanism not so smooth, I needed to put some plastic washers in to loosen the feel and the handle is a little short for anyone over 6 feet to pull.Kid loves it though, deals with roads and tracks well and small enough to parent handle. Looks stylishly different from those red wagons made in a factory somewhere else in China.I'm guessing we'll keep it forever due to it's unique looks."
3,"A very naked - ""Naked City""",""" The Art of Memory"" presents Zorn & Frith embarking on some solo improvisations. At times very sparse, dark and threatening, it feels like the building blocks of more 'Naked City' excursions (The Ladder). Not as exciting as other Zorn - Frith collaborations, but still very engaging."
2,Some sparkling mad moments around lightly plotted dementia,"2 1/2Not one of Zorn's (along with frequent collaborator Fred Frith on guitar)strongest improvisational spats, this extremely stripped down, ugly rumination on memory sees the stark duo rushing down eight different, though similar sounding textural rabbit holes, producing more of an over-indulgent experiment then anything else. Still, noise-aficionados and Zornaphiles will likely embrace what was probably one of the eccentric composer's least structured and tonal works in some time, which meant quite a lot to the choir material like this may preach to. Pockets of sheer head-bursting, talented weirdness pervade the mostly shallow and slightly rewarding output...just don't expect the experience to add up to anything more then various moments of anti-music freakout finesse."
2,"Already been there, done that","I picked this up at Barnes & Noble and was going to buy it until I started browsing through it. This is so similar to another online-crime book I have, it's not funny. That book is Net Crimes & Misdemeanors by J.A. Hitchcock and was published in 2002 - Hitchcock starts out each chapter with online horror stories, then advice, much like this book. They say imitation is the best form of flattery, but I found it disturbing that Worley couldn't have been more imaginative in putting her book together, especially Chapter 6, which tells the story of Amy Boyer - this was covered much better in Net Crimes & Misdemeanors in Chapter 9. Visit www.netcrimes.net and see the difference for yourself with the sample chapter there. Although published in 2002, Net Crimes & Misdemeanors is still very current, has the accompanying web site with URLs mentioned in the book (and is kept updated) and is a much better read."
2,Jewish Budah,"Never finished it. From the bit I read it seemed rather superficial and silly. Her observations were often redundant. Perhaps had I read on I might have discovered some meaningful insights, but to me a book like this needs to be off and running or I put it down. There is so much I want to,know,that I can't waste my time trying to find meaning in a book like this."
3,A very personal point of combining Buddhism and Judaism,The writer tels us in her own intimacy and personal honest way how Buddhism is intergated with her born religous - Judaism and even may sometimes strengthens each other.
3,Jewish/Buddhist teachers,"A significant number of Westerners practicing Buddhism are Jews. What is the attraction of Buddhism? In this book, Boorstein shares how her experience of twenty years of meditation practice deepened and enriched her Judaism. Using her own story she shows how mindfulness meditation can lead to the appreciation of every moment, which imbues any religion with renewed meaning. I also recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold - another great Jewish/Buddhist teacher."
3,Poor Bad News Bears Rip Off,"Keanu Reeves plays a person who is scalping tickets, gambling, and drinking and has no choice but to coach a Little League team from the Cabrini Green housing project in Chicago as a condition of getting a loan from a friend.It's an enjoyable movie that makes you laugh. I wouldn't watch it with young children because there is a lot of bad language especially from the kids in the movie.There was one part that was depressing, but it's unfortunately a reality for some places in the country. It's one of those that would make a good rental when there is nothing to watch, but not something worth buying."
3,Keanu Reeves has split personality,"As this movie begins, Keanu Reeves is running away from the bad guys who are after him to collect gambling debts. In order to earn some money, he agrees to coach a boys' baseball team in the projects. Suddenly he is a teddy bear who knows exactly how to relate to small boys. When the boys are practicing, he is up in the stands smoking, but somehow they progress into a very viable team. His character changes drastically as he spends more time with the boys, and all of this seems to happen somewhat magically. It's hard to know who this film is for because there is too much cussing by the young actors for it to be suitable for kids and yet it purports to be a kid movie."
3,A Pleasant Surprise,When I went to see this movie with my girlfriend I was just trying to get some relaxation after a week full of stress. I honestly wasn't expecting much out of a Keanu Reeves movie but once again I was surprised. I fully enjoyed this movie and I would definitely watch it again. Keanu Reeves is good but the real stars are the kids.
5,The profanity used is the reality of the inner city children...,"I chose to watch this movie for a class in college. Many people have dissaproved of this movie because of all the swearing. Needless to say, the words used by the boys on the baseball team are the exact words that the children raised in the inner city use. The movie is very realistic. I would recommend this movie...it is not a good idea for a younger child to watch it because the conditions in the neighborhood are very bad. The movie is sad but real!!!"
5,Greatest buy of the year (2001),It was a great movie the best baseball movie of the year (what am I saying) EVER!!!!! I'm outa words I don't want to give it away it's not worth it it's better to watch (BUY IT!!!!) even if you don't have interest for baseball it still has a good storyline
3,Show Up!,"Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is a man who suffers from a gambling addiction and has ended up with a $12000 debt. He seeks out a friend in order to pay of his debt, but instead ends up with a coaching job that pays $500 week for coaching underprivileged kids in the rough parts of Chicago. Conor does not enjoy his new position, but he needs some money in order to begin paying of the loan sharks. He also wants to set up another big bet where wants to borrow a rather large amount of money in order to cover the bet, and at the same time he wants to get away from the coaching job. However, the kids on the team make him see something else. Hardball is a film that entertains and exposes a story about our existence."
4,Beauty out of ugliness.,"A moving story and very well played by all concerned. The ugliness and depravity of the context pictured in this movie serve to show that, no matter what the odds are, the beauty of the human soul can emerge in spite of everything. Just two reservations. First, I found the dialect hard to follow: even when I turned on the very helpful subtitles, the meaning often escaped me. Secondly, the enormous change for the better that Conor O'Neil experiences by having to take charge of his young players happens somewhat too quickly. In spite of this, however, the process itself is quite credible and so, given the time constraints of a two-hour movie, you don't need too much good will to suspend disbelief and accept a few psychological corners being cut rather short. - All in all, I find the idealism exemplified in this movie extremely comforting."
5,Excellent Movie,"this is one great movie.it deaqls with real life problems.""One of the most important things in life i showing up.i'm blown away by your ability to show up) very emotional movie.but one of the best ones i have ever seen."
1,I didn't know it was...,"...still legal to produce movies like this one.Seems like they had a 20 million $ budget. 20 million for Reeves and 50 bucks for the rest...It's all been done. It'a all been here before. But this movie is the 500.000.th of a kind of movie I thought we already had enough of.What I like about the film: its predicability. I simply love the way the romance is introduced. Up high in the competition for corniest scenes in the last twenty years.Oh and when the little boy was shot...please don't read on when you're easily offended...that was oh well, let's put it this way, rather a laugh than a cry. holy joy of cliché.From what I have learned reality is far from the kind of Disney-Ghettoism promoted in here...All in all: how can hell be any worse?"
1,Very Very bad movie,One of the worst movies made by Paramount pictuers.Veryweak performances with a stupid screenplay.Also the musicscore is not good and Keanu Reeves is not a brilliant actor.It does not deserve a 1 star.
1,Hardball,"Hardbal is about a down-on-his-luck gambler (Keanu Reeves) who is extorted into coaching a baseball team of inner-city kids to help pay off his gambling debts. With the help of these kids and their teacher (Diane Lane) he pulls his life together and takes his team from worst to first.Well, Hollywood did it again folks. Another cookie-cutter, down-and-out loser, thrust into a role of responsibilty, meets the straight-laced love interest, and ultimately succeeds. Of course it is capped off with the loser's obligatory ""heart-tugging"" speach to show that he really has seen the ""light."" Every conflict in this movie is almost immediately resolved, and this ""baseball"" movie includes only one scene of the team practicing. I advise anyone thinking they are going to get 2000's version of the Bad News Bears, to think twice about watching this movie. The plot is cliche, the outcome predicatble, and I came away from this movie groaning."
1,Just When You Thought It Was Safe To Go To The Video Store,All self respecting humans and film geeks run for cover. This movie is like going through the worst kind of surgery in the most god awful places.
1,This movie was awful!!!,"Keanu gives his worst performance yet! A film that should have never gotten past pre-production. A horrible script along with an actor that should have never even considered this film. Diane Lane is the only descent actor in this movie. Go rent ""The Matrix Trilogy""!!-Kevin"
2,Just Showing Up Isn't Always Enough,"""Hardball"" is a sanitized, sluggish, spasmodic, stereotyped baseball movie very loosely based on Bob Muzikowski's real-life experience living in the Cabrini-Green housing projects and starting a Little League baseball program for his new neighbors. Although I'd like to give the movie three stars just because of G-Baby's smile, it isn't good enough. Aside from its departures from the real-life story, the movie is too conventional, formulaic and disjointed and the acting from the lead is painfully awkward. He careens wildly from dark desperation to a mediocre Jerry Lewis impersonation to Knute Rockne-type speeches, which are delivered with a peculiar stiffness, except for the arms, which resemble someone signaling a taxiing airplane. Some of ""Hardball's"" themes are vitally important but, in this case, the book, ""Safe at Home"" deals with them much more effectively."
3,eh,"i do like this movie, but k reeves i do not. It has a nice story to the film and the kids can be kind of funny."
2,A Miss.,"Hardball seems charming at first but I just ended hating this film, too serious and soapy for me. Keanu Reeves and Diane Lane are good in this baseball comedy/drama but I couldn't get into the plot and the ending is so melodramatic. Skip this stereotypical film at all costs."
3,Save the day.,"This movie is quite spotty. It's basically a story about a guy who gets himself in deep sh*t with the bookies. He doesn't have the money to pay these guys off for the bets he lost. The guy (Keanu Reeves) ends getting a five hundred dollar a week paycheck for working in the projects for a black baseball team. There's some funny stuff on here, but really, this movie really doesn't revolve around the actual game as much as the title of the film would imply. At times I felt like I was watching a poor man's version of 'Hoosiers' (a GREAT sports flick, by the way), but Keanu saves the movie from turning into a real pile."
4,I love it when you call me big poppa!!,"I had little to no intention of ever watching this movie and luckily one day being bored I figured I would give it a glance...and eneded up glued to the TV right to the end. I was amazed that Keanu pulled this roll off. But the true stars were the kids, I really ended up feeling for them and the lives they had to live. The only thing they ever did that was ever fun....was play baseball. Bad News Bears it's not! Sure you know what the ending is and if you ignore the fact that Keanu never coaches them once until the end of the movie, you'll find a really great film you may have missed, like I did."
3,Enjoyable,"This is a decent movie and deserves the 3 stars, but Mr. Reeves acting on the other hand deserves 1 star. His performance was the only bad thing about this movie."
2,The Kids are Not Funny,"I was disappointed after the movie ended because it looked like it would be a typical coming-of-age film about a gambling Keanu Reeves who needed to get back on track. He coached a little baseball team and hated it. I hated it just by watching it. The soppy ending ruined whatever chance this movie had of being different from the others, but it just fell flat."
5,Hardball,"The movie proved that Keanu Reeves is very capable of expressing emotions on screen, contrary to his harshest critics. He was able to convey his initial attitude change from someone who was only coaching a kid's baseball team for money he desparately needed, to someone who genuinely cared with subtle finesse. It wasn't a cartoon character performance. The child actors also performed at a professional level not expected from their age group."
4,An entertaining film,"This film was entertaining. Keanu Reeves and Diane Lane were great in this movie. Be warned, it turns into a shocking tear-jerker but overall it is a very cute movie. There is a lot of bad language in this film, so I wouldn't recommend it for very young children. I think it's a fine film to watch with your children, provided they are warned about the language before hand."
5,it's a great book,"this is a great book--it opens your eyes to a lot that jim morrison was going through, and shows what a genius he truly was. it inspired me to write poetry, as i think it has many others."
5,A very interesting collection of poetry!,"As I was reading this book, I was overwhwelmed by the brilliance and mystery of the writings in the collection. I always enjoy reading poems that you have to stop and think about, something I have come to expect from the late, great Jim Morrison. The entries were nothing short of phenomenal, and I would be disappointed if the collection delivered any other assortment of writings. I am a relatively new fan of Jim Morrison's poetry, but the impact was incredible. I recommend the book to anyone looking for a challenging read and a few unfathomable, and at times, very confusing, writings, by a truly brilliant artist!"
3,I think I was once I think we were...,"I think this is a very good poetry book.There are several pages worth bookmarking.It is,in my opinion a very candid,in-depth look at what Morrison was feeling.He writes about his (short) life,fame,death,Pam & his youth.His self-interview in the beginning of the book says it all,as far as what poetry really,or is supposed to be or mean.I highly recommend this book.Pages:5,11,13,15,16,34,45,53,54(the best poem of all),58,61(second best),71,77,106,127,145,197(third best),199.The final pages consist of a section called:""As I Look Back"".It vaguely sums up his life,as he saw it."
2,Poetry only a die-hard fan could love,"It's sad that Morrison wanted to be remembered as a poet when the sad fact is that he really wasn't that good of a poet. Abstract and vague, tending toward rambling private lines, _Wilderness_ simply isn't poetry. Rather, it is a collection of ideas and insights by a man who was truly talented. Morrison could write SONGS--not poetry. Perhaps he graced us with ""The End,"" but poetry is not his forte. I am always moved by ""When the Music's Over"" and ""The Unknown Soldier,"" but with the maudlin and confused lines offered in _Wilderness_, I can't help wondering exactly what Morrision had in mind. A good ready only for die-hard Doors/Morrison fanatics."
1,No Mr. Mojo Risin' for me in this book.,"I have been a huge fan of The Doors/Jim Morrison since the first time I heard ""Light My Fire"". I think it was 1967. I was in high school and playing in a rock band. Today I still love the songs/lyrics/poems of The Doors. I was excited to get ""Wilderness"", but when I finished it an hour or so later I was quite disappointed. I'm sure Jim would not care that I didn't like it and I still have the highest respect for him even now. I think the people who put this volume together was scraping together whatever was left over to make a buck off of Jim's estate. I'm glad I only paid $4 for it but I feel cheated of the hour I spent reading ever word cover to cover hoping to find ""The Mojo"". I hope the person who gets my copy after I put it in the Goodwill box doesn't have to pay much for it. I would give it to a friend but I don't want any of them to waste their time with it. Maybe I just didn't get it?"
5,Jim Morrison: Overlooked poet,"Wilderness is a wonderful book for anyone who loves to write, or deeply enjoys reading poetry. It is quite sad that some people in our society automatically think that Morrison's poetry is trash just because of the fact that he was a rock star as well as a poet. Morrison wrote beautifully and the depth that he concentrated into each one of his works shines through. This is a great book for anyone who appreciates Morrison or good poetry, I highly recommend it."
5,Haunting,"The words and images in this book have a way with your mind. They stick in your subconscious as if they are the stories your ancestors told around the campfire.Jim Morrison's poetry is a mix of Greek mythology, and Shamanic mysticism. Throw in some books from long ago that are deep in the blood of mankind, and you end up with Morrison.His poetry does not talk about himself. Instead he writes about archetypical themes in a modern setting. His setting was the 60's, which provided a lot of material: Vietnam, new drugs, the Women's Rights Movement, and the Civil Rights Movement.All of these things were ripping at the fabric of America (and humanity). Morrison's poetry attacks these chaotic times head on. However, he writes as if he were a 19th century poet in the mold of Lord Byron, or Arthur Rimbaud. He achieved his goal, and a place in history."
2,Not bad. Not great.,"I've been a big Doors fan for 20+ years. I like Jim, I like the legend. This book of poetry is....ok. I'm gonna guess there's only one man who knows what the majority of these poems are about. I like poetry too, but alot of what's here seemed almost like random words thrown together. Some of it literally was. I did notice a number of times lines that ended up in Doors songs, portions of lyrics. I'll take hearing some of his poetry backed with music anyday over just reading it. I just recently heard singer Neko Case refer to Jims poetry as high schoolish. That might be a little harsh, but she's not far off. The pictures in the book we've all seen before. I did like seeing copies of his handwriting. This took me 90 minutes to get through. I'm glad I read it, but I'll stick with the American Prayer album next time."
4,work jacket,"I received this item in a timely fashion.I tried on the jacket and noticed it was short in length.I needed a XL-long instead of Xl-regular.I sent an email to the vendor.There reply was to purchase the correct one.I was wanting to exchange the one I received for the correct size.I didn't think I had to make another purchase to get what I need.I haven't worn the jacket I received from the vendor.May I get your help on this matter.Thanks,Kevin Crawford"
1,Warning the product description is inaccurate,This item does not come with the wrought iron basket as described in the description. I purchased what seemed like a very nice item as a gift and was extremely disappointed when I only received a box full of wood. Upon calling customer service I was told that the basket would cost an additional $39.95.
4,"Good action, logical and more or less believable.","A variant of the coming-of-age tale set in the authors present time (1988). It is a fairly fast moving page-turner with good writing. The author seems to indicate sequels, and I would read them if they existed. A good effort for the time it was written in."
4,camper cover,"This cover fit our 14' pop-up (with an air conditioner on the top) just fine. So far, it seems to be doing the trick. We'll see how it holds up to our winter here in The Black Hills."
5,Great RV Cover,This cover works great and my experience with these is that during the hotest month(s) of the summer I put a sacrificial tarp over the top to extend the life of it beyond the warranty period.
5,The best text we have for this area.,"I have successfully used this book as the major text in both undergraduate and post graduate HCI and Interaction Design subjects. I am grateful that is available as it is by far the best text available for these subjects. It is particularly strong on the social and contextual issues that are so fundamental to the design of robust and usable technology and are often so difficult to convey to students who lack real design experience.It is well organised, very clearly written and provides many useful examples and practical exercises. These are all designed to make some very complex material accessible to readers whatever their knowledge of the field. I have also used some of the support material that is available for those teaching from this text. It is designed in such a way that it can be easily incorporated into existing course material and has saved me a lot of time!"
1,Interaction Design,The majority of this book is from the thoughts and findings of other authors. Nothing orignal. Books is difficult to read and often does a poor job of explaining topics clearly. Currently using this book as a text book for a class and have to believe there is a better choice out there.
2,Too much padding,"The book is long-winded and filled with copious padding stuff. The authors seem forgot the basic design principle. It is extremely annoying to read the same material again and again on the same page and in different chapters, especially when the material covered is already common sense in nature."
4,Book,"Although it's a hassle to do returns, because the book arrived in a timely fashion, I was able to sell it to someone else in time to get the book I needed."
3,It works.,"The item description is unfortunately non specific when it comes to the teeth on the sprocket. A detail which is fairly important in the functionality of a chain drive bicycle. The sprocket that I received is a 19 tooth, which is quite large when paired with a 16 inch rim also required a new chain to compensate for the extra teeth. It works, but it is not ideal for the Schwinn Pixi that I was restoring for my daughter.They also advertised that the coaster brake components were Shimano, but what I received was some no name brand. Still works, but not really what I was told I was purchasing.Would have been nice to have some extra thrown in to compensate for the component change such as a rim strip, but there was not even an explanation on the packing slip.The packing was fine and the shipping though UPS was quick so that was nice. All in all I am satisfied."
3,"not really a ""review"", per se","but more of an 'about this product'. i've never used this product, so don't think the 3 stars mean anything. i was, however, really curious as to what exactly this product does. and amazon provided NO info. according to their website, this novaxchange thinganajigger is data management and tape backup software.in case you were wondering."
5,They work like they are supposed to,"These are hard to find in the stores. When you do, they are usually way over priced. I think my local Big W department store had the Arm and Hammer brand for $8 for 3 bags. These were much cheaper and OEM branded. They are made by Eureka to fit Eureka vacuums that use the U bags. I've had issues with non-OEM bags not fitting well."

4,BEFORE YOU GO - read this book,"I expected to like this book, and I did. But I liked it a lot more than I expected. It is a totally believable story with a real ring of truth, told in the first person. Mattie endured and overcame the narrowminded insults of a small town in her childhood, love and betrayal, abuse and hard work, and she met them all head-on, never feeling sorry for herself or blaming someone else. I expected a romance, but this book was more. It didn't exactly have a happy ending, but it had a realistic and satisfying one.This book is good for adults and teens. For adults it provides insight into a difficult life, and opportunities to reevaluate one's own life in comparison. For teens it provides an example of following one's dreams, working hard, and overcoming adversity. All these lessons and entertaining, too!"
5,Never has erotica been so much fun!,"Erotica 101 is not a book to be read while in public, as it only takes about two of these tantalizing tales before you want to grab your honey and head for somewhere more private. I suggest leaving your copy next to your bed so you'll be prepared when these stories work their magic. Then open the book at random and just start to read. Funny, provocative, sensual and stimulating, Erotica 101 will become your favorite bedtime stories. I can't wait for the next course!!"
2,Not good,"These seeds pretty much taste like dirt with cayenne pepper and soy sauce. Every handful you pop in your mouth has a few 'bad seeds' that make the decent ones taste bad too. I bought a case of these and can't even make it through the 1st bag. I was hoping for a taste similar to a davids pumpkin seed without all the shells and salt but add some spicy flavor. These are tiny little seeds that are mushy. The spicy flavor gets very tired quickly, and the overall taste is not good. I hate to write a bad review, but I wish I read one before buying."
3,hot,"If you like heat with every mouthful, this snack is for you. But buyer beware if you DO NOT LIKE HOT, do not buy. The taste is also very different tasteing than from what I expected, kinda bland with the heat."
3,shelled?,"I eagearly opend the box from Amazon, and was disappointed in that I thought they were in the shell...oh well I can give them as gifts..."
5,A Healthy Organic Alternative.Spicy Hot,"These organic pumpkin seeds are a winner.You might not think you can get a good snack out of seeds,so this has got to be the best kept secret in snackery! And if you`re a guy with a prostate issue,look no further.If you`re a gal, the omerga 3&6&9 and zinc and potassium and various other minerals not listed has got to be good for whatever might concern womens health .If you`re a kid, they taste a lot better than they look and a lot cooler to eat than greasy potato chips.(chew thoroughly before digesting)"
4,good purchase,difficult to get so was pleased to find it on your market placePrice was good as was exported from usa
4,The best explaination for the modern history of mankind.,"Karl Polanyi has provided us with a cut-throat explaination as to how the market system has shaped and formed our person and existance. From the demolition of community to modern business and personal ethics, Polanyi explains who we are, our present Darwinistic purpose, and, not to mention, the price each of us carries with us. Absolutely a must-read for those who truly demand to know what has happened to mankind since the industrial revolution."
1,translation please,did I miss the information that this was in the original German - that I don't read? Now what?
2,The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time,"Well worth a read, especially for the free marketeers and Ayn Randian Voodoo economics crowd. Forget about Hayek and von Mises. This is the real thing."
5,Super Solano 1875 watts,"This unit is often seen in professional salons and really does the job. I think you could remove paint with this baby. Guaranteed to last and last. There is a company back east ( RBI Distributors in Skokie, Il,) that will repair/recondition Solano Dryers. Good value! Our unit is in its 5th year with no problems. Crank it up. This will be your last hairdryer. 5 stars!"
2,Disappointed!,"I was not as happy as I wanted to be about this product. I finally decided to spend the money on a good, quality hair dryer and this one was just disappointing. It is heavy and only has two speeds...barely blowing and blow your head off! There are no attachments either!"
1,Don't buy,"I decided to try a Supersolano, have had an Elchim for 8 years. Bought the Solano on March 5th 2011, it broke this past January.....not even a year of use! It's also big and loud. Save your money.BTW, I have short hair, so it didn't have that much use!"
3,Not sure what all the fuss is about...,"I purchased this dryer several months ago after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon. I'm still waiting for the bliss that other reviewers apparently feel when they use it. It's a hair dryer, guys. It blows hot air. It has multiple heat and air settings and a cold air button -- just like a $10 Conair from Walgreens.One small annoyance: The temperature and air speed setting toggles are poorly placed. They are on the handle like other dryers but they sit right where your fingers rest, making it easy to inadvertently change it to a lower setting when moving it around to dry your hair. Irksome.The product works ok, and it should, for $85.00. Apparently the Solano name justifies the exorbitant price.Still, I can't believe I paid $85.00 for a hair dryer..."
5,No need to ever be without one!,"To the lady who said hers just wore out. That never needs to happen. RBI Distributors in Skokie, Il, the distributor for Solano here in the U.S. will completely repair and refurbish any Solano, working or not for about $30. I have had it done on a few occasions (old wiring, heating element won't work, etc.) and they have a quick turnaround and great customer service. The number to call is (847) 675-0087. Great product and now you know how to keep it working!"
5,Terrific,"I was looking for a really good hair dryer and I definately found it in this one. It has a lot of power and dries my hair quickly. Also, it has a really long cord, which is good for me because I tend to sit down away from the plug while drying my hair. The only negative might be that it's pretty heavy, so it's not the best for travelling. I need that 5 lbs or so for shoes!"
5,Fabulous Dryer,"You get what you pay for! I never had a professional dryer before & was a bit nervous putting out the $$ but it is totally worth it. The dryer is somewhat heavy in comparison to my drug store version but not a big deal. I love that it never gets too hot to touch. My hair looks much smoother; no frizz. The extra long cord is a bit much for a small bathroom, however, when I am elsewhere I don't have to be overly concerned that a mirror & outlet are not right next to each other. It is powerful; yet quiet."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this product. I have been using a hairdryer to blow out my hair for over 10 years and I have never come across a dryer that damaged my hair as much as the SuperSolano did. After using this dryer my hair was left brittle and frizzy (and I happen to have healthy hair). Needless to say, I returned it."
3,"Decent dryer, very pricey, don't know how much more you get for your money","It's a good dryer, super loud and drys really really fast. Amazon pricing is the best around. just doesn't seem like it's worth all the extra money then the $30 one i bought, other then some extra weight to it. guess it might last longer, but i could buy 2.5 of the other one for this one's price, and i don't see it lasting more then twice as long."
5,Very Quiet cooling for the money,"I have this fan in my office and I'm very satisfied with the performance. I previously had an old box fan that was very loud and didn't put out much air. This little baby is compact, lightweight, and easy to position. The air that this thing pushes is incredible, even at it's lowest setting, it's very quiet. I recommend this fan to anyone who needs extra cooling or wants to save money on their electric bill."
2,Not made in USA......that's the problem,"Once upon a time, PAtton fans were made in New Haven Indiana. That's when they were truly good products. Not any more. First a sale to Rival and a move to sweet springs MO turned out to be a disaster. Then a purchase by the Holmes group and it was goodbye domestic production.Enter China, the new workshop of the world. All the fans are now sourced from China. So a are most Lakewood units. The motors are very cheap now, non lubricating and very noisy.Sad to say, but an american icon has gone the way of the hula hoop, allin the interest of the cheapest possible price at your local big box store."
2,Quality not representative of Patton's reputation,"The main reason for purchasing this fan was because of our luck with Patton products in the past. We currently own several Patton fans that have lasted forever without ever breaking or getting too loud. We now need new fans so we decided that Patton was the way to go. The fans arrived and we were extremely unhappy because one was severely damaged and one was very loud (a clicking noise in the motor I think). We returned the 2 fans for a replacement, and the same issue occured with the excessive noise. Ultimately we returned them for a refund and we will not buy Patton fans in the future. If you do not mind loud noises with your fan, then this fan still might be the one for you. If you like a quiet fan, then look somewhere else. I hate to say this, but Patton's quality is going downhill."
1,Poor design,"The thermal switch on this thing went open and the fan will not run after less than two years of service. Other interesting features include the speed switch cycling the neutral...Other reviews cite poor customer service so I'm not going to even try to capitalize on the ""25 year warrantee.""I would not buy another Patten product."
5,Sturdy Simplicity,"My 14 inch Patton fan performed wonderfully during the summer past. It has a remarkable ability to send a channel of air a considerable distance across a large room into an adjoining room, which is wonderful when you need it. It is study, all metal (I'm tired of the flimsy plastic that falls over or breaks as on other fans I've seen). It is a bit noisy on the high speed, but medium & low seem generally enough all I need. Nothing complex and no attempt to make it look like anything but what it is -- a basic, hard working air-mover. At the special price offered,I bought a second one as a backup! Because of the long distances it moves air, it's also great to use to dry floors after washing, winter or summer. A great buy!"
2,Patton Rattleing Junk,"Dear Reader,I have a 14 inch Patton Fan model U2-887 that was pulled from the Dumpster. No suprise!! The cage around the fan rattles and drives you nuts. The motor bearings are worn and the fan blade wobbles and rattles until the motor bearings warm up.The Fan reportedly comes with a 25 year warranty, but ""The Holmes Group Manufacturer does not list the service centers conveniently on their website. It almost seems like they are making it difficult to get service for your in warranty fan.I have just started down the road to get warranty service, its not easy. I don't recommend this product. It would almost be easier to buy another fan from a different company.Imagine what shipping to a service center may cost! If I ever find one.Thomas StarichMadison, Wisconsin"
3,limited life span,"purchased these fans about 2yrs ago. now they screech and may stop altogether especially when titlted. they appear to desparately need lubricated but have tried silicone, oil etc.there are no instructions re this. anybody know about servicing them?"
3,Disappointing,"My girlfriend bought this fan for me online thinking it was just like another I had pointed out to her at Home Depot. It was not...This fan is okay at first, provide adequate ventilation at all speeds. However, within a month it began rattling due to inconsistencies in the manufacture - the parts just don't fit together very well. The rubber insulators seem to help, but the cage itself required the addition of weather-stripping material to get the noise down to a tolerable level.All of this would be forgivable if the motor hadn't died after 1 year of service. Perhaps mine is an unusual case. It was my first, and probably last, Patton fan."
2,"Great, unless you lose something","Somehow, we lost the screw and other parts that holds the fan to the base. I just got off the phone with Patton Fans who told me they don't have this fan. ?! I had to direct them to the amazon.com listing of the product, to prove it exsisted. To be told again, they didn't have the fan, or the parts. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who might need a replacement part.If anyone out there has an idea where I can get those parts (other than the manufacturer and the place I bought it from, apparently), feel free to email me.Patton Customer service is a joke (I will admit the woman I spoke to was very polite, and patient.)If the fan were usable, with the stand, I'd probably give it 4 or 5 stars. It does a great job of cooling, if you like the windturbine effect."
5,Outperforms the bunny!,"After 18+ years, it still performs on demand. For two years I had dangling (swinging gently 360 degrees) from the cabin ceiling of my boat in Miami, on a 5-hour-per-day timer, to circulate air during the hottest hours of the day while I was away. It never let me down. It still works fine and I am looking for another just like it."
3,100 YEARS OF HORROR,"I ENJOYED LEE'S PERSONAL STORIES.PICTURE WAS FINE.MOST WAS INFO. ABOUT THE STARS (OLDER) BUT INTERESTING.HAD A GREAT TIME WITH THE HISTORY AS WELL.IF YOU'RE INTO HORROR HISTORY, THIS IS BEST COLLECTION I'VE SEEN.THIS COLLECTION COVERS A LOT OF STUFF"
2,"Only for The Most Desperate of ""Horror"" Fans","Unfortunately, the folks who put this ""documentary"" together seem to think horror is confined to cheezy Grade Z movies full of excessive ""knife across the eyeball"" style gore. A somewhat comatose Christopher Lee seems ashamed to be hosting this mess."
3,Watch the original films!,"This appears to be a TV series that was assembled on DVD and marketed a single, lengthy entity. Because of that, there is extensive repetition of both footage and narrative dialogue. It consists mainly of trailers, and omits much of the classic horror catalog in favor of lesser films. It has very little educational value, with the exception of some talking head comments from people actually involved in the original creation process of the films themselves.With that said, it is still worth the price because of it's 12.5 hour running time. That's a lot of entertainment for less than $20. In addition, let's face it, Chris Lee fans would watch him read a telephone book, and there is plenty of Mr. Lee here."
1,Never Recieved the product,I never received this product so I can not review it. I ordered it through AMAZON.COM and they never sent the magazine. DO NOT ORDER MAGAZINES THROUGH AMAZON.COM. I called customer service and being re-routed several times I finally spoke to a customer service agent who said the magazine is on its way. That was two weeks ago and I still have not received any copies of the magazine. DO NOT ORDER THROUGH AMAZON.COM. Order all magazines directly through the publisher or any other way. AMAZON.COM was a terrible experience. If I ever recieve the magazine I am sure the first issue will show that I started receiving the magazine at the order date so I will have to fight with them to have my subscription end with the my first delivered magazine.
1,AVAILABLE FROM THE SAME SELLER DIRECT @$64!,"After placing an order for this subscription at $103, the Amazon confirming e-mail arrived, stating that the order was to be filled by CheapMagDepot. I Googled CheapMagDepot and found the same 1-year AW subscription on their site for $63! Needless to say, I cancelled the Amazon order and placed it with CheapMagDepot direct."
4,"Great content, poor editting","I have been subscribed to AW&ST; for almost two full years, and have to say the magazine is great. The content is both varied and informative, and the whole world is covered fairly well. I am currently trying to figure out how I am going to scrounge up the money to renew my subscription for another year.The only real complaint that I have had with the magazine is the poor editing. I don't expect a perfect magazine, but the frequency of simple spelling mistakes and occasional grammatical errors is astounding."
2,common sense,"I suppose somewhere there might be someone who can benefit from this book, although I can't imagine they're old enough to have a job yet so they're going to be borrowing money from mom and dad to buy this. There are some pretty pictures explaining basic science of some health issues. A nice illustration of what an ingrown hair is, for instance. If you need a picture to understand that kind of thing. You'll also be taught the mysteries of how to floss, how to brush your teeth, how to cut your fingernails, and what body types can wear a double breasted suit.Eventually the book makes it way to general issues of health -- prostate health, cancer, heart disease -- and things improve a little bit. Still not enough to make me think buying this book is worthwhile, though. Check it out from your local library and you can skim all the useful information in under an hour."
4,"Another Notch On The ""Proof of Aliens"" Belt","A friend of mine worked at area 51 for awhile and, although he was sworn to secrecy, he did tell me that there were things he saw that were very ""exotic."" Things he had never witnessed since. Although I respect his vow of ""loose lips sink ships"" I get the feeling that what happened in Roswell NM isn't a lone incident.Europe's Roswell, UFO Crash in Aberystwhyth proves this. There were so many witnesses to this strange happening and some pieces of this strange ship were left behind. These aren't tiny pieces either, one is about a 12""x12"" and doesn't look like anything I've seen in my life. If it was simply a weather balloon or some other easily explainable happening, why the big cover up? Governments don't want us to know about these beings. I found this DVD to be fascinating and another notch in the ""UFO proof"" belt."
5,May be time-consuming BUT saves serious $$,"I admit that putting in this battery is a little time-consuming and a very detailed work, BUT considering how much this little battery set cost vs. how much it costs to ship the ipod back to Apple, it is WORTH IT. Make sure you follow the instructions very carefully. I probably got it done it less than an hour. I successfully replaced the battery and went from my ipod lasting less than 30 minutes to it lasting for 8 hours plus."
3,good for 6 months,I have Ipod mini (2nd gen) and used to change its battery at Apple store before. I installed it about 10 months ago. Installation was easy for me and it worked good for the first 6 months. Now the battery won't last 2 hr even if it's fully charged but still it's cheaper to get a new one than have it sent back to Apple factory (their battery lasted about 1 yr anyway).I wouldn't use this battery if my Ipod is new (<2yr) and knew some people who had trouble installing it but I was willing to just get a new one if I had damaged my Ipod while installing it. I'm actually thinking of getting a new one.
5,Did the trick! No need for a new iPod,"The battery brought my iPod mini back to life! I was ready buy a new iPod nano, but no need now. The mini hasn't held a charge like this for a couple of years now, its like new again.One word of caution though to those purchasing this product. The iPod mini is not designed to be disassembled for battery replacement by a consumer. The white top and bottom plasic pieces are glued on and must gently be pried off to avoid excessive scratching or breaking. Sliding the circuit board with the new battery into place is also somewhat of a delicate procedure. I recommend that you do this in good lighting, be in a patient mood, and DON'T force anything into place! Everything will work fine if you are gentle and finesse everyting into (or out of) place."
2,Good idea - use with extreme care,"I'm a power geek: I've designed and built circuit boards, PhD in physical chemistry, have no fear or qualms about building and repairing computers. But I blew this repair - used too much force and ripped the molex connector off of the mother board. Just for kicks, I continued the procedure and found extreme difficulty getting the motherboard to slide past the screen glass without damaging soldered-on chips. I know that micro-soldering is not my strength - so I consider my mini a loss. The product looks good, but technique is critical. Beware!"
5,Very Easy To Do,I replaced two iPod batteries using these kits. One was for an iPod mini and the other was for an iPod 30GB Video. The mini was a little bit easier to replace but both took me less than 15 minutes to replace each. All I did was search for videos online on how to do it and followed the directions. It was worth not paying the $60 to have apple replace the battery. Both iPods are working like new.
3,battery,"This was bought to try to get an old ipod working, didn't work so I guess it was not the battery so we gave it all away. The battery fit well so I assume it was good."
3,Not everything pictured but did the job,I bought the replacement battery but there was no pry bar like in the picture and no screen saver. I had no use for the screen protector and I happened to have my own tools. The battery fit perfectly...I followed the instructions on youtube. Here are some points to consider:- I used a guitar pic and and tool for similar to a guitar pic to pry the ends of the ipod off. No blow dryer needed as mentioned in several posts.- The process was fairly simple...I think it's manageable by most people.- No screen protector- Came with two mini screw drivers - which you can use. I read and saw in the video that metal tools can scratch the mini when removing the ends.So overall...the battery is fine (it's charging so can't comment on capacity. No screen protector and no blue pry-bar like is pictured.
3,Too snug fit.,The fit of the battery is poor because it is wider than the original battery. I had to force mine into place and had to risk breaking my iPod circuit board. The performance of the battery is very good and still holds a good charge after over a year of use. This battery is okay if you are very careful when inserting it into your iPod.
2,CAREFUL,"HAVE I TAKEN THINGS APART IN THE PAST AND THEY WORKED!!You better ask yourself that question before you start or your in deep doodoo. The instructions are very small and you'll need a magnifying glass to read them AND they are not complete!!! Please google taking apart an iPod before you start or you are already in trouble. I didn't disconnect one group of paper thin wires and ruined my iPod BUT I got a better unit (read my reviews).My advice, its cheap BUT you better know what your getting into.."
1,Complete Disappointment,"The performance of this replacement battery is abysmal. Although it is advertised to have a rating of 850 mAh, I barely get 5 hours of play time after a full recharge. By contrast, the original battery had a lower rating of 630 mAh, but it delivered 20 hours of continuous play time when I bought my mini 4 years ago.Another issue is the dimension of the battery, which is a few millimeters wider than the original EC007-5. After the battery was squeezed into place, the circuit board was bent to one side due to the tension buildup by the bigger battery. Although the curvature is small, it caused the LCD screen to press more tightly against the glass panel.In short, I am very disappointed with this product."
1,Applie IPOD Mini battery replacement,"I bought this product to replace the battery which was not lasting less them 30min. Product itself may be fine, but replacing it in mini may be tricky and may damage the unit. Instructions which comes is not for mini IPOD. You will need to send email to vendor to get it or find it on cnet.com for video instruction.I would recommend not spending money to try doing it yourself as you might not get it working after the attempt."
4,Wendell is a romantic Soul balladeer par excellence.,"While neither as powerful nor as intoxicating as his debut CD (1998's ""Make It Good For Ya"") this CD by Wendell Brown has much to recommend it. The absolutely sublime ballads ""Heaven Sent Me An Angel"", ""I Just Don't Understand You"", ""Should We Break Up?"" and ""Can't Get Enough Of Your Love"" (the latter is NOT a remake of the classic Barry White hit) are all throwbacks to the golden era of Soul and should make this CD an essential purchase for any fan of real and heartfelt Soul vocals. There are a few tracks which (unfortunately) have both guest rappers and Hip-Hop influences and undertones which (if you ask me) are truly pointless but this CD does offer (for the most part) irrefutable proof that Wendell is one of the very best male R&B singers of our time."
3,Great Voice !,"Wendell has a great voice but, the songwriting is a little sallow.. does not do him much justice. This guy has the potencial to be a very high caliber singer. The cd was ok but not one that left a lasting impression"
5,Good Times,"A must have for lovers and mellow sounds. Wendell could be the ""new"" Luther Vandross. His voice is smooth, rich and he knows how to work a note. I advise anyone to add this to their library."
2,Too small to be of much use.,"Yes, it's adorable, but this is one tiny backpack. I ordered it for my daughter to use when school starts, but when it arrived, we both realized that it was way too small to try to use to haul her lunchbox or other school stuff. Plus, it feels a little...um...fragile for real use. We decided to get her a ""real"" backpack for school and use the doggie for play at home. The next day, the zipper broke. Bummer. I know I should have read the dimensions more carefully; I'm just posting this review as a heads-up to other shoppers to make sure and check the size so they're not surprised, too."
4,Interesting continuation of Arundel saga,"Lively Lady's protagonist is the son of two of the main characters in the earlier Arundel books: Arundel and Rabble at Arms. While not as epic as either of its precursors, Lively Lady illuminates a little-known episode of this country's history, when our war against Britain in 1812 (in effect a side-action of the Napoleonic Wars) was conducted at sea largely by private vessels licensed by our fledgling government to attack, capture, and destroy Britain's ocean-going commerce.Roberts can come across as a bit stodgy and old-fashioned--and certainly not ""politically correct""--to modern readers, but if you make allowances for his writing reflecting his times, you'll be richly rewarded with fascinating details and great storytelling."
3,"Sjakulc's Opinion of ""The Lively Lady""",This book starts off in Arundel where Captain Mason falls for a young girl maried to a older cold husband. The young captain Mason enters the Revolutionry war but is captured and put in Dartmoor prison. After a sucessfull escape he is caught with the young girl by her husband. He sends the man back to Captain Nason back to jail and has his own wife arrested. Captain Nasoon survives a massacre in Dartmoor prison but is realeased and is reunited with the youg girl.I did not like this book. Not that the book was bad but I do not believe it was good. I'm writing a report on the book and I will try to post it on the internet so I can spare anybody the waste of time in reading this book.Sjakulc Sjakulc Sjakulc Sjakulc Sjaukulc Sjakulc Sjakulc
1,Cheaper is not always better!,"Purchased this product to be able to use my cell phone as a modem and access the Internet through my cellular carrier, Alltel. The software was not compatible with my phone (even though the description said it was) and so is useless to me. I've already placed it in file 13. So I guess I just paid for an extra data cable. Maybe I'll need it one day. Anyway, my brother did the same thing... tried to buy the same software cheaper on the Internet, and his didn't work either. Buy from your carrier. It will cost more but at least it will be guaranteed to work."
2,Not Sure Yet...,"I'm not sure about this cooking method just yet. I've tried two recipes, neither of which was glorious. Both were tasty, but the textures were questionable, especially the rice. I found that a good quality basmati rice came out like a quick or instant rice. I'm still planning to try a pasta recipe, but I'm concerned that it may produce mushy pasta, while we prefer al dente. If the pasta dish doesn't turn out, I think it will be worthwhile to try the recipes with just meat and veggies, adjusting the proportions appropriately. It won't be a one-pot meal, but it will most likely be very good. And if nothing else, my new 2-quart Le Creuset oven that I purchased to try these recipes, is a dream!"
1,"Thank you Douglas County, Colorado, Public Library","I'm just embarrassed that after all my cooking experience I didn't spot how truly awful this cookbook is. I'm ashamed it took two experiments to confirm what I suspected -- YOU CAN'T COOK MEAT OR FISH ALONG WITH FRESH VEGETABLES (OTHER THAN ROOT VEGETABLES) AT HIGH TEMPERATURES AND EXPECT AN EDIBLE RESULT!! I made the Santa Fe Chicken -- ugh! -- and the Scallops and Sweet Potatoes -- even worse. Well, maybe I just tried the two worst recipes. I don't think so. So thanks DCPL for loaning me the book. However, not all is lost: The two-quart Le Creuset dutch oven is about the cutest non-animate thing I ever saw."
5,The joys of one pot cooking,"Finally, an author got it right - a deceptively simple way to make nutritious, delicious dinners all in one step!I was blown away by the scallops and sweet potato recipes. The potatoes added an unexpected flavor that was just yummy. I served one of them for a dinner party of eight, and it was enormously successful. And so easy! I added French bread and dessert, and there you have it. This style of cooking has encouraged me to take up the art again after many years of takeout. I also love the spiral notebook design, which makes it so easy to use. I've already lined up 6 more recipes to try out on my husband and friends!Susan Rutherford, Denver,CO"
5,"If You're Counting Points (WW), Take a Look....","I received my book last week, and I've made 2 meals from it so far. The first meal I attempted was little overcooked, so I submitted a question on the website. To my surprise, I received a response from the author herself. She gave me great tips to make my next attempt more sucessful.Both meals were bursting with flavor, and you don't feel deprived, thinking that you're eating something light. Most of these meals are low in points on the Weight Watchers system. I also like the fact that global flavors are included. You get a chance to experiment, and really become an intuitive cook.Buy the book - you won't be disappointed!"
5,Well-organized and easy to use.,"Glorious has a different organization than several other cookbooks -- makes it easier to use, and helps out with being practical and flexible with using what I've got in the fridge rather than making some special shopping list for a meal or two. It's clear that all these recipes were tested by the author, but truthfully, I've never followed one to the letter and they turn out great all the same!"
4,A Great Time Saver!,"I've had this book for about a month now and have made quite a few of the recipes included. I found that it was a great time saver as prepping the meal usually takes less than 20 minutes and then the rest is just baking time. There are a variety of meals included and you're sure to find something that sounds good to make. My only complaint would be that a lot of the recipes seems to use the same veggies (potatoes, onions, mushrooms and green beans) but as the author says, you can substite any veggies listed with others you like."
3,No photos,This books has no photos. So I haven't done anything delicious using this book. It would be wonderful if a cook book give some pictures.
5,Glorious and Delicious,We received our cookbook recently and have thoroughly enjoyed the meals and options that this cookbook delivers. We were able to shop on our budget and enjoy a nutritious meal. This is an excellent cookbook and I would highly recommend this to everyone.
4,it's not bad,"For a cheaper model of smoker, this one is ok. It regulates the heat in a range of 225 to 270 for a hot smoke. Don't try to cold smoke unless you pull the element and replace with charcoal. Expect to replace the element at 30 bones plus shipping. I have also dropped the temp by pulling the brinkmann element and using a electric charcoal starter element. For the price it does well and holds a lot of food and has a huge water pan."
3,No Replacement Parts,"I feel the same as the person in the review that I just read.I've got this good looking Brinkman Electric Smoker that the element has gone out on, which I haven't had very long,and I can't find a replacement part."
1,Thank you all who have written in with your comments,"This is the American Way! I WAS considering buying an electric smoker by Brinkmann, but after seeing so many broken heat elements, forget it! It would be nice to not have to worry about running out of gas, charcoal is a pain to work with, but this sounds the worst of all."
1,use with caution,"Just a word of caution to those purchasing this item. Mine set my deck on fire last night. I usually smoke on my brick walk, but last night I did it on my deck and it smolderred underneath"
1,Bent Out of Shape,"I would have loved to have tried out this product. However, it arrived in a mangled box... twice. Apparently this is not the best product to ship through the mail. I returned the damaged original and received a damaged replacement in return."
3,D-Day Revisited,"If you want to know about every place involved in the D-Day landings and every monument and museum that has been put up since, this is the book for you. Clear text describes each area involved in the battle with pictures of the many monuments. This detail was both a strength and a weakness. I bought the book because I will have a short time to visit the site and wanted to know where to go. The book made little effort to emphasize which sites were must-sees and which were not, although, if you read the entire text through, you can get a good idea of what are the best places to visit. Although I thought that the forest was lost for the trees to some degree, this is compensated for by the degree of detail provided. There are many interesting stories of individual soldiers. Although a large scale map is provided as an insert, I also think that the book would benefit from more maps included with the text showing greater detail."
4,a Good Introduction,"while there is a Whole new era of ears who know Isaac Hayes through mainly southpark,there is alot more to His Great Talent as a Songwriter,arranger,producer,vocalist&multi-instrumentalist.this is a good start even though quite a few of the tracks are edited.His Shaft Soundtrack along with His Black Moses Era Material is some of His Greatest material that He made.check out His songwriting during his Stax days.Isaac Hayes also made some tight remakes as well.very Talented Musician who could make a Groove go on&on&never losing it's edge."
2,Isaac Hayes- A True Fan's Memoir,"I placed this cd in my cart a month before purchasing it. I purchased it immediately proceeding his untimely death. This cd is for a true Isaac Hayes fan. I do not find this to be a definitive collaboration of his mainstream music. I would have appreciated this cd much more with a few of the dance titles made famous by Mr. Hayes such as ""Zeke the Freak"" and ""I Can't Turn Around"".I will probably end up giving this cd to someone in the future who is a ""die-hard"" Isaac Hayes fan, and maybe if and when I listen to and view this 2 disc cd with a bonus dvd, end up keeping it for myself!"
2,Did not work.,I saw no difference from using this product. Fleas did not seem bothered by it at all yet alone killed. I do not think it killed one flea.
3,cute and inoffensive,This music is appropriate for loyal fans of the Sound of Music and for young children. I don't think these four would survive as a professional performing group without the advantage of their grandparents' name -- their singing is pleasant but not memorable.
5,The Von Trapp Children Vol 1,The item was exactly as discribed and arrived in good condition. I would gladly buy from this seller again...anytime!
2,disappointing,"I was dubious about buying a TV-show soundtrack,but I'm a big fan of latin, brazilian and arabic musics and the reviews were persuasive so I decided to try it. Too bad. This is world music-lite, easy-listening with a mid-eastern flavor. Despite a few authentic voices occasionally mixed in, there is way too much violin sweetener, equal temperament tuning, western chord progressions and 4/4 rock-derived drumbeats. Serious fans of Mid-eastern or latin/brazilian music should definitely skip this CD."
5,A MASTERPIECE,"This CD compiles the best music from the Brazilian soap opera, O Clone. The sound and rhytm are beautiful, and the lyrics are full of meaning. My favorite song is Mirage, which is Jade and Lucas theme song. It's so perfectly composed that it never gets old. If you love O clone music, like I do, then you have to get this CD, you won't regret it."
1,price too good to be true,the price was too good to be true. the batteries won't hold a charge for more than a couple of days. don't bother.
2,Cost was good; performance poor.,"The batteries fit the charger and the camera and charged fine but the battery life was very disappointing. One battery lasted for only 12 pics and the other showed a low charge icon immediately after charging and placed in the camera. Price was good, performance not good. Maybe the life of the battery will improve after several charges but my experience so far indicates I will need to try another supplier."
4,Another winner from Melissa & Doug,My 4 yo son loves playing with this puzzle. The box and the pieces are thick enough to be durable and not get bent easily.
5,Pirate Puzzle,Bought this one a couple of years ago. Good quality puzzle and fun to put together. This one was played with for a long while before we lost a piece. Good value and I do recommend.
3,The art makes me wince,"Good: four year old pirate loves this puzzle; fairly durableBad: Lots of brown areas that make it more difficult but not in a challenging way, just in an annoying way; weird sense of perspective ""why is the pirate a giant?""Ugly: I don't understand why M&D; has such horrible artwork for their puzzles. Just...bad. Don't children deserve good quality art as well? M&D; as a company just has a terrible aesthetic sensibility."
4,"Fun, colorful puzzle. Great for little hands ready for harder puzzles.","My 4-year old son has had this puzzle for three weeks, and probably assembled it 15 times already. He absolutely loves it and can do more and more of it without adult help each time. We had several of Melissa and Doug's 48 piece floor puzzles and they were becoming easy for him. This was a great transition--the floor size of the puzzle is the same, but the pieces are about half the size, and the design is a little more complex. As with all M&D puzzles, the glossy finish and thick, sturdy pieces make them easy to handle, and hard to damage."
5,Two boys' review: Share the treasure with this floor puzzle,"Melissa and Doug floor puzzles are very popular in our household. This particular puzzle, on the heels of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy, is one of their favorites.We have two children, both younger than 6-years old, and highly recommend this puzzle for kids of the same age. The pieces are easy for young children to handle and the puzzle is very durable after repeated uses."
3,off gasses like crazy,"The puzzle is great, but the smell from the ""easy-clean"" surface is overwhelming.As soon as I opened the box, I reeled back from the chemical/plastic smell. I admit to being an earthy-crunchy, natural-product kind of person, so you can take my comments about the chemical off gassing as you will. But I won't be buying another ""easy-clean"" puzzle, myself.As for the puzzle itself, it's too challenging for a 4-year-old child to do on his own, but it's in the right ballpark. My son could help me by putting together all the pieces with pearls for the treasure chest and that sort of thing. Personally, I would guess it would be best suited to a 6 or 7 year old.The finished size is 2 feet by 3 feet, and the individual pieces are about 3 inches across."
5,Great Puzzle,My son loves puzzles and at the age of 6 he was able to put the puzzle together without any problems.The puzzle is constructed very well and should last a very long time.
5,Two thumbs WAY!! up!,"First of all if you want some real country with influence by legends such as Johnny Cash, Josh Turner is ""your man"". Not only does he have a deep (you can't help but listen) voice, he's also great looking. His songs are ear turning and toe tapping."
5,Old school country with a modern sound,This is one of my favorite country CD's. Not since Garth Brooks have I been so excited over the quality of EACH song on the CD.
5,"No Such Thing As ""Sophmore Slump""","WOW!! That is the first thing that comes to my mind after listening to Josh Turner's latest. He has taken that smooth, deep baritone voice to a whole new level. The fact that he also wrote or co-wrote 5 of the songs on this album just proves how deep his connections to country music go. If you want to know anything about Josh, just listen to ""Way Down South"", you couldn't get more of a look into his upbringing unless you were there with him. For those of you who like ""Your Man"", you're going to love ""Would You Go With Me"". All I can say is, you better get a copy of this one fast, because it is sure to be a new classic."
3,"Great voice but that's all, folks","I was attracted to Josh Turner's music by his deep, vibrant voice. In this album I listen to ""Your Man"" and ""Would You Go With Me"" over and over again, partly because as a man in love I can relate to the feelings there. ""Me and God"" could've been great but for the other singer's ridiculously weak voice. The rest of the album I found quite so-so, except Loretta Lynn's Lincoln which I consider the epitome of absurdity."
4,Pretty Good,The cd is pretty good. Not the best. I guess maybe I need to hear some more of his material before making a decision.
5,Another Platinum,"""Your Man"" is the long-awaited follow up CD to Josh Turner's debut album ""Long Black Train."" This new CD is bound for PLATINUM! Josh's deep voice, often compared to Randy Travis is quite evident throughout many of the songs. The album features a variety of songs. If you are a sucker for love songs,there are quite a few. It is too hard to choose a favorite song on this album. Josh paired with John Anderson to sing ""White Noise"" and any good ole' country gal or guy surely will be stomping their cowboy boots to this tune! Another song on the album ""Would You Go With Me"" is bound for radio and has a bluegrass feel to it, and Josh hit's some of those familiar low notes in this one and will have the ladies swooning. Josh also teamed up with Dr. Ralph Stanley and Diamond Rio to sing ""Me and God."" This CD features some of today's finest country music. It was certainly well worth the wait!"
4,Your Man,"I really enjoy this cd. I initially bought it for ""Your Man"" and ""Would You Go With Me"" but I have come to love several of the other songs."
5,Terrific Turner,"Another Excellent album by Josh Turner!!He sticks to his country roots with this album. The rhythms stay in your memory long after listening. His vocal range is amazing and his guest singers add character to the songs. I loved his previous album, ""Long Black Train."" and this one is right up there in quality. I think he should have won a grammy for either of his last two albums."
3,First Josh Turner CD,A friend suggested I get the CD. His music is growing on me. For a first purchase of his music I do enjoy it. Will probably buy another down the road.
3,Now I Have The Whole Series,"I did not order two copies of this. Instead I got two copies each of Lost in Space, Season 2, volume 1 and 2 along with Season 3, volume 1. I'm glad I have one of each for each season.. I never ordered of.2 of each. If I wasn't such a die-hard fan, I would have returned all of these because of the lousy quality. For example, just try watching, on an empty stomach prefferably , season 3 volume 2 and see if you don't feel like a fool for shelling out $20.00 for this mess. It looks like it was transffered by a eight year old.intern at 20th Century Fox.P.S. I'm also returning a smart phone charger I did not order that was just sent to me out of the blue."
3,"Glad to see it out there but where's ""Time Tunnel""??","While I'm glad to see ""Lost In Space"" slowly making its way to DVD, where on earth is the box set of Irwin Allen's other long awaited TV series, ""The Time Tunnel""?? First we were told it would be out last October/November but then all rumors and information dried up. If anyone knows anything about this, please let me know. Thanks!Scott in NJ, USA"
5,the good old days,I always watched this show every week and it was something to look forward to when I was younger. It sure broght back a lot of memories.
4,Dr. Smith and the Robot go camp,"the second season vol. 1 is not as good as vol. 2 which has better stories and less cheezy monsters. but i really enjoyed it anyway. the color is magnificent, the stories are passable, the highlights are Dr. Smith & the Robot. it's funny, the first half of the second season, Dr. Smith is still willing to desroy the Robinsons without a concience. in the second have the doctor is a bit more sympathetic towards Will and the Robot, there are a few tearful farewells when Smith and the Robot are supposed to be leaving for good. all the while the rest of the Robinsons, except Don, let Smith do anything he pleases and barely say anything. the Robinsons are way too serious, the Robot, Dr. Smith and Will carry the camp. i can't wait for season three since this show is becoming as addictive as it was when i was a kid."
3,The Smith Family Robinson in Space,"I bought this series because I remembered it from my childhood and thought it would be a fresh alternative to the repulsive programming currently on broacast TV. I've NOT been dissappointed. Both my 12 girl and 10 year old boy are crazy about it. The first episode actually has the family praying in the face of great danger, as in the original movie and book: ""The Smith Family Robinson"". They really enjoy the zany Dr. Smith and the Robot. Dr. Smith's many foibles give us plenty of fodder for family discussions on character. One downside is that the monsters are somewhat ""cheezy"" and low budget but the plots are creative and entertaining. A good alternative to modern TV. We won'tlet cable TV in our house. There's no need and the downside has become frightening."
5,UK Disc extras and Season 3,"Just to clarify that the UK season 2 box does contain a few extras on Disc 8, but they are not mentioned anywhere on the packaging.They consist of a few radio interviews from the era and a slideshow is displayed as they are playing - lasts about 20 mins.By the way I have just placed my pre-order for the complete season 3 which is released on 10th January 2005 in the UK. Can't wait!"
1,STUDIO`S GREED,The reason for releasing the second season in two volumes is pure greed. Ultimately the studios will destroy their own market once enough consumers realize what their marketing strategy is.Believe me I know alot about the studios and the greedy f&#%s that own them.
1,Why are they only releasing half the season?,This has to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard off. NO other series was done like that. Give me a break!!!(I gave it the lowest rating because of the release of only half the season).
2,Oh the Pain... the pain.,"G'Day from down under!!! Now listen, mate... first they release the complete first season, then while everyone eagerly awaits the release of season two, we're all told it's going to be released in two parts.... hello!? They say there are 4 discs in the second season..RUBBISH. If you buy THE COMPLETE second season from the UK, there are 8 discs containing 30, yes THIRTY episodes in the second series and rumour has it there will be a further releaase in January 2006. Not to mention the packaging that leaves the region 1 partial release for dead. So the mind boggles as to why the boffins at FOX are going to split up season 2 and 3 into small chunks... Oh the pain, the pain..."
5,a great show of the 60's,"i purchased season 2 vol 1. its in color. not black and white. the picture and sound quality is great. there is no play all. just a menu to choose what episodes you want to watch. all shows are on one side of the disc. which is great. but my favorite episodes are on season 1, season 2 vol 2 and season 3. this was worth the buy to see what i was getting. before i got the first season. fox sure did a good job for giving us great quality. maybe after there done with all 3 seasons. it would probably be all in one box set."
2,Thanks Fox for the Customer Appreciation,"It was bad enough FOX never released all seasons of Mary Tyler Moore as originally planned but now deviding up seasons? The studio is looking out for everyone except the customer and that is really ashame. I will purchase the whole set from the UK.I am looking forward to getting the entire season in ONE Box.I really enjoyed this show growing up.This show, Star Trek and Batman were my favorites. Two down and one to go."
2,2 stars for Season 2 and Fox's stupid decision,"Personally, Season 2, which was the most campy and had the weakest story-lines (to compete with the similar lame ""Batman""), was the most disappointing of the three seasons. Season 2 went more into science-fantasy instead of science-fiction. Irwin Allen realized that too, I think, and went back to more of a science-fiction theme in Season 3, but not to the extent it was in the inaugural season. I was retunctantly going to buy Season 2 so that I would have a complete collection. However, Fox's unsuppported and illogical decision to split Season 2 into two volumes, has made me postpone my decision to buy Season 2. I've never heard or seen such a thing. I hope Fox releases a decision as to why American buyers are being subjected to this version verses UK buyers, who are not. Unfair! I may just wait and purchase Season 3 and forego Season 2. Just seems too much of a hassle and effort to have to wait and buy two sets for Season 2."
2,"Grumble, grumble - UK fans fared better with LIS Season Two","Another twist to disgruntle LIS fans, who really wanted LIS Season Two in a single complete second season DVD set. Why is the Season Two Vol 2 set selling for more on Amazon than the Season Two Vol 1 set? In total, buying the two separate Season Two sets are more expensive together than the single Season One set was at issue. That is just what many buyers feared would happen. Enough said. I'm fortunate to have a multi-region DVD player, so I bought the single box Season Two set from the United Kingdom release. It's great."
4,Regarding the Quality,"In regards to the reviewer who wants a cleaner transfer without interlace lines. Most of these library releases only go back to the best original video masters. The best case for the color episodes would be D1 component masters. Then, tape to tape digital clean up if needed. Cheap cleanup ads digital noise though. It's too expensive to retransfer all the original film. The market isn't that big.Now let's get Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea released!Oh the pain!"
5,AR is truly the best,"Record can be a very provocative magazine that might encourage a person to actually go out and try 'Architecture'. Luckily I am an Architecture Major, but for those who are simply browsing to see which mag they are going to get into next. Trust me you definately want to read this one. It motivates your body, it stimulates the designer inside of each and every one of us; as well as it encourages us to stop by a building and look at it as more than wood or steel put together with nails, but a form of relieving the designers that we all are. You'll learn to appreciate the home that you live in and as well bring out the dream house that we always wanted to life in some instances. From Corbu to FLW to Gerhy or from 'Falling Waters' to the 'Disney Concert Hall' AR will represent the best and only the best. This way we know what is good and what is not. So trust me if it is not in this magazine, it's not what you want to go out and see."
1,No Magazine yet and No Service that cares!!!!!,"Order the magazine directly from publisher if you want to get it... I'm in my second attempt via Amazon's magazine dept to find out where the magazine is. Ordered in December and should have received it at latest on Feb 6. Today is Mar 22.Just got off the phone with synapse mag svc, they're going to have someone call me in 3-5 business days to complete a ""customer service action form"". Them I'm sure there'll be another several days wait for them to find out they screwed up, fix the problem and tell me I'll get my magazine in 6-8 weeks.If I ever get the magazine, maybe I'll review it here next time."
3,I have no idea,"I would like to tell you that this is an amazing publication, but I don't have an opinion on it. Mainly because it's taking forever for the first issue to arrive. The funds have long ago been deducted but I have nothing to show for it. If you don't mind waiting forever and a day, go for it. If you'd like to receive it in a reasonable amount of time, look for it at a newsstand."
2,Did not fit,We looked up the belt by our model numer but it did not fit. We decided just to replace the whole vacuum..
1,Eureka belts,"We bought the vacuume cleaner from Costco less than a year ago,and the belts break every so often. I wonder why. We never had to change belts when we were using Hoover's."
3,not as good as i remember,"I think his life could've been made into a better, more interesting movie. This was like a fantasized, dramatic documentary. Just went through his life, but didn't even really live true to who he really was (apparently, the special features helped me with this opinion). It was kind of interesting, and touching at times, but also boring and unimaginative."
1,2 hours of Peter Sellers bashing,"It may be true that Peter Sellers was a difficult person, but this film only focuses on the bad things about him and rarely, if ever shows what a huge talent and phenomenal person he was. It's a shame that people might see this movie, without having first seen Dr. Strangelove, Lolita, The Mouse That Roared, and/or Being There. This movie might mislead people into thinking he had no redeeming qualities."
2,"love peter sellers, hate this film","Peter Sellers next to Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd is the best example of comedic talent in the world. This film however paints him as a sad sex induced loser. A role he is not. If so, he should be portrayed in a more sympathetic way."
3,Interesting...you'll learn something,"I learned what an ass Peter Sellers was. This moving is great and another good thing that comes out of HBO. Rush is awesome and takes to Sellers and his character well. It's a good 2 hours, even though there are some 'far-out' scenes."
1,Not the same,"The product is not the same as displayed on the picture, its more like fake silicon boobs that you slap on to ur chest, it doesnt even have a back. If you sweat its going to fall off to the floor."
2,I Knew it was to good to be true,"When I purchased this item, I thought, what a great deal.My son gets it, plugs it in, and it works fine for about 3 days!First buttons start poppin off then the joystick control breaks. I think it was made poorly!"
5,Bought for one song,"I bought this for one song ""Lakme Flower Duet"" but was surprised at how much I enjoyed the whole CD. Arrived in a timely and efficient manner."
5,Looks ain't everything...,"What's not to love? A pair of great looking ladies singing great music, and adding their own touch in the harmonies. I just love harmony. As their name suggests, this is not meant to be serious music, and this time I like that idea. It just sounds good. What else do you need?"
1,a mockery of opera,"I really don't recommend purchasing this CD. My biggest fear is that a customer who is new to opera may buy this CD and think that these tinny voices are what opera is about. In my opinion, the sloppy, commercialized remixes are a mockery of all the beauty opera possesses. The ""Babes'"" voices are terrible, too...poor technique and no ring. If you'd like to listen to some opera, try Puccini."
2,Hmmm,"From a classical vocalist's perspective, I was fairly appalled. I have never thought of myself as an opera snob per se, but I really didn't understand this album. I was listening to the Flower Duet, which I have performed many times. Not only did I not think their voices blended as well as they should, but the disco beat--which could be an interesting feature, I will admit--didn't even line up with the music. I don't know, I don't want to completely write off the entire ""popera"" genre, because as a hopeful opera singer, I hope this will draw people towards a greater appreciation of opera as an art form. But the disco beats combined with Lakme just sounds contrived, not honest."
2,Sloppy renditions and amateurish,"I heard one of the selections on Sirius and liked it so I bought the CD. Upon hearing the entire CD I was disappointed that the only selection I liked was the one that prompted me to buy the product. The voices are nice but they are simply adding voice to opera masterpieces that do not fit. They are certainly not of the caliber of Sarah Brightman or Charlotte Church and don't look for that. Their sound is mellow, dim and without the emotion that does an inservice to the opera pieces they sing. I found the CD lackluster and in all honestly very ""amateurish""."
2,Good Voices - Heavy Arrangements,"The story's great - who doesn't love the Liza Doolittle-like twist. The singing's good - these ""babes"" are obviously talented and well-trained - but the arrangements overpower and distract from their singing. Hope they get to make another album that displays their singing a lot better."
3,Just a bit on the cheesy side,I really wanted to love this album but I could not get over the hokiness of it. Even my kids (ages 12 and 9) got a bit of a chuckle when they heard it. Not all of the songs are bad but it just does not make the crossover successfully.
5,Surprising Impressive,"Someone else besides Sarah Brightman is taking up the ""remade"" classics genre.They both have lovely voices... but what really steals the show are the arrangements. I loved the song they created out of the Greg Piano Concerto 2nd movement. The La Wally Aria sounds wonderful as a duet. My other favorites are the Dvorak and Morricone arrangements. I also really enjoyed ""Remember Me"".Most of the arrangements are not ""pop"" sounding at all. They stayed relatively true to most of the original music... just given it a fresh sound."
3,A familiar duo from World Cup 2002!,"Many people might remember Karen England (mezzo soprano) and Rebecca Knight (soprano) from their preformance of the official ITV Sorld Cup 2002 theme song ""Un bel di"" from the opera Madame Butterfly.The CD is well done and the variety of operatic compositions chosen for this album are quite good. This is the perfect gift for someone just becoming familiar with Opera and it's refined musical genre.Very good indeed.....recommended."
3,wallpaper,"overorchestrated, overproduced aural wallpaper...that said, still, these women have wonderful voices and are worth hearing. They are oversold,too...Opera Babes! Indeed. Folks who like Enya will like this."
5,Excellent pen,"I need a pen like this during the cold weather. The rubber grip really sets it apart from the other space pens. Light weight, but sturdy."
3,Ehh,tried using them.. and maybe i just dont know how.. but i almost set my hair on fire and they didnt seem to actually get anything out..
3,Hilarious!!!,"Me and my mom used these when we got them in last night. I read reviews how they are good to use every 6 months and helps with hearing and people who have bad sinus problems. Well my moms 58 and sometimes we have to scream when we talk to her. In reality i just think she has selective hearing =) But she was scared to do it alone so i did mine with her. It just feels warm and you could hear your ear wax sizzle.The hilarious part was my mom was so busy laughing at me do mine when she went to cut the fire out a part flew and caught her hair on fire. It was an overall hilarious experience. I dont know if it worked or not, but a bit of wax sure did come out of each ear. My hearing seems the same. What i would highly recommend this for is for people with ear infections, i think it would help it feel a lot better and also people who have hurt ears from long flights and stuff. Either way hilarious experience at a good price =) ~ Thanks guys!"
1,Ear Candle scam,"I was undere the impression that this product would clean out my ears. It did nothing of the sort, so I would never bother with this item again. I'll just simply go see a doctor to have my ears cleaned."
2,Be careful,A little scary to use... the flames got pretty big. We will not be buying these again and will stick to using Q-tips to clean our ears.
1,Dissappointed,"Very disappointed in the purchase. I knew the product was not new but it was advertized that it was in good condition. I could not play the disc because of the constant skipping. This had to be know by the seller and yet it was sold anyway. Of course the money was refunded, but it should have never been advertized or sold."
3,Nice but untrue,"A good book but it had some untrue parts, like with her sister Mary. In this book Mary was a terrible cheater, NOT TRUE!! Mary was a kind girl and sister. Plus it was at times boring and long. To me this book wasn't my type, unfortunetly. However there WERE some nice parts. I'd reccomend it as a 2nd or 3rd, Thanks"
