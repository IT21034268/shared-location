5,I Hate Ann C0ulter ...,"i have only read part of this book so far. It throws light on the biases of far right critics in the media toward liberal and progressive analysis of things as they are in the current Bush regime, using derogatory language frequently. There are several books of this nature shedding light on this slanderous (?) activity, a sign that we are learning more of this attack by the right. This book fits well in this process of analysis!"
4,"Some great ""talking points"" for liberals.","Whats interesting about many of the books which come out about these people is that most of them are books of humor. This book should be seen as more of the same. In essence, the subjects of these books are so depraved that they can only be discussed in a humorous light. It is a bit scattered in its format but has some good points that the open minded reader can take with them...if they must talk to a conservative."
2,A Disappointment,"I read this book hoping to see some lively jousting between some of the obnoxious neocons and those they ""savage"" (excuse the pun) on the air. Unfortunately the humor was only an ""Oh, yeah?"" response that, though many times managed to hit the mark, was little more than embarrassingly defensive and bitter. The only way to succeed against people like Limbaugh and Coulter is to use their tactics. Many neocons want constructionist judges interpreting the Constitution, yet they'll produce Patriot Acts that would have the framers turning in their graves and arbitrarily suspend habeas corpus in emergencies which they themselves define.I was hoping to smell the sweet aroma of hypocrisy in this book, yet strangely, I still sensed fear on the parts of the contributors. This will never do. Until they can make these guys (and gals) eat what they dish out, books like this will be only weak, ineffectual strikes."
1,My Moluccan cockatoo loved this book,"It's another leftist ""I Hate"" book without any substance or intellectual value...this book is nothing but leftist hate....One star is way too good for this book, glad I didn't pay any money for it..."
1,Toilet Tissue,Why would I shell out over twelve bucks for this book when I can purchase a roll of Scotts-tissue for less than a Dollar?!?
1,Pathetic Sub-Moron rants and raves,"Absolute trash. No intellectual content whatsoever. I can't believe a publisher would waste paper to print such utter rubish. Author is a pathetic with a huge chip on his shoulder with nothing whatsoever to offer a society of rational people. Don't waste your time or money.11/22/08 At the present time 33 says it crap and 19 say its good. Many listers are willing to part with it for anywhere from a penny to a dollar. I think that tells you that it willnot only never be a collectors item, but the poor people who own it want to unloaded for next to nothing - more that it's actually worth in my opinion. I actually wouldn't sell it or even give it away to my worst enemy.I used mine to start a fire. It was reasonably good for that."
1,not surprised....,"Not suprising liberals come up with this in order to try and silence some of the rare good Americans we have to speak out in true support of our great country. The author even uses ""HATE"" blatently, which only shows how blind the twisted perspective is. I know the conservatives like Savage and Coulter are definitely not liars and actually have the right plan America needs for adequate terrorist protection. Its also funny, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh etc do not actually hate mentally ill liberals like author Clint Willis hates what he doesnt agree with, but they are actually trying to help and change why exactly these people(extreme left) act in this suicidal, destructive and absolutly antiAmerican way of thinking."
3,Funny Stuff,"It appears many reviewers from both the right and left of the political spectrum took this book a little too serious. It's humor. It's entertainment. Rush, Ann, Bill, Sean, Savage and so on are more about entertainment value rather than real political insight. Much of the same applies to Franken, Moore and others on the opposing side. Pure sensationalism. Actually most of the reviews posted on amazon were a f'n laugh out loud riot. Recommended for readers who can take a joke."
1,"If America's Conservatives are Being Attacked and Whined About by Liberal Bloggers,",Then they must be doing something right.
1,Liberals Hate themselfs!!!,"This book shows you exactly why liberals are so full of hate. I encourage everyone especially conservatives to buy this book and use it for a guide to understand the logic of a sick mind. Also this will help Clint become a part of the most hated class of people of all, the upper class!"
4,Cool,"This book is a collection from newspapers, magazines, other books and some author commentary. This book goes over conservative ""pundit's"" viewpoints and does fact checking on them. I thought this book would be written by the author as a story in a funny way (like Michael Moore's books or Al Franken's). Instead though, the author goes into detail about the people who make up conservative ""pundit's"" fan base. Some myths are debunked and facts are checked.Hopefully a time will come when we can have some real news instead of one-sided media propaganda i.e. Fox News Channel. It would also be nice to take racists - Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage, hate & fear mongers - BushCO, Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity and perverts- Bill O'Reilly of the air and mainstream.How hypocritical of people to say: ""the titles mean, it says hate"". I guess when those people listen to Savage and Limbaugh use slurs against gays, Muslims, Native Americans, women, etc. they think that is different, it is not ""hate""."
1,The Obvious Jealous book,"WOW i didnt bother reading this garbage book but i can already tell that its another jealous liberal its funny how all of O'reillys, coulters, and other intelligent conservative books sell much better than the left wing hate books i bet this book didnt sell 5 copies while Bold Fresh has been on the best sellers list since it debuted lol"
1,Laughing out loud,"This book is one of the funniest I have ever read because it is truly ""Progressive liberalism"". Absolutely nothing new. Bash, bash, bash Conservatives. Use of hate speech, which liberals go crazy over if it is use against one of their sacred cows. Trying and trying to rewrite the Constitution, something they have never studied or learned what the framing fathers thought when they wrote it.I offer no excuse for George W. who is no conservative, but if liberals offer no more than this which they don't, Republican's will keep getting elected. I like most Conservative's long for another true Reagan."
1,Disappointing,"I really thought I would like this book, but it's just not written very well. I was very disappointed and had to put it away after reading more than two thirds of it. Most high school students can write better."
5,swahili favourite,this cd has been very popular in kenya and east africa.its like the boys to men standard music but in swahili
1,"MISSING PARTS FROM NEW, NEVER OPENED BOOK","I've never written a review before because I have always had good luck with my orders. This time I bought a $150 NEW book basically because it had a CHARM and NECKLACE in the front of it. To mu surprise, no charm, no necklace. Since the book had never been opened I assumed that the order would be complete, wrong. What do I do with a NEW book with missing parts that are the reason I ordered the book in the first place? I am very dissapointed in this site for sending out an incomplete order that cost alot. Any suggestions? By the way, I can't really use the book without the missing pieces."
3,Sounds which emanate from 75 years back.,"The signals recorded on this CD are from the thirties; the aural rendition therefore leaves much to be desired. Nevertheless the harpsichordist has been a major figure regarding the instrument and its music, and certain aspects of his interpretation are detectable inspite of the degraded quality of sound. There are notes to this effect included in the CD."
3,"All in all, not bad","Strait Up is a success in the long run, but there are songs that just sucked or didn't belong.For example, is it really nescessary for Fred Durst to plug Limp Bizkit yet again in a song dedicated to the passing of Lynn Strait, even when LB isn't even playing on the recording. And the lyrics are pathetic. Not a bad song, but Fred did a terrible job at the lyrics. They are laughable.And the song with Mark McGrath from Sell-out Ray kinda sucks too. ""Catch A Spirit"" with Max Cavalara is okay, but not Soulfly quality. Brandon Boyd's song is ""eh."" And Serj's song is suprisingly not good. The rest are pretty good.Highlight tracks include 2,3,8,11. Jon Davis, M.C.U.D, Lajon Witherspoon, and Corey Taylor did the best jobs.The unreleased Snot song ""Absent (13) is pretty good, but not astonishing.If your a fan of Snot, or some of the lead singers from other bands on this recording, its a decent buy. Otherwise, ""Eh"""
5,I love this CD.,This is such a good cd. I'd give anything if it didn't have to exist though. My personal favorite is Reaching Out by Mark. They're all right behind it though.
1,Pretty boring and forgettable,"I sold this album after owning it for a week, because I was beginning to break out of the confines of nu metal worship. I realized that 1)Snot was really not a very amazing or enjoyable band and 2) Lynn Strait was a pretty unremarkable individual and a mediocre frontman/songwriter. Its obvious the guy was popular amongst his friends, but ultimately this tribute probably sounded better to the people who participated in the album itself rather than listeners. The standout is ""Angel's Son"", though Lajon Witherspoon writes some pretty cheesy lyrics(Dude, what does your daughter have to do with Lynn?)he does a fine job and the acoustic guitars are pleasing to the ear.Oh well, the nu metal's domination is long over anyways."
5,Loss for Words,"Only recently did i learn what a great man and frontman James Lynn Strait was. But i was too late. Just wanted to let everyone know this is an incredible album, get it right away.RIP Lynn and Dobbs, we all love and miss you."
3,"Pretty good, but...","...the idea of a tribute album featuring Strait's friends was a brilliant one imo. It is well exectued for the most part by Serj of SOAD, the guys from Sevendust, John Davis from Korn, and Boyd from Incubus. Other than that, other tracks dont' really stand out. However, Fred Durst of Limp spoils it all and writes a song that disgraces Lynn in every way. His lyrics, much like his new album is trash. Throughout his song, Forever, he uses un-necessary profanity and also for some reason says ""Limp Bizkit FOREVER"". It does no just to a man that had just died tragicly to have this piece of you-know-what FD ruin his album."
4,Almost There,"The Deathray Davies are one album away with this release. It's a darker sounding disc than there next one (just check the title), but still full of the hooks they do so well. However, it's not as catchy or instantly rewarding as 2005's The Kick and the Snare. Still, you can't go wrong with DRD."
2,Slightly disapointing,"I've bought this candy many times before, although this is my first purchase from this vendor, and might I say the first time I was disapointed. They were edible, but far from fresh. Harder than usual, and slightly stale - My first Amazon disapointment. I'll buy these elsewhere in the future, thank you."
5,Licorice Chips,I hadn't had any of these in over 20 years. These are just as delicious as the ones I used to get. I am delighted to have found a source for them again.Chips Licorice Jujubes 1lb
3,Better than the average but still not the definite book on Vermeer,It is a nice book but the quality of the reproductions is poor.
3,Mediocre reproductions,"I was wrong to say that the tall Harry Abrams Vermeer book, ""The Complete Works"", was inadequate. It is far better than the reproductions contained here or in the Blankert book. Abrams' prints are clear, intense and, above all, not washed out. Most of the prints here and in the Blankert book are washed out or blurry. True, ""A Lady Reading"" is too dark in Ambrams, so we can't see the drapery or the picture on the wall, and ""Servant Handing a Letter to Her Mistress""(one of the greatest) has colors that have run, but on the whole the quality of Abrams is far better. And, the book is less expensive. You lose the long-winded, predictable commentaries, but you'll never miss them."
5,Intermatic NE200C - Great product,"I had 3, 100 watt incandescent flood lamps that were controlled by a regular intermatic photo controller (on at dusk, off at dawn).In an attempt to save on electricity usage, I tried a CFL in one of them.It just kept rapidly cycling on & off. Regular photo controllers apparentlyaren't designed to handle CFLs.The 3 NEC200C controllers I ordered work great and I'm now saving significant money on electric bills."
2,a good beginner bible for a toddler,"This is a very nice small child's first Bible. It covers some main events and a few notable people from the Bible. I read it to my oldest child when she was a toddler. There are cartoonish pictures, and Bible events and people are introduced in a first person narrative. For example, ""Hi. I'm Abraham. ....etc.."" I bought several of these to give to 3 year olds from Vacation Bible School who did not have their own Bible at home. In my opinion, nothing matches the original Bible, and children should be taught it as early as possible, but this is helpful for little bitty ones. Hearing things from a first person perspective is a nice change of pace to little ears."
1,NO TABLE OF CONTENTS,"A very good book and the worst possible kindle edition. The problem? Well, imagine that you would like to read that bit in chapter five that you liked so much. Because there is no links in the table of contents you have to go manually through all the pages until you arrive to the desired bit. Image you would like to review a procedure again you have to go there manually. What is the purpose of having a kindle edition if it does work properly? AVOID THE KINDLE EDITION AND BUY A HARD COPY."
2,Buyer beware!,"The uninformed should know that there are several problems with this item. First and foremost, Sousa did NOT compose Under the Double Eagle - it was written by an Austrian bandmaster, Josef Wagner. It was, however, a piece that he played often and recorded several times. Sousa did write the other two dozen items here, including the obscure March of the Mitten Men and Chantyman's March. Second, these recordings, assumed to be of the Sousa band, are in very primitive sound quality (no surprise, since they were mostly made in the 1920's and before) and JPS conducts only a few of them - assistant conductors, including the great trombonist Arthur Pryor, did a lot of that work for him, as he didn't like making recordings. Third, while the playing may have been very good for that era, it is nowhere near the ""state of the art"" today - so this is mostly of historical interest."
3,Charming little family film,"Merlin is a charming family film, what you see is what you get - dragons, battles, good vs evil, etc... I played it for my kids on thanksgiving and they enjoyed it. Jurgen Prochnow is wonderful in everything he is in and this is no exception.One thing though.. the song on the end credits 'Chain of Promise' that Sanya Mateyas sings is particularly awesome...I haven't had any luck finding it online, but it's really great."
4,Pretty Good Movie,I was worried this would be a real stinker but it actually was very entertaining. It is a dragon movie....don't expect any award winning dramatic performances....but very entertaining and watchable.
5,the Gods vs Satanic Ghouls,"A film sequel to the fantasy history world of Merlin. This man is a magician of the secret world who in turn got into this service thru family heredity. If you realize truth/real world/, sorcery/evil-witchcraft, and common sense then you will enjoy this rendition. If there was more portrayal on Arthur's wife Gwenivere, the Lady of the Lake, and Merlin's teacher/soldier of truth; it would be a little more interesting."
2,Merlin and a few others,"Okay this is a cute childrens film. I do recall a few others that I saw as a kid with a handful of actors/actreses, but in this day of larger casts like inBraveheart (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray] you need more than a cast of about ten to impress most adults. I applaud their attempt to make this Arthurian legend come to life and the acting is fair, but next time round up your families, friends, the neighorhood, or use some special effects and spend a little more if you plan to have epic battle scenes. If you enjoyed this you're watching to much late night TV, but tryThe Seventh Voyage of Sinbad (50th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray].CA Luster"
4,The Dark Ages in Britain have begun...,"The Roman Empire ends its occupation of the country, leaving it in turmoil...The Dark Ages in Britain have begun... A time lost to history. A time of legends, of violence and bloodshed... Of Magic and Mythical Creatures...And of a great wizard, named Merlin."
3,"Mis-named, but still interesting","In spite of its title, this is not a book about rabbit control. Ms Drakeford's approach is that of the country person and unquestionably she has a deep knowledge and evident love of some aspects of country life.If you want to know how to hunt, trap or snare rabbits then this book is for you. If on the other hand you are suffering a plague of rabbits then there is little help to be had here.As someone who has spent more then 30 years in pest control I find her dismissive attitude to serious population control measures rather short-sighted. Australia, where I spent many years, would have a much more serious rabbit problem if it were not for control techniques which she dismisses so disparagingly.The book would more be appropriately titled ""Rabbit Harvesting"". In its own way this is an excellent book but it is not for anyone who requires serious pest control."
5,Highly recommend,I am in the process of reading this book and amfascinated by the authors detail description of thetsars. It's wonderful to read a book with substanceand not fluff! I am impressed!
3,Too small,"I am 5'2"" and my feet size 6. I weight about 96lbs, but the twister is still kind of small. Forgot about my husband get on it. There is only one size. Wish it was wider."
5,Great Buy!,I love this thing! It's so light weight and easy to use. It works on any surface and is a great ab workout as well as a thigh work out (if you bend your knees a bit).
1,Do not buy,this product only lasted for three workouts. the item is not very sturdy and not of a high quality. i had a pair of these from gaia which was much better and lasted for years.
3,Balance,"You have to turn slowly or have exceptional balance to stay on the board.Other than that, it is easy to use."
3,"Fun, but less than amazing.","I purchased this item 2 1/2 years ago from Amazon and still use it! I don't do the standard excercise program you would expect, but I use it when I am doing the dishes. Keeping my feet on the small surface while doing something with my hands seems to keep my middle section tighter from trying to balance myself. Mine is still in excellent condition, even with 4 kids who intermittently steal it from the kitchen and use it for entertainment... For the low price tag, I recommend it."
3,Okay Product,This product is a cheap exercise machine. It works great for the price. I got on it and it made a cracking since I weight almost 190lbs. If this product helps me lose weight I will be leaving another review of how great this prodcut works.
3,Not what I wanted,"It is what it says it is, but I thought it was soft on top. You have to be on a hard surface for it to work, and who wants to work out in the kitchen. I don't think it's all it's cracked up to be."
3,Good exercise!,"I used a different brand that was larger before. This is too small...wish they would make it larger, and I am a small woman."
4,i enjoy it,found it to be fun to use i just leave it in the kitchen everytime i go in there i twist for three to five min
3,Twist Board,The product works as advertised. Only wish it was a bit larger. There is not much room for your feet.
2,Looks Better Than It Works,"I've had it for 6 months, but only used it 3 times. I bought this, thinking it would be a fun way to exercise, not realizing that you have to twist back and forth for what feels like FOREVER to get a decent workout. It's not practical to do while watching TV or anything because you tend to spin in a slow circle if you twist harder one way or the other. Plus, it's far too easy to pull a muscle with the repeated turning. It is a much better kid's toy than an exercise tool."
3,Concept sounds good but experience was different,"I bought this and later decided that I can do the same exercise by twisting on my wood floor in a pair of thick socks. The board is hard to stay centered on while watching tv. I had a tendency to drift either 90 degrees left or right and would have to get back on and start over again facing the tv. I also noticed twisting on it for longer than a minute or so gave me the most horrific side stitch which felt like a piercing gas pain in my stomach! Weird...and I am one who is in pretty good physical shape. I bought this because I thought it would be fun, mindless exercise while watching tv. Husband and daughter were right. They said it was a frivolous buy."
4,Kittens on the brain,"Luckily just shy of being unspeakably vulgar, so read it and speak of it. Dreadfully gritty without being utterly grim. Suprisingly hiliarous, especially the bit about falling off the side of the building with a friend on her back, in the process of busting said friend out of a mental hospital. Delphine's unapologetic sexuality, rampant self-violence, love of indie music, and literary ambition all wrap around a kernel of something very akin to inner peace, a glowing self-awareness and strength. Plus, the girl can write the hell out of even a little description of supermarket lighting."
3,It worked ok.,I bought this to try to clear a clog in a windshield wiper jet for my Chevy Trailblazer but it would not clear it. I eventually just found a cheap replacement and changed the part for both sides completely.
5,Just Terrific,"Like many, I remember this album from my late teen years. I gave the album to my girl friend at the time. Its a great choice of instrumental music...some of Paul Mauriat's best. For music from 40 years ago, it sounds super on the high tech equipment of today. I was happy to be able to obtain it on CD. Lots of memories."
3,KINDA DARK OUT HERE,"I HAVE THE ORIGINAL LOVE IS BLUE ALBUM WITH THIS ARTWORK BUT THERE ARE SOME SONGS MISSING . MOST NOTABLY THE FLIP SIDE OF THE ORIGINAL 45 AND ALSO ON THIS ORIGINAL ALBUM , PAULS RENDITION OF THE CLASSIC ""SUNNY""!WHERE THE HECK IS SUNNY? HIS TREATMENT OF THIS GREAT POP SONG WAS ON LEVEL WITH LOVE IS BLUE AND SHOULDA COULDA EASILY BEEN A LITTLE HIT AND NOT TO MENTION PART OF THE NEW AGE MUSIC TODAY!SHUCKS!"
2,Hydrogenated coconut oil,"I was not aware when I ordered this that it contained hydrogenated coconut oil. I thought it would be a combination of cocoa, dry milk, sugar and vanilla. It tasted great. So great, in fact, that we had a second cup and were sitting back and enjoying a leisurely sip and chat on a lazy Sunday morning. I happened to glance on the ingredient list and saw it contained, hydrogenated coconut oil. What a recipe for clogged arteries, high density cholesterol and heart attack potential. If those things don't bother you, go ahead and order a bunch because it does taste teally good."
3,I LOVED It.... Until the batteries died a week later,"I think this product is GREAT, besides the fact that it just eats batteries. Im not sure if its because its an optical mouse or what, but it just eats them alive. As if it matters, the range was amazing, as I was able to operate my computer located in the top floor of my house from down in the basement.I tried buying top of the line rechargeable batteries but it just ate through those in less than a week. Oh well."
5,Worth the investment,"Sure it's more expensive than a traditional corded, non-optical mouse but it's worth it.Very quick and problem less installation on my Win2K Pro system. Four buttons (including wheel) provides all the control surfaces one typically needs. I've never found it lacking in day-to-day work or gaming use.The only two potentially negative aspects are the weight and need to replace batteries. At first it did seem a little heavy (due to the two AA batteries) but after a couple of days of use I don't even notice it now. On replacing the batteries, I use my system ~2 hours every other day and have had to replace the batteries twice in 6 months. Just buy yourself a bulk pack of AA batteries and stick them in your desk, it isn't good if your batteries die and you have none handy."
1,No support.,I'm having trouble with my mouse. I loved and used it for three years. Great device. The thing drains batteries though. I upgraded the software from the logitech website and it would recognize it as a regular two button mouse. Finding help was a pain. No response from the site. Great Support Logitech!
5,Great Mouse,My experience with the logitech mouseman mouse has been a very good one. I find it is easy to use. Overall I think it is the best mouse that I have used.
4,Nice mouse and I dont miss the cord,I purchased the mouse to work with my new XP system and didnt have any problems. XP installed it easily and I was in business. So nice to not have that cord ! Buy it.
4,Great but could be better,"I found this mouse to be a great replacement for my old wired,gummed up ball mouse. It has never lost it's connection and has a fast response time. I gave it 4 stars because I don't like the buttons (right and left). They are too small and should cover the front of the mouse.I plan on getting another one for my office."
3,Thumb button,"Button for your thumb is in the wrong place.Cordless Mousman had it right. Why was it changed?Basically, the Cordless Optical thumb button is slimmer and closer to the desk than the Cordless Mouasman. I get pain from trying to bend my thumb to reach the button."
3,Not as precise,"I got this mouse cause I knew of the preciseness of the optical mice, and I was normally a fan of the Logitech products.But, I do have to say this isn't as precise as I required. For some reason, this mouse does little 0.5 second stalls, almost constantly. Simple test of mine involved moving the mouse in a small 1 inch up/down motion to see where the point ends up.It never stays in place on the screen, but rather at the very top or bottom of my screen eventually. All that time I didn't move the mouse more than 2 inches on my desktop.For an every day use mouse, something that doesn't require as much preciseness, it's a great mouse, but for what I do, it stalled too much for my uses."
2,Great mouse but poor software drivers.,I've bought two Logitech wireless mice as well as their wired mice. In all cases their software drivers on both Mac and Windows have not been able to slow down the cursor movement to a practical speed. It would overshoot due to moving too fast even on the slowest speeds. Finally they came out with some software to nearly completely fix the speed control problem for the older non-wheel mice. This company is apparently making the most money it ever has if you see their financials. Too bad that economic success comes with a bit of blindness to product feature quality. I sure hope they fix this problem since I otherwise like their mice but have lost a lot of money chasing their features when their drivers can't stop erratic behaviors of the cursor.
5,"It's got me, a left-hander, completely satisfied","What I really wanted to use for precision photo-editing was a massive trackball, so I bought the Kensington Turbo Mouse Pro. That is a great trackball. Unfortunately, I found it to be unreliable (one of the rollers soon stops working in one direction) and I returned two of them. The third is still sitting in the box unopened because in the meantime this Logitech Cordless MouseMan Optical came out and I've found it to be so satisfying and precise that I haven't gotten around to unpacking my third Kensington. Who needs to with this? It's extremely accurate and precise and I can set the ballistics precisely with the software so that it zips across the display if I have to move fast and moves a pixel at a time for photoediting when I move it slow. Note also that I am left-handed and do not find that its obvious right-hand orientation is a bother. Got used to its ""funny shape"" for a left-hander in under a minute."
5,Logitech never fails,"Logitech has yet to dissapoint me in the quality of their products. This mouse finally frees you of the cord that always resists your movements. It's a bit heavier than other mice mainly because of the batteries needed in the mouse, but it's definitely worth the extra weight to be free of the cord. The mouse is much more sturdy than the microsoft optical mice, and more comfortable in the hand. This is an excellent mouse for gamers because I haven't notice it skip when the mouse is moved rapidly like other optical mice tend to do. This mouse is THE mouse to get. I would also recommend the Logitech cordless itouch keyboard to round out the cordless desktop."
4,Sticking with ball mouse for now,"I have the non-optical version of this mouse that I bought 1 year ago and love it - I've been cordless for 5 years now, both mice from Logitech. The only jerkiness or problems I've ever had is when the batteries are near death, which is about twice a year. I do a lot of CAD work, and the mouse is very precise. Due to other ratings here, I think I'll hold out for the next generation optical cordless, since this one from Logitech is too small (I tried it in the store), & the MS wireless Intellimouse seems to be full of typical MS bugs."
2,Highly Overrated,"After almost entirely positive reviews, I picked up this product and was very disappointed. First off, the included software crashed my windows XP professional, although Logitech has apparently resolved this issue now.This is the only mouse I have ever used or seen in which the buttons don't go to the edge of the mouse. They are very small and closed off, which made use uncomfortable. The mouse itself is slow and imprecise (ONLY 1500 pictures per second compared to 6000 from Microsoft's new mice) and extremely frustrating when using Photoshop, games, or any demanding app. the unit is overpriced, heavy and the side button is placed awkwardly...I hate to sound like a corporate shill, but the new Microsoft Wireless Intellimouse Explorer, which I now own, is a far superior unit (4x the pictures per second, better DPI, better design and feel, better included software). Sorry Logitech, better luck next time!"
1,not compatible with Windows XP,I had to return this mouse because it wasn't compatible with my computer system: Windows XP
2,OUCH !!!,"This is the MOST ergonimcally unfriendly mouse I have ever used.After using it for just 5 or 6 minutes, I have to shake the cramps out of my hand. It would be a great mouse if it were designed a little better ... but it is literally painful to use!"
2,Paint easily peeled off after only 2 weeks/ not warranted!!,"Seems Logitech knows they did a poor job on the painting so, after only 2 weeks normal office use, try to clean the mouse's palm rest area with a napkin, and guess what, the silver painting comes off and the white plastic shows. :(Talked to Logitech support and descibed it to them, they said ""Oh, you don't like that?"" and then told me ""the paint is not warranted"". I guess because it's cosmetic, but only after 2 weeks? Sounds too soon to me. :("
1,Logitech Cordless MouseMan Optical,Briefly: Easy to install but it ends there. Basically this product functions like a standard mouse that needs a new ball or has to be cleaned. Exasperating trying to get the arrow to land on the spot you select. It wanders and drifts. You'll never score 8000 playing solitaire with this one. I went back to the old mouse that needs to be refurbished. It functions better. Sorry Logitech!
1,PC Integration,"While the Optical mouse may work well, the out of the box install did not work on my standard Dell PC. My guess is that there is an interrupt incompatability. Not wanting to figure this out, I went back to my standard Microsoft mouse. Until Logitech comes out with a 6 step way to take their mouse an adapt it to standard hardware, I would avoid it unless you like messing with your system."
1,THE 9304960403 CORDLESS MOUSEMAN STOP WORKING.,I BOUGHT THIS MOUSE AND IN 2MONTHS IT STOP WORKING.NOT GOOD AT ALL. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING BETTER.
3,some good some bad,"the really cool thing is that the mouse has the fourth button in the lower part, which is not possible to find in the new models (and it's a lot more ergonomic, as you don't have to raise your thumb to use it). but the design of the mouse body is somewhat not fitting a comfortable position of the hand on the mouse. in the same time, you have to pay attention to the compatibility of this mouse with the newer operating systems (since this is an older model and doesn't have updated drivers for the most current systems)."
3,Eats Batteries,"This thing really goes through batteries. Even when not in use, the red light inside still glows slightly, indicating that the batteries are slowly being drained.Removing batteries after each us prolongs battery life, but it's a pain in the .... Otherwise, using regularly requires frequent battery replacements.It's a good mouse in all other respects, but I'd much rather have the corded version. ( Are all cordless mice battery hungry? If not, which ones are most battery efficient? )"
4,WHY ARE THERE NO REVIEWS FOR THIS ALBUM?,"Ok...so I'll be the first.This album is trippy, funky, and spacey. Kathy's vocals and Maurice's production and sound design fit like a glove.The one thing I really noticed about this album is that it has ball$. It has some mighty arrangements and musicianship, not often heard much anymore. Excellent cd overall.It just goes to show that most of the good music being made is overlooked these days...."
4,Buy it for Lake Shore Dr,"The usual fare, nothing special, this is from a radio station in Chicago, I believe it is now gone. HOWEVER. Lake Shore Drive by Aliotta, Haynes, Jeremiah is a CLASSIC most people outide of Chicago have not heard it, thats a shame. A nice little ditty that sure to put a smile on your face. The rest.. eh you can find them anywhere but for $6.oo? Lake Shore Dr is worth 10 times that by itself"
4,My little bug lover loved it!!!,"I purchased this product for my 4 year old and he was thrilled when it arrived, we went bug hunting almost right away. My only complaint is that the receptacle detaches very easily so my clumsy 4 year old would release the bug without examining it yet...he'll learn though. Overall we're happy with it."
1,Critical Flaw,"The lid doesn't secure to the unit so it is only suitable for adult use. Children do not have the coordination to keep the unit upright while trying to view the unit from the side. Unfortunately, the lid that contains the bug falls off unless the unit is held perfectly level. This is not good if you are trying to teach a child to confront their bug fears."
4,"Great observation pod, but top magnifier cone does not stay on","This product was purchased in conjunction with the laser vaccum gun for collecting bugs for a boy turning 6. This is a great magnifier as it shows the top and bottom of the bug with a mirror below the bug, but beware that the cone that rests on top does not screw on and you just have to keep it upright on a flat surface to keep it in place so your critter doesn't escape! Keep this toy outside if bugs give you the creeps! Otherwise great toy. Plastic could crack if dropped on cement."
3,peeper,I bought it for my child and gave it away because the lid does not screw on or stay secured in any way. This would be a good product if they fix the top. When the bug is in the toy and your child walks around with it and the top falls off there goes the bug. I called amazon and they let me keep the toy and gave me the money back.
3,Cute- little boys love it,"I bought 2 - 1 for each of my nephews and they did enjoy catching bugs and looking at them closely. My only issue is I wish the top screwed on, because it can come off so easy while a 4 year old is holding it - and whoops- the bugs falls out. Otherwise its a fun a little toy."
4,Durable and enjoyable,"My 7yo daughter loves this. The magnification isn't high quality, but it does allow bigger viewing. The Creature Peeper has stood up to many falls, being left outside in the humidity and heat and just basic wear and tear from rambunctious kids."
1,how to build a straw man,"Lipset et al. assert facts, provide statistical evidence, and use quantitative methods to prove their point without helping us understand why Americans do not join unions. The book is simplistic, and rehashes old arguments. The writers fail to use historical and comparative analysis of the divergent tracks and the U.S. and Canada have in labor relations. The statistical analysis does not substantiate the problemmatic that U.S. workers are more or less militant than Canadians. Not to be taken seriously THE PARADOX OF AMERICAN UNIONISM is nothing more than an ideological screed for intellectuals with lots of time on their hands but little to say of substance."
1,It's pretty but it doesn't work,"iSi usually has good products which is why I bought their ice cream scoop. Although it looks nice and feels good in your hand, it will not scoop hard ice cream."
2,Here's the scoop...........,It's a good idea - having a soft dimple to push out the ice cream ball - but it is ineffective because the dimple is too small. Pretty color. Scoops ice cream. Does not eject.
5,Cross body leather purse,"I have never had a cross body bag before. It took a little getting used to, but I love it now. It holds far more than it looks. Lots of compartments, perfect for carrying miscellaneous card, cell phone, notebooks, cash. I don't know how well it would do with very heavy items."
5,Found only on Amazon,"This is my family's favorite cocoa. Sadly, the stores in our area no longer carry it. Thank goodness for Amazon and thier amazing prices. I was able to buy in bulk and share with friends."
3,Does the job,Good product for the price. Arrived in a timely deliver. Would have like a more sturdy cover. Have yet to use the inside.
2,Arrived damaged. Cover on one book cutup by razor knife,One of the Notary books arrived looking as though it had been cut by a razor knife before it was packaged in the shipping container. This shows poor quality control by the person that packaged the items.
3,Deffinately woth the rent...,"Im taking the middle road here. I am glad that I did not ignore this one. It came up on .99 and I liked all the actors so gave it a try. I went back to read the reviews and was surprised that so many rated this so low. Maybe some were expecting another FB, but when I saw who was in this, and based on the R rating, am surprised that people will rate a movie low based on language, ect. when its clearly to be expected.I found it fun and yes, funny and enjoyed watching it play out. The characters played off each other well, the direction was good. Nothing too unexpected, but kept me watching and interested.If you arent afraid of an R rating, and you know what to expect from that, I would disregard those that rated it poorly on that merit alone.Fun group!"
2,30 mins or less,"Total waste of my time. Not funny, too much cussing. I realy found nothing I like about the movie except when it was finally over. No wonder it bombed in the box office. I work right next to where they were set up filming it, and was excited to watch the movie that was made in the city I work, plus all the drssing rooms, cars, etc was right next door, but what a terrible movie! I would not recomend the movie, period."
3,"Funny, but not really that great...","Overall, It's funny and worth watching...once. Love the cast of the film, all great actors - there just wasn't enough to the story to have a full length movie, but they made one anyway, and it shows."
2,Not worth the rental,"Unfortunately, the best part of this movie is the trailer. It completelt fails to live up to its hype. Save your nickels and don't rent this one."
4,Great movie,"My sons love this movie. I thought it was a bit lame in places but overall, for the price I paid, I'm not complaining."
2,no so funny,"Purchaced this as a sticking stuffer for my son, as he had been wanting to go see it for awhile. Glad we bought it instead of paying $50 to go see it at the theater."
4,Rent it!,"This was one of those impulse buys, it is funny but make sure you watch it before you buy. Rent worthy."
4,entertaining,"I watched this on amazon instant video and liked it. I would never pay $20 or however much it cost to own it (to be fair, I very rarely buy any movies so this is not a harsh criticism), but it was definitely worth paying a couple bucks for as a rental."
3,Yeah.....but NO,"I'll keep it short and simple:The cast is awesome and I love these guys in this flick. It only has a few LOL moments though and the story ain't too bad but EVERY OTHER WORD in this movie is f***!!!! It gets real old real fast.Now.........I have a dirty potty mouth like a logger but man this movie got irritating quick when they couldn't have a normal conversation without that word in it! Don't get me wrong, ""F"" is a great word, I use it on a day to day basis and i love it, but in this movie it's way way over used.Anyhow - it's worth a watch but not to buy."
2,30 minutes of BORING,I love the cast but the movie is just plainly boring. Disappointed from directors of Zombieland. Just save your time and don't watch it.
2,Loud and poorly written.,"A young man working as a pizza delivery guy is forced to rob a bank when a bomb is strapped to his chest. He enlists the help of a friend, and they must attempt to outwit the bad guys. This is another modern-day comedy, loud, vulgar, and a brand of humor aimed at a young audience. This film appears to have either been poorly scripted, or just filmed from an outline of an idea, with the cast filling in with ad-lib lines. Whichever it may be, the movie does not have enough solid comedic moments. If this had combined a theme of dark humor with clever comedy, it would have been unique, but you have a film with some good moments, but just not enough of them."
4,Great Comedy!,"I didn't know how this was going to be, However I took the chance and saw it in theatres and must say it didn't dissapoint. It was funny from start to finish whether event wise or just funny lines. I'm surprised to see this rated with anything under 3 stars to be honest. Give it a chance I'm sure the majority that do will like this movie."
1,Horribly boring no charisma flik for 14 yr olds maybe if they're bored and it's free,Do not waste your time.... I couldn't even finish watching this after 25 min - I really did give it a chance.
1,disgustingly boring/foul,"a waste of bandwidth,time and moneypoor acting, lots of foul language does not a good movie make!!!30 minutes or less??? mostly less"
2,more like 15 minutes or less,30 minutes or less? more like 15 minutes or less. thats about the amount of time you can actually expect to be entertained by this movie.
5,"""Last night, you ate a Lunchables... for dinner! You're a man-child!""","This movie pretty much flew completely under the radar somehow, even though it stars Danny McBride, Aziz, and that guy from ""The Social Network"". I saw it at Redbox, picked it up, and was delightfully surprised. This flick is laugh-out-loud funny, with great support from Nick Swardson. It is ""slacker"" comedy at its finest, with Swardson, McBride, and Aziz each sharing absolutely hilarious dialogue and delivery (the line in my title belongs to Aziz). Be warned, however, this movie is extremely profane, and not suitable for children or the squeamish!"
1,Why did I waste my money?,"Stupid, Ignorant movie. I can't believe I wasted my time or money on this one. The only women were the whore/dancer, the girl who gave it up on the first date and the sister who was a slut anyway...not a decent woman in the movie. The guys had one thing only on their minds. Just stupid, plain stupid. Maybe you have to be a stupid guy to like this?"
5,Hilarious!!!,"Funniest movie I've seen in a long time! It is a little crude at times, similar to a Harold and Kumar movie. It's very witty and suspenseful. I saw this with my husband at the theater and we both loved it!"
1,TERRIBLE!,"I wanted to like this movie, I really tried to. I loved Jesse Eisenberg in Zombieland, and loved the preview for this movie so much that I bought it the day it came out at Walmart for $25.00. I watched about half of it before I took it to a pawn shop and sold it for $4.00. It is soooo bad. The dialogue in this movie is downright disgusting. It's not funny AT ALL. Just a few days ago, I had the unfortunate luck to watch this movie all the way through with some friends. It just kept getting worse. Do not buy this unless you enjoy movies filled with stupidity."
4,Not Bad,"you don't watch this kind of movie to take in a cinematic masterpiece, you go for the energy and the explosions and they deliver. in 30min or less..."
3,Could have been so much better,"We rented this from Amazon Instant video and it was fast & simple. I like the main theme of this movie, but this fell short of being great. This movie was dependent on slapstick humor and bad language and it was pretty slow getting started. We kept waiting for the good part to get started, but it never did. The highlights are in the trailers. Too bad the story-line had real promise."
2,Mimosa Hair Honey,I didn't care for it. It smelled good but that's the only good thing I can say. It neither helped or harmed my hair. I don't think I would buy it again.
3,Oh the smell,This product has a smell that you cna not mask. i don't know what it is but it just sits on my hair. I wll not buy this again.
5,A GREAT Organic,"I am 22 years old african american female,I am currently beginning to change my hair over to natural from chemicl,no more relaxer. But i am also searching for hair care products that are all natural! I have bought two of these products,at once,the hair honey and the healthy hair butter..and let me tell you these have NO petroleum jelly or mineral oil in them!!!!! (just so you know,those ingredients cause clogging of porse on the scalp and make it harder for hair to take in the nutrients)This is definitely worth its price or more,but a great all natural hair product with a very nice scent!!!"
3,"Softening, moisturizing, and light except hard as heck to wash out due to beeswax",This pomade is a very light oil almost as light and fast absorbing as rose hip seed oil. It arrives as pictured and has a strong citrusy scent that reminded me of orange juice and lemon concentrate. I had no idea why it was named honey when it doesn't smell like honey or have it in the ingredient list until I went to wash this out of my hair. The beeswax in this product makes it incredibly hard to wash out and with my hair all stuck together when the water hits it makes it feel as though I have honey in hair. I will not repurchase this product. And I won't even bother using it again.
2,Too waxy,Too waxy. Not enough true hair moisture. I enjoyed her products more when she was in small storefront in Brooklyn. Something has changed.
2,Sticky product,"This smells really good, but.....Not very effective. I do not feel like it moisturizes the hair at all. I little goes a long way and will do the job with an initial application, but wears off and leaves the hair feeling sticky and stiff. Not a fan and will not purchase again."
3,Nice but pricey and moot purpose,"It smells delicious and is a lovely whipped oil consistency. It's very light and gives super high shine. But for the price I can't seem to justify it's purpose. A little goes a long way sort of. Since, it's technically an oil, I can't rationalize using this over some standard olive oil or coconut oil, etc. It was a luxury when I had it as a gift but it goes fast and is just sort of a fancy extra to use more for mental comfort than actual benefit. Sweet product though. I would recommend it as a light gentle natural sealing dressing for babies/toddlers. An adult would go through it too fast."
5,Great Desk Reference,I am currently getting a master's in reading and this is a great book to share with other staff members who do not have the background that I currently do. It is a great desk reference. Makes sense and has good idears for classroom use.
3,inspiring,"It's a good book if you are looking for inspiration. Tovani discusses her experience in trying to promote reading in all classrooms. However, I feel that it is more reminiscient than a tool for instruction, although she does offer suggestions to use in the classroom at the end of her chapters."
4,Fantastic!,This book provides excellent strategies and insights for instructing struggling adolescent readers. Gives real-world examples from the author as well as mutliple techniques to use in the classroom or even to teach your own child better reading strategies.
3,Where's the fourth disc?,"Having been a Genesis fan for a long time, I was greatly excited when the box sets were announced, The Peter Era & The Phil Era. But neither box set has quite lived up to expectations. If your a Genesis fan, this set is a must have, but like it's predecessor, it's not comprehensive enough, and it bounces all over the Phil era. Do we really need the extended ""disco"" versions of songs? On the positive side, I do love the live versions of the older songs that never made it on a disc before, and the songs only found on the EP (Spot the Pigeon). But worst of all, given ALL the music during the 16 year period... WHERE IS THE FOURTH DISK! Maybe they'll have a third archive and give us what we really want!"
3,"haven't purchased yet, but interesting reviews!","I would be interested in finding out where all these hard to find Genesis music is to be obtained if not by these new album releases! I have most all of Genesis on album or cd. But you find me a copy of the American release of ""3 sides live"" and I'll show you a 3 headed chicken!!! I would agree also with a reviewer that if someone wants to please more of the Genesis masses of the 70's and 80', let's see some of the live concerts complete. King Biscuit used to play their Abacab concert and 3 sides live concert----now that was GOOD STUFF! I always wanted to OWN the version of Dance on a volcano-Los Endos off of one of those concerts!!!! (They could have had that on this album also!) I believe I will be purchasing this box set because of the music I am missing fron the 3 sides Live album----less the ""Me and Virgil"" track.(Where did that go to?) I'd like to see some feedback on this!!"
3,Not as good as it should have been,"This is a mixed bag of a review. I do like it, and I'm glad I have it. Good to hear a lot of the B-sides on CD for the first time, along with many of the live cuts. But....It should have been better. The theme of this set, was not INCLUSION (like many box sets), but EXCLUSION. No Me and Virgil (which they once thought enough of to actually play live), while lesser tracks such as Hearts on Fire and 'gasp' the remixes were put on. No Phil renditions of songs that were from the Peter years (the Knife, White Mountain, etc). Perhaps even the drums being mixed down. And the accompanying booklet pales in comparison to Archive 1."
3,Hackett to bits,"First of all ... I am a hard core Genesis fan and have been for the past 28 years, so needless to say, I like them. The first box set was great for me, it brought me back to more than a few concerts that I had seen and experiences I have had. This set is a harder pill to swallow. I understand calling it the ""Collins"" years focused set - but there should be a much larger representation of the Trick of the Tail to Duke years. The biggest sin in my mind is how Steve Hackett disappears in this set (one song???). I realize that Tony Banks and Hackett are not the biggest pals, but there is a wealth of music(live and the like) that would be really nice to hear in this set. There are things that I really like(last seven songs on disc 2 are the highlights of the set in my mind) - but to omit some musicianship over ego is a shame at best. Anyway - the hardcore Genesis fan should pick the set up - if you like the Banks/Rutherford/Collins version of the band, then this is the set for you!"
3,For Genesis mega fans only,"Interesting attempt to complement the first box set, but will only appeal to hardcore fans. Booklet notes and photos alone are a great document. 12 inch singles (dance remixes) should never have existed and don't deserve to be included. Live tracks sound bootleg quality but are acceptable. Casual listeners should go with 1999 Greatest Hits compilation Turn It On Again."
1,Absoletuly Terrible,"This box set only places an emphasis on the Genesis of the 1980's when they changed from an amazing prog rock band to a terrible Collins-dominated pop group. Indeed, this set almost completely ignores the contributions of Steve Hackett. The first box set (Genesis Archive 1967-1975) accurately documents the band's development from 1967-75. The second set is, without a doubt, inferior to the first. This set would have been much better if it contained more material with Steve Hackett."
2,Could have been so much better,"Let's get through the three cd and see what's interesting.Disc one : two cuts only ""Evidence of Autumn"" and ""Inside and Out""Disc two : A good version of ""It's gonna get better"", ""Deep in the Motherlode"" and four jewels here, I am talking about ""Ripples"", ""Your own special way"", ""Entangled"" and ""Duke's Travel-Duke's end"". ""Burning rope"" isn't bad also.Disc three : there's just ""The lady lies"" that is worth listening.Overall, 34 songs on the three cd pack and 10 worth listening to.I have nothing to do with discoteque version of the Invisible Touch album (Invisible Touch, Tonight, tonight, tonight and ""Land of confusion""Why don't we have more stuff with Steve Hackett ?What about the ""Supper's Ready"" 1982 version that the band performs that year ? This cd pack could have been a lot better if more songs when Steve Hackett was in the band were included. It could have been better also with a better choice of songs after Hackett's departure. A very big dissapointement."
3,For diehard fans only,"A worthy compilation of the band's ""pop"" years, but not the comprehensive collection it could have been. Diehards will notice the omission of a couple of rare tracks (""Me And Virgil"", ""Match Of The Day""), and like I did, wince at the inclusion of superfluous 12"" remixes. Certainly the box set should have included the ""Spot The Pigeon"" EP (available only as an import), as well as the extra studio tracks from the US version of ""Three Sides Live"" (now out of print!), in their entirety, in lieu of an ""I Can't Dance"" remix! Not as enlightening as Archive #1 was, but still a valuable set for the collector."
1,"Been there, Done that","Well, the quality is incredible, and the track selection same, but tell ya what... The only track I didn't have prior to this release is the MAMA demo. Everything else is out there in Bootleg form, and the primary target audience for this release is the Bootleg collectors... WHy not get pure and release an entire show? Why just snippets of shows? It's like a bootleggers Best-of-Genesis. I've heard all these tracks enough over a period of years in near perfect Quality, now that the're out in total perfect quality I don't think I'll spend the 30 bucks. And where's Me & Virgil? [a Rare track from the Abacab sessions]To me this release is a disapointment. You want my attention again Genesis? Then release a Soundboard copy of a 1976, 77, 78, 80, or 82 show in its entirety."
3,Large?....Really?,"These are nice warm gloves, but large, they are not. They are really tight at the base of my fingers and limit the range of motion a bit. There is a strange bit of stitching there that can be a bit painful."
1,Boss half finger gloves,"Already sent them back. My son is a surveyor, and on the first day that he wore them, the threads that sew the lining to the actual mitten began to pull out. The color was not even close to what was shown. They were a pinkish beige."
5,Very effective,"I've used another brand of Red Marine Algae and it worked real well, so thot I'd use this brand. It's not something I use everyday, butkeep for when flare ups occur for cold sores. It cuts down the flare up times dramatically."
4,OK,The Box are very well package and very carefullyThat arrives ok and on the time.It s really good.
1,Doesn't work,"I purchased the red marine algae 1 month ago and have taken it every day per instructions, I have not seen any change, still have the herpes virus that is active, no improvement at all"
3,Good first try,"This is the first mystery novel by Naomi Hirahara, featuring Mas Arai, a Japanese American gardener in Southern California. Mas is a kibei, i.e. an American-born Japanese who returned to Japan and spent most of his formative years there. Mas bears the terrible trauma of WW2 in Japan and particularly of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, where his family had relocated. Fifty years later, Mas has little to show for himself. He's a lonely and bitter man, that has survived his wife and is estranged from his only daughter, while his gardening business is wilting. The novel's mystery is connected to his traumatic Hiroshima past, but it is more interesting for the range of characters Hirahara can command (Hiroshima survivors, No-No boys, Sansei civil-rights lawyers), and for the still little-known history of the Japanese American community, than for its suspense. It's a good first try. We'll just have to wait and see what she writes next."
1,Disappointed - why rave reviews?,"I found this novel impossible to get involved in. I give any book a chance by reading 100 pages and this was hard to do. After reading the rave reviews, I forced myself to read to page 150 and was still disappointed. The main character, Mas, was not likeable, and even after 150 pages I did not care about him. The whole cast of characters were unappealing and I got them mixed up.The author attempted to give a Japanese tone to conversations but that just made the dialog more confusing. The plot and interaction between characters was depressing. I don't understand how the novel was praised by so many. I did not like this book."
3,It's ok,"was ok kinda corney story line, but good action. I thought Jackie Chan was acting in it. I'll watch again at a later time might be better second time around."
3,LEGENDARY AMAZONS,"DVD RECORDING A LITTLE PROBLEM HESITATIONS 1/4 INTO MOVIE, THEN ALMOST TO TYHE END. A GOOD MOVIE SHOWING THE HISTORY OF CHINA THAT I WASN'T AWARE OF. GOOD STORY."
5,Good Study,"I thought this movie was really good in the respect of the womens' courage, bravery and discipline especially illustrated in their temple life worthy of the true Amazonian concept."
2,My two stars are generous,"I think the actual value of this movie should be the same as the cost for a cheap frisbee ($3.99) becuase that's really what it is... I'm an avid fan of martial arts and i love the new CGI fly-wire stuff. But really, dont even waste your time and money (just take my copy for free). Buyers remorse. I'll save the typing and totally agree with all previous 3-1 star reviews..."
2,Started out great,This movie started out great but after the first few minutes I could have gone out of the room and missed nothing worth seeing.
5,Finally a Book Totally About Me!,"This book is a guide to looking good, and feeling great, inside and out! There are great tips on getting a good night sleep, giving great pedicures, even how to mediditate. There are great facial recipes that feel wonderful, and good articles on how to eat right~ one of the most luxe books I've read!"
2,Subscribe ONLY if you are very Liberal.,"FAR more left-wing than I remembered from years ago. If you tend to be left-wing, this magazine will by and large reinforce your positions. ""Fair"
1,Disappointing,"I signed up for the print and kindle edition of Newsweek recently. Within two weeks, I received an e-mail saying that the print Newsweek magazine was being terminated and therefore that the free kindle edition would also therefore stop. Although the print edition will cease Jan 1st, I've not received a single print edition since (I only received three)and no refund either. I'm really annoyed and completely unsatisfied in every way."
3,LOTS of ads,"I used to subscribe to Newsweek. Now I know why I stopped. It's chocked full of ADS. Certainly not the quality magazine that I remember. And, it's quite expensive for so many ADS! Blah!"
2,New format: OpinionWeek,"After subscribing for eight years and watching the magazine slide into the morass of pop culture reporting, the final straw was the magazine's recent switch to a new format that eschews real news reporting in favor of opinion essays. In a recent issue, the closing story was not an opinion about recent world events or developing trends, but rather the current state of pizza in New York City.The fact that the magazine's graphic design and layout have been changed to match those employed by their increasingly shady ""advertorial"" clients does not inspire confidence, either. I am discontinuing my subscription and hoping Time has not gone down the same path."
1,"Newsweek ""will no longer...cover the week's events...""","After being a Newsweek subscriber for many years--since I was in high school--I've decided to give up on the magazine. Three months into the new ""design"", I'm finding it mostly an uninteresting chore to read Newsweek, and the copies just stack up unread.To me it's very telling that a magazine called Newsweek said this about their redesign: ""We will no longer reflexively cover the week's events if we don't have something original to add."" (As if ""reflexively"" doing their job is something boring.) That pretty much sums it up--if you're looking for a weekly magazine to make sure that you didn't miss something important going on in the country or world, Newsweek is no longer the magazine for you.And a pet peeve--their new graphic look makes it difficult at times to tell what is magazine content and what is advertisement. Perhaps that was the goal.Goodbye to 25 years of Newsweek. I've made the move over to TIME..."
1,Long term subscriber cancelling,"Subscribed for 10 years; looked forward to catching up on all news the daily local paper didn't have each week. New format is all editorial, biased, little news. I gave it six months after the drastic format change - kept trying to read through each one, tossed it in the trash before I could get through it. Subscription renewal just arrived - I'm cancelling and trying Time - online reviews seem so much better. (Newsweek is not going to make it now....So sad.....Anybody remember Life magazine?)."
1,A fixed thing broken,"We have been reading Newsweek for 30 plus years and have seen writer friends come and go. But now it seems that our trusty Newsweek is also gone. It now contains long wordy essays, albeit indepth, but which don't serve those of us who lack the substantial time needed to read them. So for now it's goodbye Newsweek, it had been great reading you, but now I shall look into Time. Good Luck."
2,Less than expected.,"Not a great layout. A step down from Time for sure. I was expecting a more entertaining read, but at times I felt like I was reading a textbook."
1,Sad,I never got Newsweek on my Kindle as promised.I am getting the print copy only. Would not havebought this item had I known.
2,So rapid a fall,"Such a difference 'tween the WaPo Newsweek and its current state; although, to be fair, the Post itself is barely what it used to be. The lo-o-ow price and the free Kindle access allowed me to rationalize a second chance on this title, but further extensions on my decades-old subscription are not likely."
3,Good price,I am looking forward to getting it for my Kindle and be able to hold it and read. I am not a big fan of Newsweek I think they are somewhat bias.
4,May be my last year with Newsweek,"I don't like all the changes to Newsweek in the last couple of years, but realize that magazines are struggling to stay alive. I rather like the one page articles - better described as editorials - and still find value in this subscription. It is a good value for my money, but it seems every issue has less and less content - even letters to the editor are gone. I don't utilize the website, and maybe I'm missing content I'd like, but I subscribe because magazines are portable, on your schedule, and easy to put down and later return to. I'm just afraid that the era of magazines is dying out quickly. It's too bad."
1,propaganda machine,"Newsweek had a chance to truly change when it revamped about two years ago and FAILED. What should have been a movement towards true independence in journalism was a farce... the same biased reporters not even attempting to hide an obvious slant. Since there are so many choices today, I'll never have to open a newsweek again and look forward to it's failure in the near future."
2,NOT WHAT IT USE TO BE,i have subscribed to Newsweek for years....and a year or two ago they changed their format....now much more advertising...the articles are much longer (not always) and too political...i will soon be cancelling & looking for a more open minded news magazine.
1,This is not the news of the week,"I have long been a subscriber of Newsweek. But this passed year they have made changes which I find unacceptable. Every so often they call an issue a ""double issue"". The pages are about the same as single issue. Nothing in the double issue justifies it to be called a double issue. It only means we receive less issues for our money. Speaking of money. Newsweek has now doubled the price of the subscription of just one year ago when I had renewed for, $19.95.The magazine itself has almost no news or pictures of the ""news of the week"" The magazine is comprised mostly of commentary's and issues of our time. This might work for you if your in the mood for a little deep thinking. But this new, ""Newsweek"" is not for those wanting the News of the Week."
2,hate the redesign,"I really tried to like the new resdesign for the past few months. My subscription ended. I couldn't find Newsweek in many drug stores, grocery stores. Tried a few issues of Time. It's not as good as the ""old"" Newsweek but it's way better than the new Newsweek. Well, I subscribed to Time. Sad to leave Newsweek. I've grown up on Newsweek and it was a good 30 year ride.Bad choice in redesigning what was a great magazine."
2,Letting it lapse after 38 years.,"I first subscribed to Newsweek magazine in 1973, as a high school exchange student in a foreign country. One of my teachers subscribed to Time magazine, I subscribed to Newsweek, and we'd trade copies after we read them each week. I loved Newsweek back then: a fine way to keep up with the news from home and the news around the world.The Newsweek of 2011 is NOT the Newsweek of 1973. It seems like there is much less actual news inside and more ""fluffy"" feature pieces. It just doesn't seem much like the magazine I used to enjoy so much. The publisher keeps sending me renewal notices, but I cannot bring myself to spend $30 to keep the new Newsweek coming. Goodbye, old friend. I miss you."
1,Tina Brown does it again,"After more than 20 years, I am not renewing my subscription to Newsweek. I am reminded of my subscription to the New Yorker in the early 1990s. I allowed that to lapse too, shortly after T. Brown took over. I would dare to say the New Yorker has yet to recover from the damage she wrought there, and now Newsweek is suffering the same."
1,Purchased in May - It's July & still haven't rec'd first copy,This is my first bad experience from Amazon purchases. I purchased the subscription in late May - it's now July and I still haven't received my first copy. Very lacking in customer service excellence!
1,Canceling Newsweek and Time -political TRASH media,"I am finished with the far, far left progressive bizzare viewpoint of Newsweek and Time. I found Newsweek's editor Evan Thomas statement that ""obama is sort of a god"" and obama is greater than Jesus to be grossly IRRESPONSIBLE and highly OFFENSIVE. Are these people on drugs??? They are clearly part of a lunatic group. Newsweek and Time have lost their right to be considered professional media and have fallen to the level of TRASH political HACK publications. Into the trash for both of them!"
3,I'll give it a bit more time,"I have been for the most part disappointed by the new Tina Brown Newsweek. I would read every word every week of Jon Meacham's Newsweek. Now, not so much. A lot of fluff and sensationalism, and the columnists disappoint - Niall Ferguson is no George Will as the token conservative ideologue, and no one is Fareed Zakaria. Still, when they get a worthy topic, like the Bin Laden issue, Newsweek still demonstrates the continuing relevance of the weekly for in-depth analysis. And it's still better than Time without the ponderousness of The Atlantic. I'll stick it out a few more months - maybe Tina will get her act together."
1,Left Wing Propaganda,"I used to be a Newsweek subscriber for years. Although I consider my self pretty middle of the road, Newsweek has turned less into a news weekly, and more into a mouthpiece for the host of liberal columnists and writers that dominate its staff. To be fair, Time magazine is just as bad. Probably the best weekly out there is the Economist, although it is rather dry reading. US News and World Report no longer publishes a hard copy edition so there isn't much choice out there. Avoid Newsweek if you want unbiased reporting. PS: I am not alone in my thinking. Newsweek (the company) was just sold for $1.00 (buyer assuming tens of millions in debt) as circulation is way off. Maybe the key to turning the magazine around is to be more honest and less biased in your reporting and your readers, like me, will return!"
1,Count me among the longtime subscribers who've cancelled,"Newsweek has been a staple since I was a kid -- my parents subscribed and I've subscribed for decades as an adult. I have always rolled my eyes when they trotted out a celebrity cover, but let the occasional pop culture focus slide. But the unrelenting focus on celebrities under the new editor (Madonna's charity troubles; fawning royal wedding coverage) has definitely become a constant irritant. Olsen twins cover was the last straw -- there is no universe in which I consider the Olsen twins' wealth to be news. If I wanted celebrity coverage, I would've subscribed to People."
1,Another disappointed long-time subscriber,"Like a number of earlier reviewers, I, too am a long-time subscriber to Newsweek - well over 20 years. Since I don't subscribe to the daily newspaper, I relied on Newsweek to give me a comprehensive summary and insight into the major news events of the week, with just a couple of editorials. Unfortunately late last year they changed to an all-editorial format - so now I am only getting various opinions about a range of subjects - NOT what I want in a NEWS magazine. This is a far cry from the investigative reporting the magazine used to provide. So for the first time ever, I have purchased a subscription to TIME magazine in the hopes that they will provide the type of news summary that Newsweek used to provide. I will not renew my subscription to Newsweek when it expires, and I fully expect that this once-great magazine will eventually disappear. Such a shame, really."
1,No longer worth reading,"I read with interest the many comments from long-time subscribers about the recent changes in the format of the magazine. I too have subscribed to Newsweek for quite a few years, but with the new editorial format, I find reading the magazine almost agonizing. The final straw was the recent cover: ""What's so great about the IPad --- Everything"". I hadn't realized that Newsweek is now a subsidiary of Apple...Cancel my subscription."
1,News Magazine or teaser?,"We are also long time subscribers having switched over from Time magazine when it was becoming just another ""celebrity"" coverage rag in the 1980's.Newsweek is now so thin, has so little content, etc. and most of the articles refer us for more info to check their website. If I wanted my news on line, I wouldn't subscribe to a hard copy format.We just got our renewal notice, but for the 1st time since the 1980's, we will not be renewing.ShariOregon"
1,Sorry to see a good mag go!,"Yes, I think of Newsweek as gone. There is nothing left of the informative, smart, engaging writing and materials - it's all opinion (mostly stripped of fact) and a desperate attempt to please everybody! One page blue, one page red, one neutral, cancelling out all that was good about the ""old"" format - and the design is boring, uninspired looking, like a brochure advertising a tech company at an industrial fair. You get more ads, less magazine and even less actual content - all of this for more money. What a let down!"
1,Good magazine gone bad,"I had purchased a multi year subscription to Newsweek several years ago. It was a wonderful magazine when I purchased it by in the past year or so it has changed its format completely from supplying information to becoming a large commentary publication. Not what I ordered. Well my subscription will expire next year and will not be renewed.I know they needed a way to save money but they have destroyed a great publication. If you want news and information keep looking, if you like to read someones opinion on issues and not fact this one's for you."
1,They should lower the reading level to compete with the National Enquirer and other tabloids,"I haven't read Newsweek in a few years but I remember when it was an excellent source of news and analysis. If the name and masthead weren't the same, I would not guess that this is the same magazine. It is awful. It's lIke reading a college newspaper the way it leans way to the left and talks about feelings. What tries to be analysis is merely the discussion of emotions. If the reading level went down to 6th grade there might be a market fot this new Newsweek.I bought a $5 6-month trial subscription. I wouldn't subscribe again if it were free."
2,Not what it used to be,"I was an avid Newsweek subscriber for many years. When the magazine switched to it's op-ed approach some years back, I let my subscription run-out.I accidentally ordered a new subscription for the magazine...still not sure how that happened...and I still don't enjoy the magazine.It's a very strongly opinionated magazine and I guess I just prefer reporting done the ""old-fashioned"" way.Occasionally the cover is in such poor taste that I am almost embarrassed to be seen with the magazine.Sorry Newsweek, you lost me... again... and this time I'll be sure not to mistakenly renew my subscription."
2,Long-time reader saying goodbye,"I subscribed to this magazine for over 12 years and what has taken place in the last few months has brought that to an end. The price has doubled and the content diminished. The magazine service I use to subscribe to Newsweek has dropped the magazine as an option. It's like looking at and reading a Sunday newspaper insert. It has no meat like most TV news ""shows"" these days. It's like reading the TV version of news...advertisements with occasional headlines thrown in. What has happened to real news these days? It's a shame."
2,Goodbye after 30+ years,"I got my first Newsweek subscription when living overseas in Africa many decades ago. The international edition really broadened my perspective and I was hooked. I've been a subscriber ever since. What kept me going all these years were the great columnists and the timely (and mostly objective) reporting.I can't stand the ""New"" Newsweek. I don't know what to make of it. I can barely read the print (I've had my eyes checked..that's not the problem), the articles are very biased, and I'm not interested in most of them. I can find the columnists on the Washington Post website (except for Fareed Zakaria..I'll miss him). We've hung in there many months since the change, but it's time for us to move on.If you're thinking of subscribing to the magazine, try it out for a few weeks before subscribing. I'm moving on to the Economist. I'll never have time to read all the articles, but at least they report the news."
1,Biased,"First issue felt like an advertising flyer. The cover was an attack on our president of the sort that would befit a supermarket checkout counter. I signed up for unbiased reporting, depth and information I can't get from the local paper and clearly ad-driven TV shows. I'm not going to get it here. Bummer. Subscription will not continue."
2,newsweek--now with profanity and gossip,"I'm letting my newsweek subscription lapse after about 10 years. The last year or so they've added ""content from the dailybeast.com"", which means that the magazine I used to share with co-workers in the break room has to stay at home. The ""f"" word, which I don't mind at all in my television and personal discussions, is just a turn-off when used in a news magazine. The next best thing I've found is Time Magazine, but even that seems to be slowly dumbing down. I would complain more if I were willing to pay Economist prices for a magazine.......That being said, this might be a good magazine to get high school or college aged boys to start reading the news a bit."
3,"Great magazine, except for Princess Diana cover","I like Newsweek and getting a subscription for next to nothing is a bonus. However, the first issue I received was the one where they speculate what Princess Diana would be up to should she have lived. They went as far as to put an age progressed picture of her on the cover and even made her a fake Facebook page. This was in such poor taste I have to admit that I was shocked. What's next, are they going to make a Twitter page that will show us what the departed Michael Jackson's Tweets are? I would expect this crap from a typical tabloid rag, but Newsweek? Shameful."
2,Needs to find it identity,"I have subscribed to Newsweek for four years now and it seems like they are always changing their format. I really enjoyed it under Meachum, the old editor, b/c the stories were in depth and well-written. Additionally, the OP Eds from the staff writers were excellently defended with lots of facts. Under the new editor, Brown, NEWSWEEK has changed from respectful news weekly to a weekly trying to pose as a internet news site; there is a little bit of everything which all totals up to a whole lot of nothing. Recently there was a section filled with recipes. Recipes??? What does that have to do with news? I'm disappointed and will not be renewing. Newsweek needs to get it's act together and get back to well-written news."
1,New management = pop-culture infotainment,"I used to eagerly await my Newsweek magazine for quality national and international reporting and in-depth analyses, tied together with an engaging layout. My single-minded focus made me read it cover-to-cover the day it arrived.Thank you, Newsweek, for freeing me up to explore new options and giving me that much more time in my week. Under new management, Newsweek has turned into a tabloid-style magazine with hyped up headlines, cluttered layout, and pop-culture news. Time to cancel my free subscription to Newsweek. It doesn't cost me a dime, but it does waste my time in its new format.Speaking of Time, I think I'll give it a try. I expect I'll be glad that I did."
1,too expensive,I cancelled the subscripton before it began because i found another offer at half the price.
2,not what I expected,I was looking for the most beautifully illustrated version of the enchanted tapestry. This was not it - and I didn't know until after receiving the book. I recommend requesting a photo of your used book front so you know which publication you're buying.
5,This was as nice as it looks.,Went together very easy.. I got a set and use in the house. Very comfortable. There is no need for cushions.
3,Generally OK,"I bought two for my porch. These rockers are made in Indonesia and require assembly.Assembly takes about 15 minutes, fairly easy. Instructions are pictures and not words. Seat simply lays in and is not bolted down.Comfort is OK - I'm 6 feet tall and the chairs are just a tad small for me.Rockers look good from the street."
2,it was okay..........,The music was very nice and soooothing....but in my humble opinion...all the music starts sounding the same after the second song..........
5,Sounds to Soothe and Uplift Your Soul,"The magical music on this CD will touch the very core of your soul. Brenne's fingers dance over the strings, creating sounds that could only be created by a master guitarist. The songs are beautiful pieces of work; truly inspiring. I use this CD as an accompaniment to my work commute, background music for dinner parties (both group dinners and private dinners for two ;-), and as part of my meditation.I look forward to more offerings from this artist. Give yourself the gift of this music. You'll be happy you did."
1,not happy,this was not the product i ordered. the picture that you see is not what you get. it doesnt open all the way and doesnt have all the pockets. it has one large opening in the center and a very small pocket on either side of the case. very unhappy.
4,As pictured,"I picked this bag up locally and I think it's just as it's pictured. The difference between the picture and what I bought is that in the picture above, the bag is filled out. As a woman, I realize that this is common. Yes, the pockets on the front are too small to get anything of size into, but I think you could fit a power cord in there. Maybe they've updated the pic since these folks left reviews.This is just a bag... no pockets on the inside and it doesn't open all the way, but for $8, it does the trick for travel."
3,Shuttle for DVD Player,"This is a nice shutttle for our DVD player, but you get what you pay for. I thought when you open it up, there'd be a nice pocket for the cords, ear phones or buds, or whatever. Instead, you just drop your whole player in, and there's 2 pockets on the outsides. The Player doesn't strap in, so it just moves around a bit in the shuttle.All in all, it's fine, I should have investigated a bit better, but I needed something right away, and only had a few bucks. This was a nice price, and does the job, but I might look for something a little more protective in the future."
5,BLACK WALNUT HULLS,This is a very good product for getting rid of intestinal parasites. It comes in capsule form and is easy to swallow.
5,works on dogs,"If your dogs have worms, this is the best product ever. It Kills their internal parasites without poisioning your animal."
1,Made Me Sick,You should read about this product's negative side effects before purchasing. I think it should be taken off the market.
1,"Overlong, lacking in analysis and insight","This ponderous tome provides is a lengthy assemblage of facts about Wriston, but fails to offer very much in the way of insight or analysis."
2,Very disappointing and tiresome.,"Too long, too boring and poorly written. I had hoped that this would be an interesting history and Walter Wriston. Instead, I found it to be a self-serving saga of an insecure man."
1,Was not the book that I expected,"I was surprised when the book arrived, although it was clearly labeled at ""alternate edition,"" I was expecting the regular Calculus and Analytic Geometry but instead received a thin book. This was not what I expected."
5,Stands the Test of Time,"It's a pity more readers haven't read Peter Schneeman's collection of short stories. But it's a complete tragedy that he hasn't followed up with more!As a Penn State English Lit. student some years ago, I had the pleasure of studying under Mr. Schneeman. Not only is he a terrific writer, but he's also an inspiring and excellent lecturer.While this collection and I have both aged a bit, it is still just as fresh as the first time I read it. Very thoughtful, surprising, and absorbing. It stil holds an honored spot on my overstuffed bookshelves.I don't know if Mr. Schneeman is still teaching, but I hope other PSU students have the chance to read a great book by a wonderful writer.P.S. He handed out copies of the book to our entire class -- gratis! The only thing better than a good book, is a FREE good book. :)"
3,Just a footnote to nyctc7.,"The material on this disc is culled from 2 King Biscuit Flower Hour concerts recorded in '74 and '77. They've been released and re-released over & over again, endlessly it seems. The 5.1 mix adds little or nothing to the experience. Like too many concert recordings, the only channels which actually have music are the three across the front, with the rear or ""surround"" channels containing NOTHING but hall ambience, or, to my ears ""audience noise."" Unfortunately, yet ANOTHER live release by ELP which fails miserably to capture their mind-blowing expertise and power. Only those on the Other Side can experience what ELP could do to you in the 70s."
5,Listen To The Truth,You will laugh your ass off. He is the most underated comedian out there. YOU NEED TO BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,HIGH-LARIOUS,This CD is great for some laughs. Be careful about listening to this in the car because bending over the steering wheel laughing is not conducive to safe driving.
5,A nice stuffed animal!,"I bought this lion for my son. Coincidentally, his great-grandmother then bought him a lion animal from another, very very reputable stuffed animal manufacturer. I actually prefer this very affordable Lion I purchased from amazon.com. Its cute and fuzzy and a nice size for child cuddling. A good buy!"
2,dated jargon of a rogue class,"First of all, much of the jargon here is very dated. And since there's very little feeling of respect for any sort of legacies from the past amongst software engineers, I doubt many modern day hackers give any credence to anything that is in here just because it is ""historical"" or ""traditional"".More importantly, software engineers as a breed have been shown to be amoral and power and money hungry. Witness Bill Gates and all the rest. There is very little that is ""cute"" or ""happy"" about such people, in my opinion. In fact, I doubt your modern day hacker even bothers to make up cute little jargon anymore to amuse himself. He doesn't need to, he can take a weekend and go snowboarding in the Alps, or indulge some other sybaritic taste.The only value this book has is as a nostalgia piece for people who initially got into computers 25-30 years ago."
3,"Not my cup of tea, but a must read all the while.","You have to read to gain a toehold on the scene, but it's not the complete story."
4,Review by Security Union,This book has an extensive range of words for general use by hackers and most computer experts. A MUST HAVE if you need to understand more about computer language (the new future).
3,Mostly Anne Rice's Biography,"At first, I was really disappointed because I wasn't in the mood for a biography. I though it was another Vampire Chronicle or something. It is not as bas as I said, just don't expect a killer action thrill. Good for Anne Rice's fan."
2,Not enough,I was hoping for more than there was.It was more of a snipet.There must be more to the birth of a vampire!For what little information there was it's no more than ok.I am glad I purchased a used one.Perhaps there will be a better informed documentary in the future.I love all of the Anne Rice Vampires particularly Lestat.And the Mayfairs are to die for.
3,It's OK,"I own this watch. I have had it for about 5 years. I just got the battery replaced this weekend. It sat in a drawer for about 1 year because I took of the back casing and tried to replace the battery myself and could not close the back on my own. I almost broke the watch trying to get the back closed. I finally took it to a watch place at the mall to have them close the back for me. They did not charge me since I already had a replacement battery. Them not charging me is the best part of my story. If you buy the watch, be prepared to have a professional adjust the wristband (about $10.00)."
4,great watch,"i love how this watch is not like all the other armltron watches, it has a nice blue back and you can set the REAL day, tus, 14th, its a lot more simple them the other watches i have, but i still love it, fits great becuz its soo easy to size, its my 3ed watch by this brand, I LOVE them, and is looking for some more.. i want 7, one for every day of the week ha"
2,If you want to learn Spanish...,"don't buy this book! It had three words in spanish , one being mama!"
5,"Very, very good.","I have been playing cello for almost 7 years and I think that this is the best cello book there is, 10 full books of great songs. I am currently on book 7 and it is very hard, but I still like it. The only bad thing that I have ever found is that the books are somewhat flimsy and fall apart easily by the time you have finished it (it takes me about a year a book)."
4,"Great for beginners, even adult beginners","I'm 24 and just picked up cello this year. This book has been helpfpul in conjunction with a teacher. It has some visual and text explanation in the back for how to hold and play the instrument. It could use more detailed explanations, but if you have a teacher it shouldn't be a problem.It moves at a pace that easy to keep up with and gain new skills in each simple song. I feel like I've progressed surprisingly well. I really didn't think I'd be this far by now.Also, each song is designed to be played on the 'a' and 'd' string for this book, but can be played on the 'g' and 'c' strings as well.You can buy a CD separately that is an aid to this book. It's just the songs in the book played by a master cellist and a piano accompaniment, there's no instruction or ""teacher"" on it."
1,Don't buy..........,"As this movie was one of my favorite British comedies in my Senior year of college, I was very anxious to purchase this DVD and share the many laughs with my family. I was extremely disappointed that the DVD arrived in a clear slip case with not one line of Bio or ""film-facts"". But the real shock came when I started to view this film....very bad grainy transfer, but the real killer was that the sound was so poor with constant static-tracking noise that you could not make out the dialogue for the first 2/3 of the movie. Unfortunately policy is that item can not be returned after it is opened, and there was no way of telling the serious faults until you viewed the DVD. A great, funny example of 60's British comedy.but abosolutely useless in its present form. Save your money."
1,Also wrong notes?,"The biggest mistake is to compare these ""performances"" with the Glenn Gould ones (saw from the web). Also these are too metrical, too sequenced, and sometimes... too ridicolous: see for example the too much staccato of the first and second Preludes, the too much ""in time"" of many recitativos (i.e. Prelude in c minor, Fugue in D major, Prelude in e flat major...), the too rapid trill in the slow tempo of the 16th prelude, the wrong! notes of the A major fugue, etc... Sorry; and Gould was not a machine, as the ""performer"" could think, not a sequence!I would choose this recording for fun, but nothing else."
3,"Great videos, but beware the excessive commercials that it take to reach them","I bought this for ym 2 year old to watch on an in-car DVD player on a recent long drive. He loves Curious George and I do to. The videos and stories are great. However, to get to the main menu of this DVD you have to watch at least five solid minutes of commercials, the DVD is encoded so that you cannot skip them, even if you've seen them before. This means we had to sit through them every time we turn the DVD player back on. I had to sit in the back seat, wait for the commercials with the volume off and only then could I play the episodes. This is the first PBS kids DVD that I bought, the second one had the same issue. I will not buy their DVDs again. I would rather download the episodes and make my own DVDs without enforced commercial viewing."
4,Curious George Goes to a Birthday Party DVD,I purchased this DVD for my 3 yr old granddaughter. Her parent use it in the car when they are travelling.
5,Fantastic Book For The Flea Market and Antique Stores,"Gonzalez is organized, thoughtful, and extremely visual in giving tips on how to recognize Vintage Fiesta from Post86 (reissued) Fiesta, as well as distinguishing knock-offs from the real thing! He discusses each of the impressed stamps and ink stamps used to identify Fiesta, as well as providing pictures of each stamp. He also shows how to measure items to distinguish Vintage from Post86. His value ranges are a bit high, but this book is invaulable when it comes to being a useful resource for new and seasoned collectors alike. This book is great to use hand in hand with the Huxfords' book. The values in the Huxfords are very accurate, but the book can be confusing - especially if you are at a Flea Market and need info quickly. Gonzalez will provide info clearly (and easy to find) without rambling."
2,"Fiesta, LuRay and other color ware","I did not care for the way this book was set up. Not an easy reference book to follow.With Fiesta at the start of the title one would think there was a fair amount on Fiesta, not true.Not that much on Lu Ray either.It was not useful at all.I regret getting the book."
3,"Good book, bad directions","The book that accompanies the game pack is helpful in describing the principles of Feng Shui. Unfortunately the directions to play the game were really imprecise. So go ahead and read the book, but only play the game if you are willing to make up some of the rules yourself. Prepare yourself for hours of frustration..."
1,Smells Toxic,"I'm just warning you guys, this thing smells toxic. It has that super cheap plastic strong odor. I tried airing it out in another room and it stunk up my living room. I then put it outside in the garage and it still stinks. I didn't send it back because I still want an amp cover when the amp leaves the house but be warned that if you sleep in the same house as this cover you will have two-headed babies. It also is not very thick but a cheap thin vinyl. I pretty much knew that would be the case before I bought it however. If I had to do it over again, I would buy my own material and then take it to a tailor. I am sure it won't cost much more than twenty bucks for someone to stitch you a square."
1,Blanket sheds,I bought this item as a christmas gift for my wife because I read Solaron was the best. It shed so much it made the shedding my cat does in the summer seem mild. I got blanket replaced and new one shed as much. Do not buy these blankets unless you want to vacuum your blanket all the time.
4,Not my smartest purchase... no phonetic pronunciation,"I was hoping the pronunciation would be in english phonetics so that I could label everything in the house, the car, and the office... but it is written in Gujarati script. BEAUTIFUL BOOK! It will be great for me in about a year. :)"
4,"Focused on Teaching English, not Gujarati","This is a high quality book with thousands of bilingual labeled items. It has two main drawbacks: it focuses on obscure nouns (cochlea, endocarp, petiole, etc.) and it has a fairly significant bias toward teaching English to Gujarati native speakers. The items featured in the book are mostly from Western culture - actually, it doubles as an introductory science book - in a very interesting way. I would still highly recommend the book. If you need to learn how to pronounce the words, then you are better off learning to do so directly from the Gujarati script, rather than relying on English alphabet phonetics. TryGujarati Alphabet Book (Gujarati Edition)if you need to learn the Gujarati alphabet."
1,Confusing Textbook,"This was the textbook used in my transportation class, and I hated it. Many of the homework problems do not provide enough information, nor does the book provide enough guidance. It is true that engineering involves making assumptions and designing on your own, but this textbook was not very good in teaching you where to even begin."
4,Great Book,The exercises are very well explained and the book follows a logical order in the chapters explained. The exercises and samples in metric values are very helpful for European students and professors.
2,Confusing,"Pros:Thorough exploration of subject matterLots of examplesCons:Confusing layout (sections are indistinguishable from examples)Buries important equations and variable definitions in the textNo color, and few pictures besides confusing diagramsHomework problems often have arbitrary wording and don't give enough information"
5,Awesome,this stereo is super awesome i love it so much the bass on this thing is amazing ive had this stereo for about almost 5 years and its still working for me. The price did surprise me because i bought mine at one hundred dollars but other than that this is worth the money
1,No Service After Sale,"My stereo started having disc problems. Sharp referred me an authorized dealer and it took forever to get it back. They had to replace the ""pick-up"" whatever that is. Then it only lasted about a week and it started having the same problem. I contacted the authorized dealer who has kept the unit forever. I have sent letters to Sharp about the terrible service, but to no avail. I will never buy any product with the brand name ""Sharp"" on it ever again. Buyer beware, no service after the sale."
1,Different version of this product than on the picture!,"The product in the picture is diffrent than what I recieved. My boyfriend has used Suave 2 in 1 for a long time (the one in the picture) and I loved the smell. Recently,Suave changed the product and renamed it ""Ocean Charge"" 2 in 1. I couldnt find the old version anywhere and was pleased that I found it on Amazon and bought 10 bottles trying to stock up. I was very disappointed when I received my package and found 10 bottles of the new version ""Ocean Charge""! I don't like the new version and wish Amazon had updated their image - I would not have made the purchase.So Frustating!"
1,Not the same as the picture,"The product is the new ""Men's Professional"" while the picture showed the old product (the one with the grey cap). The new product does not smell nearly as good and the reason that I bought this product on amazon is because I was expecting the old product. I am peeved because not only was it more expensive to buy on amazon (compared to Fred Meyer where I usually go), I did not even get the correct product. Beware even though they took the picture down it is the dark bottle (Men's professional) without a grey cap."
1,Buyer beware,"I have to agree with all the other reviewers, the new formula for this product just sucks! The scent used to be fresh and smooth; now the new stuff is overpowering and not at all masculine. And the worst part is it lingers! Suave really screwed up when they reformulated this product.And the picture for this item is not accurate; even though the picture shows the bottle for the old formula, the shampoo you receive will be the stinky new stuff. When the old stuff disappeared from the shelf at my local store I tried to order it from amazon to stock up on the old formula. No such luck. Now I have ten bottles of the new formula that I will never use because I hate it that badly. I wish I had known that I would get the new formula before I wasted $30 on this crap!"
1,This new version is terrible!,"This new version is terrible! Smells wrong and for the first time in my life (50+ years) I have oily hair!!! Suave, bring back the old version that so many of us used loyally for years! And, Amazon... this is false advertising! Please fix it!"
2,"""Ocean Charge"" unpleasant compared to older formulation","Cleans my hair well in daily use. But the newer ""Ocean Charge"" formulation is opaque bright blue and has a strong smell. The older formula was clear, colorless, and largely odorless -- very similar to Neutrogena. I won't be buying Suave any more due to the change."
5,Son's Body Wash,This product is great for cleaning that dirty boy of mine. He comes out of the shower smelling good and being clean. This body wash was cheaper to buy online than in the store. What a deal!
3,I forget how bad a writer Fred Rosen is,"I've bought a few of his books over the years. I'm always reminded immediately why I tell myself I don't want another one of his books. He writes like a hack noir novelist and isn't always on-target with his facts. Typos, grammar biffs, sloppy editing. Oh well, you get what you pay for when it comes to mass market paperbacks."
3,"Even in Fiji, some young women want more.","This first feature film from Fiji, or rather the Fijian island of Rotuma, written and directed by a native Fijian,tells of an intelligent young woman who wants more than the traditional ways of her island community.She avoids homemaking skills to aid her father with tasks such as coconut harvesting and is attractedto his folkways and beliefs, instead of the colonially imposed Christianity. This also includes his attachmentto the Rotuman myth of the first ruler, Warrior Woman and her magic. The mostly in the Rotuman languagesoundtrack, with English subtitles, is greatly enhanced by the optional English commentary track. Althoughmost of the actors are amateurs, the results are better than one might expect. A fine insight into a differentculture and its members, struggling to adapt to modern Western society. Recommended."
2,Graphic Torture is Over the Edge,"I have read Pinero bofore. He's a talented writer. Unfortunately, he decided to include in this book a graphic torture scene. I like thrillers but I do not care to read the details of a depraved, sick torture of a defenseless woman."
4,still good,"it came with the camera. but still good. don't ask me about cannon camera is trash. wasted my money. most people say cannon brand is good. i bought cannon camera at the first time digital camera come out. camera camera is heavy, but made is japan. when u recharge the battery. u have to take out from camera. it is shit."
2,Very small for camera,I bought it thinking it will fit my Panasonic digital camera. It is very small. May be it is my mistake that I didnt go through its dimensions.
4,Great Value!,"I picked this up when it was about two dollars or so. It's smaller than I thought, but I guess it's pretty sturdy. This is a good case for someone who is looking for value."
3,It's a fine one.,I took this as a gift from my fuji camera purchase. The case is OK. Just as what I wish.
3,Size not ok even for compact cameras like Sony DSC-W290,Its OK. It has good appearance from outside. I had another similar product from Case Logic and expected it to be just the same. But it is very tight even for my compact Sony camera (DSC-W290). The small pocket is no good either. Aesthetically very good but when it comes to funtionality it is not seem to be doing good job. Overall I would say its okk.
3,Tiny camera case,"It's an o.k. case. I got it for my digital camera, but silly me didn't look at the measurements very carefully and it turned out to be too small. I'm using it as a cell phone case right now (attached to my briefcase) and it works o.k. My only issue is with the velcro closure. It's not quite as sturdy as I would like."
2,Dimensions are incorrect,"I purchased this item because the advertised dimensions would fit my Aiptek A-HD camcorder. When I got the product, it only fit the bottom half of my camcorder. I am returning this item for a refund. This item would fit my Kodak digital camera, it just won't fit the item I purchased it especially for."
5,Free,"I received this free with a gift I bought. The person already had a case but I like this one for myself. It has padding to protect my camera and a side pocket that I will use for my memory card. My other case didn't have a separate pocket, and was thin with no padding for protection. So I got a free gift for myself along with a great deal on a camera for a family member. I am a pleased customer!!Barb"
3,"Cheap, but too puffy","The only thing good about this case is the low price. It is too small yet it is puffy, neither stylish nor so suitable for any kind of camera. However if you are just looking for a case and do not care about the look or convenience it should be a good choice."
3,camera bag,"bag was fine for a small camera, but not what i was looking for. i wanted something for a flip video, this bag was much smaller than it looked. nice bag, but not what i wanted, i sent it back."
3,"Not bad, little small","Bought for a Canon powershot camera and it barely fits in the case, but once it is put in once or twice the case seems to stretch a bit and the camera fits a little better. Don't expect to put much else in there, though, even a memory card would take up too much space. Took to WDW and it seemed to stand up well, did the job well, just wish it had a little more room."
4,Good Value,"I bought this case for my wife along with the Fujifilm FinePix J28 camera and it fits perfectly. It's a great water resistant case that comes with a strap, perfect to carry around. She loved it and we don't have to worry about the camera when our little daughter is playing with the the camera in the case:)It also has a little storage compartment for an extra battery or memory card. Other than that no complaints at all."
4,Nice Solid Case,"Bought this case after my camera had gotten dinged up. Should have bought it long before this happened but when I went to the store and saw them for like $15 I thought it was ridiculous, then came on Amazon and found this case for around $4. It was delivered right away with prime and the case fit my little Canon perfectly. It's not the most attractive looking case but it does the job well. There is a good amount of padding and the closure sticks well. Would recommend this, especially if you can get it for around the same price!"
1,What a disappointment,"I received this DVD as a gift, having several of Jay's previous DVDs and loving them to death. They ditched the old producer, Mits Okabe for whomever this art loving guy is directing this movie. The entire thing is in black and white which is horribly annoying. The dialogue that takes place during workouts between Jay and his partners is unable to be heard because they didn't mic any of the people in the video. The film is filled with annoying music most the time and Jay just seems cold shouldered and hardly talks at all.Couldn't even watch the entire thing, which says alot considering I watched From Jay to Z and One Step Closer several times and they are 4-5 hours long.Shame..."
3,MEH.....,"90% of the video is in black and white. The audio quality sucks. Jay goes through his workouts without hardly saying anything. He waits until after his workouts to explain what he did, why he does it, etc... And when he does explain... he barely says anything."
2,a bit boring and nothing new here,I guess if this is your first BB DVD than this one will do - NO Pain is a sterotype comment in gyms these days but there is a lot more to the sport especially nutrition and diet which most of the time is just a side show in these DVD`s. Watching Jay going through his routines becomes boring after a while and I would have expected more details regarding the ``why and hows`` . I am sorry but if you are not a beginner look elsewhere
4,Latest Edition Of The Popular Toys Guide,"I used and reviewed last year's edition (2000 issue), and find this brand new 2001 issue even better. There are 958 pages (6xx9"") in this volume, with more than 700 black and white photos. There's an 8 page color section. The authors have updated the listings of over 20,000 toys in up to three condition grades. This expanded edition now includes some of the ""newer"" toys such as Weebles, and TV toys such as those based on Howdy Doody, Scooby Doo, Pee Wee Herman, and the Flintstones. Additional new chapters cover space toys and robots. Each section contains background information about the topic. If you can't find the toy in this book, you'll have problems finding it in any book. Very, very comprehensive. Toy collectors will use it often."
5,Unisex Watch,Great watch for the priceNote: All watches have run from out of the box.In the past I have order a $1.000.00 watch and the battery was dead.Thanks For the Good Quality and Service
5,"Read if you are curious about ""near death"" experiences...","Very interesting book...obviously, you may question this one indivoidual's unique experience, but, there are many people who also claim they had ""flat-lined"", went to heaven, walked with God, and were sent back as their purpose on earth was not yet completed...Highly recommend. This woman is a German-Jewish believer in Jesus and her ""walk"" with the Lord during her ""near-death"" experience is profound!An interesting read! The book was hard to put down once I got started!!!"
2,Not good,I do not think this is a good book. The diagrams are not great because the patterns are not very good. The editing on the music is also not very good and sometimes there is to much for such a short work. I would go with a better book like the Rudolph.
5,"matchline, matched mine!","Excellent apparatus, in combination with Philips 9616 PixelPlus TV and Philips MatchlineVR 1200 SVHS, Yamaha TopART Apmplifier and Surround Processors and a fine set of Dali Loudspeakers (2x Blue 606 and 2x Dali Suite 2.5) this DVD player is a joy. SACD: brilliant reproduction, even on regular stereo (hifi) sets or non-multichanneloptions chosen on the amplifier."
2,Very interesting; horribly written,"This guy could not punctuate his way out of a paper bag. It's very detailed, but the writing is atrocious."
5,"Great price, great performance",In reviews of my camera a Minolta Dimage S414 was told it drains the batteries very fast. But with this batteries my camera looks to run almost forever!Another plus is the price. It is a gift! I recommend this batteries to anybody that don't want to change batteries to often.
1,Constantly falls down,"The connection between the rod and the ends is poorly designed. The fit is so loose that if you sneeze on it, the rod falls down. I don't think this is due to the way it was installed because the issue seems to be linked to the fact that there is a little piece at the end of the rod that is supposed to hold everything together by extending into the wall end pieces, but this piece is tiny and prefers instead to snuggle inside the rod. I do not recommend this product."
4,One man's struggle,Tales of Two Cities is a great book. It gives readers a first hand experience of the good and bad of both regimes (monarchy/democracy). This book demonstrated the horror many Iranian have gone through both before and after the revolution. This book also let's you experience first hand the Persian/Iranian culture. Read this book and learn about one man's struggle!
1,Fast shipping; atrocious packaging (leaked inside),"This was shipped and delivered quite quickly. However, the packaging was totally inadequate. A four-pound plastic bag of a toxic, powdery substance was stuffed into a USPS flat-rate mailing envelope barely big enough for it. There was no padding or any protection other than the product bag itself. In fact, the bag was leaking when I opened the package.I managed to salvage most of the powder and clean up will not be ordering any more items from this vendor.I realize the vendor probably chose this packaging to minimize the shipping cost. But it was not worth it."
3,My opinion on the MVCCD400 CD Sony Digital Camera,"This WAS a great item. I like the idea of the photo going directly on a CD, but now the camera is way outdated. 4MP with 3X Optical Zoom is just not powerful enough to use practically! I'm looking for a more powerful ""direct to CD"" digital camera now. Any suggestions?????"
5,"Finally, a good way to save my pictures.",One of my greatest problems with digital cameras was that I wasn't good about saving copies on removable media. This camera starts by burning my picture to a mini-cd and I love it. It is as feature rich and quick as my other Sony camera. It's buffer is large enough that I've never felt a slow down in my picture speed. Just a great camera.
4,More Sarah Bird,"While I can't say this was a wonderful book, it certainly was a lot of fun. I truly enjoy reading Sarah Bird... her characters are so real, yet so unique.My favorite book of hers, the Boyfriend School was so great, I looked everywhere to find more by her. And it was only when I found her on Amazon that my thirst was sort of quenched.If you like reading fun stories, that stand apart from the usual stuff, her books are it."
3,Not enough umph,"While there are a couple of standout tracks on here, the tribal and vocal mix becomes very routine, never reaching any outstanding peaks, and just sort of thumps along after a while. It's not a bad collection if you want to get your hands on a couple of rare mixes. Standout tracks for me include: Wishing You Were here, the rare Tracy Young remix of Gloria Estefan, the incredible Tracy Young mix of Cyndi Lauper, and the final track, Believe in We. Track times are mostly rather short also, but there are some pretty long versions:1. wishing you were here (6:59)2. That feeling (4:47)3. Rapido (5:32)4. wrapped (7:03)5. Hum melody (3:43)6. feels so hot (6:02)7. Ferosh (6:55)8. get back to the music (4:13)9. drums (6:33)10. Shine (9:15)11. sexercise (5:34)12. Jadore (4:09)13. Believe in we (9:02)"
3,It's ok for pre-party or after-party,This CD's music is too casual for the hardcore circuit. None of this music you would find during peak hour. It's great just to get things started or cooling down during an after party.
2,Weird screws,"To install you must loosen two star screws, so had to buy the toolset to do so, once installed it does seem to work well, although you can not reverse it to shut it off."
2,Potentially dangerous,"I haven't had any problems after several years with this timer however a problem with my exhaust fan it's controlling has caused concern. You cannot manually turn this switch off. My fan was buzzing and not turning this morning when I set the timer to 10min. Afraid it was about to burn up, I tried to shut it off with the timer but could not. Fortunately the fan slowly started turning and did not burn up but I will be replacing the timer asap."
5,Product worked great for me for the past 4 months,I have had the Intermatic 60-minute spring timer installed on 3 different bathroom fans for the past 6 years. One finally failed and would not count down when you set it above 30 minutes so I replaced it with this unit which is the same model number as the original installation. I have had it installed for about 4 months now and it works fine. I will probably buy another one to have as a spare.
5,Tom Feltenstein reveals the secrets of the art of living,"Tom Feltenstein is a remarkable man with an unusual ability to stand outside the ordinary paradigm and offer his readers a new way of seeing. In Uncommon Wisdom, Tom presents an uncommonly rich mix of mind-opening quotations and penetrating insights. Drawing from the teachings of many traditions, he reveals the secrets of the art of living.DINABANDHU, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OMEGA INSTITUTE FOR HOLISTIC STUDIES"
5,Incredible Book filled with great knowledge,"I got this book for myself, but found myself sharing this with my teenage daughter and thought that the messages were truly inspiring for both of us.One section that I especially liked and shared with my teenager repeatedly was about self love. I have not read many books on this subject but found it was written very well and that you have to love yourself in order to love and help others that you will be helping in the future."
1,Common Lies,"This book is supposed to be about integrity, values and honesty. I say ""supposed to be"" because after reading the book you'll find that there is very little authentic writing from the author. Most of it is stories and information gathered from other sources. Anyone can pay a ghost-writer and then take credit for the work, but how authentic is that? If you're looking for a bunch of random quotes from people other than the author - this book is for you. If you're looking for advice from someone who is honest and truly leads a life with integrity - you'll be highly disappointed. I was!"
4,"Remembering my"" sixties""",Listening to Barbara is a special feeling of memory.It remembers me to my youth in Cologne.
1,A Disappointment,"I bought this book for a friend who loves Paris and has a dog named Max! Unfortunately, I must send it back! There is no way I would give this book to anyone. I find the illustrations repellant and the story irritating. It is interesting to me that your other reviewers felt so differently! To each his own."
2,Unexpected disappointment,"After a series of informative, stimulating, and gratifying works on everything from openings to endgames, tactics to strategy, Seirawan blunders with this move. The text details a number of interesting games and examines the rationale and philosophy of play with each but the book provides a disappointing treatise on the topic of combinations, the ordained reason for the book's existence. The title and preface would lead the reader to expect an in-depth review of combinational ideas, examples of unique and inventive combinations, and the challenging puzzles and tests that have consistently garnished the author's prior works. This one, sadly, seems to be a hodgepodge of material thrown together as an afterthought in the endgame of what has otherwise been a brilliant match."
2,Not So Good CookBook Holder,"This product comes in a box that does not include any packaging material, no instructions, just two acrylic pieces that are supposed to be a cookbook holder. I know I may not be the brightest bulb but I am college educated so you'd think this would be easy to figure out. You would think that the manufacturer would want the public to be able to assemble their product with ease. In this case it is very cryptic & a conundrum that remains to be solved. Amazon did connect me with Secret Pantry but all they did was send me a useless photo as the item is acrylic & does not photograph properly. Ah, the joys of internet shopping!"
4,Tell me The East Story,The book wasn't exactly what I had expected but it was a great book for little ones. I mistakenly thought I was getting a book for older kids....but what I got was great!!!!
4,Superman's 2nd Battle Against Doomsday,"This book is about Superman's quest to locate Doomsday after having recurrent nightmares. This book is not as good as the ""Death of Superman"" or the ""Reign of the Supermen"" but can help patch up the story of Doomsday.Now this story occurs after Superman has already come back from the dead. Doomsday's origins are explained as well. Can Superman actually beat Doomsday, despite the fact that Doomsday evolves past what previously killed him? You can find out in this book."
2,Really quite terrible,"If you ever want to read some really lousy story-telling I recommend this series. The writing's not awful, just... not very good. An excellent example of What Not To Do for aspiring comic book authors. The art's decent, I guess, but many panels remind me of the backs of cereal boxes, or those old Fox Kids magazines. If you want a story with minimal plot and a lot of action then this series is for you. If amateurish characterization (and really lousy dialogue) makes you gag... pass."
2,Krypton Safety Net,"When is someone going to write Superman so that it does not sound like the same writers that were writing for him in the 1930's? This book is full of the same cornball dialogue that has become a plague throughout Superman's career. Superman grew up human - why not make him sound like it? This book does allow us to see a more human side to Superman - one with fears and an eroding self-confidence. The problem is that this unique storyline is overshadowed by the grade school, dumb it down writing. The story also uses the old fail safe, when it doubt make it Kryptonian safety net. The greatest challenge in a story about Superman is finding something that can challenge him, Krypton is too easy and this reader is anxiously anticipating something else. Superman is the greatest superhero of all time, but his future is endanger with these tired run of the mill storylines."
5,Adorable and super soft!,"I recieved this plush as a gift and am not disappointed! It is very life like and super soft!! Its a great size to cuddle with or put up on a shelf for display. Excellent quality of plush, does not have that cheap feel as a lot of toys do nowadays. Steve Irwin's autograph is a nice touch. Definately recommed for Steve fans or croc fans in general!"
2,Good if you have a protected spot for these lights,"Good price, maybe they'll work for you. I had no trouble installing these. You just pop the stem of the light onto the cable and the teeth pierce the insulation, making a connection. There is a low voltage transformer that controls the on-off timing. I put it inside the cellar and ran the wire through a small hole drilled in the window frame, and ported it to the outside. Bury the wire in the soil, cover with mulch. Took maybe an hour.BUT these aren't industrial strength lights and the neighbor's dog immediately knocked them off their stems and broke them the same day I installed them. In short, put them in a protected place or leave them alone. They aren't very strong."
3,It's just ok,"This product did help to control proud flesh, but as far as starting the healing process, it fell short. I had purchased more than one container of Proud Flesh Powder and was beginning to think that the wound would never heal until I found a product that started to clear up the area almost at once. It's called Proudsoff, a paste, and is available on-line."
5,If you have breast cancer - you need this book,"I was just diagnosed with breast cancer, had a lumpectomy, and am currently receiving chemotherapy. This book did not FRIGHTEN me like all the other well-known breast cancer books. It had humor and practical advice, it had the medical information I needed, it even had information on how to ""fight"" with insurance companies. I highly recommend this book. It helped me so much!"
5,Factual and funny on such a serious subject!,"This book focuses on the seriousness of breast cancer but does add some humor to help decrease anxiety in women facing this horrible disease. The book also offers search and find puzzles, jokes, and words to some of Rosie's songs you may have heard on her show. Numerous questions are answered in easy to understand format. There are a couple of illustrations scetched in black and white. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about breast cancer, prevention, and treatment. There are breast cancer organizations, along with other helpful resource information, found in the back of the book, many with telephone numbers and email addresses. I find this book to be a very good resource for anyone wanting to learn more."
3,No overture!!,"I think it is important to let potential purchasers know that Gavazzeni, ever the know-it-all, has seen fit to improve Donizetti's opera by chucking the magnificent overture. After all, he knows so much better than did Donizetti what Donizetti wanted. Again."
2,IT LOSES PICTURES!!!,"Not sure if anyone else in this reviewer pile has seen this, but I have had several ""life events"" including birthdays, my son's sonogram, and others that the camera shows upon review through its display the pictures you have taken. However, upon connecting it to the USB interface, they disappear. Disconnecting from the USB cable does not get the pictures back. Can you believe that Sony would release a product like this?I bought this device for the ease of use, USB capability, and the CDR/CDRW format. However, for anyone wanting a reliable camera buy a $12 disposable! You can only rely on this unit giving you permanent digital pictures 91.2% of the time.If I had to do it again, I wouldn't buy this unit. There are far smaller units at a fraction of the price with 100% reliability. Granted, some of them don't use CDR/CDRW technology but memory sticks are fine with me it they don't lose pictures (and the cameras are quite smaller)."
3,"Great Camera, No Vista Drivers","I've owned this camera since 2002, and it's still great. Unfortunately, Sony really hosed me when they didn't provide a Vista driver for it. Obviously, you can now get a lot more camera for a lot less money than I paid for this one, but for the limited use mine gets, it is a shame that I'll have to throw it out before it wears out. I probably won't buy a Sony to replace it for that very reason."
5,IT IS GREAT!!,TO ALL THOSE AS.....S WHO TALK S...!! IF YOU DONT LIKE IT DONT BUY IT AND NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR OPINION ANYWAY!!!!RP
2,"In the MODERN music industry, not up to standards","Listening to the CD brought me memories of the 1980's, but Back for Good, I don't think so. When they did their remixes and resings, it sounded the same as it did back in the 1980's. If the singers chose to be Modern; they should have did a high energy, techno, or house style remixing; and make their vocals faster. After this release, now I understand why original artists do not resing or rerelease their songs in the 1990's. Mr. Bohlen, next make sure you modernize your music. This is a waste of money, I bought it expecting to hear cool remixes, but got disappointed hearing 1980ish music. If you want Modern Talking music, just buy the older releases."
3,Very disappointed fan of Modern Talking,"I was excited when I first heard that Modern Talking is getting back together and the fact that they will be making a new album made me ...very happy. First thing I did I ordered their new CD, and by far that is the lamest job they ever did. Their new remixes are barely changed, and new songs are nothing but a ripoff Backstreet Boys with a song such as ""Don't play with my heart"" vs Backstreet Boys, ""Quit playing games with my heart"", or Europe's song ""Final countdown""...it is just pathetic it is what it is. It definately not worth 20$ and I used to be a hardcore fan."
5,Modern Talking is fantastic!,"My favorite group! My brothers and sister and in-laws and relatives and I have been listening to Modern Talking since the 80's. Sometimes, I still get into the mood and play their CDs everyday for several weeks while driving. I am currently back in that mood again. I have 2 of their gold collections (around 38 songs) including the fantastic ""You're My Heart You're My Soul"" and ""Brother Louie"" etc. However, I cannot find their ""You're My Love You're My Life"" and ""Baby Baby Blue"" songs anywhere. Please include the title of their songs on the CDs so I won't be ordering the same CDs again."
4,"Fairly Good Dance RemixCd,,,Must have 4 any MT Fans.......","This album rockes,,,all the remixes are great,,and eric singleton contributing with the rap in ""You're my heart"" all the sounds are fresh.i really appreaciate it because i'm like the only one around to have their newest CD...All you Nsync and BS fans chek this out!!!"
3,Not bad. Recommended for all MT fans.,"This album has 4 new songs, but the rest are plain old stuff with faster beats except ""lady lai"", ""give me peace on earth"" and ""angie's heart"" were actually remixed for new version. Personally, I enjoy this album. Recommeded for any fan of Modern Talking."
1,God I HATE 'You're My Heart You're my Soul'!!,"I've listened to this record once, and that was enough for me. Take it for my word, this is meaningless ""updated"" 80's disco. If Modern Talking think this actually WILL make them modern, you better think twice! It's not just that I dislike this type of music, this is just NOT good dance-music! I think this is hypocrisy, to just show up here once again at the end of the 90's and try to be ""cool"" with reworks of the group's previous 80's hits. They're failing! The music is neither modern, nor exciting. It still breathes 80's, still lacks of intelligency. I agree with the reviewer before me. This doesn't rock. The only move it generates from my side is to make my right-handed middle finger arise, whilst the 4 others are kept down."
2,"Poor quality control, nice features","I've purchased two. When I left the first one in a hotel room two years after purchasing, I went out and purchased a second identical one to replace it. Unfortunately, where the first was solid and dependable, the second fell flat on its face."
4,Engaging telling of a classic tale,"A fine, compact telling of this classic tale of chivalric romance by the quintessential Beaumonoir. Mr Lee's splendid characterizations bring the tale to life in a compelling and lively fashion (despite what Audio File may think) with a gravity that serves the material well."
5,a Mormon surrealist extravaganza,"This book is one strange long hoot. Dogs who become lizard-dinosaurs, and women who become the same. This is the strangest little novel -- very funny in places with lots of hidden recesses, and odd hints. The author is extremely allusive and elusive with lots of strange ideas connected to an underground cave full of menacing dinosaurs who can mutate into anything they want. ...-- if you like Captain Beefheart you'll like this."
3,Not what I expected.,"This book had the wrong picture and description on the website, the description said Version 12 and it ended up being Version 11, gave me problems in my class because apparently, the version 12 has a lot more pictures than 12, oh well, my loss."
4,College Textbook Bargain!,"It was great getting a used textbook for a college class that required this book. The price for a new textbook was astronomical! When the professor said he wanted us to get the book for the pictures, and it did not have to be new, it was a real money saver! Thank you Amazon! The book arrived with the packaging in bad condition, but the book itself was fine."
1,this is a HORRIBLE DEAL,"I cannot believe I paid [money] for an item that is falsely advertised. This pouch looks to be pretty large, even the picture of the little girl you use makes it look bigger...all in all this item was the size of my two fists put together, what a waste of time AND money! Now I have to go out and buy something for Easter regardless as I am returning this waste of time to you. Even the tool that are included are so small I am not sure WHO would enjoy this product. All in ALL I am VERY dissapointed in this product...I will not recommmend this to ANYONE EVER."
4,It's cute!,This is a great little present for the spring time....but it says 3 and up - it should be under 3! It's quite babyish!
4,Fun Pretend Set,This is a nice garden set that my 3 year old carries around with ease. The pieces are easy to handle for his little hands when he is helping daddy around the yard. The set is more for pretend than for actual digging. The pieces fit nicely in the tote that is similar to my garden set.
2,LOWER THE PRICE ON THIS ARTICLE,Your price is not a reasonable price for this article.I think that you should lower the price on this article.
5,An inspiring look at communism and the loss of childhood.,"When I first read this book, I was 10 or 11. My mother recommended it to me, depicting the portion of the story where the daughter goes looking for her white kitten, named ""Democracy"", and is in the streets of her newly-communist town calling the pet by name. This book is for young people who enjoy intrigue and secret clubs, and for older persons who can remember how they felt that certain summer when the world changed and they discovered youth was gone. Set in Greece at the beginning of the Third Reich, the story involves 2 sisters, one who wants to be popular and the other who wants things to stay just as they are, and their older cousin's involvment in overthrowing communism. A wonderful story that is hard to put down, Wildcat Under Glass will teach you how the world used to be or help you remember what the world overcame"
3,okay...but- da daa dunnn,"The first three books were intense, amazing and clever. Now, this forth one seemed to have been cranked out in a few months. The writing stayed the same, but some of the scenes could have had more substance behind them, maybe even more drama. In the end I really felt that there was no need for some of the characters to have even been here.But hay, I'm of the opinion that he should still be a kick-ass wizard vamp. Either way, this was still a better read then a few other books that have been released. If your just looking for something to pass the time, or entertain a fantasy world then definitely grab it."
5,Wash your fleas away!,"Brought a new kitten home this summer and she was infested with fleas. She kindly gave them to our daschshund, also. Both animals were miserable. We gave them a bath using some other OTC product, but it did not seem to do any good. Frontline was also not affective.We gave them both a bath using this shampoo and the fleas that didn't commit suicide jumping into the bath water, died immediately on contact with this shampoo. Plus, this product has a nice scent and leaves the animals' fur soft.I like the fact that it not only kills on contact, but keeps fleas from maturing for almost a month later. If you have a problem with fleas, I would highly recommend this product along with the premise spray for the home.I have not found anything that works as well as Vet-Kem products. They do what they say they will do!"
3,A Pictorial History,"Ok, this book would have been alot better had it been coffee table sized. As it is, the photos are nice and the book is laid out with a few pages devoted to each year in NASCAR. Overall, a good begining book for those interested in NASCAR.I Bought it for my dad (as he loves NASCAR). Had I thought about it and seen it was a small book, I may have gone for a different book. The book is THICK, but would have been better larger. Lots of color and B&W; photos. Good layout with info on the big events of each year."
5,Good History of Proposition 13!,This was a very entertaining book. The star of this writing is Howard Jarvis.His role in bringing about the passage of Proposition 13 is written in detail in this book. You are given the story of skyrocketing taxes in California that brought aboutthis revolt.You are also informed of the shockwaves that thepassage of this proposition had on the California politicalestablishment.The views of Howard Jarvis are also shared with the reader.Especially amusing was Mr. Jarvis' meeting with California Governor Jerry Brown.This proved to be a very informative book that you will enjoy reading.
1,Recipe for stomach pain!,I read this book and was thoroughly convinced that the author was onto something big. I purchased his special product that alters the PH of water to help alkalize your system. I began to experience strange stomach pains. It took me many months to ferret out that it was his product that was causing it! I tried another bottle: same problem. It didn't matter when I took it or whether I took it with or without food and/or other supplements.
5,A GREAT READ,AS SOMEONE WHOS BEEN STUDYING HEALTH AND NUTRITION FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS READ HUNDREDS OF BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT I CONSIDER DR. WANGS BOOK ONE OF THE TOP 5 IVE READ. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE LOOKING TO INCREASE THEIR LEVEL OF HEALTH.
5,great book,This book is excellent. I like the way he spells out what happens to food that is not turned to fuel. This book should be in everyone's library.
1,Information without enough hard science,"Extraordinary theories require extraordinary proof. This book hit on some good concepts and modalities (alkaline for health, especially in this modern acidic age), far-infrared saunas, etc. But very weak on the proof, and details.And the ""alkanized water"" concept. A scam! I can drink a glass of distilled pure water, and a little leaf of kale will have more essential minerals and nutraceuticals than ""alkanized water"". One can alkanize water by adding lye if you're really hardcore. :)I bought the book for some deeper details into far-infrared, but it was pretty weak."
4,In-depth Information Piece,"This book is like a backbone book on how the human body works and ages as regards alkalinity and acidity. It is written kind of like a fact-book in many places, sometimes going more deeply into the chemical nature of things than ""John Q Public"" wants to know, but its comforting to see its been investigated on this level. And the author always comes back to explaining in plain terms. I recommend it as a basic book for those interested in alkaline water. But don't buy this expecting to find a ""miracle pill"" type cure for aging."
3,clears up the confusion on what type of water to consume.,this guy knows so much yet he really is afraid to take a stand...let's just let the alkaline water fix everything. I really liked the info in this book but i think the author coped out on taking a strong position. plus i see his name associated with too many products and technology he recommends. but don't let that stop you from getting an ionizer. I do believe him. he compliments most of what i've read about the acid/alkaline relationship in our bodies.
4,Happiness is reading Reverse Aging,"Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, I found it easy to read and the text made perfect sense. I could not wait to start using Dr Whang's products and I have passed this book onto a couple of my friends."
1,Negative from beginning to end!,"I purchased this book to give to my boyfriend. I read it first (easy read, finished in a few hours) and immediately regretted buying it. Grant Cameron is negative from start to finish. I believe that he scares the readers more than he encourages them. He does not fully explain many aspects of the healing process, or about the abusers thoughts and feelings. Overall, a terribly negative book that I would not recommend for someone who needs to remain positive throughout the healing process."
2,DIdn't apply to us,"This book simply didn't apply to me and my wife. The experience the author relates is different to my own and I couldn't draw many parallels, and therefore didn't get much out of it."
5,Excellent book for partners who are in a relationship w/one who has been sexually abused.,"I am a licensed Counselor, who specializes in trauma/substance abuse.In reviewing this book, I have found it to be a wonderful book for my client's partners to better understand their significant other's needs and their own. This book creats hope for both partners, and supports increased and healthy communication between both individuals. I would recommend this book for anyone who practices within this field, or an individual who is involved in a loving relationship with a person who has been sexually abused. Remember:""It is better to be active and supportive with those that have been abused, then to do nothing at all, and hope one day things will work itself out."""
3,Good book about this topic.,"This is a pretty good book, well written and easy to understand. Basically it's support guide for men who are in a relationship with a partner who is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse.The book isn't very long. There aren't many books written from this angle so its worth getting and reading, you could always donate it to a public library later on to benefit others."
3,Quick read. Nothing too suprising.,"Nan Graham is a radio commentator for a Public Radio station in Wilmington, NC. This book is a collection of her commentaries on Southern life. Quick read, nothing too surprising."
5,A perfect delight.,"This book is a wonderful compilation of small essay's written by a commentator concerning life and living in the South. It's small, each essay takes only a minute or two to read, and its a joy to read. Take a little bit of Southern Comfort from this book as it will warm your heart and lighten your heart. Highly recommended."
4,Einstein was a romantic naturalist,"This books digs to the core of Einstein's views on God and Religion. While Einstein (like most intelligent people) did not believe in a personal God, he did have an almost religious mysticism. What he would call 'God' would be more in accord with Spinoza's God or the natural force. In regards to a personal God, Einstein made his position clear:""It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."" [Albert Einstein, 1954, from ""Albert Einstein: The Human Side"", edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, Princeton University Press] """
2,Eintein and Religion: Physics and Theology,"Do not be deceived by the welcoming jacket on this book. This is primarily an academic text.The subtitle is ""physics and theology"" and not the other way around. This may be deliberate, because although the book actually starts with an emphasis on theology it evolves (or devolves, depending on your perspective) into a treatise on advanced physics.Despite Jammer's sometimes ackward English and despite the fact that portions read like a master's thesis in philosophy - the book is most accessible on the theological side. The reader gets insight into the spiritual side of Einstein. Jammer shows conclusively that Einstein did believe in God and does a reasonably good job presenting the philisophical underpinnings of Einstein's beliefs.Unless you have studied advanced quantum physics the second part of this book is very tough going."
4,Black Cohosh,So far it works purfect it releaved my leg aches and pains. within three months of starting it.I had a feeling I was short on hormones. It's a herb and in a low dose amount it is not too potent.
4,Nothing Like the Sun New,"I am a busy person, like most of us....but I thought I knew what Sting was up to most of the time.....did he re-release Nothing Like The Sun...I have a copy issued in 1987...what's up ? Someone please respond to me...I haven't been able to get any information about this CD..guess I'm just not up to speed....Thanks!"
4,Great reference book,This small book will help in classification of plants that are entered in the North Georgia State fair.
1,The horror ...the horror....,"No, it's not the living dead that are the true horror of this book. It's the terrible writing, the lack of editing, and the incredibly bad use of simile. I can only be grateful that I wasted six dollars on the downloaded version and not twice that on the paperback. There are many free fan written stories that are better edited and written."
1,Halfway through and forcing myself for the rest...,"Every other review I've read about this book is dead on. This is the absolute worst anomoly of grammar I have ever encountered. If a lower rating than one star existed this book would have it. As an absolute lover of all things zombie, and since I did pay for it, I will finish this book. The story could be decent if it were somewhere else, another book or perhaps in a film. The only saving grace for this book is my vivid imagination, making picturing the scenes while ignoring what I'm actually reading possible. Unless you have a lot of time to waste, don't read this."
1,Umm...yeah.,"I love a good zombie book and I give mad props to the author for putting his pen to paper and adding to the body of zombie lit, but someone should have proof read this.The story isn't bad if you can get past the awkward writing.I gave up about half way through. It was like having my liver eaten by zombies."
3,"New Style, not suitable for all","First off this book would make a great movie. It is written more like a script than anyother novel I have ever read.There are alot of problems with it, the biggest is getting passed all of the spelling errors and random commas. Once you get passed that, theres really nothing to complain about.I think Greg Smith set out to tell a story of destruction not only from the point of view of a farmhouse, or say the vantage point of a mall, but of the whole city ranging from annoying artys types to a pair of cops, to even a grocercy stock boy. You could attack the book for not building a strong character plot, but this is just an in your face zombie violent book.Theres not much to this book on the character development lines, but if you want to read a visually descriptive story about zombies taking over on a very large scale, then this will entertain you."
2,Must be written by a child,"The Zombie parts were cool but the writing is so bad it's sad. You would think that as a writer you would want to proof read your work, or maybe do a spell check, Gregory Smith did neither. If you decide to read this book give yourself a few extra hours just to decipher what the author is trying to say.My recommendation to you Mr. Smith is to go back to writing comics because novels are way out of your league."
1,Horrible writing makes for a bad read!,"I can't believe I allowed myself to suffer through this horrible writing. The premise was believable enough but between misspelling, typos, bad grammer, and atrocious writing this had to have been one of the worst books I've ever read. I just can't describe how horrid this was. Thios book should be used at workshop to illustrate improper editing and how not to write."
1,"Poor, even for zombie fiction","Simply put, ladies and gentlemen, this book is poorly written. I'm the kind of guy that hates to complain, especially when one's feelings may be hurt. Complaining about this book, however, seems more like a civic duty for me. The idea alone might have been clever had there never been a zombie story to precede it. The writing itself is the book's biggest problem. The grammar, punctuation, style---everything---will make you stop so many times in confusion it'll irritate the hell out of you. I felt like I was reading the result of a middle-school english-class' essay competition where the winner had to write the poorest piece of sci-fi that they could. I found myself wondering if the author used, in lieu of an actual person of course, microsoft word with a virus attached to it as an editor. My advice, skip this book, use the time to practice oragami, sleep or get that root canal out of the way."
1,Poor Role Models,"It is a shame the author chose to glorify several instances of violence and rude behavior in this book. He writes fawningly about how Kareem Abdul-Jabar, ""slugged a player - and knocked the man unconscious."" The book describes how Larry Bird smashed chairs against the wall and ""screamed insults"" at halftime in order to get his teammates ""fired up"". It also admiringly describes how he, ""...trash-talked, even to older stars"".If you want a book that teaches your child to admire these sorts of behaviors (and others described in the same manner), this is the book for you. I think most parents, however, will find this book as inappropriate and shocking as I did. It's too bad the author couldn't have stuck to writing about basketball. Random House should be ashamed of themselves to market this as an educational book (STEP into Reading)."
4,basketball's greatest,well this was a really informative books for the kids if they are interested in basketball...it also has the kids favorite players which include superstar Michael Jordan...this book was more of a kids fun then an educational book...but very informative for kids
2,Good Price...so-so movie.,"For five bucks, I shouldn't complain. However if you are expecting it to be like the STARS channel...forget it. Guess that's why it is marked down from $19.95."
2,"No, not another spartacus movie!","All said, seeing Kirk Douglas in the most famous version of Spartacus, can make you puke to see all the versions made since then. This movie really is not that bad though. The actor is actually physically more in shape for this role than Kirk Douglas was, however the sets were just really not that convincing for me. It's too bad there has not been a remake of this movie that has done better than the original."
2,Not as entertaining as the movie with the same title that starred Kirk Douglas,This movie is not as entertaining as the one with the same title starring Kirk Douglas. The costumes showed this film was done with a small budget. It's not accurate to the history either. The acting was so so.
2,Spartacus Miniseries--Terrible Remake of A Classic,"I was really hoping that this Miniseries--Spartacus--a tv remake of a great film classic--""Spartacus"" which is one of my favorite films, starring Kirk Douglas & Jean Simmons would try to do it justice with this new version. Don't waste your time--this film is totally ""CRAP"" compared to the origional. With this being said--usually most origionals are the best anyway period. Again I repeat, this miniseries remake is ""CRAP"""
3,Black and white,Line drawings. The equivalent of a modern-day chapter book. Good for 2nd grade and up. Woulde be a good retro purchase.
5,Not the same as the green paring knife in the 4 knife set,I love these knives and was hoping to buy another set for a friend. The green paring knife with this set of 3 is a little shorter than the green knife I already have from a four knife set. Don't know if the product has changed or whether they are actually different.But they cut beautifully. Sharpest knives I've ever used.
5,easy grip,"I purchased these knives to add to my collection. My son-in-law was asked to carve the turkey on Thanksgiving Day and was quite disturbed at the quality of the knife he used so he gave me a set of Henckels for Christmas. Wow!! What a difference a sharp knife can make!! I love them and wanted to add more, and for the price, it was easy to do. They are colorful and I use them everyday."
2,"These are ""Made in China"" not in Germany",The knives are okay for the price but I do not like false advertising - on the blades and on the back of the package printed 'Made in China'. The seller put a big lie on the description.
5,Cheap & Cute Henckel's,"They cut sharp enough, it's just they're very light-weighted so they don't have the stability feeling which I think the only drawback if you expect something decent. Otherwise the price is right, you'll be happy with the well functioning colourful little knives!"
3,made in China,"even though the description wrote they were made in Germany, they were actually made in China. These knives are light, easy to use. the blades looked like white color but are actually chrome like other knife. having them for a month or so, they have been worked well for me."
4,nice little knives,I bought these knives sometime ago and since then I used them not only for paring but also for other chores that needs small tools. Nice thin blades....easy for me to sharpen and the price was just right...yes!
3,Disappointed in quality of knives,"I was disappointed with the quality of these knives. When I received them, the plastic handles looked and felt cheap. Even thought they are inexpensive, I still want knives I can use and enjoy.These knives are affordable, but for me, their quality and performance is questionable. I do not like the handles. They feel lightweight, generic, and substandard, and do not feel good in the hand when using the knives. As someone else mentioned, this is definitely the ""value"" line of Henckles knives, not the premium line, and you can feel the difference.I have recently discovered and fallen in love with the Pure Komachi knives by Kai. My Komachi knives have resin-covered handles and don't cost a fortune, but they don't feel cheap. These Henckels knives did.I'm sticking with my Komachi knives and am returning this set of Henckels to Amazon."
2,Pre-code Hollywood,"Films were just ok, but dated. Not that shocking considering what is out there today."
2,Mediocre Pre-Code Product,"I'd hate for anyone who is unfamiliar with Pre-Code cinema to start by viewing this collection. I found three films -- ""Hot Saturday,"" ""Torch Singer,"" and ""Murder at the Vanities,"" more than satisfactory. ""The Cheat"" is a pale shadow of C. B. DeMille's sadistic silent version of the same story. ""Merrily We Go to Hell,"" in which Sylvia Sidney plays a poor little rich girl who marries a drunk who never says he loves her, is one of the least likable films of any era that I have ever seen. ""Search for Beauty"" is a downright strange combination of Busby Berkeley and Lena Wertmuller cinematography without much of a story to hang it on. If you want to see some good Pre-Code cinema, start with one of the other collections."
3,Older But Interesting,In general I enjoy older films. All but the Cheat were interesting. The Cheat was more like a play. Each film got better as I watched them. The transfers are good considering the age of the films. C6
3,only ok,"compared with the 3 warner bro. sets,I was disappointed with these in comparebut then I'm a warner fan,although I know some movies were MGM but I'm also a big Norma Shearer fanthe first disc has spots on it after playing anyone know how I can get it replaced?"
3,naughty pre-code label can't elevate so-so films,"All the movies made in pre-code Hollywood have the allure of being naughty, whether they are or not and studios love to capitalize on that. Pre-Code Hollywood Collection ($49.98; Universal) jumps on the bandwagon with six flicks starring the likes of Cary Grant, Claudette Colbert and Tallulah Bankhead. The movies range widely in quality but you've got to like packaging that harkens back to old movie trailers filled with hype by calling them ""6 SHOCKING films from the Era Before Rules!"" Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
5,Colony Season 1,"I was completely captivated by this show. A really awesome concept involving the supposed Apocalypse. The cast are all very intriguing and it was great watching them critically think to establish electricity & other real-world problems they would face if this were real. I was skeptical about how accurate it was going to be because I figured that the people would realize that it wasn't going to last forever, but after a couple weeks they were completely immersed in the experience. Recommend!"
5,Great series!,"The Colony is a lesson to all of us about the possibility of life without utilities, water and food. This group learned basic survival skills and developed new and innovative ways of survival."
5,"Suppression is out, breathing is in. Learn why.","Suppression of emotion leads to disease - it is as simple as that. No wonder the medical industry wants us to remain suppressed! Pauline and David illustrate rebirthing, or conscious breathwork, as a method to efficiently remove disease from the body, permanently. There is simply no better method and no better book."
3,Le Voyage en Ballon,"I really enjoyed this film as a youngster. Also the musical score, which was available at the time on a LP record. Now not so much. The score is still attractive but quite limited. Worse, the photography is not nearly as good as I remembered it, and the story is so contrived as to be downright silly. Still, rather fun fifty years ago."
1,Frightening,"Though nearly 150 years old, modern psychiatry and psychology are, really, in their infancy. They'll scarcely grow much older if the occultism (using oracles), parapsychology, fringe thinking (UFOs? Why not crop circles?), and you-too-can-be-a-shaman marketing of Jungist analysis continues to entice people to spend small fortunes in years of discussion.Intellectually, this volume fails to make even a minimally credible case that such a thing as 'post-jungian' theory exists, except as a compilation of 'anything goes' jargo-ridden discourses. Avoid it in favor of work that has at least some scientific substance--and which doesn't come with huge price tags of interpersonal dependencies."
3,Keeping pace,"So what do you need a CD for? If it is as a basis for practice, this would be great -- the consistency of the pace is good, and the music is basic capoeira, rather than showcasing musicians. If you are looking for the full range of paces and rhythms, you may look elsewhere. Hypnotic and sound."
2,Uneven but well-intentioned,"This disc contains cover tracks by Shonen Knife and Bongos, Bass and Bob--the bassist of which is Penn Jilette, half of Penn & Teller. Other than that, it's largely forgettable and so wildly varied that it's not an easy or enjoyable listen."
4,Nice beginner workout!,"I'm just now getting back to pilates, after a few years away, and appreciated the variety in this workout! Today, I did the mat section and was surprised by how complete it felt! In addition to the regular pilates exercises, you will do side leg work, plank and push-ups for more core work, and gentle swan/cobra type moves for the back. Liz is pleasant and unintimidating and the matwork is filmed outdoors! Am saving the ball workout for another day, but I remember liking it, too! Quite a lot in this DVD, for your money and well worth it, IMO!"
3,Pug pooch in prison,"This costume is cute; however, the hat is difficult to positionand keep on the dog's head and the costume stiching is strainedaround the chest of my pug. All in all, it worked out fine forthe occasion."
5,Donald in Mathmagic Land,"This is a great DVD to get your children interested in math. I remember it when I was a child and how much I enjoyed it. My son is four and he has to watch it once , if not twice a day. As far as educational videos go, this is one of the best. Go ahead and get your child a copy today and see his or her eyes light up with the joys of math as only Donald Duck can."
4,Donald in Mathmagic Land,"Humorous presentation. It will be difficult for me to send it to my grandchildren, but I will do so, later. Received in good condition."
5,"Finally, Donald Duck on DVD!!",It is time to upgrade your classroom library. Move off of the VCR and get onto DVD!
5,Perfect for teachers,I bought this because my 2 daughters watched it growing up and loved it. Now my daughter is a 3rd grade teacher and needed something for her kids to watch which was fun and educational. The kids loved it and now other teachers have borrowed it from her to use in their classes.
5,"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!","A wonderful and inspiring look into the world of math, music, art, and architecture. I remember this film from my childhood, back when life was black and white, and only our dreams were in color, and was anxious to share it with my own child and my students as well. I learned a thing or two from this 'featurette' and when I got to college and actually saw a pool table, I realized it had changed my life forever.""Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe."" Galileo Galilei"
2,Disappointed!,I think we were expecting this to be more like the Disney short films and more fun. My son is a Donald Duck fanatic and didn;t like this one.
4,advanced cartoon,"cute movie, but very ""old school"" in terms of visuals. great information, sometimes too complex for an algebra class!"
2,Donald in Mathmagic Land,The video is interesting and educational but according to the instructions we are allow to play it only 5 times. I suggest to the company to give at least 20 times in order to share with the family.
5,Donald in Mathmagic Land,A classic. This video playfully engages children in the ideas of basic mathematics.
5,Disney at its Finest,"This is my favourite cartoon of all time, and quite possibly the best gift I ever received. I grew up with math teachers popping on this video everytime a migrane came on, and it got better with each passing year.I have countless friends that learned to play pool from Donald, and the animation can't be beat! This movie will really kindle a love of math in children and adults alike. It really is worth any price-- with any luck Disney will see fit to release it on DVD soon and introduce new generations of kids and drunk college students to the wonders of this one!!"
3,"Great Video, Poor Audio","There is an extremely slight, yet terrible echo throughout the entire video. I love the cartoon and what it has to teach, but the grating audio makes it nearly unwatchable."
4,Pretty good timer,"I bought this timer for my holiday lights, so I wouldn't have to worry about remembering to turn them on/off. It turns on at dusk and has several choices of when it will turn off, which is nice. My only complaint would be that when it turns on, the lights blink on and off for about 10-15 minutes before they finally stay on. I'm not sure if this is supposed to happen or if I got a dud, but it is a little annoying. I wouldn't use this timer for security lights because of the blinking when it first comes on. If you're buying it just for holiday lights, it does a pretty good job."
5,fast & easy,"As a busy new mom, I'm finding that I no longer have oodles of time to linger over menus for the week. This book has easy & nutritious meals already laid out for four weeks. I enjoy not having to think through what we're going to have for the next week. All I have to do is write down my ingredient list & head out to the store. I can only think of 2-3 recipies in the book that aren't tasty... if you have your own Fajita recipe, I would use it instead of the one listed in the book. Also, the apricot muffin recipe just doesn't seem to work as listed; the result is too wet. Our top picks from the book are the bagel/tuna melt and the chicken stir fry recipe."
4,"Engrossing story of a ""Black Widow""","I am not a huge fan of the ""true crime"" genre, but picked up this book because I just moved to Steamboat Springs for the Summer, and people still talk about this case. I was pleasantly surprised at how well-written the book was. It also was well researched, presumably, in part because, before his death, the victim had hired a private investigator to dig up the dirt on his ex-wife in preparation for a trial. The book is a fast-paced read, and would be enjoyable if you like this kind of book, whether or not you have ever been to Steamboat. The activities of this sociopathic woman are chilling."
2,Not as described fortune cookies,These are not as described which did not make me happy. They are NOT individually wrapped. They are wrapped together in a bag inside the box. I am the only one that eats them. Therefore they will probably go bad before I eat the box which means I wasted money....Not really happy about that. Tastewise they are ok...
2,"Good, but some stale cookies..","I ordered a dozen of these boxes early May of 2012. Cookies were individually packaged and packed box consistently of 12, but I still received a number of stale cookies. The ""best by"" date for all the cookies are July 8 2012. These leaves me with only two months left. I would expect at least a few more than two months on these.The cookies are tasty, but as good as Panda Express's. I would buy again, but they really need to send fresher cookies.5-31-12 update, ranked down from 4-> 2 stars. I'm getting a lot more stale and crashed cookies."
1,Not what I ordered,"When the box arrived, I was excited to open it and enjoy the cookies. However, the box didn't contain ""La Choy"" branded cookies as I had ordered. Instead, it contained ""Golden Bowl"" branded fortune cookies. A Great many of which were broken/smashed in some fashion. I did try the cookies that arrived and I did not like their taste. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed in the vendor who shipped me this order."
2,Good Product - Bad Shipping,My husband loves the fortune cookies and was looking forward to receiving these. When they arrived the box was crushed on two sides destroying over 1/3 of the cookies. The box was marked fragile but there was not packing inside to protect the cookies (basically just fortune cookies in a cardboard shipping box). Very disappointed.
5,A MUST read for new and veteran teachers,"Michael James D'Amato has written an easy-to-read, concise as well as imaginative educational book that provides practical advice to teachers young and old; to assist in opening their eyes to the creative, imagination and to stimulate strategies to inspire today's students.This is not a boring exercise in technical educational behavior- but an enjoyable fun read that will inspire you to use and adapt many of these fantastic strategies into the classroom. Anything that reaches a student is a positive and Mr. D'Amato's book contains great information and practical applications that will help in any classroom setting.Administrators, buy this for your staff. Teachers buy this for yourself or for a friend/parent. ... Get in touch with your students to succeed; this book will help."
2,Could be more interesting to read.,I was bored easily with this book. The cover looks very interesting...not so much on the inside.
5,THIS IS A GREAT SONG BY THE SPICEGIRLS,I LOVE THIS SONG ALOT espcially the single of it which i have.I like all of the remixes of the song but i definitely like the seven mins and twenty-six secs version.I mean it starts off cool with those cool sounds and bumping music then 2:17 into the girls start singing.I also like the way the remix music blends in with the song and how it comes together as if it was the song's original music.Like I said this a great song by the girls.
4,The biggest spice girls fan,i love their whole album i listen to it everyday i still have all their dolls and all their songs i will always be their number one fan
3,Definately not one of the Spice Girl's best singles,"This is definately not one of the Spice Girl's best singles. Stop, and Stop(MoralesRemix), are very good, but the last two aren't that good. On Stop(StretchandVern'sRockandRollMix), all they sing is, so you know just were you're going, and stop. And it's a very long song! And on Stop(MoralesDub), they don't sing anything. And that's a very long song too! So that's why I give this single three stars. I prefer the single with Stop, Something Kinda Funny(Live), Mama(Live), and Love Thing(Live). So buy that one. I wouldn't rush about getting the other one."
3,Not the girls best work,"It's not that good.In the third mix the only lyrics are ""so you know just where you're going"" 18 times and""stop""18 times.That song is 9:26 seconds long,and those are the words.The last track is 8:11 and is all music.Don't rush to buy it."
2,Wanted to give it 1.5...,Stop by itself is a decent song. But the remixes are horrible!Do not buy this overpriced piece of trash!
3,used book,The description of this book said it was funny--maybe really old folks funny. His type of humor didn't even bring a smile to me. Plus it said autographed copy. Does a sticker pasted into the front of the book constitute signed? It did come in a timely manner though.
4,Please Update,I really enjoyed the game on my old computer but now I have a Windows 2000 NT and cannot get it to work. I am hoping they will put out an upgraded game so that I can use it again. I really miss playing the game on my computer. I also have a high speed connection. Does anyone know if they will come out with an upgrade?
1,Will NOT run under Windows 2000,This game will run on Windows 95 but with the release of Windows 2000 and XP the game has to be put to sleep. Infogrames Entertainment has to come out with an updated version for the newer OS's and computers.This is a 19th Century game still being sold in the 21st Century.
1,Unusable Scrabble,"This product is terrible. It forces you to reduce the number of colors your monitor can display to 256, and then uses colors that make the text unreadable.It can not be fully installed on a hard disk making it necessary to leave the cdrom loaded whenever it is used.It is more concerned with making noise and animation than a functional game."
4,A Good Buy,"I really enjoy the computer version of the Scrabble board game. When playing against the computer, you can choose to play between one to three opponents, depending on how fast you want the game to go. Separate statistics are compiled for two, three and four person games. The game loads quickly, and the graphics are good, although the angle the board is set at can make it a little hard to read the point values of the squares. My only complaint is that your monitor must be set at 256 colors, so I have to reset this everytime I play the game...it's not a big deal, but it is a little inconvenient.I would definitely recommend this software."
1,Very Serious Problems,This program has a very bad interaction with the ZoneAlarm Firewall. It disables all network activity and forced me to reinstall Windows 98 to fix it.
2,My Scrabble abends a lot,"I am running Hasbro Scrabble on Windows 98 loaded on a Gateway computer. The Championship level doesn't work at all - it abends every time you try to select the first replacement tiles. The other 4 levels work ok, but the internet connection doesn't work. This was given to me as a gift, so it was free. You get what you pay for."
1,Completely Useless,This game purports to work on Mac and Windows. It did neither. My Windows 7 is too new for it and my Mac Leopard X I guess is too new also. It would not load onto either platform. And that is a shame because I really appreciate the game.
5,Gift,This was a gift for my Grandfather. And he enjoys it. Him and my grandmother switch gifts all the time!!
2,ABC,This is not the game that I thought it was. I was looking for another version of scrabble. I just have this one stored with my unwanted stuff.
1,Scrabble a dud on WIndows 2000,"I've had the Scrabble CD for several years and enjoyed playing it on every platform from Win 94 to NT. I've bought it for friends and family so we can play on the internet. But I'm unable to run it on Windows 2000, no matter how many times I change the color specifications, or how many .dll files I move around. Very disappointed. I've shopped for an upgrade but don't find one."
1,this is outmoded technology,this game takes over the screen and the computer in XP. It does not run in a window. It is an outmoded piece of software and should no longer be for sale. Scrabble is a classic but this software should be rewritten.
4,Runs under XP without a hitch,"Not a bad version of scrabble, to say the least, for a real nice price. I had some difficulty trying to install it under win2K, but under XP it works without any special incantations at all. Can't wait to see version 3."
5,my all-time favorite album,"Of all Madlib's works, and I've heard or own just about all of them, this one is my favorite. The first track just blows me away, and I've listened to it countless times over the past 5 years. It has the coolest samples, goes from jazz to psychedlic to reggae and back again. There's just nothing else like it. His medicine show albums are good, but mind-fusion vol.5 is just about the uniquest crate-digger collection masterpiece ever. I'm talking about track 1 mind you. Track 2 is pretty cool, it's live, the kinda album you can throw on for a party and just let it play. It's the yang to the first track's yin nature, ending things with a bang. Great version of Dilla's ""2 can win"". Like I said, this is my favorite piece of music, that says it all. Too bad there's just about no way to get it anymore, would I pay the $70 knowing how good it is? Yes"
3,Not the Best Calico Critters Set,"In comparison to the other Calico Critter sets, this is the least appealing in my book. It is a clothes rack (with a few extra clothes) and a stand up mirror. It also includes Camryn Caramel Cat. The 'magazines' are just folded paper and don't hold up well.There is not much to do with this and for the price, there are much better Calico Critters sets."
5,Brought me back to my childhood,This was a gift for my 3 year-old niece. She absolutely loved it. I love all the Calico Critters items. They're all so cute and bring you back to more simple times.
3,Bible,"I am pleased with the size and color of this bible. Two things I don't like: It does not have words of Jesus in red and the ""large print"" was not as large as I thought it would be. Order Giant print to get a larger print. I decided to keep it since neither of those two things will keep me from reading it. There was nothing in the description to let you know that the red text was not included. The footnotes are great."
5,very satisfied!,"I received this book very quickly, I loved it! It is exactly as described! What a great deal ... Thank you."
5,"Saint Joseph New Bible, just needs the book mark","I really love the book, the print is large and the only thing that would really add is if it had a book mark ribbon."
4,A little harsher ride after installation but great for the price,Gabriel product - and it wasn't too bad.Bit harder ride but otherwise good quality.Very Easy Installation.Both shocks were installed in about 15 minutes.
1,Be Warned,"These were bought to be used as name tags for a large holiday party. Only after the packaging is opened does one discovers that each name tag includes the warning, ""Do not apply to leather, suede, velvet, corduroy, vinyl, plastic or silk."" Nowhere on the packaging or in the product description is this disclaimer included. A customer is left with the choice to perhaps ruin a guest's or participant's clothing - or switch to another product. Be warned - Avery is clearly deceptive in omitting this warning on the outside of the packaging or in their product description."
1,NOT A GOOD SET,This set is not really cool. It has old face scans for all of them even when cowboy bob orton was a wrestler. Randy orton is in black just like nearly all of his others and the undertaker looks the same.
2,Listen to samples first,"I really should have listened to the samples before ordering this one. I was hoping for a compilation of original recordings (like TVT's Television's Greatest Hits), instead I got this really weirdly made ""remix"" list. Some remixes are better than others (right now I'm listening to the redone ""Superman"" theme by John Williams, and it doesn't sound too bad), but still, if you are looking for the originals, steer clear of this. I do applaud the people who put this together for trying -- it's just not my cup of tea. This *might* be good for someone 10 or under... just because they might not remember ""exactly how it goes"" -- but it mattered to me."
1,perhaps good for kids but not for paper engineers or readers,"your three-year-old might like this book, but it's not actually a book. It's a four-page spine-covered thing that folds out into a playhouse, more like a large greeting card than a book. There's no story, the paper engineering is not that advanced..."
4,Make that heavy on the mystic,"This is a nice old book with a 1931 copyright.It has aged very well and offers a different slant on the mystical Tsar. His argument about the major source of mysticism is not one that I particularly agree with, but that is ok.There is no bibliography and the titles of other books written by the author do not particularly lead one to expect a serious treatment of this subject. So that was a pleasant surprise.A good book to follow-up with is ""Imperial Legend: The Mysterious Disappearance of Tsar Alexander I"" by Alexis S Troubetzkoy.The style is entirely different but both head in a similar direction.This is a book well worth locating."
5,This is one of THE books on chess tactics,"Learn from the examples-- good and bad -- from the masters from Anderssen to Fischer, simple and complex, short and long, how to master piece co-ordination. A classic. Check out Chess Life and Review April 1975 p. 245 col 1 wrt #69. Working through this book can add hundreds of points to an average tournament players' rating, whet his appetite and keep him off the street for days... Not just for beginners, the 356 positions on 240 pages although not their primary source nor a dry categorical treatise, will challenge delight edify and entertain an interesting reader for years..."
5,The Ideal Bag for the Panasonic LX5; Leica D-Lux 5,"Not too big, not too small. Just right!Yea, just like Goldilocks.And room enough for a wrist strap.And a separate compartment for an extra battery & SD."
4,"Good, sturdy bag that protects camera but holds what you need.","THere's not need to say much about this bag - it is just what I was looking for for my Panasonic Lumix zs7 - a bag big enough to hold the camera, the cable, an extra SD card and the charger.It is quite secure and I feel like my camera is protected while in the case (though obviously not for any big drops or collisions) but it is also very easy to access the camera to pull it out for fleeting shots.The only issue is that occasionally the top doesn't get completely around the edges of the bag when the bag is not very full, but if you know that, and know to hold the bag snugly when closing it, the issue is insignificant.On the whole, a great product for what I was looking for."
3,One little oversight by the manufacturer . . .,"I really like the look of this bag, and for the most part it does what it's supposed to: hold a Canon G11 or equivalent, and in the front pocket store cards and/or batteries or whatever.My main beef is that though my Canon G11 fits snugly in the bag, THE NECKSTRAP DOES NOT. If you're like me and like to use your camera with a neckstrap, you'll have to jam the neckstrap in the bag before or after the camera goes in, then struggle a bit to secure the velcro closure.My secondary beef is the belt loop. I don't wear belts, so I wish the bag had a clip, not a loop, in the back."
3,tamrack camera pouch,Dogonnit! Not quite big enough for charger and extra battery and the camera itself. I will have to buy something else now
4,Nice - but small bag.,"I put my sandisk express in this, 2 chips, a charger and anything else to keep it in good condition."
3,purchase Tamrac 5292 T92 Camera Bag (black),I purchased the case as a gift for my daughter who needed a new case. The price and available is what caught my attention to purchase. It is a functional case for the protection of the camera and contents.
5,Just what you need,I got this for my Canon G9 and couldn't be happier. I especially like the room for my charger in the front pouch as well as an extra SD card. Also it has a velcro and Plastic closure device that makes me feel my Camera is secure.
3,It holds my Canon G15,It holds my Canon G15 except that the Canon's shoulder strap makes it a very tight fit. It would be nice if it just a half inchtaller in the camera slot so I could fold the camera's strap in there easily. It holds the extra battery well. I use the bag on my belt. I just wish the camera slot was a bit roomier. So I will probably be replacing this bag for one slightly bigger.
1,Too Big for Canon D10,"Contrary to the sizing chart on the Tamrac website that listed this product as perfect for the Canon D10 water proof camera, this was way too big for it even with all the accessories (charger, extra battery, cables, 6 SD cards) packed with the camera in the main compartment. The camera and all the accessories were bouncing around inside the case that the screen on my D10 ended up all scratched. It felt like it can fit another smaller digital camera in there. Camera bags are meant to be snug to protect the camera but this one was just too big for my new D10 that I had to return it without even attempting to use it since my trial run resulted in a big scratch on the screen of my D10. If you are buying this specifically as a case for the D10--DON'T! Save yourself the trouble of going through what I went through."
4,Nice product,"I would recommend this dvd to others who enjoyed his other dvds. Not as visually stimulating, but still much better than anything else you will find out there!"
5,A cinematic Rorschach test,"Be sure to set aside uninterrupted time in a dark room to watch this movie nonstop from beginning to end, no distractions. The most astounding movie I have seen in 50 years. Be sure to watch the eyes."
3,Not a 'Feel Happy' film,"I have probably watched 'Baraka' no less than seven times. With the announcement of another Ron Fricke film I waited in anticipation for many months until I could purchase 'Samsara'. Great cinematography, some good time lapse photography, but where's the message? Baraka had a great message of a beautiful world and many religions having some common threads. It appears that 'Samsara' was the antithesis of 'Baraka'."
4,totally worth watching,"It's a great movie, but i didn't do it justice since i watched it while doing chores. It's all images and requires all your attention. It also makes you think about a ""few"" things..."
4,Beautifully done,I was hoping to see more of the thousand-hand Guan Yin dance. In other respects if was beautiful and mesmerizing.
3,"Samsara okay, not as good as Baraka","I saw Samsara about a week ago in the theater. It was originally released back in September 2011 at the Toronto International Film Festival. I had checked out the critics reviews and most gave the thumbs up. Let me say I have seen Baraka and have it on blu ray and was blown away the first time I saw it. When I heard that Samsara was in production starting in 2007 I eagerly awaited it's release for 4 years. After watching Samsara, I came away disappointed. It did not have the same powerful emotional or visual effect on me that Baraka did and still does. I have watched Baraka many many times. Samsara seems to be image without coherence like one other reviewer has stated. To me the music also did not have that powerful emotional kick that Baraka does. The images are very good in Samsara and some of the music is good. I will buy Samsara on blu ray, but for me Baraka will always be the litmus test."
1,Amazon streaming stalls,"Apart from the beauty of the film, the download delivery hung up multiple times.Unfortunately, freezing on the chicken factory and cattle corrals; these are effective frames to prompt conversion to vegetarianism, but we gave up trying to watch after multiple attempts to jumpstart.."
2,A non-narrated documentary,"This movie is a random collage of scenes from all around the world. Beautiful places and images to be sure, but nothing more than that. After about 10-15 min, it gets boring and monotonous and I like Discovery-Channel-type movies. But as you watch, you want to know where these places are, who are the people, and what are the activities that they are showing, but naah! In any case, this felt more like a screensaver than a movie..."
1,Did not play!,"The service was excellent and the Blu Ray was brand new, however it would not play in our blu ray player because of a clash of regions!? You know it is being sent to Australia, and if the movie only plays in the USA it should not be allowed to be purchased in Australia. Now we spent money on something we have absolutly no use for! Not happy"
1,No narration and no titles,It's like a slide show of pictures without narration or titles. Photography is good but can't make out half of where its taken.
1,Photography scam,"Samsara stinks! It is nothing more than an exercise in photography. Boring junk, with funeral music. Do not buy this."
2,It's not what you expect.,If you are in the mood for stunningly photographed chicken processing - this is your film.The music was beautiful. The photography was beautiful. Half of the subject matter was beautiful.I did not expect to walk out of the theater shell shocked. The graphic images of mechanized meat processing were not ideal for a date night movie.Rough to swallow.
4,Self-esteem Builder!!,"This was a funny book. But besides it being funny, it was and is a good self-esteem builder. Mo'Nique is in love with herself...in a good way. Her self-esteem is where EVERY woman's should be--big or small. She knows who is she is and offers insights to women about how to get there. Good book."
1,Skinny Women Are Evil: Notes of a Big Girl in a Small-Minded,"This book is a prime example of an actor making an attempt to capitolize on her 15 minutes of fame to make more money. The book does not help big women, it only strengthens the existing misperceptions and prejudices. There are serious health risks to being overweight and Monique ignores that. Parts of the book are funny, but for the most part she is saying that being overweight equals being lazy. She sure uses a lot of profanity so be ready for that.The book is just trashy."
1,Mo'Nique is evil,"I understand her message that everyone needs to be comfortable with their body. I feel that the title of the book was so childish and the book was trashy. She wants people to believe that being overweight is healthy. I also hate when she uses the word skinny B**** that is crazy. Some of you may not agree with this ,but who cares it my opinion of the book."
2,Not as giften with a pen as she is with a stage.,"Mo'Nique offers the reader a unique perspective, but the book is written with a juvenile style that is a bit dissapointing (although easy to read)."
3,Feel good about yourself Mo'Nique does,This book is ok for what is was. Mo'Nique cracked jokes on her life and skinny women as she usally does when she is on stage. The book was not well written but she had a view good points. I'm a plus size woman and listening to Mo'Nique get on stage and tell big woman to stand up and be known makes me feel good. I'm not dissing skinny women but I do support her on her views about big women. We should feel good about ourselves just as much as thin women do. You don't have to be a size 4 to be sexy.
3,Evil huh?....,"Not at all what I expected. The sole purpose of this book seems to be to hate on skinny chicks, which MoNique defines as a size 8, which to me is medium. It did let me know a great deal about her personal life, which is why I chose to read the book, but I just expected more uplifting of thick chicks, which she did a great deal of, but a lot less hate. I love MoNique and her personality so this book was interesting and hilarious at the expense of anybody who's not skinny. She did have tips for big women, and lists of places to eat and shop. I recommend this book to every who's over a size 12!-Pryncez"
5,Oh Yeah!!,"Being a F.A.T. (Fabulos And Thick) woman myself, I am grateful that someone has decided to fight back for us. From her childhood trying out for cheerleading (""do you know how hard it is to get 200 pounds in the air?"") To her doing her stand up routine for the KKK, Mo'Nique is sure to open the eyes of many skinny women. I recommend this book for all of us BIG people out there!!"
1,A bunch of lies,"mo'nique is a phony at best. she uses fabricated stories of her family as a way to gain fans and draw attention to herself. if that book wasn't so far from the truth, i don't know what is. no matter where you go in life, you will always have your family. so instead of trashing them in a book, she should be happy they're around to see her success. dont villify them in a book just to gain sympathy from your bookreaders. in the end, you'll look more like a martyr instead of a hero."
5,"Fabulous, Thick and Funny","This book was hilarious. I never laughed so hard and cheered so loudly in my life. As a F.A.T girl full of confidence and loving myself, I could definitely relate to what she was saying. I never really thought of the Skinny Ones as Evil, but once she broke it down for me, I'm better able to relate. This book is highly recommended and I will be encouraging others to run...uhh...walk or drive out and get it. Kudos to Mo'Nique for keeping it real and telling us just like it is."
2,Dylan at Woodstock,"Looks like something taped from a tv-show, but the sound quality is not that bad.Only recommended to die-hard fans."
2,not that great,I saw the Show live - Bob showed up late - and it wasn't very good - Although the sky behind the stage was nice
4,Great Detroit acid!,"It a shame that this CD is listed under ""Hardfloor"" because only two of the tracks are actually created by Oliver and Ramon. However, the CD is a wonderful ""flash back"" to the days of the, then new 303 and acidcore laiden Detroit underground Techno scene."
4,Fits great on my Accord,It's great for the price. Good material and lots of storage.I've had it for more than a year and it's as new.
5,Perfect,My son wanted this for xmas. I could not find this item in stores anywhere. This was just what I was looking for
2,wrong description,i was looking for the visor with velcro strap and the description says this organizer has a velcro strap. unfortunately when i received it i found out that it has regular stretchy rubber band. disappointing
5,Very handy CD Organizer,"I like this cd organizer very much. Now I have several cds handy when in my car. The product was shipped quickly, and all in perfect order."
4,It's pretty good,Overtime the discs will get scratched more and more because the type of material it uses. I wish they used a softer material for the sleeves that the CDs are in so they wouldn't be able to get scratched.
2,Didnt even fit in my car,"Didnt even fit right on my mirror, cheap made but for price was worth a shot."
3,Block Vision,They hold a lot of CD's but when full they get kind of chunky and they block some of the vision as the visor can't fully hit the roof of the car so they are in your face some. I wish there was some awesome solution to CD storage in cars.
5,Rock solid advice from an expert,"Ellie Kay offers very practical, proven advice on how to get a handle on family finances. Those of us who are financial sloths view Ellie Kay as a coach who who helps us get into fiscal shape. She is funny, encouraging, wise, and effective. Excellent resource."
2,Want to know about George Jeffreys?,"If you want to know about the life of George Jeffreys, do not buy this book. Instead of being called ""George Jeffreys: A Ministry of the Miraculous,"" it should have been called ""Elim: A Ministry of the Miraculous,"" because instead of telling anything about Mr. Jeffreys, all it does is recount the first 14 years or so of the Elim Pentecostal Church in the UK.The book is not a biography. Rather it is a history book regarding the Elim Church: it's founding in Belfast, Ireland, and it's subsequent growth and move to Wales and England.I'd say that the only redeeming quality of this book are the eyewitness and personal testimonies of salvation and healing, and newspaper accounts of various crusades.If you want to read a good history book about early Pentecostalism in the UK, then purchase this book. If you'd like to read a biography about George Jeffreys, you'll have to find another book...then please tell me about it, because I'd also like to read it."
1,Might have been nice...,"If this piece from Madcatz had worked at all it would have been held in a higher regard. I received one, brand new, for my December birthday and was excited to use it for the first time with my Slim PS2. I have three friends and none of them like to watch other people play.Unfortunately when this multiport was in, the way the undetailed instructions demonstrate, I had problems. My gaming system (that has never had problems at all) became fussy about either reading brand new, just opened, discs or providing sound for the games. As soon as this multiport was removed, it cleared up the issue.I checked the package several times hoping to discover that it was just not for the slim PS2 or was in some other way incompatible... but it was the appropriate design and fit, as labeled. Therefore, this product from my experience gets a whopping 1 star for being a good gift... in theory."
5,Totally satisfied with CD,"The CD that I ordered came promptly and was exactly the product that I had ordered. Its condition was even better than I had expected, and the price was quite reasonable. I am completely satisfied."
4,Satisfied with this product!,"I think the design is very attractive and I set it up on my countertop with my most used cookbooks. The only thing that would maybe make it better would be if it allowed for the books to lean back a bit further for easier view of it. But, in essence, I love it!"
2,Pretty but..........,"The cookbook stand is very pretty and would have looked awesome in my kitchen. It may have been ok for smaller, spiralbound books, It will not support a hardback cookbook when it is open. I sent it back."
1,Not effective for small or medium sized cookbooks,"This cookbook stand is extremely wide. While the desctiption gives an accurate depth measumrent, the pictures are deceiving. If you are using a standard (medium) sized cookbook, this stand will not hold your book open. It is so wide that the pages fold closed and when you try to adjust the position of the book, the book falls forward and out of the stand. If you are using an extra large cookbook, the width is okay, but the book still falls forward because the stand is not tall enough to balance the weight."
5,"Holds books well, doesn't take up much room",I like the elegant design as well as the fact that it almost take up no room when it's not being used. Holds cook books as well as single pages recipes well.
2,Could be a great item,"I ordered this for my son's girlfriend. After we tried it out, I decided that I need one for myself! After using it with a hard covered cookbook we realized that the angle of it wasn't good. The book kept tipping. Perhaps with a few bends in the right place it could work out okay."
4,"Reinventing rock, making music history","Yeah, truly the most out standing and the most innovative sound I listened to all through my life. FNM have absolutely been writing rock history for those few years and this edition will certainly be a real classic in the future. Some songs may be missing I think, but the selection is, I must say optimal, especially for those who are newly inroduced to FNM. Do not hesitate if you want to hear moody, emotional, courageous, confident and powerful rock - it's some sort of its own genre. A must have..."
4,Fine board book,"My little one loves this book of ""sheens"". He calls out the opening page's statement ""Hey, you guys!"" and can identify every one of the construction vehicles in the book. Like all Barton's books, it is simple, clear, direct and easy to follow. And like all his books, it shows all types of people doing these construction jobs: black, white, male, female. Subtle statements of equality (see, Planes and Trains, each of which feature women and minorities in prominent jobs like pilots and businessmen) and opportunity abound.Good stuff for the little one to learn, even if he just likes looking at the big trucks."
5,Fantastic!!!,"My son loves this book. We have incorporated sounds for each page, which he loves. We know which picture is coming up, because he makes the sound that goes along with it in eager anticipation. This book goes with us on car trips, long and short."
2,Not the full size book,"Rip off. I assumed these were full sized. They weren't....they were mini versions of the board books- maybe it said that in the description somewhere & I didn't pay attention. But a few years ago BJ's had these large board books for $8, so this is not a good deal at all. Besides that, the books are fine. My 3 year old son had them and loved them so much they're seperating from the spine. Was suppose to be replacements, but we're have to see how the pocket versions go over."
4,Still using this book years later,I used this book a lot when my girls were little. I bought this book back in 1997. Now that I have a new baby I pulled it out of storage. This book is the best. I found myself using it for my 9 year old when she was running a fever. This book works for babies as well as older kids. This is a wonderful book for new parents and experienced parents.
5,The Best!,This is by far the most helpful book dealing with children's health that I've seen (I bought quite a few). A great resource for identifying those middle of the night illnesses that scare the heck out of you.
5,Your Child's Health,"""Your Child's Health"" is a great resource. This book saved me many trips to the Doctor's office.This book was a baby gift that helped me through the fears of ""something is wrong with my newborn."" My baby is now 15 months old and I still refer to this book first and will continue to use it for many more years to come. It helps will newborn problems all the way to adolescent problem.""Your Child's Health"" has a great index that is easy to use. You are easily able to find what you are looking for. The book also advises you on when you need to call the doctor and if not, how to treat the problem at home. Of course, you always need to rely on your own instincts, but it is a great reference, especially if you happen to be a worrier."
4,Can't live without,"The books was recommended to me by the nurse at my pediatric office. She said when I call her up to ask questions, she refer to this book. It is a very easy to read and a lot of good information just to refer to day to day things. I am a 1 time parent and I think this is a handbook for a new mom. For this much money, it is really worth it."
5,Indispensable practical book for parents.,"When our oldest child was born, our pediatrician recommended this book and it has been our bible for almost nine years and two kids: we've worn out 2 copies. Addresses not just medical questions but also general parenting for all ages: best bottom- line advice I've ever seen on issues from discipline to child care to weekly allowances to freedom/responsibilities for older kids. Very practical guidelines for each illness or medical situation on when to call the doctor immediately, when to wait until office hours and when and how to treat at home. Also great in helping you organize what is important to tell your pediatrican when you call in for consult. Terrific first aid and trauma advice in clearly written, bulleted format.I've bought MANY of these as gifts and everyone has really used and relied on it. Unlike any other pediatric guide I've ever seen. A whole-hearted recommendation."
5,A Pediatric Nurse Raves!,"I use to work on the Pediatric floor of a local hospital for over 15 years, I wish I had known about THIS book then! A few years ago I started working at an ""advice"" nurse line. This book was used to create some of the Pediatric guidelines. The nurses call this book the ""Pediatric Bible""!The first time I used the book was for a call about a child with a ring stuck on her finger. I told the mom what to do and it worked! From that time on, I have told parents to get this book. If you don't have access to an advice nurse line, I highly recomend you get this book. The information is easy for any parent to understand. It's straightforward information to ease any parents mind.One of my co-workers even gives this book as part of a wonderful basket of goodies for baby showers! What a great idea!!!"
1,BORING!!!!,"This CD is really bad. First of all his voice is really grating on your nerves. He sounds like he lives in a trailer park down in the south somewhere. And the matieral is not funny at all. It might be funny to his redneck friends he plays it for, but for someone that has a little intelligence, it's lame. If you want to but a funny prank phone call CD try the Touchtone Terrorist. Tom Mabe stinks!"
4,"Yakima Cargo Box Hanger, Great solution","This product works great. Before buying it I read several reviews. Some suggested that it would be just as easy and a lot cheaper to fabricate one of my own. Seemed simple, just buy a pipe (very easy) and a couple of hangers.Therein was the problem. After visits to TrueValue, Ace, and the Home Depot, I realized that I was wasting my time and gas money and having no luck at all. So I ordered it and it worked just fine. I use the Cargo Box to travel between two homes. I'll be adding another hanger at the summer place."
2,No Strap?,"I bought this rip off. It's nearly imposible to attach to the DSC-F828. And then comes the surprise, it doesn't come with strap or the little attachment that carries memory sticks ect. Very disapointed."
5,FABULOUS!,This is a fun way to get to know James better.I love this DVD because I love James. Wish therewere more DVD's. Can't wait for a 3rd album.
4,Packaging shortcut causes confusion,"The Bosch ICON & Marathon blades are very good blades. Just be aware that the Bosch ""OE"" blades 20OE, 22OE, 24OE, 26OE, etc] will not fit any vehicle with a J-hook type of arm. For those you need just the plain 20, 22, 24, 26, etc.What causes this confusion is that the instruction sheet that Bosch includes in the package also includes instructions for the J-hook style arm. One would assume then, that these blades do adapt to a J-hook arm, right? Wrong. It's just a cost cutting measure by Bosch to send along the same instuction sheet for ALL types of arms for ALL of their blade models. Pretty dumb decision on their part. I played around with these a long, long time trying to make them fit until I contacted Bosch and was informed they were the wrong blades. An accurate instruction sheet would have prevented all of this.Good blades though.M"
3,Double check fitment,"This does not fit the 2006 - 2010 BMW 650i as stated. Apparently, there are numerous versions from Bosch, each with its own nuance for compatibility. The 22 OE does not work. Worth noting, there is a notch system in the wiper blade arm that prevents interchanging passenger side and driver side blades as they are suppose to be 22"" and 24"" respectively."
5,Best Price on the Net,"There are a number of companies selling these renal vitamins. The vitamins are needed for ESRD sufferers, but NYOTC has the best price(includiing shipping) for them."
4,Great deal,This is a great value. Local stores are 3-4 times as expensive for the exact same thing. This is my 2nd time buying this and will continue to
4,Same as 20 gauge Hanger at local hardware store to much better price,"I used these to hang some shelf supports in my garage. They are lightweight but more than adequate for the job. A warning however, they do bend easily so avoid hitting them directly with a hammer. Can't beat the price"
5,I love these!,"Like Bob said at the end of DVDs, my children 3 and 2 have watched these DVDs over and over. They learn many songs from singing along with the Cedarmont kids. For some, this may looked outdated as it was filmed quite long ago, but I still love it because my kids get to see how kids in the past look like. I also bought their song books and play them while my kids singing. As a pianist, I love the arrangements, simple yet creative. Nowadays, there are a lot more DVDS made that have kids singing. My kids also watch and love some of those; however they learn most of the songs from the Cedarmont because there's less animation. SOme may like something more animation, action, and more complicated instrumention. It's just a matter of taste, I guess!I always recommend Cedarmont to my friends who are looking for Christian DVDs to buy for their children."
4,A Matter of Opinion,"My 2 year old niece loves these DVDs. My sister in law uses them at church in Argentina with the little ones who love the Spanish dubbing. They are upbeat, my niece dances or wiggles along with them, and they are songs with a positive message.I would suggest buying one, and seeing if your kid likes them before investing in the set. I can see where some kids would prefer the motions, but some kids just make up their own. The CDs are great for car trips, all 5 of my nieces and nephews like those."
4,Music is good but kids look like they're stuck in the 80s,"My 19 month old son likes this DVD collection. However, he only likes the fast songs. The collection is very thorough and has a lot of good songs on it that we want for him to know and he will eventually hear again in Sunday School. However, the look of the kids should be updated. But, this doesn't take away from wholesomeness of the songs and the quality of the product."
5,Fitness You Can Do,"Rochelle Rice's book offers realistic things for plus-size women to do. Her approach is thoughtful, moderate, and smart. Truly an expert on fitness for the plus-size woman, Rice has provided a book that will help women of any size love their bodies, feel healthy and stay active. This is a must-have book."
4,Just started the book!,"I just got the book but I am almost tot he ""start program-6 weeks"" and I love the information, personal experiences and thoughts. Almost every time I am thinking the exact words that are written. Its easy to read and follow..as a plus size female who has tried everything I would recommend this book to everyone and anyone who is a ""real wmone with real curves""!! thank you!"
2,some good stuff,"although the book starts out ""sympathetic"" to women, the term women of size i believe is very derogatory. in one moment we're telling women that they are ""real"" as the title denotes then we p rogress into saying they are of size. there was some good information in here but the title is misleading at best but i guess no one would buy a book for exercising poor fat girls. let's get a grip..."
3,Too soon to say,"We just got this unit as a gift and I'm amazed to find there are no reviews online anywhere! It seems to work pretty well so far but our biggest complaint is the loudness of the microphones. It's pretty easy for my kids to drown out the music with their singing, so then the music gets turned up louder and the racket begins. There's a built-in volume limiter on the CD player itself, which is nice, but I just wish we could control the microphones. Of course, we're talking about a 5- and 2-year-old, so there's some issues with controlling noise already, but still, they're the age the toy is designed for. The unit also can't function at all without the ESP activated - skips and stops - so I'm sure that will eat up the batteries. I'll be looking to buy an AC adapter. I'll be curious to hear what others think, because there are not many things like this out there that have the two microphones - a must for us!"
5,excellent quality and so much fun!,"i bought this cd player for my 5 year old after a lot of research.i am very happy with this product. the quality of the sound is excellent. the microphones work great. the machine is extremely durable (my 2 year old uses it, too). my daughter loves to sing along with the music and can carry it around while she sings. i have been using the microphones to call the kids to dinner and when it is time to go! they think it is hilarious and actually come when i call them. i would recommend this without hesitation."
1,sing a long cd player,This cd does not work. I am waiting for Amazon to send me a return receipt. Very disappointed as I paid 50.00 dollars for a defective product.
2,"It's ok, but has a flaw","This was a Christmas gift for my 2 year old, so she could listen to her Fraggle and In the Night Garden cd's during quiet time. Worked fine for about a month, and now the power button wont stay engaged. A piece of packing tape kinda fixes the problem, but for that kind of money, I shouldn't have to. It will become pretty useless when she's a bit older and wants to carry it around. So for now it sits on her dresser, for use once a day. I could have gotten a cheap plug-in cd player for about a quarter of the price. Really dissapointed. Oh, and it sucks batteries. So yeah, I wouldn't get this if I were you!"
1,Quit working,"My daughter gently played with this for only a few weeks before CDs no longer played. She was so disappointed and I am angry. Of course, we can't return it so we are stuck. At least the microphones still work."
3,Good toy but needs tweeking,"My son enjoys his CD player and it is very durable. However, there are a few things I was disappointed with. It does not come with a cord so you have to go buy an adapter or use batteries all the time. Also, there are no individual volume controls for the microphones which are quite loud. We had to just take them off because they were really too loud."
5,Great toy,"Okay, my grandson is above average. Seventeen months old and he hasn't destroyed it yet! It's a too-cute CD/Sing-Along Player, although all -he- does right now is put the microphone very close to his mouth and go, 'Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.........' I wholeheartedly vouch for this one. It's speckled-puppy cute and durable as well."
4,fun for my two performer girls,I like everything about this CD player except the fact that the voice volume cannot be adjusted. We went out and bought an AC adapter to save on batteries. My two girls (4 and 6) love the dual microphones and I'm sure will get lots of hours of pleasure from it!
2,CD player broke the first day!,"I bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday after reading several reviews. The reviews were mixed, but I knew that she would love to hear herself on the microphone. The first day she got it it tumbled off the table and the CD player stopped working right then. The microphones still worked, but what use is that without the ability to sing along with the CD's?? I am returning it and won't get another one. This toy is too expensive to have broken so fast!"
1,Sing Along CD Player,"I bought this CD player for my granddaughter for her second birthday two weeks ago and it is already broken. One of the microphones broke the first day and now there is a cracking noise when the player is on, and every time you try to lower or raise the sound it gives a horrible cracking sound. I thought maybe it broke because she was carrying it around and dropped it, but, my daughter said it is too heavy for her to pick up and it is left on the table. For the price I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Major design/safety issue,This item was fun while it worked but broke after 10 days. It has a major design flaw in that there is no way to lock the cd door - so kids can open it while the CD is playing. The hold switch mentioned in the product description refers to the play/stop/FF buttons not the open button. I think it's potentially dangerous for little fingers and how ours got broken.
2,Not worth the money,"Bought this for my daughter because she loves to sing and ""perform."" This has horrible sound for playing CDs and the microphone is WAY to loud. It was not worth the money--at all!"
1,A lemon I guess,"I bought this for my 3 year old for Christmas and it wouldn't play CD's. It just made a clicking noise. I was very disappointed in this on Christmas morning. I wish I could have sent it in for an exchange but my only option was a refund. I am awaiting a refund but I wanted to go ahead and order another one since this was one of her main gifts and the price for it has gone up $[...]. So, I am ordering a completely different one from a different company. This was not a good experience for me."
3,Good enough,"These work OK for my daughter who is 2, but the microphones don't have a volume control so sound drowns out the cd playing. The microphones have started making a popping noise when you use them. A little annoying, but my daughter doesn't seem to mind."
1,Company is replacing it,I hope our experience is not indicative of this company's overall performance.The cd player did not work right out of the box. They were prompt in responding and (in theory) are sending us a new one.
1,Microphones broke after 2 days,"My son loved this. Unfortunately one mic did not work, and 2 days later the second one broke. My son was devastated and it was a gift so I can't return it. Hard to explain to a 3 year old why his toy is already not working. Very disappointing. Wish we could get replacement microphones"
5,Very cute and practical,I loved this product. It is robust enough to withstand a three year old's temper tantrum and what I love is buying a book and then recording it in AUDACITY and sending the book and disc to my grand-daughter to hear me read it to her. I would recommend to all grand-parents.
2,Bad sound quality and microphones quit after a day,The sound quality was horrible and the mikes stopped working right away. Now we are buying the fisher price because a friend has had really good luck with that one.
1,Too Fragile for Children,"My 3-year-old daughter received this CD player for Christmas. It is a wonderful idea and we enjoyed it while it lasted. However, one microphone broke after light use in January. The other, sadly, broke last night while a friend was over. These microphones have very fragile wiring which caused them to short and then stop working completely. The cords are also too short for a toy intended for small children. If anyone attempts to take even a few steps away from the player while singing, it strains the cords and pulls the player off of its resting surface. This toy is not nearly durable enough for small children and is extremely over priced considering the quality. We are very disappointed."
4,Good CD player,"This CD player is a bit expensive, considering it's for a child, and might not last as long as a product for a responsible adult. However, it seems to be built/designed well, so hopefully it will hold up to the activity of a child. The buttons are easy to use and my daughter likes that she can carry it around with her. The only thing I don't like is that it can't be plugged in, so there's no other way to use it than on batteries."
4,Great for young children,Had to take the first one back because one of the microphones broke. Really should be more indestructable for preschool age. But they love it.
1,Songs pause and skip and eventually dies. Don't waste your money.,"We received this as a xmas present from the grandparents. At first, it was wonderful because we used it as a CD player primarily for play time and bed time. In less than a month, the player would make a weird humming noise, pause and completely stop. My daughter would wake up because the CD player stopped in the middle of her lullaby. I do not recommend this CD player. We didn't even get to the microphones but you may not be able to use them because the CD player will break before then."
2,No real volume control on microphone,Haven't used the product enough to determine if there are quality issues but I was very disappointed with the volume control on the microphone. It was so loud that we had to unplug the mics and hide the toy. There's a volume control switch in the battery compartment but we weren't able to notice any change. Extremely annoying. I would look for one with a true volume control on the microphone.
1,Save your money,"This CD player is a piece of junk. We have trouble getting any CD to even play. As much as my 3 year old loves music I was really hoping for an exciting Christmas morning, but was very disappointed. The microphones are too short and only one ever worked. Sound quality is poor. It does not even come with a plug to plug into the wall. Super cute and was hoping to have something portable but for the price I expected much better quality. Save your money. Google the singing machine...around the same price and much better quality."
4,Neat!,This cd player is really fun. Both of my kids love the microphones that come with it. Compared to other prices for kids Cd players this one was pretty reasonable! It seems pretty durable and plays cd's very nicely~!
1,doesn't work - going back,"Bought this for my grand-daughter; Christmas gift. Put the batteries in, the power light comes on, the microphones work, the CD spins, but no music. Absolutely no sound at all. Just mailed it back today."
1,Great concept - if it worked!,"I bought this for my 4-year-old daughter and she LOVED it. She was having a blast playing her music and singing along with it in the microphone. She even put on a little show for us. It was GREAT. Then, an hour later, it suddenly stopped working. It just died. The CD player wouldn't respond at all, the disc wouldn't spin, none of the buttons worked, the LCD didn't display anything. It was just dead. We tried changing the batteries, plugging it in, nothing worked. It's really too bad - it would have been a great toy.I read some other reviews before buying this and hesitated to buy it because I read similar reviews - it died after very little use. I decided to try it anyway. I should have followed my gut and NOT purchased it. Thankfully, I was able to return it for a refund. Now my daughter desperately wants another one, but I'll have to find a different one - I won't try this one again."
2,expensive supposedly designed especially for wear & tear,paid $50.00 for the toy. supposedly designed especially for young children. grandbaby loved it. it was easy for her to use and worked well in every respect. well designed even had volume control.really fun with two working microphones. only used 10-12 times. she loved playing her own music. this toy was at grandma's house and did not see much use. only played with it one night a week. only went through 2 sets of batteries.stopped working suddenly. too bad. really fun for my granddaughter. never dropped. didn't last a year. the disc would spin and them shut off without playing. very unhappy. she loved it so much that i am risking buying another one but i am keeping the packaging. i'll write back about how long this one lasts.Sing Along CD Player
1,Dlx Sing Along CD Player,"Toy is defective. CD skips. Kids loved it when it played part of a song, but then it stopped or skipped."
1,Awful! Never worked,Very disappointing as out of the box with brand new batteries it would only play a cd for 30 seconds and stop then wouldn't play anything at all. Just awful - so disappointing. Sending it back same day as it arrived!!
4,Good for the classroom,"I bought this last summer for my kindergarten classroom. It gets used daily in our listening center. The kids knew how to operate it right from the start without any help from me. It has handled use and abuse from 16 kids for a year now with no problems. The sound is great and I love that there is a volume lock in the battery compartment because kids can still adjust the volume but it doesn't get too loud for my small classroom. The only reason I didn't give it the 5th star is because of the cost and time of having to go out and get an adapter to be able to use the cd player. Overall, a very solid product that I would buy again if I had the need for a 2nd player."
4,Great for little ones!,I bought this for my 3 & 4 year olds. They love it. It is pretty durable and the cords are fairly short so it keeps them from being stretched out. Unfortunately my kids wanted to pull the cords further. But it has held up well.
2,Two in a row broke,"Great idea - when it worked. Sadly our first one broke a few months after we got it. We liked it so much we bought another one - broke again. The part that plays the CD is really not durable. Also, I got it for 60 bucks, so anything over that seems ridiculous!"
2,Broke in less than a year of infrequent usages,"I bought this for my three year old in July 2009. My son's nanny used this during the morning time about 30 mins to get him to sing and dance. and in Early April 2010, my nanny told me that the cd broke. she does not know why. The disk refused to turn. The CD player was not abused in anyway. I expect this CD Player to last longer than a year but it did not. I am really disapointed."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this item for my grandson, who visits 2 x week, for a Christmas gift. The first one stopped working after 1 m. I initially was told by Amazon that we were past the return date,since we purchased it in Nov. I called the company and was able to get another one sent. It has been played with for almost 8m. and has stopped working again. Our grandson is so upset. It was his favorite toy."
1,"High hopes, sad Christmas","My 3 year old only asked for two items this Christmas, a doll and this Sing Along CD player. Santa delivered. Unfortunately, when we put in the batteries, the player didn't work at all. Not a light, not a sound. We even tried a second set of batteries just to be sure. I guess the elves forgot some wiring in this one, because it's a dud. It's a good thing there were a few other gifts under the tree, because the ""big gift"" from Santa was a big disappointment."
1,waste of money,"I paid a lot of $ for this toy thinking it would be a superior product. However, it just stopped working after several months. The light is on to show the unit is on, however, nothing else works anymore. Very disappointed since the price was so high. Also, it was never very easy to use and the disc cover popped open very easily."
1,don't buy it,"I bought this item for our grandson for christmas, he used it 5 or 6 times before it stopped working.I bought it from an Amazon seller and unfortunately she did not stand behind the product. My grandson is disappointed and I have a useless toy I paid $64.00 for."
4,Great toy for 3 yr old,"I bought this for my 3 yr old granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it and was immediately able to operate it. She especially liked the microphones. Unfortunately, after about a week, the machine started cutting in and out alot and there was a buzz in the microphone connection. I contacted Growing Tree Toys by email and received an immediate response, return authorization, and a new unit mailed out the same day. The new player works perfectly and my granddaughter takes her ""Carry Okey"" with her everywhere."
1,Not very good quality,"My daughter only played with this item for a couple weeks and then it stopped working, even when we replaced the batteries."
1,The CD player that won't play,"I am so disappointed in this toy. I was looking forward to my boy being able to play his own music, but it didn't even work Christmas morning. We put the batteries in, a cd, and pressed play, but nothing happened. The box was pitched before I could save it, so now I am stuck with a machine that does nothing."
3,Becoming more irritated the longer we have it.,"We bought this last xmas for the kids (18 mo and 2 1/2) and they love it!! As a mom who paid for it, I am not that impressed.Pro's - It is pretty durable and well made as far as the body of the player. It has been dropped and knocked over and it still works so that is a plus. It is light enough for little ones to carry around. The batteries last a pretty long time even when my kids leave it on.Con's- The microphones have now stopped working Not sure what we are going to do about that now. The volume on the CD player doesn't get very loud so when you are playing you can barely hear it when it is on the loudest setting. I guess that is so it doesn't annoy parents too much but it would be nice if you could actually hear the song. I think it is way over priced for what you get and I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Missing one key component! Annoying.,"Overall this is a decent CD player for a little kid, but it does have one unforgivable drawback: it does not come with a power adapter. So if it gets used (or left on) a lot, you'll end up buying tons of batteries. I went to Radio Shack and spent another $25 on the AC adapter. Otherwise I would have given it five stars."
5,Superstar,Bought this toy for my 1 1/2 granddaughter. Thought was a little pricey until she kept dropping it and dragging it and it still worked fine.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this item for my grandson based on the favorable reviews. I ignored the negative reviews, as I felt that overall it looked very educational, and durable. However, when it arrived, it operated for about 20 minutes and then stopped working completely, just as the negative reviews had stated. I was very disappointed as it was a gift."
1,Worked for 1 week.,It was a great toy for the 1 week my son was able to use it. After very little play time the CD player stopped spinning. Wouldn't recommend this toy. Hard to see the sad look on my son's face now that he can't use his favorite Christmas present.
1,Never Worked,"We bought this for our three year old for Christmas. He loves to sing and dance. The product LOOKS durable and very nice. However, it never played a CD. It wouldn't spin. We tried several things but gave up. Amazon returned the item through UPS with no problem. We werent able to do an exchange though since it was through a third party seller."
1,If it only worked,"I had read some negatives before but this was best rated one and it was cute and nice until you turned it on. The CD stops all the time because the anti skip kicks in and that is while it is sitting one a table. If you move it, it refuses to play. It did this constantly with any CD. If you turn off the anti skip feature the disk refuses to play at all. I am mad that I wasted to money on batteries and now I need to replace it with something for my daughter."
1,Lemon,"Unfortunately, I got one that only lasted two weeks with no abuse. I bought for my 4 year old granddaughter who loved it, but it broke after only two weeks. I am very disappointed, considering most people had wonderful reviews on it. It was great for the two weeks it lasted."
2,Broke after six months,I loved this toy and then it broke after only six months. My daughter wasn't rough with the toy. It just didn't seem to stand up to normal one-year old use and abuse. Also the cd volume wasn't loud enough. Would not recommend.
5,very nice gift,I bought this last year for my little great-granddaughter. She immediately loved it and I'm told that she stills plays with it. It is durable and entertaining.
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this CD player and I had read some reviews that it had stopped working. However, I still ordered it thinking that was an isolated case. My son loved this CD player, especially because he could sing along with the microphone. However, just as other reviewers indicated - it stoppped working a few months after I purchased it. We still have it - my oldest son is 6, we just use it for decoration."
1,Disappointed,"I brought this Sing along CD play for my 4 year old granddaughter as a Christmas present. The microphones worked fine had great sound quality, but it would not load or recognize any cds. We tried numerous ones but it wouldn't work. I should have listened to the comments I read before I purchased this item. I will buy her a karaoke machine from Walmart instead."
4,Fun Fun,"Both my kids love this toy. They love to sing, very loud, and dance around with the music. The only problem are the control buttons. It's a little tricky at times. i also think that the manufacturer should have made some sort of child proof locking system to open the cd part. My kids are always taking it out and playing with the cd. so sometimes i cant let them play with it alone b/c im worried they will break the cd or do something else with it."
2,NOT worth the money,"There seem to be a lot of great reviews for this cd player, so maybe we just got a lemon. I bought ours 3 months ago. Within 10 days one microphone was completely dead, and now neither of them work, for seemingly no reason. I have two girls who are not too rough on their toys, so I have no idea why the microphones just stopped working. As far as a CD player it is fine, the batteries last a fairly long time, but my girls just do not choose to play with it nearly as much as I thought they would. It turned out to be the MOST expensive toy for my daughter's first birthday, and the one that is played with the LEAST."
4,Kid's CD player,"My granddaughter enjoys using it all the time-she casn listen to books whenever she wants,though she says they read to fast. The ony thing I would like to change is the amount of volume there is on it, it is awfully loud. The cassette player is much more quiet."
1,not like what I bought in the store,"I purchased this candle at a local store and absolutely loved it. It had dried apples and cinnamon sticks all around the outside. It was so pretty that 2 family members noticed the candle and not the new ceramic kitchen floor my husband had just installed. Since the store no longer had the candle in stock, I ordered three online as gifts. I am so disappointed that I will be returning them tomorrow. They look like they were made by different companies. There were hardly any apples or cinnamon sticks in them. The dried apples that are in them are a third of the size compared to the one I bought at the store. I feel like I was sent the rejects."
1,Flat No,"The box says multiplayer so I brought this one home to play on an impromptu 2 player network along with a friend. Unfortunately, multiplayer means ""3 or more players"" which is written nowhere on the outside of the box. Sooo, in a nutshell my 1 friend and I are hosed. No stars here!"
2,Not Very Fun,"This game gets old after playing about five times. The options may sound great, but the game offers a lot and delievers very little. The battle sequences in the Ultimate mode are (to put mildly) crap. The same old 3D video sequences over and over. I wouldn't have bought it, if i could change the past."
1,Defective,The CD-Rom Disc is defective. It installs nicely...but then won't play. Wish we could leave a better review for this company. Sorry.
3,Could be better,"It seems often that the computer players are designed to attack me first. Even when another computer player might have just gotten all the territories in a continent, the players will focus on me. It does also seem like the dice rolls aren't random. Also for some reason, when I tried to save a game, all the slots are filled with gobblegook which I can't delete or replace. I tried reinstalling the game with no difference. When Risk gold edition came out, I bought it but had the same problem with the save. I like the expanded maps and I don't know why they didn't keep them in Risk II."
3,NOT good enough,"They should have included more tracks from the Mal Vida and Hiperespacio albums. Where's ""El fuego y el amor""? How could they miss THAT obvious hit? This is not a bad album to start with, but some tracks that they count as ""hits"" clearly don;t belong here."
5,Wonderful Story,I found this story to be well written as I could imagine it taking place in my mind. I read the book in two sittings because I couldn't put it down. The book has a perfect balance of suspense and love leaving you to guess the next event but not always being right. I hope there will be a sequel as I am now very interested in the lives of these characters after this novel ended.
5,Well Worth Reading!!!!!,"Story was very well written. I couldn't put the book down. I read it in one day. Each chapter left you needing to read the next one to see what was going to happen next. You felt as if you were in the story yourself living a part of the action along with the characters.If you buy this book, you will not be disappointed."
4,4 stars for Durschmied,"I read the ""WHISPER OF BLADES"" which is the U.K / EU version of this book.I guees the most true and interesting sentance of the book on every chapter. The KING asked the adviser "" WHY A REVOLUTION IS HAPPENING ON MY WATCH "" adviser answers "" YOU BROUGHTED ON YOUR SELF ""."
1,Bad Description,"The knife is not a Tradition knife. Rather, it is a Signature knife. Amazon has the wrong knife with this description. The picture is the knife they ship but it is NOT a Tradition."
1,the five star reviews seem a little suspicious,"Except for the crazy punctuation, don't those two five-star reviews read suspiciously like press releases? I'm willing to believe that there's some rabid Hulk Hogan fans out there, but the fact that both blurbs praise a cast that includes Ed Begley Jr. and Garret Morris is really pushing it."
1,Pathetic.,"This movie is beyond pathetic. Hulk Hogan thinking hes Santa Claus helping the SMALLEST orphanage ever? Pfft. Go watch No Holds Barred, its much better than this crap."
2,swiss miss cocoa mix with marshmellows,"When made as directed, with water, it is at best a mediocre beverage.Made with milk is slightly better. The flavor is best described as""mild"" (I even consider using the word bland.) The marshmallows areextremely sweet, give some froth to the mixture, but still, theentire beverage is ""lacking."""
3,Healthier! But... not as yummy,"We are avid cocoa drinkers here in Alaska, and I thought I'd try something a bit healthier for my family. Fat free sounded like a good choice and the price wasn't too bad so I went ahead and bought some. Unfortunately we weren't too thrilled. For some reason it seemed to be a bit tasteless (I guess fat adds flavor?). There were a decent amount of marshmellows, but they didn't make up for the absence of milky goodness that most Swiss Miss hot cocoas have.Even so, if you're looking for a slightly healthier alternative to normal Marshmellow Lovers Swiss Miss, this might be the stuff for you. My family is full of picky eaters, so even the slightest change of taste causes kitchen havoc. But if you're family is a bit more easy going, they probably won't mind the difference and will appreciate the fact that it's a bit healthier for them."
1,Little value for the money,"You actually only get 8 servings per fairly large box. The separate bag of marshmellows seems like a good idea but takes up way too much space. Very inefficient, and thus expensive. This review is more about the general value than the fat free product. This goes for the regular Swiss Miss Cocoa as well. Look to get more servings for your dollar."
2,Overpriced,"I would recommend that others not purchase this device. It is too expensive relative to a multifunction AC adapter.What voltage does this device provide? The manufacturer does not publish this information -- probably in an effort to drive up sales. I find that practice of hiding an electrical device's specifications to be obnoxious. Brother does it as well.One you know the voltage and power specs, you would be better off buying a multifunction adapter instead. Someone please publish these here and we'll all be able to save some money."
3,A Real Musician but a Secondary Performer,"I remember Georgie Fame and the 'Blue Flames' well from my pre-Beatles youth. He has a strong sense of rhythm and of musical adventure and works with both jazz and latin materials as well as with blues and up-tempo numbers. I am not surprised that he made a good career as a music director for other bands. His boyish appearance on the album cover is pretty much of a piece with his vocal deliveries: he seems more of a 'cover' singer than a groundbreaker. Having said that, I found 'Yeah, yeah, yeah' buzzing in my head for days after rehearing it. Listeners can learn from hearing him working with different material in an engaged and intelligent way."
4,Charming Smokey Voice,"This compilation covers Georgie Fame early period 1964-66. Apart from two track his first studio-album ""Fame at Last"" is here in its complete. The rest of the compilation consists of selected tracks from his two 1966 albums ""Sound Venture"" and ""Sweet Thing"" and of course some of the great non-album single tracks, such as ""Yeh Yeh"" and ""In the Meantime"".Fame is a great singer - lovely smokey voice - and with the right material he's simply irresistable. His early single hits like ""Yeh Yeh"", ""Get Away"" and ""In the Meantime"" are as danceable as ever - seems like music like this is not recorded any more.Just as charming as the singles are album tracks like ""My Girl"", ""Sitting in the Park"" or ""Sweet Thing"".Everything is musically perfectly performed by the great Blue Flames though some tracks like ""Funny How Time Slips Away"", ""Let the Sunshine In"" and ""Pink Champagne"" may come out a little like fillers."
4,Good item,"It doesn't bother me so much that it doesn't have a ""My name is"" written on it. I am pretty sure people would understand it on their own. It is priced correctly and gets the job done, it is the cheapest i could get on amazon so I went for it."
2,Not what I expected...,"I expected the labels to have the ""Hello my name is"" on them like in the picture, but it just has a wavy red border. Then I found out it said ""Do not apply to leather, suede, velvet, corduroy, vinyl, plastic or silk."" Now I'm stuck with 100 of these."
3,Not like the picture,"These are not what the picture shows. They do not say ""Hello, My Name is"" on the top. I should have read the reviews before I ordered them!"
2,Cozy Wannabe,"The cover art is the best thing about this far-fetched story. The characters are one dimensional, the plot a real stretch - with all the murderous and bloody activity and bizarre leaps this novel still comes out as dull and lacking. While the beautiful Irish setting and the charm of the Irish people should provide a rich backdrop, the scenes change too quickly to be savored. Even translator Torrey Tunet's fascination with language seemed trite and contrived; she was stiff and not particularly unlikeable. The police were insultingly inept; the debauchery of the villain was so vile that it didn't even make good reading. A ""cozy"" wannabe that simply does not make it."
3,An intelligent cozy,"A pleasant surprise for this cozy mystery fan! So often this su-genre is represented by fluffy, silly novels. Not so with ""The Irish Cottage Murder"", the first in the series. This is a story with substance, interesting characters and a heroine that's a real person, faults and all; how refreshing! The suspense builds well throughout the book, with some unexpected twists along the way. An especially enjoyable aspect of the main character, Torrey Tunet, is her job as an translator, and her amazing knowledge of numerous languages. This is woven in to the story in fun (and sometimes extremely useful) ways. You'll enjoy this book if you are looking for a good cozy mystery and a great many-layered puzzle to figure out."
2,Fat letters and globs,"I use markers in my business and find the large bullet tips to cause my writing to be sloppy. Therefore, it is back to the chisel style tip markers.Note, these markers do not malfunction but are just not my preference."
4,calico critters,have tried to diversify the families of critters that live in her dollhouse. since she has fisher cats in her area i thought these would be a nice addition
1,"Watery, lacks flavor. used in senseo coffee maker.",I was shocked by the lack of flavor and the tea-like coloring. Weak in all respects. Forget this product.
2,Maybe just a bad one?,"We purchased this water bottle for our 5 year old daughter to take back and forth to school. The first day, the plastic around the nozzle cracked and leaked. My husband was able to glue it back together and it works fine, but not sure for how long. Would expect a Polar product to have better quality than that."
4,school bottle,"bought for my son to take to school, wanted double wall to keep water cold, and not sweat. Didn't keep water super cold, so bought an insulated sleeve to go over it. Problem solved, keeps ice and water and no sweat!"
3,Bad bottle if you like to take big gulps,"This bottle is great at keeping your beverage cool. However, if you're like me and you take big heaping gulps of water whenever you drink from it, you'll find yourself running into the ""vacuum problem"". The nozzle is an old-school pull top so it doesn't have an outlet for vacuum pressure that builds whenever water is being drawn out quickly.If you're a big gulper, the Camelbak Podium Big Chill is a better choice (I own it also). Otherwise, this bottle works fine."
5,Great product.,"This bottle is great and keeps the water cold. I had was I went with the 24oz bottle instead of the 20oz because the price was only 20 cents more. The problem with my choice is on my bike the 24oz has to be squeezed into place because it's slightly bigger and the position of the screws on my bike are in the middle rather than slightly back, so I should have went with the smaller one. I didn't think the extra inch would matter but it did. So if in doubt about which size to get, go with the smaller 20oz bottle."
2,Repeating Problem with the Spout,"Over the past couple years I've gone through a few of these bottles. The spout is the biggest issue. You lift up the spout to drink and that's all well and good. But after about a year of regular use, I've noticed that the spout does not stay up when you drink it. Even when you lift up the spout, it sinks back down. When you're in the middle of drinking, you have to forcibly keep the spout open or else the flow from the bottle to your mouth is reduced to a trickle.I thought it was a one time thing. But now after experiencing this with my last two water bottles, I'm going to purchase a different product. I do not recommend this bottle."
2,Does not provide much insulation.,"Used it for few rides during mild summer days. Those bottles only provides slightly better insulation value than non-insulated bottles. However, since it is only few dollars more than regular bottles, I guess I should not complain much."
1,Provides almost no insulation,"This bottle provides almost no insulation. When you fill it with ice to the top and add cold fluid, the ice is completely melted in 3 - 4 hours. This has meant drinking warm liquid while playing the last few holes of golf under the Florida sun."
5,Great for daily use!,"I bought my Polar Bottle 9 months ago after being frustrated with tops that are hard to open and sweating on the outsides of my water bottles. I use my bottle daily to measure the amount of water I am drinking. This is the best bottle I've found for daily use. It keeps my beverages cold- up to two hours with filling it a quarter of the way with ice cubes. I find it very easy to fill from our water/ice maker on the front of the fridge. I love the loop on it, I use it to attach to a caribiner clip on my purse. It is not 100% spill proof, but is good enough if you don't want to just toss it in your bag. The size is great, it fits in my car cup holder (though does not fit in my husbands whose car can only hold a 12 oz can) and I do not feel like I'm running for a new glass of water all day. I love the sport top because I can share my water with my two year old in the car without worrying about her making a mess. All in all I highly recommend this as a daily water bottle!"
5,Works Great!,"Couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. These bottles keep things cool even in Orlando, FL heat. Made the mistake of filling the bottles about 2/3 on our first 2 hour ride and we were running out of water because it was mostly still frozen.I'll re-state what an earlier reviewer stated though... make sure if you're buying the bigger bottle you have at least 10.5 inches between the bottom of your cage and the frame above it. I have a 52 cm frame and it fit in both cages, but the vertical one is a close call. My girlfriend has a 46 cm frame and only the one diagonal cage and it fits but it's highly unlikely it would fit in the vertical bar if there were a cage there."
3,So So,"This bottle feels great in the hand,very easy to squeeze and fits snug on my specialized rib cage pro. As for the insulating part(NOT GOOD)they should not advertise this bottle as an isulating bottle, this bottle does not keep my water cold for more than like 45min. (that is icluding it being in the refrigerator for an hour or so with ice in it as well) so if u are looking to purchase an insulating water bottle that keeps your water cold this one is not for you. other than that i love this bottle for what its worth, i have 2 and it is always good to carry a full 48oz's of water with you without having to carry a Hydration pack."
2,returned item,This water bottle sweated so much that I dropped it the first time I tried to use it.Amazon refunded my money with no questions asked.
3,No big deal,"When I read about this water bottle before purchasing it, I thought this bottle would keep liquids colder longer than my current water bottles. This wasn't true. Maybe it was partly due to the fact that the temperatures this Summer have been rather brutal. As far as I could tell this bottle only allowed me to tell which type of liquid was in each bottle on my bike. I will give it another test once the temperature range decreases to the range of 70-80 and see if the results are better."
5,Keeps my drink cooler longer,"Great price and they work great. I live in Texas, and it is hot in the summer. Using a regular non-insulated water bottle, my drink would get hot within 25 minutes. These keep it cool for about an hour or so in really hot weather and longer in mornings when it is cooler."
3,Water bottle,Doesn't keep the liquid as cold as I would hope. Ice melts after a short time. Wish it keep things colder and longer.
2,Polar-Insulated Water Bottle Doesn't Work so Hot...,"........or should I say.........it does work ""hot"".........my cold drink did not stay cold as long as I'd like......and I was indoors, using it in my classroom. Using it outside on a bike ride or walk would be worse, in my opinion. I returned it, along with the other two I was going to give as gifts, if it had worked well. I'm still looking for the perfect water bottle."
2,Don't waste your money...,"I'm obviously in the minority here, but I don't think this bottle keeps water cold any longer than any other water bottle. Further, you better have strong hands to squeeze it, because, to me, this bottle is painful to my hands. I have a Trek water bottle that I much prefer over this."
2,polar insulated water bottle,this product doesn't keep water cool for very long. even put bottle in refrigerator over night before using. probably stated cool for about an hour in texas heat
5,Very Happy,"I received this about a week ago and have been to the gym 5 times with it already. Very happy with the purchase so far. No problems and it doesn't leak, even when in my gym bag sideways. Insulation does a good job keep water from getting hot even when the bottle is in my car, in the sun, in Georgia, in the summer."
2,Tastes like plastic!,"I've tried in earnest to rid the bottle of the plastic smell (and now the dishwasher soap smell that has infiltrated the plastic), and it's still not wearing off. I order the Liquid Motion ""color"" because it was the cheapest - maybe that's why it was the cheapest. Some people have stated that their bottle didn't taste like plastic - I'd be curious to know what ""color"" they purchased. I think it keeps the water fairly cold, but I don't think it keeps the ice from melting at a slower rate than other water bottles."
2,"Was good for a bit, but now smells and tastes like plastic","I was very happy with this bottle at first, but after using it for a couple of month, I noticed that the inside of the bottle started smelling strongly of plastic. Soon the water was smelling and tasting like it too. I don't feel comfortable using this any more, because it really feels like I am drinking BPA-infused water. Also, I haven't really noticed it being that insulating either. The water was just as warm as in my other regular bottle. So my recommendation to other buyers would be to pay a couple of extra bucks and get a real Polar bottle or another kind, but not this item."
2,"Keeps it cool, but leaks on my bike","I have 2 of these water bottles, and I love that it keeps my liquids cool. It's just that the lid somehow allows the liquids to leak out just a bit. So by the end of the ride, I have sticky gatorade residue along my downtube. I'd rather have warmer liquids than have to wipe off my bike after every ride."
4,"leaky, leaky","I ordered four of these to use at Disneyland in April and one of them leaks from the cover. They kept my water cold since I added a lot of ice, but my wife's bottle didn't stay that cold. My daughters leaked repeatedly. I guess 3.5 stars really."
4,chills for about 2 hours but plastic smell/taste lingers on,i like this bottle because you can take apart the mouthpiece hole and wash it separately. it keeps my water chilled for about 2 hours and that's with ice. which is fine because this is my gym water bottle use. i've used this for a few weeks and there is still a plastic taste and a plastic smell. i've rinsed this in hot water and soap each time i use it with no luck in removing the plastic taste and smell. not quite 5 stars.I prefer the camelbak podium chill bottleCamelbak Podium Chill Bottle. it doesn't retain plastic taste and smell. keeps my water colder than the polar insulated water bottle but the one thing i couldn't stand was cleaning the mouthpiece. it's not removable because of the anti-leakage technology. another product that isn't quite 5 stars.
5,Polar insulated water bottle,Goog deal on this water bottle as it keeps water cold and is flexible I have no complaints about the product or the seller.
2,piece of crap,"This water bottle was purchased to replace a lost Camelbak bottle. Its a piece of garbage compared to the Camelbak. It insulates well, but it doesn't seal well, so it leaks in your bag no matter how well you tighten it."
1,Begins leaking after a couple of months...,"I bought two of these in May, 2011. Beginning after a month or so, the lids had to be tightened progressively more in order to maintain a seal. After another month or two, it became impossible to tighten them enough to prevent leaking.I called the company and a helpful, sincere woman said that she'd heard something like this recently and sent me two new bottles and a return label to send back the bad ones.The replacements worked, and ultimately leaked, as well as the original ones.Obviously a bad design. Too bad.They represent a good compromise between a stainless insulated bottle (heavier and difficult to drink from) and an uninsulated plastic one (sweats and loses cooling or heat).I found no problem with the taste of water, even after a few days. And I'm fussy."
2,So-so,"These bottles are just ok. I wouldn't buy them again. Sometimes they leak and if you freeze water in them, they still sweat. They don't come close to my favorite stainless steel bottles from 'the flylady'. Those don't sweat, leak, and are reasonably priced."
5,Awesome water bottle!,I've gone through several water bottles before finally settling on this one. This one is the perfect combination of a squeeze bottle and an insulated plastic water jug. It is the best of both in my opinion. It insulates pretty well considering it's a squeeze bottle and I would say it keeps liquids cold about 4 - 5 times longer than a normal squeeze bottle would.The squeeze mechanism works great and I have had no problems getting plenty of water out of it easily. It's a great deal for the money.
5,Great Water bottle,This water bottle is wonderful. The insulation keeps your beverage cool for hours. I am an avid cycler and this is the only bottle worth using on those hot summer days! You will not regret the purchase. Plus I love the pink color!
4,Great,"I like the water bottle. It is great. The only problem I had was it doesn't keep the drink as cold as the product markets. It does keep it cool, but not cold."
4,Decent water bottle,"Decent enough, pretty average, I'd say. For the few dollars I paid for it, it was worth the money. Though the water bottle itself looks as if it's cheaply made. Despite how it looks, it works well enough. :o)"
2,Liked at first - now the bottle smells,"No matter what I do i cannot get the smell out of this bottle. It may not be leaching anything, but it must be porous enough to absorb odors and not let them go. Trying some Sigg bottle cleaners to see if I can get the smell out. It was a great bottle until the odor arrived."
4,Polar Insulated Water Bottle,It is great for a decent bike ride. My suggestion is freeze about half the bottle with water and then fill the rest with water.
4,"Functionaly good, appearance poor","First let me say that the water bottle functions well. It keeps things cold and is easy to use one handed. I also like the fact that you can remove the valve and clean the thing thoroughly. The only drawback of this bottle is the asthetics. I was a little disappointed that the graphics on the bottle are simply a piece of plastic stuffed in between the two layers of insulating material. As a result the plastic is wrinkled and looks somewhat sloppy. With that said, I didn't buy it for looks, I bought it to stay hydrated and it does that well."
5,Great BPA free Water Bottle,I have been very happy with these water bottles. I was a little hesitant because people in previous reviews said they had a really bad plastic/smell taste. I washed them in the dishwasher and there is no odor or weird taste and I am usually sensitive to those types of things.
3,"Ok, but found a better bottle....","I originally purchased (2) of these for my new road bike. On the positive side: they hold a lot of water. As some have mentioned, I fill with about 1/3 rd water and lay flat in my freezer. Keeps the water cold for my 1 - 2 hour rides. Overall, it's not a bad product, however, I found a much better one. I tried one of these:Camelbak Podium Big Chill 25 oz Bottleand immediately fell in love with the Camelback product. The difference is the water flow. When riding hard and reaching for water, the Polar bottle requires much more pressure to deliver much less water flow. The CamelBak bottle requires less pressure and delivers great water flow. For me, the CamelBak was a better product. So, I would give the polor bottle 3-stars based on how much easier the CamelBak bottle is to use. BTW, I placed an order for a second CamelBak bottle as I liked it so much better."
3,insulaton,"I used ice and cold water and ice cubes melted quicker than I expected.I did not note the temp. and it is warm here in vagas, anyway still better than uninsulated bottles."
5,best water bottle ever,I don't think I will ever buy the old kind of water bottles again. I like these so much that I have baught an additional 3 of them!
5,Polar Bottle,"This bottle is awesome. Fits perfectly on my bike, keeps water cool (even on long hot rides), pretty durable. Awesome."
3,Very much an average water bottle,"I bought this for my duaghter who is an avid soccer player. She used it for the first time last weekend. I filled it with half ice and half water. By the end of her match, two 22 minute half's, the water was only as cool as the tap. I was disappointed. This was an indoor match so the water bottle wasn't even exposed to the sun/heat of a typical outdoor match.She has a Thermus brand stainless steel insulated water bottle for school that keeps her water ice cold for over 24 hours."
1,"Leaks, leaks, leaks","Great idea, horrible execution. I finally threw mine away because of the leaks between the cap and the bottle. What a waste."
5,High quality! Great Price! No Chemical Smell! Nice Friction Plastic!,This is a great water bottle that does not smell and has a night friction to it that help hold it into your bottle holder and in your hands. The only thing I noticed is that the plastic is more opaque than in the product pictures but this would not disuade me from purchasing again.
4,Defective insulated bottle?,"Great build quality, easy to clean, and looks freaking cool. But for some reason the bottle I got couldn't keep it's coldness for more than an hour in 80 degree weather...maybe it was a ""defective"" bottle? lol. And yeah, I screwed the cap on that sucker pretty hard, so no possible leakage there...Seems like most other reviewers really enjoy the actual amazing insulation capabilities, guess I was cursed with a bad one! Someone enlighten me!"
4,"Less sweat, leaky top","I wanted a water bottle that wouldn't sweat as much while on my desk at work. This water bottle is perfect for that. It keeps my drink cooler longer, and there is very little sweat produced, even when it is filled with ice and it's a hot summer day. When I filled the bottle with ice and then water, my drink would stay cool for several hours - I would usually drink it all before the drink became warm, though all of the ice would melt.My biggest complaint with this bottle is the leaky top. I don't think there is a rubber seal where the lid screws on and I almost always have water leaking out of the top when I tilt my bottle. If it's in a bag or somewhere where it won't be standing up perfectly straight, there is often a little liquid that leaks out. I wish they had installed a rubber gasket of some kind to help with this problem. Even with this problem, the no-sweating feature sold me on this bottle and I'm a fan and I still use it."
2,Not so polar,"I am giving this bottle 2 stars, because it seems to hold water fine.However, ""polar"" it's not. As soon as you put ice water in, you will feel the outside of the bottle get cold. The insulation in virtually non-existent. Needless to say, the contents warm up at pretty much the at normal rate for a non-insulated bottle.Bottle rating: fine. Insulation rating: scam."
3,"so so, hard to squeeze","Keeps stuff cooler longer and looks cool.Problem, its harder to squeeze and get liquid out fast. I drink a lot of water throughout the day and after a month + I was starting to get carpel tunnel in my thumb from having to squeeze the hell out of this thing so much.Its design makes it so you can only squeeze it in the bottom halfs mid section and its a little stiff due to the double layer plastic and less area to give in on the squeeze.I ended up finding a larger no squeeze bottle for work - which worked out nice. (Rubbermaid)"
2,Disappointing,"Purchased 2 of these insulated bottles in different colors. Works aesthetically but fails functionally. The patterns are attractive, and the shape allows for easy grasping which even my toddler can manage. However, I've filled with ice and cold water expecting to have even COOL water after a couple of hours later...not so, water becomes lukewarm after an hour or so. I've filled with water and frozen, and the ""keep time"" is only marginally better. Perhaps my expectations were too high based on other reviews."
3,Disappointed,"I bought the 24 oz. bottle. I am disappointed that it does sweat a lot and leaves a puddle on my desk. Also, I filled it completely with ice, then with cold water, and even in an air conditioned office, the water was warm after 4 hours. I expected it to last longer. Last night I filled the bottle half/way and put in the freezer, then filled with cold water this morning and at noon I still have cool water. I do like the wide mouth which makes it easy to put ice in. I will keep looking for the perfect water bottle!"
2,polar insulated water bottle,"I did not find this product to be very good. The bottle sweated a lot, and it did not keep the water cold for very long; not even in an air conditioned house."
5,Polar bottle,"These bottles hold their chill for an extended period and are very durable if (or in my case, when) dropped on a hard surface. Gatorade appeared to stain the inside lightly, however, did not effect the performance. I would definately buy again (and I already have three of them)."
4,It works!,This is a water bottle you put water or any other liquid in it. So lets get to it.Pros+ It holds your liquid!+ No Leaking I have thrown it my bag and put it on bike and it hasn't leaked. Not a single drop has dripped out!+ Fits in my water bottle holder!+ Has loopy thing?+ Loopy thing easily removedCons- It's very tall! I wasn't expecting it to be this tall.- Has loopy thing?
4,Works okay keeping drinks cool; leaks under pressure.,"I wanted an insulated water bottle mainly for soda and gatorade to take to work. I usually put 4-6 medium ice cubes in it w/ refrigerated drinks, and with the insulation on this water bottle it keeps them cold for 4hrs at room temperature. For that purpose it works really well. However a fatal problem I had with this bottle is if you put soda in it, and that soda shakes (from say sitting in a car drive) it will leak from the threads that the top part screws on with. The actual nozzle doesn't leak, just the threads, which is odd. Under normal use, say just some water you tip upside down squeeze with the lid shut - it doesn't seem to leak. I have the insulated camelbak podium bottle too, it also has a leaking problem (from the valve - not the screws), but the podium seems to keep the drinks colder for longer periods of time (4-5hrs vs 3-4hrs)."
2,not as good as they used to be,"I'm a big fan of these bottles and have used them for several years. Recently purchased these and found that the quality control seems to have lapses. Threading and tops are crooked and do not fit well, resulting in leaking."
4,Good water bottle,"I gave this bottle only 4 stars because it's hard to clean. After a couple of months it started tasting bad because it wasn't fully clean, the different drinks I put in there were absorbed into the plastic which was really annoying. The one redeeming quality was that it kept my water cold and it felt right in my hand. It fit nicely into the side pocket on my backpack. I do recommend it despite the taste."
4,Bottle,"It's a cycle bottle, what can you say. Fill it with ice and your beverage will stay cold for about 2 hours in 80 Deg. weather. 5 or 6 ice cubes alone will be gone in 20 minutes."
3,"Does a pretty good job in insulating, but lid tends to leak","So this bottle does a pretty good job in insulating cold water. My major problem with this is that for some reason, the lid doesn't always screw on tightly enough. I believe that this is because of the plastic ring handle. So what ends up happening is that even though I would screw the top portion as tight as possible, more often than not, water still leaks out. Sometimes it's a little bit, sometimes its a good amount of water. It is definitely an annoying problem to have."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered 4 of these bottles based on reviews but find that they are extremely poor at keeping beverages cold for more than 30 minutes. I then tried putting them in the freezer filled but that only added 15 minutes, just the time it takes to thaw. Save your money."
1,Makes the water taste like plastic...yuck!,"My husband bought me this bottle last summer when he bought my bike too. I used it most of the summer, but recently got a Klean Kanteen stainless steel bottle. They are great! The best part is no plastic taste for stainless steel. For just a few dollars more, you can have colder, great tasting water that stays cold, and doesn't taste like chemicles in your drink. If that much plastic is leaching toxins into your water, can you imagine how much is getting into your body when you drink your daily water out of there!!! Yikes! No wonder why more and more people are coming down with cancer."
1,The Worst Product All Year,"This is the worst bottle I have ever used. I was trying to be good, use less plastic bottles, buy an ""American made"" product. But this bottle is so terrible. I hate it so much. It leaks, no matter how tight you try to seal it. This piece of crap thing just leaked all over my notes. What a waste of money. What a waste.Other problems: smells disgustingly like plastic; when you wash it with soap, it smells like the soap. It will even taste faintly like soap. This is so terrible. Don't buy it. If I didn't have a back up bottle, I would go straight back to using regular single-use plastic bottles. This bottle of mine is getting recycled."
2,too big,"I had hoped to use this water bottle on a hike in the mountains but it is too big and there doesn't seem to be a way to carry it unless you are on a bike, the price was good so it would cost me more to return it then to keep it albeit I probably will never use it"
1,Cheap,"I bought these and was astounded at their quality. They are just normal plastic water bottles that you can buy at Walmart for $0.75. They did not leak, just did not impress me. I am still on the hunt for a good insulated water bottle...wish me luck!"
2,Water bottle fail,"I'm a biker and have other bottles. But I got this one to just keep by my computer so my ice doesn't melt. Liquid flow is a little slow. I'm not sure why as the spout is a good size. The bottle itself isn't level when sitting on a flat surface. So it wobbles a bit. The top doesn't screw down totally tight but also doesn't leak.The double-wall insulation on this bottle is a joke. If ice is put inside, it will sweat, just like a non-insulated bottle. So this negates one of the entire reasons I paid $8+ for this thing. It's got cheesy tinfoil-type material between the walls of the bottle which appears to not really do anything."
1,Hard to clean and dry out,I bought two of these for riding because they looked pretty cool. They fine as water bottles. But the problem is the clean up. The inside plastic container has 30-40 little dimples that are very difficult to dry and clean. There are also unnecessary edges/curves that also make it harder to dry out the bottle after using. Definitely a design flaw in my opinion. If you put anything other than water in these bottles be prepared to deal with mold growth both inside the bottle and in the cap. We probably have 10 other odd water bottles in our house and none of them have had these kind of problems.
4,"Worked well, happy with purchase","I bought a bunch of these water bottles for a family trip to the Grand Canyon and they worked well in relatively tough conditions. The temps were in the 80's while we were there, and in direct sun it was sometimes scorching. We found that by filling the bottles half way with water and freezing overnight (with the caps off) we still had ice 4-5 hours later. Performance overall was very good, I would recommend them. Cold water is way more refreshing than warm."
3,"Wouldn't Buy Again, Probably","The bottle holds water fine. Looks nice. Don't see that it keeps ice much longer than a plain old bottle, though. Stuck it on bike this morning. About 80 degrees and drove 50 minutes to park. Ice was melted. Water not warm but close. I could try freezing bottle, I suppose but that would probably shorten its life. I like the bottle but would look for cheaper without insulating qualities next time. Only 3 stars because I expected better insulating power."
4,Polar Insulated Water Bottle,"Everything I anticipated...had already looked at them in a sporting goods store. The price was, of course, much less here on Amazon!"
3,Not great at keeping water cold.,"It doesn't work all that well, unfortunately, when it comes to keeping your beverage cold. I started a 20 mile bike ride (in southeastern Louisiana, mind you) with this bottle filled to the brim with ice and water topping it off. At our 10 mile break, the ice was completely melted and the water was only slightly cool. Pretty disappointing, but the bottle is easy to grip, provides great fluid flow, and is very easy to clean."
3,"Does not seal well, only use outdoors or with a poncho","These do not seal well unless you use the jaws of life. I have 2 of these bottles and use them at a professional office. It's a gamble to drink out of these because at any moment the Polar Melting Icecap may go global warming all over your shirt. I still use them everyday, but with caution."
5,Water Bottles,These are the best water bottles. Fill them 3 quarters full and put them in the freezer. Then take them out to use and you have cold water all day!!
3,They hold liquid... sort of.,"I purchased two of these a few months ago and they do serve their intended purpose. However, on the down side, they leak. There is a poor seal between the bottle and the cap and water leaks out at that point, dribbling water or whatever you put in them on you, and also on your bike when riding as the liquid sloshes around. Sort of hoped for a little better quality for the price."
4,Stylish Water Bottle,"There are many things that I really like about this water bottle. The design is eye-catching, unusual, I don't mind carrying it in public and because of the little strap, it is easy to carry. The shape of the bottle is ergonomic, intuitively shaped to the human hand. If closed, the bottle doesn't leak when tipped over and no water condenses onto your table or other furnishings when you set it down. I like the pull-out nipple you drink from, it is reminiscent of the disposable plastic water bottles I used to like in the store.In short, I like everything about it except for one thing which is what kept it from 5 stars: for an insulated bottle, it doesn't keep your water cold very long. If you add ice, you can expect about 3-4 hours of coolness (less in summer, I imagine). This means I am constantly adding ice which I find annoying. If you don't care whether your water is cold or not, this is a 5 star bottle."
4,Pretty good,This is a decent water bottle. It keeps your water cool but isn't super insulated. I'll probably get a different one that has an inside column that you can freeze.
3,It's Okay,"I'm not a water bottle expert but with all the hype I guess I expected better results. It works for my bike rides but, I'm only an hour or two riding. I like the 24 oz. capacity and function of the bottle."
4,Good but nor great,"-Keeps water cold, longer than a regular bottle, but not as long as I would have expected.-Good shape, comfortable to use, and is slightly squeezable.-Freezer safe which is a very good feature-No problems with flavor, my water always tastes like water.-After 3 months of heavy use, have had no leakage problems.Mainly my only concern is that it doesn't keep water as cold as a more traditional thermos. However, it's lightweight, looks good and acts like a good water bottle."
3,"Keeps Liquids Cold, But...","The Polar Bottles really do a good job of keeping drinks cold and they tend to ""sweat"" less than other bottles. They also have fun designs. However, after several months of use, this (and another we have) started to leak. It was leaky to the point that water would run down one's face, whenever one would try to take a drink. Now, we did use the bottles a lot in that time and each one was washed in the dishwasher several times a week. Perhaps if we'd hand-washed them, they would have lasted longer. I also found their internal design (with curves and crannies) made for difficult washing."
5,I love these bottles,"The Polar 24oz size is the shiznit for hot summer bicycle rides. I much prefer these insulated bottles over a bladder pack on my sweaty back. Pack 'em with ice, top off with H2O and you're ready."
5,Polar insulated water bottles,"I have been using these bottles for about a year and they hold up well. They are a great bottle, easy to clean and leaves little to no taste in the liquids. The removable pull up top is a bit stiff but does come out."
5,outdoor drink bottle,does everything advertized. keeps cold drinks nice and cold all the way to the bottom.
4,Good Water Bottle,"This is a really good water bottle. It is insulated but it won't keep your water cold or cool all day. I put in cold water and about an hour later it was slightly cool sitting out in Houston summer heat. The only downside to this bottle is that it is a little hard to squeeze and you kind of have to pump it to get the water out but you're not supposed to guzzle the water anyways so no big deal.As for the other issues that some other reviewers have mentioned such as leaking I suspect that it would leak if you removed the handle/ gasket assembly. The little black tab near the top you see is not just a handle but also a gasket that seals it from leaking. It's important not to take this off and also don't overtighten the lid as it will deform the gasket.On a side note. it worked perfectly with the bottle cage I bought[...]Blackburn Mountain Bicycle Water Bottle CageIt fit that cage like a glove, it literally just snapped right in. I had a really good experience with Amazon here."
4,works,"keeps water cool, not magically cold but it does its job. my old metallic one started to peel the paint outside so i got this"
3,Merely OK at insulation,"I hafta say, I bought two of these and I regret spending the extra money. They've turned out to be expensive water bottles that do just a fair job of staying cold. To use them, I freeze them prior, add ice, cold water, all that jazz, but in the end, I want the coldness to last longer than it does.They work fine as regular water bottles -- no squeezing problems or anything -- and thus they remain on my bike. But I could have had that and more money in my pocket."
5,Great bottle,"PROs : High capacity. Great grip in hand, notch for thumb. Insulated. Good flow rate. Removable nozzle for washing. Made in USA, unlike many competitors.CONs : Makes a crinkle sound when squeezed (not a big deal, but it's something)"
2,Too leaky,"The water bottle has treated me well and leakyness was always an issue but not as big of a problem. Every time I go to take a sip in class, I spill water all over myself and I'm pretty annoyed with it (yes the cap is securely on). Either way I would never recommend this bottle to anyone."
5,Great water bottle,"Purchased this bottle as I was embarking on a trip that involved a lot of hiking (not for biking). It's high capacity, and has a wide mouth so that you can load it with ice cubes. Kept very cold for ~4 hours in 85 degree weather. The valve is removable which makes it a breeze to wash. Very well constructed and made in the USA. Highly recommended."
1,No Good,This is the second same bottle I bought thinking that the first one was defective. I just don't think they work. Will not keep water cold for more than an hour on a 70+ degree day. Worthless product for its stated purpose!
5,Keepin it cool,"I've been using these bottles for a couple of weeks now, and they do a great job of keeping water cold. I carry 2 on the bike, and load them about 1/2 full of ice cubes and then water. 4 hours later the water is still cold, with bits of ice left; granted, it's the season between summers in florida right now, but I have no doubts that I will have cold water to drink in July thanks to Polar."
5,I have 4 now,"I purchased 2x 20 Oz bottles and 2x 24Oz Bottles. I have to say the 24Oz seems a lot more than 4Oz bigger, so I kind of wish I bought all 4 in that size. Either way I am happy with both sizes of bottle and they seem to keep the water pretty cold during 20 mile rides and are easy to drink from."
3,Nipple was a bit hard to pull out!,"I bought this for my road bike. I like the size of it being a 24oz. The only thing that was wrong with it was that the nipple was hard to pull with your teeth. Riding a bike and having to grasp the bottle with one hand to squeeze the water out, you resort to your teeth to pull out the nipple which is hard. Did not like that feature. This is more of a walking bottle and to be used with 2 hands."
5,May be a perfect bottle,"Great bottle. Made in the USA which by itself is quite amazing by today's standards. Quality plastic. No leaks so far, virtually no plastic taste/smell out of the box, easy to open/close the valve while riding. The fit is perfect with a Blackburn Camber CF cage. Insulation helps to keep water cool however it is just marginally better than a plain bottle, but can't really complain about it at this price."
2,Feh...,"It is a well made bottle, but I didn't find it very functional for cycling. It seemed to me that the insulation gave me an extra hour of cold over a comparable water bottle filled with the same amount of ice, but I'm not sure if this would keep fluid cold any longer than a bottle of the same size where the volume from the insulation and the inner layer were simply replaced with ice. The lid screws on and isn't attached to the bottle, so it takes full use of both hands to manipulate if you want to get a big gulp.I suppose there are other times when this bottle might be useful, but if I'm going a little larger in size, our Nalgene liter bottle with an insulating jacket over it is significantly more efficient than this thing. Furthermore, if you want something better than that, Thermos makes some excellent stainless steel water bottles with easy access lids that will keep stuff cold all day with a few cubes of ice."
3,Insulated water bottle is OK but not great,The Polar insulated water bottle is probably neither better or worse than others of the same type. It keeps beverages cooler for a little longer than bottles with no insulation. The problem is that the double wall makes it difficult to squeeze. I have tennis elbow and it hurt to squeeze the bottle so I went back to my regular bottle. The water is warmer but my elbow is happy.I gave away several of the other insulated bottles as prizes for bike race winners and the recipients were happy to get them.
2,Disappointing Insulation,"I bought three of these bottles, based on reviews from people who said there was still ice in their bottles over 10 hours later. After filling the bottles half with ice and half with water, we found the ice was gone after 3 hours. These are good water bottles, I like their large openings and easy-to-open tops. But their insulation is disappointing."
1,bait and switch pricing,"The price listed is not the price of the unit for sale. This false pricing is a bait and switch that gets you to click on the product, but then you can't buy it for the price listed?"
2,"Leaks, doesn't keep water cold","This water bottle doesn't have an o-ring in its cap and thus leaks whenever you tip it into your mouth. Also, the insulation doesn't keep water particularly colder than a regular bike bottle. I gave it 2 stars instead of one for not using BPA, but this thing will leave water dribbling onto your shirt and face every time you use it. Works LESS well than a regular water bottle."
2,Insulated water bottle,"No, this doesn't keep water cold at all. My water stays colder in a regular un-insulated bottle. I ended up purchasing from Green Mountain Coffe, an insulated thermos where you push a button to open lid and it's great."
2,cold water,Polar water bottle does not keep water cold long enough for me. It doesn't work as well as an ordinary old thermos.
3,They are good but not what I was hoping for,"My family is trying to get away from all of the ""waste"" and be a little more ""green"" so I was looking for some nice water bottles. These are O.K. but I was hoping that they would keep things colder much better. They are easy to fill with ice and also to clean."
4,Great Freeze,I really like this bottle. I freeze about half a bottle of water and then right before I leave i add water to it and I take it to work and it lasts halfway through the day. I just wish it held more... :-)
3,Just OK,"I read all the great reviews so was excited to buy these and actually purchased 4!I froze water 1/2 way then put in cold water to top and thought I would be good for the day!! Ahhhh NO!Oh well, I guess I paid $9 for BPA free bottles!"
3,A bit stiff,"Maybe it is the fact that it does not have BPA, the bottle is stiff, making it hard to squeeze it to get the water out. I am back to using my regular bottles."
3,"Not in love with them, but at least they don't contain BPA","Bought 4 of these from Dicks Sporting Goods (cheaper online by about $2/bottle, oh well). They do keep beverages cold, don't think that it is that big of a difference from other bottles though. They also ""sweat"", so the bag I was carrying them in got pretty wet. It says they are dishwasher safe, however I washed all 4 and one of them came out with a slightly melted top rim. The lid still fits on the rim & it and doesn't leak, but it makes me leary. It also says the ""spout"" is removeable for cleaning, but I haven't figured out how to get the spout out ;( The positives of the bottle are they are easy to hold by my oldest all the way down to my youngest (18 mo). It has a sturdy loop on the top for carrying the bottle or hooking onto a bag. Last but not least, since it is tall and lean it fits nicely into car cup-holders."
3,Did not live to it's expectations...,"I expected the bottle to keep liquids relatively cool but it's pretty much foil that's used for the polar insulation, a very cheap solution. I do like the volume of water it holds, the fact you can stick it in the dishwasher and the black loop to carry it around. However, it has no acrylic protective cap over the mouthpiece and I end up drinking with the cap off."
1,Stiff bottle that leaks,"I ordered this bottle and it leaked all over the place. I thought it was defective and exchanged it for another one. The new bottle just leaked less. No matter how hard I screwed the top, water would always get out. The sides are also stiff and hard to squeeze and the water does have a bit of a plastic aftertaste. I do not recommend this bottle."
2,"Annoying in several ways, but does hold water","Functionally this thing is ok. No leaks, no smells, will hold up over time.However, I am a bit nitpicky with stuff I use all the time, and this product is very annoying and I have stopped using it.Drawbacks:- Handle is very wide, always contacts legs on bicycle regardless of position- Valve doesn't have the best flow/play.- Threading on top isn't the smoothest. Easy to cross thread or not tighten 100% resulting in leaks.I will stick with my non-insulated, $3 16oz water bottles. No frills, but everything works better without any headaches. I don't really value the insulation."
2,Not that great,"I bought this bottle with the sole purpose of using it in Bikram Yoga (hot yoga). I read the reviews first and since many said it lasted all day in the heat I figured this would last through 90 minutes of being in a 105 degree room. Well it only lasted about half way through. I had put ice water and ice cubes in it before I left and the water was luke warm by the time class was over. It was only $10, so I will use it for other things, but not yoga. I was trying to avoid dropping $30 on a hydro flask but I guess I'm stuck."
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this thinking that the cap on top was connected to the bottle, like on a Nalgene bottle, but I was disappointed when I discovered that it isn't. That's not a big deal though since you don't have to remove it to drink from the bottle. I already knew from other reviews that the way they put the foil-looking paper with their logo on it inside the clear outer layer didn't really look that good. They were right, it is crumpled and looks pretty cheap. But hey, it was cheap. The nicer looking bottles cost more afterall. The indentation in the middle surprised me in that it makes it very easy to grip and hold the bottle. It also does a good job at preventing sweat on the outside of the bottle. The problem is that it doesn't insulate as much as I had hoped that it would. It is noticeably better than an uninsulated bottle, but insulated stainless steel bottles seem to do the best job at keeping drinks cold."
3,ok water bottle,"I bought this to wean myself off disposable water bottles in the car. It occasionally leaks from the top as I drink and there is a ""plastic"" taste if I don't use and empty the bottle every day."
3,Keeps your drink cold but leaks.,"This bottle fits perfectly in a bike rack and keeps your drink cold for hours, but it leaks. I could figure out why it would leak either. Sometimes it would sometimes it wouldn't. I would always check to make sure the cap was tightly screwed on and it always was, but for some reason it continued to leak. I have a friend who saw that I had the bottle and they asked me if it leaked like theirs did so this bottle isn't just a fluke."
3,You get what you pay for...,"This water bottle is okay...doesn't keep the water cold cold past 3 hrs tops. For the price, you get what you pay for. I would use this for a light run, but not for backpacking for sure!"
3,Its a Water Bottle for Crying out Loud!,"Whats to rate, it keeps the fluid cool longer than a regular bottle... The key is to drink the fluid while exercising instead of afterwards..."
3,Smelly,"I dont know what to say. First time I bought it and once put hot water in, because I didn't know about hot water and plastic, after that it became smelly. Ye, I read on the Internet, it's not only smelly but is harmful for your health because of the chemicals leak. So I through it out and bought the same one (I thought it was my fault to put hot water in). Now it again began smelling. Only once I put it in washdisher, but it says in description that's totally find. So you choose weather to buy it or not. I'm not going to repeat the mistake again)) I dont even know if it's harmful for my health or not to use plastic bottles..."
1,Drips all over your crankset. Ice melts quickly. Poor Design.,"This is a plastic bottle with a plastic bag in between a very narrow air space. When ice is placed on this bottle, not only does it melt fast, but it sweats and drips all over your crankset, chain, etc.Spend a little extra and get the good stainless vacuum bottles. They last a lifetime and don't sweat."
1,Useless for keeping liquids cold,"This bottle looked promising, but looks (and manufacturer's claims) can be deceiving.This bottle is useless for keeping liquids cool in the heat."
2,LEAKING BOTTLE,"PROS:1.Excellent isolation/ temperature preservation.2.Excellent nipple construction.3.Nice ergonomics and looks.CONTRAS:1.It's LEAKING, unless you close it so tight that noone, but a strong 25 y.o. male can open it.2.It's sweating profusely.3.As it's sweating it tends to collect all of the road dust onto itself and you drink from it, remember?VERDICT: Not recommended."
1,Bottle smells funny,Got a silver one on Amazon 3 months ago. I didnt expect it to keep the water cold but the bottle has a distinct smell that never went away... even after 3 months of use.
1,Where is it???????,"I was looking forward to receiving this. While the rest of my order arrived, this did not. Not happy. No explanation for the missing product"
1,Fail,"This product is a disappointment. I wished I had listened to the bad feedback. This bottle provides less insulation than a normal glass. If you want a water bottle that can hold 24 oz... this works. If you want a product that can keep your beverage at the given temperature for more than 10 minutes, this bottle will not make the grade."
2,Not cold,"I was looking for an insulated water bottle. This is somewhat insulated, but I put ice in it with some water, and it didn't stay cold more than a couple hours at the most. If I put in too much ice, then it is a little too slow melting. I like the looks and colors, but it didn't serve the purpose for which I purchased it."
1,LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE!!!,Piece of JUNK - leaks around the screw top - terrible!OK if you're bike riding and you don't mind getting wet - TERRIBLE at work when you spill juice all over your shirt and pants.Save your money!!!
1,Mistake,"I made the mistake of buying this at the sports store. I needed a water bottle for my bike since I was sick of using a stainless steel bottle because it made my water hot in the sun.I bought it for 10 bucks. I was optimistic about it the first few days. The water wasn't super hot, but the bottle was filled with small ice cubes to the top. All melted in a half hour. The smell of the bottle never went away either.After having this bottle for about a month. I've been taking it to my Biology class since all we can have is water. On the way to school, the seal on the lid broke and water leaked all over my supplies. I thought maybe the lid was loose or the thing opened but nope! The seal.I do not recommend buying this bottle at all.On a positive note, the bottle was cute with a blue polar bear on it. And I liked the plastic handle."
2,It's OK,"Like the shape of the bottle and the wide mouth, but it does not keep the water cold much longer than a cheap plain uninsulated bottle. I fill the bottle the night before and leave it in the fridge, then after 3 hours out on my desk, it is room temperature just like my uninsulated bottle used to be. Rather disappointed in that, as having cool water longer was the main purpose in buying this. It is still a nice design and I am using it almost daily."
2,Normal water bottle,I bought this thinking it would keep my water cooler longer thats not the case.I have since gone back to my larger bottle and no longer use this one.I compared two other 24 oz non-insulated bottles and did not notice a difference
2,Leak after washed in the dishwasher,"The water bottle is suppose to be able to be washed in the dishwasher, but after the first wash is began leaking regularly."
1,nipple broken,this item did arrive with a cracked nipple and it leaks when ever you drink from it every time yeah.
1,If I could give it no stars I would,"I just received mine, and I found a long hair imbedded in the plastic, and I ended up having to throw it away"
5,Best Cycling Water Bottle,"If you cycle when it is remotely warm and you enjoy drinking cool water, then these polar insulated bottles are a must have. The day before I go riding I will typically fill the bottle 1/3 with water and freeze it. If I forget to do that, I'll fill it with ice and then add water. Either way, your water will stay much cooler for much longer."
5,Polar water bottle,"Great insulation factor, keeps colder longer than I anticipated. This is a non-toxic plastic and there is no taste factor. The product really delivers what it advertises."
4,Great Insulated Water Bottle,I'm super happy with my purchase of the Polar Insulated Water Bottle (24-ounce).Pros:- Keeps liquids cold for 2+ hours with it's dual-walled construction.- Lid and spout are easy to open/close yet secure.- Fits most bike bottle water holders. Worked on mine fine.Cons:- The pictures of the Polar water bottles look darker than the actual product. The colors in these water bottles are from vinyl inside the dual-wall. That means the colors are much lighter than in the product pictures.
3,Keeps water cold but it leaks.,"The bottle keeps water cold longer than a regular bottle and it doesn't ""sweat"" like regular bottles but it leaks around the lid. I took the black carry loop off to see if that helped stop the leaking, it didn't."
2,Just a plastic water bottle,"There's nothing special about this bottle. It doesn't keep the water cooler longer than any other bottle would. The ""insulation"" is just a gimmick. I returned it and am now looking for a bottle that's either less expensive or one that actually keeps the water cooler."
3,OK..But not impressed,"After reading the reviews, I decided to try it myself. I must have expecting more I guess, the bottle didn't keep my drink cold after an hour of a bike ride. I overnight it in the freezer 3/4 of the drink and in the morning I added cold dring and filled the bottle up. After an hour of ride, the ice was melt and but not as cold as you would expect. It is ok but not to be impressed about."
4,I love these,These insulated bottles are a great idea. In alabama's hot summer when we ride our bikes our water will be hot. These bottles help keep them cooler for our longer rides looking forward to using them for years to come
5,Great design,"This bottle is light, fits in a standard bottle cage perfectly and securely, and is easy to clean. I haven't owned another insulated bottle, but with a bit of ice it does a great job of keeping my beverage nice and cool for an entire day. The White color looks great too.. nice and clean.. and arctic."
2,Ended up throwing mine away,"The idea is wonderful - a self-contained insulated water bottle (living in AZ, insulation is much needed). I didn't ever quite like it, though. I had a hard time drawing water through the mouthpiece. Mine also developed mildew inside after I forgot to empty it. The only way I was able to get rid of the mildew was by soaking it with bleach (not something I want to do if I'm going to drink out of it!). The deal-breaker for me was that water always seemed to taste like plastic. So, after about a year, I ended up throwing it away this afternoon."
2,Well done but very limited coverage,"These tapes cover less than the first month of the first semester of a standard organic chemistry sequence. The coverage is shallow and schematic but accurate. The excellent production ultimately fails to transcend the dullness of the almost unavoidable rote memorization approach to introductory organic chemistry. Of very limited use to students, and no use to those seeking a quick review of the subject."
3,Overall- Pretty Good,It's not too bad when you play the game but you have to admit - the cover's sort of cheesy. It's nice because you can create your own board and choose pictures for it but I made a board and then next time I went on and tried using it but it wouldn't work. The basic idea is worth 5 stars but making it work made me lower by 2 stars. And now whenever I try using it won't work. So Windows ME users - PLEASE DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.
3,OK at this price - not excellent,"This game is OK at this price but it could have been made much better with a little more work. When computer proposes a trade, you can't see the details of the title deed cards involved in the trade - so keep guessing. Graphics is good but not excellent. At this price, it may be OK but I expected a much better work comparing to the other games of these days. Why doesn't somebody make a real good classic Monopoly game with attention to all details for many Monopoly fans out there!!!"
4,Good game except,If your playing the computer by yourself it tends to beat you so as long as you play with others its a good game.
4,"Exciting, couldn't put it down!","Exciting book, not just an ordinary thriller but filled with interesting theories. Couldn't put it down and can't wait to read his next book!"
2,H3 Hallogen bulb,"This light bulb has white color, but on yellow side than the blue side.After using this bulb for a month, one of the bulb went dead. I calledin Amazon and got replacement bulb. Second bulb died another monthlater, so I changed bulb to LED."
4,Good Product,Good lights. Easy installation. Work just as described. Longevity seems to be normal. They are brighter than factory and slightly blue but not too blue as to be terribly annoying. Would by again.
3,Expected More,"Valerie Boyd is a great singer and I love her voice. I expected more from this CD because her other CD's were phenonemal. However, I don't know what it was but something seemed to be missing. It's a good CD, but I enjoyed some of her previous ones a little more."
5,Oh Yes I Can!,"I just want to encourage anyone who is even thinking about purchasing this CD. Wanna talk about inspirational music? This CD has been on repeat since the day I received it. I got ""Victory"" because he ""Fixed Me"" and His ""Grace"" ""Got me out Again"" ""Yes I Can"" do all things through Christ. Great CD!!"
4,"Good strategies, but where's the democracy?","Good advice especially re: dealing with the press, lawyers, and applying strategy. Would have liked to see a lot more about getting social change organizations to really involve their members in running the organization- its still ""Tales of the Super Organizer"" a model activists need to outgrow and are already outgrowing."
4,Mom loves this necklace,"she definitely loves it. the yellow gold compliments well too. the only downside at all with this necklace is that the chain is a touch on the thin side, but still, wonderful, and worth every penny."
2,way to small,"looks and sounds bigger in the description, but this thing is so small its almost unbeklievable......."
2,disappointed,"Firstly, the item came after mother's day. It was too late to cancel because the item had already been shipped. For the $99 paid plus shipping and handling, I felt I overpaid since Kohl's had the exact same thing for $39.99. My grandchildren bought it for their mother and so I felt they were overcharged for the item. I only ordered for them because they were unable to do so themselves. It was their choice. I was extremely disappointed in the handling of the item since they could not give their mother her present on Mother's Day."
4,Healthy Living!,"Santa brought this set for Christmas along with a bunch of other play food sets. I was very happy that foods in this set were healthy, however they are not as realistic as I was hoping for. The price was a bit high for the amount of pieces in the set. The baskets are very nice for storage and to play grocery store."
5,Lots of benefits...,"My daughter has lots of play food, but this is by far the best. It gets her accustomed to associating fruits & vegetables with meals & snacks and making healthy food & drink choices more of a norm. The spaghetti is her favorite, since the sauce with meatballs is seperate from the pile of spaghetti, so she can ""fix"" it herself. She also even has fun with the basket it all comes in when she plays grocery store (selecting fruits and vegetables, of course). Kids loose interest in their toys so quickly, but this is one she consistently plays with over and over again. I also highly recommend the breakfast and lunch sets, too. The quality in these toys far exceeds that of her other play food, making it really stand out from the rest. Two big thumbs up!"
5,Great food for pretend play!,"This play food is very lifelike. My three year old girl and 5 year old boy have great fun fixing ""dinner"" for me. The texture is so much better than the old plastic type, and stays on the plate."
4,"Insightful look at ""forgotten"" LA from 1944-1948","Bethell and Roxborough compile a sincerely insightful attempt at reexamining the ramifications of social, political, and economic change which were mirrored in Latin America in the period following the Second World War and preceding the Cold War. Perhaps most tragic is the subtle implication of U.S. foreign policy in the loss of a unique opporunity for democratic revival which arose in LA after WWII. Wonderful read, if this is an area you're interested in."
3,HOPE SPRINGS???,"HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS SET FOR THE PAST WEEK. THOUGH THE STORYLINE IS AMUSING, IT HAS PARTS THAT DRAG. I FIND MYSELF WANTING TO FAST FORWARD JUST TO FIND THE ENDING OF AN EPISODE. THE CHARACTER SHOO IS VERY ANNOYING. ELLIE AND THE OTHERS ARE OKAY. AS OF TODAY I HAVE 2 MORE EPISODES TO WATCH. I JUST MAYBE SENDING THIS BACK FOR A TRADE IN."
3,One very unsympathetic character!,"My wife and I tried to like this. Really. With Alex Kingston and Annette Crosbie and a good supporting cast, it should have worked. But halfway through the third episode, we just couldn't take the character Shoo for one more minute. Even the bad guys were more likable than Shoo. Needy, selfish and stupid - no redeeming characteristics at all. Good acting cannot save bad writing and THAT character was badly written and annoyingly portrayed. Oh, and the scenery was gorgeous."
5,Fellini in Veracruz,"These short stories of a poor orphan girl growing up in a small town in Veracruz will make you both laugh and cry, sometimes simultaneously. That the author emerges as a stronger and wiser person at the end is proof of her Fellinesque love of life....a very good read."
3,If You Were Ever a Child,"A Mexican woman looks back on the world of hardships she knew as an orphan and finds compassion for the girl she once was. Seen through the eyes of a child and told with the wisdom and humor of an adult, these brief stories are inspiring and, at times, hilarious. No matter how harsh the circumstances, kids will be kids. If you were ever a child, read this book."
4,Great pretty pouch to use,"It is a pretty bright color than the picture, especially under the sun, good fabric, looked durable. I love it. =)"
4,great for small camera,I purchased this for my college aged son. He needed something to protect his camera. The price was great and it is very handy. I took it down 1 star because I am not in love with the color. I wish there was black available. The red is sort of dull.
4,it's a nice little case,"it's ok. i wanted a case to go with my new canon after i skimped on a case with my previous camera and cracked the screen in my pocket. i don't know if this case would stop that happening again - but it does make the whole thing too bulky to put in my jeans, so i guess that's a kind of protection...."
4,Not bad,"I bought this case for my Canon PowerShot SD1200IS 10 MP Digital Camera. It fits very well.But if you want to put battery, cable etc. in it with digital camera, I recommend you Case Logic UP-2 Universal Pockets Medium instead of this case."
4,Case Logic UNZ-2,This case is perfect for my Canon SD1000IS except I wish it had a small slot to store extra battery and/or memory.
4,Perfect for Canon SD 770IS,"This is perfect fit for my Canon SD 770IS. A good value for money.Unlike those Canon's hard leather cases which are not easy to fit in pockets, this one easily fits."
5,Great Case for inside a case,I ordered this case for my canon sd1100 and like it very much. But I found although it's a great case for protecting the camera itself it doesn't give you room for anything else.
2,Lousy,"A ""case"" should offer some degree of protection. This case, which is made out of flimsy, wind-breakerish material, offers virtually none. The sewn in ""screen protector"" section has a little bit more, but even this level of padding would be unacceptable if it were to cover the whole thing. Your camera would fare virtually no better if dropped while in this case than if not.If you want a cute, but completely worthless case, buy this one. Something weighing no more and being no larger could provide a HUGE degree more protection than this. Wrap your camera in a T-shirt: boom, 3 or 4 times the protection.Would be a fair sale at 1.99, and not a dollar more."
5,Excellent,"This simple camera case is perfect for my Canon SD1200. Sure the case doesn't fit a spare battery, but the slim case fits perfectly in my pocket and the green color stands out well when buried in my gear bag. An added bonus is the neoprene(?) material of the case and the sewn seams create an extra ""bumper"" on the edges of the camera to absorb gravitational abuse! Though, I haven't tested this yet..."
4,"Good, comfortable case, but the zipper in wrong direction","The case fits the Canon 770 very snuggly, so it protects it well without camera moving in case. However, the camera strap is on the camera's side, which prevents you to insert the camera in upright position. In order for you to have the screen go against the padded screen protector side, the camera has to be inserted upside down, not as intuitive.2nd suggestion for Case logic. Many of us like wrapping our cameras around our shoulders, camera by our side, than danging from our wrist. I will likely have to buy another case, because I like having camera on my side, hands-free and have it diagonally across my shoulder. They should offer the longer strap; much more useful to have hands-free than to occupy one hand."
4,Tie rod end,Just what I need to fix my truck. Very fast delivery. Part is a lot cheaper than at the parts store. Two thumbs up.
4,Great story in a great setting,Island Murders can take you to the Carolina beaches and flowing intracoastal waterway in a heartbeat. Ms. Canada brings us a strong Southern girl as the main character and envelopes her in more trouble than a soul deserves. An overall great read.
4,FUN READ,"Wanda Canada made her characters come alive. They interacted so believably, I thought I knew them. It was a fun read. I knew who the bad guy was, but there were still lots of twists and turns."
3,Decent starter book,"We're currently planning our retirement homestead so this seemed like a good book. It's a good starter. but lacks the detail in most places to really act on. I highly recommend this book for those considering setting up a homestead, but you'll need more details for most of the sections. As an aside, the slaughter of rabbits section is awesome. Read it before you decide whether or not you want to raise your own meat."
2,Painful.,"After having taught Cisco classes out of the old book, I had high expectations for the updated one. Big mistake. The Odom books are scattershot, disorganized, and annoying. There are factual errors (RJ stands for Registered Jack, not Regulated Jack as claimed on p290). His Fred and Barney examples aren't cute, and his lecture-mode writing style gets old fast. Especially annoying is the introduction of topics with a question and then answering it with ""Well, blah blah.""""Why would I buy this book? Well, if you want Cisco Press, you're kinda stuck with Odom."""
4,Everything you need - Well almost.,"This is a great book if you are taking the 2 test approach towards your CCNA. Everything on the exam is in this book. I would have given 5 stars however, a beginner in subnetting would be at a loss due to relatively poor coverage of the fundamentals in this book. I had some experience before studying this volume and Mr. Odom managed to confuse me. If you use this book for the INTRO exam, I highly recommend finding an alternate source for subnetting(there are many good free tutorials; try Boson.com."
1,I give this book a D+,I read the book cover to cover. Usally the book titled for the exam covers what is on the exam but this book does a poor job. Most of the Intro test is Subneting and Cisco commands while the book spends 3 out of 16 chapters on what is really important for the exam. One chapter for Subnetting I cant believe that. Its needs many more examples also for subneting the CD isn't enough. Don't even bother with the two chapters on commands just get your self a lab or Bosons. I just wish I had not wasted my time reading cover to cover. I wish I just got S..bex or some other book sooner I also used a video series. Pasted my exam its not that bad if you are studying the right stuff.
4,Solid Cisco Skills,This book is great. It is an excellent solid test prep guide.A must for professionals wanting to learn about Cisco and Networking. I passed the exam with 905.
1,Very dissapointing,"The information in this book is extremely juvenile (kind of like Mr. Smith goes to Washington). It is more a fictional novel than a ""how to"" book that I was looking for. Most of the book is filled with unneeded and boring details about a fictional character (what she likes to eat, what cloths she wears, where she went to college, her friends, ugh!). There's almost no information in here explaining how government actually works and how to run for office. It was just a big waste of time."
1,A Catastrophe! One of the worst historical transfers ever!,"These old recordings did not sound as bad on my 78 sets, and are heard better on Lys 271-273, where they are transferred in genuine mono. On this Pearl transfer by Lennick, the bass is grotesquely boomy, there are poor highs, and gobs of fake stereophonic echo, making the sound rumbly, indistinct, and ugly. The performances are very fine, better in some cases than the stereo versions mostly conducted by Stravinsky (with a lot of help from Robert Craft.) However, few collectors who are conscious of good technique in transferring old records would approve of *this* edition."
2,There's something you should know before buying this.,"This music was recorded between 1940 and 1946. It says so on the cover, but it's illegible in the tiny little picture Amazon gives you. The recordings are monaural and very noisy. They sound very much like they were recorded in 1940. So while the CD has historical and educational value, it's not much of a pleasure to listen to. The CBS Masterworks ""Stravinsky Conducts Stravinsky"" series is a much better deal."
3,Other review is not for this City Opera recording,"I participated in the stage production and subsequent recording of this version on the Nonesuch label, so I can state authoritatively that it is not in German and, therefore, not the recording reviewed by Brett Farrell elsewhere on this page. I don't think it's fair for me to review it, so I'm giving it an average rating because I have to enter something."
4,Great tool for teaching letters,"We use these bean bags to teach our kids about letters. There are lots of little games you can make up to teach kids about sounds, letter, and words."
3,Mostly great!,"A great product, we have used them to play lots of games to consolidate the boys letter and sound learning. Only negative is they were a little smaller than i had expected...."
1,Very small and disappointing,The measurements are very misleading. The bean bags themselves are just 2-1/2 inches square. The measurement listed under 'product description' is for the BAG that they come in. We will be sending them back.
3,El Enredo for Spanish students,"It's a good, fun mystery story, but it should have an English translation. It is good for 4th or 5th year Spanish students, however, it would be much better if it had an English translation so students could understand better after reading it in Spanish."
1,INEFFECTIVE PRODUCT - WASTE OF MONEY - NOTHING IS PERMANENT!,I purchased Kalo direct and used Kalo correctly and faithfully for two years. They said it 'takes time.' I saw absolutely no improvement. I do not recommend this product.
5,Extreme Doom/Death Unlike Any Other (TRUE doom),"This is the most extreme doom/death album in existence in the scene today, and TRUE doom... not sludge/noise/drone garbage.Unique and macabre harmonies overlay cataclysmically heavy rythyms, yet with enough off-time variation within the songs to keep things interesting. Pay attention, and you'll hear the variations in timings etc., and absorb the incredible atmospheres and monolithic heaviness.A solid wall of massive dark, brutal doom, with the lowest vocals of anyone else out there, and no keys.Wan't TRUE extreme doom/death? This is it!"
5,Truly Lovecraftian Metal,"Doom must be the metal genre with the largest number of groups driving inspiration from and quoting Lovecraft's writings in their lyrics. That said, after 10 years or so of serious doom listening this is the first time that I hear a band (or one man project, to be exact) capture a real Lovecraftian atmosphere in its music... this is the perfect soundtrack for reading The Call of Cthulhu on a dark, stormy night while drinking some brandy by the fireplace. Musically, this project sounds something like a very atmospheric Skepticism, mixed with Esoteric's slower riffs and some Sunn O))) droning. So, unless you're seriously into doom's slower flavours (extreme, drone and funeral), you'll be better off passing on this one since most metal listeners will write off this album as nothing but slow, boring, atonal and repetitive noise."
4,Cthulhu Metal,"I don't know jack about doom metal. I'm here as a Lovecraft buff, and In the Depths of R'lyeh is exactly the kind of music I'd expect to hear if I visited a certain ill-omened island in the far south Pacific. Ominous, disturbing, and brooding.Now we need a Catacombs CD from Yuggoth!"
1,Horribly Repetitive,I didn't think it was possible to actually have a record put out a cd where for 72 minutes you listen to the same song over and over again. The only redeeming quality of this cd is the heaviness felt on your chest as you listen to its repetitively agonizing songs
4,I love this book ...,Oh uhhhh! Rodzina is on the orphan train .. on her way to ... ???!Yikes!Will Rodzina find a home of her own?Or will she end up being a slave the rest of her life?Will she ever be happy?Read it!Fantastic!
3,All right,I enjoyed this book. It wasn't anything special like some of the author's other books. But I still enjoyed it on audiobook.
3,"Good, if you want to design a SPICE simulator","Eh, it's a decent-enough book. The author is obviously well-versed. But, there's a lot of background theorems and proofs that make this feel more like a math-text than a ""tweak this to get this"" solution for SPICE modeling. I thought Chap7 (noise) plus Appendix-A and Appendix-B were solid, the rest would be useful if you plan to design your own SPICE-sim, not use something already out there."
3,Confessions of a Golf Nut,"Many of us look forever for the ""perfect golf book"" the ""critical golf lesson"" and never find it. One message rings true in Hibbards work; don't get too technical - then he gets too technical. My advice, the advice of a confessed golf nut, practice your short game, see a PGA pro, and quit trying to find success in all the wrong places. If you add George's book to your library, realize it for what it is, one more resource, to be taken lightly. Example: Met with a PGA pro today (I am about a 9-11) and he said two things in 45 minutes. They made sense, are easy to practice, and helped. This is not the Critical Details philosophy. Trust me."
1,A Really Bad Book,"The whole things looks like it was written, edited and produced by a 4th grader. The B&W images are too small, the writing style is wordy and most of his tips are too confusing. It is possible, somewhere in this mess, that there is a sound swing theory, but I sure can't find it. Worst golf book I have ever purchased, without a doubt!!"
1,Where are the details?????,"Poorly organized, verbose writing style and most of all lacking in basic communications skills. I'm not sure how an editor let this thing get published. It contained virtually nothing I found useful and ranks as the worst golf instruction book I've ever read."
5,worthwhile read,"This book is a worthwhile read for the serious student of the game. It answers many of the questions which plague us by addressing root causes of various types of bad shots. Both ball curvature and ball contact issues are addressed.Hibbard draws on material from Mike Austin and from Gravity Golf in identifying ""golf's critical details"". The real basis of his theories is rooted in TGM. There is much here I've never seen presented before."
5,"Great product, poor description.",These vent visors are great. They are the type that go over the door frame and notthe in-channel ones that mess up your window tint. Vent visor discontinued making them for the prelude so these are a great find.
2,More theory than applications,"Compared to the recently republished papers of Mandelbrot, i had hoped much more from this book. It merely summarizes the existing work on multifractals without providing much insight about why is multifractal theory interesting in practice. If you are interested in a very good mathematical treatment go to the homepage of Rudolf Riedi at Rice University and read his papers. For the original ideas about multifractals and a far more applied perspective go to Mandelbrot's books and also ""Critical phenomena in natural sciences"" by Sornette, you'll get a more balanced theory-practice mix than in the present book. The only merit of this book is to reference quite fairly the existing literature, but this should not be the sole aim of a book, so i think that with this one you'll waste your time."
2,disappointment,"I've heard the song ""Candles"" on the radio and I thought it was nice. So when I went to Best Buy and saw the low price I decided to pick up this CD. Well.....all I can say is how disappointing. All the songs are very bland and without direction. The only bright spot is the song ""Hazy Shades"" This song is very good and powerful. I wish she would have built off what she did in that one song. Instead she loses purpose and the CD goes down the drain."
2,Tried to enjoy it....,"I wanted to enjoy this album more than anything. I listened to this repeatedly, hoping that my ears had decieved me. But, with each listen, I grew more and more disappointed. The main flaw of this album is it's lack of direction. I am confused as which style she is using. The songs cannot be distinguished from one to the next. It is not like she has a bad voice or anything. Her vocals have potential. There is just no clear hit or song that I can honestly say that I enjoyed or would want to listen to over and over again. I hope Pru has better luck and a sense of direction next time around."
1,THE TRUTH FORGET THE SALES,THIS ALBUM IS OKAY FOR THOSES OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T HEARD ANY GOOD QUALITY MUSIC IN THE LAST 5+ YEARS. THIS IS A DEBUT ALBUM THAT EVEN THE NEIGHBORS NEXT DOOR COULD HAVE WHIPPED UP. IF YOU WANT SO SMOOTH SOULFUL MUSIC CHECKOUT SPARKLE'S NEW CD. IT'LL SURE TO PLEASE YOU WALLETS AND EASE YOUR MIND.
2,couldn't feel it,"I was not impressed with this CD, like one of the reviewers here already said: ""Hazy Shades"" is the only bright spot. Pru being compared with Lauryn Hill is a little bit far fetched, her style reminds me of Des'ree."
2,The Band Wagon Is Not Heading In Her Direction !!,"Please.......OK!! Some artist need to be serious about what they put out on the market. This was screwed up starting with the scary CD cover. There's nothing original about the CD, her or the style she was trying to represent. Jill, Badu, N'Dambi, Amel and others all have one thing in common, thier ability to sing from the SOUL and not claim any industry labels such as ""new soul"", ""neo-soul"" genres. Pru tryed to grab onto a style that never was. This new sound that's going around really doesn't have a genre or name to catagorize its sound and Pru fail to see that. Being original is really the only new style that Badu and others have mastered. The only song that's worth any attention may be the remake of ""smooth operator"" and I'm only feeling it because of the tigh beat. I said I would never right a bad review but this one needed my attention after wasting my money.oNe"
4,Excellent CD. Well worth the price.,"I am always excited to find new music that is from talented individuals. I enjoyed this album and especially loved ""Hazy Shades."" The album is unique in that the songs display not only talent but also creativity and passion. The music is also not commerical R&B but is heart-felt and substantive. A good buy for individuals who enjoy Neo-soul or are looking for something outside of the top 40."
2,very poetic...but alas...i yawn....,"Pru's ability as a poet is not at question here; she is a gifted writer...but...her style just doesn't cross over musically. i enjoy a variety of sounds and styles, this just ain't one of them...but then again, maybe i'm just one of them ""simple"" people that another reviewer refered to. Meshell Ndegeocello and Cassandra Wilson offer ""deeper"" experiences for me; Syleena Johnson provides that gut-bucket funk, but if you like Pru may i suggest Alana Davis or Adriana Evans...their albums are very excellent."
2,Not at all hot,"If you are looking for an untapped gem of an album- this isn't it. The best track on the album is the cover of the Sade classic ""Smooth Operator"". This IS NOT a ""neosoul"" album, please believe me on this one. It is better than most R&B albums of the mainstream set, but it doesn't compare to Jill, Badu, N'dambi, Kindred, Jazzyfatnastees, et al. You want a good album that you may never have heard of? Buy Res' debut, that will aim and deliver. Or get the Jazzyfatnastees- that's really tight. Anyone on here that says PRU delivers must not have a decent collection of music or a decent level of musical taste, either. Holla> falxwon"
1,Okay????!!!!???,This could've been a tighter CD but there is just something missing. She got the voice but something just wasn't clicking. She seemed kinda lazy in her approach for a first album. The tracks were fine...I just don't know what it is??
3,This is Good!,"This is a welcome addition to my ""Neo-Soul"" collection. Looking forward to her next release."
4,Good 1st Album,"I recently heard Pru sing ""Candles"" live on the radio and was very impressed with her vocal skills.... Although Candles, Aaroma, And Hazy Shades are the songs I listen to most often off the CD I like the the smoothness and mellow sounds that she brings. Although others have stated that she needs to grow more as an artist I think she will be very successful and I look forward to her future works."
3,imaginative cd,"i bought this cd on a recommendation of a dj friend.......like many on this board at first i wasn't feeling the cd....but now her ""lauryn hill"" like vocals, deep and raspy and her poetry have grown on me....i think the production was fine...very imaginative reminded me a little of kelis production...for many ppl it might be a little too rock influenced..she uses alot of acoustic guitars in her songs..her music is not cookie cutter soul.....i love...candles...sketches of pain...183...keep doing your thing pru"
3,NOT SCOTCH BRAND TAPE AS DESCRIBED!,"ITEM SHOWN & DESCRIBED IN LISTING: Scotch 8959 EXTREME Bi-Directional Filament Tape, Transparent 50mm Wide x 50M Long. ITEM RECEIVED HAS NO PACKAGING LABEL, NOR DOES INSIDE CARDBOARD IN WHICH TAPE IS WOUND ON HAVE ANY LABEL. DIMENSIONS / BI-DIRECTIONAL FILAMENT TAPE SEEM ACCURATE.

I PURCHASED SCOTCH - RECEIVED ??? BUYER BEWARE - THIS LISTING IS FALSE ADVERTISING!"
2,didn't realize it was an abridged version,"When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was abridged. If you want the full text, in the authors own language, don't buy this book."
4,treasure island by robert louis stevens,"Treasure island is a good book i advise you read it. The main charater is a man named Jim, and one day he meets a pirate named Billy Bones.After Billy Bones died Jim got the map (and a blind begger named Pew tired to get Jim,his mom,and the map (he dies)) and him and a man named Long John Sliver (the one with 1 leg) and he gets a crew and another captain named Captain Smollett which doesn't like the crew but is are ready to set sail to the island that had the treasure. They never say were this island is which keeps you wondering but the get closer and closer each day to the treasuer, but its a good book and the end is suprising but i hope you like it ."
2,"Loved the stroller at first, now has issues","When we first bought this stroller, it was great. Easy to fold, lightweight. It is a little hard to get through doorways and you can't get it through most stores at the mall, but we still liked it. About 3 months after we purchased it the handle that lifts up for your child to get in, broke. So now it does not open. It has been a year and now the wheels wobble and it is hard to push. It can not make it over cracks in the side walk. I really think this is cheaply made. The baskets are worthless. They are sooooo small and hard to get to. I would do a lot of research before I purchased this stroller."
2,Out & About,"I agree with the Amherst mom. I really liked this stroller at first. If fit in my small trunk beautifully and I appreciated how light it is. However, seven months into my use of it, it is already falling apart. The restraints are laughable. My 2 1/2 year old pops out of them easily and so does my 6 month old who I've just started to put in it without the car seat. Plus, the plastic tubing in one of the canopies has broken through the material and is coming out and the wheels have begun to pit and crack. I use this stroller all the time and I do not expect it to last a year. I'm really disappointed."
5,Quality Product,I own two other All-Clad products and have yet to be disappointed. The construction is sound and consistency in cooking is great. I'll definitely be adding more to the kitchen cupboards in time.
5,Outstanding quality,This product is an outstanding piece of workmanship. This is my first All-Clad purchase and I could not be more pleased. I now understand why I see this product used by so many chefs on TV. Everything about it is perfect.
2,Small saucepan,"I though I was going to be thrilled with this pan since it is made in the USA except for the lid. However, the lip is not rolled so when you go to pour liquids out of the pan it goes everywhere. I had to return it."
2,Handle is just too small,"Excellent quality, but the handle hurts your hand when filled with water & heavy. Perhaps if I had small hands it might be ok? I dunno. I sent it back and purchased the Calphalon and was very happy."
3,Awkwardly shaped,"I purchased this straight-sided pot for making small batches of candies. Because the diameter of this pot is so small, it is tricky to use over gas burners on a regular residential type range. However, it works perfectly on an induction burner (if you have one). What I don't understand about this pot is that, unlike other All-Clad pots/pants, the handle is angled more sharply upwards instead of being level with the top of the pot (or at a 90-degree angle from the side). This design, coupled with the small footprint of the pot, makes it more prone to tip over when bumped, resulting in the pot being something of a hazard to use in a busy kitchen. Anyone have any clue why this particular pot has a different handle? I'm curious."
2,Hot to Dine,"4th degree burns can be suffered when handling this metallic brim stoke pot, which doesn't have cool iron density retraction at the handle. You are better getting a cool wave disperse model which Maytag sells, but if you use a Calco hand glove, this is just as good."
1,Don't know,This is a book that was purchased for my daughter's college class. I can't say anything about it and that's why I gave it one star.
3,"look ok, installation not the best.","They're thinish plastic that attach with double-stick tape... so when you have to replace your head or tail bulbs, you'll have to get some more double-stick to put them back on. The pieces for the front parking lights didn't fit at all with the tape. I ended up pulling the light unit, drilling a couple of holes, and attaching those with a couple of small screws. I'd like to do the same with the head and tail light covers too, but the tape does seem fairly solid, and I decided to be done with the project for now. That said, they do look pretty good on the jeep, though the black headlight guards do clash a bit with the chrome rings... I may get some black coated rings."
3,"Outstanding designs, but lacks of essential information","I found the designs and patterns in Ms. Kidd's book very accurate and easy to execute. Some of the designs, particularly those from the the Middle Ages were beautifully made and outstanding. Nevertheless, the summaries describing the periods were extremely brief. I also hoped to find essential information about the materials that were used in the original designs centuries ago, but I guess I'll have to keep on looking elsewhere. If you are a beginner, if you need ideas and already have fair knowledge of sewing techniques, this book is definitely for you."
3,Not bad,"I have had this book for about 5 years - the length of time I have been sewing historic garb. It has some useful info, and nice illustrations. It is rather clear cut as well, but if you are looking for specifics and acurate costumes this wouldnt be the best choice. Sort of a quick and dirty guide. All in all, useful info for all kinds of costuming, but one can find a much more comprehensive, period specific book for a bit more money. Works well as a companion book."
4,Great Resource for High School Theater!,"Costumes frequently loom large in the production of high school theater: where shall we get them? We can't afford to rent! How the heck do I make period costumes?This lovely book helps fill the gap and, when used in conjunction with Holkeboer's ""Patterns for Theatrical Costumes,"" eases the problem of costume patterns and construction to a great degree. Highly recommended!"
2,It Promises Much....,"But offers little. There are some excellent ideas in this book, but there doesn't seem to be much pay-off. I guess I prefer a more step-by-step approach, in that when someone offers up an idea for making a tiara out of net and wire, I expect some diagrams and instructions. I understand the need for fast and dirty costuming - I don't have to like it! - but every costumer generally finds his or her own ways, and there don't seem to be any new ways in this book that I, or others that I have learned from or spoken with, haven't already passed on (or found in other books, picked up on the streets, heard of in dank bars, and so on and so forth....heh....).Which is to say, a true compendium of all the tricks of the trade would be as thick and as heavy as the Unabridged Knowledge Of All Things Useful."
3,Squeaky band?,"I received the watch very quickly, love the watch however couple concerns were that the watch came with a few small knicks on the band. Not a big deal as I know this can happen anytime. However the more concerning issue is that one side of the band connected to the face makes quite an annoying squeak... Has anyone else expeirence that with this or another watch? Is that normal? Is there a way to fix it? Thanks!"
4,Classy Design,"I have had this watch for two years now, and it has easily withstood the abuse that I've thrown at it with only a few minor scratches. The crystal is very scratch resistant. The UTC hand is especially useful as a pilot, but the slide rule is so small that you might as well stick to your handheld E6-B when in a vibrating airplane. However, it is legible enough the rest of the time. My watch looks just as classy as the day I bought it."
5,Thanks from Germany,Thanks for the very fast shipment to Germany. Very good Watch with all certificates and papers. Will get my next watch to from you!!Kind regards from Germany
4,Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Nighthawk Watch,Excellent Watch (Eco-Drive) I would spend the extra hundred and purchase the titanium.
3,Overall a good watch,"Overall a good quality watch. Too big and heavy for my taste. The numbers around the dial, associated with flight computer, are hard to see. The GMT hand gets mingled below the primary hands and become hard to view."
5,Good All-Purpose Watch,"Ok, so i'm not one of those watch enthusiasts or anything... But I can tell you that I did A LOT of research before purchasing this watch 6 months ago and it has met or exceeded all of my expectations. I like the weight of the watch, not too heavy but you know its there, weight is sign of reliability in my mind.. I have yet to use the circular slide rule in a real-life situation but i like knowing that I can take the square root of a number or convert units anytime i want..If you're looking for a good looking watch with simple, attractive design and a little functionality this is the watch for you.And as a clumsy person I can tell you that this watch is rugged, i've dropped it a few times and walked into things while wearing it and still has no scratches to the face"
4,An Impressive Piece,"As a collector of watches I rate the Nighthawk as an impressive one that I am pleased to own and can wear in any situation.Intricate enough to be impressive, but simple enough to be practical, if you like watches you'll like this one."
3,Very nice piece,I will admit the movement and the technology is very very cool. I love the way this watch looks and I would give it 5 stars if it was not that easy to scratch. Maybe.. just maybe I had some bad luck but I own many many other pieces that have scratched cases etc etc and I always keep the face flawless but this one just has one(1) line going across the face.. When I first saw it I actually thought it was a cat hair and when I could not wipe it away I was blown away... Ive had bigger faced watched from Swiss Legends that I have demolished but the face magically stood the test ... this one did not for some reason.. other than that small detail the watch is great!
5,Awesome watch!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Forget the Omega's, Rolex's or other over priced ""Buying the Name Watches"". This is one awesome watch."
3,Citizen Nughthawk,"Very elegant watch, has at least four defects. A little too heavy, lacks of an alarm and it would be better if was radiocrontrolled. The calculator is too little to view."
4,Mighty Fine Watch,"This is simply one of the most beautiful watches I have owned. The attention to detail and finish are top-notch. I have many higher dollar watches, and aesthetically, this tops most of them.I agree, a stopwatch would be a nice addition. I don't know where you would put it.It is massive, but I am too, so I wanted it to be. Some reviewers called it ""heavy"" but I don't find it particularly so.I'm not giving it five stars because the band feels cheap. It isn't going to break, that's clear. It isn't going to fall off either, with the clasp lock.Regardless, this watch is an immediate favorite of mine. Thanks for offering it at such a great price, Amazon!"
3,"Not a bad watch to have, but......","I have this watch for almost 4 years, and it worked well so far, no complaints for that matter. The only problem is, that if you wear it for an extended period of time, or you keep in on, the whole time, this watch has a big winding crown, that sticks out and makes it unconfortable in the back of your hand. It left me a dark mark (calluses) right where the winding crown touches the back of your hand."
4,Which Political Party Is Better For Black Americans,Looking back not too many years the Democratic Party was very anti-black. This book spells out all of the facts. How did the Democratic Party garner over 95% of the black vote given its dismal record of serving our black citizens and other citizens as well? Can the Republican Party do better for our underserved citizens? Perhaps both parties are morally corrupt. Do we really need a third political party in America to serve the majority of our citizens who are being ignored by both political parties?
1,Another right-wing screed,"This book is one of the most ahistorical reads around. Full of 'facts', but extremely ideologically biased when it comes to analysis. Democrats, Republicans, Whigs - even most abolitionists - were ALL racists. And yes, this extended into the 20th century.But the Republican and Democratic parties that exist today are not the same as those of the 19th or even middle 20th century. The racist white segregationist Southern Democrats and Dixiecrats abandoned the Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s and ended up in the Republican Party.If you want to reinforce your infantile right-wing views on race and politics in this country, this book is for you.However, if you're interested in an objective discussion of the issue, there are plenty of other REAL historians to read. Check out Eric Foner's ""Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution 1866-1877"" and Manning Marable's ""Race, Reform, and Rebellion: The Second Reconstruction and Beyond in Black America, 1945-2006""."
2,"Good book, if only...","I felt it was a well written book, with an interesting plot, but I was turned off by the details into the characters sex life."
2,Disappointing effort from Bill Charlap,"I've heard cuts from Bill Charlap's trio albums on FM and bought ""All Through the Night"" which I really like and so I purchased ""Written in the Stars"". This has been a disappointment--Charlap doesn't seem as inventive as his earlier effort and a couple of the tempos are way slow (The Man that Got Away and One for my Baby)."
1,The album is supposed to feature the pianist not the rhythm section!,I would not buy this album because the bass fiddle is TOO LOUD and over-rides the pianist.
5,A fine trio performance,"I just finished listening to an interview of Bill Charlap on NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday. I've had this gorgeous CD for at least a year and play it often. I also had the pleasure of hearing Charlap play live with the Phil Woods Quintet last year. On this CD, Charlap and his trio mates, Kenny Washington (d) and Peter Washington (b), offer a wonderful selection of 11 standards (Blue Skies and Where or When in waltz time are two of my favorites) that reinterpret these tunes in a consistently lyrical and appealing way. You might be tempted to pop this CD in the player as background music, but I recommend that you listen to it carefully and attentively, because I guarantee that your appreciation of the sensitive and intelligent interaction of these outstanding players will be even greater as a result. Bill Charlap probably isn't a household name, even among many jazz fans, but if he continues to turn out fine performances like this one I hope he will be."
5,Great!,"I sell a lot of stuff on ebay & this tape is great! It's not super high quality, but gets the job done and is a lot better than some similar priced mailing tape."
5,good strong tape,"I was happy to find a set of six rolls of tape. They had a reasonable price and its a good, strong tape to seal boxes and mailing packages."
4,Not bad but not the best Scotch brand packing tape,"I bought this by mistake when I ran out of 3850 packing tape; I just wasn't paying attention. This is certainly better than a lot of cheap packing tapes, but I was disappointed in the drop in quality from the 3850. This is thinner and not as clear.Of course, it's half the price of the 3850, and the difference in quality may not justify the increased cost for many, but it does for me."
2,Terrible quality. Really flimsy.,"Despite having the Scotch brand, this tape is very low quality and thin. I would only trust it on very, very lightweight shipments. Unfortunately, most things that go in a box are not that lightweight, so it's really pretty pointless. I read a couple of other reviews saying the same thing, but I thought I'd take my chances since some people thought it was great. I wonder now if those people have ever used other packing tape! Spend your money wisely on the slightly pricier, heavy duty tape. You'll be saving money in the long run!"
4,Good value but bit flimsy.,"Great value for the length and the price. It just feels bit flimsy and quite thin, compared to some other tape I used, so that I have to put several layers on top to feel the package safe enough."
5,It was simply an amazing eye-opener!,Ms. Scott has truly hit close to home on a subject that a lot of women do not want to talk about or even deal with - the abusive relationship. Her personal testimony has shocked me yet awoke in me things I know I have to watch for in choosing a mate. Hats off to Ms. Scott for her honesty and forthrightness in revealing her tragedy and her triumph!
4,Not what I thought,"I got this book expecting it would be all about Mt. Everest but come to find out only about 3 to 4 pages pertain to Mt. Everest and the rest of the book talks about how other mountains, rivers are made. So I think whom ever makes the discription for Amazon needs to re-word it and say 3 to 4 pages are about Mt. Everest and the rest of the book is on other mountains and rivers and how they are made.But I still like the book. It is very interesting over all."
2,I guess everyone is different...,"These pills do absolutely nothing for me. No energy, no curbed appetite. I even doubled up the dose to see if it made a difference. This is coming from someone who doesn't even drink caffeine or eat much sugar, so I honestly don't know what the problem was. I guess the effects are different for everyone, as all of the other reviews seemed to be pleased with the pills. I would recommend purchasing a smaller quantity first before spending so much on a large bottle - to make sure they're right for you."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This product is simply amazing. Just follow the directions and enjoy. No crash, no jitters, just a good energy shot.It takes about 5-10 minutes to really notice the effect, but if you're a man who works 12hr shifts regularly this is a ->MUST HAVE<- product. I was so impressed whem I tried it at vitamin world that I now buy it in bulk!"
1,save your money,"It might be inexpensive and you could be tempted but this is the most worthless product I have ever bought! I love the warning on the back, ""DO NOT EXCEED 4 TABLETS IN ANY 8-HOUR PERIOD."" That statement means nothing. I was falling asleep taking these pills, so I took twice the recommended dosage and I had to have a supplemental low carb energy drink as well. There must be less caffeine per pill than what's in a diet soda. Highly unrecommended! Seriously just buy a vitamin B supplement and drink a caffeinated soda. Actually, just buy straight caffeine pills...way more effective and less trips to the restroom..."
1,Make me more tired!,I used to use these pills back in the day for college( about 8 years ago) and they worked great. Now these pills just make me even more tired and give me a stomach ache and give me hearburn. The recipe changed and or my body does not process them the same way anymore. Either way red bull and any other energy drink keep me alive much better than these chumps.
4,Great Supplement,"Had purchased from Walmart a couple of times, found much better pricing at Amazon. I take pain meds on a daily basis, which make me very tired. This product really helps offset the fatigue without making me feel jittery. Tried Rx pills to help reduce fatigue and these are just as good without the side effects. Gave them to my son, who is a full time student and works part-time. Has to drive long distances every week and felt safe giving him these as they are natural products. Will definitely buy again in the future."
2,Energy,"I thought that this would replace the Monster drinks, it gave me little to no energy at all! Thanks Jeff"
1,Hate it,"Not only didn't it give me energy, but it made me ultra jittery or nervous.. I couldn't even work out that day.. I was so unfocused ugggggghhhhh what a waste!!"
3,Not what I was hoping,"I got these to help give me energy through the day. They did a little but not as good as I was hoping after reading other peoples reviews. Drink coffee instead, you will get more of a boost."
4,Provides that extra boost of enery in the afternoon,"Have you ever gotten groggy in the afternoon (especially after a big lunch)? I know I am guitly of fighting sleep in the afternoon. I have tried several different products and this one works the best, and with no side effects. However, even these pills don't help enough if I didn't get enough sleep the night before, so it is no substitute for a good nights sleep."
2,These gave me NO energy,"So, after carefully searching around the internet and reading reviews, I decided to try these. I am so disappointed. These did nothing. What attracted me to these in particular is that they claim to not give you jitters (which is the only reason I gave them 2 stars) because they definitly do not. I felt no different after taking these. No more energy, didnt notice being any more alert. I could not be any more disappointed, one single cup of coffee gives me more energy than these do. So beware buying these - if you are looking for an energy pill that gives you noticeably more energy these are not for you!"
4,Great For a Little Lift,"These tablets are great for a little extra lift, but I found that they didn't give the long term boost in energy that I was hoping for. I also wasn't really looking for a curbed appetite as I was recovering from a viral infection and just wanted an energy boost to get back to normal.I also tried the Gene Eden Supplement, to help me get over the virus which I thought was great and I felt my energy renewed so quickly as well as recovering quickly from the virusIt certainly may be worth a look.Gene-Eden: Antiviral Natural Remedy for Latent HPV, EBV, Herpes, Hepatitis, Safe, Effective, Patented Formula"
3,Energize,"These are all natural energizer pills to help give extra energy during a long day. Start off with one pill as directed, then two pills for the entire day are plenty. They work fairly well, but personally i would prefer something with ephedra. I give them a medium rating."
2,Not Great,I've been using this for 3 weeks and haven't had any increase energy. However the muscle pains are real but the problem is there just aren't good energy pills on the market
4,All Day Energy - Genuine claim,"I usually take a couple of these pills in the morning if I had very little sleep the night before. While they can only go so far in combatting fatigue, I would definitely say they are better than a few cups of coffee, and don't have any 'crash' that a sharp intake of caffeine might produce later.Highly recommended for use against tiredness."
4,Energize,"I have used this product for years. I take two tablets a day. While it does not give me that complete energy level that it did when I first started taking it, I can certainly tell when I have run out and miss several days. No jitters, no sudden drop like some other products do."
4,Work well for me,"These seem to do what they promise: provide mild sustainable energy for an extended period of time.I knocked off a star for the coloring. I took one with damp hands the other day, and afterwards noticed the pale blue dye all over my palm. This seems excessive, as I'd rather not be dying my insides unless absolutely necessary."
1,I really wanted this book,I read it once and i liked it a lot but then the second time i started Coding along the lines. And i am sorry that i have to say this but the code just doenst work the way its in the book.The Code on the CD is a bit better but still there are things in that code that just wont let me compile it. I checked the Msdn and everything and its just not right.I wish this book had a website with corrections because the book itself is good and thats what leads me to write this. I liked reading the book and wanted to program the stuff so bad and so i expected more from the code in it.I hope this helps
2,This book sucks for the people who don't know DirectX,"I will make this review short. The book is like the Documentation that came with the DirectX Software Development Kit. But the worst reason that makes me write this review give it horrible rating is some of the stuff in the book or example code on the CD doesn't work. I'm not sure if directX changed since the book published. Anyway, I'm not a noob in programming, I'm a senior in college major in computer science, so I know the code doesn't work not because I forgot to link some stupid library. Example, like the texture example code from chapter 3 doesn't work."
2,Alexandra repeats...,"Throughout the book I felt little sympathy for Alexandra, the insipid, self-centred, child neglecting, actress whose shallow experience was deepened by the sudden death of her husband and the subsequent revelations that recast her whole married life. Weldon deliberately undermines our sympathy for Alexandra by emphasising her acquiescence in the face of every other character. Her thoughts are peppered with compulsive cash valuations of everything she looks at. I felt schadenfreude when her husband's voice delivered the final confirmation of the lie that she had been living through his betrayal and her vanity. Weldon's conclusion is a damp squib which sees Alexandra sailing into the future looking forward to doing it all again."
2,Should have been a short story,"I do think Fay Weldon is a very good writer, and will probably read other books of hers.But, this particular story was a disappointment. It should have been about an eighth as long as it was. And, it just didn't make any sense. Alexandra was endlessly in denial, and pathetically obliging when it came to allowing people to step all over her. The attacks seemed very unrealistic, and mind-numbingly repetitive.And the fact that she, Alexandra, kept being referred to as she, Alexandra, yes, she, Alexandra, I'm talking about her, Alexandra. Arrrrg! What was that all about?"
2,From bad to worse.,"First, Alexandra takes absolutely forever to get out of denial about the character of her husband--not credible at all. I don't believe anyone is that stupid. The reader is shouting, ""You moron!"" The lead character and story start out bad (Alex is even mean to the dog) and then all the characters and the story go downhill from there. Her late husband, her friends, and even her mother become more abominable. Injustice piles upon injustice. A. doesn't do any of the things we are rooting for her to do to make things right. She's appalling, utterly shallow and inert, and the ending is a terrible waste. The only excuse I could think of for such an awful story is that Ms. Weldon had bad things done to her and this was her revenge. P.S. I didn't find any humor. There was irony, sarcasm, bitterness, but not humor."
4,cast iron hand pump,"the style of this pump is what we have been looking for. when we put it together, we had to do some tweeking to get the bolts to fit and the weather rusted the bolts quickly so we are going to replace them with stainlees."
1,mine was painted inside,"The pump I received had a smelly green paint in places where it contacts the water.The internals of the pump had what looked like a reddish primer coat of paint.I did not want my drinking water in conact with this paint, so I spent about 10 hours sanding it off with a rotary tool."
1,Cheap case,"This case only lasted about two weeks before it started coming apart and with it on the phone, it is hard to hear the phone ring. Would not recommend."
3,Good overall,The look and style is nice and it definitely helps protect the phone. The fit isn't great since it is 2 halves that snap together. My bottom half tends to slide down. Also the access to the charger connection is somewhat blocked.
5,Well worth the read,"Whether you go ahead and work with a therapist using this approach or not, just the reading alone can be enormously helpful. It was for me. I think with this view I am finally getting to the root of why the CFS took hold and what causes the various symptoms, and this education/perspective is helping me get going so the symptoms can loosen their grip, not only for CFS but for other sub-optimal reactions my body has developed over the years that lessen a full experience of life."
5,A great help in lowering stress,"This is a very good tool for those serious about lowering their stress levels. Dr. Miller knows what he is talking about. I recommend the book.Wayne D. Ford, Ph.D., author of ""Stress Management for Over-Achievers"" docwifford@msn.com"
1,Old Junk,"If you want it for a museum it's okay, other than that, it's prehistoric, huge, and outdated.Don't waste your money on this dinosaur."
2,eh... no thanks.,"I picked this one up thinking of something more along the lines of Bust a Groove-- no such luck. It's very cutesie, and if you like cheesy disco (new and old) it's probably a lot of fun. But if you don't like listening to 'YMCA' or 'Barbie Girl' over... and over... and over again, stay away at all costs.The game is set 200 years in the future, in a city where dancing has been outlawed. Guided by the ultimate dancer 'Dr. Dance', You guide three (squeaky) girls through learning to be superstar dancers. Like Charlie's Angels, but not.Control in the game is based off of the two analog sticks, and you must move them around in synch (no pun intended) to the music. The closer on beat you are, the better your rating for that move.I suppose in a party situation-- drunk and amongst other drunks--this game would be pretty amusing."
4,"Great game, but a little too easy",".... It's challenging at first, but pretty soon the game just becomes way too easy with a mediocre storyline. So if you are looking for a relatively easy but interesting game, pick up Unison."
2,Rent it before you buy this game,"The graphics and the music of the game are great. However this game can not be played with dance pad. I thought this game like the Britney's Dance Beat game can play with dance pad, but it is not. I am very disappointed."
1,How Do You Even Play?,This was a very confusing game. I just couldn't figure out what to do and there were no instructions. I tried playing it for two days until I finally gave up and returned it.
5,Great historic book,"I recommend this book to everyone who will visit Cumberland. It has a great deal of historic info and lovely stories about really strong and interesting women. After reading the book and visiting island, I felt like beeing touched by enormous force of very complex yet beautiful part of american history. America have amazing places to visit, memorable characters and wild, beautiful nature. I highly suggest this book to everyone interested in American Southern history."
1,my husband was quoted in this book without even being interviewed,"My husband was quoted in this book without even being contacted by this author. The author never once attempted to contact my husband for an interview. Yet, he proceeded to quote him without ever speaking to him! We are/have been current full-time residents of Cumberland Island. My husband has been through 4 land condemnations with the NPS to have the house we have now. This is a total trash book. Until my husband can write his own book, I would strongly suggest Mary Bullard's book, Cumberland Island A History. The bibliography is wonderful and the book is FACTUAL, unlike this one."
3,Nothing special but very handy,"This is just your common socket with pull chain. It sure made it easy to install a new light in my garage though. Just extended the pull line, plugged the light into a ceiling socket and saved what would have been at least $200 for an electrician to put in a wall switch."
5,Awesome,"What a simple item to make sure your screenplay at least doesn't suck when it comes to how it's held together :)My only gripe is that I only got the one tiny box of a hundred washers and not the extra 9 boxes that some of the lucky purchasers were fortunate to have gotten (Boo!). Ah well, still a great little product and worth the price."
2,"Good product idea, bad results","I like the Eclipse setup--I think it helps the overall look of a fish tank and simplifies the lighting/filtration process. However, this being my second purchase of the lamp base, I haven't been impressed with the quality of the product. As with my old model, one of the light sockets (this being a twin tube model) doesn't work, so in essence I have only one working light (thought it was the bulb at first, but didn't turn out to be the case). Additionally, this thing gets so hot (again, I've had this product in the past so I'm going off of experience) that the plastic in the lamp base actually starts to get warped. The plug adapter is also hot. Coincidence that this happened to me twice now? I think not. Instead, I've purchased an LED light and removed the Eclipse system entirely."
4,batman and robin,"it is a decent dvd. Acting was okay. I liked it, it had a good villian but they should have used some one like the joker or panquin. The wizard wasnever in the comics but he was a noble villian for batman. Robins costum was okay but batmans was bad. I know it was 1949 not 2005 but his bat ears was not sticking up they were sticking to the side. The bat car was a normal car. When bruce wayan drove it the top was down when batman drove it the topwas up. Like that is much of a disgise. When I got it I knew it made back in 1949 so I wasn't expecting much but it was alot better than i thought it was a good story and it was a good mysterey."
2,Batman on a Low Budget,"Upon viewing the first chapter, it's obvious that ""Batman and Robin"" (1949) will not emerge as one of the all-time great serials. With producer Sam Katzman at the helm, it's bargain-basement all the way - right down to the cheap costumes and an incredibly poor excuse for a Batmobile. Despite low-budget shortcomings, there's plenty of hokey fun as Batman and Robin face one contrived cliffhanger after another. The mysterious Wizard makes for an interesting villain, since he never appeared in the comic books. Robert Lowery does a good job as Batman, but John Duncan's Boy Wonder looks like a juvenile delinquent. It's nice to see character actor Lyle Talbot as Commissioner Gordon, even though he has a tendency to activate the Bat Signal in broad daylight. Flaws and all, ""Batman and Robin"" is an undeniable guilty pleasure."
3,For completist collectors,"This 1949 serial will be of interest mainly to Batman and/or serial fanatics. It is fun to watch, though much of the fun comes from the improbabilities and inconsistencies. For instance, there's no Batmobile, just a car which can be identified as Bruce Wayne's car. Nobody except Bruce Wayne's girl friend, Vickie Vale, seems to notice this.There are very few good chapter endings here. Most of them are either lame or boring or borderline cheating.The characters are interesting, though. The villianous Wizard'sidentity is of course kept secret until the last chapter, and you're given several red herrings to puzzle over, one of which is a bit overly done.A serial based on as popular a comic book hero as Batman should've been much better, but those who really enjoy the genre will probably want this, chiefly because it's one of the two serials featuring the Dynamic Duo."
2,I cannot believe this is available.....,.....and not the Adam West batman from the 60s. That's the 1960s in case my criticism remains valid beyond 2060.I have seen some of the 1940s episodes and they are mostly of interest to batman ultra-fans and cultural historians.
2,Rent Before You Buy,The title says it all. Rent before you buy. I watched this in about a day. The chapters are really short. (about 15 minutes) This is the kind of movie you watch when you don't have anything else to do. There are a few suprises in the plot. Vicki Vale's character doesn't help either. Lois Lane is a lot better. I have to say that the two Superman serials starring Kirk Allen and even the other Batman one starring Lewis Wilson and J. Carol Naish is a lot better then this! This is the poorest quality movie serial I've seen!
2,"""Batman and Robin"" (1949)","I would like to review the 1949 serial, but it has been confused with the awful 1997 film. There should be a separate video entry for the serial."
2,Not my cup of Bat-tea,"This DVD is just not doing it for me. I gave it two stars for the menu and presentation. But the Films are preaty bad. the Bad guy is lame, and the acting was piss poor. everything about it just smacked of lame. i know it was the 1940's but thats not the problem its just not that interesting."
3,Batman Bloopers,"There were many scenes which kept me tied to my seat but I did notice some bloopers that could have been easily avoided. Maybe it is not fair to compare the 40's Batman style to the 60's, 80's and 90's style as it progresed as time went on. They got a fancy Batmobile, a different way of entering the Batcave, among other advanced changes. One thing that was kept the same, Batman knew the criminals move even before the criminals made their move. Personally, I prefer the cloth outfits in the 60s Batman to the rubber ones in they wore in the 80s and 90s version."
5,BETTER THAN ANY OF THE BATFILMS FROM KEATON TO CLOONEY,"Okay, okay! I know the budget was almost non existant. But I'm referring to the fun, excitement, and adventure! Something modern day film makers have either forgotten or just prefer the special effects tell the story instead. All the shortcomings mentioned in other reviews are true. However the shortcomings are as human as the people involved. This can be watched almost anytime but my favorite time is on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Robert Lowrey's contrasting portrayal of Bruce Wayne and Batman is still the best on screen performance I've ever seen. So if you're really into Batman and all his incarnations, buy this. I promise youll enjoy it immensly. It is far more entertaining than the 1997 Clooney, O'Donnell version of the same name."
2,"not tat all ""complete""","This is a 2-disc set. Disc one has episodes 1 through 4, disc two has episodes 9 through 12. IOW, not even close to a complete set. I just hate being lied to..."
2,Standard cops-and-robbers; add one star for the second half,"This is NOT the campy, politically incorrect 1943 serial with zombies, alligators, and ray guns. Rather, this is the 1949 sequel, which is a straight crime melodrama with good and bad points in about equal measure. On the minus side, the first half doesn't go anywhere, with a sketchy story and unimpressive action (Batman's dangerous leaps are shown in ""safe"" close shots, for example). The script is uneven, the identity of the masked villain is predictable, and the production values are of the bargain-basement variety. On the plus side, however, decent direction and a hard-working cast smooth over the rough spots, and things get moving in the second half (faster pace, more elaborate stunts).Both halves average out to an average serial, disappointing for Batman enthusiasts but okay for serial fans and B-movie buffs. Picture and sound quality are very good."
4,a great action packed serial,this 1949 serial is a sequel to the 1943 batman serial and i must say i was suprised at how good it really was. sure somethings look and sound silly now but at the time thesr movies were the best thig about going to the movies on saturday in the 30's and 40's. my boy get a real kick watching these old serials and we will watch them together when we can. this is a very good transfer and the sound is also very good. check it out
2,A History of the Academy Awards or a Political Diatribe?,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first Inside Oscar with its biting wit and humorous anecdotes. This one is more of a straightforward history minus a lot of the humourous quips and observations of the first. The late Mason Wiley is truly missed. Damien Bona also runs the risk of offending about 53% of the audience (after the 2002 election) with his subjective statements like ""as if Republicans were dear hearts and gentle people"" and general nasty comments about everyone from Bob Dole to George Bush (43).It's enough that we have to hear these comments from the Hollywood ""elite"" (Barbara Streisand, Alec Baldwin, Bill Maher, et al.) Recommended only for a read through, it's not quite as captivating as its predecessor."
4,A mixed bag,"One of the great things about Inside Oscar 2 is how detailed it is about the movies that were not just nominated but were contenders. You really get a clear picture of the years 1995 to 2000. The writing is strong and there are some very funny passages in the book. One of the drawbacks is how opinionated the book is. In Inside Oscar there may be some brief sentences on how a some critic or critics disliked a movie. That was fine. Here you have Bona going on and on about how he disliked it and while sometimes that can be funny, I am not sure it follows the path set by Inside Oscar. Exceptions in Inside Oscar the years 1993 and 1994. The book is strong enough that it still is worth reading and owning even with that flaw."
5,Time for a sequel,"Authors please...it's time for a ten year update. Or has it only been nine years? Anyway, hope it's in preparation!"
2,Too small,Not very practical; too small for most beverages (things get stuck & when you attempt to take a drink the entire holder comes with it.) Direct donation to Goodwill.
2,disappointing,"Unfortunately, the rotating handle on these pruners make it very difficult to use and definitely did not help in the pruning work. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Great Clippers,"Toro makes quality. This is another example.Tired of purchasing second rate pruners that don't perform or last. Also purchased long handle ""loper"" style for limbing small trees and bushes. works equally well."
2,"Good Garbage can, but the price is not right.","This is a very good large trash can. I am giving it 2 stars because I bought the same product at Home Depot for 56 dollars, which is about half the price."
2,trash can,Poor quality for the price. I know it will not last very long. Walmart has a bigger and stronger one for much less money. definitely not even close to commercial quality.
2,Prices is too High,The price is a little high...... this product is just a plastic tank !! and they sell it as a Best quality product and it's OK that's all
1,Waste of money,"For that amount of money I can buy at least five trash cans, who needs such a large trash can anyway?"
2,Get what you pay for.,Thought I was getting a good deal vs the big box hdwre stores but Both plate covers I bought cracked when i screwed them on!I know not to screw to hard but the least tightening caused them to crack..............too bad.
1,Same firmness as Silly Putty,This putty is not firm at all. I just ended up getting the magnetic putty at Think Geek which is really firm and gives me some kind of resistance. Power Putty had the same firmness as an ordinary chewing gum. Waste of money for me.
3,Be Aware: ExpressCard only available on newer notebooks,"I assumed that my Dell Inspiron 9300 was new enough to use this card, but I was wrong. The 9300 has the older CardBus or PCMCIA type slot. Only after reading about ExpressCard in Wikipedia did I realize I had made a big mistake. It is a newer faster interface that is not compatable with CardBus. Oh Well, maybe it's time to get a more modern computer so I can use my fancy new soundcard!"
5,Wisdom from America's Neighbor,"Where are the Mr. Rogers of today? There aren't many, UNLESS people read and learn from his words. Get wise--read this book!"
4,A good resource...,I thought this book was a great resource for Chinese and Ayurvedic remedies that address alcohol related ailments. I also appreciate that this is written for the 'middle of the road' audience that strive for balance and do not need AA. I enjoyed it and will most likley use it as a resource for the future!
4,Another solid action figure from McFarlane's,"I just love this toy. Even though it doesn't have that much action to pose because the big gun she's holding was quite heavy and her arms keep falling when I try to place the gun higher, the figure still have nice pose that comes handy with the base. Overall this is an excellent of She-Spawn so far."
4,Pretty much all the Klami you need,"He has written some symphonies and I had tried to get into one of those, no success. Though samples of Symphony 2 hold promise (still looking for cheap disc).Terhenniemi of the kalevala suite is an instantly recognizanle tune. It has all the orchestral effects of Klami. The quiet and loud passages.You can think of Klami as an overly melodramatic Sibelius, but they are very different in other ways too.Cobblers on the heath Overture is worth looking up on other discs.The playing is fine."
2,Good - too bad you can't hear it.,"No point belaboring this: I downloaded the Mp3 from Amazon, thinking that would avoid a possible problem such as the reviewer above had. No such luck. The music is audible and more or less enjoyable, but at about one-third the appropriate level, it's nothing I'd consider playing for others. I suggest you look elsewhere. (The Iceland Symphony has a new recording of this on the Chandos label)"
1,terrible recording,There is much fine music on this disc. The engineering is lousy. It is recorded at an extremely low level except for the forte passages which blast out at an unpleasantly loud and ear shattering volume. Avoid this disc!
2,Brilliant music badly recorded,"I was happy when found this title on amazon - it is one of my favorite musics. Unfortunately, CD is recorded with very low level of sound, at least in comparison with other CDs I have. If this record should be playing only on special equipment, would be better to make this warning. You are warned now. I am looking now for another recording of Klami, may be by Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra (4509-99968-2), unfortunately, not available on Amazon."
3,The Box Car Children Rock!,"Henry, Jeessie, Violet, and Benny's parn\ents died and they end up living in a box car from an old train. They could have gone to their grandpa, but they thought he was mean. Then finally when Henry was working, he heard that his grandpa was looking for them. So Henry told the news to the lthers and they decided to go and live with their grandfather. One day Benny found a diary and the mystery began. They found out that the diary was a little girl's. They found the diary behind the wall with some coins. How Benny found was by having an idea to put a hole in the wall and a bell to wake Benny or Rory up. That's when Benny found the dairy when he was working on his idea."
1,Did not work for me,"I had used Proactiv for many years and liked it, but was curious to see if there was anything new that could be just as good, or better (and gentler). I was excited to try this Philosophy kit. What a disappointment!I used it for 2 weeks and my skin got worse, breaking out in places I usually don't break out (like my forehead and chin, with lots of little pimples). I contacted their customer services and was told the ""purging"" process (which they never advertised) would take a week or 2. Well, after 2 weeks, I stopped using the product and am now back to Proactiv, hoping to reverse the damage I got from this Philosophy kit."
4,Spyder fasta LCD loader,"this loader is the only loader (that ive tried) that can keep up with me and my rocking trigger. much faster then my old Evo 3. There are Three issues that i have had with this loader. First, that lid is a real pain in the butt to open (real tight fitting). Second, since this isnt a true forcefeed loader, the last few balls seem to bounce around a bit before feeding (so i have to slow down when im getting low (20 to 30 balls remaining)). And lastly, its tough, yet the lid itself is fragile. was painting it and when i took the tape off the lid, only pulled at a slight angle, one of the hinge points snapped off (so i had to take it apart and epoxy it back together). All in all this loader has worked real well with me, but i do recommend and upgrade to the lid... like a quick feed or something along those lines."
2,audio bad worse than the old LP's,"A marvelous singer that I have loved since I was a child, singing the songs of his that I have enjoyed all these many years. The sad part of the recording is that the sound hasn't been reworked and it sounds worse that the old LP. It's really sad that they would issue this great recording in such a sad state. If you don't mind the bad fidelity, you will enjoy this."
3,Great Quality but buy 2,"so I dj and need some of these wires..anyway i got it but only 1 wire so make sure you buy 2 for left and right channels..the description fails to state its only ""1"" wire. maybe im wrong but most others come in pairs."
4,Good for what it tries to do but...,"The book is a very good exploration of the perspective it starts from - which is basically that objects are state machines (known as entity life histories in SSADM).It shows how a reusable method is found where two or more events have the same effect, at the same state, in a state machine.And its (partly automated) derivation of event-oriented procedures from object-oriented state machines is remarkable.However, a weakness is that the discussion is all about method bodies rather than interfaces. And the authors are not enthusiastic about inheritance or polymorphism."
3,Works for the Vibro Champ XD but cheap,"This works for the Vibro Champ XD. Its a little big but that means I can cover the amp w/o removing the plug.It looks fine but for the price its only ""ok"". Maybe I'm spoiled but I have a VOX amp cover for my AC4TV and it is nicely made, lined with a little padding for a few bucks more. This Fender cover is just a shaped vinyl bag and the results of being lazy.Works on: Super Champ XD, Vibro Champ XD, Champ 110, Champ 30/110 and GDEC30The plus is that my home it looks less cluttered which is what I wanted."
2,"Lags, skips, do NOT recommend","Just returned this item as it works pretty badly. Instruction is not very straightforward but OK, programming OK.The biggest concern is that you need to hold button for at least 2 sec, otherwise button is not recognized. BUT, once you hold for a little bit longer (say 2.2 sec) it will send two or more commands in a row, which means you would skip more than one track or mute and immediately unmute. I would by metra device instead"
1,Slow and Intermittent Responce,I installed this in my 02 Grand Cherokee with a JVC kds100 cd player. Installation was a bit tricky but just took a little time. Programming wasnt too bad to do. It seems to work slow when it works at all... The volume up and down will work half the time and the other commands work very rarely. Not sure if I would even recommend this to anyone. Im goin to return this and just use my cd player remote instead.... SAVE YOUR MONEY JUST USE YOUR REMOTE
3,good product,"slow response time but it does the job, i recommend this product. more usefull and worth the $$ if you have multiple functions on your wheel. i have volume and channel up and down...if i new about the slow response i most likey would not have spent the extra $$ for this item. none the less it does what it claims and is a good product....install was easy and the support tech from PAC was great"
5,Works well!,"After installing an aftermarket stereo in my Jeep, I wanted to restore the functionality of the factory steering wheel controls. This adapter works wonderfully. Instructions were clear, although some of the programming steps can be a bit complicated (I had to make two attempts to program it, which isn't bad, however), but once programmed, it works great. It even allowed me use a couple of buttons for slightly different purposes than with the factory radio."
2,Steering Wheel Controller,"I still haven't gotten this thing to work. Whomever said this was easy to install told a lie. The instructions was very unclear and I had to go online to find my truck for the preparation configuration and still was confused.I would recommend you go to a professional installer and purchase it there and let them install it, b/c now I am going to have to have them do it for me and that means more money being spent!"
4,"Good...""Almost"" Like from the Factory","I installed this with a Kenwood Kdc-Hd545U in a 2007 Honda Civic Si. I was unable to get the ""Mode"" (aka ""Source"") button to work, but the channel up/down and volume up/down controlls work well. There is a slight amount of ""lag"" in pressing the button, but I expected this after reading the other reviews.It was a bit of a struggle to get it installed, but I just kept at it until I got it right. I'm glad other had some difficulty with it becuase I felt like a dummy trying to get it working.At any rate, it does what I want it to do. I can change the volume and current song with my steering wheel controls."
1,brought back car 4 times but would stop working!,"The car place would reset the interface but it would stop working after a month or so. Went back 4 times with same problem could never fix, so i ordered new interface from axxess. It was installed on a 2008 F350"
1,Junk! Doesn't Work Right,"First, their site gave me the wrong directions. Took awhile to find the right ones. This thing once installed has never worked right. Sometimes it works fine, then randomly stops working all together. Mute button only works when I hold it down and it cycles on and off... I have to release it and hope it stops on mute. Volume works for about 4 notches, then won't go back down. Also, I need to push the buttons really hard to make this thing respond. Before it was just a light touch. This thing is irritating and frustrating. Go with the Axxess ASWC, same price, doesn't need to go though a complicated program process, and actually works!"
3,"Not bad, but has a few issues","This interface is kind of an industry standard because it works with so many brand and cars, but that doesn't make it perfect. While it works well most of the time, it sometimes send the wrong message. For example, I will press the button on my steering wheel to turn down the volume and the song will change. This doesn't happen often, but it does happen. The biggest issue is that it sometimes doesn't seem to want to work at all. I thought the buttons on my steering wheel were broken, so I took it in to have it checked and turned out that it was the interface. Oddly works better in cold weather, I can't explain that."
1,You are on your own,"Useless, nonsensical directions coupled with maddening, dismissive tech support make this product no better then a lump of bat turd in plastic packaging."
4,Works as intended. Installation is no cakewalk.,"I installed this in a 2006 Hyundai Sonata. The instructions are pretty clear. It states that one of the wires in the cars harness needs to be grounded for it work properly. The harness I purchased didn't have that cable on it's wires so I had to cut into the factory harness in order to ground it. Other than that, works as advetised. As others have stated, the response is a little delayed, but its better than having non functioning buttons on your steering wheel. I used it with a Clarion CX501 receiver and all the buttons perform as intended. Make sure you read over the instructions a few times as the setup is a little challening."
4,PAC SWIJACK Steering Wheel Remote Interface,"I had this device installed in a 2007 Honda Pilot, to go along with myJVC KW-AVX820 Double-DIN DVD/CD Multimedia Receiver with 7-Inch Widescreen Detachable Touch Panel Monitor, Bluetooth, and Full-Speed USB Port. As some others have written, the response after pressing buttons isn't instantaneous, but to be honest, I've gotten used to it, and now it seems pretty close to instant. It definitely beats the alternative of losing the steering wheel radio control option in my vehicle. I'm glad I bought it.."
4,Great product once I got it working!,"Spent a LONG time trying to get it to work (decent phone-in support from PAC) only to find out I had a faulty unit. Returned to Amazon... fast response but they sent me the wrong product the second time (wrong name on invoice and everything... first time this has happened to me w/Amazon). FINALLY got the product and installed and it works great. Many reviews spoke to a lag, buttons work instantly for me and flawlessly (so far). I mounted in a 2006 Tahoe with a Clarion radio. Did add an automotive relay at the recommendation of the manufacturer (sent me a schematic). 100% satisfied once I got the correct/working unit! Amazon had best price by a decent margin."
1,Did not work for me,"I bought this steering wheel remote interface because it was made by the same people that made the CAN interface (PAC C2R-CHY4) that I used. I figured that they would work together and there would be less wires to tap into. I couldn't get this thing to work at all. I went through the programming procedure at least 10 different times and could never get the thing to work. I could see the light on it blinking whenever I pressed the steering wheel control buttons but it never controlled my head unit. I was following the instructions from their website that were specific to my Dodge Challenger. It could be that my head unit is too new and is not supported (Alpine INE-S920HD). I don't know. After spending a couple of hours trying to make this thing work, I gave up and bought aMetra Axxess ASWC Universal Steering Wheel Control Interface (Black). The Metra worked right away with no programming. It's only drawback was that I had to cut into the CAN bus wires from the PAC C2R-CHY4."
2,"It's economics....but, I've read better",I had to read most of this book for my International economics class... I think the book tells you what you need to know but it was very difficult to understand. I usually had to read over the same thing 2 or 3 times before I actually started to grasp it. If I was a professior of this class I would seriously consider changing textbooks.
1,Poorly worded and poorly organized.,"There are far too many examples of confusing wording in this book so I will focus my rantings for the atrocious chapter structure. Chapter introductions will begin laying out a few main points that will be discussed, the first few points are covered and then it will jump to other somewhat related topics (i.e. Chapter 20 on Financial Crises...give it a closer look).Pugel unabashedly supports any idea that is pro-business with very little of the book addressing any of the troubling trends we are seeing in the world today as more markets are continually opened.Dump this book before you open it. Buy a Krugman textbook.Seasons greetings."
4,International Economics,The book was in great condition and priced very reasonably. The seller was so nice to upgrade the shipping for me even though I did not ask for expedited shipping originally (I did not calculate the timing correctly). Overall great experience.
3,Troubling and confusing for younger children,"This book may be a fine resource for professional therapists and grief counselors. But PLEASE don't drop it on a child who hasn't yet grappled with a death in the family. In the wake of the recent terrorist attacks, it's simplistic (and dishonest) to compare the loss of a grandparent with the demise of a hamster. In the interests of strict accuracy, why are extinct reptiles--all dinosaurs are dead!--sporting jeans and groomed hairstyles, sitting on the stoop of a brownstone? On an important topic like this, I'd prefer a realistic, honest, straightforward book featuring human beings."
4,Great book for kids,As a bereavement coordinator I had been looking for a book to explain death to children - this book explains it quite well. &#128515;
3,Overall a good start on a difficult subject,"My biggest problem with the book, would have to be the structure. It jumps from one type of family death to another (pet as opposed to a parent or grandparent) too quickly and in a confusing fashion. I think it would have been more effective if they had written it as a narrative of a young character learning a relative had died, and going through the stages of emotions, the funeral, aftermath, etc. Still, this book presents many of the situations kids are certain to go through when they lose a loved one (anger, denial) and for that I give much credit. I find it unfortunate that almost all authors of kids series that stress coping with new situations and rites of passage in life don't want to touch this subject, even though it is probably the most important issue that a child has to deal with at that age."
1,This is way too intense for young children,"People misunderstand how children feel on a daily basis. Children are not always happy worry free little people they are HUMANS too. Children have more stress they you know and why put them through any more than we have to. Everything we say or do deeply affects children. This book's intended purpose is to help deal with one of the hardest situation a parent or family member has to go through, but instead it would more likely create other difficult situations. I do not recommend this book for children under at least 10 years of age."
5,When Dinosaurs Die,"This is an excellent book. I purchased it to read to my almost 4 year old grandson whose ""grandpa"" died 3 months ago. I particularly enjoyed the way the book starts out with - What Does Alive Mean? and then goes on to explain what it means and also what dead means. The artwork is great and non threatening. This has become a favorite."
3,Helpful resource for grieving children,This book is a helpful resource for grieving children. It explains death and related concepts and normalizes feelings associated with grief.Counselors and therapists working with grieving children may also be interested in the following books:Creative Interventions for Bereaved ChildrenMourning Child Grief Support Group Curriculum: Middle Childhood Edition
1,Inappropriate for young kids,"I did not like this book at all, and thought it inappropriate for young children. My son kept asking why the children on the playground died, playing ""Bang, Bang your dead"". (I also don't want my son being taught games about violence.) I did not like suicide being presented as an ""option"" for hopelessness. Read this book before giving it to a child."
3,When Dinosaurs Die,"I bought this book to help answer my 4 year olds questions about death. I felt this book is too much information for that age. She needed answers not new fears. This book brings up suicide and drug abuse. More appropraite for an older child.The book ""Lifetimes"" was exactly what I needed."
2,When dinosaurs Die,I read it to my kids after they lost their Grandmother. I skipped most of the parts dealing with suicide and other really grown up subjects. Then I put the book in the closet. I did not like this book. And I think you should really borrow it from the library and read it first before you buy it.
3,1 out of 4 bad,"it's a light switch, 1 out of 4 is non working, not sure i would buy these again. will probably look for another brand in the future"
5,great book,"This is a wonderful children's book for boy siblings who have some competition going. It is a gentle reminder that we are each unique but can be loved equally. Had a copy years ago and my boys and I would read it over and over, someone lost it and have often wondered where it went. So I am giving both of my boys (even though one is 16) a copy for Christmas as a reminder that I love them."
5,Excellent Answer to a Common-Heartful Question,"My children ask this regularly, especially my six-year-old Emma.She wants so badly to be loved ""the best"".Through Joosse's book, I learned an incredible new way to express how I love her ""the purplest"" or the ""chocolatiest"" or ""the bell ringingest"".....By using a more descriptive word than ""Best"", the Mother in this book speaks to what is real and true about her sons Max and Julian so that they are each more than ""just satisfied"" with being loved the best.....She uses colors to describe her love for each of her boys after she has described other possibly conflict, competitive situations by being more specific with what is special instead of labeling or judging one above the other.More adults ought to read this one!"
3,Almost,"This book had a very cute premise; how do I love two children the same. However, the title was never fully explained. You had to draw your own conclusion, so I felt it fell short of helping a child get ""the purplest"" concept."
1,Just not good at all unless you are a plumber trying to make a lot of cash.,No one sells replacement parts for these valves unless you are a plumber. The anti siphon parts are plastic and only last a few years.Buy extra valves for parts in the future so you don't have to replace the whole valve. I could not possibly imagine how these would work in a cold climate where it might freeze.
2,Ok but not very good,"The quality of this product is OK. I'm looking for one with metal cap, but it's plastic, it looks like metal, but it's plastic coated with a metal paint. Before I bought it, I called the seller, they told me the cap is metal, it seems they don't know anything. The plastic cap is easy to be broken in the winter, I can get it in any hardware store at lower price."
5,Creatine: The end to the questions.,"Dr. Colgan gets another slam dunk with his book, Creatine for Muscle and Strength. There has been a lot of discussion about creatine since it had been labeled the muscle building wonder suppliment of the future. Dr. Colgan gives a straight-forward approach the use of creatine that is surely suited for success. Two thumbs up!"
4,"fans of ""faraquet"" take notice!","this group is comprised of ex members of the (much slept on) group ""faraquet"" whos release, ""the view from this tower"" was an amazing feat to say the least. anyway i am not going to bore you with the typical review. if you like dischord's music and/or faraquet, you'll like this. it is slower (than a view from..) but just as intricate and jagged. think ""faraquet"" meets ""lungfish"" meets ""seven storey mountain"". check it out."
2,weak,"don't waste your time with this unless you're desperate for a bad faraquet album. too much crappy pop singing. there are some really cool parts, but... it's no faraquet. get the faraquet/akarso split and save time and money. if you want weak puss puss stuff, then go back and get smart went crazy. i was totally let down by hearing both these medications albums. they've lost their edge, and their intensity is what i believe made farquet so great. :-( i believe there is hope though, these dudes are MEGA TALENTED. maybe the next album will capture a better mood than this one."
3,Missing too much - or I am expecting too much,"Maybe I am asking too much from a Level 1 reader. My incentive for buying this book was to inculcate my 5 year old son on the dangers of fire. Everything that I wanted like: How fire spreads, air is needed to sustain fire was not in the book.If you have a child who does not ask ""Why"" to everything, then this book would be OK. It covers Stop, Drop, Roll (again no reason WHY that is a good thing to do), fire drills, turning matches into grown-ups and safety percautions as well as uses for fire."
3,"OK, but could have been better","Good Morning, Night touches on a very real, gutsy kidnap-murder of an Italian prime minister in the late '70s, but gets bogged down in talk and is shot mostly on one set. It could have been better if they inserted a scene of the actual kidnapping and murder, and if it gave the watcher more background and information on the notorious Red Brigades, which The Best of Youth does a good job of. I would also recommend The Cyclops Hammer, a novel, for those interested in the Red Brigades. It is an in-depth, fictionalized account of the Red Brigades based on real events, and blends historical fact with fiction."
3,It okay,It is hard to get the pancake to release from the mold. Used cooking spray but the tips of the star holds the pancake.
5,Damn Good Comp..,"Well, I'll make this one short, this is a good compilation, very good. Some of the better mixes of the best in the biz, by the best in the biz. If you like BT, Moby, or any of the artists on this one in the least, you'll enjoy the entire album totally. Give it a listen."
3,Great Item in a lousy bottle,I was thrilled to find Gianfranco Ferre! I love the perfume and it smells as wonderful as I remember. However this particular bottle was a disappointment as the atomizer bottle doesn't work and leaks all over my fingers when I use it - wasting the cologne. I would still get this again in hopes that every now and then it's just the bottle and not the fact that I bought it on line.
5,Incredible,This is an incredible performance of Die Frau Ohne Schatten. The centre of attention is Christa Ludwig giving the performance of her life! She's theatre personified. Nobody can touch her in the role of the Dyer's Wife. Leonie Rysanek is also irreplaceable as the Empress. And the VPO plays splendidly.
4,Exactly What I needed!,This was exactly what I needed. I chose to install a timer switch in my entryway and the fit and finish of this cover was great! Definitely recommend to anyone!
4,Wallplate,Great thick wallplate. Fits well with switch. Love my timer switches. The Leviton 80405-W 2-Gang 1 Toggle 1 Decora/GFCI Device Combination Wallplate was delivered in a timely manner.
4,Leviton 005-80405-00W 2-Gang Wallplate,"Great quality plate. It was however wrapped in very thin & brittle plastic that broke during handling or shipping, so a couple small screws were lost. Leviton's plate is great, Leviton's product wrapping is poor."
5,nice,This is a beautiful piece of plastic. I've had plastic ones before but this one is flawless. I really like the shape and subtle curves. The holes are perfectly placed and the everything fit really well.
2,Didn't come with enough screws,"The plate is OK. The standard switch side fit my existing standard switch and the GFI (large opening) side fit my newly installedAube by Honeywell TI070-3W/U ECONO Switch Programmable Timer Switch, Whitejust fine. What I found reduced the value of this plate considerably was the screws that came with it. There was one long screw (that matched the four long screws I removed along with the existing ""standard"" two switch wall plate, and one short screw.Turns out you can use either short or long screws on the ""standard switch"" side but require short screws on the GFI side (or you can needlessly drill holes in your wall so the longer scerws will work). The picture shows four screws and I would have expected, at a minimum, to have four screws supplied with the product."
1,Terrible Cheap Plastic,"There's not much to say about this product, other than it's a cheap thin type of plastic which cracks as soon as you screw it to the wall."
1,Do not waste your money on this cheap wallplate,"I had bought ($5.40) this wall-plate to match my backs-plash from Amazon.Its not brown, more of a dark, dark brown, almost looks black and absolutely cheap quality with no brown screws to go with it!Go to Lowes and get your self a QUALITY wall plate, I did!"
2,Beware....it's made of plastic,"Wall plate was plastic. Fit was OK. I tightened it down too tight and it cracked. Now I'll need to get a metal wall plate to replace it. I should have just bought a metal one initially. It did have an extra screw in the package, so no complaint of a shortage of screws."
1,"Do Not Buy, Doesn't Fit !!!","I bought one of these and found the face of the wallplate had a scratch across the entire length right out of the wrapper. So I wasted some more gas to get a replacement, only to find that it doesn't fit. Yep, something as simple as a wallplate, which have been around since the invention of light switches. Yep, leave it up to outsourcing to China to explain how this Decora wallplate won't fit a GFCI outlet or Decora toggle, or any device with that rectangular shape. Apparently the suits at Leviton don't bother to check product quality as long as their product costs are minimized. If there was true justice in the world, they would lose their jobs over this stupidity rather than the innocent American workers they laid off to outsource. And I ain't a union guy, either."
2,not about the show...,"One of those funny semi-trashy romance novels... I mistakenly ordered this thinking it was about the ""Twin Peaks"" television series. Very un-PC story about a girl raised by ""natives."" Amusing purchase."
2,they changed it..,"at first I tasted it was looking for somekind of explanation why it didn't knock my socks off like it usually does .. the black tea taste is a bit stronger and the herbal taste is a bit weaker... I noticed it's ''made in China"" I can't say if it was made in China before but it really doesn't taste the same ... still O K but for the higher price,it's not worth it for OK tea.."
2,"starts good, but degenerates","The first few episodes of this series will hook you in to keep watching because its great (acting, unique story line, etc), but as the series progresses the writers started working in modern day subversive topics such as acceptance of gay and lesbians into the story lines.Imagine watching a movie about Daniel Boone and having the story line be about eastern city people concerned that Daniel's walks in the woods could lead to people moving out of the city and reducing the tax base. It just wouldn't work and it would convince you that the writer of the movie was trying to promote some agenda. The later episodes of Foyle's War leave you with that feeling."
5,"Foyle's War, Series 1-3","This is a great series of BBC movies. Well written and well acted. I wasn't born at the time of the war so I can't definitively comment on the period costumes and scenery--but on the surface it looks well researched.The quality of the video is not as good as more recent TV dramas, but it is good enough."
5,A Blistering Debut!!!!!,"Face down are so overlooked, their first album compared to Machinehead (often too compared) was an excellent piece of work, listening to it now I hear more than Machinehead. Face Down had a slight death metal edge to them making them heavier (and better in my opinion) than Machine Head.I can also hear a dash of Entombed in there and even a tad of Fear Factory. The more you listen to them the more individual they are.Their second album `The Twisted Rule the Wicked' was also very good but I do think that `Mindfield' was the bomb! Prepare for Face Down's return this year! Signed to the Swedish Label Black Lodge Records they are back and stronger than ever!!!!!"
3,The Whole Story?,"Just curious for those who have read this book...Does it go into the possibility that his execution was faked and he escaped to America. In the small town of Cleveland, NC at Third Creek Presbyterian Church there is a tomb that many claim to be the burial site of Marshal Michel Ney...The Bravest of the Brave."
4,Articulate,"Great fun, a combination of Password and Trivial Pursuit...however, the American version seems a bit dumbed down from the English version. We played with 10 people one night and had a marvelous time."
2,Dreams and Riddles,"Shaber is great fun. Her music is great for car rides and having fun. She doesn't really get too terribly introspective, often singing of dreams about famous singers and ridiculous riddles. This CD really only has one or two songs that you leave with to sing later....nothing really gets stuck in your head. Very enjoyable, but not amazing."
2,"Great cutting power, but blade lock is badly designed","I was thrilled when I first began to use this project - it's very sharp & very strong, crunching through small bones with ease. However, the safety lock is in a bad place - it's small & easily engaged, and on quite a few occasions now, the mere action of cutting - when the lock gets sideswiped by the chicken itself - will engage the lock, and then I have to manually open it up again. It's EXTREMELY irritating - I would call it a major design flaw. If it weren't for that lock, I'd reccomend these shears to anyone - but I'd hesitate to recommend them now. I will deal with them, and I'm sure there's a way to learn to live with them well (after all, they do cut beautifully, so long as you can avoid activating that lock) - but I don't feel there should need to be a ""break-in"" period for a new pair of poultry shears!"
1,Not recommended,"I agree with kitchen junkie; the lock is a major design flaw. I've found it's nearly impossible to cut up as little as a quarter chicken without the shears locking up at least once. Plus, I'd read reviews (I thought they were here; apparently not) that complained about the internal spring (which my girlfriend found very fatiguing, btw) rusting out and breaking: well, mine rusted out and broke yesterday. As a result, the blades don't meet tightly any more, so the shears won't cut anything. I've only had them for four months and they're useless."
1,Do not buy!,"Lasted 2 months and internal spring broke. They look good, feel good but the quality is NOT there. Sure I could send them back to be replaced but I'd just end up with another pair and they aren't worth the postage! I have some great old Henckels shears that are 35+ years old but these new ones were made in China.... ugh!"
4,Great live album by an underrated artist!,"I already own ""Spirit Of Music"", produced by Don Was, which is a great CD. Then this comes along. Great performances by Ziggy & the Melody makers and good live adaptaions of his and his father's songs. I really enjoy ""Beautiful Day"" and ""Jammin'"". ""I Know You Don't Care About Me"" has some very powerful lyrics as well. I know some people complain Ziggy isn't an exact copy of his father when it comes to writing songs, but why should he be? Most of his songs stand up just fine on their own. Get this CD, listen to it and find that inner peace!"
3,Okay for the price.,"I purchased this fridge only because it was an extreme sale item at Best Buy. It's 'fine'. But, if I had to do it over again, I'd probably spend another few hundred dollars to get a nicer model. It scratches VERY easily and is a bit loud for a newer refrigerator. Meh... it's just okay."
2,"Good, but The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook is much better.",It helps you understand why you feel the way you do and how to think and feel better.
1,Lol crap broke in a matter of days.,I want a replacement but don't have the product to return because I threw it out when it broke. I hope I can get a new one then I'll change my review. Good for A battle.
1,horrible,"this gun broke withen the first 100 shots. the gas seal broke and is now uselessPROSnoneCONSshipping took 2 1/2 weekstitle said black, but it arived silverhas maybe 125 FpSwhile it worked the gas chamber didnt hold much"
3,Buy it if you like autmatics and loading it,The gun has a okay range of fire and is an automatic but only can shoot 10 bullets then you will have to reload
2,dissapointed,"I bought it based on a recommendation from a friend and was expecting a modern day Nina Simone or the like. Sorely dissapointed. She has a good voice but not that much personality. The arrangements border on elevator muzak grade. Her pale interpretation of classic tunes is also tame, uninspired. The Tom Waits covers in particular lack almost everything that made the originals so gritty & great. Not recommended."
3,"Late, sluggish Bernstein","Bernstein had his say in this song cycle in NY with Christa Ludwig and Walter Berry in top form. This DG remake some years later finds Andreas Schmidt in gorgeous voice, and he does the best job with Bernstein's tempi, now eccentrically slow by any measure. Lucia Popp's lyric-colorature soprano had darkened with age, and she sounds too mature and vocally unsure much of the time, wonderful artist though she is.Ultimately this is Bernstein's show, and if you don't mind things being taken like molasses in winter, not to mention the accomanying attempt to overblow each song emotionally, there are good things to hear on this CD. These are all exceptional artists, after all."
3,Good Read,"Good read for those wanting some insight into New Orleans hip-hop. Although the point is illustrate the current New Orleans hip-hop milieu, some historical perspective is needed. Because of this, it is not a good source for the music scholar but fans will enjoy."
3,Container Gardener by #,"I did not order this book, however it was shipped to me. I have ordered at Amazon before and never had this trouble. I tried to order P. Allen Smith;s Container Gardening which I thought I wasn't going to receive but finally did. There was no order, price, etc. very unusual. I do like the book that you sent. I am afraid to order more books from you, another book was charged to me and I had never heard of that book. that one I cancelled, because you said you were sending it to me. What gives.Carole Robbins"
4,Menus for Impulsive Living,I read this book many years ago. Just recently I have picked it up and have been applying the principles in it. I believe that they are true and am starting to see that being conscious of them can lead to a more fulfilled life.
1,Huh?,"This book is THE WORST! And yes I Know that some Authors Goof up sometimes but I have read Victoria:May blossom of Britannia,and the Juliet books to know That a.k.a Anna Kirwan kinos Juliet was OK but Victoria was like Lady of Palenque And this one is The Worst of the Worst! the info has good Just one thing THE PLOT WAS SOOOOO BAD!!!! I have read 136 pages out of this book but I think that what I read in this book is so bad!"
4,It was good,"Lady of Palenque: Flower of Bacal is about Princess ShahnaK'in Yaxchel (Princess Green Jay on the Wall. She is a Mayan princess of the city of Lakamha (Palenque) and is betrothed to the Sun Eyed King Fire Keeper of Xuipi (Copan). The diary is an account of her journey through Mesoamerican Mexico to Honduras in a journey that takes months. She faces hardships of all kinds until she finally meets her husband.I give it a four because it was really detailed, but like most of Anna Kirwan's Royal Diaries, it was a bit boring and hard to follow. It would have been better if it had more action and intriuge. Princess Green Jay on the Wall's life, however, was really detailed and accurate."
3,Give It A Chance Folks!!!,"Ok, the story was not the best of the Royal diaries I've ever read, but it wasn't horrible. I got it from the library, read it and ok, a few of the names are confusing. Big deal. I got through it and I would definitely read it again. As to the ""stupidity of the names"" as they've been called, hey, let's face it, that's what they named people in 749 A.D. For that matter, read Indian names dating 1500's.It took me a couple of times to totally get the whole point, but after a few times through it, I picked up on things that I didn't the first time.Give it a chance!!!"
3,Lady of Palenque-Flower of Bacal,"This is such a typical book.I was quite astounded at the quality of this book compared to the quality of the other books in the series.The only book which i have liked less than this is Nzingha-Warrior Queen of Matamba.This book is about a very boring princess who lives in a faraway Mayan area in A.D 749.I am definite that i have wasted my precious time reading a book of such bad quality.This book is nearly all about her travels,it is so boring.It is hard to interact with the characters or even know the characters because there are too many characters.The front cover looks interesting but the book is really boring.I suggest you read a different royal diary book insteaD.[Look at my reviews] This book should be banished from the Royal Diaries.It is very boring and rambles on and on and on.I couldn't even finnish the book.That is the first Royal Diary book I couldn't finnish."
1,DO NOT USE!,My horse broke out with sores everywhere the product touched him. Do not use unless you want an expensive vet bill. This sould be taken off the market. I now only use herbal fly spray. DO NOT USE!
1,expensive reaction,"My horse developed moderate swelling in both front tendons within 36 hours of application. He also became mildly lame, stiff, and spent 4 days sleeping flat on the ground for up to 5 hours a day. I washed his legs well once I realized what had happened on the second day. Now it is 10 days later, he is still just barely lame, and I have the vet coming tomorrow to try to help get rid of the residual swelling, he also still has heat on both front legs. It is going to cost me over $200 to hopefully fix this mistake. I would never use this again. I even tested a small amount on his back several days before the main application as they recommend and noticed no reaction there. I hope my horses tendons are not permenantly damaged. I am worried that 10 days out he is still sore."
1,My horse is very sick after using this product,"After a couple days my horse is very ill, lethargic off feed etc. Though it may work for some horses, I'll never use it for any other horse again because of the risk. This product should be taken off the shelves"
4,napoleons Cuirassiers,"This is my second copy, first original is worn from use, so Iordered a used second, not a reprint,on reprint color on plates are lost, Great for history buff or reanactor ."
5,A must-read for Great Northern Railroad fans,"A comprehensive history of the Great Northern Railroad. A ""loving"" tribute to a truly great railroad which never fell into receivership like many of the other large roads (such as the Pennsylvania and New York Central). Included are hundreds of photos and memorabilia. If you're a fan of the Great Northern, or even railroads in general, you'll love this book...if you can find it! It is currently out-of-print"
5,terrific,This is the a prototype for all other historical railroad books combining a fairly comprehensive selection of high quality photographs and well written informative text. Certainly a must for anyone interested in the Great Northern Railway.
3,Good Value,"This frame has a good quality screen and is easy to use. Don't resize pics like others are saying. I tried it side by side and it's no contest unless you like loosing the sharp high res pics that this frame can display.I put a bit over 200 pics each in two folders on a 1GB card and the frame had no problem switching to the second folder once it had run through the first.I found the overall look pretty dull and boring with either color frame. To fix, I polished the black outer frame to a gloss finish and made a white mat to fit between the parts. It looks really nice now."
3,Good Product: poor instructions,"The Matsunichi Photoblitz 8"" Digital Photo Picture Frame performed as expected. It is feature laden with good color rendition. It set up quickly out of the box, but then this isn't my first digital picture frame. The 280 image limitation can be overcome by putting several folders with less than 280 images in each on the SD card.The disappointing feature of this device is the very poorly written instruction manual. So many of the features are so difficult to set up that it renders this item usefullness as ""Limited."""
4,a great pleasure,"I was satisfied by the quality of the pics and the sound. It is nice to be able to change the frame and it is of real wood. NO memory inside, though plug and play was simple even for mother in law who is not familiar with the computers. Overall a good present with a reasonable price compared to the equivalents in the market."
2,So - so,"Well the frame does what it is supposed to do - it shows pictures. Also, the frame is actual wood and pretty good looking.Now for the bad part. Overall this frame feels 'cheap', and the picture is neither bright nor sharp enough. The menus are counterintuitive and difficult to navigate around.The biggest minus of this frame is the fact that the AC power cord keeps loosing contact, causing the frame to turn off.All in all, I am sure that there are better products out there."
4,Frame Review,"My only complaint is the fact that it doesn't have a USB port. I had to buy a component that would plug into my computer's USB port and transfer files onto the SD card. It cost me $15 and I'm sure I'll use it for other things later on, but it was an extra cost and a bit of an inconvenience."
4,Very nice digital frame,"Nice digital frame with high resolution, the picture looked a little washed out at factory settings but after adjustiing looked very good.I purchased two and am very happy with them."
2,Choose a different frame.,"This frame is difficult to use. Menu's are confusing, the manual is horribly incomplete. It, too, is confusing.The angle of view is too narrow, i.e. the picture display disappears at even a moderate angle.The CF slot is 'sloppy' making it difficult to properly seat the card. The mini-power cord is so loose that it frequently works loose and shuts off the frame.This a very poorly designed product.NOT RECOMMENDED!"
2,Don't waste your money...,"Of all the screenwriting-focused books I've purchased in the last several months, this is without question the least useful and most annoying.This book is essentially a compilation of bulletin-board conversations that occurred during the early 1990s between the author and some fellow writers. Aside from the fact that it gave me very little useful information, two things made the book almost unbearable -- first, she writes in a stream-of-consciousness style that's terribly difficult to follow and second, she's a constant user of sentence fragments. I found myself wishing someone would drag fingernails down a blackboard to relieve the pain.Gilles, Hunter, Lerch, and about a zillion others are all better reads and much more useful."
4,Acts of faith,"It starts off slowly but builds up to a great ending. Terrific cast, deceptively charming performances. The movie works.People helping people; how can that not work."
5,Great work,Quite impressive movie with a great and true message delivered by amazing acting. Jason Segel is the best! You will love this movie unless you're looking for a 3D action flick!
2,Jeff Who Lives At Home,It was not that great of a film. It moved slowly and the characters did not show many redeeming qualities until the very end of the movie. There are many better films to spend two hours watching.
3,"Good story, bad language","I liked the story, and the characters were real and believable. There was foul language, too much. That never makes a movie better in my opinion. Good ending."
2,Loved it TILL!,Great Movie till.... Susan Sarandon gets sexually confused and kisses her coworker? It was sad that they ruined an otherwise entertaining movie.
4,sweet movie,"I liked this movie more than I thought I would. Sweet, simple story about ordinary people trying to figure themselves out. I was expecting a comedy and although there where a couple of funny scenes, it was definitely drama."
3,Jeff who lives at home,"Great cast, awesome dialog, fantastic plot... TERRIBLE filming. The camera jumps CONSTANTLY and the viewer can't focus on the movie. The opening scene with the brother and his wife goes back and forth, back and forth, disorientating... gave me headache. Sometimes less is more..."
4,"nice, slow movie","It's slow, but I like this kind of cinema. Ed and Jason are both fantastic actors, especially Jason. The mom's storyline seemed to be forced into the plot, but overall, a nice movie."
4,Pleasant surprise,"My wife and I selected this as it was free through Amazon Prime and were very pleasantly surprised with this little cinematic gem. The plot line, while simple enough in concept, unfolds slowly but all the sweeter for it in the end. Thoughtful and well acted it was a welcome change of pace. Well worth a watch."
4,Excellent example of the genre,"This is the quintessential indie-style heart warmer. It's not a masterpiece by any means. Segal plays a version of himself as usual and Helms plays a manic jerk instead of a manic loser. There may be nothing new here, but there is much to like. A fantastical tale of destiny with a happy ending? I'll take two, please. The film owes a serious debt to Hal Harley's Trust."
1,"Bad story, stupid result",The characters and the story were stupid. It seemed like the story was written by my seven year old daughter.
1,worse movie I have ever seen,"Stupid, very slow, hardly any plot. I really was disappointed in this movie !!! I had heard it was okay from some people and knowing the plot about the guy living at home, I thought it would be funny and enjoyable. Not so--big let down for me."
3,"Strange, but Good","I streamed this video through Amazon on my Vizio television. This movie was odd, not typical for these actors, but good. It takes place in ""Baton Rouge"" throughout the day in the life of Jeff, his brother, and his mother. It's worth a watch, but not necessarily a purchase. If you are a New Orleans/Baton Rouge resident, you'll have fun laughing about all the location inaccuracies."
4,Unexpected pleasure,Well written comedy with some dramatic elements. Excellent cast amd well paced. Great to see Susan Sarandon and Rae Dawn Chong. Recommended.
2,Sort of glad I stuck it out,Took forever to not be depressing. Almost turned it off but the acting was holding it together. Thankfully no one died.
