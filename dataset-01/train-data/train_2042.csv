1,awful album!,"I didn't find this good at all. There seems to be people trying to decieve me, but the 4 star average proves that not everybody was satisfied with album, and i'm not one of them, what a waste of money."
1,Whooh shes awful,"She thinks shes all awesome just because Simon raved about her. She'll never top Kelly Clarkson. Kelly is the best Idol YET! That's for sure... GO KELLY! This CD stinks because every song sounds the same, she does too many corny ballads, and she isn't even good at them. Independence Day made me puke."
1,ugly music! the only decent song,"is jesus take teh wheel. the rest stink. people shoudl get their ears checked for buying this album, they're obviously only buying it for her looks, shes ugly. anyway, don't buy this unless you like crappy music."
5,whooh she's awesome!!!,"Shes all awesome just because Simon raved about her!!! She'll surely top Kelly Clarkson. Kelly is the best Idol YET, but not for long, that's for sure... GO CARRIE! This CD is awesome because every song amazing, she does many great ballads and fast paced songs! I still LOVE Kelly, but CARRIE is going to be better!"
5,Jesus Take the Wheel is an amazing song!,"Has anybody seen her video for Jesus, Take the Wheel? I saw it on CMT the other night. Best video directing and acting/singing I've seen in years. It takes a bunch of people in unfortunate circumstances and sticks them in clips with Carrie singing. She is a true artist! Another great piece of artistry to add to any country lovers collection!!!"
3,A couple good tracks...,"Carrie is strongest on her first single, ""Jesus Take the Wheel."" Well done, excellent choice of song which shows off her voice.BUT AMAZON (MS. NASH), WHY DID YOU FIND IT NECESSARY TO TRASH BO BICE IN A CARRIE REVIEW? Do you trash the Stones in a Beatles review? Are you looking to alienate Bo fans so they buy Bo's CD at Barnes & Noble or Wal-Mart? I've already preordered my Bo CD here, perhaps I should cancel the order and look elsewhere. Totally unprofessional."
5,Awesome songs from the newest American Idol Star,"Carrie's new CD is as awesome as I expected. I wish her all the best in her career. If all her songs are this good, she will continue to rise to the top."
5,CW!!! Can't Wait!!! CW!!! Carrie Underwood!!!,Carrie has amazing vocals and true sense of musicality. Luckily Independence Day is not in here..coz im sick of that song..haha!
1,No Talent,"She is horrible! I cannot stand her high pitched annoying voice. She ruined the songs, waste of recording space in my opinion. She can't even dance. Look at her prancing around like a happy little fish in an old field. She doesn't deserve the time of day. Wasted, Dont forget to remember me , Some hearts, Jesus take the wheel, The night before, Whenever you Remember are all poorly sung by her. All good songs... all poorly sung. Its a shame."
1,"Don't be fooled, she has no talent!!","Kelly Clarkson is the only true winner of American Idol, everyone else from the show stinks! EVERYONE! This CD is so boring she sounds the same on every song, Go back to Checotah little girl you can't sing!"
1,She just doesn't cut it.,"I'm sorry Carrie Underwood, but you just don't cut it as far as decent music goes. Your album is the ipitimy if mediocre. I hope that she tries harder on her next album."
1,She is an awful artist!,"I hate this disgusting music! Every song sounds the same and she needs to stop singing, it just isn't what she's meant to do. Get a life Carrie."
5,Das beste Album vom Jahr,"Wunderbar! Carrie hat ein brillantes gro√ües Album gemacht. Ich habe die Musik geliebt und habe gehofft, dass Sie Deutschland eines Tages bereisen. Sie werden von der ganzen Welt geliebt!"
5,Very good album..,I love this album very much! My favourite song is Before He Cheats and Jesus Take The Wheel..the rest rocks too..
5,Bravo!,What a fantastic cd...it has wonderful vocals and heart felt songs! Carrie sounds wonderful...what more can you ask her.Bravo!
1,As Lackluster as Her Personality,"Simon Fuller's team must be buying up truckloads of this CD for it to be selling as much as it is.................they'll do anything to prove their point, which is that this girl needs those types of devices to sell her music. It will never do it on it's own. There is nothing behind her voice, it's the same empty head we witnessed throughout the competition. What a shame."
2,Good job!!!,I think Carrie Underwood sings pretty on some songs but on others she sounds kind of yucky. I try to stay open to a lot of artists. She's okay for a country artist~Rosita
1,"Another ""cookie-cutter ""singer...","Carrie Underwood sounds just like all the other good singers out there, but there's just nothing special here that stands out to me. It's as though the music industry has a big cookie cutter that they use to just produce the exact same sound and talent. Geez, can we get something new, nice and different for a change? Carrie just does nothing for me - same old thing."
1,Too rushed!,"I know American Idol tries to get these cds out in a hurry but that is not necessarily a good thing. I like her voice, it sounds a lot better than it did on the show. That's why I gave a star. The songs stink, too much alike. I'm just telling it like it is. This is a filler cd. You have Idol to thank for that. Rush jobs hardly ever create great art. Good luck to Carrie Underwood and her nice voice. I hope she gets another chance at a cd.I hope the only release from this album is ""Jesus takes the wheel"". That might be less damaging than releasing songs that sound too much alike. Next time allow her to showcase her voice more."
1,shes average.,"what amazes me in this album is her inability to use country as her genre, but combines a bit of pop in the songs. totally am irked by her voice, there's no doubt about that. yet i feel like the album still has something. probably because i'm not really a fan of country music. but hey, she's still good at it. because of that, kudos to carrie for making a cruddy country album!"
1,Big Disappointment,"I liked her on the show, but I really don't like this album. It's really not that good. Too many song's that sound the same to me."
1,1 star ...,This album is terrible. I saw her on the CMA's and on Jay Leno and she sang like a barbie doll. She barely even opened her mouth and one some parts she lypsynched. This CD isn't even close to being good. Especially the chorus's of the songs.
1,Needed to be more country,There are only a couple of really good country songs on here. This sounds like a cross between Hilary Duff and Ashley Simpson.
1,ugly voice,"her voice is ugly. Unless you like getting your ears ripped out of your head by an ugly voice, I wouldn't recommend buying this.~Shana."
1,Don't waste your money,"I watched American Idol faithfully last year and was in awe of Carrie's amazing voice. It was a no-brainer that she would win and I couldn't wait until she put out an album. When her single ""Inside Your Heaven"" was released, I played it hundreds of times & enjoyed every minute of it. But with the exception of one song on this album ""Jesus Take the Wheel"" her voice is wimpy and her songs uninspiring and insipid. Carrie, Carrie - where is the power, enthusiasm, and special spark you had on Idol? It's not in this album."
1,LIARS! GIVE ME A BREAK,"Oh come on, SCOTT? There is obviously somebody creating multiple accounts, and once I found out who it is, i'm going to cut off their internet access, because i know how. Anyway, this cd is awful! So beware buying it, it might shatter your eardrums and you might also die of her ugliness*ROC"
2,She's overrated... AI SUCKS,"I don't get this, AI sucks, nobody was any good last season. This CD is so boring, she will fade away into a nothing because she is afraid when shes unstage she looks like a dear in headlights. She can't sing worth crap she has no range, no control. She has ugly bulging teeth and bleach blonde hair that isn't attractive. She should just pack herself away, theres nothing to make her stand out. Her single 'Jesus take the wheel' pretty much flopped on radio because her video was the worst music video put out by anybody in a LONG time. Anybody who saw it knows that. That's a pretty good sign of whats to come from Carrie, more mediocrity. Waste of my hard earned money."
1,I hate it! Every song sounds the same...,"Carrie should just be a drone because we all know she is SO different and her voice is just revolutionary for a country singer. lets just hug her till she dies we just have so much love for her scrawny wretched voice. I don't feel good about this cd, i don't feel anything about this cd other than hate. all she does is complain in this horrible cd."
1,BAD!,"Sorry to say this but this album is really bad... it has nothing new to it.Carrie is an amazing vocalist but this album do no justice.The only good track is ""Jesus, take the wheel"", the rest are just noise... nothing original. Most songs sound like soap-opera theme songs.This album is just boring."
1,Terrible Debut!!,"This is a horrible CD! Carrie shows that she truly is an American Loser. All of the music on it is painful to listen to and there are many bad songs. Her current single, ""Jesus, Take the Wheel"" is pathetic. The upbeat songs are my least favorite but the slow songs show off her inability to think and unoriginality. I am sure this CD will be a great flop and truly become the worst selling American Idol albums ever!"
1,Just plain horrible~!,"I was so upset when I heard Jesus, Take the WHeel on the radio. This is such a bad song, it makes me cry. The rest of the music on the album isn't much better, she should not be singing."
1,really bad ; my time wasted,"wow.. what a great song.. not. Such recycled trash, she's a shame to country music, we don't want her. Her ugly pointy face makes me sick, she needs to get a life and sotp singing."
2,Disappointing,"This album is like Carrie - sweet, innocent and completely with substance. If you like fluffy, light country-pop, you'll love this, but if you're looking for the future of country music, I'd say look elsewhere."
5,Great CD!,"I really like this CD. Carrie Underwood has an amazing voice that sounds great, and I love the words to alot of her songs. I would definately reccomend this CD."
5,great first cd by Carrie,this is a great cd........not a cd with only one good song but all of the songs are really good.
3,"Pretty voice, no staying power","The music comes and goes for a while, you may want to listen to it, or have an urge to listen to it. But after a while it will collect dust on your cd rack. It just isn't one of those albums that you can listen to 1000 times and still love and enjoy the same way. Very few albums have that durability. However, I will credit Carrie 3 stars because the CD is, technically, vocally mastered and flawless. It isn't the content, its moreover the durability of the song production, and well, Carrie's voice. She needs to add more of herself into it. Overall, nice music for any country fan. I'm not going to lie, you will get tired of it eventually."
5,Carrie rocks!,"Here's my rating for each and every song!Wasted=8/10Don't Forget To Remember Me=8/10Some Hearts=8/10Jesus, Take The Wheel=9/10The Night Before=7/10Lessons Learned=8/10Before He Cheats=10/10Starts With Goodbye=10/10I Just Can't Live A Lie=10/10We're Young And Beautiful=8/10That's Where It Is=6/10Whenever You Remember=7/10I Ain't In Checotah Anymore=8/10Inside Your Heaven=10/10"
1,She will be a nobody by mid 2006,"Everyone will be saying 'Carrie -who?' by next year. This girl has nothing of the 'it' factor. She infact has nothing going for her other than her quite average looks. She's just a horribly boring southern belle. Wow, wasted is the worst song i've heard in my lfie! Please stop singing Carrie!"
1,Carrie Underwood sucks,"what? Another country artist... shes just another blonde. We have enough blondes in country. She can just hop on the bandwagon with the other 50000 who can sing just like her. Bye bye! Wasted is the only good song on the cd, the rest stink. Including her single ""Jesus, Take the Wheel"" thats no good at all!"
1,Reminds me of Shania Twain's first album...,"hers flopped as well. It was also full of terrible songs, but look how big she is now. Shania just needed a boost, and to get her own style. Carrie definately needs her own style, she might need help in getting it too, probably because she doesn't feel any emotion. Or she hides it inside her, it just doesn't work Carrie. Pretty singing is becoming obsolete. People want something different and styleish. Thats why the most popular artists may not have the most incredible voices ever, but they offer passion and strength in what they do. Something that you seem to be critically lacking. Better luck on your next release, which I won't be purchasingScotia."
1,Carrie Underwood < Ruben Studdard < Fantasia < Kelly Clarkson,"Carrie Underwood's debut album is the WORST idol debut of them all. I thought that Ruben's was bad. Well it was, but not nearly as bad as Carrie's. She doesn't sing well because she never harnesses a song and takes it for what it is. All she does is sing it pretty, well let me let you in on something, pretty means nothing without a meaning. Whitney Houston could yell all she wanted too but it wouldn't mean a thing if she didn't put herself into what she sings. You've got quite a few lessons to learn little girl. Until you do, you won't have any worth in this industry."
2,Carrie Underwood sings in Some Hearts - my review:,"Pros Some Song Variety - Country with some pop mixed inUnderwood's Vocal Range - Can hit the high notes with the best of themDepth of Instrumental - Piano, guitars, strings... It has it allCons It is a Country Album - This is only a con if you're looking for a LOT of variety.Less than Incredible Tracks - Like all CDs, this one has a couple songs that won't wow you.Substance - Some would say she doesn't move much beyond her AI image her. But is that bad?"
2,Its good!!!,"First, brutal honesty. I live here and don't like country music. I know, I know. Nonetheless, I was rooting for Carrie Underwood on American Idol. She's sweet, pretty and an Oklahoma native. What else could you want?Her debut is good, and I highly recommend it. If you don't like country, you'll still enjoy this. But there's no doubt she is a country singer, and she doesn't go much beyond her Idol image. That won her the crown, though, so it's probably a wise move for the first album."
3,Carrie Underwood CD,"It's o.k., but after the first few songs, you kinda tune her out and you feel like it's one REALLY long song. Looking forward to American Idol starting again this week!"
1,"Not as bad as everyone says, still not worthy","Still only gets 1 star from me, no matter how good everyone says it is. I am just saying my honest opinion, that it doesn't deserve anything better than 1 star."
1,really dissapointed with Carrie,"As most of the reviews on this album reveal, she has little emotional understanding of the events and lifechanging situations in which she sings about so openly. I hope for her sake that she keeps trying."
1,pathetic artist!!!,"Inside your heaven is the only song on this album worth listening too! She needs to help herself by singing with more passion. it's her own fault. I just wish that she would see that is is a beautiful girl. If only she would sing every song like she sings 'Jesus Take the Wheel' then we'd have something! The other ones are just dreadful, and it isn't my fault that she put out a bad album, and its my prerogative to write this review that her album is awful!"
2,carrie,didnt care for it as much as other idol albums (chris doughtery is the best so far) not as bad as kelly pickler (now perky pickler) but if you like carrie in idol you sure will like her here. resold my copy
1,Disregard the 5 star reviews..,"I find it interesting that people have inflicted such lies about this CD. It is not a good cd, it doesn't not have a good production crew, and the lyrical selection is even worse. I would suggest turning away now."
1,She really isn't very good...,"I never enjoyed her single and I hated her album! Yuck, just not worth it. Save your money for something else..."
1,her five minutes of fame are over,"Carrie, please stop trying to nudge yourself into country. You are an amateur and country doesn't need it. I've given you a fair chance, and you are just another one of those singers who fades in the backround and never seems to come back out. It's because you just aren't talented enough to make a dent in the industry. It has nothing to do with you personally, just your singing ability. This CD has more ballads than it does hits. Of course, its hard to relate to any of these songs because of their limited circumstance."
1,Carrie Underwood,"Carrie Underwood Stinks! I don't like this CD at all, she needs to work on her vocals."
5,Some Hearts,This is a nice collection of Carrie Underwood's songs. I thorougly enjoy this abum. Carrie has her own sound and this is a nice collection of that sound.
5,Carrie Underwood,Well done Carrie! Very good album for a new artiste's effort..now i know the reason why you win..btw..i heard you sell more records than Kelly Clarkson's Breakaway on news..good job!!!
1,HORRIBLE,"Unoriginal, very non-compelling music. I recently purchased this CD and wish I didn't. I expected better, but it seems like she's a puppet to a larger corporate system. The music has NO appeal and has nothing to distinguish itself from other bland music.I am so disappointed in today's music. No thought, no compassion... this is a prime example. Do not buy!"
1,Bubblegum is all she can do....,"Its true, the whole thing is bubblegum. It takes practically not alent to do bubblegum, and thats all she can do, therefore, it isn't impressive and its just flat out bad. She sucks even at her best genre, country. Thats gotta hurt..."
1,Where do people get off saying its a Great CD????????,This cd is not great to say the least.... She sounds the same throughout the album and is squelling in a high pitched horror.. Please people tell the truth she is a one star singer and will be gone as fast as you say Carrie..
1,She's no Idol,"Blonde generic very dull, can't compete with the likes of the people who she tries to imitate because she has no personality or drive. She doesn't need music. She uses it. There has only been one American Idol and that is Kelly. Look at the awesome success Breakaway is having and Carrie thinks she can duplicate that, but she can't because she can't even measure up to Kelly on any of her music. There is not one truly good song on this cd. I'm really upset because my grandmother decided to get me this because she likes boring sappy music. I thought she would know better. I love rock and I love Kelly. Of course, I already have Breakaway. But I'd rather have 10 copies of the same thing than Carrie's which I gave to my dog to play with."
1,psycho chick,"wow this girl has issues, going crazy cuz she was cheated on. this would not only get her arrested for what she talks about but also sued for the damages that she caused. good job, nice role model for all the little girls who look up to her. but, apparently she doesn't really care. good role model."
1,Some Hearts is a sure flop!,"I got this CD on Tuesday. It's terrible. I played it once, and I'm going to return it to the store by Tuesday. Once people hear her jittery voice and these poorly written songsas. I haven't been this horrified by a singer in a long time. She is the most run-in the mill singer i've heard in ages. This girl is headed for the biggest flop in history, against Madonna pschh please. Each song on this CD is worse than the last one, and the first one ain't good. I can't even pick a worst. They're all just awful. Anyone who buys this will be disappointed, that I can guarantee you, whether they're fans of country music or not. It is one sided. I see some good reviews on here. The only thing I can say is, why don't you really tell the truth, and say how bad this cd truly is."
1,Another CD from a mediocre artist...,"I don't believe most of these reviews. All I know is this is a mediocre album. Ther isn't much that seperates it from the croud. Except maybe one song, that being, Jesus, Take the Wheel. Its a typical AI follow up cd."
1,She has a black soul.... I hate this CD it makes me depressed,"I thought she was supposed to sing country, by definition the music of the lord. She minus well sing hard metal because her lyrics are depressing and forlorn. They make me cry and make me depressed. I really dislike the way she does this so very harshly. It hurts an old hag like my heart. Hopefully I will feel better once I return it to the store..Mary Lue Finnius."
5,Very impressive,"Carrie has the chance to be the best and most successful singer that American Idol has produced. She has a very versitile voice and she's good at fast or slow songs. Sure country is where she's probably most comfortable but she can do a variety of songs that suit her really well. I love the songs on here and if you are negative about this cd because she is an American Idol winner, then try and put that out of your head and go buy this. You won't be disappointed. All songs on here are fantastic and especially Inside Your Heaven. That is always going to be her song. Great debut."
5,Carrie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I am Melissa. I think she did a very good work. All tracks are very very nice. Powerful vocals. WoW!
5,She has a beautiful voice.,"Everything about her seems beatiful.Wasted-->Vocally brilliant.Don't Forget To Remember Me-->Lyrically brilliant. She sung it with so much emotions.Some Hearts-->Title track! Never wrong.Jesus, Take The Wheel-->She connected so well with the song.The Night Before-->Totally boring! But still she sung it. A piece of safe but beautiful song.Lessons Learned-->Great! Both vocally and lyrically!Before He Cheats-->Hoping more of this kind in her future albums. She sung it once again!Starts With Goodbye-->Nice. Very nice. Easily my favourite.I Just Can't Live A Lie-->I almost cry during this song. It's so beautifully sung.We're Young And Beautiful--> So cute! Abit oversung though.That's Where It Is-->Great vocals!Whenever You Remember-->Lyrics wise not good. Otherwise it'll be my favourite.I Ain't In Checotah Anymore-->Vocally brilliant once more!Inside Your Heaven-->My favourite!***One last complaint-->Angels Brought Me Here isn't inside!"
5,WOW!!!!!!! FANTASTIC DEBUT,"This is by far the best Idol debut ever. Carrie has such a style that is not typical for Idol, and continues that through the debut album. If you liked Carrie on Idol, you will not be disappointed in the album. Every song she sings fits her so well. Carrie is destined to become the next Martina McBride or Trisha Yearwood. Her tone and pitch are perfect. Her song selection fantastic. Overall the album is a must have for any idol or country fan."
5,Sounds really like a greatest hits album!,"If you dunno who Carrie Underwood is, you will mistaken and thought that she has been doing this for years. She's a real pro with her vocals and all the songs are just like a hit. No filler tracks at all!"
5,COOL COUNTRY CARRIE,Carrie Underwood is a talented singer with a bright future ahead of her. The CD gives listeners a glimpse of what to expect in the future from the newest star on the music scene. Every song is a great song. I think this country tune is perfect for Carrie's powerful voice. Carrie makes up for it by displaying her incredible vocal range on every song. She sounds great on every track in my opinion.I love it. I have been playing her cd non stop today. And the same will goes to tomorrow..and the day after..and the day after..and the.........
5,A star is born!,"This is one of the best CD's out today. I followed Carrie Underwood all through the auditions on American Idol and all the way to the finale, where she beat out Bo Bice for the 2005 crown.Carrie's first album, ""Some Hearts"", is full of songs about love and loss, and learning lessons in life... there is a lot of variety here... from the Gospel-tinged ""Jesus, Take The Wheel"" to the rebellion of ""Before He Cheats""... there are lots of potential singles on this CD.Carrie and her producers and songwriters have created a wonderful CD. I suggest you not only but it for yourself, but get some as Christmas gifts too!!!"
5,"Wonderful, Every Song is Amazing","Wow! I knew her Cd was going to be good, but this was really amazing. She has such a clear and beautiful voice, and you really feel how into the songs she is. She is really great, this is a wonderful start to her career! If all of her Cds are this good, she will definitely be big! I absolutely love her, and I think everyone should buy this Cd, you don't have to like country music to enjoy it, anyone will enjoy this Cd!"
1,"Wasted, Jesus, Take the Wheel, The Night Before","The best songs EVAR! Just kidding, they're actually the worst songs on the album. In fact, she needs to get some voice lessons, her voice cracked about 5 times on this CD. Every song sounds the same, if you actually liked this girl you would tell the truth and let her know that she stinks. You are being decieved by rabid Carrie fans."
1,She fails!,"She'll never be good enough! I don't think that she can ever be good enough after the profound dissapointment from her last album. please keep me updated with her latest releases. Anyway, she should've tried harder. most artists are judged on their debut album and she just acts as if its nothing else! She just complains about how horrible her lif once was. Please, shes only 18 years old. Grow up little girl and stop complaining."
1,This album sucks!,"Wow, some loser is actually wasting their time rewriting other peoples reviews! Get a life you fing loser! Anyway, this CD sucks."
1,an original review by paris watkins,Carrie Underwood is a very mediocre singer and cannot sing out a solid country tune or even bring out any tune. GO FANTASIA!
1,"Sorry, not feeling it",On most of the songs she sounds pretty good until she goes for the power notes. At this point she almost always goes sharp and high. Sometimes to the point that it hurts my ears. I was really hoping the studio could clean that problem up for her.
3,In today's world of pop/country music - it's ok!,"I like Carrie, and I have no doubt she will have a great career. Most of the songs on the album fit in nicely with todays radio/tv format of country/pop. However, as a lover of music, it's not great - just ok. The best music (country or otherwise) comes from those artists who never make it onto the pop-country airwaves. Try some Steve Earle, Nickelcreek, Blue Highway, Lyle Lovett, Old Crow Medicine Show. Why music is so dumbed down nowdays is beyond me. But, take it as it is, Carrie has a great voice and personality to match. It's just not great music."
5,This CD is a GEM!,"As a fan of Americana, I really am not one who likes the changes Country music has seen over the past 10 years or so. The trend toward Country-Pop has been very intimidating to me as my old favorites become more and more dated. Faith Hill, Shania Twain and all the rest rule ""country"" these days. I blindly started making the same assumptions about Carrie Underwood, lumping her in with all of the other ""country-pop"" singers. I said on many other boards that she was a ""pop tart"" and that she was going to ruin and censor Country music.After finally actually listening to the CD this weekend though instead of blindly bashing it, I have done a complete 180 on Carrie. The CD is very good and the girl has an amazing vocal range. I'm really into ""Before He Cheats"". It sounds very much like old-school Country! Even the popish songs like ""Some Hearts"", ""Lessons Learned"" and ""I Just Can't Live A Lie"" are good.OK, you guys win! I'm impressed! My Carrie-bashing days are all but over."
4,very nice debut album,"there are some really good songs on this album like Don't Forget to remember me,Before He Cheats,Jesus take the wheel i would say if u haven't bought this cd u should give it a listen"
5,Great Debut!!!!,"I guess Carrie really stuck to her own roots doing what she is good at. I mean, every single song on this album just fits her very well. On the show, Carrie did not exactly show off what she really had. This album shows what she's really got!! GREAT GREAT DEBUT!!"
2,kelly clarkson is the real winner of all seasons and,"bo should've won! i voted for him all night, and he still didn't win. I was so angry and i shut the tv off as soon as he lost. I bought her album because i love country music most of the time but i hated this album.. its just too country. kellyc's cd is muchhh better.. starts with goodbye kind of sounds like where is your heart a little bit."
1,Will the evil ever stop?????,"I thought about listing a slew of albums and artists in this review that would put this kind of pre-manufactured junk to shame, but I realized that the people who listen to this krap actually WANT to listen to pre-manufactured junk - they want to sit in front of their TV, all the while avoiding things like quality art in the form of great movies on DVD, and watch shows like American Idol night after night, telling them exactly what pre-manufactured junk to buy. They don't care that there are interesting and creative artists aplenty out there for those willing to discover them - no, they want nothing but vacant bimbos who happen to have nothing but a good voice, singing over generic pabulum that they didn't write or produce. The only good thing to come out of the Carrie Underwood/Clay Aiken/Ashlee Simpson/Britney genre is the fact that their careers are over in less than a year. I, on the other hand, will continue to enjoy CD's that I still love after 5, 10 and 15 years."
1,horrible the majority of people know,"You little tykes can spam up a page can't you? Well I just would like to say that this cd is completely sub par. Jesus take the wheel is such a bunch of bolognia, she throws her cheesy conservative views on us, what a burden. She didn't even write any of this music, she CO wrote one song, how awful is that? All of these songs are typical, generic, boring, disgusting, ugly, gross, hideous, pathetic, simple, dumb, closed minded, however you want to say it. She doesn't impress me in the least, and the majority of people i've talked to have hated this album and gave it away. Everyone hates it and most of people hate her, nobody liked her at all since AI, and now a few people like her but they are just little teeny boppers. Anybody with sense knows this failure will be gone in a year or so, Carrie who? Get lost little girl, go back and milk a cow, the music industry doesn't need you."
1,Stop polluting the reviews with 5 stars!,You are lying! The only good song is I Just Cant Live a Lie! The rest are terrible. She needs a voice change. Kelly Clarksons Breakaway is much better!
1,This does not Rock.,"1 star is for ""Before he cheats"". Good song. Power driven. Heart felt. Lets give this Carrie a try. I went through every other track on this release and found nothing. No kick, no energy. I can't even play this while I'm driving, not for just one song. I need music that gets me going. All the songs are so mellow. I regret buying it and I was wrong trying to do what a few people are trying to talk me into doing and that is listening to country. This review is for any rocker out there who is even thinking about buying this CD. ""Some hearts"" just need to be left alone."
1,Jesus Take the Wheel is an awful song!,"Has anybody seen her video for Jesus, Take the Wheel? I saw it on CMT the other night. Worst video directing and acting/singing on her part i've seen in years. It just takes a bunch of people in unfortunate circumstances and sticks them in clips with Carrie singing. She isn't a true artist, she is a fake, a manufactured star. Just another piece of junk to add to any country lovers collection."
1,Where did her voice go? Kelly is better,"Kelly did amaing all though the show american idol, and her cd was fantastic and mature. Carrie did great on the show too but on this CD she sounds awful. She sould've done that song by Heart called Alone.. that was amazing the rest were really boring and slow songs. I hate this CD so much. She is an insult to all of the legendary country artists out their."
1,Carrie Underwood - Some Hearts - 1/5 stars,I'm sorry but this album gets 1/5 stars. Here are my reasons why:1) She doesn't sing with emotion2) She has gotten worse since American Idol about performing3) She sings all ballads4) Her songs get old really fast5) Terrible Production6) Terrible photography
1,Poor Job Carrie Underwood,"I am very dissapointed with this album, every song sounds very similar and she doesn't even try to make things better with her dull voice. ON every song she sings with the same , dry,passionless attitude."
3,Not the one i like,"I really dislike it. I don't even like it as much as Black Eyed Peas ""Monkey Business"" and I hate that album. She needs to work on singing music thats more different and more exciting. She's just a boring annoying person. Get some personality girl! I always liked Bo better on AI but I had to get this CD to add it to my collection. I have all of the idols and runner ups singles and albums. My favorites would be Bo Bice's Inside your Heaven/Vehicle and Kelly's Breakaway and Diana's Blue Skies"
1,Really shame worthy,"I'm sorry but this is just bland fake country. It sounds like bad pop if you ask me, it isn't catchy to start with, and it doesn't leave an impression on you. The songs get old very fast, beware. Anybody who isn't obsessed with Carrie gets tired of her, sorry the personality / soul isn't there. Grow some spirit, Carrie."
1,Not here to just bash Carrie.,"I'm not here to bash Carrie Underwood or her new album by any means. She, in a way, deserved to win American Idol by all means, and she has a beautiful voice. This album was just dissapointing, though. Her first single is the only really good track. Better luck for Carrie in the future, as she seems like a perfectly nice woman. She just needs her own style, like other reviewers have said. Though I do like her, if you were looking for a better American Idol effort, go for Kelly Clarkson's Breakaway album, which is definately an outstanding winner."
1,Overrated.,"I expected this CD to be at the very least good if not great. I was shocked at the poor ennunciation, over the top production work and cookie cutter song selection. Shouts out to whoever managed to herd the sheep with their top shelf marketing."
1,Average,All the marketing hype and money poured to promote this album. I wonder about all these reviews. How can anyone who enjoys good music (take the fact she won a contest) can say this album is more than average. My 11 year old loves Kelly Clarkson because her music is great and she performs with passion. She liked BO Bice on Idol and tried to like Underwood but she is not pleasing to a 35 year old or 11 year old. She will not be around much longer. Who writes these songs anyway???? They are TERRIBLE>
1,Carrie Underwood is terrible!!,Somebody keeps writing more and more 5 star reviews. Get a life and stop trying to decieve people! This album deserves 1 star because its boring and pathetic! Kelly Clarkson was the best Idol winner.
1,1 star reviews tell the truth!,"Yes, its all true, Carrie's album stinks, shes not going to succeed. Well maybe not all of it, she will have much success in country, but if placed in any other genre she would fail horribly. She is just too boring to succeed in anything else. I would suggest for her to get her act together personality wise. Wasted and The Night Before rock!"
1,Worst Country Album Ever,"Good job Carrie-I love the song's ""Some Hearts"" and ""Inside Your Heaven."" Great country tunes...NOT. Anyone thinking about buying this should consider a real country album like Gretchen Wilson-she doesn't sell out and sing pop song's on her album."
1,Terrible Music by a Terrible Artist,"1 star. She fails to impress me in any way. Her first single 'Jesus, Take the Wheel' is meant to be sung with power, and she fails to do that. She only sings with her poor vocal chords. Which fail to carry her beyond amateurism. I hope that she improves or else, she'll be taking the short road to failure."
1,Good For Insomnia,"This CD is boring. It was like I was listening to one long boring song. It wasn't funky, groovy, or mellow at all. Carrie Underwood has no personality and she's as interesting as oatmeal at the end of the month. I can't see her bringing anything new to the table at all. She's not going to be as big as Fantasia or Kelly. Carrie will fade into oblivion just like Reuben. Next!"
1,She sucks she sucks!,She sucks so badly she didnot need to win!I have listened to a friends cd and she realy sucks!
1,really bad,"I bought this CD because I bought a few other American Idol CD's and I thought they were good, it wasn't the case. This CD is full of loud, obnoxious songs that are provocative and disgusting. She is an obnoxious little girl. I wouldn't buy this for my daughter any day of the week."
1,Dont Forget to Remember Me is the only memorable song,"The rest sound VERY similar. Even fans have to admit that at first and even after a while they had trouble differenciating the songs. It's not easy, they all sound the same and they all mean similar things. It wasn't wise of her to choose ballads to sing."
3,Problems with the kit,"I have a 99 cougar and just installed a panasonic cd player in my car. I use to have a jvc installed before I bought the panasonic. There were a few problems with the kit when I had the jvc in (the bottom right corner would stick out just a little) but now that I have my panasonic in the whole thing doesn't fit. The whole dash kit just seems to be to big now, like the thing just magically grew or something. I don't know, maybe I just need to do a little bit of customizing to it or something but that's the only problem I have had with the kit."
2,"Informative, but..","Good look at the scene, some interesting remarks and trivia, but the section in the back that purports to be a psychedelic music buyer's guide is simply terrible. I mean, according to that part of the work, Santana is a horrible act, Cream are the most overrated band in history, The Doors were only good for the debut album, King Crimson is totally bad.. etc, etc...music is a subjective thing, true, but come on..."
2,"Informative, yet lack of skill in writing.","This book was pretty sufficient in that it gave quite an exploration of a wide variety of bands. Though the problem is that these authors are too cynical and too snooty to cover this in a full length book. When they are critical of a scene, they use big words but are then able to describe why."
3,Newk,"I took a chance with this one since it was very [spendy] and I was dissapointed. First the jewel case was damaged however I was anxious to see if it was a good investment. Wisely they started off with ""Rudie"" but I feel that after that the music quailty fell off dramiticly. I reminded me of Ali Campbell's release ""Big Love"" with ""Pay my Rent"" being so true to form then. This group has so much talent I wish they'd stick with thier own members. Maybe I just getting old but Rap was a spin off af Reggae I with it didn't have to come back to it."
3,The Bear's Revenge!,"This has to be one of the most unintentionally funny movies ever made! The fact that this film takes itself so seriously only adds fuel to the laughter. The ""nature takes revenge on mankind"" premise is nothing new, but seldom has it been done with such absurd dialogue, extreme over-acting and hysterical special effects. (the exploding sleeping bag scene is worth the price of admission!) It's claim to fame is inclusion in one of the Medved Brother's ""Golden Turkey Awards"" books from the '80's. The DVD itself is amazing. It's rare to see a forgotten film of this vintage in such pristine condition...the wide-screen transfer is simply beautiful! A must-see for fans of ""so bad it's good"" horror flicks."
2,Awful but rewatchable,"This gem from 1979 combines some really awful mutant bear effects with an environmental twist. It seems some big, bad paper mills have been polluting the upper Maine area for years, and now the effects of this pollution, such as giant tadpoles, inedible fish, and of course the monster bear, are all coming home. Indian tribes are complaining, too, and Robert Foxworth and his pregnant wife Talia Shire travel up there to make sense of the mess. John Frankenheimer had descended a long way down the ladder when this film came out, and despite its sheer awfulness, it is compulsively re-watchable."
4,SCARY!!!,"You want GORE, SUSPENSE, SHOCK?THIS IS THE MOVIE!!! If you are a camper and see this movie I seriously doubt if you will EVER go CAMPING AGAIN!!! This movie is NOT for the faint of heart or weak of stomach! You want a rollercoaster ride?Strap yourself in and watch this video!A MUST for collectors of Horror! If you like this movie youll like Deadly Spawn,Alligator, Humanoids from the Deep, Phantasm, Food of the Gods,Wolfen, The Blob (new), The Thing (New)Scanners, The Being, and of course Creepshow!"
2,Just kill the confounded bear already!!,"Ahh, yet another B-rated monster movie. Just like many others of its kind, it sucks. While it had its scary moments, I looked to it more to be a movie where you sit down with some friends and poke fun at the funny parts (i.e. the bear throwing the old man around, the part where the bear hit the kid in the sleeping bad and he flew at about 500 mi/hr into a rock, etc.) and rewind to see them over again. This often prompts me to say in a Marv Albert type voice, ""Let's see that again!"" All in all, it had a good plot, but it was just boring. If this movie were remade today with the advancements we have with special effects, this movie could be saved from the burning pits of B-rated movie Hell and possibly grip my interest."
5,Peter Hall Tribute,So I am a huge Predator fan and when I found out that Peter Hall played the Psycho Bear in Prophecy that I loved when I was younger I had to have it. Its not the CGI movie of today but it has a message and is worth the watch.
3,THE BEST FILM ABOUT A GIANT MUTANT GRIZZLY BEAR I'VE EVER SEEN?!,"It's hard to really come down too hard on this low budget horror flick. It's script which is its biggest obstacle is clumsy and gets a little long in the tooth when it talks about chemicals spewing mercury into a fresh water supply, but despite some cheap special effects, it does deliver some tension and fun scares. It also benefits from having a decent cast, which are certainly above the material here. I found this film to be much more fun and frightening than the film Grizzly, so if you want to see a horror movie about a monster bear, then this is probably your best bet. It's certainly a fun Halloween flick!****UPDATE**** One of my Amazon buddies Durrkk informed me that this wasn't a low budget film as it cost more than 12 million to make, a pretty fair sum for the times. Thanks for letting ""Mr. Know It All"" know the lowdown! ;-b"
2,a throw back to the big monster movies of the 50's,"this movie is really silly and fun in the ""so bad it's good"" area.the monster(an inside/out bear!!!!) is really bad looking but the story of water pollated by a heartless company is really just a 50's big bug movie redone for the 70's. great fun if you get into the feel of it"
2,Pretty funny CRAP!,I saw this movie on t.v. but I'm pretty sure it was mostly uncut. Overall this movie is so poor it was terribly funny. The acting is atrocious and the overall quality was a pile of dung. If you want a great movie to laugh about and make fun of with some buddies this is it.
4,Revenge of Nature,"Prophecy is another ""revenge"" of nature movie that show the effect of mercury poisoning on nature. Robert Foxworth is a dedicated doctor sent by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to investigate pollution in the woods of Maine from a lumber mill. This is causing friction between the mill and the native Indians. Foxworth finds that the wildlife is mutating (e.g., large tadpoles, freaky looking bear). Talia Shire (Adrian from the Rocky movies) plays Foxworth wife who is afraid that her unborn child may be ""contaminated."""
2,MUTANT MISERY,"Considering the pedigree of this late 70s film, it should have turned out much better: a script by David Seltzer (the original OMEN) and director John Frankenheimer (MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE original). However, PROPHECY falls flat on its face, becoming a tired, dull and disjointed thriller focusing on the effects of mercury poisoning.Ghetto doctor Robert Foxworth and his cellist wife Talia Shire are asked to go to the New England forests to decipher any ill effects from the large paper mill there. Native Americans led by Armand Assante and Victoria Racimo are protesting the cutting down of their forests, and when several people start turning up dead, the Indians are blamed. Turns out however that the mercury being dumped into the water supply is creating savage deformed mutants, including some of the hokiest creatures ever assembled. The main monster is an overgrown bear. There's little suspense or novelty in this film and the performances all look called in. A real disappointment."
2,Terrible,"""Prophecy"" might have been a good monster movie-but they forgot to create a good monster. The mutated bear creature is hysterical."
3,A funny misfire of a movie.,"Prophecy certainly has a good idea to work with. Mercury poisoning from a paper mill's pulping process has created horrible mutations in the surrounding forest. Unfortunately director John Frankenheimer and screenwriter David Seltzer do not seem to have a clue about how to make this 'important' monster movie work properly. The monster is seen too clearly and too often, thus easily recognized as a man in a cumbersome suit, and Frankenheimer fails to build any real suspense, the attack scenes becoming more laughable than frightening as the film progresses. As a failure however the movie is quite entertaining, but it will most certainly scare younger children (as it did me during it's original theatrical run). Recommended to bad movie fans."
4,Not too bad,"This is another movie I enjoy that most critics usually rip to shreds. ""Prophecy"" is actually a fairly good horror movie with a strong environmental message. The main characters are likeable and convincing. One drawback: the rampaging, deformed ""bear"" is not very realistic-looking. In fact, he looks somewhat silly. The special-effects team of ""Prophecy"" should have worked a little bit harder on that. The DVD picture quality is very good, although the only ""extra"" is English subtitles. Nothing else. Not even a trailer."
4,the ultimate popcorn movie!,"Prophecy is one of the few PG rated horror movies that will actually scare you.The atmosphere is very creepy and will keep you tense.Robert Foxworth, one of the best dramatic actors of that era, give a fantastic performance as the doctor who is called in to investigate environmental matters in the Maine forest only to be thrown in to a nightmarish sequence of events. The monster, a mutated grizzly bear, is one of the most horrific looking creatures ever put on film. However, I could have done without Talia Shire's constant whining and depressed state. Anyway this is still a good horror film with plenty of gore(which is a little exetreme for a PG rating)and a few laughs like the sleeping bag scene."
3,There is Something in the Woods and it's Hungry,"3 Stars = GoodI went to the theater & saw this film. Though many thought it was hokey, I'm a sucker for a monster movie, & this one is pretty good. Sure the special effects are dated by today's standards, but there is a healthy amount of dread & suspense, & some great chase scenes. The opening monster sequence is a doozy!Well worth a watch on a night you have nothing to do, out in the woods, isolated from the world!""Prophecy"" 1979"
4,Deep Sleep Helps,"Off all the relaxation and hypnois Cd""s ,I have tried over the past several years; this one works the best.I have been an insomiac for over forty years and this CD,if played nightly or couple times a night is the most benificial. I would like to buy other CD""s of this type. Any suggestions?"
2,Seems to have the opposite effect on me,"I've tried this one three times, and each time lay awake for hours after it was over. I know he's trying, but I guess someone telling me to ""go to sleep"" over and over doesn't work for me. His calmness meditation CD actually works better for me, maybe because it doesn't get me thinking about sleep. I think a ""sleep"" CD almost brings out performance anxiety in me or something. I can't recommend this one, based on my own experience."
4,Very good to fall asleep the first time at night.,"As I said in the title, this works quite well at helping me fall asleep the first time that I use it at night. Unfortunately I usually wake up several times through the night and this doesn't seem to work as well when I use it then."
3,Interesting,if you can get past his accent it might be helpful. I have used it a few nights and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I know I never sleep deeply nor do I sleep thru the night
4,Very Good,I listen to it most every night. It does help me to sleep through the night. I'm glad I bought it.
2,Just not very useful,"The claim that this somehow puts you in a trance or a state like hypnosis is bunk. It helps marginally to get you relaxed but not nearly as good as a decent book for pleasure reading. Honestly, I think what the speaker is doing more or less is trying to bore you until you doze off.I'd have given this 1 star, but I figure it's helping some people, so I didn't want to be overly negative based on my own experience.I ultimately got a prescription product that is working well. If you have mild or occasional insomnia, perhaps this will help you, but I had to turn elsewhere."
1,Voice is irritating,"I bought the tapes Deep Sleep Every Night and A Guided Meditation several years ago and had to give them away because his voice is distracting and irritating. They did not help me relax at all. Some other reviewers seem to like his CDs, so I would definitely listen to demos before I purchased the CDs."
3,could be better,"I bought this sled for my 4 year old. It does go fast, almost too fast for him. The breaking system is a little difficult for my son. He often forgets to use it. It goes the best in our plowed driveway. My husband had a difficult getting it to go together. The skis are supposed to snap into place. They have never fully snapped in. It is not as big a hit as we thought it would be."
3,"Cool looking product, HORRIBLE ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS...","This flyer looks pretty cool, I can't wait to give it to my son for Christmas. HOWEVER,I have to say, assembly could have been easier---the instructions are reminiscent of an old mimeograph, the photo is a super-black photocopy with minimal definition. It looks more like an Ink Blot test, and makes understanding the instructions with the aid of the photo useless. Also, the warning sticker on the rear of the seat has me a little uneasy---""product has no steering..."" is that not what I paid $75 to get?!?"
5,My son and Grandson just love it,Purchased this for my grandson for Christmas. Both my son and grandson are having a ball on it. Some assembly required but grandpa was happy to do it.
3,Disappointed,We had a similar sled for the kids when they were young and it has lasted for years. This one came apart after a coupe of runs and the plastic was too cold to reattach so the old one did double duty. After bringing it home and warming it up I was able to reattach it. This time I screwed the parts together! We're waiting for more snow!I forgot to mention that when it first came the box had been damaged and the two back skis were missing. Amazon got us a new one very quickly.
1,Not the quality you'd expect from Flexible Flyer,This product quality is junk at best. My grandson couldn't wait for the first snow to go for a ride. 3 trips down a snowy grass covered field and the side runner had broken off. I watched him ride it myself and he did not in any way abuse the sled or try stunts that would have led to the complete failure of the sled after 3 runs. For the money the reputation of the brand name Flexible Flyer is a piece of trash that ruined a boys Christmas.Kathy Fulmer
1,Danger!,"I rode this twice and broke it on the second run. It is unstable to control, and on the second ride I ended up snapping the steering wheel off in my hand. The removable steering wheel is not an intended feature."
1,The 'one ride' sled,"My father purchased two of these sleds for my 5 and 7 year old children last winter. First ride down was amazing - they could steer and were in control. Second ride they both crashed and both of the front skis broke in half. I mean broke in HALF. How depressing as it took me an entire afternoon to snap the sleds together. i tried to find some spare parts because all we need is replacement skis, but that isn't possible it seems. I don't recommend this product at all unless you like broken pits of plastic hanging around your garage."
4,Flexible PT Blaster,"I'm not sure yet about this. It's for Christmas, so I'm waiting to assemble it. The box was very ripped when I got it. All seems to be here though, I Hope. Fast delivery."
2,Not so good...,"I Love Britney and I think she's amazing but this DVD is NOT worth the money. I was expecting to feature all her videos from ""Baby one more time"" to ""Not a girl"" but it only has 3 actual videos on it. The DVD runs a total of 27 minutes and includes a Pepsi commercial which I'm upset cause they didn't include the actual 2 1/2 minute version one. This ones only 1 1/2 minutes. the only good thing about this DVD is that it's Britney and the sequences that they did are really cool."
5,Great Britney,"Britney is the best. Good video. IAS4U, DLMBTLTK, NAGNYAW music videos included. Also, crossroads movie trailers, photo shoots, pepsi commericial, and slave performance at VMAS (think snakes). Although it's not that long, it's great."
4,iam a slave for britney,well here it goes this is the dvd that made me lose 67 pounds really it changed my life the video for slave especiallly it inspired me so much so this dvd really is worth it not just for inspiration but to look at her abs and cool dance moves
3,"Even though it's short, it's still packed.","It is only about 30 minutes long, but it still has things that no Britney fan should be without. It has her muzic videos 4 ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"", ""I'm A Slave 4 U"", and ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"". It also has a video 4 ""Overprotected"" 4 her movie Crossroads. It has a making of Crossroads feature, clips of Britney during her photo shoots, a live performance of ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" from the 2001 Mtv Video Music Awards, and her first Pepsi commercial."
1,I WISH WE COULD NOT BE PULL LEGGED,I CANNOT BUY THIS DVD BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF DVD I WILL BUY. I NEED TO KNOW THE TRACK LIST. PLEASE.CLIENTS ARE ALWAYS IN REASON!
3,Could have been better,"""Britney: The Videos"" is good, but there was so much that could have been added to make it better. They included the VMA 2001 performance which was just amazing, but I really think they should have added the famous 2000 VMA performance as well. There are only four videos here. Two from the new album ""Britney"" (by the way, the ""Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"" video included on here is different than the one seen on MTV) and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know from her second album Oops!...I Did It Again. The behind the scenes is nothing really special. The one with the photo shoot is Britney just dancing to ""Anticipating."" Of course any fan will be happy to own this, but it was rushed and there should have been more interviews, etc. If you're a Britney fan, get it, but if you're expecting a lot from this DVD, don't get it."
3,I expected more from Britney: The Videos,"The title itself is misleading but overall, Britney: The Videos is a short, not-that-great DVD release to satisfy Britney's fans, such and me. Though I did enjoy the videos I thought the HBO section would be the entire concert, so I didn't purchase Britney Live in Las Vegas on DVD. Don't buy this DVD unless you are a Brit fan! 3 out of 5 stars because it's misleading, and mediocre satisfaction."
3,kind of a waste of money,"I WAS DISAPOINTED IN THIS DVD. THERE'S NOT A LOT ON IT. THERE'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING YOU COULDN'T JUST TAPE OFF OF MTV.1. DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW-- MIGHT AS WELL TAPE IT OFF MTV2. I'M A SLAVE 4 U(VMA 2001 PERFORMANCE)-- AGAIN, YOU COULD TAPE THIS OFF MTV3. BRITNEY'S FIRST PEPSI COMMERCIAL-- WELL, IT'S THE WHOLE COMMERCIAL, SO THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS YOU COULDN'T TAPE OFF TV4. I'M A SLAVE 4 U(VIDEO)-- SURPRISE, SURPRISE, YOU COULD TAPE THIS OFF MTV5. BEHIND THE SCENES OF VOUGE PHOTO SHOOT-- CAN'T GET THIS OFF TV6. I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN MUSIC VIDEO-- I GUESS THIS IS A DIFFERENT VERSION, BUT I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY HUGE DIFFERENCES. TAPE IT OFF MTV!!7. OVERPROTECTED WITH OUTAKES FROM CROSSROADS-- YOU CAN SEE THIS ON THE ENHANCED PORTION OF THE CD8. LIVE FROM LAS VEGAS COMMERCIAL-- TAPE IT OFF TV9. MAKING OF CROSSROADS-- SOME COOL BEHIND THE SCENES OF CROSSROADS STUFF"
3,could be Britney's worst DVD so far...,"This DVD called ""The Videos"" has 2 MISERABLE MUSIC VIDEOS! ""I'm not a girl, not yet a woman"" it isn't the video, it's a performance in Sydney, Australia; and in the DVD box, says ""Britney Spears Live From Las Vegas""...it's a 20 second tv commercial, anyone cold think it's the concert or the making of of it, because anywhere says that it is a commercial.The DVD makers should have waited Britney to have more music videos from the 3rd CD, because it has only ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" as music video. If you see Britney's ""In The Zone"" DVD, at least it has a full TV special and the Making The Video for Toxic.If you buy this DVD, you will take 30minutes to see it from the beginning, until the end of the end credits, because there's nothing else to see."
4,Spears' Self Titled DVD Pretty Good,"""Britney:The Videos"" was Miss. Spears' third official DVD/video. Unlike her previous releases, this one is named after her third disc ""Britney"". While it follows her songs and commercial from the album, it also comtains the music video ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"", from her sophomore release. It also includes a behind-the-scenes from her movie ""Crossroads"". The only bad thing about this DVD is that it is only like 30 minutes, whereas her previous ones were more close to a full hour at least. And also, there is nothing in here that you can't see on TV. However, that doesn't matter if you are a Brit fan, and if you are, this is for you."
2,Surprisingly Disappointing,"I expected this video to have her hit videos. But when I sat down to watch it, it began with ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"" which is a great video so I was like 'hey this is cool'. Then it went into her ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" VMA performance and then the video. And then it's just her dancing at photoshoots to her song ""Anticipating"". What's with that? And then there's ""Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman""...no argument there. Then Behind Crossroads. Which is interesting...but not. And then her ""Overprotected"" performance. And that's it. Then it ends with some pictures with the credits. I guess I expected way too much from a Britney Spears video but I thought there'd be a LITTLE more to it."
2,This is NOT a video collection,"BRITNEY: THE VIDEOS is misleading. There are exactly 3.. yes 3 music videos TOTAL on here. They are: ""don't let me be the last to know"", ""I'm a slave 4 u"", and an alternate ""I'm not a girl, not yet a woman."" The rest of it consists of a photo shoot?! That's right, Britney taking cute photo's while ""anticipating"" plays in the background. Was that necessary?! Even worse, it also includes her pepsi commerical. To me, this was a complete waste. The record company could've put together a real video collection with all of Britney's videos. BRITNEY: THE VIDEOS also includes a sneak peak at her new movie CROSSROADS and also the MTV performance of ""I'm a slave 4 u""."
1,Brittney Spears is AWFUL!! TWO THUMBS D-O-W-N!,BRITTNEY IS SO AWFUL! WHY AM IM I TYPING HERE?! TO GET THROUGH YOUR HEADS THAT BUYING HER CD IS A WASTE OF GOOD MONEY! SHE STAND FOR BAD THINGS HER CLOTHER ARE EXTREMELY A-W-F-U-L! HER SISTER IS BETTER THAN HER! IF YOU LIKE BRITTNEY SPEARS THAN I HATE TO SAY THIS AND I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE BUT THEN...THATS SAD!HOPEFULLY THIS WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT!
3,Not Exactly what the title Implies,"It's not a bad collection,but it isn't exactly what the name implies. Yes,It would be good to include Britney's entire video collection all in 1 place.The only place I have seen 'Born To Make You Happy' is on the videotape that McDonald's sold last year.If you're a big Britney fan,this is one for you to add to your collection. But for only 30 minutes long, its a bit expensive. I'll wait for the Live in Las Vegas DVD. More excitement for the money."
2,just ok,"Although I am a Britney fan, I was disappointed with this DVD. Live in Hawaii was much better- much longer, more personal (with Britney hanging out, surprising fans, etc.) many more performances (SNL skits, 2 SNL songs, tons of songs from Hawaii concert, three videos.) This was only around 30 minutes long and did not have the same personal touch that Hawaii did. The commercials and outtakes from the movie were kind of pointless."
1,totally misleading,"This DVD is extremely misleading. On the back cover, it lists ""HBO presents: Britney Spears live from Las Vegas"" as one of the features. One would assume that this is the concert that aired on HBO a few weeks ago. IT'S NOT!!! It's a commercial advertising the concert. That is ridiculous. Save your money and buy something else. You don't find out that it's a commercial until you've already opened the DVD and played it. By that time, you can't take it back. It would be ridiculous to waste any amount of money on this skimpy DVD. Half of the other stuff on the DVD can be found in the enhanced features on the Britney CD. And, if you want to see the videos, they are played on MTV frequently. Don't waste your money."
1,"Title is misleading, content is poor.","From the DVD's title, ""The Videos,"" one might expect that it actually contains ALL of Britney's videos. In reality, it only contains three (four if you count the ""Crossroads-Overprotected"" video) and the rest of the DVD is simply a plug for her newest DVD, ""Britney Live from Las Vegas"" and her new movie ""Crossroads."" There isn't any content on the DVD, merely Britney Strikes a Pose, (not interesting, and The Making of the Movie Crossroads (also not very interesting). There's little diaglogue, just her talking about her movie. If you enjoy watching commercials, that's all this DVD is. If you enjoy content and a DVD that's worth the time to watch it and the money to buy it, skip this one. I wish I would have."
3,Not the Best of the 3,"I liked this...but it could have had more.It has the videos for ""Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know""(which I was wondering if it was going to get on a DVD.Much like""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"".)And the unoffical videos for ""Not A Girl""and""Overprotcted"".If you're wanting to get all the Britney DVDs but only one at a time I would wait and get this one last.It was good but not as good as the others(Time Out with Britney and Britney Live and More)"
3,A little bit dissapoiting,"Although this Dvd isn""t bas it""s not god either. It""s just too short. There are three good performances of I""m Slave For You, I""m Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman and Overprotected, 2 great videos and commercials and behind the scens and that""s it! Buy it only if you""re a real fan."
4,Perfect for a fishbowl,I had a couple of goldfish dumped on me and was cleaning their bowl every other day. This filter keeps the water clean and sanitary for them until I can get them a larger aquarium for them. I've been very happy with it for the price I paid. Reviews on other sites have indicated this is a loud filter but I find it to be very quiet - all you can hear are bubbles. It's perfect for my office desk.
2,Strongarm 4490 Support Very disappointed,"Although the Strongarm Products have been very good in the best, the 2 recent purchases have had disappointing results. In fall weather with temperatures in the 50 degree range they barely hold the rear hatch. They perform as if they are not completely pressurized. Once the temperature drops another 40 degrees I would suspect them to fail.Very disappointed!!!!"
5,Just plain fun to read,"This book is just plain fun to read -- over and over again! It was one of the first books that my toddler would actually sit and listen to, and now at 18 months he's an active participant -- searching for the old black fly on each page and giving him a playful SWAT! I definitely recommend purchasing this book in hardcover, as the soft binding is simply no match for its popularity."
1,Below expectations,"This book is not very pleasing. The pictures are done in that ""insane, stressed, spattered watercolour"" style akin to the disturbing psycho comics out today. The book is disguised as an alphabet book, but it does not have a good rhyme to it - and the pictures are harsh and ""messy"". Finally, the fly who the child begins to identify with gets squashed in the end. Not the kind of book I want to read to my son. There are better books out there for the money."
2,Not for my 2 yr old,"This book has a few good points, but more bad points. I liked how the alphabet is bolded throughout the book (my 2 yr old identifies each letter right off) and I like the repetition of ""Shoo Fly Shoo"". However, the book really doesn't have a good 'flow' and I was NOT impressed with the illustrations. The family in the book is haggard and sloppy.This book seems more appropriate for elementary-aged children. I would imagine that classroom teachers could use it quite often. I appreciate the comment of one person saying, ""for those older kids who don't know their letters, this is a more age appropriate book."" I agree with that.After reading the story, I feel like there are fly germs everywhere . . ."
3,unspectacular,"I agree with everything santa-fe listener wrote. Let me add that these interpretations are far too rigid and classical in shape; they lack Beethoven's characteristic mixture of passion and nobility one can hear in the interpretiations by Karajan, Kleiber and Furtwangler. It is simply wrong to conduct Beethoven as if you were conducting Mozart like Wand does here.I look forward to reading the expected abusive reponses from the (evidently) highly intelligent Wand fan club.The Penguin Guide and the Gramophone Magazine are very far from infallible."
1,communist party line,"I found this book dishonest because schell uses quotations out of context, has unnamed sources when using gossip, and tries to sound like a friend of Tibet when he clearly is not. His position is clearly for China's invasion of Tibet. In this book are all the old misinformations that the Chinese government has been using to justify invading Tibet. He spent so many pages talking about Brad Pitt, whom he had not spoken to, and all Brad Pitt did was act in a movie about Tibet. Mr Schell knows nothing about Tibetan Buddhism and should not be writing on the subject. Readers should get the information from thier sources. For Mr. Schell's position read up on the Chinese Communist position. For books on Buddhism find books about Buddhism, preferably from authoritative Tibetan sources. For human rights issues Amnesty International is a good source. Don't waste your time reading this ill informed and biased author."
1,Biased account,"Full of misquotes, untruths and gossip this book adds no new information on Tibet, but rather glosses over the tremendous devastation created by China in Tibet. How does anyone rationalize the murder, directly and indirectly, of more than one million Tibetans by the Chinese?"
4,Tibet 101,"This is a quick read highlighting Tibet's relationship to the outside world, especially through fallicious film accounts. It gives a good background of the country without getting too pedantic. A very good source for those seeking a good overview without th political and religious details."
3,Mine had a limited life span,"I got one of these as a gift. It was ok, in a slightly dorkish sort of way. At least I thought so.1. It's not remotely programmable. You use a built in UI to spell out your messages, which come up randomly along with things like ""Good Morning"" or ""Happy New Year"". The display changes every few seconds, along with fade and wipe effects. The time doesn't just ""stand still"", which would really be much cooler.2. The LED is held to the oscillating plastic wand by a small metal piece that, in my case, eventually failed due to metal fatigue. Took about 2 years. That was that."
1,not worth the money,The XP3 Ultra Clock is no good. I bought it the last of March and it didn't even last for 2 months. Now I am stuck with it. I would not reccommend it to anyone.
2,"Cool gift, 50/50 chance of working","So I purchased this exact clock 2 years ago as a gift for my grandfather who likes gadgets. It worked great for almost a full year then stopped working (of course it was running 24 hours a day, I can't blame it). After it broke I bought a new one, it lasted for 2 days before breaking again. My time is too precious to dig in a rubbish can to locate the box and go to the post office to return it, or I would. Sadly, I wont be buying another anytime soon for fear of it breaking; and I just wasted 50 dollars for the clock."
4,Very informative,It provided me with information of how and why many of our bombing missions were planned. Being that I flew 51 missions with the 15th Airforce during the period was you outlined in the book.
3,Dead Horse,"It's very easy to armchair the decisions of the past. If the author has been one of the principal decision makers,we probably would have lost the war."
4,A Moral War?,"I think that after one reads Harry S. Stout's ""Upon the Altar of the Nation: A Moral History of the Civil War"" this is a good follow on before one takes on any ""moral"" analysis of any later conflicts such as Vietnam, Iraq 1 -Iraq 2, Afganistan, or the current drone attacks. It is also a good parallel to Cautious Crusade: Franklin D. Roosevelt, American public opinion, and the war against Nazi Germany."
4,How to draw comics the Marvel way is good but old!,"How to draw comics the Marvel Way is a good book but it's very old information. I think that Marvel comics and the comic book industry has changed since this book was published in 1978 and 1984. Don't get me wrong! I like this How to draw comics the Marvel Way! book written by Stan Lee with artwork by John Buseama, but the books information is too old. I think comic book artists today use better materials besides paint brushes and india ink. You buy Markers with india ink in them at an artsupply store. there are other things in this book that do not appy to comic books in 2008 as well. If your a begining artist, I will recommend this book but It's not for advance artist. B+"
3,More a basis than the only tome you will need,"Overcoming Stan's hyperbolic style, the earlier chapters of the book are the most useful and where any aspirant artist should make sure they have everything covered. Particularly good are the perspective chapters.Later on the book tends to gloss over things, partially (one suspects) because they are harder to explain. Having been through various copies over the years I can assuredly say I have yet to actually glean anything from the composition chapter and there is precious little of any use in the inking section.A good foundation, but nothing particularly more."
3,A LIGHT LUNCH,"I bought this book when I was a teenager, and found the content very helpful when drawing comics and cartoons - the Marvel Way. The Stan Lee Humour and John Buscema art work were truly inspirational. All the sections from figure drawing, through to layout, inking and perspective were simple and straightforward, making it easy for a novice to understand. That, however, was also the book's downfall. Overall, it tended to lack depth and I was always left with the feeling that there should have been more. If your looking for a 'starter' - buy it. But if you want a 'main-course', look elsewhere."
3,"good, but outdated","This book is well put together, but not very useful to a learning artist. The style is really outdated. All the heroes look pretty much the same; Caucasian, strong-jawed Reed Richards-type people. And all the heroines look the same too!"
2,Don't get your hopes up,"For all you aspiring artists, if you can't draw, this won't help. If you can, then you really don't need this book.It may be mildly interesting for an afternoon to someone who draws leisurely."
2,"SORRY, STAN","When I was a teenager, this book was the bible for any kid wanting to get into comics. In retrospect, I wonder why--I mean, it's not really informative and it doesn't give anything away--i.e., give you any details on the finer point of comic book storytelling and drawing. In short, it's as instructional as a Lee Ames book, and that's not saying much. Besides, in light of the new direction that comic books are going these days, it's a bit dated. If you really want to get into comics, here are four great books to get you started: The Encyclopedia of Cartooning Techniques (an overview of cartooning, from technical stuff to business aspects), The Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Science Art Techniques, Chris Hart's How To Draw Animation (because animation helps a lot, kids!), and let's not forget Wil Eisner's great book that started it all! Sorry, Stan. My verdict--2 stars; but add an extra star if you're a 12 year old aspiring comic book artist just for it's inspirational benefits."
4,good book for serious artists,This book is a good book for artist who will spend some time on it. Stan Lee and John Buscema used many ideas for drawing the charectors in an easier way. They also wrote it so normal people could understand it. This book help me make my charectors look more authentic and almost come alive.
3,An introduction to drawing comics,The character styles in this book are dated (men look like slightly bigger women). You will not learn how to draw huge men or extreemly shapely women with this book. It just skims the surface of most issues.Still it is a good introduction to drawing. It teaches all the basic rules. I have had my copy for years and I still like reviewing it every once in a while.
5,Drawing Without a Model,"Don't let the patronizing title fool you. This is a great resource for learning to draw without a model, as are Burne Hogarth's ""Dynamic Figure Drawing"" and ""Dynamic Anatomy.""John 3:16 ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."""
5,Fond Memories,"It is really a pleasure to come across this book online. I bought it maybe thirty years ago, when I was a preteen, and was developing a serious interest in design. Without a doubt, much of it is dated; particularly since so much of what the book describes can be done on a computer, and quickly. However, in doing graphic design work/illustration, I have often fallen back on the basic principles communicated in the book-e.g. its cues on how to render the human body. Subsequently, I think that it's an excellent primer, and will provide you with a great foundation on how to illustrate."
5,Best drawing book I have ever had!,"I chose this rating because of the many valuable info therer is included in this book about art, and because of the mint and perfect condition it arrived in! To me there are no cons. Nothing but an excellent drawing book! :)"
3,This is the older version.,"This book is great for a beginner, even one who doesn't know how to draw at all. If you are getting this for a talented artist who already has the skills to draw and shade his characters this way, I recommend getting the limited edition instead. This paperback version does not have the sections on coloring, costuming, and promoting your work, that the new hardcover edition has."
4,The book for poeple who think they know how to draw comics,"I first read this book in the 7th grade, it was prehaps the most informative and eye opening book on the comic art. Unlike some comic illustration instructional books, How to Draw Comics the Marvel way handles more than just charater design. They show budding artist how to make comic panels interesting. This book keeps you from becoming a copy-cat artist."
4,I liked it alot.But could have been different,I think it was really cool but that Liz should have broken up with Todd.They have been going out for to long. Bruce and Liz are perfect match.For me Pam is a geek.She would be the perfect match with Todd.[not that Todd is a geek].You should read it.
1,"From Reading the Previous Reviews, Teens are Being Misled","This book was interesting, but gave a completely false view of real life. Why? If two 16 year olds were to move in together in real life (I am 14), they would most likely end up having sex. It's not that they are sickos or something, it is just how our society acts and pushes them to do. No matter what their age, boyfriend and girlfriends should not live together. Francine Pascal sends out some very mixed signals about what teens should be doing in this book. I was really upset after reading this! It is very unrealistic and morally confusing--and whether or not someone says, morals DO matter."
3,"Informative, but not great",This book is a little disappointing as it has a number of photos which do not seem directly relevent to the subject. Why for example are chess pieces used as examples of soldiers's uniforms as they are very stylised? Or take the clothing in Russian museum collections. The text is good like most of the work of this author which I have read and the illustrations of the many Islamic and Non-Islamic soldiers who fought for the Caliphates are well executed.
5,A very good book,I believe the book is a good reference to those who working on local structures by pdf.
4,Silent Siege III,"Very interesting and factual accounts of little known aspects of World War Two. Book is NOT afraid to take the unpopular view,such as ""Japs"" living on West Coast were a danger to U.S.Some of material tends to be what I call ""filler space"" and could have been omitted."
3,Content: interesting. Style: poor,"The late Bert Webber wrote/edited many books on Pacific Northwest History. His ability to research topics was good. In this case, his research on the topic of submarine attacks, the GLENN air attacks, and the balloon bombings is superb. However, his writing style distracts from the quality of the research.As a source of information, the book is good. As a source of entertainment and joy of reading, it is poor."
5,Great!,This book gave me needed info to interpret EKGs!! I read it in two days and use it as speedy reference. Very great to have around
4,Great clinical review,I'm an RN and have taken numerous EKG courses related to my work in an ICU. I found this book to be a great review and a good source of some new knowledge that may help in my clinical practice. This book was easy to follow and didn't take me long to read from cover to cover. I plan to use it as a quick reference in the future. I would recommend this book to any health care provider looking to increase their knowledge of EKG interpretation.
5,great book,"I would highly recommend this book to every medical student. I am a student myself and I have read a lot of EKG material only to realize that I could not remember anything a week later. This book covers basics of EKG, and it does it in a way that it actually sticks into you mind. Great explanations, you learn about EKG step by step, and understand it, not just memorize it. Of course this book is not enough to read EKG in clinical practice, but it gives you good foundation for further studying."
4,Review of Durbin,The book is very helpful and provides a step-by-step approach to those looking to advance their knowledge of cardiac disease and treatment. Durbin's approach to teaching in the book is great. It requires interaction from the reader that helps with the memorization of key points.
4,Fun way to learn EKGs,"Dubin's book on EKGs has a different approach that includes repetition of ideas, blanks for self-assurance, and a lot of review. The back of the book includes many strips for easy reference and review. Reading is enjoyable. The basics are covered first and pathology is covered last, from less challenging strips to more challenging. I got a lot out of this book. I had another EKG learning-book, which didn't compare to the fun and ease of learning that Dubin's book has. This book is good for future reference also. Buy and keep!"
1,"Decent EKG book to start, but if I had to do it again I would not buy Dubin's book.","As a second year med student this was a decent introduction to EKGs. It walks the reader through everything, leads, axis, etc. all step-by-step. However the book begins to fall short with more complicated topics - bundle blocks (there's some errors and a lot of info missing when it comes to differentiating Left and Right bundle blocks), as well as falling short on myocardial infarction.[...]"
5,"Excellent condition, in time",I got 2 books: this one (Dubin ECG) and the Step1 First Aid. Both were in impeccable condition and arrived on time.
4,well structured for learning,"The structure of the book (illustration at the top of the page, FITB questions to the left answers to the right) lends itself to repetition and review of the material. The book itself is very well bound and constructed (for a paperback) with thick pages and vibrant color. The level of detail and well grounded review of EKG tracings allow you to better understand the physics behind the waves and build upon it to help understand the more complex topics to follow.However, I have never read any other EKG books, so I cannot compare it with other texts. Also, even though I am only on chapter 5, alot of the material I have been exposed to through ACLS classes. Stay fresh my nuggs."
3,A cursory introduction to reading 12-lead EKG's,"This book is a classic, and it will get you through the basics...the good doctor himself apparently has a checkered past you may want to investigate before sending him money...I was fortunate enough to have a very skilled ER doc teach me how to read EKG's through lecture (I'm a PA student) and the ECG in 10 Days book by Ferry...I can't imagine trying to learn this stuff without some feedback from someone who actually does it for a living."
3,Review,I bought this book to use in PA school. It really simplifies EKG readings. I would recommend it for studying although I wouldn't bring it into a hospital or doctor's office during rotations...a little too simplified.
3,Not bad,This book doesn't seem to be too bad. I do think it is almost a bit childish in its teaching methods though.
3,"Adequate, but lacks organization","I started out with this book and I found the ""fill in the blanks"" too distracting. It was difficult to read this book and walk away remembering what you need to know. It will get you by, but I found ""The Only EKG Book You'll Ever Need"" a much better resource."
5,good book,I just got it today and i can tell you it was very well packed! the book arrived in great quality and the pictures are wonderful it really tells you how it work. and the pages are thick and shinny. i reconend you buy this
2,Very boring,"I know that this book is a classic, but I found it incredibly boring and tedious to read. I recommend The Only EKG Book You'll Ever Need. It's a much more enjoyable read."
4,I will keep this book in my collection,This is a helpful reference book and helped me with my EKG class.
1,Not for medical students and residents,"Dubin's EKG book was a required text during my second year of medical school. I struggled with EKG interpretation even after reading this book. Other classmates expressed the same feelings. A large reason for this is that Dubin uses a ridiculous fill-in-the-blank approach that favors rote memorization over true understanding. It actually becomes more distracting to learn with this method than to just read an narrative explanation.Judging from the favorable reviews listed here, this book is probably better suited for other medical personnel such as paramedics, nurses, and technicians. Medical students and residents need a deeper level of understanding which this book does not provide.Look elsewhere for your EKG needs, such as Thaler's ""The Only EKG Book You'll Ever Need."""
5,Very good book,This is very good book for ECG i have ever seen. The explanation is very illustrative and fundamental. Very happy to have this book..strongly recommended...............
5,One of the few books you'll actually use again and again,"I am a second year medical student and my professors recommend that we order this book to help us understand EKGs. Normally, I would never by a text book because you rarely use them, but the guy who was asked to teach us was so bad that I broke down and bought it. Thank God I did because it really is idiot proof. It breaks it down into the basics. I was reading it at a coffee shop and I actually had residents come up to me and tell me how much they used and still used that book. It explains why the EKG records, how the waves form and what causes the changes and what that means. It also gives you tips on how to quickly interpret an EKG, which is always a help when you start going on the wards."
2,Is Dr. Dubin kidding?!,"People often rave about this book but in my opinion it is just bad, as it is not written in normal, full sentences. As a memory tool, you have to fill in the blanks in sentences. This doesn't work and only makes you feel like a 6 year old. By the time I got to page 60, I had pulled out half my hair and wanted to jump off a bridge. Try ECGs Made Easy by Aehlert, or The Only EKG Book You'll Ever Need."
3,"Good, but could be much shorter","Dubin's book is not bad. The main text is not terribly high yield for studying for an exam in med school. The format is a little infuriating--too many pages containing trivial information that you're forced to flip through and skim. The useful information in this book, however, is really useful which makes this book somewhat worth reading. The summary/pocket guide that is included in the back is extremely high yield and that alone can be used in conjunction with the course materials/syllabi to get a good picture of typical EKG patterns and their pathophysiology."
5,Rapid Interpretation of EKG's - 6th Edition,"Much more in depth than the 4th Edition and the illustrations in color really help to enhance the concepts in the book! The step-by-step approach to learning to read EKG's makes it easy to learn. The science behind the various abnormalities helps to tie them to the causes and to differentiate between benign and serious conditions. A ""must have"" for anyone learning to interpret EKG's."
4,very educational,"Wonderful book-I found it very educational. However, the pages all fell out of the binding within the first couple of days."
5,The Gold Standard,I was recommended this text by an exercise specialist in a cardiac rehab program. It is extremely practical with great illustrations and examples that help you remember key points of knowledge in interpreting EKG's. I highly recommend this classic text.
4,"pretty good compared to other ECG books, and definitely better than your med school is teaching you","Got this book for 3rd year IMED rotation where ECGs were a big part of our curriculum. Our school ended up using ""The only ECG book you'll ever need"" for the class so I didn't end up reading this one much. I like that its interactive and it definitely describes the basics of ECGs better than any other book. As far as advanced complicated ECG reading, I think the other book was a bit better because they would have summary pages outlining what to look for to make a diagnosis on a more complicated ECG. Depends what you need the book for and where your knowledge already is which one I would recommend buying. If you are 1st or 2nd year med student get this one for sure."
5,The gold standard,"You will finish this book with a solid, albeit basic, foundation for interpreting EKGs even if starting with little knowledge"
5,Exellent Book,This is an excellent book for anyone who needs a step by step tutorial for learning how to read EKG's. I would highly recommend it.
4,Useful text ...,"Dubin's book provides a solid, neat and quick introduction to the art of reading ECG's.It's clearly only an introductory text, and mastering the art of reading ECG's will require other texts, and a fair amount of teaching and practice....Also, an interesting bit of trivia involves the photograph of the car, that was awarded to a Yale Med student who read the publishers note at the start of the text, which announced that whomever sent in said page would have a chance of winning the car. 5 readers replied, and one indeed did win the car...."
3,i am pleased with my bed product,"I am really comfortable sleep on the bed a lot, do you have any discount for student on any purchase"
4,great,Great beginners book. Afterwards I feel competent at catching the big stuff. Great introduction though.
2,Rating time of delivery and condition of product.,The time of delivery was excellent and the product arrived in excellent condition. It is what our physician expected and is being used to train our technicians and nurses.
1,Poor,"The product was never sent. I e-mailed the supplier X3 per Amazon's policy and the seller never responded to my inquiriers. When I contacted Amazon, they did follow-up for me and refunded my $$.Very disappointing that this happened.I would rate it zero stars for service through this supplier (not Amazon, it was a used book purchase)"
5,Cabin By the Lake/Return to Cabin By the Lake,I was very impressed by the quick shipping of this item. Thank you!
5,A great DVD deal,"This double DVD set is well worth the cost. The first ""Cabin by the Lake"" film was wonderful. I had absolutely no compalints. As far as TV movies go, this is definitely a winner. It was great fun to watch and an interesting idea.The sequel was not as good as the first--it was actually rather bland and silly in comparison. It is still nice to see the movie here with the original as a companion piece of sorts. You can't go wrong with a two for one deal."
4,Entertaining Killer Movies,"Judd Nelson does a good job in both of these movies playing a demented killer named Stanley. The original movie is fairly sinister as we first meet the troubled writer as he is on a killing spree. The sequel is rather funny and more ridiculous, as Stanley puts on cheesy disguises to gain entry to the filming of the movie of his earlier killing rampage(from the first movie).I have both of these movies in my collection and find both of them entertaining. If you can get them at a decent price, I think they are movies you would want to watch a few times. The scenarios that occur in each of the movies are rather fun to watch as they play out."
3,"Dancable, Prove Of Talent, But Can Be Too Long!","She hasn't had many hits, but the ones she has, had been successful. The remix's on here prove danceable, but seem somewhat overextended. Some tracks should have cut the beat shorter, but the CD shows her voice better, featuring her doing higher, better, and more powerful souring notes! Jessica's remix shows a great voice, better than some of her other stuff, but can get a little boring and you may use the ""skip"" button often. Overall, 3 stars!"
3,A little to early!,"Let me start by saying Jessica rules out of the blonde diva's!This album was mostlikely put out due to the fact that remix albums such as Jennifer Lopez's ""J To Tha Lo"" have done soo well. The only problem with this album is the lack of material, only 7 tracks, and 4 remixed singles in total. The best are 1,5,6,7Basically for the price of a Maxi-Single you can have all these great remix's, soo just check it out for yourself."
5,Jessica Simpson: This is the Remix,"This CD is really good, most of the remixes are dance music, the songs are very long so it makes up for the fact that it only has 7 tracks."
1,Resistible,"One star is too much to give Jessica Simpson's latest cd, ""This Is The Remix."" This album had hardly any publicity and is more like a higher priced cd single than an album. Sadly some tracks have more than one remix which makes this cd a waste of money. I am a Jessica fan and have her two previous cds which by the way are great. Please don't waste your money on this album/single and buy something worth buying like Britney's latest, ""Britney"" or ""Fever,"" by Kylie Minogue."
2,You can do without this!!!,"I'm a Jessica Simpson fan, and even I don't find this worth buying! Sure, I like I Wanna Love You Forever (Soul Solution Radio Remix), Irresistible (feat. Lil' Bow Wow), and A Little Bit (Greek Club Mix). But the rest of the tracks are club mixes consisting of mostly a background beat, and not much in the way of lyrics. They seem to go on for a good half hour!! Great for a D.J., but not for the rest of the public!!"
4,"Too many minutes, but great coverage","So I got a couple of Droids on a family plan for 2 people. There is a huge gap in the minute plans available. 1400 was way too much for us, but the next lowest was far too low, and the lowest plans lose other plan features. So it comes out to be a bit expensive, especially after the required data plans. Otherwise I've been very happy. Verizon also swapped out a defective phone quickly for me."
1,TOTAL BS,"Total B*%#@&!t. If women do not like working in pornography, or the adult industry then don't do it, get a regular job. As for the so-called objectifying of women? How about the reverse-stereotyping that automatically all men, who like to see nude women, think that these adult models/actresses are ""sluts"". I certaintly don't! As for the men they have irrational guilty feelings of adult porn."
2,Junk! Junk! Junk!,"I bought this at a store, thinking it was the 210 model. The plastic is a rough matte finish which will get dirty easily and will be hard to clean. The ""Medium"" ringer setting is too low. On the ""High"" setting, it's too shrill and annoying. I'm going to donate this piece of junk to charity and will buy a Panasonic. When will manufacturers learn that we consumers are tired of junk?"
2,Sound quality hard to tolerate,"I really like the idea of a trimline phone... sits along the side of the computer, taking up very little table space. I just reach over and grab it and say 'hello'... no fanfare, no weird buttons to push... sits in my hand quite comfortably.I always buy a cord detangler for a corded phone, and I am willing to spend the extra $$ for this necessary accessory. Otherwise the cord spirals until nearly impossible to unwind.However, one thing I cannot tolerate is a white noise and static in the background. Apparently it is only at my end, but with the other person on a crappy cell phone, it becomes nearly impossible to decipher the other person's words.I previously bought AT&T; phones --two speaker answering phones in my office that I love!-- with no problems whatsoever. Those are a bit wide for the space I have, but maybe I will be happier with a phone that works properly."
5,Works with MagicJack,"I purchased this phone for use with MagicJack while I am in Iraq. I can dial straight from the phone and the sound quality is perfect. Simply put, It works great. Thank you."
3,Volume is uncomfortably high,"The phone feels great in the hand and up to your ear, but even on the Low setting for the volume of the voice of the person you talk to, it is way too loud and you have to move the phone away from your ear. But looks good and feels good. And it only has last call redial."
2,Works But Ugly,I felt I needed to review this phone because you cannot tell from the picture that the plastic which the casing is made from is that cheap (non-slick) plastic -- kind of like what cheap toys are made from. It looks and feels cheap and not easy to keep clean like the AT&T 205 Slimline. The phone works fine but does not have a lighted keypad like the earlier one. SOOOO I'm on my way to buy a couple of the older models that seem to pack more quality and have the illuminated keypads (which I like for bedside).
1,a not so good phone,The phone is nice looking and small which was perfect for me but the sound quality is not so good it is low sounding and has a lot of static sounding calls.
2,Okay if you don't need to use it,"The phone is cheaply made, but what do you expect for the money? No one can hear me on this phone, so it is now a simple emergency phone. Don't buy it as your MAIN telephone."
1,Works well.....................for about a month,"I really wanted to like this product great price, perfect size, simple to use and program, and a fairly intuitive button layout.However after about a month it lost the code to control my Mitsubishi TV, and then after another couple of months lost the code to control my satellite box.Whats worrying is that no matter how many times I re-program the remote for the TV it will not work (the original TV remote works fine and an identical new PM435SL can be programmed to control the TV).The satellite box can currently be re-programed, but will hold the code for about a month.I guess you get what you pay for and that obviously explains why these are so cheap now.Not even worth the $10 I paid for it."
4,brain teaser,This book was a gift for my 14 year old granddaughter. She loves the challenge of the puzzles and brain teasers. Good stuff.
5,Nice elegant book for people in debt!,I really loved this book. I'm slowly enjoying more of his passages. Don't try to read it all at once because of the number of pages. Just think of a question and then open a chapter. You will get answers to solve your financial challenge. One may imagine reading this book in hard times. I liked the author's personal experiences within this book. It's worth buying and reading. My wife likes this book as well. Great book for people in debt!
4,"Great Characters, Great Story, Great Setting","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was not very familiar with the geographical area or with the story of the Cherry Valley Massacre; but, along with the very well developed characters, the time, the place and the story really came to life. There are enough twists and turns to keep it interesting, but not so many that you feel lost or, worse, like the author has lost the way and is desperately trying to get back to something familiar--a not uncommon problem with first novels! I highly recommend this book and hope for more from Ms. Moon."
5,Excellant Machete,"This machete by Ontario Knife Company is a well made, durable machete. I first saw one of these when my Reserve unit was deployed to Honduras in the 1980's. I liked my issue machete enough to go purchase one. While my jungle trimming days are past, there are still enough tree limbs and branches about the yard that this item makes short work off. It's light, yet hefty enough - if that makes any sense - to plow through 2"" tree branches if wielded with strength. I have had one for 25 years now. I have the plastic issue sheath, which I prefer to the canvas ones more commonly seen now. I prefer the real thing and this is it. Not some 'GI Style' knockoff that may look the part, but won't hold up in battle against those branches."
4,Best Stomach cure that I found,"This supplement does the job in a short amount of time. It is a really good alternative for Brand Name drug Acid reducers. It also doesn't affect the strenth of your bones as does the Brand Name Drugs AND is much less expensive. I have gotten to the point of RARELY having any signs of acid affecting my stomach. It has been about 4 months now since I found and tried the Life Extension, Natural EsophaGuard. The 10 softgels that you need to stop the pain is taken every other day for 20 days; you will feel tremendous relief within days of starting this product.Life Extension, NATURAL ESOPHAGUARD 10 SOFTGELSIt is made from Orange Peel Extract and there are NO SIDE EFFECTS like there are with the Brand Name Drugs. I really swear by this product. Try them; You'll like them."
2,Not for long term,"I was looking for something more natural to treat what I have been told is acid reflux. It may have helped with my heartburn, but did not help my throat at all. Also, the orange burps are not too bad in the beginning, but by day 20 it was making me a little nausous. I did notice I had headaches while taking this and they are gone now so I have to attribute it to the the Esophaguard. Sorry this didn't work."
1,Did not work for me.,I have had to take 20 mg of Omeprazole (Prilosec) every day for years. I followed the instructions to the letter but three days after completing the regimen the reflux was back as bad as ever. I have absolutely no symptoms when I take the Omeprazole daily. My doctor recommended I try it so I thought it would be worth a try.
4,Excellent product.,"I've had intermittent problems with stomach upset and acid reflux for most of my life. I don't really like taking proton pump inhibitors like Nexium and that class of drug, Prilosec in particular always made me feel absolutely sick. About as far as I'll go is Tagamet, which wasn't really working for me this go-round either.I've used Life Extension products in the past, mostly for skin and also the occasional vitamin from time to time, but I felt I was really taking a chance with this one. The same stuff that cleans your countertops was going to help my belly?Well, yeah. It did. After taking the entire regimen, I was having no problems with reflux whatsoever. This after being woken up repeatedly in the middle of the night with that horrible burning in the back of my throat. It's been a year now and still no troubles. If I do have problems with reflux again, I will be sure to pick up another pack of Esophaguard. For me anyhow, it worked."
2,Blu-ray transfer is not much better than the 2003 Special Edition DVD,I am not interested in commenting about the story. All I care about is the DVD transfer to Blu-ray. When I buy a Blu-ray of a previous release I expect it to be significantly better than the DVD edition. This transfer is only marginally better than the 2003 Special Edition release. The only reason for buying the Blu-ray edition is if you don't own the 2003 Special Edition.
1,1 billion thumbs down!,"I'm a major fan of Karen Briggs because of her excellent playing for Yanni on the Acropolis video.But this CD does not showcase her talents at all.The CD is very unproffesionally done.The songs,especially ""Ocean Dream"" and ""God is not dead"" are horrible.And the reviewer from Texas wrote the exact same paragraph that was on the back of the CD.I can't believe Karen Briggs put this CD out.She must've had a bad agent.And the Violin sounds weird.One of the songs,I think it was ""what the world needs"" sounds really weird when the harp was playing.The reviews before mine are very misleading.I am a Violinist myself,and I know when songs have the wrong notes and every song on this CD sounded [terrible]in at least a few of the notes.Don't waste your money-like I did."
1,Hopefully she'll return to Yanni!,"The first reviewer says not to judge her because she played with Yanni but Yanni it was that introduced her great talent to me. She played fantastic and I was hoping I could fine a cd by her. I was totally disappointed. If the calibur of playing was as outstanding when playing with Yanni, her cd would have flown off the shelf. She was and probably still is dynomite but this cd does not reflect it at all. I know what my ear hears and this cd just does not cut it. I truly hope that she returns to Yanni if he goes back to his roots again. She shined is all I can say!"
1,"collectors, this isn't the W&G you're looking for","Unfortunately this set as others have said is full screen only. If you are a completist, and already have the original 3 adventures, the UK 2 disc-edition has the extras you're looking for. For US audience, the documentaries are available as part of a 2 disc exclusive available at another retailer (Wal-Mart), the two discs being ""Curse of the Were Rabbit"" (full or widescreen) along with ""Gromit's Tail Waggin DVD"". Contents of Gromit's Tail Waggin DVD: ""10 Cracking Contraptions"", Making of the Were-Rabbit"", ""The Amazing World of Wallace & Gromit"", ""Gromit's Favorite Scenes"", ""Learn to Draw Gromit"", ""Gromit-Cam"", activity sheets."
1,FULLSCREEN!?!!,"I agree with all the others, PLEASE offer ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" in its original Widescreen. The ""Three Amazing Adventures"" are correctly 4:3 in Fullscreen, but the movie and all the hardwork that was put into it deserves to be all visible, and enjoyed in the way it was made. I guess I have to buy both titles separately..."
1,Ugh. NOT Widescreen!,I never thought the Collector's Set would be fullframe! I'm be returning this today and buying them separately.
1,Boring Creek,"Ok, some guys and gals go camping in a desserted town called blood creek and disturb a legendary spirit. Blah blah blah...Well, where the hell is the action? There is barely none. No blood, no gore, poor editing, poor make-up and sound effects. This one is a snoozer, if you're looking for a similar kind of movie/plot, go with Dead Mary, I think you'll be more pleased."
5,Will always be played on the radio,"I hear songs from this CD all the time on the air, and the disc never leaves my car. :)"
3,Good album...but not as good as his others.,"""Time Marches On"" is a nice album with some classic Country tunes,such as ""If You Loved Me"",""Time Marches On"",""Stars Over Texas"" and ""Is That A Tear"".But the other songs just don't have that same feel to them as the other songs did from his previous albums.It's still good...but nothing like his other albums."
3,Not the best...,"After Properganda, you expect Jin would keep the same mentality and content, with a nice underground feeling, but this album sounds very mainstream. He has some good songs, but they don't shine very much. As a Jin fan since I've seen him on 106 and Park, I'm disappointed."
3,"Ok, but was expecting more...","I am a big Jin fan and I was really excited about this album. After releasing Propaganda I thought Jin has found what his flow. Also, Propaganda is one of my top rap album of all time, so I had hopes for this ""I Promise."" When listening to this album I can to realize that it was ok. He has some good joins like:-Name Calling-Award Show-Chinese Food-I PromiseThere were some other that was ok, but those are the ones I enjoyed the most and then there were some that was weak. It could be do to this album having a lower budget than the previous one(propaganda). I think Jin and Golden Child should get back together again... Also be on the lookout for Jin Chinese album, it should be out right now."
5,excellent probably the BEST album in years,"great emcee definately a hot buy one of the only few cds without filler this guy goes all out beginnin to end and has HOT HOT HOT music with great lyrics and a sick flow and the sickest beatsive heard LOTS of club hits that just don't have the flow or ability of this dude he totally blew them all out of the water on BET and could easily be better than Jay z, nas, maybe eminem this guys a phenomenal artisthear one song want to hear another hes just that good buy this album and u will thank me l8r"
3,The Kid Who Only Hit Homers,"The story commences when Sylvester(the main character) misses his baseball tryouts by a single day. As a boy with little talent in a little town desperately seeking acceptance on the high school team, he convinces his coach to let him play. His mysterious trainer George Baruth, teaches him and helps his ability to grow as the book unfolds with minimal surprise in a mediocre plotline.Overall I thought this book flowed nicely, but was met with many boring moments making me want to put the book down in anguish. I would recommend this book to young readers from the age of first to fifth grade with an interest in Baseball.Your Friend,Tim R."
5,The kid who only hit homers...Awesome books,This was a preselected book by my grandson who lovesto read. I am glad I was able to order it on Amazonand that they make it available through their greatprogram for those who love to read.
1,Disappointed in the reference to the occult,Along with my children we enjoyed this book until the author made reference to the occult. Not sure what the purpose was. I am unable to trust the content of any of Mr Christophers books in the future. Very Disappointed
1,You get what you pay for!,Inova produced products for HSN and they touted lifetime warranty etc. Just try for customer service----does not exist. They had a major recall on one of their lines of cookware. Pots were blowing up. This stuff is made in China and in no way is the quality of Le Cruset or Staub. This is bottom of the line for enameled cast iron!
1,Innova Dutch Oven,"Have purchased the 5 QT version of this Dutch Oven. During the second use of it, the bottom layer developed a bubble, separated from there, making this utensil totally useless. I am now trying out the warranty and see if there really is an exchange for it."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"DO NOT BUY - you will have problems with Innova cookware like everybody else does and Innova will not do anything about it!!!INNOVA SELLS FAULTY COOKWARE DOESN'T HONOR WARRANTY!!!I would give Innova line of cookware 0 stars if I could because there is absolutely nothing positive about it. When I first got this pot it seemed ok. But after enamel started chipping off (very common problem with Innova cookware, as I later discovered), I contacted customer service and all they told me was:""That would not be covered by the warranty because it does not affect the function of the cookware.""One line, no ""sorry"", ""thank you"" or whatever. Not to mention this ridiculous and dirty way to dishonor warranty.DO NOT BUY or you will be giving your money to thiefs!"
1,An Experiences User,"I am a very experienced user of Innova. Innova is I guess you can say is the parent company of Ultrex which is a line of nonstick cookware.Innova is not know for quality and this product is no different. There is a 25 year warranty on the Ultrex, I had mine for 6 years and the nonstick coating is off. You can return the product for another but yes, you have to pay for the shipping and if your pot is oversized, you have to pay UPS or whomever to make you a box and thats another charge.The customer service is not world class. I had to wait almost 3 months for a replacement. The workmanship is horrible, the product is made in China, however, I've had other things made in China that were of great quality, so I don't know what is up with Innova.I suggest that if you find a product made by Innova, avoid it! Save yourself the aggrevation! This product doesn't deserve 1 star."
1,Dont buy this product - dangerous and should be recalled!,"Dont buy this. The company Innova I dont think even exists anymore. Their customer support never got back to me. My inside enamel started to crack and then suddenly the enamel popped out while I was heating a little oil in it. Thankfully I noticed it or else it might have been injested if I had continued to cook in it. I threw mine in the garbage. I originally bought it at Sears 1 year ago. Horrible, horrible product."
3,Who Will Tell My Brother?,"I think that this book is only ok. It is good because it helps people learn how to stand up for their race, and gain courage. But I did not like the author's style of writing which was in poem form, which made it difficult for me to enjoy the book."
1,Book,"The people who sent this were fast and the book was new. However, this is a depressing book a mom wrote about her kid being picked on. It's biased from a mother's point of view and not uplifting in anyway. If you want to be depressed and think that the world is an aweful place, this is the book for you. Oh, and she keeps noting that her family is part native american. I'm not sure what she's trying to accomplish by this except maybe pointing out that her children are minorities and should be treated differently? She does say that they look white. Who cares? She's trying to make it seem like a racial issue. She's making a bad situation look as bad as she possibly can. A mother trying to heal, the world is so aweful book."
2,"Why were these clips ""banned from television""?",This one has a lot of footage I've already seen from those television specials on Fox. Some of the footage isn't even bannable (if that's a word). Stick with the first one.
3,"Good, but not great.","The first Banned From Television video is still the best in the series. However, Banned From TV 2 still has it's moments, including: a pitbull attack, suicide attempts, car wrecks, and a sex video of Tonya Harding and Jeff Gilooly. Good, but could've been better."
4,Nelson's Complete book of Stories,This book is well organized and has up-to-date illustrationsfor many topics that are relevant today for speakers.I know that we will enjoy this book for many years to come.
1,Mistitled ...,"Very disappointed in this book because it was not what was advertised. It should have been titled ""ultimate CHRISTIAN resource."" If it had, I would not have wasted my money. I agree with another reviewer who says that this book is not something they can use because of its religious nature. I wish I had read that review before because I would not have bought the book. Perhaps it is a good marketing concept to title the book a ""contemporary resource"" ... so as to mislead and increase sales, but instead it has just angered and frustrated this reader and I will avoid this publisher in the future."
2,Weak Clip,"The light itself is great. However, the clip is not very strong and I can't find one single place on my grill that it will clip and stay in place.I have it clipped to an item next to the grill which is not very convenient."
2,Tool sets are great but check the picture to make sure,"I love the way you can grab a set of tools that has a place for everything, go and get the job done, wipe the tools clean and put them away. If there is an empty slot or space I look for and find the tool and my set is complete for the next time I am called out to be Mr. Fix It. Less lost tools. I find the 170 piece set has the best value. It plus a hammer and I am ready to go"
3,Good but not great,"Perhaps it's because I read this novel in translation that I did not find it as compelling as others reviewers have. I finished the novel because I wanted to find out how the protagonist made it to Vienna when the Versailles fantasy began to collapse. But it was a slow go. In places, such as where the protagonist recalls in stunning detail a lengthy conversation between two guards about Marie Antoinette, I felt my crdulity strained that, as one of the queen's courtiers, she wasn't either beaten up or raped by these two guys. In fact, maybe it was the sexlessness of this world--with only the hint of a possible lesbian relationship with Gabrielle de Polignac--that made it finally less than riveting.High points of the novel: the meticulous description of the most minute gradations of rank and the way they constantly underwent change."
3,Slow going.....,"I'm still struggling to finish. It's good and I understand why it has the slow quality of being frozen in a dream--that must have been what it really felt like. Still, this is the third time I've fallen asleep while reading it."
4,Another view of Marie Antoinette's final days at Versailles,"Chantal Thomas has written interesting spin on the events that occurred before and after Bastille Day in France, through the eyes of Marie Antoinette's reader. Yes the story meanders and yes there is some pointless dialog (as other reviewers have mentioned) but I enjoyed reading Thomas's take on what the courtiers and servants must have seen and felt during those last few days of Louis the XVI's reign. I would also recommend ""Abundance"" by Sena Jeter Naslund and the non fiction ""Marie Antoinette, The Last Queen of France"", by Evelene Lever. I had a hard time putting all of these books down."
1,Gorham Melon Bud Stainless Steel Flatware,"Gorham Melon Bud 5-Piece Stainless Steel Flatware Place Setting, Service for 1I have owned this flatware for several years now and I am very disappointed in it. I have 14 place settings and all the serving pieces so I am heavily invested in this set. I liked the fact that it was a versatile style with a good weight, it was comfortable in the hand and it offered a large assortment of serving pieces. However, this set does not hold up well in the dishwasher. You must hand wash and dry this set to keep it looking it's best. Even with hand washing and drying, I still get occasional rust spots and tarnishing and I must polish the pieces every several months or so. For the price paid, this flatware requires much too much care. If you don't want to baby your flatware, look elsewhere."
2,Rust!,I received the full melon bud set for our wedding only 6 months ago. We've noticed rust spots appearing on the knives that will not come off even with soaking and heavy scrubbing. These place settings will be returned. I'd avoid this set and all Gorham flatware in the future to be safe.
2,25 cents of roadtrip pleasure,"I bought this in a bin for 25 cents. It is hard to decide on a star rating...not sure my 2 stars is right. If you are into lattee lingo/hotspots/and retro spaceships you will need this cd. If your jeep air conditioner is broken, you just lost your job but are still going on a summer climbing trip anyway...this cd will also fit right in and prove valuable helping you keep your perspective while wandering dusty desert roads searching for that perfect offwidth. Pretty mellow listening.*note for your info: there is some foul language/concepts in it."
1,A HUGE Waste of Money,"This is the worst collection of DVDs I have ever bought. The Soldiers of Darkness Collection box has images of fighters they want you to think are in one of the DVDs but really aren't included in the bunch. This is a random bunch of movies thrown together with a so not-worth-it-price tag with promotion for the group. Even on the official Wu-Tang Clan website, most of the films in the collection rate far below what they would call 'must-haves'. Actually only two films rate a 4 and those are the two best of the bunch, ""Hell's Wind Staff"" & ""Arhats In Fury"". The movie ""Hidden Darts"" has the worst voiceover I have ever heard and is one of the worst in the box. It sounds as if someone recorded their lines in a basement. It rates a 1 on their website, so why would they include such a bad movie? The group is better at making music then they are at suggesting movies for classic kung-fu fans."
5,The Wild World of Wu Tang!!!!,"This is a whole lot of value for the money!The materials range from a documentary on the Wu Tang Clan to chinese kung fu films to pro wrestling to low budget blaxploitation.There's something for all!The whole package is budget since they are giving so many things for a low price but beyond that it's fine.To buy these films and items individually would cost hundreds of dollars so no complaints.This will take you at least a whole weekend if not more to watch.Also included is a great interview with the late ODB and some other WTC members.Some great films including Escape from Brothel,Fatal Flying Guillotine and Undaunted Wu Tang are well worth the price alone."
5,great value,I don't understand more than a few words of french but it doesn't matter.I love Piaf's voice and music and this really is a wonderful collection of her best. I've enjoyed this so much I purchased another and sent to my friend who is enjoying it as much as I.
2,Edith Piaf: Eternelle,"The singing was too brassy, too strident. Not the Edith Piaf I remember on a 33l/3 record I bought in the l960s."
2,"not the best of her , but still edith....",songs in this cd not good sound and not very appealing.the company should have included newest versions or better selection .I don't even listen anymore any of this cd....
5,"Piaf, the Soul of France",This is an excellent quality recording of some of the most deeply touching music to come out of post war France.There is simply no voice like Piaf's.
2,Poor quality production,"The songs that are represnted are a very good assortment of EPs work. But the quality of the reproduction is uneven, volume levels change frequently and significnatly from track to track so that listening cannot be done in a manner that is comformatble or enjoyable."
5,Atmosphere,"A good friend told me about Edith Piaf a few weeks ago and said she was sort of the Frank Sinatra of France. I bought this CD and have it playing in the lobby of my law office (and my car). It creates a great and relaxing atmosphere and everyone likes it. Now that I'm finally tuned in to this great and beautifully stylizing singer, I'm starting to notice her everywhere -- most recently, in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" she was being played over the loudspeakers in a French town. The soldiers paused and the fellow who spoke French explained to the others the song of sad lament. She was and is perfect."
5,Eternelle: The Best of Edith Piaf,"Well titled. I have three Edith Piaf's CD's and this is unquestionably the best. Great song selection - there was only one that I wouldn't put on my Ipod.A must selection if you don't already have it and if you only like a 'little' of Edith Piaf's work, this is the one to own."
5,Terrific Piaf songs,"Edith Piaf's voice is like a fine liqueur, if you are unfamiliar with it, you may have to acquire a taste for it. She can be perceived as strident and shrill by those not knowing about her, but to fans like myself, she sings beautifully and with heartfelt emotion. Most of her classics are on this CD, including ""La Vie en Rose"" and ""Milord,"" and to this day her songs are played, for example on the Brazilian soap opera ""Insensato Coracao"" which is on TV now. I feel a connection to Piaf as she and I are birthday twins (Dec. 19, different year) and I feel so blessed to have avoided extreme suffering as she did in her life, and which comes out in her songs ala Judy Garland's. Listen to this CD with a loved one and a nice bottle of wine, or romantic dinner, to be transported to Paris in spirit."
5,Great selection of songs,"This c.d. is great. You may not find all of the songs that are listed on other albums. But the sounds is great. Edith's voice carries itself well on this album. I feel like I am truly in the audience, listening to her live."
5,Great Music !!,Great choice of Piaf classics. Good variety.Clear recording...sounds like she is right with you. Love it!
4,Excelent voice of this french woman,Even thoug the songs are in french language those capture completely the senses....I think it is the perfect combination of woman singing voice and french language.....great
4,could be too small,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!a little small though not for sportz gamz.intec and madkatz are the best third-party brands for memory cards out there.IF it is TOO SmaLLGET THE 16MB MEMORY CARD FROM INTEC ON AMAZON FOR AROUND 5 AND A HALF bUCks!!!!!!! only corrupted once then it worked perfectly had it for more than 2 years and i use it the most of all my memory cards.
1,Frustratingly brief presentation,"While the book presents numerous types of agricultural buildings from all over the U.S., it doesn't go into any sort of detail about any of them, making it of limited reference use."
4,If I had only known.....,This field guide has what I consider to be soso black and white photos and drawings of each type of barn and supporting structures. If you are looking for accurate information on a style of barn and where it may be located this is the book for you. I would perfer better quality photo's and some color. Rather boring presentation!
5,Barn buffs bonanza,"If you like a barns and or books on the subject this is a gem. History, pictures, other complimentary structures simple yet plenty of info not the size of a coffee table but with more info than most coffee table books. More educational than picture book but a serious addition to either farm or barn library. Perfect for novice but strong enough to impress a long timer like myself. Happy reading!"
5,Not What I Expected....KUDOS!,"I have loved the Spice Girls since they first came out but I was never really a big fan of ""Ginger"". So when she left I was really happy. Then I heard her first single ""Look At Me"" and kinda liked it but because of the bad reviews, I didn't bother to buy it. Long story short, when I heard ""Ride It"" and ""Desire"", I just had to have this album. I am so glad that I went broke buying it lol cause it is worth it. I'm not going to go through the album track by track cause I just don't feel like it. The whole album reminds me of a cross between something of a Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue. Now I'm not saying that Geri is some great singer cause we all know she isn't but she's singing to her capability and not over doing it. Her voice for once sounds smooth and trained and very mature. I congratulate Ms. Halliwell for a job well done! Geri and Melanie C are the only Spice Girls to get it right!"
2,Not the best....,"I have been fan of Spice Girls for years. I even listen to their solo album. But the new album of Geri Halliwell is not very good. The ONLY song that i think it's okay is ""Ride It"", the others are not very good. If you're willing to buy it, i suggest you buy Geri's previous album, such as ""Scream If You Wanna Go Faster""."
1,Beware copy control!!!,"I just received my copy of this album and found that it is copy controlled and therefore will not play in my car CD player! Furthermore Amazon does not mention this fact anywhere on this sales page and this is now the second CD I have ordered through them with this problem. If you don't have a car CD or don't plan to use it in your car then feel free to buy it, but consider yourself warned. I'm furious, not just because I spent good money on a product that will not work, and that my retailer (Amazon) did not see fit to warn me, but because I love Geri and will now have to wait until the weekend when I am near a land based CD unit to hear it."
2,Not a good return...,"I love Geri Halliwell just because of the Spice Girls but I have to admit she's not a good singer at all, but I think ""Schizophonic"" and ""Scream If You Wanna Go Faster"" both were great. I cannot say same thing about this one, cause the only good song is ""Ride it"". And if you ask me about the graphic design, photos, printing, etc... IT SUCKS! Better go and buy her previous albums :/"
4,"Geri is my ""Passion""!","I LOVE Geri Halliwell! and have been a huge fan of hers for years now. I love everything about her and her unique talented voice as well. This album is a good pop album. But my ultimate favorite track on the album and not to mention personally my favorite song ever is ""Let Me Love You More"", it's just a masterpiece song and wonderful to listen to. I highly recommend this album, however the reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because some of the lyrics to a few of the songs are somewhat ""campy"" I guess you can say. This is album is still great but I think Geri can write much more better and meaningful lyrics as well. I really hope she comes out with a fifth album sometime soon in the near future, I can't get enough of her and will always love her music! Plus I believe that Geri has had the most successful career out of the Spice Girls group. As well as the only one's solo career that I admire and enjoy listening to."
5,Passion is GREAT!!!!,"Geri's 3rd. album is the best of all!She really has done a great job with this romantic style album. ll songs are great, specially Desire, Feel the fear, Superstar, Ride it, Let me love you more & Don't get any better."
2,Example of mis-casting,"The film is set in a middle/working class area of England and is a quite depressingly realistic portrayal of family life.I am not giving anything away by saying the film is almost all about whether or not her husband is a serial killer called the hawk. If your english you will see a lot of familiar faces from the smallscreen, but If you like Helen Mirren watching her play a dreary neurotic housewife isnt much fun."
2,"Fannypack's CD ""See You Next Tuesday""",The CD has three catchy songs--I only bought it because I liked the opening song to an Adam Sandler movie I saw last year (which was on this CD). It's an okay CD.
2,Details but no Delivery,"If you are looking for every detail known to modern man regarding all of the OTHER movies Mel Gibson ever starred in or directed, this is the book for you. If you are looking for true insight into The Passion, just skip to the last few pages and you will still be disappointed. I, too, am ashamed to say I spent a good deal of time wading through all of the details in the bulk of this book, hoping to get to the point. Very disappointing."
2,Rather Gossipy Story on Mel Gibson's Life Up Until 1999.,"I found this book in a discount book section and although it did add to my knowledge about Mel Gibson's early life and behind the scenes of some of his movies, I couldn't help but notice that a lot of the story seemed to be in the style of the gossip press.I'm not disputing the facts, since I have no knowledge really at all about Mel Gibson, but the book seemed to concentrate a little too much on all the gory details! I think I would enjoy a more balanced view of Gibson and his life instead of this one that seemingly hovers mostly around the negative."
1,mmmmmmmmmmmm chicken supper !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i really did think that the book was very very biased . obviously it was bound to be one sided "" oh! we're soooo poor and oppressed"". what i fail to see is that you beleive to be so rightious. you say there is a war, but that his death was caused by his/your oppression. even if there was a war it is acceptable to say that there will be fatalities."
4,old-style punk rock & roll,"It is uncanny how much this band sounds like a punked-up version of the Animals. The guitars are fuzzy, the vocals are strained, the cymbals are tinny, and the bass is walking all over the place. i can't imagine anybody driving the speed limit while listening to this cd. If you can find it, get this album. If you can see the band live, even better."
2,worked great...for a while,Well it worked fine for printing labels in our lab...however after about a year the thermal printer just stopped working. We have several other instruments with thermal printers and I have never seen one die before.
5,Great for printing stamps and labels,I've been using this for 2 years now. It's been happily chugging along. No problems.If you're looking for a scale go go along with it I'd recommend the USPS Postal Scale which is $65 at the time of this writing and it'll weigh up to 30lbs. Other options for scales weight 5-10lbs at $80+. If you're searching Amazon you'll want to search on 'usb postal scale' as it won't come up under 'USPS Postal Scale'.
2,Total Ripoff !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This turns out to be nothing more than a VERY expensive stamp machine! At 13 cents EXTRA per stamp, when you factor in the cost of the labels, it is a total waste of money. I would rather run to the post office and use the stamp machine to buy 100 stamps and save 13 bucks. There is never a line at the stamp machine so it is no big deal. As for shipping labels, you can only ship items under 1 pound UNLESS of course you join one of their monthly premium plans or a minimum of $10 a month. So basically you end up paying just as much or more than you would with a postage meter. I personally will be returning this back to the store."
4,easy setup but pricey,"Have had several Dymo labelwriters before, but purchased this for the ability to print stamps without changing the labels. Setup was smooth, labelprinting is easy, Dymostamps setup smooth. BUT...the cost of a roll of labels added to the postage ends up costing .51 per letter, a bit pricey if you're sending a lot. However, I find it a great convenience to be able to send something immediately without having to go to the Post Office or hunt for a stamp. If I was using this in a business it would be too expensive."
4,Reliable but jams up occassinally,"We use this in a commercial environment and it prints well. The labels jam about once a week though and often shift off to the right. This requires us to remove the front panel which isnt too hard, but it should be made easier to clear such jams.Quite satisfied though. Its fast, and has a programmable SDK which is important for integration with our system. Also has included software which is flexible."
1,Not as easy to use as advertised,"I purchased this in order to try on-line postage/stamps. Their claim is an ""easy one step set-up."" It is far from that. When called for assistance, Dymo points fingers a the postage company and the postage company points fingers at Dymo for the inability of the equipment to work. No one will help with the problem so I have a Twin Turbo paper weight."
5,Love this gadget!,"I had been wanting one of these for a while and saw a good price on Amazon. Love it! I now print my stamps on this, my file labels, and address labels for packages. This all looks very professional for a small business. Very worth the price."
1,Not worth it at all.,"I was hoping to use this to help my business along. Instead, it's given me more headaches than I know what to do with. My mac didn't even recognize the first one, so I contacted Dymo about it. They immediately issued a RMA and sent me a new one. The new one was recognized right away and I was able to print. Well, when I tried to print postage, the stamps jammed. It happens, so I opened the case to take care of the jam and when I pulled the lever down to release them, it twisted. It would not twist back. The other side did the same.It's very cheaply made and I don't know how anyone else is able to work with these without breaking them. Needless to say, I'm returning the second one and looking for alternatives."
1,Intel Powered Mac? - forget Dymo printers,"Dymo's website has a software download for Intel power Macs - this software does not work at all - even though the Mac ""sees"" the Dymo sitting on a USB port it cannot print to it - after a friendly geek struggled with it for the better part of a hour it finally decided to print labels - even the geek does not know what he did to make it print - so - if it goes down - it goes to my physical trash bin - get with it DYMO - Macs are taking over the computer world"
4,Dymo LabelWriter,"Works perfectly on a Windows 2000 XP platform. Software is very good and easy to use but a few minor improvements would be welcome. For example an easier way to reorganize the address templetes to separate US and Overseas addresses....in Europe the last name is put first and the zip is before the city...this would have saved me a lot of time. A filter to separate the addresses into Family/Business/Friends/etc. would also be very welcome.A word of warning if you're planning to use this for stamp-printing. It works GREAT and it will save me a lot of time but you're going to pay a premium of about 7 cents per stamp which is just fine with me but may not be worthwhile to a lot of people.The quality and ease of printing is excellent. The downloadable, up-to-date postage rates is wonderful (it'll save me a lot of overpostage).Overall, an excellent product whose software is very good but in need of a few minor ""twicks"""
5,The Gold Standard of Catullus Texts,"Forsyth is by far the best text I have ever used for teaching Catullus. Her notes are, in a word, superb. Her perspective combines impeccable scholarship and lucid analysis with a unique charm and wit that provides a wonderful extension of the spirit of the poet himself. This is no turgid tome; it is alive and fun to read. Forsyth does not shy away from the sexual poems; she discusses them with keen insight into the sexual practices of the ancient world. This book, together with Wiseman's Catullus and his World, is all you need to teach Catullus."
5,Attractive and well-designed,"We have the Vinturi wine aerator (Amazon) which works great when opening a bottle of red is a last minute decision. But we wanted something that would present itself well at the dinner table or bar when we had the time to properly decant the wine.The Wine Enthusiast Vivid Decanter is a very attractive work of glass and it holds the typical 750 ml bottle of wine to a level where the maximum surface area is exposed to the air.I can understand other reviewers' comments that it could be difficult to pour, but I just watched what I was doing, and didn't have any problems from the very first pour right up until the last."
2,"Updated: Puchased June, Broken October","Just an update-- normal use and broken in less than 4 months. Avoid.<OLD>This is a decent decanter for the price. Lots of people are complaining about pouring the last glass-- they are spilling or finding it awkward becasue they are doing it wrong!The correct technique for pouring will fix the ""problem."" Most people grab the decanter with their thumb on the top side of the neck like they are grabbing a broom or hockey stick. The correct way to pour is by simply turning your hand over with your thumb on the bottom side of the decanter's neck, then lifting and pouring.It takes some getting used to, but you'll spill a lot less."
4,Almost perfect and still a good value,"I purchased this decanter (here on Amazon) and wanted to modify my review so I cancelled it, thinking that I could start the process over. I could not.So this review IS from a very recent purchase. The bottom is not flat and it rocks a little. They do not grind the bottom flat. Otherwise, I am happy with the purchase and not unhappy enough to return it. It is a large, pretty piece of glass! The mouth/neck is large. More so than I thought from the picture. It is a very ""manly"" size and weight decanter. One feature is that it is large enough to fit the neck of an average bottle in the spout to drain completely and the bottle shoulder acts as a stopper. A large avacado is also a good fit! The free book - Wine Enthusiast Wine Guide and magazine was a nice bonus!"
2,Would have loved to use it but...,"I bought this wine decanter it came it its own box with the entire top smashed and crushed. It was so badly wrapped, I threw it in the bin as I had no easy way to return it. I am sure its a fantastic decanter..................."
4,Look No Further,"After an exhausting search for the right decanter for us, this one came out on top. The sizr is perfect. An entire 750ml bottle comes up to the widest part of the bottom, allowing maximum surface area for air. It's light weight without feeling flimsy. It doesn't feel like it'll break in yout hands. It is a little akward pouring the last bit of wine, but that's no big deal. We also ordered the Wine Enthusiest drying stand after our first washing. Would highly recommend both items."
4,Has lots of good movie production info,"This is like a movie critics handbook to Marx Brothers movies. There's a lot of production detail and historical data. But if you really want the meat and potatoes of everything Marx Brothers, then you simply must read Harpo Speaks. Harpo Speaks has everything and more. Don't leave this planet until you have read Harpo Speaks."
1,what a disappointment,"I got this thinking it would save me time, but it only rewinds ONE disc at a time!!! That is not help at all. I need a magazine disc rewinder or a turntable type rewinder so I can do several at one time. My life is busy and I need to get them done fast."
1,Beware!!! Does not work on Blu-rays!!!,"I have been using this product for awhile. As the other reviewers said, it works great on CDs and standard def DVDs but, alas, not blu-rays. I called tech support and they said they would update the firmware. I'm still waiting :("
4,finally they did it,I was waiting so long for this i used to have to rewind all my DVDs by hand(you know placing the DVD on my finger and spinning it counterclockwise) now all i have to do is place it in this wonderful device and my DVDs are rewound in seconds. i gave it 4 stars because it would be nice if it could fast foreword as well.
4,"MP3's, Please!","I've enjoyed this for my various DVD's and CD's (yes, I am also sad about the compatibility issue with Blu-Ray). I'd love to see a USB port to rewind my MP3's as well. Currently, I keep one at the office and one at home just so I don't have to wait! I actually tried it in the car, but it seems to skip on occasion, which is a real bummer! Otherwise, it's a winner through-and-through!"
3,Too Tight,"Holster is of fine construction and heavy duty. I use it for my G19 and it snaps on and off very quickly. The gripe I have is it is VERY tight. So tight that even adjusting the screw to the loosest possible position will produce a situation where you CANNOT draw the weapon. After tireless hours of breaking it in, I'm finally at the point it will draw, but only if I use my left hand to hold the holster while I draw with my right. I expect that after more use it may be acceptable, but for now it is not."
3,big star but boring author.,the book was slow moving and very boring the author made Grant Hill's life look bad. There was times when I almost wanted to stop reading the book. the book focused mainly on Grant Hill's coaching career. The book didn't talk much about his childhood or his NBA career. The author could have made the book a little longer by be more descriptive and not skipping threw his whole entire life. I don't really think the author really knew alot about Grant Hill.
2,Bleh,"This book needs to be edited, horribly. There are many grammatical errors along with some words being completely left out. Not to mention, she has a tendency to jump back and forth, which is VERY confusing. When I am reading about how a king is defending his country against the Danes, I don't want the story to all of the sudden change into a story about when he is in hiding! (I'm only on page 72 and I'm already annoyed) After reading some of the other reviews, I would advise you NOT use this book for a paper, find another source. I am reading this book for fun and after I am done I am going to find another book by a more reputable historian."
4,Almost New,"Book arrived with dented edge on front cover and DJ was stetched a bit. I could not give it 5 stars, unfortunately, because it was described as ""New"". Better described as ""Like New."""
3,Missing maps (maddening),"This is a lively, well-written history. But if you're not familiar with British geography, well, you're lost. For example, referring to roads built by the Romans, Ms. Fraser writes:""Watling Street ran from Dover (Dubrae) to London and then via St Albans to Wroxeter (Viroconium) on the Welsh border. Although a branch was pushed south to Caerleon just north of Newport, and another branch carried on east to Carnarvon, the principal road continued north to Chester and then crossed over to York.""Readers shouldn't have to Google ""britain map"" to find out where these places are."
4,Comprehensive narrative; lacks footnotes,"This book was an enjoyable read, covering the history of Britain (including Scotland and Ireland) from Roman times through the present day. Almost every chapter covers the reign of an English king or queen. The book is written in a conversational style, which made the nearly 800 pages of text fly along. Interesting drawings, paintings, and photographs are interspersed within the text. Family trees included at the end make it easier to follow the relationships and intrigues among the various rulers. Two things would have improved the book: the inclusion of likenesses of all the kings and queens instead of limiting them to a select few, and the inclusion footnotes tying the text to the original sources. (There is an extensive list of references, but it is just not feasible to find the source of a particular statement from such a list.)"
4,Great introduction,"This book feels kind of like a textbook, but one of the interesting ones that you enjoyed reading when you were in school. Pick it up if you are looking for a book you can read a few pages every night."
5,Britain from Ancient Times to Today,"Britain is one of the countries most responsible for making the modern world what it is today, and Rebecca Fraser covers the history of that great nation from Roman times to the early twenty-first century in ""The Story of Britain"".The author stresses the strong commitment on the part of the British people to personal liberty, exemplified by the adoption almost eight centuries ago of the Magna Carta, which set up the principle of the rule of law that is still the foundation of the justice system of the Anglosphere today.Fraser manages to cover adequately two thousand years of monarchs, wars, laws, literature, prime ministers, religious movements, technological advances, and social trends in less than 800 pages--the coverage of the English Civil War is especially compelling. At the end of the book, there are tables of the monarchs and prime ministers of the country. This is a very good one-volume history of one of the world's most important nations."
4,HBO comes through,"This is one of the better HBO productions to make it to video. Drama, ethics, and history all combine into an excellent movie with tremendous acting. This is a story that should not be forgotten."
3,Interesting Movie,"A very interesting movie. It is thought provoking and is well made. Not my usual type of movie, but I enjoyed watching it a few times."
5,Gift,A friend of mine needed this for nursing. She needed it asap. Thanks for the prompt service :) Very pleased
3,Good.,I particularly enjoyed the dance scenes and the doctors were very credible. The period covered was lengthy and just occasionally the time lines were a little blurred.
4,A favorite of mine for many years.,"This movie is very light and refreshing, like a cold can of Fresca. Keep your eyes open for a ""cameo"" by the dude who playes Skinner on X-Files."
3,Funny Movie,"As a teenager, I really got a kick out of watching Three O' Clock High and decided to purchase the DVD from Columbia House. Now, I've watched Three O' Clock High several times as an teenager and was really upset to find scenes that I'd remembered from the movie missing. In fact, there are a few scenes deleted from the movie's original version which is why I'm only giving the movie a three star rating. Had the movie been released on DVD without deleted scenes, I would have giving the movie five stars, which it truly deserves."
3,One of those movies...,"..where it depends on how you view the world. I saw this movie in the eighth grade, and because I was such a scared individual when it came to people picking on me and threatening me, this movie scared me to death about going to high school, and I promised not to wathc it again until AFTER high school. All ""taking to heart"" aside. It is rather cheesy. I have never heard of a kid knocking out a police officer and the other one backing off. I would've had my gun drawn, thank you. However it does portray every not-so-tough high school kid's fear; of the bully(ies)."
1,"Boring, better off renting something else","I rate this movie only 1 star because as I can remember back when I was about 8 (when I saw this film) it was not very clever. It's basic premise is about a guy who ends up agitating the high school bully and he decides that rather than back down he's going to confront the school bully outside the high school building at 3 O'clock in the afternoon in the school parking lot.As the day progresses, he gets more anxious and at the same time, more confident, if memory serves me correctly and everyone encourages him to fight.Very boring! I wouldn't buy, much less, rent this film because you're better off buying or renting another movie."
5,Good Purchase,"Dvd quality and service was great - I ordered this as a surprise for my husband who remembers this movie from years ago, and we caught the very end of it on TV a few weeks ago (of course they didn't plan to show it again). So I decided to order it for him online, it came in right away and played gr8, was a swell surprise and made for a good movie night! The movie is a teen bopper classic about a guy who spends all day at school trying to avoid getting beat up by the world's oldest bully... recommend to anyone for a Saturday afternoon vegg out!"
5,One of my favorites.,"A cult classic. Joanou does an excellent job on this one. Ahead of it's time, this movie has great camera angles and cinematography. Hilarious flick will have you rolling on the floor. The soundtrack is also good(remember Tangerine Dream?) One of Casey Siemaszko's leading roles fits him perfectly. I recommend this movie to all."
5,the SOUL of FRANCE,"Edith's SOUL comes pouring out with each note! She takes you WITH her into the HEART of PARIS- Like magnificent wine, it goes THROUGH you to the SOUL- MEMORABLE!!!!!!"
2,Sizes Run Small,"We bought this as a Halloween costume for my average size three year old. It was so short in the arms and legs, and very tight. It seems like it was more of a size 1-2 than 2-4. My son wanted to wear it anyway, because he had his heart set on being a dalmatian and it was too close to Halloween to find another anywhere. We ended up putting black long sleeve shirt and pants on under the costume. The other problem we had with this costume is that the inside is very rough and itchy. My son refused to keep the hood part pulled up on his head because he complained of how itchy it was."
1,Not Dido,"This is some sort of tribute album and not really Dido, which you would know if Amazon had audio samples. It's also ridiculously expensive. I'd skip it."
4,Richa Sharma is a powerful singer,"Richa Sharma did a track, or part of a track, in the movie ""Om Shanti Om"" and I just loved it. A great and powerful voice. I think my only objection to ""Winds of Rajasthan"" is that her accompaniment on the CD is excessively polished. The accompaniment is, I suppose, faultlessly perfect and quite beautiful, but I think I would have preferred to have heard her ""a cappella."" With a voice like hers, she didn't need accompaniment."
2,Missed opportunity,"I too was gravely disappointed by the sound quality. I owned many of these tracks on the Everest label years ago. In fact, I'm glad I kept those LPs because I cannot find a CD reissue that can beat them for sound quality, particularly on the sessions he did with Charlie Parker. Now, documentation--that's a different matter. But here, Proper even cut off the first two notes of Dizzy's intro to ""Blue and Boogie."" That's just plain shoddy, and frankly unlistenable. It was really a let down, after being so excited to finally see the Dizzy/Parker sides (Shaw 'Nuff, etc.) on one set, only to hear what they had done to them."
4,An important work,"All in all, I think the book was pretty dense, but it challenged some long-held evangelical assumptions that must be reformed for the future. This is an important book that helps to make evangelical thought more conversant with some of the major contributions in 20th century theology. It serves to help conservative christians engage other disciplines, as well as helping us to understand our faith in philosophical categories that more closely correlate to the Biblical presentation of a dynamic transformative Triune God."
3,"interesting, but...","As the previous reviewer (who happens to have been Shults' teaching assistant, and who therefore may be more than a bit biased) stated, Shults has written an interesting and timely book. It is, however, very dense--perhaps for economy's sake, Shults frequently does not define complex theological terms, and the readability of the book ultimately suffers. While a student of theology will find it an interesting perspective, I would not readily recommend it to the average layperson."
1,Very Disappointing,This cd collection was a very big disappointment.It in no way captures the wonderful spirit of the original animation.I do not recommend this music. It is very sterile and boring.Stay far away.
5,Great hot 20s Chicago Jazz,"Spirited hot jazz from 1920s Chicago- ""Mojo Strut"" and ""Washboard Wiggles"" are worth the price of admission. Parham's music deserves a wider audience."
3,I really like this monitor but...,"After a few months a small ""dark"" spot the size of a thumb print appeared near the upper left corner. It slowly began to spead to the size of a coffee mug. Then the screen around its color seemed to fade and there was tempory burn in when i play games ( i use it as a Computer Monitor and watch TV thru a Video Card.)I bought it from Sears and paid extra for a service plan, hopefully it will be fixed or replaced soon.It was a really handy duel purposed device that saved tons of space and looked great too.DVI inputs rock."
3,Does the job but a little flimsier than I expected,"I have fixed (bolted on) wrought iron curtain rods so i needed open rings to be able to attach them. This works and are the only ones I've seen, but they are fairly delicate and one broke while I was hanging it. Still though, for functionality, i would buy it again."
2,not very strong,These clips are very flimsy. Not very strong. Was not what I expected. Would not buy again. Quite dissapointedand needed many more than I got.
5,A fantastic tool for learning how to identify ducks,"Whether you are new to duck hunting or you have hunted for years, you know that you need to identify what you are shooting before you shoot it. That can be quite challenging at times even for the most experienced hunters. This book is an outstanding resource for aiding you on identifying waterfowl. If it's not hunting season then leave the book on your coffee table. It is full of beautiful photographs and in our household has become quite a conversation piece."
5,Fun read,I love this series. Her insight into human behaviour is always right on. Fun read with characters you love to revisit with each book. Would also recommend her other series.
5,30 on Top 30 on the bottom,"Needless to say, I was not disappointed. In the genre of BDSM there are some very extreemly fantastical tales out there. This is not one of them. Having a selection of 60 tales to chose from, pick your favorite. However you should be warned that this book has a specific theme, that is to say, the Tops are all male and the bottoms are all female. If that is not to your taste, this is not worth spending the money on. If you're more into vanilla erotica, why are you even reading this? Violence is the theme of this anthology and shocking as it may be to new comers to the genre, the women bottoms in these stories love it.This collection of anthology is the best I have found so far. The narratives actually have literary style which is not always the case in most eroticas. This is one of those books that you'll either love or hate. In my case, it was one of the best books I bought in the genre to date."
2,More vanilla than D's related,"To be honest the stories within this book are very basic, they dont give much detail, nor is there anything other than a bit of spanking, and light bondage described.Maybe i've become more hardcore but, in all honesty the stories to me were just very boring and vanilla. If your just buying it to get the free super saver shipping then it might be worth your time but there are plenty of other books that are in many ways worth your money more than this one....~meticulous~"
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"I love this book. I like seeing things from both sides and the stories are just fantastic. Some beginners, amateurs, and pros stories combined, which makes the idea of 'how it works' easy to grasp. For any level of kink your into you can find something in here to read."
3,not a bad book for a novice,"ThIs book isn't bad. At times shocking and hot. However, most of the stories don't really get your toes to curl. I do like how many of the authors have some involvement in the lifestyle, it makes the stories feel real."
2,Never Judge A book By It's Cover,This book was boring at best. I read some of the stories & nothing caught my interest as being entertaining. I ended up returning the book.
1,Should have made it clearer.,The book was not what i was expecting and found that i had just wasted my money. I thought it was just a general bondage but this is way weird. I wish I could get my money back to put on a book that matched the description.
2,Blu-ray Fake Widescreen,"I have seen caps from identical scenes of a full screen dvd and the wide screen blu ray. Yes the bluray is really nice and clear, but they have just cut the top and bottom off of the full screen 1.33:1 film negative. Bad luck for those that got it for Mary Tamm's ""extremely rare"" scenes.I urge everyone to email olive films and demand a full screen version be on the disk as well. Many dvd's have both versions. (full screen and overmasked widescreen)I am a firm believer in ""Personal Choice""."
1,Tales That Witness Madness,"A 1970's movie but it doesn't seem that way,due to the fact it's not as scary as movies from this period, Donald Pleasence is the only reason worth watching as well as Joan Collins(boobshot by the way)and Kim Novak. Other than that the movie seems a Fairy tale that is not scary at all and quite boring."
4,Am an Amicus and Hammer completist,"Until some months ago , when i streamed this fun little anthology , i had forgotten it even existed . I LOVE all the horror anthology pictures made by both Amicus and Hammer studios . Agreed , some are better than others and several titles have quite modest charms to recommend them . With this release , the United States has only the wonderful DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS yet to be released on dvd/bd in our region 1 format . These various films are seldom actually very scary by today's standards . They have history , assorted constaints , casts , writers , directors and so forth distilled into each delightful time capsule though . If retro horror fun IS your cup of tea ?"
5,One of the last great horror anthologys made!,This is typical british horror from late 70's and if you like hammerhorror and british hammer house tv series you'll love this. the storiesare well written directed and acted. Joan Collins is in the best abouta tree her husband brings inside the house and it's evil! of course!
4,Fantastic beginners book,"This is definately a fantastic book for beginners looking at starting this craft. The book gives you a clear description of the tools you should look at obtaining, then with an embroidery hoop I completed my first piece in two evenings and it looks great! It doesn't have a lot of designs, but has all the basic stitches (step by step) and plenty of inspiration. One design is worked in three different colour combinations and stitch styles giving you all the background you need to start off with Crewel Embroidery."
4,Very Good Primer for Crewel Embroidery,"Very Good Primer for Crewel Embroidery with progressive projects introducing new stitches with each section. I have a number of years of experience with sewing and have dabbled with embroidery on a small scale - mostly just outline type stitches. Wanting to expand into crewel work, I was looking for a book that would allow me to progress with some insight and found just that in this book. Jane's turn of a phrase is a bit quirky for an American reader - I find her charming and understood her well. She has a nice writing and teaching style and is certainly very knowledgable and talented. I'm very satisfied with the purchase of this book and believe a new ""stitcher"" will be able to follow and learn."
5,Florida mammals manual,"We love this series of Florida books and own them all. As recent transpants to Florida, we appreciate the ease of determining exactly what critter we are looking at and what it's characteristics are. It is a huge help in determining which animals, big or small, that we have seen while hiking, biking, kayaking, etc. Easy to find the animal you want with the big colorful photos. Lots of useful info."
3,heat shield is a separate item .not supplied as shown in image,AC delco fan motor p/n 15-80205 does NOT come with the heat shield as shown in the image/// I found this out after ordering 15-80205 and not getting the heat shield. Some research on my part showed that the heat shield is no longer supplied with this part number. Heat shield p/n is 52491784 and is only available from GM /Cadillac dealers for $9.33..if you have a heat shield now...do not destroy it.... they appear to be rare items.
3,Not a fan!,"I love the sun lab tanning lotion but this!!!! HORRIBLE !I mean, maybe it's good if you apply it then rub it in but I thought it was likeeasy as in - just spray it and leave it !!The Sephora self-tanning spray is much better, it doesn't come out so awkwardly and weirdn doesn't require rubbing in at all.This was a real disappointment."
4,FUN WITHOUT THE SUN,"Sun goes on easy and dries fast, for a quick tan before going out for the day or a quick tan before going out for the evening."
5,A finishing touch to a good tan,"I often use this product after tanning lotion applications. Like the lotion, it is pleasant in smell and does a good shop of touch- up and fill in. Easy to see application, it is easy to apply. I saved several dollars by ordering online rather from a retailer. I plan to shop again."
3,Beautiful color but WHAT A MESS!!!,"I found this in Bed Bath and Beyond and decided to give it a try.DO NOT spray this in an open room. Go outside or in a shower stall. It splatters, A LOT and you have no choice but to rub it in. I had nothing around so I had to use my hands. I've been scrubbing my hands for the past couple hours to clean them. I keep checking for splatters I missed (on the back of legs, arms, back) and had to scrub a few out. I just touched up by spraying on a make up sponge and applying. I really hope it doesn't look streaky in a few hours! I'm kinda sitting here panicking waiting to see what the end result will be. I probably won't use it again because it's just such a mess applying it. I have a back up can of Loreal's airbrush and I'll go back to that. Never had a problem and probably shouldn't have tried switching in the first place."
1,Horrible If You Are Pale To Begin With,"First off, if you are pale with NO base tan at all then you should rethink buying this product. I am pale with dark hair and I tried this only to find that it looked horribly fake and orange. For starters, it doesn't come out of the bottle in an even spray. It comes out in splotches and you end up having to rub it in. It smells ok but it does come off easy in the shower and onto clothing. I was so horrified at how orange I looked that I couldn't leave my house until it was all gone. I just hated this product. If you have a decent base tan then you might be able to use it and it look ok. I just didn't like it at all and I'll never buy it again."
3,Great product while it worked,"This is my second Dymo label printer, and replaced the label printer that quit working after about 1 year of light use. I didn't mind too much, because I wanted the dual label/tape function.While it worked, it was fantastic - one of the handiest office machines I've owned, and I would have given it 5 stars if it was more reliable. The tape function still works, but labels no longer feed. There are no jams or anything, so maybe the feed motor burned out. It's got a 2 year warranty, so when I get time I'll send it in."
2,As gay as the day is long....,"Not knowing this is a gay movie, my friends and I rented this flick for a beer and movie night. Now, we've watched some BAD movies (check out Scorpio Maximus). Surge of Power was cheesey enough that we were able to laugh at it the entire way through. This movie can be funny if you don't mind laughing through one long gay joke."
1,AWFUL/ZERO STARS,"Misleading. Boring. Thought it would be a fun movie for the family. Terrible acting,lousy dialogue, and directing. Social interactions only between men. No females other than a bit part with Nichelle Nichols. The DVD cover was quite misleading. I wish I could get my money back. What a disappointment."
1,Comic book fans will not be amused.....,"This is a really bad movie and it sure pokes fun at comic book fans, speaking as one, I find this movie stupid, insulting, and hope the film company that made it, went out of business."
1,"Good band, bad CD","I just bought this new from HMV and tried to play it in my car. After a few minutes it degrades into scrambled garbage. I took the disk out and it was perfect and no scratches. When I got home I put it in my stereo, same thing. Then I put it into my computer and it wants to install some player. F#@K THAT!"
5,"End of 2008, STILL GOING!","I am writing to you on my Vaio PCG-FRV25. Yessiree. Bought it right when they were available over 5 years ago, and it is astounding to me that the processing speed keeps up with all my work to this day.I dumped an entire glass of milk on this thing back in Ought Five. Zapped the keyboard. One inexpensive replacement keyboard later, I was back to illegally downloading music off LimeWire.Of course that ""adequate"" 40 Gig hard drive is full, but my 300 Gig G-Drive Q is the perfect dumping ground for the memories we've shared.Ah well. Good times, Sony. Good times.Never did use that memory stick."
4,An amazing piece of technology and craftsmanship,"I looked at the Dell, great price but I didn't like it's looks. It was too ""blue"". The Compaq was too whimpy in power and their customer service sucks at Hewlitt-Packard. And Gateway is too expensive for their lap tops. I wasn;t about to pay 2 thousand bucks....Sony has always been a name brand best seller in the line-up of electronics. I can hook up my Sony digital camera to my lap top, and then I can print stunning pictures from my lap top to my photo printer. So basically this lap top is a desk top replacement that serves a variety of applications.The BEST thing about this lap top is this... I am in college and live in a tiny dorm room. So this lap top is great for watching dvds and movies. No more dvd player and wires hooked up to the tv set. Finally, this lap top is great because I can download my music, and burn a cd which I can then pop into my cd player in my car and cruise on down the road!A smart buy for any college student like myself!"
3,Good - but more of bad,Bad things:-1. All usb ports on the left side - make sure to buy a mouse with long cable2. External cable connection next to CD drive - why complicate things dear SONY3. Many keys not working - Just after two months. Am still try to figure out the SONY dealer in ISRAEL.4. There is no International free one year service like what TOSHIBA offers.
2,"very poor customer service, below average hardware","I have had the Vaio for several months, and the software installed on Vaio has finally crashed out completely. Sony now freely admits the cd recovery disk program included with the machine does not work, in fact has never worked, and they still want you to shell out 60 bucks for the cd recovery kit, which takes up to four weeks for delivery.The Keyboard on my unit arrived with the 'delete' key not working, and Sony told me that since I had purchased it mail order, I would have to send it to them for repair, and it would take three mothns MINIMUM to fix. I have instead learned to live without a delete key.Overall, a very poor experience with Sony. I will stick to Toshiba or Dell in the future, companies who were far more supportive of their products and customers."
4,Eye candy,"Hell .... a calendar is used to help you plan your month. It helps to keep you on track. Why shouldn't it also inspire you? Why shouldn't it include beautiful women in bathing suits? THANK YOU, MAXIM! That's all I gotta say. GET THIS CALENDAR if you already haven't. It's only gonna be March. So you missed a few months. There are less inspiring ways to keep track of your days, months, etc."
4,"Excellent pictures, OK battery life","We bought this camera before our vacation. It is very easy to use right out of the box. The menu has large icons with short descriptions of each function. The pictures turn out great. The video function is easy to use although the video looks shaky on playback. The battery runs down pretty quickly if you use the video function or take a lot of flash pictures. We like the convenience of using AA batteries and not being tied to a charger, but that's also its drawback. If you don't want to buy a lot of batteries, you should look at the M40. I believe it is the same as the E40 except it has a rechargeable battery pack instead."
2,BetterWorld Books,"This book was old and used, and they charged me almost $50 for it.I think they could be a little more reasonable that that. I won't order from them again."
3,A Classic Example Of 80's Horror,"While this is by no means a cult classic from the 80's horror rush it is a good entry in the Genre of Horror. It doesn't contain the mindless violence and gore of many other films of it's kind and time, but it does contain plenty of suspense, scares, and yes, some gore as well. The Story can be slow at some times, but the overall film is worth a viewing."
5,Got for son!,Son liked this old movie that was re-done for Blu-ray. He liked it and it arrived safely and promply. Thanks.
3,Not Bad,"I love horror films. I especially love 80s slasher flicks, they're my guilty pleasure. Terror Train is not an overly gory film and there is an actual story and not just needless deaths.The premise is simple. It's graduation time for many college students and to celebrate a train is rented for a long party. Without giving more away, the students find themselves aboard with a psychotic killer who starts killing people quietly, no one knows until several kids are dead.If you want a quick scare w/ some genuine scares this is for you."
3,Saw a review DVD copy-nice transfer- shame about the movie,"Jamie Lee appears in `Terror Train' returning to a genre that had shot her to stardom in 1978s `Halloween.' Directed by Roger (`Tomorrow Never Dies,' `Air America') Spottiswoode, Curtis stars alongside Ben Johnson as a college co-ed in this cult horror movie that features a knife wielding psychopath crashing a masquerade ball aboard a chartered train. Included among the cast is David Copperfield, playing a part that must have been a stretch for him - a magician. The main feature presentation is good and perhaps better than this rather lame ""horror"" movie deserves. The same cannot be said for the theatrical trailer which has numerous scratches, nicks and dirt on the badly preserved print. Top marks to Fox for the transfer of the feature presentation on this DVD - shame about the movie."
4,Who else is on the Train,"The movie starts at a New Years Eve party. One of the pledges Kenney is told that Alana, (played by Jamie Lee Curtis), wants him. The whole thing is setup by Doc, one of the pre-med students. Little does Alana know, but Doc is playing another cruel joke and Kenny winds up in bed with a corpse. He freaks out and starts screaming. The next scene is three years later with the same students are getting ready to graduate. In celebration they decide to have a party on a train. However, someone else boards the train and students start turning up dead.David Copperfield plays the magician.If you like the slasher movies of the 80's then you like Terror Train. It is suspenseful, scary at times but it also has humorous moments. I do enjoy the killer wondering around in the Groucho Marx mask."
4,All Aboard! The Terror Will Now Begin...,"One of the best horror films of the 1980s, this is yet another scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis vehicle. Unlike ""Halloween II,"" and ""Prom Night"" this is a good one. Some teens rent a train to go skiing, or something anyway and start dying one by one. Who is the killer, or killers? Great suspense, tight direction, and three dimensional characters make this train worth boarding."
4,Has more originality and realism than most horror movies,"I thought that this film was more original than most slasher flicks of the time and did a good job of creating suspense. It had a tight, claustrophobic feel to it, with all of the victims trapped on a moving train; and the idea of a costume party on the train helped make the costumed killer running around seem to blend in better and not so obvious. Good chase scenes!"
1,Bad 80's horror film that tries to be like Halloween,Jamie Lee Curtis continus her scream queen films in Terror Train a bad 80's horror film. The film tries to be like Halloween and Friday the 13th. The acting is really bad and the plot is weak. The only good thing is the killer's diffrent cosume changes. The direction is very bad. Maybe it's becouse the movie is to 80's and also 70's. I think only true horror film fans will like this film. I herd they where making a remake so maybe it might be better then the original.
2,Not very good.,"I wasn't that impressed with this movie. A couple of decent scenes but pales in comparison to some of the classics of the genre such as Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Compared to those films, Terror Train might as well be Finding Nemo."
2,Slighlty Derailed!!,A very unhappy young man who had a prank pulled on him seeks revenge in a rather gory way by jumping on a party train.This young man seems to change costumes every time he commits his homicides. Ben Johnson adds a bit of a touch of class to the proceedings. David Copperfield is on the train to amuse us all.The cinematography is rather well done and it makes the suspense a bit meatier as we travel the tracks to a slasher destiny.This film was made in Canada...its shows...CP
2,Great idea,"I loved the idea of the movie and a review sold me on the movie, so I bought it. I taped the movie while it was playing on a movie network but I never got around to watch it and taped over it. Anyways, loved the idea of the movie as I said. The original art work to the movie was better, I think they just put Jamie Lee Curtis on it so they could help sell the movie. The movie was decent but it was boring at times and the killings weren't all that great. If you love Curtis in horror films then you might check this movie out, its not the worst movie she's ever done. If your a causal horror fan then you might still want to check it out because it is better then the horror movies they put out today. I think when done right someone could remake this movie and make it a classic."
2,Pretty lame,It was a copy of Halloween and it used Jamie Lee Curtis to make some money it was confusing and was written verry messy just see this movie and you will see what I mean
5,Next Time You Might Want To Take The Bus.,"This is a classic horror movie from the 80's. The cast I wasn't that familiar with; but usually a horror movie with Jamie Lee Curtis is a winner by far. The story is a classic revenge tale, that takes place a year after college graduation. It's New Years Eve and Sorority/Frat group rents a train for their party. All is fine until someone is found dead on the train. Little do they know that their past joke on a pledge is coming back to haunt them; to get revenge for the humiliation done to him. I loved this movie and I decided to take a chance a purchase it through Amazon; eventhough I had never seen it before. I would recommend this hit to anyone thats a horror fan, believe me you won't be disappointed.THX,Kris L. CocKayne"
4,Terror Train,Product arrived very fast. This movie constantly has you guessing over who the true killer is and once you do the action is very exciting and scary at the same time.
4,Good Scary Old Movie with Jamie Lee,"I loved watching this movie, it took me way back when I saw it years ago as a teen. Jamie Lee Curtis once again does a great job."
5,TERROR TRAIN,JAMIE LEE CURTIS WHAT A WOMAN! HALLOWEEN WAS JUST THE BEGINNING FOR HER. NOW THIS WAS AWESOME! THE SCREAM QUEEN IS RUNNING AGAIN THIS TIME IN A MOVING TRAIN. NOWHERE TO RUN AND NOWHERE TO HIDE. WHAT A GREAT HORROR FILM TO HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION. EVERYTHING WAS AWESOME AND IT WAS A GREAT HORROR FILM. A MUST GET IF YOU ARE A TRUE HORROR FAN! GET THIS MOVIE!
4,Jamie Lee has no where to run!!!,"Jamie lee is on a train, and she can't escape from a killer who is after her and other college students who are all celebrating new years!!!A classic slasher! This is in my top fifteen, mainly because jamie lee curtis stars in it. A fun thrill ride!"
1,ITS OK..NOT ALL THAT,"ONLY THING GRAND IS THAT JAMIE LEE PLAYED IN IT,OUTSIDE OF THAT SOME MORON HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO BUT GO ON A TRAIN AND TRY TO KKILL FOLKS..INNOCENT FOLKS..WASNT MUCH OF A GOOD PLOT OR ANYTHING TO ME,NOT WORTH THE BUCK IF YOU ASK ME!!"
1,Skip It.....,"I fully expected to like this film. Why? Jamie Lee Curtis, who really could do no wrong in horror films around this period, is the star of the film. I LOVE Halloween I and II, Prom Night, and The Fog. That being said, 4 out of 5 ain't bad, and this is the one out of 5 you should forget about. This movie is an endless bore; nothing happens, basically a cruel prank at the beginning explaining the killers motives, then about and hour and a half of kids walking around on a train, some drinking and dancing, a few short (not scary or suspenseful) murder scenes here and there. By the time the movie is over you just won't care anymore."
1,"fun game, received in terrible condition","Great game, however, received in terrible condition. Very dirty. Listed as a ""factory-second"" type item, but item was clearly used. Previously owned by a smoker. Seller eventually handled the poor quality, but was slow to work with me. I would hesitate to use this seller again."
3,"Fun, but know you won't learn how to play guitar","My nephew was having a great time playing this and really loves it. Unfortunately it does not teach you at all anything about playing guitar, so there is no musical educational value to it. You do develop finger coordination from using the buttons which are like frets, which may be helpful to a player. So as long as you know that going in, you should have fun."
1,Stopped reading the Disk after playing it once,My kids played it once and then the disk would not work. Contacted company and received no help with soultion to problem nor would the honor a replacement only alternative is to buy another one at a department store and return the one that does not work
1,Simply Pointless,"In the time it takes to play this game, you could actually pick up a real guitar and learn to play the songs. This is game is good enough for 'posers' and people who lack the talent to improve themselves by learning to play an actual instrument."
5,What a Blast!,"So much fun ..thought it would be cheesey, but turns out when playin (with friends especially) Everyone gets into it.Plus playin on a big screen tv with surround sound its awesome!!!!!!"
5,GREATEST GAME EVER!!!,this game is sick...I love it...Play it everyday and now that you can download songs off xbox live that makes it 10 times better. SWEET
5,Great Game for the 360,I really like the Guitar Hero games and this one is as fun as the others. Although it is not as hard as GH3 it is still pretty challenging when playing on expert mode. The guitar that comes with this game will work with GH3 and Rock Band.
2,"Broken, Already.","...and we were not ""rockin' it too hard"". The controller just stopped working, total of maybe 3 hours of use. *sigh*My friend had this happen to his as well. Must have had a few bad days running at the old China assembly house. Get it from a store so you can turn the stupid thing back in without the hassle of mailing it back."
4,Not a good controller if you play Lefty Flip,"I'll pass on doing an in depth review, as many others have explained this game longer and more completely than I could. However, I do want to make a comment regarding this controller. The angular guitar does not easily lend itself to playing in the left handed mode. The PS2 version had a more symmetrical guitar that easily flips, but this is not true of the Xbox360 version. Playing while standing with the strap is ok, but if you play it sitting, it's quite awkward."
3,Guitar hero bundle,When I first got the game it worked fine but now every time I get on it kicks me off and says the disk is unreadable. This is the only game my Xbox can't read and has problems with.
4,What can I say that hasn't already been said?,"Fun game, good guitar. We definitely enjoy GH3 more, but having the backup usb-corded guitar is nice when the batteries die on the wireless."
5,Guitar Hero 2 Bundle,"This game was made for me! I had played at Wal-Mart for weeks, so my husband bought it for me for Christmas. I have not stopped playing since. The song choices are great, and it's even more fun playing multiplayer. A definate 10/10!"
3,Downloadable Content For All! But there's a catch,"Guitar Hero for Xbox 360 brings everything its PS2 counterpart had and more. There is so much content that you can rock out for hours and never get board. The game even offers downloadable content to extend your rock star experience. The only downside I see with the DLC is the price which explains the three star overall rating. Songs come in packs of three. So if there is a song you want, you have to get the other two. The price per song is what really prevents me from purchasing any downloads. At the current rate, it would take over $96 to purchase all the songs from the original game. A steep price when you can find a deal on the game its self for PS2 for under $30. Throw in a cheep guitar and you're set. If they would lower the price to a $1 a song, I wouldn't even mind the bundles. However for now, 500 MS Points is too much in my opinion and unless the price goes down, I will not be purchasing any extra songs."
3,course management????,I find it hard to belive that they could even do a course management in know for a fact that using breezy normal medium you have over 32 different wind positions and being that i have over 1000 on -line games an under par handi capp i have only had a few games that actually have matched their given shots.. In addition i find that after having developed my own distance and putting & chipping charts are much more accurate than those shown .. I would like to say on a good note they do present a good slice & hook chart for no wind conditons and basic explaination of game is good nothing outstanding as i have heard others say...just my opion..Sheldonz TPC
4,Excellent start for the beginner and tips for the experience,"When i first began playing LS98 I could not find very many ways to improve. I soon after found this book by Chris Jensen about LS98. My game improved tremendously as I read it. Alot of the information is an easy read and it offers many tips for both the beginner and even a seasoned Ls98 golfer. I still use it when I am not sure about a shot, I read the pertaining paragraph, for instance windy conditions and then develop the strategy for my shot. There are many places online to get great information, but I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for that little extra edge"
2,SOOO disappointed,"I love the features on this phone. The phone book is easy to use, the voicemail access button, the volume controls...loved it. But, I found that the phone got terribly static-y when I simply walked across my house. Which seems ridiculous for a 5.8 GHz phone. Most troubling, however was that my call waiting caller ID didn't work. It worked on other phones, just not this one.When I say I loved this phone, I meant that I loved it enough to go and buy another set, thinking that the problem was just with the first one I bought, but even on the second one cw/cid didn't work. I called Uniden's customer service who were SO rude and unhelpful, telling me that I just needed to return it to the store where I got it. I won't be purchasing another uniden product again. Ever."
5,excellent product for the price,We have had these phones for over 3 years and haven't had a single problem with them. I especially like the 2-way intercom and handset finder features.
1,Volume is poor/ineffetive.,"The volume on the handsets was unsatisfactory. We tried calling several people with both handsets and on one could hear us well. Distance from the base made no difference. Returned the set and went back to our old panasonic 900 mhz portable phone. Will try some other brand than Uniden. Lots of neat features on this phone, but the performance is poor."
4,A good read,this held my attention all the way through. I liked the characters and the pacing. There were somewhat repetitious scenes but for the most part I found it well written and enjoyable.
3,Surprisingly good!,"I had no idea what this book would be like, the cover definitely threw me and didn't make me want to open it but I was not disappointed. It took a little bit to get into it in beginning but quickly picked up. The story is about teens who have ran away from foster care and are making it on their own, when a robbery happens to change it all. From the moment a armed gunman attacks a convenience store the magic of one girl is called forth to save those who are all she has left and the one who tried to take them from her. The rest of the book is her having to deal with her magic and learning to make decisions about control and not letting others use her. If your up for magic, murder, teen runaway, love, fantasy it's here."
4,Ellen please write more,"I read Bedlam Boyz several years ago, and have been checking for more from Ellen Guon ever since. I write this mostly to encourage Ellen to please write more! I started with Mercedes Lackey but have found Ms. Lackey to be increasingly and annoyingly whiny in her books. Ellen Guon has just the right combination of attention to character and plot, a balance which Ms. Lackey has lost. Ellen -- please write more!"
4,"First experience with kindle book, very nice!","However, I think I will prefer hard copy of any academic books in future since it will be easier to have a quick browse and find specific sections."
1,...the entire book is printed upside down,"So i received my copy and it's fine, aside from the fact that the entire thing is printed upside down. Now whenever I'm reading out of it for my class people look at me like I'm an idiot :oD I do find it funny that when you open it, it proudly says ""PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"" upside down on the first page."
5,Most comprehensive echo text,"This is one of the best books I have encountered for adult echocardiography, and is the reference source in our echolab. I am eagerly awaiting its newer edition. The text is easy to read and is accompanied by thousands of excellent photographs."

4,My daughter loves it!,"We picked this up at the Crayola Store. My 3 yo daughter picked this out. She loves using colored chalk on the driveway, but doing individual scribbles by hand takes awhile for her. With this she runs all over the driveway making paths with it, or we try to make shapes. She likes to think she covered the whole area in a few minutes. I gave it 4 stars for durability but we have only used it a few times so far, and she isn't like my boys who smash and crash their toys."
4,Gave as gift,I gave this as a gift but from what I can tell the little girl likes it. It looked nice in the package.
3,Shower Sump,This product tends to be weak around the inlet areas. Caution must be taken not to overtighted the hose clamps.
4,NOT for Thicker doors,"Despite the description (up to 2' thick doors, obviously should have been inch not foot), it won't work on anything over (guessing) 1-1/4"" door. I have a 1-1/2"" 'forever door' that obviously isn't, and it won't work, had to return. Construction was good, not typical super-cheap, so had it fit, I would have used it."
4,St Ives Firming Mask,"I recommend this mask, I have been using it for years, and have always had excellent results,You can't beat it. It compares well to more expensive products.Leaves my face smooth , firmed and soft."
4,Price hasn't gone up compared to the other product I use from St. Ives. Thank you.,A product which has really helped my face. And will continue to use. And the price is excellent. I have bought this for my Grand-daughter that she will continue to use now.
4,Good Product Bad Seller,I would buy this product again and again. Works great in clearing out the plugs in my cheeks and tightens pores. Just beware of this seller. The tubes in my two pack were half empty and there was product smeared all over the cap of one of them.
5,Great stuff,"I've been using this mask for years and I love it. I've tried others but this one has the best texture - very creamy and easy to apply and rinse. It renews my skin, tightens pores and makes me look a few years younger for a couple days.The only thing I don't like about this mask is St. Ives discontinues it periodically. Buy it while you can!"
1,Dark Tower,"Whoever Financed this film should have asked for the funds back,It has been badly edited goes between Spanish heard in the background,nothing scary about it, it seems more like a bad soap opera."
4,"Pretty, but...","Its a nice charm. I bought this for my girl because we have matching tattoos of the symbol, however this charm was not meant for a Pandora bracelet, so if you are thinking of getting one for that reason, save your money. Looks good though."
2,"These cookies have a ""marshmallow"" flavor",They have a marshmallow type of after taste. The texture crumbly like keebler. I don't like these and the price is UNGODLY! I got 12 packs with 2 cookies in each pack
5,Some essential Clarence Williams classics...,"This is a great re-issue of Clarence Williams recordings between 1926-27. This Cd includes and starts off with a classic ""Jackass Blues"" and ends with a hot ""Candy Lips,"" and everything inbetween is virtually a classic, this is Williams' best period for Dixieland small group jazz. Hot, fun, and essential jazz."
4,great desk,I have had this desk for 10 years not the cherry version but a plain tan version. been a great desk for a multiple monitor setup. do not use crt monitors unless you want to break the monitor stands. lots of room to even but a stereo between the monitors. the keyboard tray slides are a little cheap and the fact you can end up kicking your pc if you put it under the desk since there is no enclosure for it. that's where 1 star gets taken away.Overall its a solid desk great for multiple monitor setups and decently compact and fits through most doorways without taking it apart.
4,Fun brain teasers.,There's something for everyone in this book. Lots of variety in the types of puzzles as well as the skill level needed to solve them.Bought this book to entertain young guests and ended up trying them myself.
3,"Content OK; video, editing poor","I found viewing this video very frustrating. Too often the groomer's arm or shoulder was in the way, or she was cutting on the side of the dog away from the camera. Other times she was doing some detail cut and the camera view appeared to be from across the room. I've viewed a lot of grooming videos on You Tube, but I wanted to see something professional. This was disappointing. There were some sections of good information, but the primary take-home message seemed to be ""practice, and if you mess it up, it'll grow back.""Ratings: Content:3-4, video/editing:2, Price I'd be willing to pay for it, if I knew what I know now:$9.95"
1,"DVD skips completely, case cracked‚Äîwhat a joke!",Got this DVD as a gift for my mother who wanted to start grooming their maltese. Am I ever glad I watched it first. Skips and can't even detect what they are saying. Case was cracked and would NEVER purchase from this seller again. Buyer beware!
1,A good video? I wouldn't know !,"I know this sounds sarcastic but I was so looking forward to receiving this DVD. The first one came and immediately it would start snd stop suddenly, skip and keep stopping. I returned it for an exchange hoping it was the DVD and a new one would work. The replacement DVD did the same thing so I had to return it. I never really got to watch the video. Not sure what the problem is. I watch DVD's all the time so I can't imagine it's my machine."
1,very unhappy,"I was really enjoying the dvd and all of a sudden, it started pausing, and stopping. I was very unhappy with the quality of the dvd. I can't send it back because it was opened. I'm hoping the company that sells it will send a new one and make it right. S. Stewart"
2,Not really for the beginner,"This tape really doesn't show you how to do all of the cuts listed. In fact, you don't ever see a complete groom from start to finish and all of the dogs are show dogs who stand perfectly still without the use of a grooming tether. The tape also assumes a certain amount of knowledge about grooming and grooming tools; she tells you the name of the tools but not why she choose them or which breeds to use them on. I was expecting a step by step video including expert tips on grooming but it was more a ""show"" with occasional comments tossed out. The groomer almost seemed bored with her job! I purchased it so that our novice volunteers could learn about grooming but I don't see how it will help educate them. We'll probably never use it."
4,Save money by grooming your dog!,"This video shows you how to wash your dog, use electric clippers,use scissors, and clip nails. It shows all types of haircuts and is easy to follow."
1,Not the same!,These just didn't taste right. They were missing the chalky taste that i remember. I'm not sure if the recipe was changed but I can't even eat these. What a waste :(
4,candy,The candy hit the right note for my Granddaughter's birthday party. The kids loved it and was asking for more when it was all gone.
1,READ before you buy! Hard as a rock...,"OUTSOURCING GONE VERY, VERY WRONG!Another reviewer noticed these are now made in Colombia, and sure enough, they are.These are very, very hard and definitely don't have the same taste as the original candy. They are also aesthetically inferior to the original product - many pieces are misshapen.Unfortunately, the wonderful candy these used to be are long gone. I will never buy these again."
5,Just like being a kid again,"I LOVE THESE! They are the exact same since I was kid. All 24 boxes came in tact. Not too many in each box but if you remember they were always like that. Love them, cant go wrong :)"
5,"Good , Great gift and good taste","You only get the kings. round up, victory and stallion names not the otherGreat productGot here in 4 or 5 days less than what estimation wasVery happy with the candyNot a lot of the sticks were broken about 1 or 2 per packalso the pricing was hella amazing"
1,Terrible disappointment.,Don't buy it. I threw it in the garbage after trying a few of those.Don't know what else to say -- I was terribly disappointed.
5,CANDY!,My kids love these candies. I put them aside to surprise them once in a while. My daughter wanted to take the whole box in her room and hide it! :)
5,Delicious,"I have loved these things since I was a kid, but it's unbelievably hard to find them in person. When I saw them selling in packs of 24 here, I wasted no time in ordering 2. They arrived very quickly, and after some distribution among friends, they were all gone in a matter of 3 days. The only buyer's remorse here is that I didn't buy more."
1,Horrible,"I was expecting these to be gum, my mistake. But I still like candy. I tried one, and they tasted horrible!"
2,Not what I expected,"Not what I expected. First of all, high shipping cost, about 5.45$ for shipping and handling. THESE ARE NOT BUBBLE GUM CIGARRETTES!!!! These are little sticks of sugar!!! Do not be decieved. You cannot blow sugar out of the end like the bubble gum ones."
1,Candy Cigarettes not like they were...,"I recently ordered another box of these candy cigarettes. I like to keep them in stock for my grandchildren. This time they were not the same... The last box listed, 'gelatin', in the ingredients and this new box lists, 'beef gelatin'. They are not as good as the previous boxes and the grandchildren haven't even asked for them again since they tried a box of the new ones. The ingredients have also been listed in a different order compared to the previous box. Not sure I will ever order them again! Unless of course, they go back to the other recipe and then I know I will order them again. I have been eating these ever since I was a child... It will be a shame if they don't go back to the old recipe..."
1,just AWFUL!,worst candy cigs i have ever had. I don't even know where they got these. Hard as rock and horrid taste.Sooo disappointing. got them for my mom as a surprise and they will just be heading o the trash instead. should demand our money back.
1,I bought garbage.,"I contacted the seller after the item's metal parts(brittle wire) broke when I first took it out of the box and tried to adjust the folded up strap. They never responded. This deserves the lowest of low ratings. It's leather looked OK, but the parts that make it work were, as I said brittle wire."
3,carryall shoulder bag,"I have been looking for a small crossover bag with multiple compartments. I hate a large purse which is all you can seem to find for women. I found this under ""man bags"" and for the most part it suffices. The lining is very cheap which I would not have expected for a leather bag. It also does not have a convenient zipper compartment large enough for cash unless the cash is folded which I do not like. I will use this for awhile but am having an old purse I purchased over 25 years ago refurbished. I will keep this in reserve in case of ""broken strap"" emergencies (which is all that went wrong with my old bag)."
5,An Excellent Gift for Any Formula One Fan,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this golden age of Formula One racing. It would also make an excellent gift for the F1 enthusiast. The photos are spectacular and Daley's writing is evocative; reading the book really brings you back to the late-50s/early-60s of Formula One. I wasn't even alive at the time, yet reading the book made me feel as if I was reliving these years."
1,Rolfing DVD,"By the name, you would think you are getting information that can be applied. Instead it was a slow moving explanation of Rolfing. The slow deep draw voice of the Englishman nearly put me to sleep."
4,"Different, but poignant and spiritual","Hootie broke away from the poppy, guitar-rock, flavor of Cracked Rear View, to make Fairweather Johnson, appropiately named for the bandwagon Hootie fans who dissapear when radio stops playing their tunes. As if they knew what was coming the band sophomore effort didnt raise much attention and after Old Man & Me and Tucker's Town, the album stopped getting airplay. Style-wise, the album is different than CRV. With more of a folk charge, deeper lyrics, and slower rythyms, the band falls away a tad from the upbeat spirit it instilled on CRV, even on CRV's slower tracks. The band does hit the mark with the syrup-sweetened Sad Caper and She Crawls Away, and the melodic ballad Tootie is the highlight of the CD. The CD could have used a little more pep, and I feel it failed to really encompass the band's true talents and emotional charge, especially during it's live shows."
3,"A solid album, sluggish vocals & music","Hootie's follow up to Cracked Rear View leaves the band sounding tired, and bored. Don't get me wrong, there's great songs, ""Let it breathe"", ""Tucker's Town"", ""Earth Stopped Cold at dawn"", but it's not the best the band could have done."
1,I did not like this CD,"I didn't like this CD because the choice of music was extremley poor.I mean, I didn't even recognize 90% of the songs. This is probably Hootie and the Blowfish's worst album."
4,"I just love Hootie, their pain, their love...","I bought this CD the day it came out and i have to say it was one of those CD's i played once, and put it away. I said this sucks. But you know what, being the loyal fan that i am, i brought it out weeks later and listened to it, really listened to it, and i fell in love with Hootie and the Blowfish all over again. This album is not as poppy as their first, but that is because they grew as a band and as individuals, and that shows in this album. Just listen to the words, you will love it, then you should buy their third album, which by far is their best."
4,Good Album but Just Not As Good As Original,"I bought ""Cracked Rear View"" in '94 and couldn't wait for the next record to come out and in '96 I got my wish. This record is great, but it just didn't have all of what the first record had. I still really do like this record though. My favorite tracks on here are ""Sad Caper"" and ""Old Man and Me"". If you like Hootie then you should like this album."
3,Arrived in good time,Arrived quickly and packaged well. The vinyl however is extremely flimsy. The sound is good and the songs are great.
4,Challenging game for elementary students,"My students like this game. Would have given it five stars, but it needs more ""noodles"".. I had to supplement with straws."
1,Power Rangers Time Force,"I have just 1 word for this game... BORING! I am so disappointed with Sony! We have Power Rangers Light Speed which is so awesome and much better and action packed than this boring time force game. Wake up sony! We want a better power rangers game next time and we miss light speed. BRING BACK THE LIGHT SPEED GANG. Send the time force gang back in time! Almost forgot to add, you can't play 2 players with this boring game, you can only play 2 megazords fighting each other and not the bad guys, totally stupid!"
4,Excellent Saga,"The Tomoe Gozen saga, consisting of ""Tomoe Gozen"", ""The Golden Naginata"" and ""Thousand Shrine Warrior"" is an excellent piece of fiction set in an alternate universe - one where magic exists and works, where monsters, devils, spirits and gods exist and intercede in human affairs.In Naipon, that universe's version of Japan, Tomoe Gozen, a female samurai, battles to retain her sense of honor and self.Salmonson writes vivid character descriptions, but the style is at times a bit flat. Mostly, this seems due to the tale occurring from the point of Tomoe, who puts her bushido before her own wants and needs. Very rarely, that flatness interferes (I think) with the storytelling. Still, this is a tremendously underrated work and I always love recommending it to people who are at all interested in epic fantasy."
3,"A fascinating, if confusing story","Tomoe Gozen travels through fictional Naipon with all the inevitability of Conan in a really bad mood. Swinging two samurai swords, there is no opponent she can't out-fight, even to the point of conquering a whole army single-handed! The story is often confusing, with scenes taking on the feel of a dreamscape.That said, the story has a charm that kept drawing me back to it. The author transports the reader to her world, immersing them in its rich distinctiveness. If you are interested in a high-fantasy story, set in an Oriental setting, then I would recommend this book to you. (I just wouldn't be able to give you a summary of the storyline.)"
3,need help,Iam also stuck in level 4 and haven't been able to find my way out so my game is sitting in the case also.would like to see a stradegy guide with a few hints in it
2,Where's the magic?,"I just bought this game new for about $30 because I love the movie. The mazes in the first few levels are very frustrating and the later levels are even worse. It doesn't even have the ET theme song. Games are supposed to be fun, which this one is not."
4,A not well known record of Deodato,"Track 4 seems to be the best. In this record, Deodato plays between the sound of ""Prelude"" and the sound of ""Very together."" The result is ambiguous."
2,So Boring I Could Have Cried,"I really wanted to enjoy this book, but sadly, I did not. Freeman's writing was extremely dry. She turned what was a series of exciting experiences into drudgery. Freeman got really bogged down in the endless detailing of school policies that added nothing to the overall story being told. For someone who was so pivotal in the Free Speech Movement, I expected a more impassioned account. This was like reading my tax return."
5,"their major label debut in 1996, So ahead of time, unfortunately overlooked on national scene","These guys are local favorites The Wisconsin and Chicago area. I say these guys first at the release of the 4th independent album Collide, and a second time 7 months later when Atlantic signed them and released this album, which is mostly songs from collide with some substitutions. This album polished the sound a bit more, and is just easy to listen to. Atlantic signed them seeing the promise of this unique sound, but unfortunately nationally they never gained a huge gathering, likely the inept promotion by record company executives. The sound could have easily been national. Check this album out. I just got their newest album ""a different Sea"" release a couple of weeks ago, still going stong."
5,Wonderful product,"If your on any kind of budget and start choking when you see $500 or $1,000 for 3D software this is an excellent product. Bryce 5 has an easy to learn interface that allows you to move and alter objects, change atmosphere, and change camera views without having to beat it with a stick. The program lets you save objects, textures, and atmospheres you've created into the program so that they're always there when you come back. It also comes with alot of preset object and textures you can use, so you can create an image the first time you open the program. This isn't the program you want if your trying to do complex character animation, but it's really good for landscapes, architecture, and background. If your not sure this product is for you go to a few 3D sites and look at images people have made with Bryce 5. I've been using it for a year and I'm really happy with it."
2,Save Yourself the Upgrade,"As a long time user of Bryce 2, 3 and 4, I was sorely disappointed with v. 5. The rendering machine is extremely slow, and did not produce higher quality results than older versions. The addition of the tree lab is nice, but that's the only feature that is added. Any other ""improvements"" are not obvious or counter-productive."
1,"Hardly ""Conversin""","Let me be as brutally honest as I can: this recording did nothing for me, because the musicianship is subpar and the leadership is just terrible. Why do record companies continue to promote such pointless drivel as this recording? There's no lyrical beauty, melodic invention, or any kind of deep feeling. I'm sorry, but this isn't jazz and it never will be. After hearing recordings such as ""Conversin' with the Elders,"" I'm only reminded of the fact that I'm happy for the bebop movement of the late '40s through mid '60s. Carter is a sorry excuse for a saxophonist. Give me Hawkins, Johnny Griffin, Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis, Desmond, Webster, Getz, Zoot, Al Cohn, Art Pepper, Benny Golson, Gigi Gryce, Stanley Turrentine, Ike Quebec, etc. any day of the week.Let me also say that anytime you call an album ""Conversin' With The Elders"" you show just how little class you have. It's a stupid name for stupid album."
5,4 port Cybex KVM Switch,"I have not hooked this up yet, I totally should to make sure it works actually... I know the product as we use it at work all the time. It is a GREAT KVM switch. Very basic and does the job well. Just like any other electronic, you treat it right and 9 times out of 10 it will treat you right."
1,Embarassing,"An obvious attempt at cashing in on the name of a once proud, creative ,interesting classic American psych band. Doug Ingle,always the lead singer/principal songwriter is absent entirely leaving those duties in the incapable hands (mostly) of guitarist Erik Braun. What do we get, horrible vocals, occassinal out of tune guitar and the most laughably bad songs ever written (Check out ""Searchin'Circles""). Sounds nothing like Iron Butterfly; more like a talentless hippie kid Deadhead wannabee concoction.Possibly one of the worst records ever made."
2,Understood Critical Reviews,"I can fully understand the bad reviews given about S. Beauty. (not as bad a 1 or 0 stars) Eric Bruann's songs here may not be the best, but his voice & guitarmanship is worthy of hearing. The cd to buy from this area of IB (74-75) is clearly Sun & Steel, a very good cd that contains 2 of the best IB songs I ever heard: ""Beyond The Milky Way"" & ""Watch The World Goin' By""."
4,MISSING DOUG INGLE,Doug Ingle was the lead singer of the true Iron Butterfly and Erik Braun was the guitarist.
5,Early years.,"Great opportunity to hear the voice of young Luis Miguel. He started his brilliant career at the age of 12. This album contains the songs from his early albums that are not available anymore: ""1+1=2 Enamorados"", ""Decidete"", ""Directo al Corazon"", and ""Palabra de Honor""."
2,Totally disappointing.,"Where's Luis? It looks like it will be him, but it's not. These are just his songs sung by other people. If you're a fan of his, stick with cds where his picture is on the cover. That way you'll know you're really getting Luis and not a bunch of different people trying to sing his songs."
2,Trying to reach a deadline much?,I'm usually a huge fan of Bobbi Smith and this book started out really really good. The last few chapters were a bit rushed and less detailed than her usual bestsellers. It was an easy ending. It seemed like she was rushing to make a deadline.
4,"A good, standard aromatherapy book","If you're just getting interested in aromatherapy, this book is a good one to start with. I started with other books on the subject, but am glad I have this in my library. If you already know a fair bit about aromatherapy, you probably already know most of what's in this book. Even though this book was published originally in 1988, it is still full of valid facts and observations. Nothing about what has been written has changed.In the book Tisserand has listed case histories where use of essential oils has helped a variety of problems, both physical and mental. He gives good background of aromatherapy's historical origins, and makes us aware of the different types of aromatherapy--holistic, medical/clinical and aesthetic. There is a chapter on essential oils, which includes distilling information and traditional maladies certain oils are used for. My favorite is the chapter on home remedies. I'm a home remedy freak--can't have too many of those."
5,A Florence museum guide rounds out this unforgettable voyage,"Part of the Museum City Series, Florence: Cradle of the Renaissance is an amazing DVD tour of Italy's cultural center, known for being the epicenter of a cultural rebirth in art, architecture, and philosophy during the 15th century. Taking the viewer on a tour of Florence's most well-known masterpieces, including Michelangelo's David, The Bapistry Doors, Giotto's Bell Tower, the Pazzi Chapel, the Medici and Uffizi palaces, and the Birth of Venus, Florence: Cradle of the Renaissance celebrates both great art and landmark history. A Florence museum guide rounds out this unforgettable voyage, especially recommended for armchair travelers, and surely the next best thing to flying to Florence to see its great treasures in person. 33 minutes, digitally mastered audio & video."
4,"""Where has he been ?",Was not able to hear his new music but i am a fan of Jon B's and I am glad to see he is back in the game. His voice is the bomb!
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I wish that the amazon rating system would let you rate negative stars... That is what this CD deserves. The music sounds like a cassette tape that has been through the ringer. The backgrounds sound like a third grade band put the CD together.. poorly. This is the worst album i have ever, ever heard. It would be better to take your money and wipe your rear with it.. At least that would be more satisfying."
2,You raise me up,The accompaning music without the added voices is too difficult to use as a separate singing without the use of karaoke style screen to follow.
1,karaoke josh groban,"I purchased this CD in good faith and after listening to it I feel betrayed. Josh Groban does not sing on this CD. After looking on your computer web page, it is listed as Josh Groban. I would like to return this awful CD. I thought that anything from Amazon would be right. Boy, was I wrong. My rating is below 1, perhaps sub zero."
1,two defective lights in a row,"I have now placed two consecutive orders for this light, and both arrived in defective condition and had to be returned. I already own three of them, and so I know how they work and how they are assembled, but something has gone wrong with this supplier.The first light was missing the plastic knob that is used to turn the light on and off.The second order had the plastic knob, but now was missing the two indentations on the light assembly that are necessary to attach the hood to the assembly."
1,Do not buy this book,"This book is a waste of money. It does not deliver any info to those looking for information on past dealings of Freemasonry thru the journal of Ben Franklin. There are only about 20 pgs of text and the rest contains mystical pictures -and I quote from book"" ...are not related to this book..."" and ""have been included for your enjoyment."" Blah.. save your money this is not the book you want."
1,An honest appraisal.,"Although I'm a lover of books, always have been, I've never written a review before, mostly b/c nothing I've read has really moved me to do so. . . until now. I have to say, I've patiently worked through this book for several months now and have trudged through a good portion of it. Folks, this is bad. I mean, REALLY bad!!The entire book is nothing more than Ms. Vendler pontificating just to hear herself pontificate. She slings personal opinion around like candy. The entire read is exceedingly boring, poorly argued, stuffy, and taught me absolutely nothing about poetry.Steer clear is my advice."
3,They are what they are,These convinced me that sardines packed in water are just not as good as those in Olive oil. So I guess these are ok compared with other low sodium packed in water but if you want them to actually taste good go with packed in olive oil.
4,Price Increases Come Fast and Furious,"These are very good sardines and I have been getting them regularly through Amazon's Subscribe and Save for several years now. In a recent but quick series of price increases, the Reese S&B; sardines have gone up a full ten bucks per package, from $13 to $23 for the ten can (tin can--haha) item.Perhaps they were a little underpriced early on, but I can't take many more of these substantial increases. The problem is that there is really nowhere else to go if you like the no muss, no fuss utility that these Reese S&B;'s bring to the table. If I just ate a can a week or so, I wouldn't really feel the price increase. Sadly, that's not the case. I go through them pretty quick. Be forewarned. They're good. They're also good and spendy."
3,"good, but too pricey. Also, I like the bones","I ordered a package, and have used up all 10 cans. I am ready to order another package. But the price tag shocked me. $25 for 10? Give me a break. I forgot what I paid last time. If I indeed paid $25, I might be out of my mind that day.Yes. The product tastes good, and the can is very easy to open. I can get a lot of protein and omega-3 without a lot of sodium and calories. But a regular can of sardine is only 50 cents or even 33 cents in the grocery store. Why do I want to pay so many times more? I didn't get a raise. I need to save my $ to pay my gas bill.I decided to go for local brand. If I take in a bit more calorie or sodium, I'm try to eat less of other stuff. Higher fat may not be bad, because it may mean higher omega-3. And I love the bones, because they contain calcium. I do not need boneless sardine."
1,never buy this product,I had absolutely no idea that these sardines were salt free. They had absolutely NO taste. Here I am stuck with 19 cans of same. Had to throw out the one I opened.
5,"Advantages: No salt, no scales, lower in calories, and no frightening arteries clinging to the bones","Disadvantages: Less long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), less calcium, less delicious than sardines in olive oil with salt, and higher-priced compared to sardines with skin and bones in tomato sauce such as Crown Prince Sardines in Tomato Sauce, 15-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12), which is priced at $19.69 or Crown Prince Sardines in Tomato Sauce, 7.5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12), which is priced at $13.72."
5,The Three Pigs,Gave this book as a gift to my daughter who used it in her class as a teaching aide. Her class loved it
2,The Three Pigs,I felt this story was a bit confusing and hard to follow. We were expecting the traditional tale of the Three Little Pigs. I didn't feel the story flowed enough to keep your interest. We will stick to the original story.
2,strange reading,The Three Pigs is one of my son's favorite bedtime stories and we have several different versions. This one is not my favorite. Seeing the Caldecott Award suggested it would be well done. I found it strange and somewhat difficult for my 5 year old son to understand.
5,The three pigs,This book was highly creative. It started the wheels going in all of the therapists in the school. How can we represent this story to our therapy kids.....hmmmmm.
2,too confusing`,"My daughter LOVES the three little pigs story and anything to do with the big bad wolf. Since she's only three, she did NOT get this story at all when the pigs started jumping 'out' of the storyline. It was a waste of time for a small child and I don't think it is interesting enough for an older one. The pictures are good and my daughter was excited to see the dragon."
1,Not a book to read to kids,"We retuned this book for a refund. I think it is important for people to know that this is not the normal type of book you can read to your kids. For example, some pages are practically blank. The book also has drastic shifts in illustration styles and story lines. The best I can say is that it is like a bizarre dream. I can see where some may like it, but everyone we showed it to just had an odd look and said ""OK....that's strange."" How it won an award, I'll never know."
1,satire not suitable for children,"As a parent with three young children who love to listen to stories, I was very dissapointed with this book. The illustrations were wonderful, but the storyline was cleary satire at a level small children would never understand. It makes me wonder if all the other glowing remarks from the other reviewers ever really read to children. This is strictly a coffee table book for adults!"
1,Not for kids,This book is definitely not for young kids. I love reading to my 3 year old and he loves to listen to stories. The first few pages were like the traditional 3 pigs story and then it got wierd. It's not a story. The illustrations were great but it's more for adults than children. I was dissapointed after reading the other rave reviews.
4,Irresistible kid's Pick,"I find 'The Three Pigs' - an Irresistible kids Stuff apart from the many stories like Hansel & Gretel, Snow White, Cinderella, etc. The kids love to read the tale 'The wolf huffed & puffed' and blew the house is just a repeat that the kids love to say and find out how the pigs escaped and finally, as a great picture read, the book is a imaginery fantasy. Like many other books of this tale, David Wiesner's book is a grab as it has good illustrations, dialogue balloons and style that draw attention, is a great adventure into fantasy world. A good story that kids love and a good Pick 'The Three Pigs by David Wiesner'"
4,The Three Pigs,"I am a student at West Virginia State College University. I am currently enrolled in a Children's Literature class. My professor, Mr. Samples had us to choose a Caldecott Award winning book. I chose this book because I have been a huge ""three little pigs fan"" since I was little. I think it has fabulous pictures. I think the book is unique because the author has changed the plot a little, as opposed to the older version."
1,Weird,"This is the strangest story!! Maybe I did not read the description close enough, but I had no idea that the author altered the original story so much. The pigs come off the pages of the story and into other storybooks/nursery rhymes. It is very difficult for an adult to read and follow, not to mention a child. I was very disappointed in this book. There's a good chance this will be a dust collector over the years. Don't waste your money, buy the original."
5,Good for little kids,Its a fun game but its too easy. I beat the game in 2 days. I recommend this game for young rugrats fans.
4,Yugoslav Logic - An Oxymoron?,"Robert Hayden is uniquely qualified to examine the Yugoslav mess - as a legal scholar who is deeply familiar with the families, clans, tribes and nations who made up the first and second Yugoslavias and as an anthropologist who can find his way through the constitutional jungles those peoples created. This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how the Bosnian civil war developed out of competing competing constitutional interpretations."
3,Finally - Grovyle!,"My son has been wanting a Grovyle figure forever. We've searched Targets, WalMarts and KMarts endlessly. You should have seen the look on his face when Santa brought him his Grovyle action figure. He almost fainted! This little plastic figure has made him so happy. It's not the cost, nor the size that matters! This accuratly detailed action figure really made his Christmas. Thank you!"
4,Works nicely.,"Works very well with my Mac after the apple keyboard failed after 4 years of heavy use, I can't complain."
4,Replacement Mac Keyboard,"Macally IKEY5 USB Slim KeyboardInexpensive, yet decent, Mac keyboard replacement. Does what its supposed to do. Not as smooth and quiet as some, but a lot less money, and fully functional."
1,Not USB 2.0,"I bought this because of the 2 USB ports in the top and it turns out they're not USB 2.0. Transfer rate is SLOW!! Also, I keep hitting the CAPS lock because it is so close to the SHFIT key. Returning it after giving it a week."
1,Terrible Keyboard alternative to Apple Keyboard,"If you buy based just on price then this is the keyboard for you. If you want a keyboard with keys that stick, has a cheap feel and looks lousy then this is also the keyboard for you. However if you want a solid, reliable keyboard, spend some more money and get the Apple keyboard."
2,Not lasting,"I bought three of this keyboards. I like the finger feeling, quiet and soft.The biggest problem: it does not last long. After a few months of usage, for example, the cmd+copy starts to work badly.If you want to have a keyboard for a short period of time, this one will serve you well.I myself am looking for a better solution. I may try the latest apple one, and see how it performs."
2,"To Clicky and noisy, not like a Mac keyboard","Ordered this keyboard for my Mac Book Pro so that I could lift the screen to be eye level for working all day. I thought that this would be like and sound like my regular keyboard on my Mac but it's to clicky and noisy and since i type all day, it would drive me and everyone in the office crazy. I am returning it and will have to do this in person, not online to get the one I want. I like the quiet of the Mac keyboards and I am bummed, it seemed like a great keyboard."
5,Nice to have...,I pretty much use Bluetooth keyboards wherever possible (which this is NOT). But I need a wired keyboard a lot of times when Mac systems arrive with Bluetooth turned off by default (i.e. Mac Mini Server). This works just fine.
4,"great ""bang-for-the-buck""","Chose this bargain keyboard to replace the long worn-out OEM Apple keyboard for my iMac G4. This keyboard looks great, but the keys are on the noisy side for me. Not a huge sticking point for me, but picky people may find it to be excessive. Also has the USB hub built-in, much like on the OEM keyboard. Nice keyboard for the money!"
3,"An OK Keyboard, but it's DIRT CHEAP","I needed to replace my broken Apple aluminum full sized wired keyboard with something ... shall we say less expensive.Enter the MacAlly full-sized keyboard for mac.It's a WHOPPER this thing. Certainly not for small hands like mine, but it works.I wish the Command and Control keys were a little larger, as these are common hotkeys for Photoshop, etc.It's not exactly ""Apple"" in aesthetic, and the keys go ""clickety-clack"" if you like that sort of thing.I do like the position of the two USB ports in the back - very handy for keeping a USB mouse at the right distance.It's also good that it has volume controls and an on/off/sleep switch, too.I wish it were a little compact, but what the heck, I bought if for $15 buckaroos."
4,Good but Loud,"Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. It is, however, pretty loud, and because it's full-sized, it's bigger than I needed. It's easy to use, with an easy set-up, and does the job. It works with Macs, so that's what I needed!"
2,Decent but not even close to the iceKey,"When my iceKey (another, better, keyboard by MacAlly) started to fail (4yrs old), I looked around for a suitable replacement. I noticed that MacAlly came out with another slim, low profile keyboard and thought I'd give it a try. It also didn't hurt that the iKeySlim was half the price of the iceKey.Overall, the iKeySlim is a decent keyboard but it doesn't compare to the iceKey. The keys feel cheap (actually, the entire keyboard felt cheap and light) and you have to press pretty darn hard to type anything. It's also a little bit larger than the iceKey.I'd recommed buying the iceKey over the iKeySlim if you're looking for a low profile keyboard. It may cost more but it's hands down, the better keyboard."
1,Non-Standard Key Layout.,"First, the keypad is a non-standard layout. Since you are buying this with the keypad, it makes a difference, so be warned the + sign is now a small key and the other operators were moved. (To no operator's advantage.)Second, the keys on my board are now sticking and failing and I need to replace my keyboard after only six months. I expected it to last longer. I cannot recommend this keyboard."
3,Cute ship but not a winner in this house,"My daughter who is now 6 received this cruise ship as a Christmas present when she was 5. She was so excited for it because she is a BIG Polly Pocket fan. She has so many Polly Pocket dolls, clothes and accessories and can play with them endlessly creating all sorts of storylines and such for them. She is very creative. However this toy just didn't keep her attention. It sits out for her but she would rather the dolls play with other things like some of the other Polly Pocket playsets. It's disappointing because this was a pricey gift compared to the other playsets. It might be that it's just too much work to set it up and piece it together with all of the extras...I'm not sure. It's certainly one that we don't like to close up and put everything away only to have to get it back out again (too much of a pain) so it just sits out on one of her activity tables and she sometimes plays with it. I'm about ready to give it away even though it's awfully cute."
3,X-Men bruised but not beaten,"ok, so it's not the greatest game. It is short, and if you pump all your xp points into strength the game isnt much of a challenge (an hour at the least, hour and a half at the most). The sound is awesome though, and so are the backgrounds. The graphics, while anime-ish for rogue, are really good and entertaining. The side scrolling story is somewhat lacking, but the multiplayer is the real meat of the game. Fighting with all the different characters is great, and co-op can be really fun (and since its short you can try varying stratigies with xp points). Theres a lot of work that needs to be done for the next x-men GBA game, but i'd still recomend this game to any one who enjoys x-men remotely, just cause the multiplayer is that fun."
1,How Can u mess up X-Men??,"Xmen: Reign of Apocalypse was a big disappointment to me. The graphics were average, the gameplay lacked depth, and the side-scolling was boring and repetitive, at best. If u are a die-hard X-Men fan, and I know I am, you will be greatly disappointed, as I was. Even if you are not a die-hard fan, you will be disappointed, I strongly recommend not getting this game."
2,Dissapointing,"Well, my friend owns a copy of this game. I woke up this morning and started playing it. Within 45 minutes I had the game beaten without having to continue or anything like that. It's very repetitive with a small selection of different enemies. All you have to do to beat the bosses is just stand there and punch as fast as you can, they are not hard at all. The graphics aren't the best, but they aren't lacking; they are just average. If you were into the old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's side scrolling games, you will probably think of this game on a low level because of it's quality. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle games are extremely better than this. I'd only recommend it if you are a die-hard X-men fan, or if you enjoy playing the same game over and over. I discourage older gamers from buying it just for the basic reason that it has no challenge to it at all; it is simply too easy."
1,A Feeble And Careless Attept,"I got this game today and I was pumped. However, that enthusiasm died. The graphics are o.k., the play is repeatitive and the moves are simple. So, to put it bluntly, IT SUCKED!!!"
1,This Game is not as fantasic as it looks,"I bought this game a few days before, and it really is not that good.I agree with some of the reviwers on the sound, it is really owful. I completed the game 4 times within one day using hte 4 characters. I got it refunded the next day. The plot (is aweful) and the mutant power each of the character has does not help very much. Wolferine is the easiest to use, and rouge is the most difficult character. Personally I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, save up your cash to buy some other games. Frankly, it isnot even worth one star."
3,Lou and Liz -- Face her Past,"THE BODY OF DAVID HAYES by Ridley Pearson has it's moments, but some of the moments confuse the reader and kill the suspense. Liz had an affair with a computer wizard who bilked her bank for millions when she returned to Lou Bolt and their marriage.David Hayes is released from prison to fall into the hands of those who will do anything to claim the missing money. Liz must decide to protect her marriage, her husband and the bank by playing a game close to the edge.This is a read that bounces from fun to flat to fun again.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
3,a good read,"This was a good read and typical of Pearson and Lou Bolt. It was well worth reading and it was enjoyable.The mystery reader will enjoy it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,disappointing and predictable,This a disappointing effort by Pearson. It is hard to care for his characters and after a while the whining self-absorbed narrative wears thin.It seems that Boldt and Pearson have grown tired.
2,Contrivance,"Pearson likes to take technology or science and fashion a plot around cutting edge discoveries. This time the science is old,and the ultimate solution is unexplained and leaves the reader unsatisfied. The relationship between Boldt and his wife, with all they have been through, just doesn't feel right in this one. He's done better."
2,This is Ridley Pearson?,"Having read all of Ridley Pearson's books and thoroughly enjoyed every one, I'm wondering if he really wrote The Body of David Hayes. It just does not measure up to his previous novels. Other reviewers have pointed out the timeline discrepancy, and I could not get ""connected"" with the characters as I have in the past. And to think, this is the first Pearson novel I've purchased in hardback!"
2,This book has an almost unintelligible plot,"Ridley Pearson shoots for the moon here. He tries for a nice literary prose style, a plot that unfolds like a map of Manhattan, and character studies worthy of the greatest actors.However... for the scope of this novel, the huge story it tries to tell, it is in the end a couple hundred pages too short. By this I mean Pearson is too stacato and hurried. Components of the story rush by in a blur and after one development piles ontop of another you will find yourself wondering what the hell just happened. This isn't a state you will find yourself in at the end of the book, you will find yourself here several times. The story jumps around from one line of thought to another and in the end you will feel like your mind has been in a high speed bumper car chase.Not the best Pearson book you will come across."
4,excellent fast read,"Another excellent read from Pearson. The bookmoves FAST.Some parts of the ending seem far fetched, but oh wellit was a fun ride."
2,CAN'T BE A LEGIT PART OF THE BOLDT/LAMOIA /MATTHEWS SERIES,"This book came from an alternate universe, where an alternate Ridley wrote an alternate Boldt/LaMOia/Matthews series--this book being the ninth book. This doesn't conform to the rest of the series at all. In this book, Liz is younger than she is in Art of Deception, and so are the Boldt children (based on the information that John and Daphne have worked together 9 years in Art of Deception according to John in ch 29 of Art of Deception) And Undercurrents is the first Boldt?LaMoia/Matthews series."
1,NOT WORTH THE EXCRUCIATING WAIT!!!!!!!,"I should have expected nothing after the First Victim but Middle of Nowhere and Art of Deception set me up to hopefully learn more about John and Daphne and their budding relationship and more about Liz. But then Ridley made it seem like those two books didn't even exist with this whiney diatribe about how horrible Lou's life is with a ""cheating"" wife and how he doesn't understand how his lover Daphne could go off with someone such as John LaMoia. Puhleeeeeeeeeeeeeze!!!!!And Has Ridley spent anytime in the Seattle area recently--I don't think so!!!!!"
1,This book sucked big time,"After reading a couple of Pearson's books, I was looking forward to this one that was received as a gift. Oh, what a disappointment. If I wanted to read some chick lit, I'd have grabbed one of the Whatshername Plum books. I lost count of 'feelings' conversations in BoDH. Gag me, already. The book was padded as hell with overly long, boring dialog. Like many of today's authors of action/thriller/mystery, this is another example of throwing in girl junk into a novel in an attempt to sell books to that demographic."
4,The Body of David Hayes,"This was an excellent book! The story was fast paced and realistic. The officer was in a virtually no win situation and managed to pull out a believable and gripping ending. This was the first book I have read by this author, but it definitely won't be the last. Although this is not the first in this story line, it can be read as a stand alone. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Cheap Tricks,"In one sense, this book is an easy read. In another, it doesn't make much sense. I kept looking back to see if I missed something on the previous page(s). When an author withholds information that would allow the reader to understand what's going on, and never explains suppositions that guide central characters' judgments and actions relative to each other, the reader is faced with wading through writing tricks masquerading as suspense and character development. That's what we have here. Pretty thin stuff. In the end, the main character Lou Boldt is described as lieing in the post incident police investigation. The author doesn't even offer us that writer's gimmick to tie together the story (as well as exposing true police procedure).The consensus of reviewers is that other Pearson novels in this series are better. I'll have to check one more."
2,Not one of his best by a long shot,"Ridley Pearson is a real hit or miss author and this one is a miss. This resembles a plot for a soap opera and not a thriller.The only thrill is when it finally ends and I confess I skimmedthe last 20 or so pages because I just didn't care how Liz gotout of her jam. Boldt is supposed to be madly scrambling to savehis marriage, but he still finds time to be irritated thatDaphne has moved on with his friend, LaMoia. The whole Lou/Lizbit has run its course, and LaMoia was infinitely more interesting before finding domestic bliss. We need a little action in the next book, Ridley!"
2,"MAKE A DECISION, RIDLEY!!!!!","Either write romantic suspense where all the stories have happy endings and the couples get together and stay together or right a gritty police procedural with real human emotions. don't try to combine the two--this effort was a mediocre one at best. The Art of Deception was much better.And did you review any of your previous works in the series, before writing this--because it doesn't fit the timeline that the other books set out. Liz's affair with David Hayes couldn't have happened six years ago--by my alculations, that would have made it in the middle of No Witnesses--a good example of your writing. And you established in that book, and in Art of Deception that LIz knew about Daphne.Finally, Lou whines too much and lies too much to himself about his feelings. Either get rid of him, or demote him to minor character status and bring on John and Daphne. I wish I got a copy of the connecting chapter; maybe that would explain a few things."

1,Terrible...,"The instructions were completely wrong. If you actually follow the instructions, you'll be left with gruel to eat. If you like gruel, this probably won't be a problem."
1,Avoid at all costs!,"I bought this straightener to replace an older metal plate model. I was enticed by the promise of shiny smooth hair as the package suggested (note to self: never believe a company's own hype). Sure, it heated up fast, but I had to put it to the highest setting to get it hot enough to work on my hair (loose curls, but fine texture). When I used it on my hair, however, it felt as if the plates were ripping my hair to shreds. The edges of the glass plates are rough, not smooth, which is a big no-no with hair styling appliances. Horrible, horrible, horrible product. I was surprised that this came from Conair, a well-known and long-lived maker of hair tools. I could have laid my wet hair under a set of rough bricks and achieved the same results."
1,This item STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this one because the one i been using which was bought at a beauty supply store and VERY EXPENSIVE was broken! someone dropped it on the floor. So i needed one fast since it was already 9:00 at night! well i had several to choose from and decided to get this one. Thinking that since it was a new product and the plates were made from glass it would work miracles. I was so disappointed when i used it! it wasn't that hot and when it put my hair through it it made this snapping noise like it was cutting my hair. when i was done the strip that i straightened was frizzy and it made it look like i had more split ends, UGLY!!! I put it back in the box and just blowed dried my hair with a round brush. Even that worked better.I gave it one star because at least it heated up in less then 60 seconds! :)"
2,Your hair will be straight...and on the floor!,"I bought this flat iron a couple of months ago as I was fascinated with its glass technology. My hair was pretty straight, but it also ripped out the ends. See, the glass isn't the only thing touching your hair; there is some kind of border (so you don't burn yourself I guess) around the glass, and the glass is glued in or something. There is too much friction between the glass and the border (it's not smooth there at ALL) so it rips your hair out. Also, whatever coating is around the border thing starts to come off, which is really making the surface harsh on hair. I stopped using mine (I only used it a few times) so I can keep my hair. I recommend upgrading to a ceramic ion flat iron. I guess when it comes to hair, higher prices do equal higher quality."
1,Purchase this if you want to become bald or 'frizzhead'!,"I purchased this glass straightener at the local Walgreens, for the price of $25.00. I do not use styling products often, but I did try this several times, only to notice it seems to not only fry my hair, but it breaks the hair off! It seems the hair can sometimes get caught somehow and just breaks off! And when you smooth your hair, yes, that does work, but it becomes somewhat frizzy, broken off. It actually damages your hair!Do not use this product, I hate to give a product such a terrible review, but I am so unhappy with this! It is truly bad for people with fine, fragile hair. So, either spend a little more money and buy a really good hair straightener (preferably not Conair) or get a perm! Just my two cents..."
4,Pretty Good!,"I bought this iron a number of years ago, used it for a while, and then moved to something big and bulky and forgot about this gem in the back of my cabinet under the sink.For the last year or two, I've been using an expensive CHI iron, but it has gradually burned (and pulled out!) my hair (the little gap between the plates and the structure, where it ""glides"" to make curls, would constantly snag my hair, and the temperature was too hot.I cleaned out my cabinet and found this guy again. Man, what a great tool. The faux-velvet flocking prevents my hair from snagging in the darn thing like the CHI, and the temperature controls let me keep it cool enough to not burn my fine, curly hair.I'm taking off a star because it feels a little plastic-ky, and it needs to be available in a larger size. Other than that, I'm reverting from my expensive CHI back to this mirrored star!"
4,Like it!,"I really like this iron. I've had one for a couple of years now and finally most of the flocking that surrounds the glass has worn off, so here I am to buy another one after trying two others. I have had no trouble at all with it pulling or breaking my hair. My favorite part is the flocking (kinda like a cheap velvet)as it guides my hair (straight but curls up at the ends, medium length and fine) through the iron so it comes out straight. With my iron that does't have a comb attached to the side my hair gets flattened in the way it goes into the iron, which isn't straight. The one with a comb on it totally rips my hair out. The downside to this iron (if you have longer hair) is that it is thin, I'd like to see it in a 1"" or even better 1.5"" size too."
3,Confusion....,"I received the item and i didn't get the carrying case,I only got a hard case that was a little broken. The Sax sung out nicely and was of okay quality, but I can't find the call number for the store, and I'm waiting on an email... I'll update later about it."
5,Loved it,My sister uses it all the time for work sooo happy with what i got from your company i tell everyone where i got it from
2,TOO SMALL!,Bought this so I could show my Eagles pride...too bad it is so small no one can see it.Just a cheap plastic clip with a paper decal..hope it doesn't peel off before the season is over.
3,Wanted Stone Relief Illustrations,"I once had a copy of the Ramakien when I was a child that included copies of rubbings of the stone relief pictures. This didn't have them, but all of the stories are still there."
3,Beware: Missing Pieces,"Grips fit great, had to drill a bigger hole in the spring holder so that grip pen could fit all the way through the pistol frame. Pin will not budge at all due to the downward force of the spring, which is a good thing if the same method is needed for other people. My only regret was that I only received one grip screw with the kit. On Youtube similar kits had two grip screws. Not sure if I received a used kit or if it was a error that happened at the factory. Had to go to the hardware store and buy two new screws so that the grip installation would look uniform upon completion."
2,"Resourceful, but not persuasive","This book tells us how location matters to astrology and how important for us to choose a good location to fulfill our wishes. The author's method is based on synastry between one's natal chart and that of a certain city, state, or nation. She recommends us to look at the links between our natal planets and ASC, MC or other important points of the location. The book also contains lists of lots of cities' birth data (not including birth time though). Though this book does not mention any of typical relocation methods, data themselves can be of great use."
4,Very Detailed,"I was most impressed with the scientifically based explanations that Glut gave in the book. it covers not only the most familiar dinosaur genera, but also explains some of the latest discoveries and shows the relationships of different types."
3,Gives good color ideas,I was hoping for more color choices on the wheel. It helps coordinate colors but only gives different shades of basic colors. It is good quality.
4,Helpful,"Helpful but not as helpful as I hope. I thought it would help me more with color selection but, but being unsophisticated with color it only helped a little."
5,Good color wheel,This color wheel has been very helpful. I use it a lot. It came in great shape and in great time.
4,Durable and useful,"Comes in a plastic binder sleeve for protection. Slides out easily for rotating the color palette, which is thorough without being overwhelming."
3,Just okay,"I think this is overpriced. Since I ordered this, I have found other color wheels that probably do the same thing for a more reasonable price."
2,Limited,I thought the color wheel would have more to it. I thought it was limited for what I needed it for.
1,way to simple,I was expecting something much more detailed with more colors. I got what it says I should get but I misunderstood what I was getting.
4,Very entertaining!,I bought this book on tape for my four-year old daughter. Every time we listen to it we laugh out loud and quote some of the lines. We have enjoyed it so much I am now buying the book so we can see the pictures! We find it quite hilarious. I understand the worry that it perpetuates stereotypes of hispanics and latinos because of the words used but I trust that my daughter will not make a leap to linking a fictional siamese cat and chihuahas to real people. To her it's just a funny story with great word sounds. To me it's an imaginative story about an adorable little cat who drives his mom crazy with his antics. An enthusiastic thumbs up!
5,Go Skippito,"This book is a gem. We discovered the second book first, ""In the Doghouse"" and then got this one too. Love them both! They are fun to read and they are my 3-year-old's favorites. She even likes to act out the stories. We ordered her the little Skippito stuffed animal, and I'm sure she'll be thrilled when she gets that in the mail too."
1,Agree - this is offensive,"Someone gave us this book, and within just a few minutes, I knew I did not want to read it to my son, nor did I want to keep it. We are a bi-lingual household, and this is NOT a good way to teach Spanish (there is none - just a degrading addition of ""-ito"" to words), and is not a good way to teach a child about another culture. It is demeaning and I'm concerned that so many actually like this book."
1,"Reading an accent is fine, but a fake accent with fake words?!?","Great illustrations, no plot, fake words, fake accent. No educational value at all. If your own kid makes up words pretending to be Mexican, that is one thing, but an adult author could actually learn some and should know better and use real Mexican or Spangelish words.If you like to make fun of people who are different, this is the book for you. I imagine the author meant no harm but was just being herself and doing that. Ignorance can be bliss."
1,No. No. No.,"Given the rampant stereotypes in this book, I assumed it was an artifact of the past century. I was astounded when I saw that the publication date was 2003, and not 1953. I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers who found this book inappropriate and disturbing, and can't possibly say it any better than they have.The only reason I am posting (and this is my first, and probably last, Amazon review) is to add my voice to the ""no"" camp. The number of 5-star reviews on here is depressing; are people really that oblivious? That this book wins awards and Amazon adulation is a stark reminder that we have a LONG way to go.Please, do yourself, your family, and society a tiny favor and do NOT spend money on this book."
1,"clever rhyming, but....","There's a lot to like about the Skyppyjon Jones series. The illustrations, the imaginative cat, the creative use of rhyme and rhythm. But, at the end of the day, I - like many others - am appalled by the explicit linguistic racism and stereotyping. Even my son's preschool teacher said she is uncomfortable with these books for that reason. It's a shame, really. SJJ could have been a classic. In a couple generations, it will (at best) be relegated to a shelf with Little Black Sambo as an example of racism in children's literature."
1,I hated this book,"This book is very offensive and full of stereotypes about Mexicans and Spanish-speaking people in general. I don't buy the argument that ""children know it's all pretend"" from people who, by the way, are also quick to tell everyone to ""lighten up"" even though we all know that racism starts many times through jokes. It's a shame that a clearly talented writer has to use such stale, embarrassing humor, but it's even more of a shame that this book is being touted as ""multicultural."""
1,Terrible book,I am surprised that so few people realize how bad and ultimately racist and stereotyping this book is. It was a gift and when I heard my husband read it to our daughter it shocked me how tasteless it is. Out the door it goes...
4,A captivating imaginative children's book!,"My little granddaughter was delighted by this book. She loved the rhymes and the Spanish phrases, since they are introducing some Spanish in her preschool classes. And she was very taken by Skippyjon, with his big head and personality.It is a charming, original book with captivating illustrations."
5,So funny I almost bought a second copy for myself,"Seriously, if this book catches on even a little, you may find legions of parents bowing before the author. It may inspire a following greater than J.K. Rowling, because the books don't come with annoying product tie-ins and marketing campaigns.This is, by far, the cutest book ever, and I intend to buy everything in this series that the author publishes."
5,book purchase,I ordered Skippyjon Jones. The book arrived quickly and no problems with seller. I think the book is absolutely adorable. I am very happy . I would recommend this lovely book to anty child.
5,Que bueno!,"This book is totally awesome! Children from 2-10 will love it, especially if you use your best Latino accent."
4,Charming!,"Give yourself plenty of time with some of these tongue-twisters, and have plenty of breath too... for those who do not speak Spanish (such as myself) the book is a wonderful read but challenging at first. I highly recommend it for those who want to encourage their children to be bilingual. A cute story!"
2,nice art...too bad about the racism,"My son enjoys this book quite a bit, and the pictures are adorable. Unfortunately, the exaggerated accents and stereotypical representations of Mexican culture are (as several earlier commentators have noted) clueless and offensive. If you like the drawings, I would strongly suggest getting one of her other books instead."
2,JUSTskipTHIS series OF BOOKS,I REALLY DON'T SEE WHY THE BOOK HAS SUCH HIGH REVIEWS! IT'S NOT A JOY TO READ... IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE! IT'S NOT EVEN SILLY OR FUN...I'VE READ IT MORE THAN ONCE JUST TO GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE TO EMBRACE THE IDEA RE: AN OUT OF CONTROLL KITTEN BUT AFTER REPEAT ATTEMPTS STILL CAN'T STAND THIS SERIES OF BOOK! I DON'T SEE WHAT KIDS GET OUT OF THIS STORY OF STUPID..... WE NOW HAVE A BOOK GRAVE YARD THANKS TO THIS SERIES!!!! IV'E CHANGED THIS STORY WHILE READING IT ADLIB ON THE SPOT TO HELP THIS BOOK GET THE KICK IT'S SO LACKING!!!
1,LEWD AND WEIRD,"horrible writing. every adult that reads her books can't stand it. these books are difficult to read with continuity and are un-enjoyable because of the strangeness about them. the main character is creepy and just plain weird. this book in particular has lewd writing such as 'put a pickle in his puss'. we had throw out the book because our kids' uncles, aunts, and grandparents all complained that the writing was too disgusting in several places. we all have no idea how this author got into publishing. aside from that, the kids are frightened by the characters. i would NOT recommend these books to anyone, especially children."
3,Skipppyjon Jones,"Skippyjon Jones is the story of a cat who appears to want to be anything but what heis, a Siamese cat. This story depicts an animal with a big imagination who first decides he is a bird, but when his mother sends him to his room to think about what he really is, he then pretends to be a Mexican Chichuahua. The book, in my opinion, has a TV cartoon quality which I think appeals to many children in the age group for which it is intended. Children also like the rhyming lines and the illustrations are very well done. I feel the underlying nuances, whether intentional or not, of relationships (a cat being with birds without thinking of them as a meal and a Siamese cat being a hero to a Mexican dog) is completely lost on the young child who reads or has this book read to him/her. Alma Winters, Author-ONCE UPON A TIME TALES."
3,I just can't get into it...,"I purchased this book after my daughter went to a book fair last fall and saw a life size Skippy walking around. The book had great reviews and seemed new and exciting. I have to tell you - this book is so hard to read. It doesn't make much sense and trying to pronounce the words drives me crazy.The premise of the Skippyjon books is that Skippy is a Siamese Cat that thinks that he is a Chihuahua. The premise is fantastic. However, when he is imagining he is a Chihuahua - the dialog is insane to try to read. I can hardly understand what is going on - so I can only imagine with my 4 year old is comprehending.I gave this book 3 stars because it is a favorite of my daughter and your child might enjoy it. As a mother, I personally can't stand it and I cringe every time she chooses this book."
5,Holy Guacamole! Our hero is Skippito!,"My 4-year old daughter, husband & I absolutely love this book! It's one I never get tired of reading! It is so funny, and the illustrations are terrific. One of the cutest books ever!!! Wonderful for the imagination. I highly recommend this book! My daughter gets so excited she can hardly wait for her bedtime story."
5,Most Entertaining,My daughter is 5 and she LOVES reading the Skippyjon Jones books. There are places where we giggle and clap. I read to her every night and since adding these books I actually enjoy the fun that comes off the page. My job as a parent is to make learning fun and entertaining - and these books are both. El Skipito to the rescue!!
5,Skippy jon Jones makes you laugh,"If you love cats, you'll thoroughly enjoy and identify with this wonderfully written book about a Siamese cat who thinks he's a bird. If you're not really a cat person, you'll fall in love with cats and equally enjoy this tale. I especially liked all the nicknames the mom has for her precocious little boy--all of us owned by cats have a variety of nicknames for our babies. Beautifully illustrated as well. I give it 5 stars, a 10 out of 10 rating!"
1,This book is offensive !!!!!,"This is the worst book I've ever read. We read the book in class where the students are librarians, elementary school teachers and people from different ethnic groups. Guess what happened? None of us liked the book, at all.The book portrays so many Mexican stereotypes and the language is excessively bad, with many made up words they don't even exist.Buy you children good books, not a book that makes fun of other ethnic groups in the US.Do you want your child to laugh and enjoy a Latino book? Buy: ""Abuelo and the three bears"", ""Borreguita and the Coyote"", ""The Empanadas that abuela made"", among many others.This book is very ofensive."
1,"Skippyjon Jones is not appropriate, nor ""multi-cultural""","Before I read this book to my kids, I would have wanted to know that the book was incredibly horrible. Who's writing the rave reviews out there? It's not only racist, but just plain bad. Adding -o doesn't make it Spanish, or exciting to read. It's lazy writing that depends on end rhymes and stereotypes to carry the plot along.I've never written a review for Amazon before, but seeing that this book was rated so highly really got me thinking. Are there any checks and balances to make sure Amazon book reviews aren't getting pumped up by authors, publishers, etc?"
2,No flow to it.,"Whether you think it's ""racist"" or not (I hate how that word is thrown around these days . . . racist means that you think your race is superior to all others, not that you can't point out differences among cultures) it's a substandard book. It looked so cute, so I bought it from a book order, but one reading had me tossing it aside. It rambles on, doees not strike me as funny in any way (and I am a great lover of books of all kinds), my 5-year-old son was not impressed. We are getting rid of this one."
1,too much for 5 year old,"After reading many reviews on this book, I thought this would be a good read for my 5 year old daughter. Boy was I wrong! This book was terrible. The rhyming was choppy and the storyline was hard to follow, even if you understood many of the Spanish words inside. The story itself was original, but the pictures on the pages where also all over the place as well as the words so my daughter lost her interest. A waste of money, I will not be buying any more books in this series."
1,Why is this book so popular?,"Thank you S. Martinez. Finally, a review that mirrors what I've been thinking ever since I first received a free copy of this book a couple years ago from the author at Book Expo America. Now I see it in stores, at book fairs and it receives nothing but rave reviews. Why? It is a fun concept and I can see how it would produce some laughs, but it does seem to be a lot like the Taco Bell dog. I'm not overly PC, but I still am trying to figure out how this book gets away with its characterizations. It's easy to see how people would find it offensive. I'm biased to the books we publish at Bubblegum Books, but this is the first negative review I've ever posted so it's not about being vindictive."
5,Wish I could give it more than 5 stars!,"This is a fantastic book! My 4 1/2 year old son received it for a holiday gift and it is a smash hit. He loves to hear it and it makes him want to learn to read! The best part is that I love to read it, too - so many books for kids are boring and/or tedious for adults to read. Not this one: it's a riot from cover to cover. And what fun to hear my son say, ""Holy guacamole!"" when he's surprised or excited about something. I plan to buy the rest of the series and the doll, too. Can't recommend this book highly enough!"
1,serious?,"one of the most socially acceptable forms of racisit literature i have ever read. and its for children.i have read thru 4 different skippyjonjones books and each just get worse and worse.not a book for my children.they do not need to be led to believe that mexicans are full of pinto beans and talk in broken english with everything ending in ""ito"" as portrayed in these books. author, you should be ashamed of yourself."
3,Good knife but I don't like the type of edge on the main blade,"Good, solid knife but the shape of the main (biggest) blade is ground so that you cannot easily cut fruits. The grind leaves a big, solid back instead of a gradual taper, like the other blades. This does strengthen it but at the expense of smooth cutting. For this reason I use an Opinel instead and this knife sits in my dresser drawer."
1,Not acceptable,"If you want a Buck knife, get one made in the USA instead of this piece of junk made in RED COMMUNIST China."
4,Decent but really short...,"Solid gameplay overall. The bosses are a bit easy to beat even on the hardest level, but there is a lot of action during the levels. It's a classic sidescroller fighter. My only complaint is that the game is a bit too short, but it does have replay value."
5,Best Documentary on Film,"Gendun Choephel was a true Mahatma and visionary ahead of its time. This film reflects on his mystical explorations, daring travels, and spiritual challenges. The documentary is superb, yet fails to demonstrate how the Communist Chinese unjustly assassinated hundreds of thousands of innocent Monks while forcing them to perform inhumane atrocities!! Where is the UN and the Vatican on this?Unfortunately, Tibet will never be free again as the US and Britain failed to assist the spiritual center of the world during their turmoil invasion. Forthe record, this marvelous nation is also known as Shangri-La. Sadly, the US has now entered into a ""Covenant with the Enemy"" Chinese nation and this harm will bring due Karma at its destine time..."
5,classic,Victoria Abril and Marisa Paredes are at their best in this movie investigation of human contradictions allotted to each character
3,Just ok,"When I saw this product from Peg for only $19.99, I thought what a bargain considering the highchair was almost $200.00. Turns out it really is only worth $19.99, if that. I thought the toys were fairly boring, although I forgot that 8 months old find even the most mundane looking things fascinating. So it does provide some entertainment when he is hanging out for a bit in the highchair while I prepare dinner. However, because the Prima Pappa tray is set rather high, this also makes the farthest part of the Activity Tray inaccessible for him (hopefully just until he gets taller). Also the telephone cord doesn't reach very far, so it's all he can do just to hold it--it certainly doesn't reach to his ear or even face. All in all, it's ok---provided it doesn't cost more than $20---because babies and toddlers find fun in almost anything. Peg Perego should come out with something better, and redesign the highchair tray so that it's not so high up."
4,Great Mealtime Entertainer,"At first, I wasn't sure if I'd made a mistake in buying this. But, my daughter loves it! She has played with it since she was about six months old. Now, she's nine months old and it still keeps her entertained. It has made mealtime more enjoyable for all of us! Also, it is easy to install and remove from the tray."
2,Kind of a Waste of Money,"Okay, so I wanted my daughter to get used to her Peg Perego High chair on a playtime level so that she can be in the kitchen with me while I'm cooking even when I'm not feeding her. I thought this would be great since it's the ONLY accessory for this highchair that you can get. Couple problems with it: (1) it rests vertically on the tray instead of horizontally so my 6 month old can't reach past the first dail and lever. The way it's pictured is not the way it's mounted on your chair. Imagine the pink dial at your baby's hands and the green phone above that, etc. (2) the actual toys are kind of weak. the dial is the only thing that makes sounds and the rest of the buttons can barely be pressed. Maybe when she's older, she can pretend something with it, but if you're purchasing this for an infant, my suggestion is put your baby's toys on the tray and leave this toy alone."
1,Don't get it near food.,"So, I've had this thing for a few weeks. My only suggestion - don't get it near baby food.It's a high-chair tray, but apparently you should use it only when your little one is sitting there watching you eat. Because if he eats, and gets any gunk on it (which every baby will), it will ruin the little paper stickers that are all over the tray. Which kind of ruins the ""niceness"" of the tray. I would recommend that you just skip it, and put a few plastic toys on a regular tray. Not worth it."
1,Activity Tray disappointment,"I ordered this for our Prima Pappa Diner chair. With the photos provided i thought it looked great but was disappointed to find that the 4 buttons near the top had no real function, the phone had a very short cord and could not be used as pretend phone, and the clock had no sound when turning the hands.Would not recommend this unit!"
4,Not too bad,"The book, itself, is well-written. It is a very good tool for a budding creative writer to refer to, when needed. I do not, however, think it is worth the +/- $60 price tag it carries. I'd pay $25 tops for this book and wouldn't have gotten it if it wasn't required for a class."
2,Crossroads,"I know the the book was used, but the cover was nasty with some kind of food on the front and back cover."
5,Good Textbook,This book was a good purchase for my class. It was cheaper than at my school's bookstore and I only needed it for a 5 day intersession course.
2,not the same,this game is pretty fun but they could have made it alot better.OK it [stinks] I mean all you do is go straight and kill people and that gets really boring after a while.It's like super mario but with spideys powers the bosses are really easy too I mean all you do is web them up and hit them. Don't buy this game ...
2,The easiest game I have ever played!,"It's all over in a matter of minutes seriously. The game involves Spidey going out to buy Mary-Jane a fishbowl but he gets caught up in rumble downtown as several of his enemies run riot. It's up to him to sort them out.In 7 very short levels the game is over. And you'll be left with your jaw hanging open that a game can be so easy. The beat-em-up aspect of the game is pretty lame, all the bad guys look the same, the music is often bland, the level design is dated and the gameplay even less engaging than Spider-Man vs the Kingpin on the Sega Genesis 10 years previous.If you see this game on sale for a matter of pennies then go for it. Otherwise avoid!Graphics CSound CGameplay CLasting Appeal D-"
5,Spidey's Back,"The web crawler is back to catch Mysterio in this game for GBA. You could climb up walls and swing through the city on sky scrapers, and save the city from Mysterio master plans of taking it over."
5,THE BEST!!,"This is a definite classic. The best out there. It has the new Advanced Game Boy graphics. You will find 3-d things in it. The game play is astonishing. I have beaten it twice but I still find it fun to play because of all of the moves. It comes with fighting combos that are much easier than the Mortal Kombat combos that require things like left-right-jump-punch-left-down. It has good replay quality because the difficulty level is alot harder when changed. I highly recommend this instant classic to be the first game you buy. It was my first game for it and I am not sorry. So if you like scrolling action, fighting and adventure then buy it now."
3,Pretty good game,This is a very good game. But there are some downpoints. I've played this game for about an hour and I'm on the last level. And the easy mode and normal mode are too easy but the hard mode is too difficult. I'd recommend this game ages six to ten.
4,gamer since 1988,This game is great because it focus on the master of illusions Mysterio. This game has nice graphics and very fun to play. The only bad thing is that it has only 7 short levels. That why I haven't given it a 5 stars.
2,no no no,"This game is not good, I dont know what these other reviewers are on. I am not a serious gamer and bought this with my GBA, its the 1st game I since I was a kid (quite a few years back) and was planning on using it to kill a long plane journy. I thought I would test out the GBA by having a go but when it was finished in 45 min I though I had waisted my time and I wont be touching it again. Walk up to someone pres 3 times they die, walk up to someone press again they die repeat repeat repeat."
4,"Great, Fun Game!","PROS:AWESOME gameplay.Great graphics for GBADetailed levelsCONS:NO game slot saves (just passwords)boring musicGraphics: B+Gameplay: ASound: B-Presentation+Options: A-OVERALL: Nice, fun game."
3,Not As Good As SpiderMan: the movie,"My previous review on this was titled,HERE'S SPIDEY! It said that it is very fun n' stuff, but after I played Spiderman: the movie, on the PC, I discovered that I was very, very wrong.This game is 2D, while the other game is MUCH more relistic, and is 3D.The other one is based on the movie, while this is not. I can't get too upset about the sound, because this game is for Gameboy Advance, while I played the movie-based one on the PC, but, the sounds are VERY repeditive."
3,Spidey Redux,"Spiderman's first outing on the GBA, delivers as much it needs too but not enough to satisfy. In the 7 odd playable levels each a multistage adventure in its own right, Spidey swings, jumps, fights and dodges his way into familiar territory.Sharp, crisp graphics, engaging enough sound and tight control do a lot to keep this title's head above water. Though only just make up for the lacking plot and all too brief experience.Fans and platform junkies; please form a queue to the right, the sceptics can just pass this title by."
4,Here's Spidey!,"I got this game, using my $25 gift certificate, and I love it! A cheat that you can type in at the password area is sp1dy (spidy, except the i is a 1). It gets you the 7 extra web containers,(maximum), a thermal suit, and the SYMBOITE suit. What is the symboite suit? It gradually REFILLS YOUR HEALTH AND WEB METER!"
3,Fun Game,"It is fun, but extremely short. Borrow it, don't buy it, because it is a waste of money. You can beat it between 1-3 hours depending on how skilled you are. There are only 7 levels."
4,web slinging fun,"The best spidey side scroller. The best game was the spiderman for the higher platforms (roaming in 3-D) but this is a close second. The graphics flow smoothly and are colorful. the comic book sequences look great. the gameply is fun. the sound is good. the replay value is not bad. it is a side-scroller. my only annoyance, not being able to hang straight down from a web attached to the ceiling. a small inconvienience, but this is one of the best spiderman games I've played. A must have for spiderman fans!"
4,This game was fantasctic,"I got this game and it was great. But for people that are reading this who have a nintendo ds, listen up. If you put in the ds version of spiderman 2 while game boy advance wirsion of Mysterio's menace is in aswell, you will be able to unlock all of spidey's moves."
4,This game is pretty good,"I thought this game was okay. There's three different levels you can choose- Easy, Normal, and Superhero. After awhile, this game gets kind of boring. There's not many stages to go through, and it isn't 3D.If you like Spiderman alot, then you should try this game. First thought, you should borrow it from a friend or rent it. Overall, this is an okay game."
5,Complete Aubrey/Maturin Novels,"These novels are deatiled with historical facts,and decribes life aboard man of war ships circa 1800. It was also interesting to learn that England and other countries were in the spy business during these years. Many years of research had to be completed to provide the intricate details of life, death and battle engagements."
2,Editing? What editing?,"Though the story is outstanding, and the general appearance of this set is very good, the editing is almost non exsistant. I have found the number 1 in place of a capital I, incorrect punctuation, paragraphs blended together, completely misspelled words or the incorrect word altogether. I am still enjoying the read, but for what it is, the set is substandard."
2,Disgraceful typesetting,"Although the novels are of course magnificent, the typesetting of this collection is the worst I've ever seen in professional publishing. The quality varies substantially. Ten or twenty pages may pass with few noticable errors, to be followed by ten or twenty more with three or four howlers per page.The publishers should be ashamed of themselves. A fine author brought by the lee by lubberly work!Follow the advice of others and buy the earlier single volume editions."
2,My poor rating is for this published edition of a brilliant series and not for the author's content,"A brilliant work of literature, poorly published. The publisher gets 2 stars for selecting wonderful content, using a decent typeface and providing an omnibus edition which is quite needed. And that's all. Barely proofread at all, there are numerous typo's evident to folks who have read these books previously. Difficult to tell who is saying what because of the way ""voices"" are presented.If you have the books already and you're not heading off on some interstellar travel where storage space would be a consideration, stick with what you have already.If you have never read the Aubrey/Maturin novels, pick an earlier edition. Truly they're wonderful. The man was a brilliant writer with an unsurpassed command of prose."
5,patrick o'brian novels,my favorite books of all time (have read 1000s). they never get old. read and re read and enjoy for a lifetime.
2,"Good stories, poor package","Print is too small, pages are too thin and books are too thick to hold.Good stories, buy the paperbacks."
2,A disappointment,"I bought the series after I read the good reviews from Amazon. Having only 2 Patrick O'Brian's books, I thought this would be a good buy to read all his Aubrey-Maturin novels. The collection despite its economical price has very bad editing. There are numerous typos, misspelled words, misquotations and missing words.Quite a disappointment. Shoddy work from Norton's editor."
5,master and commander,The Aubrey/Maturin series are the greastest collection of novels that I have had the honor to read.Obrian has created characters that almost live and breath.I have read all the napolianic war naval writers and I believe Obrian to be the very best! Long live Jack Aubrey and Steven Maturin!
5,Patrick O'Brian Aubrey & Maturin Collection,A very good value collection. Each volume holds four books in sequence and are physically quite large but seem to be well bound with clear print on thinnish pages.The text has a small number of typographical errors that I don't remember seeing in the original books but to get the entire collection of O'Brian's Aubrey novels in one set for such a reasonable price I'm prepared to put up with the odd blooper. The ribbon bookmark is a very cute bonus and will certainly stop me from dog-earing the pages.
3,"great series, ridiculous number of typos","wonderful stories to be sure, but i think the editors were either illiterate or blind, because the number of typos is ridiculous and also consistent, throughout the latter half of the books, the butler at woolcombe is called mnason, ive never heard of an english name like that... or someone being called horner at one point and homer at another, they mix up rn and m quite frequently... still, despite its shortcomings, its cheaper to decode it and have htem all than buy them all seperately."
3,Typographical eye-strain,"I'll rate this collection at three stars because the story is amazing. The books appear to be well constructed and solid. I'm convinced they will last longer than I will! However, the appalling amount of typographical errors is really annoying! Just about the time I get myself thoroughly transported through time to another world my eye skips over another typo and trips my suspension of disbelief. I've only read through the first two volumes of this set and I can't even begin to count the glaring errors. I certainly hope the publishers will re-issue this set of books after some careful editing."
3,Poor Proof Reading,"For those that are familiar with them, the books in this set are similar to The Library Of America editions of the American classics (both are printed and bound by the same company, R.R. Donnelly & Sons). Although the paper is necessarily thin these editions are much better quality than the British individual hardbacks.The reason for the poor rating is not for the quality of the books, nor of course for what they contain, but for the very poor type-setting and proof reading. I picked up a re-reading of the novels at 'The Mauritius Command' and it has numerous misprints, sometimes two or three a page, and is simply the worst book have read for type-setting errors. Subsequent novels are better but still may have half a dozen or more misprints.Those wishing to replace their paperbacks with this set would probably be wise to wait for a second edition; maybe this won't be long coming, as W.W. Norton should be embarrassed by this one."
3,"good camera, inconvenient size","This camera is of good quality, and user friendly with a little instruction as to which button does what. However, the size is really inconvenient. Especially to a woman who needs to carry it around in her purse. While there are special cases to carry it in, for a person who can't lug a bunch of camera equipment all day...I can tell you that I can't take it many places. Forget formal functions...you can't carry it in an evening bag or clutch, and a big black shoulder pack looks rather silly with a dress. Or for a younger person, say a teenager, there's no way they can juggle it at school. And many of the digital cameras are being sold to teens who want to take them everywhere. If you can carry a larger camera then the quality is just fine...good zoom capability, simple buttons, and a variety of options...but if you can't tote it...don't buy it."
5,The one MTG book that has stood the test of time,"Most Magic books do not age well. I am to say that this one has. Granted, none of the more recent cards are in the book, but it still makes a great primer to learn on Magic's permanent decktypes. It's Type 1 decks are still valid to look thru. The ingenuity of other deck types will encourage new players how to look at various deck styles. If you can find a copy, buy it."
5,it's not REAL you crazy people!,"First of all, after I read these reviews I was SHOCKED. This book is in the HUMOR section! there's absolutely no scientific basis... it's just all in fun! I give it 5 stars for the good laugh it gave me!"
2,Cute Gizmo,"This product is cute and not a bad value for the money. For reasons that I don't understand, you must look at certain types of lights for them to work - not just any light will do. When I first tried them on, I could not see what I was supposed to. After finding a pair in a retail store and looking at small Christmas tree lights with them, I easily saw what I was supposed to."
5,Good book,This product is same as described in purchase. Delivery was very quickly and good conditions. I recommend this product and provider. Sincerely. Jose Pena
4,"Very stylish set of speakers, lacking in the mid department","73Watt RMS continuous and 100 Watt RMS Peak sounds great. Speakers really have a great look to them. Don't take up much space at all. Decent Base and treble, though the mid range department is a lil lacking..YOu might find yourself tweaking your card or software equalizers to produce a decent mid range sound. Luckily I have additional Mid range speakers connected to this system to compensate for this (using a Channel Splitter)I am def. happy with this purchase and for only R799, you won't have to break the bank."
2,This speaker system is a waste of time and money,THE ALTEC LANSING ACS48 IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. THIS MAY LOOK POWERFUL BUT IT STRAINS WHEN IT IS PLAYED LOUDLY UNLIKE THE ALTEC LANSING 641 AND THE ACS48
3,Big But Mixed Bag,"There is a huge quantity of stuff here, but I have reservations about the context in some situations, because at times you only hear the response Jimi or someone else gives, not the question and not the flow of the conversation. Again, this is a problem part of the time and not the majority of the time. Also, I would have appreciated more factual background, such as who the interviewer was, the date, etc. Given those caveats, I'm still happy I have it because there are quotes about the direction he was headed when he died that I don't recall hearing or reading previously. Since there are four CDs, you're getting a load of material here, but if you have to pay retail, you better want this bad."
4,Welcome to Dredg,"Dredg is among a large group of under-appreciated art-musicians who offer the music scene a unique style and message. Though beautiful and provocative, the band's sound can often seem almost inaccessible upon first impression.""Live at the Fillmore"" is a great introduction into the depth of the music that this band has to offer. With the raw energy of their debut ""Leitmotif,"" the artistic graces of ""El Cielo,"" and the pleasant, main-stream approximations of ""Catch Without Arms,"" this album is guaranteed to interest, stimulate, and impress listeners from a wide range of musical tastes and backgrounds."
3,New track and greatest hits format not enough to reach the level of their studio albums,"I don't like live albums. So I'm biased here. Dredg is my favorite band, moreso even than Tool. And even with a new track or two on this album, it didn't reach me on the same level as their studio albums. I've seen Dredg live in concert and it was a great experience, so I would still recommend seeing them live. If you're a newcomer who is looking to get into dredg, I'd recommend buying their studio albums, probably El Cielo fist, then Leitmotif, and Catch Without Arms. As for hardcore fans, I still wouldn't recommend this album unless you love live albums or you can't get the track ""Stone by Stone"" anywhere else. Dredg is the best, and this is a great compilation of their most rockin' tunes for only $9.99, but I'd say stick with the studio albums."
3,Barely progressive...,"Dredg has an excellent, polished sound, but falls short of what I consider ""progressive"" rock. Music is good, but not terribly complex,and really lacking harmony vocal parts that I think would be a positive to the style. To my ears has they have a lot in common with the UK band, Marillion. Vocal and musical stylings are similar, at least for my early impressions of Dredg.This CD is very listenable for a live recording, and I think the band's fan base will continue to grow. Good luck, guys!"
5,Great quality sound for a live CD,"Okay so I dont usually buy live CD's due to the fact that the sound often sucks, or that the audience cheering/shouting etc. etc gets in the way of the actual music. Not so in this case. I was really impressed by the clarity and quality of the music on this CD, but that might be a bit biased because dredg is easily my favourite band of all time. Ive listened to this CD so many times and the tracks Sang Real, Same Ol' Road and the closing songs Yatahazee and 90 Hr Sleep are definite standouts. It was also nice to hear otherwise unreleased music with Stone by Stone and a short intro, The Warbler.This CD very much focuses on the songs itself and the tracks cut off after each song to skip to the next one. This isn't such annoyance though. I recommend this CD to anyone who values quality live recordings and awesome music from an awesome band;) Next thing dredg need to do is release a live DVD!"
5,Does what I expected,"First time owning an espresso maker, and this little guy does what i had hoped--pack the espresso evenly. It's very solid--probably the last one i'll ever need to own. very happy."
3,Not as great for the Delonghi EC-155 as expected,"Item arrived promptly & in good shape but the tamper is a little too small for the Delonghi EC-155 contrary to what other reviewers stated, it is actually smaller than the one included with the unit which is small to begin with, the tamper is of course better than that one but coffee squeezes up about .5 cm from the edge of the basket which is rather annoying when attempting to create an even pack."
2,Not 49mm,"Arrived today. I may end up just returning it because it's too small - more like 47mm, 48 max. Not 49 as claimed. Basket on my machine is 50-51mm..."
5,Perfect my espresso machine,"I have been trying to find a tamper to fit an old espresso machine that I have, but most have been too large. This is the perfect size and makes life so much easier. Quality is fine and it has a good weight too."
5,Great tamper,"Good heft, polished, red dot is a nice touch, and feels nice. Recommended over the other tampers. Same item with blue dot is available but was more expensive for some reason, probably different store."
2,too small,This tamp is not a commercial tamp and was too small for our nuova simonelli aurelia porta filters. May be good for home espresso machines but will not work for commercial machines.
2,"Works, but looks like crap.","This arrived very early, but the red jewel at the top was cracked. It works, but it doesn't look good. So, if you're superficial and into looks, this isn't for you. But if you want a cheap tamper that works moderately well for your machine, this is the one for you. Zombiejesus out."
5,Perfect tamper for the EC155,"This stainless steel tamper is the perfect size for the portafilter on the DeLonghi EC155. Being solid, not hollow, it has a very substantial feel to it."
3,Owner of a Breville,"I bought this tamper based on another reviewer mentioning it works with his Breville espresso maker. It works, but is a bit small. In the future I will buy a 53mm tamper so that I won't have to go ""tamp tamp tamp!"" around all the sides of my portafilter.The tamper has a little heft to it, and is bottom heavy, but feels hollowed out in the top portion to me. It's better than the plastic tamper I had before, and worth the few dollars to get me through till I find a better one. Does anyone have a suggestion for me? Please respond to this review and I will get an e-mail. Thanks!The red accent works for my kitchen, but I was tempted to go with the silver from another seller. Based on reviews of that seller's product coming rusted (I have no way to confirm that) I went with this one. I can tell you that mine came rust/scratch free and I have no qualms with using it."
2,Not 49mm,"This tamper is a good fair priced tamper. The only problem is that it is only 47.5mm. It may not seem like a lot, but a mm can make a huge difference in your espresso. Also it's not completely flat, its slightly rounded on the bottom and the edges are rounded. The problem with this is that when you tamp, the grounds go up the sides and overflow over the edge of the filter basket. I would not recommend buying this tamper unless your basket is 48mm."
5,Works great,I bought this to go with my De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker. It is the perfect fit. I like the decorative handle. No complaints.
2,Suitable for 10 year olds,"There's just not much to this that anyone who thought about robots for 30 minutes couldn't have figured out. I would recommend it for 10 year olds, or thereabouts. The graphic design is nice at least.Also, it's sort of the same book as the Zombie Survival Guide, sans zombies and such."
5,Fun and smart!,"This is a nice piece of bathroom literature.It does a really good job of threading the needle between assuming the audience knows too much and the audience knowing too little, which is absolutely essential to humor of this kind.There are enough asides and subtle references to keep it conversational as well and will get you to smile and think a pretty good bit.If you are a fan of 2001, Terminator, Iron Giant, Fast Cheap and Out of Control, or any other kind of sci-fi involving robots, OR The Zombie Survival Guide, I can recommend this without apprehension."
3,Leave more to the imagination,"When I first came upon this book I thought ""what would I need this for?"". Then I got into lucid dreaming where I can control my dreams. I decided to use some of these tactics to defeat the robotic armies that frequently cause my nocturnal emissions testing centers. Boy was I surprised when I first encountered a legion of robots looking for trouble. I was easily able to overcome the robots (I cheated with cybernetics) and spent the rest of the dream flying, falling, randomly jumping around to unconnected and illogical periods in my life etc... Each time I landed in a the hallway from breakfast club or the top of skyscraper in Tokyo, there was not one damn robot assassin lurking anywhere. This book works but YOU have to the all the leg work. I wish I had this years ago when I always fell or kept running in place like a GTA glitch, that was really frustrating."
2,We're all doomed,"The basic message of this book is that, unless you have access to an EMP bomb, you are screwed. Maybe that's accurate, but I'd like to think we have other resources that might give us a fighting chance. I wish the book had explored more options/possibilities. A robot uprising is far more likely than a zombie uprising, of course, and I'm sure will be more difficult to deal with; given that, this guide isn't really any help."
4,Gift,I bought this as a gift for my roommate. She was pleased and quite amused. She's a big sci-fi fan so I was pretty sure it was going to be a hit.
4,Informative if a Bit Slight,"This is an entertaining and informative book written by a guy who clearly knows plenty about robots. It's a bit short for the money, perhaps. With all its little drawings and graphics, is it designed to be a coffee table book? And if so then why is it so small? I think I'd have preferred either a full-on graphic novel or a cheaper print edition. But I'm griping about the price, not the content itself."
3,Not as funny as I had hoped,"As a CMU alumni and having taken several classes and worked in the robotics department, I felt obligated to get this book, and I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I found the book's title and premise far more amusing than the contents of the book. Perhaps my expectations where too high, but I did not find the book nearly as humorous as I had hoped."
1,I can't believe I bought this book,"I expected a serious discussion of surviving in a Post-singularity world and instead this book is a flip and comedic riff. Nothing informative here at all. Seeing the used price on Amazon, I need to dig out my copy and sell it unless I have already thrown it out."
4,Very funny and educational,"The book's theme is pretty obvious from the title. What makes this book interesting is a robotics expert wrote it, so the book is both funny and educational.He takes the many cliches in robot disaster movies and shows what robots can and cannot do, by presenting the reality of robots against the fantasy versions.Because of this, you can learn a lot about the current state of robotics from this book. It's also an engaging read, written in a half-funny, half-serious style where robotics knowledge comes in bite-sized chunks in a survivial guide format.If you enjoy sci-fi, want to know a bit more about robotics, understand robot's limitations and want a good laugh along the way, this book is a great fast read.Frankly, what scares me more about robots are (a) the inevitable bugs in the software and (b) hackers who takeover robots to do their bidding. If PCs have taught us anything, both (a) and (b) are inevitable."
3,Amusing,"I did enjoy this survival guide, and found it amusing. The author seemed knowledgable about robotics, and appears to have enough research to give this book enought depth to make it entertaining."
2,boring...,"I had high hopes for this book, but was let down. It's not all that funny. It kind of just lists different types of robots that companies like IBM, ATR, etc have made. As far as the ""tips on defending yourself against the coming rebellion"" forget it; just throw this book at the robot and hope it finds robotic history interesting."
3,"Could have been better, but worth it","While it isn't written in the most exciting of tones, it does provide information for those who have a interest in robots but know nothing about them. For those who aren't so uninformed, this is a pass, but for everyone else, either borrow it or buy it and sell it when you're done."
4,Primer and good humor,"This books provides much of what a person would need should there be a need to face a robot one on one. It was a great read, though I found it to go by too quickly."
2,Not Much There,"This is cute, but it is no Zombie Survival Guide. There is very little in the way of step by step instruction, and it is more of an outline that a survival guide."
4,Defend yourself,"In the ever looming robot uprising, we now have a book to help survive this inevitable event. Daniel Wilson gives us a straightfaced humorous book on what, where, and how the robot uprising is going to take place. Good thing Wilson is a PhD candidate in robotics and data mining, thus he knows what he's talking about in this entirely plausible, yet lighthearted, possibilities. He explains the rudimentary functions and purposes of our robots as well as, albeit simplistic temrinology, ways to defeat them.With this book and the Zombie Survival Guide, we have some of our bases covered for future uprisings and revolts. Well worth the read and the book looks great. Gloss pages, great cover art (mine is the one with Optimus Prime silhouette), and the pages (on mine anyway) are red metallic leafing... very handsome book (wow that statement is wrong in so many ways). Pick it up, defend yourself, and ensure your survival!"
2,Would Not Use for Class Again,"I am an instructor, and I've been teaching first-year college writing for five years now. I have experimented with several methods and texts, and this book was recommended to me, so I tried it. I am not at all pleased. Most of my students complained about having to read it, and I couldn't really fault them. As they pointed out, the tone is ""childish"" and the book is repetitive. It treats them at a level far beneath their abilities, and the readings included were not very helpful or challenging. In all, it has some clear sections (Profile, Newspaper, Argument) that some may find helpful, but I think it aims way beneath the needed level of intelligence to engage students in thinking and writing at an advanced level."
1,max's review,"I thought this CD was a horrible deal. It had 11 songs, most of which I weren't interested in, on it. The only real reason I bought it was to find out the names of the songs in the movie that i thought were good. If i had found them somewhere on the net then i would of just downloaded the mp3 from some place. So don't buy this CD. Just find someone that has a CD burner and burn you the good songs which are like only 4 of the 11. I have pretty good taste in music too. Also the movie was so crappy and I admit that I like some bad movies and this was worse than bad."
5,Four for The Congo's and 1 for the rest,"The CD is OK, but what makes it really worth buying is ""Don't blame it on I"" I consider that the best song on the entire CD. For all I know it IS the best song on the CD, but that's just because it is so damn nice to those little two ears of yours."
4,Help me,"Hi Everyone ,Please can you tell me what music it was when Jet Li was fighting with the two blokes at the end. Thanks."
2,EA should be ashamed,"This is EXACTLY the same game as last year for all practical purposes. The rosters were updated but still outdated, the ""Classic Madden"" mode gets really old really fast, and the Houston Texans are there but they're not available in anything but exhibition games as far as I can tell. Save yourself some money and get Madden 2001 and spend a bit of time updating the rosters."
4,Madden Is OK.,Going to madden 2002 from 2001 is no big change but still a good game to play when bored. it could have been better graphics but it's just fine.
5,Madden 2002,This is a Great game. you are able to run your team how you want and keep playing year after year. It isnt like other games where you just play one season and ends there. You can play as many seasons as you wnat and the players get better (or certain ones). It also has the madden cards and the great games.
3,Ok But EA got very lazy on this one,I rented this game at the video store and couldn't wait to play it. I got it goin and I saw no difference in the game from a year ago with the exception of up-dated rosters. I personally would play 2001 over 2002 any day of the week. However the gameplay was not bad and I did have fun playing it... For about an hour. Once you get the hang of it it becomes so boring and easy even on the most difficult level. Even though all this is true this is probably the best football game on the playstation. Us dedicated PS1 players are now inferior to those with PS2.
3,Madden 2002=Madden 2001 with much smoother gameplay,"I love madden 2002, its a lot like 2001 but has much smoother gameplay. The sound still leaves something to be desired, but the player management is better than ever."
4,Madden has done it again!!!,"I bought this game because of all the hype with it, I love it, but it does have a coupel of flaws, 1, Player Introductions would be a nice addition to this game and also the commentary does repeat itself, but overall it is a nice game for the PSone, the graphics are better, and the trash talking the players say to one another is pretty funny. I recommend this game for any football gamer out there, I can't wait until 2003 comes out."
4,excelent game,"for those of u who actually play for a real orginzed team,i do,i play for a youth team,this is exactly like real fottball.but it would be nice if in franchise actually conduct practice,that would be nice,butif u say this game is not reallistic u r wrong.play for a ral team,not backyard and see how realisictic this game is."
1,False advertising,"More like a fistful of horse pucky. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Terence Hill is not in any of these, nor are these ""Trinity"" films. Tried to watch 2 of them...couldn't get past the first 12 minutes. Checked the other two...Bud Spencer headlines, with no Terence Hill. Decided those two were probably as horrible as the first two, so I didn't even watch them."
3,It is pleasent to read but might be too textual for some,"This book, a text book syle in my eyes tries to educate the reader about prison style living and the authors own view on life. He expects us to adopt it just because we are reading his book. Although this is my view I also believe that the book is extremely well written, easy to read and keeps the interest of the reader. Above all I would reccomend the book to anyone who enyoys reading and wants to feel as though the author is having a personal conversation with the reader."
3,AWWWW...I'ts OK.....,"Just doesn't sit right with me that Mr. Mason is playing ELECTRONIC DRUMS!...This coming from the man who amazed and electrified us naturally with his work on ""Headhunters"" for cripes sake!! (doesn't sit right at all)He does a very decent cover of Paul Desmon's ""Take Five"" here, in fact, this and Grover Washington Jr.'s version are just about the best covers of ""TF"" I've heard so far. (no matter what that other reviewer says!)Fans of Fourplay, Special Effects & The Rippingtons should enjoy this one.Decent tracks - ""Take Five""""8:22 A.M""""Whatever It Is""""Take It Slow"""
4,Very romantic,"I bought it right after release date, was listening often. Nice rythmic combinanations, easy listening smooth jazz harmony.Dont like the Take 5, hate it's first.""It's you"", ""Ratamacue"" and ""8.22"" - the best three.Good combination of digital and analog sound.European type of music, no honey, sugar, just cool smooth jazz.Drive and enjoy!(Jazz keyboardist, Vitali Kirk)"
4,Get a copy................,"It's little wonder why after all these years Harvey Mason is still the most sort after drummer! ""Ratamacue"" is a piece of work, I can't say enough about this cd. It stands out! I searched for it for about a year here in the UK & had to get the help of Jazz FM in my desperation! Do yourself a favour, get a copy & never lend it out. It's as good as you'll get, don't just listen, this really needs to be heard!!"
2,Take Five in 4/4? No thanks!,"Take Five done in 4/4 time? Give me a break! That's blasphemy. They took the phrase that should have taken one measure of 5/4 and slowed it down to take two measures of 4/4. There is some nice drumming about half way through the song, but that's not enough to redeem it. This is the kind of nonsense that gives ""Smooth Jazz"" a bad name. The classic song has been rendered into Muzak."
2,GRP Fuzak,"I'm not a big fan of this style of music.Reminds me too much of the ""quiet storm"" format.Sounds dated,derivative and MOR.Kind of a waste of his talent,but ya gotta eat.He's done better and I would look elsewhere for a jazz/drum fix.Funk in a Mason Jar and Lee Rittenour's Capitan Fingers are better bets."
1,I don't understand why he is so famous,I have more than 5 Cd's by him. He is disappointing all the time.His music doesn't have any enthusiasm. He doens't do his best.no scrifice..I won't listen to his music any more.. ever.
1,Very disappointing -- expected motivational short stories,"I expected a motivational book about mental, emotional and physical health for RE agents in the trenches, and got a new age manifesto of no use to me. I love all of Barb's other books on RE -- she is a gifted teacher. But in this book she has strayed from her area of expertise into personal, subjective, and in some cases just strange ideas about how one should live. Her thoughts on health are untested and experimental, and her musings on spirituality are so nebulous that she ends up saying nothing of import in that section. Too bad; I know she has many stories that would encourage and motivate many of us to better things."
2,Some Times It Works Some Times It Doesn't,"These seat release handles did not fit my 1998 Chevy S-10 even though the check window said they would work. Had to do some grinding with my dremel to make them work. Buyer Beware, this is the first Dorman product that disappointed me."
3,"Did the trick, with modification",I got this for my S10 after the seat handle broke. It does come in a set of 2 and they seem good quality.However the screws it came with were a bit too short to stay fastened into the seat hardware.So after a quick trip to the hardware store for longer screws I got it installed and has been working great ever since.May have just been my truck that was the issue but now you know in case you need to do the same thing. Quick and easy fix.
2,too hard,My family and I love Scooby Doo but this was simply too difficult for my kids (5 and 8). They became too frustrated and gave up. I'm not much of a gamer but thought I'd give it a go until I also became frustrated. Perhaps with more experience at playing these kinds of games this would be more fun but for now it was just too hard
1,i don't recommend this game,this was my first gameboy game and i'm a big scooby doo fan. it was very disappointing and discouraging. i could not get to any levels after level 3 and whatever i tried i always got killed.it's a little bit fun at the beginning but i don't recommend spending your money on it. i am 7 years old.
1,Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase,"As a Scooby lover I had been looking forward to this game for some time. But it was with disappointment that I first played it. First of all, I thought that writing down passwords would be long gone now with the new GBA games. Not with Scooby! The graphics are not very good either. And the adventure was really, really short. With only 7 levels I was done in just a couple of hours. I thought I was getting ""a full game"" like Rayman or Pinobee or any other like those, that takes some time to finish. No, the game developer have definitely given Scooby and the gang a bad name. Don't buy this one unless it's for a 3 year old!"
4,Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase Rules!,"I think Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase is an entertaining Game Boy Advance Game. I gave it only 4 stars because some of the directions inside the box were unclear. It is non-violent and a good pasime. The levels do not get boring, and they are very close to the movie. Each level represents one or more of the mysteries Scooby Doo, Freddy, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy have or are solved or solving. I actually would rate it a 4.5 star, but that isn't an option."
3,"doesn't save progress, is old school in a way, and kind of short","we're used to mario, yoshi games that kind of automatically save as you beat levels. This game does not have that, instead you need passwords to unlock levels, and my 9 year old had trouble with that, even after entering in the passwords could not unlock levels so we just googled the passwords to unlock the other levels. Also when you shut off the game everything pretty much deletes so you have to reenter passwords every time you turn the game back on, which are 8 letters long, not easy to remember. for the cheap bargain price it's okay but it isn't as smooth as the gamecube scooby games, but we use gameboy for the car rides and it's a nice addition if you get it cheap but the password thing is annoying old tech."
2,Not such a good game,Scooby-doo isn't one of the better games for GBA... It has little action and I think it's too hard. It only kept me entertained for 30 mins or so...
1,this game is a waste,"This game is very boring. The levels are way to easy and they go on for ever. All you do in this game is walk around and collect scooby snacks. There is no challenge to this game at all, not even for a 4 year old. I beat the game in 2 hours."
1,Boo! Scooby Doo,"I am 20 yrs old and I've been a Scooby fan since I can remember and I hate to say it but this game just bites....It's not very challenging to start with and the characters can't really do much besides walk, run and jump. The point of each level is to get Scooby snacks and well, it's boring. Thumbs down for this one."
4,Hilarious!!!!,"This toy is hilarious!! Everytime I play with it it cracks me up. I bought it for a spanish friend who lives in Honduras(4 years old). The entire family loved it. I'm 48 years old. I also bought the english version for myself because I was so impressed. I show if off so much, my wife gets upset with me."
3,With multiple fold-outs,"This second volume in the series on the timber trees of the Guyana Shield is the most book for the money (at the publisher in the Netherlands it costs the same as the other volumes). Still it looks a little out of date, offering only small B&W pictures of end grain and an ID-program on diskette."
1,The Secret Life of Leonardo DaVinci,I was pretty disappointed in this DVD. I expected more fact and less drama.
2,Not Enough,I wish the video would have spent more time on the health aspects of a vegan diet and less on the environment and animal issues.
4,Filled in gaps and made me hungry!,"Filled in some gaps from other films in same genre. Weaves in clips of vegan restaurant chefs preparing delectable entrees and people in their homes making easy vegan dishes. Clearly notes basic truths such as that animal products encourage or allow cancer growth and clog arteries, whereas fruits and veggies stop and reverse these problems. Love the ""selling pencils"" quote."
5,Jazz Musicians In Turn Of The Century New Orleans Pay With Their Lives For Sexual Romp,"Another extraordinary tale from the author about early 1900's New Orleans life. The reader is taken back in time with vivid scenes of life in Storyville. All of a sudden jazz players from one five piece band start being murdered. The death toll increases as the rooming house landylady where one of the musicians had lived is also done away with. Then, the beautiful mistress of one of the victims, who had sought refuge with Creole Private Investigator Valentic St. Cyr, is killed. Madams of sporting houses that have paid off police are further extorted by someone. The beautiful former octoroon concubine of St. Cyr is threatened with the exposure of a deep dark secret from her past. St. Cyr's nemesis police lieutenant J. Picot plays a surprising role as he attempts to stifle St. Cyr's investigation. Top notch page turner."
2,"I really, REALLY tried","I was so excited to find this series after having a PASSIONATE love affair with the Benjamin January series (I couldn't read another book in between the series; I felt as if I would be cheating on Ben!). I got through the 1st in this series hoping it would get better with each one but as I struggle through the 2nd one, I have to admit defeat. It seems like the main character just sleeps, beats himself up, visits the King of Storyville, laments on the loss of his girlfriend and, oh, inquires about some dead people...and starts the process all over again the next day."
5,Customers Rule,"Nothing is more important to growing a company than turning customers into outspoken fans. This book is a great study into that kind of corporate motivation and the resulting top line growth.If you are a marketer, you have to understand Millet's point of view because of the ROI his strategy rewards. As a CEO, it is the kind of mantra that breeds total organizational success."
1,Preachy and condescending,"I read this book eagerly thinking it would give me great tips on doing home school in an easier manner. It does do that, but the writer's style is extremely off-putting. Though I am a Christian, I could not stand the implications that if one let their children read anything other than the KJV of the Bible or let their children watch TV, they were not being good parents or good Christians. Too much for me to wade through to get to the good stuff."
1,Not what I thought...,"Because of the title-Easy Homeschooling Technique""s"" I thought the book would be about different homeschooling technique""s"". It's not. It's about 1 technique. Very disapointing if you are already relatively happy with what you are doing and just looking for some fresh ideas."
1,"Way short, and antiquated remastering","This collection is one of those ""budget discs"" and only has 10 tracks, weighing in at less than 30 minutes. It is also quite old, and the remastering has been greatly improved since this CD came out. Look for one of the many newer collections that have far more tracks, sound much better, and are just as cheap. Just make sure it is made by Decca/MCA and not a bootleg import company."
3,just as the stars say its okay,Shipping was great got here days after ordering even tho it said it would take much longer. The color of the gravel however is not as shown. It is much lighter and nothing special. petco's is the same orange and costs a couple bucks less. if bought in stores a lot less. Dont waste your money unless the only thing you are worried about is a quick delivery.
3,short movies were weak in gay love making.,I thought these four vignettes were weak when it came to intimate gay sex. It could of been improved. I would not recommend purchasing this product. The stories were somewhat interesting. That is the best thing I can say about this four part video production. And the red headed boy looked nice. In all the production was generally weak.
2,Boys Life 5,"Just like boys Briefs 1-5. I do not find these worth the time or effort I put into buying them. There is no Sex of any kind, with the short films there really is nothing worth the time. I want kissing and some kind of sex act some where in some of these films."
4,what i think,"i like this game very much i gave it to my friend for another 2 games and benn looking all over for it. but when i had it i played it every chance i get i give this game four and a half stars. nintendo power gave it five when it came out, now i only have the first one. i am geting game cube for christmas so i will have the whole collection but i have x box but graphics better on game cube"
4,"its a great game, but kinda bad in the sound department","i have basically played every version of tony hawk 2 and theyre all fun. this versions no different. it has all the elements that make the other ones fun and great. the only problem with this version is that theres only 6 songs out of all of them that were on the psx or dreamcast version. theyre all the songs that i hated, like the chuck d one and dub pistols. theyre also edited, limiting only some instruments and the chorus. that really blows. other than that tho, this game is terrific. but only buy it if youre ready to listen to your own music. i turn the music off and listen to some alien ant farm and blink 182."
4,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2,"I thought that the game over all is a very well made game. The only reason that I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because sometimes the game will ""freeze"" when I wipeout and my guy/girl just keeps going around in a circle sliding around on the ground and it sometimes does this when i don't even wipeout. Like if i get too close to the fence and then it starts up again. And after it does that you need to tune the game of and restart it. Other than that the game is a very changeling and fun game to play."
5,This games is SICK!,I actualy do not even own this game. I rented it from Blockbuster and only have it for 5 days. Rest assured I will be buying it sooner than later. I always reccomend renting games first and I am so glad that I did rent this one. This truly is one of the best games ever! I highly reccomend this to everyone! Skate on brother's!
5,Terrific photos and information on all the cast,"This is an excellent book which not only features information on Peta Wilson but the rest of the talented cast as well. Roy Dupuis as Michael is in my opinion the real star of La Femme Nikita and this book contained some terrific photos of Mr. Dupuis that I had not seen before. You will also find information on Alberta Watson, Eugene Robert Glazer and the rest of the cast. The episode descriptions were excellent and I found myself shaking my head in agreement with every one of them. Great job, there is something here for everyone."
3,More of an episode guide than a biography,"If you were really, really interested in some deep background of Peta Wilson, this book only gives you a chapter or so. It's mostly an episode guide that is more thorough and up to date than La Femme Nikita Xposed. The editor probably could have touched up a few of the photos that weren't taken by a professional. But all in all, it was nice to see some time spent on USA's best television show."
1,more La Femme Nikita.............less Peta Wilson,"The title of this book is deceiving. It suggests that it is a biography of Peta Wilson, when only the first chapter is about Peta and the rest is about the show, the cast of La Femme Nikita and a chronology of each episode. It is not what I hoped it to be and wouldn't recommend to a reader looking for a biography of Peta Wilson because this book falls way short of that expectation. I wanted the biography and didn't get what I paid for................"
4,Great little book about the tv-series La Femme Nikita,I purchased this as a small companion to the soundtrack CD. Nice book that is well written. It contains some good pictures but to few in my opinion. A worthy buy if you like the tv-show.
5,League of their own/sleepless in seattle,"The DVD was reasonably priced, arrived promptly, was as described in listing, packaged well. Good vendor. I would use this vendor again."
5,Unbelievably humorous!,"The storyline is hilarious- Ms Longmore's adventures from Jamaica to Trinidad reveal to all, the true culture and tradition in the Caribbean. She portrays a vivid collage of colurful scenes that form the heritage and day to day life in the islands. It is a wonderful book to relive or to enter the magnificence under a warm tropical sun."
2,Didn't work as advertised,"i bought it to help me get my printer and 3 PCs networked with a linksys router. the application crashed several times and the UI was really hard to navigate. it ended up taking up time, rather than saving it."
2,Learning How to Learn,"As an educator and Ph.D. memory researcher I was disappointed in the narrow focus of the book. I rated this two stars only because the techniques work, in a very narrow and limited sense and the reader has a huge amount of time. If you're merely looking to memorize a lot of information, data and not make application of it, then this is the book for you. However, if you, your students or children need to THINK, problem solve, and analyze, you will obtain only a very limited set of skills with this book. Teaching usable learning skills is far more broad and complex than this book represents, which seems to lean rather heavily at times on being a sales pitch for Lucas. I found the techniques old and not the break-throughs that were hyped."
3,Toes of each stocking is solid but that's not in the description or image...,These are good unfinished tops fishnet stockings. I like the look with the garters and they are so comfy!Unfortunately the toes on each stocking are solid. That's not how they are described or how they are pictured on the packaging. So I can't wear open-toed shoes like I want to with them. BooooooooI just wish they'd said it in the description and I think it's wrong to have a different image on the packaging than what the actual product is.
3,I returned it because it was too large.,"Don't get me wrong - it is an absolutely gorgeous wallet, the leather feels like a baby's behind, and it has space to store everything you could possibly need for traveling. Well, not your clothes, but really, you might get a couple pairs of pants in it if you tried.My problem is that it was just TOO big. Getting it out and opening it would be like getting out a laptop case and opening. If you don't mind that, or if you plan to store things you need often like money somewhere else, then it might work. I ended up going with this instead, which is much smaller and more easily maneuvered: http://www.amazon.com/RFID-Blocking-Executive-Organizer-Passport/dp/B004GT9JOO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1359682176&sr;=8-1&keywords;=passport+wallet"
3,Cristian's merengue rendition was nice,"I purchased this CD to add more Merengue to my collection of dance music. I thought the best track was Azul by Cristian. Eddy Herrera and Miguel Angel also had some nice songs. The other tracks might be popular at the clubs, but I find their vocals and overall melodies marginal."
5,ERREWAY,"I have not much to say,except they are the best ;-)I love the songs in bouth albums.They are very realistic and full with honest feelings,they just know how to touch your heart.kiss*"
1,Dont bother ordering this book!,I returned this book because the print quality was awful. You would need a magnifying glass to read it. The shipment from Amazon was great it arrived on time.
1,"If you watch this, you too will have Sleepy Eyes",". If you're expecting a dark, antihero samurai drama like the premise suggests, you will be sorely disappointed. Although the basic plot is potentially interesting, the dialogue is contrived, the acting is extremely overdone, the sets are amateuristic, and the action sequences are slow and stagey. It's like a bad TV episode. I am a big fan of the genre, but I could not sit through this film in its entirety."
5,"Very useful, light weight & compact",One of the baby items I use almost everyday. I tried other brands but this was the lightest & compact since it folds twice.MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS PUT THE SECURE BELT ON so the car seat doesn't fall. My husband dropped our daughter in a car seat while he was playing with her without the belt. She didn't get hurt. Thank god that she was wearing the belt on the car seat. It really scared me though. Great product. Use with caution!
5,This is the best baby purchase out there!,"We bought the Maclaren Easy Traveller Stroller to use with our Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP car seat. This stroller frame is FANTASTIC! It turns on a dime, is lightweight, small and easy to toss into the trunk of any sedan. The basket is big and easy to access. The basket is big enough to hold a generous size diaper bag and one other shopping bag. The foam handles are a nice touch also. We love this stroller. It is much better to use than attaching the car seat to the giant Peg Perego P3 stroller that we also bought. I highly recommend this product. While it is expensive, it is much nicer quality than the less expensive Kolcraft competitor."
4,good stroller,"This stroller works great with my Chicco Keyfit car seat. The two things I don't like about it are the directions that Mclarens have a bad, they are not detailed and don't even have words, just bad pictures. It is also kinda complicated to fold and unfold. Maybe not complicated, just hard to remember and not very easy to do. The basket is really big and you can still get inside it from the front when the car seat is on it. The stroller is really easy to push, even with one hand, very smooth too! Was wonderful in the airport and is great for taking in and out of the trunk since it is so much lighter than travel system stroller. Worth it!"
1,Doesn't fit Peg Perego Primo Viaggio!,This is a great idea but it does NOT 'fit' the Peg Perego Primo Viaggio as advertised. Unless you are happy with your carseat just sitting in the stroller that is! I paid a lot of money for a carseat with side impact protection so having it just rest on there was not for me. There is a cheesy belt that comes with to 'secure' it. If the carseat had clipped in like it does on the Pliko P3 I would have have been happy to keep it.
4,Great for Graco car seats,"I started off using a Peg Perego car seat but found that it didn't work well with the Maclaren (not to mention that the car seat itself was heavy and difficult to use). It was much easier putting my baby into the Graco car seat (she also fussed a lot less in it) and the Graco snapped into the Maclaren Easy Traveler very well. The cargo space in the bottom was ample and great for groceries, etc."
4,Like it!!,"The Easy Traveller is great. The only downside is that there isn't a compartment for your drinks or keys, etc. It does come with a detachable bottle holder. The basket is nice and large. Very lightweight to easily put in and out of car."
5,"Lightweight, maneuverable and very compact!","This stroller delivers on its promises of being lightweight and very compact and has been a lifesaver since it is light enough to be gate checked with our car seat at the airport. My only recommendation, which is very minor, is that Maclaren make the bottle holder larger and more sturdy. Any bottle I have put in the holder has fallen when going over a bump (the snap and go's have very sturdy holders). Other than that, this stroller is perfect for us."
2,Not for the Britax Companion,"We were thrilled that Maclaren came out with an infant car seat stroller frame...especially since it is marketed to accomodate the Britax Companion. To our dismay, the Easy Traveler does NOT safely hold the Companion and the stroller we received is actually defective. My husband is active duty military & we live in Japan, so we depend on online shopping. Because the shipping time is so long we are outside of our 30 day return time...so now we have to deal directly with Maclaren. Well, actually an authorized repair company for Maclaren. Not sure where we'll find one in JAPAN! The stroller is over priced and it's a hassel to deal with this company. We are crossing our fingers that nothing goes wrong with our Techno XT."
1,This store is drastically overcharging for the Easy Traveller.,"It should cost $70, and is available elsewhere online for the list price. Price gouging is uncool."
2,nice try,The intro on this cd is AWESOME the only thing that is BAD is the music nothing really new the songs in the cd are very oldthis would have been really good 18 months ago. now I also have ultramix vol. 2 and that one was good because the music was newand the mixes were alos good. In other words the songs on this cdreally s[tink] it has nothing really popular.
3,Not so many bubbles,"We had purchased this bubble bath a few times for our 16 month old son who loves bubbles. We love that they come with a bubble wand so you can blow bubble while he baths in bubbles. However, the two bottles we received from our most recent order didn't work. No bubbles. You could get bubbles if the bubble bath was poured in to the water but no bubbles with the bubble wand. So, that was a disappointment.On another note, our son had a fever for a few days and saw a pediatrician who said she really discourages parents from using bubbles at all in their child's bath. Even ""all natural"" bubbles like this. They can cause or be a contributer to UTI's in little ones. She was concerned that may have been what was going on with him. In the end, it was just a virus and not a UTI but as a result of our meeting with her, we won't be using bubbles in his bath any more. :("
1,"For the price, you should get more than water, right?!","Like the previous reviewer, I too noticed a difference in the consistency of the bubbles. So I contacted California Baby via email, and heard a response right away from someone named ""Sue"" who promised that she would send me a postage paid envelope for me to return the defective bottles I had. Problem is, she didn't follow through, and has not to this day. So after a month of my twins crying for bubbles, I moved on to another product. I feel like I got gipped! My advice...the customer service department at CA Baby doesn't care if you are happy with their product...so move on unless you want to pay $9 a bottle for water!"
3,Peaks & valleys.....,"I bought this album off the strength of ""Barely Breathing"" and ""She Runs Away"", and was neither surprised nor disappointed after giving it a listen. There is a sad and dark theme throughout, although at times Sheik struggles to maintain it. The album starts off strong with the hits mentioned above, begins to trails off (thanks to some uninspired lyrics and a somewhat redundant sound that starts wearing thin), and then returns to full strength at the end. ""The End of Outside"" is slightly more up-tempo song featuring a catchy hook, and ""Little Hands"" is a darker, acoustic song that helps end the record on a positive yet sinister note. Fans of Sheik's radio hits should feel right at home with this one, although don't be surprised if you find yourself reaching for the Forward button during the middle tracks."
5,Soulful Singer Indeed!,"I learned about Duncan Sheik like most people did, ""Barely Breathing"". When I got the album I was expecting ""pop"" songs like you would hear on the radio. Instead, I got beautifully crafted, well-sang songs. Duncan is truly ahead of his time. He is a brillant songwriter and definately unappreciated among ""the masses"". I am a dedicated fan and look forward to hearing more of his work (and seeing him live). ""Days Go By"" is my favorite so far."
2,...is this what music has come to...?,"Maybe it's just me...but this record really just isn't any good. Duncan Sheik CAN sing--I'll give him that--but as far as a songwriter he, well, he isn't. He would do much better to have someone write songs for him. Some one like Diane Warren or Gretchen Peters. If he could get some good material, then he just might be a big star. Still, I do like his voice. Very smooth. And coupled with a pretty face, he just might be big someday, if, like I said, he could get someone to write songs for him. Can anyone say TEEN IDOL? Sure, I knew that you could...."
3,Solid effort- could have been better,"Mixed reviews on this one. Duncan definitely has talent. His vocals and arrangements shine on tracks like Reasons For Living and especially Out of Order (by far the best song on this CD). On the other hand, many of the songs are so soft and overdone with strings that they seem to run together. A violin here and there can really add some power, but this is the full blown orchestra and it shows up in at least half the tracks. As for the lyrics, some had me choked up and others had me holding my head in embarrassment. How the same person can write something so deep like ""Even my wonder / even my fears / only amount to a couple of tears"" and the cliche-ish ""When I'm without you the day turns into night"" is beyond me. Overall, though, this makes good background or mood music, with the occasional track that you can turn up loud and fully soak in. Don't pay more than 10 bucks for it."
2,Boring,"The first 3 songs are good and keep your interests up, but the rest of the songs are slow and I had a hard time not falling asleep. Hopefully Duncan will realize that the upbeat songs that got airplay is his best style."
1,Not a fan,Sorry to say but I just don't see what's so great about good ol' Duncan. I personally think that he sounds whiny and mechanical (at least in Barely Breathing). It's bland.
1,one star is too good for this CD,I bought this in a thrift store for 99 cents and I should get 98 cents back.. this plain puts me to sleep. barely Breating is the only good song.
2,II only wish the whole CD was as good as the 1st 3 songs!,"I bought the CD after hearing ""Barely Breathing"". I couldn't believe how wonderful it was during the first three songs and was making a mental note of the number of CDs that I was going to buy to give to friends to share his great work. Then..... the rest of the CD played. It put me to sleep and I was emarrassed that I was going to buy this to hand out to people. I am very hopeful but hesistant about ""Humming."" And I thought I had found my replaement for Toad the Wet Sprocket. I hope the next CD has a lot more spunk."
3,Smells like 1995,"One of my earliest forays into ""sad bastard sleepy time tea music"". Ol Duncan Here has a face that won't quit and a voice that sounds like sad velvety butter. I love this album but as a woman I relisten and can hear it's faults much like I look back on my 1995 self and see her faults too. Duncan will always have a place in my heart."
3,This is a great and creative CD!,"Ducan Sheik is one of my favorite entertainers because his songs have a lot of meaning. He is a very talented man. Not only does he have a great voice, but his lyrics reach out and touch you. They get your attention! My favorite song by him is ""Barely Breathing"". This is a song about loving someone so much that you would do anything for them, and you know that they don't love you back. You know that they are just using you. But because you love them, you're willing to stand by them and get hurt again just because you are a better person! The rest of his CD was okay. There were some good songs, it however wasn't the greatest thing. But the song ""Barely Breathing"" makes the whole CD absolutely fantastic!"
1,HOW DARE YOU MR. MADSEN!,"This book is an insult to Barbara Stanwyck's memory. It is full of untruths, imaginings, and unsubstantiated fantasy. Mr. Axel Madsen is very Lucky Barbara is not here to sue the pants off him.The best thing I can say about this book is that it has some nice photos but one can find these elsewhere. Don't waste time on this garbage.If you want to read a good biography of Barbara Stanwyck read: Barbara Stanwyck A Biography Author: Al DiOrio ISBN 0-698-11247-4 copyright: 1983"
3,"Generic bio, made interesting only by its subject matter","Poor Barbara Stanwyck! She made the unpardonable error of living a relatively scandal-free life in Hollywood. If what Madsen says about her sexuality is true, he fails to back it up with any substantiative evidence; Stanwyck made few enemies during her reign in Hollywood; with the exception of Maureen O'Sullivan, and who was she? Whatever she did, she was discreet, unlike her contemporaries Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Her personal life was her personal life, and while many of us would give our left arm to really know the more intimate details of her personal life, you have to respect her for keeping a hermetically sealed lid on it.Also, Madsen does not use enough photographs in this book, it would have been nice to see more."
1,Doesn't Even Deserve One Star,"This man seems so intent to defame Stanwyck's name is subtle, deragatory ways. His sources are unbelievable.....the tabloids?????? Come on, that should say something right there about his credibility as an author.Stanwyck was a legend and had to much class to be relegated to garbage like this from someone who obviously felt like he had to make some money off a great film star's life but failed to research his subject adequately and got most of his information from other biographies already published about her and of course...the tabloids...""The National Enquirer"", ""The Star"" and ""The Globe"".Mr. Madsen ought to be ashamed of himself for taking a great subject and making a book about her life mediocre. If Stanwyck were alive she'd slap his face and spit on it too!"
3,not that good nfl2k1 isbetter,I recently rented NCAA football and I wanted it for Christmas but its not all that good the commentary is the same as nfl 2k1the celebrations in the n-zone its basically the same its hard to tackle.My favorite play is the Triple Option Fake.Im just saying dont go out and buy it unless u really like College Football. Plus (this) is to much money for this game
3,It's Alright,"Well I bought this game a long time ago it is pretty cool you have all these college teams to pick from of course I like the greatness of Univ. of So. Cal ..... who wouldn't. Well anyways back to the game I really enjoyed this football game as I do all pretty much... and yes when you put this game on a all-pro level your recievers drop more of the passes and almost impossible to run but thats not what disappoints me what disappoints me is what ever happen to the hard hitting in these games. Football is a collision sport. I guess what I am saying what ever happen to the Madden style football, the put your head down and smack the Rb or blind side the QB, Now thats football. I hate this wrap and tackle .. I mean it is cool to tackle but every once in a while I want to square up with the RB or the reviever and unleash the power of HIT MADDEN STYLE."
3,A Disappointment Overall,"After much anticipation, there is finally a college football game for the Dreamcast. Unfortunately, NCAA 2K2 doesn't quite bring it all together although it's not a terrible game. As mentioned in some other reviews, there are the little things. Only a smattering of fight songs available and several of those are for less than ""major"" college football powerhouses. That might not be so bad if the game wouldn't play those songs for schools to which they don't belong. Hearing ""Boomer Sooner"" crank up when you're not playing with or against OU is a little strange. Graphically, the game passes muster but there's nothing that seems extraordinary. This game has the look and feel of something that was in progress when the Dreamcast plug was pulled and never had the finishing touches put on. I've held off on joining the PS2 masses, but it may be time."
4,Computer the mighty impossible.,I like this game. It's good overall. The computer settings are to different. The 1st setting is easy. 2nd Hard and I haven't even touched the 3rd one yet. Overall I still say it's a good buy. I mean any game college is good becqause they're few and far between.
3,Good graphics but lacks longevity,"This is a great game at the beginning with some killer graphics, but it lacks the gameplay in legacy mode that nfl 2k2 has, like trades and the NFL Draft. The recruiting mode totally sucks it's impossible to get good players. So if you have a lot of games and you just want to play this one every now and then with some multiplayer action then this game's for you. But if not you will probably lose interest soon as i have after 2 weeks."
1,Too little too late,"I find it hard to believe there are those who rave about the graphics of NCAA 2K2. From the screen shots that I have seen from various websites, the graphics seem to be a far stretch from those offered up by NCAA 2002 on Ps2. The characters seem messy and the uniforms seem very simple. Also, with NCAA 2002, you get the Heisman Trophy, all of the bowl games, the BCS, the AP and Coaches polls, mascots, fight songs, chants, and the ESPN crew (although I would like to see Chris Fowler integrated into the game, maybe a halftime roundup from around the nation)."
4,Longhorns,"this is one of the best ive ever played but the problem is that its too easy. even when you put it too all american its still pretty easy. the neat things about the game is how real the football fields look, like i sometimes go to the Kansas JayHawks football games and their feild is pretty neat but on this game the field looks a whole lot a like the one in real life.i say buy this game buty to wait for NFL 2K2."
4,"A good game,only if you really like College Football","I got this game for my birthday and I was really excited because its the first College Football game for Dreamcast.The Graphics are great and the commentary is pretty good.Here are the problems......There are only a few fight songs,for example if you are playing with Clemson and score a touchdown,the Notre Dame Fighting Irish song will play.Weird.Also,if you play Starter level,you receivers will only catch the ball 1 out of every 25 passes and 90% of the passes are intercepted.To sum it all up,this is a descent game,but it will never be a great game."
3,"Good, but not original","Although this is a good game, it's just not that original. The player models and fields look great. I even like the band music that they threw in there, although it gets repetitive. Everything else about it is exactly like NFL2K1. The passing style, the running moves, the defense, and even the commentary is the same(they just changed a few words). It's every bit like playing 2K1. The playbooks are different, which is a plus, but it's hardly enough to make you feel like your are playing a new game. I hope NFL2K2 does a better job."
4,First and not a bad job,alright listen. For this being the fist ever ncaa game for dreamcaset I think it's safe to say that this gme is a hit. So it might not compare to a PS2 game. But this is dreamcast. And we waited a long time to get our NCAA FOOTBALL!
1,I hate this game,"I waited and waited for this game and when I finally gpt it I was very dissapointed. I would have given this game a 0 out of 5 stars, but I couldn't do that. Take my advice if you want a good football game, just wait for NFL 2K2 to come out.Peace out,Adam S."
2,Cliche,Probably could work for novice readers on this category. Too verbose for this and next generation. If you have hit the plateau on your spiritual learning - forget this book.
4,its great,Great item. It is as described on the site. Shipping was fast and price was great. I wouldn't mind recommend this to some friends. Keep up the great job. Thanks.
3,Good to Know,This book was filled with information I already knew about how to live a sucessful life. The hard part of that equation is living it and it is too bad that a lot of it will take up the rest of your life.
4,Girlschool - 'Race With The Devil Live' (Receiver) 4 1/2 stars,"Not sure as to when this total *ss-kicking sixteen track vintage Girlschool show took place, but nonetheless, this CD rocks! Couldn't get enough of the sizzlers like ""C'mon Let's Go"", ""Hunter"", my personal all-time Girlschool favorite the awesome ""Race With The Devil"", ""Don't Call It Love"", the rocking ""Don't Stop"", ""Future Flash"", ""Hit&Run"" and the rousing cover of ZZ Top's ""Tush"". Sound quality is great! Recommended. Another worthy live Girlschool release is their 'King Biscuit' disc (see my review)."
5,Super!,"This is a particularly fiery show from Girlschool and features some standout tracks.From the opening blast of C'mon Lets Go the band sounds great and never lets up,the crowd is really into it (i think the show was recorded in Japan 1982?) and the atmosphere is intense.I'm really glad i picked this up -first rate heavy rock."
5,Great Book,This book needs to be read. The stories of our brothers and sisters in Guatemala are powerful and remind us we are all one.
3,ok for what there is,"There isn't much on either side of the tape.And he speaks too quickly for you to mentally repeat what he says.And at the end there is a wake up command that I disliked until I learned to stop the tape just before it & use it in the morning.I personally didn't like his directions to go to the beach to feel the sun, or take a shower to feel energy.But I'm listening to it until I can find a better one."
1,Could have been better,"After seeing the XBOX preview movie for Silent Hill 2, it's apparent how lacking the PS2 version is in the graphics department. If you are picking up an XBOX, you'd be much smarter to wait for the XBOX version. Otherwise, a worthwhile PS2 game."
4,This game is Scary!!,Started playing last night the graphics are great and the Sound is awesome. Playing by yourself in a dark room is great. This one is going to be a classic.
2,A BIG let down!,"I could not wait to get this game and started playing it as soon as it arrived. I thought I was going to love it since it involved puzzles and had a horror story quality. I was so disappointed. The story line had so much potential. The character was hard to control and the game was set up so that it dictated you're movement. It took me quite awhile to actually get into the game. Finally it stated to get really interesting then it ended only to leave me very angry. I was very upset with the ending!! I have heard that you can get different endings under different settings, but the idea of having to sit through all that again does not interest me at all! I would reccomend renting this game, NOT buying it."
3,Scary But Confusing,"I played the first game, if you expect Silent Hill 2 to be very similar, think again. First of all let me tell you what is wrong with this game. There is no introduction to the characters, who cares if your hero lives or dies? Why care if his dead wife is really alive? The enemies are repetitive and easy to kill. The story really does not make sense and the voice acting suffers from poor writing. TOO much FOG!Now let me tell you about all the good things about this game. Silent Hill 2 will entertain you. The graphics and sound together will send chills up your spine. There is replay value because of multiple endings and addtional weapons. Play this game with the lights off and the surround sound on. It IS worth your money if you can handle the puzzles and item fetching. Try it."
1,terrible,"i played and finished silent hill, even though it was a painfully bad game. but i heard a lot of buzz for this and figured that konami might have gotten this one right...well, too bad for me. thank god for e-bay because at least i was able to unload this pile of dung. don't waste your time. play resident evil instead."
5,"""AAHHHHHHHH!!""","I used to think the Resident Evil games were scary! That is, until I played this nasty little gem for PS2. Holy crap! I literally had nightmares about this stuff. Very Lovecraftian. The dank atmosphere is brilliant, and the foggy unseen images are brutal. Definitely NOT for the squeemish.In my opinion, the best of the 3 Silent Hill games."
5,I hate to sound cliche.....,"but, this game is dripping with atmosphere. I like all kinds of games, but lately I've been more drawn to eploration types of games. Both Silent Hill games deliver on on exploration, puzzles, and best of all, they create a mood matched by very few games. The look of Silent Hill 2's graphics is stunning. At first I didn't like the grainy texture of the game, but the more I got into the game, I was able to appreciate that look, as it added to the realism of the gritty feel of the game. There are quite a few good games out there that do a good job of creating a mood, but the graphics, sound effects, and story of Silent Hill 2 go to another level. When a game can take a player to different emotional states, it has accomplished something, and Silent Hill 2 does this excellently.If you like a game that has great atmosphere, and just plain feels creepy, and you like exploration and problem solving, don't miss Silent Hill 2. It's a great experience."
4,Great price,"Our son was so happy. Silent hill fan and the new games are not cheap. Looked great, played great. Thanks."
3,Gruesome to the max,"Silent Hill does develop an interesting story but it is spooky and gruesome to the max. Dispatching the living dead is a bloody mess and could give a person nightmares for a week. There was no excuse for the slow movement of the main character and difficulty in guiding him. The puzzles are challenging but the search for items in dark, decaying hotel mazes tried my patience in the end. I wouldn't attempt this game without a strategy guide."
3,Good graphics/scenery but too many scenes make no sense,"I agree the ambience is eerie but that the fog is so thick it becomes very annoying. My main complaint is the scenes that leave me saying ""what the (...) was that all about?"" Like when you are being chased my 2 ""metalheads,"" and after ricocheting bullets off their masks for three years, they all of a sudden stick their own spears in their throats and continue standing even though they are dead. In order to get through the door after this, you take eggs out of their hands, yes EGGS, and stick them in the door. (spoiler) At the end it says ""Some mysteries have been solved and some remain..."" I'm not waiting for all mysteries to be solved, but maybe these scenes could be reconfigured to make more sense than an LSD trip."
5,Will it deliver...?,"Just happened to read the ""review"" from somebody that supposedly has played Silent Hill 2. Pretty odd considering the game was just released here in Japan. Maybe this person was mistaken, and he thought the first game was the latest... I wonder... Anyway, Silent Hill 2 is a big buzzword here in Tokyo, with many people lining up to hopefully get a good fright from this promising game. The previews and demonstration gameplay sure shows some of the weirder elements of the game (some of it is pretty grotesque), but hopefully it lives up to the hype and provides some challenging puzzles as well as the straight spooky stuff that is hard to find in a video game these days. From what I have seen and heard so far, it looks like it could very well be a winner. Will it deliver...? I surely hope so."
2,The Typical Game,"Being a sequal to one of the best games I have ever played, Silent Hill 2 came short in many areas. First off the plot was rather dull and I was never really scared that much. If you liked the first one then I would NOT rent or buy the second. To be on the good side, the graphics were amazing. But then the voice acting was horrible. So, I guess it depends on what you like."
2,Interestingly Boring,"I'm new to Playstation and have been spending alot of time reviewing and trying out new games to try and find my niche'. This game is definitely not it! The graphics are grainy. The character's movements are awkward. There are lots of eerie noises but u don't see anything, at least not in the begining - I couldn't get past a hour or so to find out more. The inventory screen is terrible to use. The map is useful but all I did was spend time trying to find my way around town. Perhaps it gets better, but like any good book, if it don't get me by the end of the first page, I'm done. I was very quickly done with this game. So far I like Tombraider 4 and the Devil May Cry. I also hated Resident Evil, which I will review in that section."
2,Resident evil is just a plain better game in this Genre,"While Silent Hill 2 becomes bearable once the plot starts to move (you spend about 20 minutes walking around with no interactions at the beginning of the game) it just doesn't measure up in graphics, story, monsters, puzzles, or scare factor that resident evil has. Resident evil makes you jump out of your seat practically from the start. Silent hill has you yawning as your character follows a path for about 10 minutes to the first save point. The game play here is a little easier to master than RE, however. Younger players may have a shorter learning curve on silent hill than on resident evil. If you're not already an avid fan of this genre, rent it first. If you can't have enough of the horror/thriller type games than go ahead and get it though you may be underwhelmed and waiting to jump out of your seats in vain."
3,Could have been so better,This game had so many good qualities. But it had a lot of bad qualities too that is the problem. The First Game on the first playstation was a lot better.
3,"Average game,not a game to go out and buy",The way the charator moves does not have a good feel to it.It does not play like the Max Payne game.
5,One Of The Best Games,"Silent Hill 2 Is one of the best games i've ever played, its also one of the scariest games i've played, its seriosly does scare you, its one of the games that makes you wanna play with the light on, the music and the envirement scares you, not to mention some of the monsters, the story line is great and so is the game, if you liked the first silent hill you'll definitly like this one."
4,pretty cool,"This game is great. I only gave it 4 for the story but it is srary. Graphic today make games so much better. The gore effects are awsome, and the weapons are standard to today other than a ultra-electro-frying-brain-gun. This game is a get for REAL gamers."
4,Wow my nerves are shattered,"Well to be perfectly honest I have been up all night playing on and off and my sense of reality is fleeting from me with each passing moment. Much like the first game, this one gets in your head and under your skin. The graphics are amazing, the sound is top notch, and the story and voice acting are perfect. The only problem I had was that if you played the first game a lot of this won't affect you as much having already been desensitized to it before (demon nurses in the hospital anyone?) But it is definitely a step up and not to be missed, they really took their time crafting this game to be perfect. The Resident Evil games to me were always like cheesy horror, enjoyable but highly silly and not at all scary. This game is the way it should be; leaving you in a state of paranoia and claustrophobia that continues even long after you've put down your controller. Don't miss it."
3,Waaaay too much Running!,"Good game by the folks at Konami. However, I did feel that many times, running from place to place became very excessive and boring. Nice psychological thriller. However, the fact that so many of these games are up for sale used demonstrates that most people don't care to play it through again to see the alternate endings."
2,Looks good/Plays bad,"A very good looking game with good backround music and sounds. Playing the game however means runnung all over, and not really getting any ware. The puzzels are complicated, and keep you from really enjoying the game. Rent it before you buy it."
2,not as creepy as the first,"Because I found the first Silent Hill one of the most frightening games that I had ever played, I sat in anticapation to see what the second had to offer, hell, I even wanted the game even BEFORE I got the Playstation 2 system. The first game frightened me, the second pretty much bored me. The first fifteen minutes or so of SH2 you find yourself running down some foggy path and, if you remembered the first game, wondering when are the creepy sound effects and eerie scenary going to take place. The creatures are frightening at first, but after fighting the same ones for at least an hour, they tend to get stupid. And where the first one followed the main character through what he percieved to be reality and a dark, nightmare world, this one doesn't. After an hour or so I stoppped playing, highly dissappointed and wishing that I had bought either Code Name: Veronica or Devil May Cry instead."
5,Damn!!! this game is off the chain.,"I mean damn this game is so tight, i have to get this game if i have to beg, borrow, or ... to get this game. I love scary games that make you want to play then all day and night because you get caught up in the supense. This game makes resident evil look like a childrens game."
2,Not very good!,"I was expecting and hoping this game would be alot better. The damn fog makes it so you cant see anything, its not scary because the game is so foggy you barely see anything, and its really hard to know where you are going so you need to look at your map every 10 seconds. The game would be alot better if there wasnt as much fog and if there was a more realistic story.Story: 2Graphics: 9Gameplay: 4Overall: 3"
3,"I won't lie,,, i like this game but!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","this game would have made a very interesting movie , as a game it can get boring, so i had to play it like two hours at at timethen rest the story made me curious i just had to play this for myself.It's a the kind of when you just want to open and close door fecth this fetch that and solve some aimless riddles this the game for you!!!!!!!!!!! did i mention the controls????????????? it's like trying to steer a lawn mower with a axe handle!!!!!!!! but if you want more i don't think this will satistfy your gaming needs i still love konami and this isn't so baaaaaad.i think it will have it's fans i am just not one of them laterzzzzzz........"
3,Decent game that's not silent enough.,"The voice acting is amazingly poor in this game. Don't the people who produce this garbage have any artistic sense beyond graphics and sound? It's embarrassing. I would never let a friend see me watching a dialogue sequence in this game because her or she would think I was a melodramatic simpleton.It's not very scary also, though I enjoyed the mood and textures. But there was way too much fog and poor lighting. I would like to see greater than fifteen feet for more than five percent of the time I'm playing.To it's credit there is a lot a replay value though the game is short overall.Rent this and turn the sound off when anyone tries to speak.""I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...why...why...why...why...James...James...James..."""
4,Its Okay!!,"I bought Silent Hill 2 a few weeks back and oh boy, was I impressed. The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is even better. But the only aspect of the game, which botherd me was the entire theme of the game. Its Physcologically terrifying, as it just broadens your horizon of fear. Well if youre in for a thrill that will scare the ""Hell"" out of you, GO GET IT!!Im 17 and honestly speaking, the game did send a shiver down my back. But you eventually loose the initial fear.Overall I would give Konami a Big Thumbs up!!!"
4,Almost perfect,"Great game that keeps you ready to jump right off your seat. Very scary and suspenseful, with great graphics, animations and story line.The only thing that would make it better would be to make this a first-person game; with the third-person perspective, it is sometimes hard to see where you're going. I think setting this in a first-person perspective would be even more frightening.Definitely worth a look!"
5,Smart....,This game is amazing! It's great on a big screen with surround sound and the lights off with a few people (make sure you exclude idiots) and it will be amazing fun! The idiot will make you think the game will suck and destory the mood of the horror he will make fun of it because he does not understand! So play it and have fun
4,GREAT PS2 TITLE but....,"This is one of the best (...) PS2's games I have played but, there are a couple things I don't understand, like how long after does Silent Hill 2 take place after the first one? Or does it take place before? and also aquiring all endings are extremly difficult and requires strict guidelines, one simple small mistake could lead you to an ending you have aquired already, it's a pain (...) and can get very frustrating after putting an X amount of hours into one gameplay mode just to get an ending you already seen, and not to mention the flashlight isn't as bright as it should be, this version seemed like James was carrying a cheap wax candle around, but overall the game was great, it's 50x scarier than it's predecesor, and bigger and badder monsters, and cut scenes were done and placed perfectly, anyway, hope this helps someone!"
3,"Scary, but way too short","This game has its scary/weird/intense moments, definitely, but it is so short that it is not worth the (dollar amount). With 10-12 hours of actual gameplay, it's better to rent it for three days and beat it for $5, trust me. I was also very disappointed by the puzzles - there were much too few, and some of them were so ridiculously easy (even on the ""hard"" setting) that they hardly even count. This is the sort of game you might want to get in order to show off your PS2 to your friends for a few minutes, but secretly inside you'll get that empty feeling that you should have bought yourself something else."
5,Hell yeah!!!!,"Wow! You asked for a great sequel? You got it! I definiet;y could put this game down until it was through. It was the kind of game you wish took weeks to finish. It had the same crazy camera angles and slow, clumsy character issues, but that's part of the game. So dark and morbid. You couldn't ask for a creepier game. Can't wait to get Silent Hill 3."
3,Not useful for studying for the 5195,"This book was published in 2005, and it describes the older, paper-format exams, and not the new Spanish: World Language (5195) exam.This book is the only study guide I have been able to find anywhere, which is why I bought it anyway. I don't think it is completely useless, but it's very close to being useless. The literature from ETS about the 5195 describes an exam that is very markedly different from the one described in this book. Not only has the format changed, but it appears that the focus of the content on the newer exam has shifted quite a bit, and that large sections of the material in this book are not relevant at all.If you buy this, just be aware of what you're getting."
3,eh,the only thing worthwhile about this book is the practice test and even that is pushing it. this is the kind of test where you either know the information or you don't. this study guide scared me even more rather than putting me at ease because it lists an infinite amount of topics that could be on the real test. the majority of what's inside can be found on the ets website. definitely buy it on amazon and not the ets website because its not worth the money they want to charge you.
3,Helps with knowing how test is set up,"I was studying for the Spanish Language Praxis in order to be able to teach K-12 Spanish. This book was helpful in that I was confident going into the test that I knew what to expect as far as the set up. I knew that I would have one minute during the speaking part to say what I needed to and that I would have a couple minutes to prepare my thoughts. That is what the book is good for is letting you know what to expect as far as set up. Otherwise, you either know how to speak, read, write, and understand Spanish or you don't and buying this book won't help you with that. Be aware that if you take the computer based version of this test you will only have 20 seconds to mark your answer, the book didn't prepare me for that and I missed a couple because the page disappeared before I had time to mark my answer and you can't go back."
5,a HUGE help!,"I'm preparing for my certification as a Spanish teacher, and this book is letting me know exactly what I need to focus on to insure success. It's a great guide in my studies !"
1,Study Guide for Spanish Content area exam,"I did not like this book. I studied all of the cultural perspetive sections (geography, lifestyle, sociolenguitic elements, history, arts and literature). None of it appear in the Georgia spanish exam. It was a waste of time and money. I did not like the format of the book either."
4,well functioning charger,"I no longer have the cell phone that uses this charger as it had a fatal accident. However, while the phone worked, the charger did an excellent job. It's compact and easy to store."
5,Works fine,"When you plug it into an AC socket, then plug it into a device, electricity flows into the device, thus charging it. Mission accomplished!"
3,Works but not an original Nokia Charger,"I bought this charger under the impression that it is the original nokia charger. I guess I did not read carefully. Anyhow, I am happy with this product. It works well with my 6630."
1,Does not work with NOKIA 6030,The charger does not work with Nokia 6030. Why one should buy such products when it is not even working with the model it claims to support.
1,Very bad product,"I've just recieved this charger for my nokia 7270. It didn't work and didn't charge my Nokia. At first, i thought that my Nokia's battery had been dead, but then i tried to use my cousin's Nokia charger, it worked regularly. Wasted about 4 USD for this product and don't want to return because of the shipping fees."
5,Better than original for my 6015i Nokia phone.,"This OEM has a much heavier duty cord and puts out 5.6volts at 800mh for a much faster charging rate than the original. As you may not know the Nokia 6015i phone was one of the first digital ""not smart"" phones with push button keys. I still have two for in-house calls only. No land line. Old but very reliable. I carry around a LG-GLANCE smart phone in a magnet snap-shut leather carry case."
1,too big,"Did not work with my phone, because my phone had a smaller plug and vendor did not show good pic or description"
1,Charger didn't work,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this product didn't work. When I plug it into my Nokia 1100b phone, the phone says 'not charging'. Even when plugged in for hours, the battery did not charge. Be warned it didn't work -- at least not for my older model Nokia 1100b."
4,Just what the doctor ordered,"I enjoyed reading ""A Magical Christmas"". During the pre-Christmas rush it was fun to read something timelyand light with a simple plot. Many would argue that it was too light and predictable; but when one is busy, running around getting ready for the holidays it was a great diversion from the craziness. It is a "" feel good"" story with anuncomplicated, relatable theme. I would recommend it highly!"
4,Well told fantasy with some depressing elements,"I am a fan of Heather Graham (aka Shannon Drake) and her many historical and other romances so I grabbed this one up along with a few other Christmas romances by her. Unlike her other romances, the Christmas ones are all ""G rated."" This one is a very well written Christmas romance with some heartwarming moments and a happy ending for at least one family, but it begins with a disaster that sees the end of an entire Civil War family and then we enter the lives of a contemporary family torn apart by betrayal and mistrust and continual arguments (for half the book)--and all that was rather depressing. The Civil War (now ghost) family helps the modern one torn apart by argument so that there is a happy ending (though it's rather bittersweet since the ghost family only gets together on Christmas Eve). I wouldn't read it again but if you have a family that needs to learn to appreciate each other, this could be the ticket."
5,Greatest Action Movie,"This movie has to be one of the greatest action packed vampire movies of all time. It can't even be compared to the other movies of the trilogy. It is just that much better. Wesley Snipes plays the character of Blade (half vampire, half man)and has all the strenghs of a vampire, but none of the weakness of a man. He uses his power trying to make the whole vampire race extinct. Ending it with the ultimate fight against the head vampire.This movie is a very voilent one at that, but has to be. It incorporate many different martial arts and special effects, which only adds to the action. This is a must see movie and establishes how action movies should be."
3,A great vampire movie,"This movie has two main themes: Gore and Vampires. Snipes plays Blade, a half human and half vampire person who is only that way because his mother was bitten during pregnancy. Since then he, out to look for the vampire that made him the freak he is, uses his vampiric abnormalities to kill any nosferatu he can find. It's packed with a bunch of scenes ranging from stakes to slices to vampire combustions. Then it comes to a blood filled ending where he finds that same vampire and his now vampiric mother; it all leads up to a freakish ending with a blood god and flying skeletons that really didn't make a whole lot of sense. But it made for a good fight scene. But if you're looking for a good, logical, well-written story to back up all this (what I normally prefer i.e. Gladiator) then you are looking in the wrong place. But if you like some tastefully and not-so-tastefully used gore and vampires, then this is definitely for you."
3,"OK, but not great","After two discs that would pixelate (is that a word?) from about 1:18 to 1:30, I finally got a third one and was able to watch the rest of the movie.Very gory, good effects, nice integration of technology and mythology.One and a quarter thumbs up."
4,The best comic book-related movie yet,"From the start Blade contains some of the most kinetic fight scenes ever filmed. What's even cooler is that the lone warrior is taking on hordes of blood-sucking vampires. With lots of high-tech weaponry and super-human martial arts, as well as a healthy dosage of blood and gore, Blade is great for action and horror fans alike.The DVD itself is amazing. The supplements it contains are astonishing. Blade is the reason DVD was created!"
4,Just when you thought the comic based movie was dead...,"Finally, a movie that compares with the original Batman. Fight scenes are well choreographed and the cinemetography is to die for. A definate recommendation for those looking for something new and different."
4,BLADE IS BRILLIANTLY CRAFTED!!!!!!!!!,"So its not perfect...But its damn close. I heard dozens of people say this movie sucks, but it was better then Spawn. I loved Blade. The first 40 minutes and the last 50 minutes are worth every second. Stephen Dorff is OUTSTANDING as Frost, but maybe a little miscasting mistake was made on Wesley's side. But if Wesley declined then Will Smith would have gotten the role (I'm guessing). I love the final showdown. Great ending which hints to a sequel and cant wait till it comes out. Blade is fantastic!"
5,great action movie with awesome special effects,This is a great movie if you like action movies. The storyline does not interfere with action. It has some great effects. The train scene is awesome on dolby digital.
1,Where was the writing?,"I thought this movie had great action, great special effects, and terrible writing. Everything that happens in the movie is a cheesy, overdone cliche - but if you don't care about well-written movies, it's an entertaining action flick. I personally thought it was terrible, but some people love this kind of movie."
2,Don't bother,"Especially if you have any interest in Vampires in fiction or movies. Blade totally mishandles the genre. I mean vampires in the sulight because they're wearing coverup? Give me a break. And could the plot have been more predictable? Just what was the point of N'Bushe Wright's characther, Dr. Karen Jenson? She certainly didn't add anything to the film, unless you count that conspicuously added plot twist that foils all those evil vampires in the end--the plot twist which was, I might add, about the lamest development in the entire movie. Now I really like Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff, but not even they could make this movie fly."
2,Uhhhhh.... whaaaaaaat?,"I really hope the people who wrote the reviews here aren't a random sampling of the population. The bad guys had the ""cowboys and indians disease"" in that they couldn't hit the broadside of a barn with a machine gun, the acting was mostly bad, there were ridiculous amounts of blood, the plot was somewhat inconsistent, and I fail to see how a god could be vulnerable to chemical reactions. I thought the beginning scene was somewhat clever, but from there the entire movie went downhill.Fortunately, if you turn your brain off the movie can be entertaining."
1,HORRIBLE,"This movie wasn't as good as everyone says it is. The action was phony, Snipes did a bad acting job, and there was more gore than I expected. I also found it hard to believe that a man could walk down the street in broad daylight with the handle of a sword sticking out the back of his coat without anyone noticing it."
1,No No No,"the original ratio is 1:2,35 = cinemascope also on DVD, But here on Blu-ray is the ratio fu..ing 1:1,78 = 16:9 TV-widescreen) my question is WHY !!!!! don't buy is blu-ray !!!!!"
1,1 and 1/2 hours of my life I'll never get back,"dont even bother, unless you're just in it for the fashion and score (some nice techno sounds)."
1,Yuck!,"Garbage! Pure Garbage. What was this film lacking? Oh Yea: Plot, Interesting Characters, Detail,any sense of story,and good acying. No actor in this movie is even decent. They all lack a sense of character.This Movie Just Sucks!"
3,"Good effects, bad movie","Citizen Kane it's not.... It may not even be Passenger 57....but it is certainly not without its redeeming qualities. I saw this movie in the theaters, and I was unimpressed with the plot and acting, and particularly with the screenplay. The dialogue was dumb, the stroyline had gaping holes, and the ending was pretty obvious. But man, this is one hell of a violent movie, with some serious special effects. True to it's billing, Blade (Wesley Snipes), pretty much spends the entire movie killing vampires. The first ten or so minutes are a long, well-choreographed fight, that kept me pretty excited. There's a hour or so in between that and the last ten minutes, which are another terriffic scene. I'm sure the DVD will give any home theater system a real work out, with some serious blacks and dark colors, lots of imaging and steering with the surround channels, and some major league LFEs. Buy it for the spectacle, and not for the story."
5,Seriously Hype Movie,"Blade is definately the best movie of 98.With this movie Wesley Snipes proves he's still on top of his game. The movie had everything, action packed martial arts and even a hint of comedy. The scenes were incrediable. Not giving away anything, but the first scene will be your favorite. The movie was the bomb from the beginning to the end, you'll be upset that it had to finish.Whatever you do make it a priority to see this movie. It won't disappoint you, you'll be talking about it for weeks!!"
4,Just a perfect action movie!!,"If you love vampires and a little hong kong type action, you will love ""Blade"". It moves along at a good pace, it is visual stunning, [the opening scene in the meat room/disco say's it all], and Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff are great! Bring on the sequel!"
4,frosted perfection...,"Forget about slayers, Deacon Frost's character is enigmatic enough to make you want to BE a vampire. Dorff's portrayal of the antagonist is charismatic, intelligent, sexy and evil. What makes him truly evil is his thirst for power which pales even his thirst for blood. Ruthless yet beautiful, Frost is an unforgettable antagonist... ...THe history of how Blade comes to be half vampire/ half human, i thought was rather cheesy. And how contemporary vampire slayers have now become more of a buff, black leather wearing, ...kicking kung fu pro is a little bit of a turn off. True, that the image IS appealing in a sense that it's an idealistic Hollywood image that everyone loves, but does it have to be that stereotypical? Even their imperfections are perfectly portrayed... and almost expected.in any case, the film in general was good. i liked the comic-to-film adaptation like other films adapted from comics ie spawnthe house of erabus reminds me of Vampires: The Masquerade."
4,Sharp blade,I think blade is a good movie.I think Wesley Snipes is awesome but I think his swords and blades were so cool.I also think the fight scenes were awesome.
4,Very good special effects and full of action!,"Wesley Snipes was the big draw on this movie for me, he is buffed and tough as Blade. I liked the movie, the soundtrack is very good and the action is excellent, especially the scene where Blade grabs on to the back of the train, that was pretty cool. One more for my video collection!"
4,Unbelievable Action...,"Well, I don't think the story will get very high praise, but the intense and violent action makes it an entertaining movie to watch..."
4,in my top five catagory of vampire flicks,"this was excellent.i own it on dvd actually it was the first dvd movie i bought when my dad got a dvd player.its number 3, behind from dusk til dawn and interview with the vampire"
2,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?,"Come on now, this movie blows. Not much of a storyline, and whats up with all the blood and gore? I don't remember any of that in the comic. However, it's full of fast action and mind boggling special effects, so it ain't all bad."
2,"Good action and effects,but poor acting and story","I rented this to compare it with John Carpenter's Vampires and it falls apart when matched up. I has more blinding fast action scenes and some really cool effects (and some bad computer effects too).Wesley Snipes didn't even play the quiet butt kicker very well. He made this weird grimace throughout the whole movie,and had no personality or acting skills. Steven Dorff was just as bad.He looked and acted like a disheveled college kid who stayed up all night to study,than a vampire. I didn't really see a story,just quick MTV style action set-pieces.Oh well,rent it if you like action and hate good characters,story,and logic."
4,Adrenaline Rush Action,"Blade was a treat to watch. I took my girlfrind, who though we were going to ""Ever After"", and she loved it too. The begining 10 minutes and the last 15 are the best. After the movie I left the theatre ready to fight a few vampires myself."
4,The movie was more than a vampire hero. One word: ACTION,Wesley Snipes have done it again. This movie was great. The special effects and fight scenes truely made this movie a hit.
4,"I liked it, but the bloody scenes were a little overdone.","I loved the movie. Blade has always been a favorite comic book hero of mine and I think Westley Snipes played him perfectly. The only thing I didn't like was that, when my apernets watched it and saw all the bloody scenes (such as the night club in the beginning and the people that get bit all through the movie) and they took the tape I bought with my hard-earned money and threw it in the trash can!! I think that they should have toned those scenes down some."
3,Marvel Comic's first good movie.,This movie makes me exited to see X-Men which is coming out next year (I won't get my hopes too high tough). If too gorey for young comic book readers then perfect for older ones. Mostly true to the comics but i would have liked to see little Marvel details like a swinging Spider-Man in the backround or the Avengers' mansion. This is an action movie with plot and supense. The fate of the world hangs in the balance and you will believe every minute of it.
4,Better than Spawn,"This is a cool film which I think is much bettr than Spawn. I thought that Wesley Snipes was extremely good as the unemotional Blade, but this film lacked a bit of depth and character. This nightclub scene at the beginning started the film off well, however"
3,Looooong,"I think Wesley Snipes is wasted in the movie and you can almost predict how it's gonna end. Although, some of the special effects were cool!"
3,Blade - What Can I say...,"What can I say about this movie... I liked it, but it took a while to grow on me. I can see this movie as being very much, for the boys.Bieng a fan of the old television show ""Forever Knight."" I see ""Blade"" as being a look at the darker side vampirism. Maybe even a darker look at my old favorite show.As for ""Blade,"" I rather enjoyed the Martial Arts action. The movie also had me dumping popcorn on my lap! Blade would be a great movie to see on Hollween.Beware of nightmares from young viewers."
5,The definition of DVD,"If there is one DVD worth owning its this one. After the Spawn movie left much to be desired, die hard comic book fans like myself awaited the release for Blade with mixed emotions, and what we got was a gem. Wesley Snipes brings the vampire hunter Blade to life in this martial arts blood soaked action epic. The special effects are jawdropping and the DVD picture and sound quality will leave your mouth watering in amazement. Stephen Dorff plays villanous vampire Deacon Frost and Kris Kristofferson is great as Blade's mentor Whistler (great move getting him for this movie by the way), and ex pornstar Traci Lords stars as Deacon's vampire girlfriend. With the release of 2000's X-Men, and the upcoming Spider-Man and Daredevil movies, the future of good comic book adapted films looks great."
4,"Violence, Violence and more Vilolence!!!!!!!","The makers of this movie thought that there is never enough violence. Now, for teenage boys this is a great movie. But for others it may be a little much."
3,"Typical comic book action, but that's it.","Apart from the action sequences and some good visual effects, I found the movie quite boring and dragging. I didn't know where it was going or what the director was intending. And the ending (the Russia sequence) was completely unncecessary and added to the movie's downfall. It should have been left out. I guess I shouldn't have expected too much, though, from a comic book action movie."
4,"Great fun, finally an action vampire film.","No Vampire seduction scenes, just shoot em up, cut em up, and battle on. Enjoyable action film."
5,Action packed thriller,This movie keeps you at the tip of your toes the whole time. When the sequal coming otu
5,This movie is AWSOME!!!,"I only buy DVD movies that I love, not like and there was no hesitation to buy this one. I highly recommend this movie to everyone...even those who don't know the comic. Wesley Snipes gave a fantastic performance as always, although I've never seen him this good."
3,The trademark Snipes wit is missing but fun anyway,"This is the type of movie DVD was made for. The bass and rhythm are great on the soundtrack but the dark, brooding images aren't done justice by the technology of VHS. If you're into the vampire genre then you need to own this movie for its unique offering. If you're into Snipes, as I am, you'll miss his trademark wit and coolness. But just let the sound and images wash over you, especially the opening scenes. The opening is worth replay a couple of dozen times. Enjoy."
4,Disappionted,Is a great moive. Very good effects in the blu ray. sound a bit off. Very disappointed that it was not in wide screen. Really wish Amazon would be a bit clearer on the format of a movie.
1,Pretty much another comic book to movie conversion...,I've never been a fan of comic book super heroes including comic to movie conversions such as Judge Dredd and Barb Wire. I enjoyed the Superman movie many years ago and that was about it. Somehow vampires and karate just don't seem to go together. I prefer the more gothic Salem's Lot and Dracula styles. I enjoy slasher/blood/gore/supernatural movies and I think my favourite has to be Wes Craven's Scream.
1,"""IT STUNK""",i THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY STUPID MOVIE AND COULD HAVE BEEN DOWN A LOT BETTER.NOT ENOUGH ACTION.THE WHOLE PLOT WAS STUPID. I DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL
1,"Special Effect, etc...","This vampire film is probably one of the worst vampire films i have seen. It's illogical and silly. This film is made for kids under 10. I don't understand why some people (pls don't take it personally) would give it a thumb up for special effect. You can tell these effects is made of low budget worksatation by very limited resources. Nothing can compare to Terminator, Jurassic Park, Godzilla, etc... I couldn't sit for over 120 mins for this movie. Really waste of time. But enjoy the alternative ending. I think the studios should follow suit like this DVD. Great features, creative. Too bad that I don't like this movie, otherwise, I think it's worth of keeping one."
1,THE WORST VAMPIRE MOVIE!,"Why do everybody like this movie, saying this is ''the best vampire movie''. What a big joke for sure! But i can understand, those people are mostly teenagers who didn't have the pleasure to watch the ''real vampires movies'', specially THE LOST BOYS-the cult teen movie of the 80s and some others great ones, like Fright Night, The Fearless Vampire Killers (a classic), Interview with the Vampire (not so good, but much better than Blade). It's just a matter of search, look and you find, at least five vampire movies better than Blade. The best of all, is certanly, The Lost Boys"
3,"High Gore, Low Action","Blade could have been really good. However, the writers and directors of this film decided to focus on lots of gross, gratuitous gore than on real action. I must admit, the opening is truely awesome. It's probably one of the best action sequences I've seen. After that, though, Blade goes down hill, with only one other cool action scene (which isn't all that great.) With Blade's cool arsenal, including shotguns, automatic pistols, stake launchers, and a katana, and his skill in martial arts, Blade could have been an action masterpiece. I would have also liked to see the katana used more often. Blade isn't a disaster, though. The previously mentioned opening rocks, there are a few suspenful moments, and I like the movie's stylish visual tone. If you're an action fan who isn't squemish or sensitive, you might want to check Blade out. If you're a gore addict, you'll surely enjoy this. Either way, there is more action and better action in many more films."
4,Blade,"Excellent special effects. The story line has a twist from your normal ""tooth and blood"" vampire spoof. Snipe's hard, cool attitude goes well with the character. The special features are enjoyable."
4,Excellent DVD production(almost as good as the Thing),"New Order and Polygon Windows(aka Aphex Twin) included on the Score, pumps this marvel movie into an action/gore behemoth that will eat you alive. Effects are good / bad but the bad gives the movie that b movie appeal. Who said an African American could not be a superhero, Wesley Snipes gives a perfect super hero performance!"
4,You find all about action,A very different vampire film with vampires using high-tech and misterious legends. Plus art of fight with Snipes and amazing PC animations. What else can you expect from an action film? All actors fit their roles perfectly especially Dorff and Snipes. A very good selection for entertainment.
3,the action wasgood and the teens in my house love it.,"well it is not my cup of tea but the Teenage boys here thought it was the ""bomb"" Snipes is good as a hero fighting for all humanity and Kristfferson is ""cool"".....redeye"
1,Do NOT watch this!!,"What can I say? this movie is one of the most horrible I have ever watched, I wish I could have given it -5 stars, and its not even worth it to say why I hate it."
2,"Don't waste your time on this dumb, dumb movie","Blade sucked. If you like depth in your movies this is not for you. If you like artistry in your movies this is not for you. If you like a good plot in your movies this is not for you. If you like suspense in your movies this is not for you. If you like good and realistic characterization in your movies this is not for you.This movie is a sample of the endless line of dumb, hyped, big budgeted, stupid, badly written, superficial, devoid of substance movies that holly wood churns out. The action sequences in this movie are conventional. A mix of karate and generic gun play. The action sequences have no sense of drama, suspense, realism or true coolness. This movie tries very hard to be cool and fails miserably.Blade is a dumb, worthless movie."
1,THIS MOVIE REALLY BITES,I GAVE THIS MOVIE TWO CHANCE -ONCE @ THE MOVIES THE SECOND AT A FREINDS HOUSE.IT BLEW ME AWAY WITH BOARDOM AND STUPIDITY.BASED OFF A HALF MAN/HALF VAMPIRE-CHARETER FROM THE OLD DRACULA COMIC BOOK SERIES(late 70's).BLADE TAKES YOU ON ALOUD GANGLAND /SHOOT THEM UP ROMP.OH YAH AND MUST NOT FORGET THE VAMPS -TAKING OVER THE WORLD WITH AID OF THERE EXSTRONG SUNBLOCK.HAVE NOT SEEN THIS IN A COUPLE OF YEARS AND WITH ANY LUCK I WILLNOT SEE IT AGAIN..LOL
1,awful,"hmmmmm part human part vampire hybrid becomes a vampire hunter, can you say: ""every other vampire movie ever made?"".but wait here's the twist... the lead character ...is black.sadly that is the only original thing in this movie.i believe that if ""a clockwork orange"" were to be re-written today, instead of going into detail about the violence in the films alex was forced to watch, they would simply say: ""The men in white coats lifted his eybrows and made him watch blade""oh i forgot, you probably haven't read a book that doesn't have picture's, because the people who enjoyed blade are the same people who think ""the rock"" can act."
1,terrible movie,this was one of the worst flics I have seen. I hope Stephen Dorff never lowers himself to do this in another movie.
5,"Snipes, the Perfect 'Blade'","Smooth as a motha, Wesley Snipes plays the half-vampire, half-human. He is a 'daywalker' and he slays vampires (just because) at night. You scratch his sunglasses, it's your buttocks. Deacon Frost (pasty white boy) wants to become the ultimate vampire, so Blade must stop him. I don't know what the fat blob of a kid was all about, but it was disgusting. It looked like a huge pile of mashed potatoes with a face. Blade slices and dices many and people will get a kick out of the red shower at the beginning of the movie. ""There are worse things out there besides vampires, me,"" said Blade. Damn right. This is definitely one of the coolest vampire movies ever."
4,Kick me in my behind techno vampire slayings,"This movie is a must see, there is a plot somewhere but it does not matter, the fight scenes and fx does the talking. Gorehounds will have a blast and all is well. Disepointing that there where no interview with Stephen Norrington (director) among all those supplement matrial. Banned in Norway"
4,Nice songs and effects in a good movie,A good movie with a logical history. Good songs and visual effects. A really nice menu and extras are included. An DVD to have in your collection
4,"All action, All slaying","Blade was a good action movie with nothing but blood, fighting, and vampires. I rate it a four star movie."
3,What a vampire movie!,What can I say about this vampire movie? This really was a pretty good movie. There was a lot of action and I think everyone in the movie did pretty well with their part. The beginning spooked me a little bit because the part with the blood pooring over the vampires at the night club-that scene just freaked me out. I think Stephen Dorff is extremely adorable.
3,Blade is a great movie for people who like vampires,BLADE I think blade is a great movie and is one of the best vampire movies of all time
5,I used to be so obbsessed with this movie..........!,"i used to be so obbsessed with the movie blade, but now im getting over it a little.but i still absolutley praise this magnificent movie, the main reason i loved this movie was stephen dorff's character ""deacon frost""......not only is he sexy, he also brouhgt depth and mystery to the film, he was the best part of the film!! the only part i didnt get about this movie is when frost called the blood gad ""la magra"" and the world was supposed to turn into a bunch of vampires right? well anyways, i still loved the whole movie, if you havent seen it, go see it."
5,This is easily one of the best action flicks ever made,"This film brings back the classic sword fight scenes of the early Zorro's, and gunfights worthy of High Noon. Wesley Snipes has the ultimate vampire hunter thing going here. The sword fights are not anticipatory of where the strikes are going to be, as they are in most of these movies. While some parts of this film may be a little graphic, it shouldn't bother most viewers and the rest of the film makes up for it. This is a definite must see."
5,The movie is the best yet!,This movie is the BEST out there on the market it had the best action and story line to keep you in your seat. If you haven't seen I would get it. The dvd version has two ending that make it better.
4,"lack of originality,and cheesy but entertaining","This movie is all of the summary above but is entertaining nonetheless.Noone watches this movie expecting a plot or story.Just action and lots of it.Although it has almost no originality.This formula has been done before:The Lost Boys,Vampires,From Dusk Till Dawn,Bram Stoker's Dracula,etc"
5,If you appreciate Martial Arts & you love ACTION THIS IS IT.,"If you are a Martial Artists or if you enjoy the Martial Arts, and you love action this is it! This is one of the best video. (It's a plus if you are a Marvel Fan, it compliments the comic book.) Vampires, Martial Arts, Action and Graphics = ***** (5 stars) in my book! An excellent movie!!! A+"
5,Wonderful portrayl of a Legendary character,"I don't always believe movies honor the characters upon which they are based upon. However, in Blade the director and writer did an exceptional job. Wesley Snipes was the perfect legendary half-vampire, half-human, Blade. The special effects were very well done as well as the quality of acting in the film. While I like the vampire as the narrator or star, this movie was a terrific blend. It showed the human and vampire perspective on things instead of one way or the other. The ending was a marvelous opening for the upcoming sequel."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"This is a pretty good movie. I have to admit being a bit surprised that they did as good a job as they did, given _Spawn_ and any number of bad comic to movie transitions.Wesley Snipes does a good job, and Kris Kristofferson is a pleasant surprise.Now the DVD itself is awesome, it sets a high standard for others to follow. THere are jsut so many cool extras here.I would definitely reccomend this one."
5,This is a movie worth watching for all vampire lovers.,"I really like the original Blade.When I first saw it in the theater,I felt the visual effects where new and I still like watching it."
3,kinda good,had some cools scenes. computer effects looked pretty fake sometimes. main badguys death was pretty stupid. rent this one and by the second.
2,A fantastic disappointment,"Power-hungry vampire Dorff plans to resurrect an ancient blood god by using the blood of the ""Day-walker"", a half-man, half-vampire warrior named Blade (Snipes) who's the blood-sucker's most feared enemy. Ultra-graphic with some of the most stylish martial-arts scenes filmed in American cinema, but after an incredible start the film becomes silly and in-jokey and ends rather appallingly. Based on the comic book."
2,"Banal, Even Considering it Was Based On A Comic Book","You will be bored. Tiresome and bland, this movie doesn't even try to be consistent: are vampires destroyed by sunlight or not? Blade's tiresome, self-pitying whining is unbearable. What was with the fat guy ?"
2,Blade Bites,"After watching the movie Blade, I've got to say that it, well, it bites. (Sorry, couldn't resist.) Wesley Snipes is buffed up, but with no place to go. I can't imagine a more one dimensional performance than the one he mailed in on this movie. Come to mention it, just about the entire cast seemed to sleepwalk their way through this. Stephen Dorff was the notable exception, with a solid and sinister performance. In defense of the movie, there are some very stylish camera work, such as the ""bloody disco"" scenes. Soundtrack pretty much rocks, and a nice use of Kung-Fu fight coreography and Japanese manga images help out. But still not enough to really recommend this movie as anything other than 2 hours worth of mind numbing fluff. Hey, I like sci-fi as much as the next person, probably a lot more than the next person, but this movie comes across as toothless."
4,"A great movie, but not enough action","This is an action movie , don't get me wrong, but this movie should've cut down the movies screen time by atleast 15 minutes or so. This movie is about 110 minutes or so, and it has about the same amount of action that a 90 minute movie has. That extra 20 minutes aint helping it...Most good action ,movies have a pre-fight where the hero encounters the villain , but none of them dies, they just test eachother's strengths and weeknesses, like in blade 2, blade and Nomak meet and have a fight, but none of them is elimated. In face/off, the 2 characters meet several times, but never kill eachother until the end. They could've added the bad dude into the fight so blade and him could've gotten a taste of eachother before they actually killed eachother. But anyways, could've been better."
5,The movie could have taken place in Russia,"I really was anxious that this film should have taken place in in the country of Russia. I thought the picture of Blade being in Russia talking to that vampire before they dueled was I thought very interesting. The movie has alot of action, and fight scenes. The acting is high quality on this picture. This first part to Blade does not state where they are at all.They are just living in this chaotic world where people are hungry for power, burglary etc. And Blade's job is to kill the vampires before they take over the Earth. It is a picture well done. Highly recommended to all sci fi fans, horror movie fans, etc."
1,HI WESLEY SNIPES HERE,"HI HAVN'T GOT LONG, GOT TO SAY TA FOR SUPPORTING BLADE, IT WAS FUN TO DO. GOT TO GO BE BACK SOON."
1,A WASTE OF TIME,"I cannot believe I wasted my time on this movie. It was such a disapointment. There was barely any dialogue. Wesley Snipes said, what, maybe 5 words in the whole movie. The ending didn't even make sense. I don't even know why they bothered making a sequel to this terrible movie. I only wish I could give this movie 0 stars. This was a ridiculous, cheesy, big fat waste of money of a movie."
1,Awful!,I collect Vampire movies but this was dreadful. It features Snipes at his most shallow and contrived. He bacically plays a flat lawnmowe style vampire killer. He literally walks into rooms ful of vampires and mows them down. Yawn. As far as action films this ranks with such stale bashers as Demolishman.
3,A Missed Opportunity,"""Blade"" was transferred to BD format good enough to enjoy. I wouldn't say the movie did a good job making ""Blade"" into HD format. The BD version is missing a title screen and special features. ""Blade"" BD is still good though if you don't care about the special features and stuff. The movie company missed a chance to make ""Blade"" even better than it originally was."
4,"Great movie, bad spec. effects, though very good quality DVD","It's a cool movie, but the special effects are too computerized, blood is like cartoons, and morphing of faces just doesn't look scary. But the movie itself is great and the sound+picture quality are stunning.The story is god too. Definetely a buyer"
5,"Blade was the best, where is the sequil to top all sequils?","I think Blade was quite possibly the worlds BEST movie. If I could, I would give the movie 100 stars. I have seen the movie over 30 times, I own the book, soundtrack, and DVD. This movie NEVER gets old. I hope they make a sequil, and knowing Snipes, it will be another 5 star movie. Tell me when it's out, i'll be the first in line to see it........"
4,Great movie with all the extras you could ask for on a DVD!,"I saw this movie in the theatre and its just as good on DVD. Plus all the extras make this DVD well worth the $$$. Hopefully other companies will follow Blade's lead in including all the goodies like trailers, profiles, alternate endings (although this alternate ending is pretty bad) and extra documentaries. Blade itself is a good movie, by far not the best ever, but a good thrill ride. This is one I wouldn't mind a sequel to."
4,A fun exciting ride,"If you're looking for dark comic book action (well done), its worth while to watch Blade one and two. It is a bit too dark and angry for me but I do enjoy a good tale of avengers, and revengers (my word). For instance, Constantine is one of my favorite movies, even if it does star Keanu Reeves. He is the right person for the job. Blade fills this kind of niche. So if you like that kind of dark comic book violence, give it a try."
3,No subtitle,"The movie is great, however, I'm a little disappointed because there is no subtitle even in English. I really don't understand this kind of stuff."
5,Entertaining action movie from start to finish!,"Blade is an action-packed movie with lots of blood, gore, violence, and special effects. The opening sequence in the nightclub is excellent and the plot moves along nicely, never slowing down with some genuinely chilling moments and cool special effects. Wesley Snipes plays the part of Blade so good you never doubt his character. Also, Stephen Dorrf is excellent as Frost, the new leader of the vampires, and Kris Kristofferson makes a remarkably good performance as Whistler, Blade's human sidekick. The fight scenes in the movie were some of the best I have ever seen along with a tight soundtrack. The special effects in Blade are very good as is the art direction, set design and makeup.Overall an excellent action movie equipped with a good plot and an energetic screenplay. I would recommend Blade to anyone who likes action/horror movies with the DVD version being a must see due to the alternate ending!"
4,Let's just hope BLADE 3 will be like this,"I like this movie, i like blade, i like the story, i like blade 2. But the Blade series is slowly slipping into the while Batman downfall. Blade 2 started it all, where the filmakers give us less story and plot and mystery, and exchange it for flashy gaudy colorful sets and mindless action. In batman 1, the color scheme was simple, black, white, and grey. It had a sort of haunting theme to it, which i liked a lot. In blade 2, we are with black and white and gray, with a little bit of tan thrown into it. Which also creates the haunting effect of a good movie. Then batman made Batman returns and batman forever, and if u didn't notice, batman turned into a haunting superhero to nothing but a kids action figure. I just hope in blade 3 they stick to the same story and plot line, and give it some of the same color scheme that made the first blade movie so scary and likeable. Hopefully you people will know what i mean."
4,Bloodbath,"I love the beginning of this movie with the bloodbath and the fighting. And the music is killer, the soundtrack is a must have if you like Techno! I like the half human half vampire, superbeing, with a purpose!"
3,Some good action and horror... but not-so-good script.,"I like vampires, I like action movies. But I found Blade to be a dissapointment because of the somewhat weak and unbelievable (not in the suspension of disbelief category, but in the ""Give me a break, any vampire with half a clue wouldn't do that..."" category) character actions and plot contrivances pretty much kept this film from getting off the ground for me. I did like the techo-vampire rave."
3,"Oh, Blade!","I like Wesley in just about anything he does. He is very talented. This movie moves along quite well, the younger, brash vampires want to take over everyting from the older, classer vampires. Kids, I guess every species has trouble with them! Whodathunk it? Enjoy!"
2,A BETTER CHOICE THERE MUST BE,"There can be only 1... wait.. wrong movie. so. Blade. What is there to say? Wesley Snipes is good. convincing even. I was impressed with him. But that does not constitute a good reason to buy or even watch this movie. lots of action. minimal story. pretty useless. Go find a nice cheesy romance to watch with your special someone. Gentlemen prefer blonds, perhaps. you have a life. dont waste 2 hours on this.josh"
2,Nobody likes Wesley Snipes anyway,"My thoughts at the beginning of the movie ran along the lines of a confused ""ok...""Basically the storyline goes that Blade (Snipes) goes around trying to kill vampires in modern cities. However the vampires seem to be fighting amongst themselves too - one particularly bad vampire named Frost overthrows the other vampires and tries to get himself to become a blood god or somesuch. I really didn't get what was going on with that - and I'm not sure I was meant to either.Anyway this movie offers some handy tips on vampire combat: crosses don't work, garlic and silver do.Snipes performs to his usual average standard of acting and puts up a mediochre performance, except in the fight scenes which turn out pretty well. He fails to display much emotion besides hatred for vampires. However, his outfit in the movie is a plus.A pretty typical storyline and an average cast is offset by decent special FX and some good fightscenes - not worth paying money to watch."
1,Bloody Hell,"This could have been a good, or even great, comic book adaptation. The beginning promises a lot, with appropriate dark visuals, a well-created and intriguing atmosphere and some well-done action sequences. Sadly, after the first minutes the plot gets derivative and predictable, wretching an interesting and original concept. This urban, futuristic and edgy look at vampires ends up being a letdown, consisting in sequences of random fight scenes with plenty of gore moments, loud music, cardboard characters and campy acting. This is unfortunate, since it has some creative visual elements, which aren`t enough to make it more than a bad b-movie that`s just way too ridiculous to take seriously. It`s not entertaining, either, not even in a so-bad-it's-good-way, so the disappointment is even bigger. Innocuous."
3,Ridiculously bloody...,"""Blade"" is an entertaining film. It's one of those movies that I take guilty pleasure in liking. But it could have been just as entertaining without the graphic excess. In my worthless opinion, true thrills, chills and scares aren't judged on the amount of gore and blood. Okay, okay the action sequences and special effects were mighty impressive, I'll give it that. And fighting vampires probably really is a messy business. But that opening scene with the sprinkler system dance party was just outright tasteless. I did like the relationship between Snipes and Kristofferson however."
4,A Marvel Character FINALLY does good!!!,For the first time Marvel Comics has released a movie with the right amount of money to make an excellent motion picture. Wesley Snipes is Blade. He has made him a reality. The special effects are out standing. THIS IS A MUST SEE and MUST OWN!!!!!
3,Great action but slow story plot.,I like all the special effects but I didn't like the story plot of the movie. DVD with it special interview and extra information made this a good buy.
5,"very good exciting from the beginning, take you breath away","A movie that will not let you get up and leave for popcorn or even go to the bathroom. Too realistic, it can really happen in these living times. The night club scene was fantastic when snipes killed all of those vampires, and the fire scenes WOW!!!!!!"
5,two thumbs up....way up!!!,"when i first rented this movie i thought it would be a bore but,it was the best movie i have ever seen!!it had action,gore and comedy!!it was very exciting and had real graphic vampire seens.i suggest you buy it cause its worth more than what you will be paying!!!!beleive me."
5,"Best film ever, kicks arse.","Best film ever, brilliant graphics, good acting, best speical effects ever, cool comtumes, weapons and story. IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS FILM, WATCH IT, BUY IT, HOW CAN ANY BODY NOT LIKE THIS FILM!!!!!!"
4,GE 22714 HDMI Switch,"Was easy to install, however for the sound to work from the HD TV, I have to turn on both input devices."
5,Positive use in family counselling,"I can't say enough for this fine video, Teen Biz. I have used it in my private counseling practice for both single and two parent households. I find it extremely helpful in helping step-parents and step-children, as well as step-siblings to bond. It provides a much needed way for teens to identify and set their own goals, and formulate effective patterns toward meeting them. The follow up help to the video on line and by mail is wonderful! I would recommend the Teen Biz video to anyone seeking to explore independent careers. I especially like the fact that the video explores the What to do aspects of starting a business, as well as the How to. It's entertaining, informative for adults as well as teens.Doris B. Stocker Flint, Michigan"
4,Worth taking with me,I recently purchased this book from a local bookstore and found it very informative. It had a balanced view of history and was entertaining reading. I am planning on taking the book with me as I travel Switzerland. It seems to have a good selection of hotel and restaurant offerings and I can't wait to get there. I find that the Frommers books as well as the on-line site at frommers.com are very valuable to the budget minded traveler. I paid more for the book than Amazon is selling it for so it is a good value from Amazon.
2,"Good as reference, not for much else","I purchased a copy of this book to help with my summer research internship in Switzerland in 2001, and found it to be less useful than the Rough Guides.The Fromer book is written as a fairly terse reference book, listing a few restaurants, hotels of various price ranges, and not much else for the different cities. Sure, there are listings of attractions for the different cities, but the way they are presented is not very helpful to plan trips. On the other hand, the Rough Guides have suggestions on things to do for the different places.So all in all, it depends on your style of planning but I feel that this book is more suited to business travelers."
3,OK - but double check the info,This book clearly provides some useful information - but more often than not we found that the places referenced may be somewhat lower standard than expected when you read the book. So use the book - but be flexible and prepared to change your ideas when you reach your destiation
3,Muslim History from a Muslim Perspective,"Akbar S. Ahmed lays out for the reader the history of Islam in a quick read. He spends time on Spain, Turkey, Iran, and India/Pakistan. He also obviously loves and admires his religion. This leads him to gloss over negative aspects of the regimes he writes about. Overall, an informative and interesting book with a definite bias."
5,Dispelled Misunderstanding,"I gave this book 5 stars more for what it did for me rather than simply literary analysis. This book became the begining of my conversion to Islam. After reading this book it allowed me to open myself to look at Islam much more seriously than I had before. On a literary basis, the author is not as objective as I believe he tries to come accross. He is clearly pro-islam and consequently some of his arguments/observations sound contrived."
3,Not as tightly written as his earlier book,"This book is not of the same quality as his earlier book ""Postmodernism and Islam"". I felt let down, but maybe the contents match the title ""a SHORT INTRODUCTION to the Muslim World"" i.e. he sacrifices breadth for depth. Having read the earlier book I get the impression that Ahmed spent just a few weekends typing this one up. Why? Because, to name a few, (1) the structure of thoughts is not clear - you don't get a clean idea of what path he plans to take through the book; (2) there are so many spelling mistakes that could have been avoided by running the manuscript through a spell checker; (3) there aren't references for many of the very grand and important things he says; (4) he picks Iran, Turkey and Pakistan as Muslim countries to write about the past but does not spend much time on those countries with the largest Muslim populations e.g. India, Indonesia, Bangladesh etc."
2,Horrible movie,"The price of the movie was good and so was the condition. The movie, on the other hand, was the most terrible piece of crap I have ever seen. I have no clue how I heard about it, but it looks like the cost of the production was 50 bucks and it make no sense at all."
4,Good Fun Questions but not real difficult,"I am enjoying doing this book, but I would have prefered more difficult question. The real joy of this book is the size of the puzzles and questions, not tiny and not huge.Great fun."
2,Ridiculous ending,"I think the biggest problem I had with this movie was her utter complete lack of power. Though I will say I actually said ""yes"" out loud when she stood up for herself during the one major meeting. The rest of the movie was pretty predictable - though the ending was just utterly stupid - it simply made NO sense with everything that had gone on.I wish that for once the makers of these movies would choose a woman (or man) that actually thinks outside the box rather than always ""reacting"" to circumstances. Thus the ""bad"" guy can manipulate everything at will - thus becoming very predictable. For once I really would like to see the ""victim"" be unpredicatable as well.The movie was creppy in its way - thus my two star rating versus just one."
3,AVERAGE FILM THAT TRIES TO MIMIC LYNCH,"This film attempts a David Lynch fare in french. It fails but the dream sequences were the most interesting. It is a story about an extremely popular doctor who drugs female patients to cop a feel or worse. These scenes were scary. Apparently, the handsome doctor who is relentlessly pursued by nurses cannot relate to women who are awake until, a newcomer arrives that he affectionately calls, Bambi. They have a weird relationship that turns into a cat and mouse game that keeps it light on suspense. I liked the premise but was disappointed in the resulting product.Although the story is heavy on the ""ick"" factor, it misses the mark in a telling a warped story that compels. It is well acted but there is too much missing that would make me recommend it to others. It ends with unbelievable sequences that ruined it for me. I hate watching movies that unravel at the end....."
2,dont buy it,"I git this album at a used record store.It a album i shoudnt have gotten.The music does remind you of black sabbath ,but on a bad day.The same lyric are repeated over and over again ,and the musis is terrible.Some classic stonner might like this type of music ,but to me it usless the songs go nowhere.Save your money."
2,Se quedaron,"Este cd no es comparacion con lo que fue CD00. Lamentablemente no se ve una evolucion en su musica, es mas me parece que intentaron hacer un album liviano y divertido y terminaron echandole mucho ""cheese"" y quedo enpalagoso! A mi me gusto el CD00 por su originalidad y buen ritmo, y eso parece no conectar con este nuevo cd. La unica cancion buena es Love Colada y Aum Aum y para un album de 13 canciones es bastante mal. Sorry!Lamentable."
3,batman in the year 1900,"This story takes place in the year 1900 where bruce wayne works as a psychiatrist in arkham asylum.The book is very short and the story is not the best, but I liked it.Batman doesnt have his futuristic artillery that makes formidable and simply uses his hands and feet to battle his foes.Im not the kind of reviewer to spoil the story witch I can honestly explain in this review, thats how short the story is, but I always like to read a different take and setting on fictional characters, especially comic book characters.The only reason Im giving this book 3 stars is because its very short, the book is very thin just to let you know."
1,Worst Buy ever,"BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This product is super cheap quality and the Car charger stopped working after 2 days, the cell phone case does not fit my LG VX6000 phone as its made for and head phone did not work at all. I would have given 0 stars but I can't. Please do not buy this product. You will hate yourself for doing so."
2,A Complete Dud!,This is the story of Porter Stockman (white reporter) and Lenora Page (black reporter) who rescues him during the LA riots. The romance and love scenes between the two were tepid and I was left wondering why these two would ever come together. Lenora saw racism behind ever door and Porter was the stereotypical white apologetic liberal. The only scene I enjoyed was the one where Lenora's friends - Pauline and Cleo met Porter for the first time when they showed up unexpectedly at Lenora's place. Porter showed some backbone when Lenora gave the impression to her firends that Porter was merely a colleague rather than someone she was sleeping with. Overall I did not enjoy this book much at all.
4,He say She Say,"He say she say, meeting of the waters is a pretty good book.A bit of a heart tugger but it had most of what I require inreading a love story. I would have liked to have seen a bitmore of them working out that little problem at the end ofthe story because I thought the ending was to rushed, but allin all really a good read."
5,"Great Characters, Great Novel","I truly enjoyed this novel, even though I generally prefer non-fiction to fiction reading. The story takes place in the context of recent events that defined racial and cultural lines for many americans (the Rodney King incident and its aftermath), and the characterization of this powerful relationship between a white man and an african-american woman feels very real. They each demonstrate their humanity and as a couple they struggle with not only differences in their backgrounds but also the extent to which they SHOULD struggle with them. The writing is clean and without pretense and allows the reader to think through and decide for him/herself what to think about the issues described. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of reading this fine work over the last two weeks, and like many good works, it also provoked me to think about broader issues. I look forward to reading Kim McLarin's other work!"
4,"Good, Honest Read","I thought this book was an honest exploration of the complications that come along with a interracial relationship. No relationship is easy to navigate, add in some serious complications and things go south, but McLarin hit and addressed some serious issues that are usually glossed over, or missed altogether, in other novels of the same genre. Those little intracacies is what made this one stand out."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE","This book was the hardest thing in the world to read for the simple fact it was a horrible book. I am so mad that I spent any kind of money on it. I can not stand to read books or even see black women who are so against being with white people especially white men and harp on the black race all the time and I do mean all the time. It seemed as though the character had to prove her blackness all the time it got very annoying very quick. If you have such a big problem being with someone white then why on earth would you have a ""relationship"" with them. This book made me sick and angry and I hope I can save others from making the same mistake I did in buying this book and please, please, please save your money and time and don't read it."
3,Worth a read and added to your collection...,I found this book after seeing it in another person's list of favorites. I am an AVID IR reader and like the stories that deal more with romance. This book was a lot deeper. I was not sure if I would like it after seeing some of the reviews but was excited to get started. It was a slow start but the story took time to build the characters. I liked Lee most of the time. I enjoyed her strength but after a while I wanted to tell her to relax. Porter was interesting to read about. He seemed to have some growth in the novel but I would have liked to seen them grow together more. The ending needed a little more about them coming to terms. It ended too quick for my taste. Overall I liked the book and would tell anyone to give it a chance.
5,Great Novel for a Book Club,This is the perfect book to spark heated intellectual discussion. I loved the storyline and the setting in which it takes place. Character development was superb and the conflict was weaved smoothly into the storyline. Put this on the top of your book club list!
2,Very hard to finish,This was a very difficult book to finish. I didn't see any romance between Lee and Porter. All you read throughout the book is how much injustice against black folks is caused by white people. Lee was so hung up on being true to her blackness that it seems like it was the main theme in the book and not the romance between her and Porter. I finished the book only because I paid for it.
3,A collection of short stories.,"No photographs, charts or maps here - just a series of short stories for those with an interest in the sea and the overall subject of shipwrecks and castaways. Some interesting stories I had not heard before but just as my appetite was whetted - we moved on to the next. A reasonably good read but not one which will last for the duration of a long-haul flight.Nothing here for the serious researcher and having read the book, it is easily forgettable.NM."
3,Disappointing...,"If you own 2K1 and are looking for some great improvements you will be disappointed. Don't misunderstand me, 2K2 is a great football game - probably the best available. The problem is that Sega has spoiled us into expecting dramatic improvements from year to year. Other than a few minor gameplay changes (notice I didn't say improvements), and updated rosters, this is virtually the same game as 2K1."
5,Another great football game from VC.,These guys are video game czars. I can't believe how realistic and fun these sport games from VC are. They make you feel like you are part of the game and could coach a Super Bowl football team. You can even take your skills online and challenge players all over the country. I highly recommend this game.
5,NEW AND IMPROVED.....If such a thing could be done..,"Last years NfL2k1 was hot but this new update of the series is improved. Improved tackling, graphics, animations and new commentary."
4,Review,"There are many probalems with it but unless you have a box of the X and you can get Fever, best game ever, you gotta go with this game. Players need to catch the ball more often but all you need to do is run the ball a few times before you start passing, the game forces you to run AND pass for a change witch is good and bad. Also Rookie is to easy and Pro gets a little unfair like all games. They should of put a level between the two. The only thing that upset me is on the franchise someone ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS retires too early if your team is young. So after 4 seasons you strat trading away Moss, Manning, Anderson, and even James or they will retire on you. They game would be 100 times better for people who like Fantasy stuff if the would of gotten rid of that clitch, but a ten year time limit (likes fever's dynasty), or made rookies who would get good quicker. All in all it gets 4 stars. After fever you can't give it a 5. But it's the next best thing. It gets my vote."
4,2k the best yet,nfl2k was better than 2k the graphics and game did not move like a real nfl the first one 2k moved like a real nfl game or should i say flowed properly if they slowed 2k2 down it will succeed but inreality the new king in town is the sega 2k series hands down better than anything ea offers
5,Sega scores with NFL 2K2,"Outstanding graphics, great gameplay, and all new 2001-2002 rosters. What a great game! The graphics in this game are incredibily lifelike. Probably the video game that looks closest to real life. The gameplay is outstanding. Great controls. Play as your favorite team; including the Houston Texans. NFL 2K2 is just as good on Dreamcast as it is PS2."
2,And the ball is dropped.....AGAIN!!!,"alright...i was just like the rest of you dream-heads out there...anxiously awaiting the arrival of NFL2K2...and then it was here. i was so psyched! boy what a lame release from VC. c'mon...i've been playin' football, hockey, baseball vid games for years, and this game is just poor. for one, the passing game is simply ridiculous. more dropped passes than any game i have ever seen. no created players in franchise? lame. plus, why can't you use the directional on menu screens??? stupid stupid stupid. seriously, nfl2k1 was and still is an amazing game...nfl2k2 was simply rushed and it shows. yeah, there are great player animations, and the graphics are a little tighter, big whoopie. this game is a waste of money if you already have nfl2k1. i gotta tell ya, i miss EA Sports after seeing this effort from VC. i'm already in line for an x-box, and ea-sports will be my premiere choice again....."
3,Repackaged NFL2K1,"I have been playing this for a week and it is no different to 2K1other than the updated rosters and new Randy (0-2) Moss cover.The glitches are still there, defensive backs bend over right as their about to intercept the ball and wide receivers break free,and I don't know what games these programmers watch but I don't see to many 300= lbs linemen chasing running backs outside and 10 yards downfield and then diving fullout to make a tackle and I think when a linebacker weighing 240 hits a WR at 185 he's going down HARD not barging his way through and picking up an extra 20 yards. All i'm asking for is a little bit of realism, sit down and watch a game or to or go the pros and ask but please do better with 2K3."
3,Okay but not great!,"I hope, really hope that this game Is better than the last one.A lot of people harp on how great this game Is but I don't see It. Money plays abound In the last two versions( I ran the same all streaks play and got a touchdown each time I did It)and It did matter the team, or who I was playing against.I will hold my breath and hope this one Is really Improved."
2,In what world is this yellow???,"I never write reviews, but here's one I had to for future buyers. The picture shows a beautiful, consistent yellow gravel. This is not what arrived. Initially I thought they accidentally sent me green but it was what they called yellow. It was light, yellowish green, but definitely green. Also, it was not solidly painted, it was speckled with color that covered most of these rounded pebbles but was not solidly covered which makes it look cheap. I also didn't appreciate having to pull out twigs that counted as part of my 5lbs a bag, they were also poorly painted. I don't recommend this ""yellow"" or the product itself in any other color based on the quality I received."
3,Two Lips Women's Sally Pump,"The shoe runs small. Be sure to order a half size up. Other than that, it was a beautiful shoe. I gave them to my niece. The price was unbeatable on the day that I purchased them (19.97), so I didn't bother returning them. Loved the shoe, but it was too small."
5,PS2 version rock,"The developers barely improve upon the control, but the storyline continues to become intriguing as Claire searches for her brother."
2,Fun game but too much running around and not enough ammo,"Resident Evil Code: Veronica X has a great story plot. Fun action and many things to do. But there is a constant running around, and you are always in need of the guide to play the game. You continue through the game, only to remember you have forgotten a certain item in the deposit box and it gets very annoying becuase you can only carry like 5 things at a time. Your saves are limited, and you have extremely low ammo. The directional buttons are extremely strange and you spend the first hours of the game learning how to move your character. Since you can't move right you are constantly getting bit by zombies and losing health which you can't recover because there are barely any green herbs.This is a great game for people who like to have challenge. But if you like fun/scary zombie kicking butt games with somewhat some challenge and action this is not the game for you at all"
1,Worst one yet,"This has to be the worst game i've played in this series. Except for the movies, the game is played in such low lighting you won't be able to see anything. This makes it almost impossible to run from the zombies yet alone kill them. You will get a lighter to start, but it only lets you see yourself get killed. If you add the low lighting to the traditionaly sloppy controls of this series you have one very big step backwards."
1,More of the same... lackluster game,"Graphically, this game is excellent. The premise is similar to that of other Resident Evil games (nasty virus unleased on the city, evil zombies want to eat you, etc). Gameplay is absolutely and boringly identical to other RE games, and indeed every game of this genre Capcom makes. How long does Capcom think people want to watch cutscenes and static environments ? A gamer might think that a successful franchise may want to tweak problems or attempt to improve upon to gameplay in order to stay interesting, but in this case, No. It's a visually stunning, although very boring MOVIE-game with no real replayability. Spend your money elsewhere this time."
4,Resident Evil: Code Veronica X,"I thought this was an okay game.I liked the twists and turns. I did think it was a little too easy to die. I would have given this game five stars, but there aren't enough save points."
4,Best enjoyed by the unitiated,"If you've never played a RE game before, buy this game. You'll be scared out of your mind. The graphics are hauntingly real, and the gameplay is very smooth. It's like being in a horror movie.On the other hand, if you've played previous RE games, this one might not seem so great. It's definitely the best one of the series, but it's still the same kind of game: run away from zombies, conserve ammo, find better guns, and follow an expanding plot that finally leads you to a giant underground base or something. If you've gone through an RE game before, then you just won't be as scared by this one; and being scared is what the RE games are all about."
4,Killing zombies never looked so good.,"RE fans rejoice. Capcom has finally brought it's franchise to PS2. People who haven't really played the RE are missing out on one of the greatest games ever made. Luckily if you are one of those people who has just a PS2, go out and buy it!Although Code Veronica:X offers slick, cleaner graphics, people who have already played the Dreamcast version will find nothing really new here. CVX offers about 10-5 minutes of deleted cinematics (and that's about it). The control scheme is a little frustrating in some areas. And I'm actually getting tired of killing just zombies and 'creatures of the night'. But then again, there is always Devil May Cry.Pros: Almost an exact port of the Dreamcast version.Cons: Almost an exact port of the Dreamcast version."
1,Bof ...,"Good story but the worst game controls interface. As said by many reviewers (i.e. gameshark.com), the character controls are so painful to a modern gamer that during a battle scene, you'll throw your gamepad on the floor."
2,B.O.R.I.N.G,"Don't be fooled by the epic opening FMV, unless you enjoy wandering for hours searching for keys (or adventure game interpretations of keys), working though a boring and convoluted story, and above all not being scared; steer clear.The visuals may have been cutting edge on the dreamcast, but they're pretty bland and washed out on PS2, (not to say that the game should be judged completely on its looks, but it doesn't help)Voice acting is pretty bad, and dialogue is boring.Most disappointing is that none of the monsters are really scary, the best they get is mildly weird/gross.My Opinion: Resident Evil: CVX is boring."
4,A little too easy,"After playing all of the Resident Evil games this one no doubt fits into the category that the 2 and 3. The puzzles are a little too easy and the items don't really need to be searched for because it is almost as though they are just given to you. The most difficult thing that I did notice was the lack of ammo in this game and that can come back to haunt you if you save at the wrong spot and then have to square off with one of the bosses. Especially in the end where you need to pump some serious ammo into the queen to even have her change form. All in all a very addicting game and it offered up hours of enjoyment. The scenes were really good although the love triangle is a bit much, and strange incestual vibe given off between Chris and Claire can get a little wierd at times."
5,"Hey, What can I say?","This One Tops Them All The Graphics Are Great It's More Realistic, It's More Detailed Even Though The Game was Already released for dreamcast there were some scenes i never seen before which blew me away overall this is the best resident evil game i've ever played if you are a resident evil fan you must have this!!!!!!!!"
1,Can't see a d--n thing,"Maybe I'm getting old...maybe games are getting too complex for me...may the lighting in the game is so low, I couldn't play it for five minutes at any time without getting killed because I couldn't see who was attacking me or where they were attacking me from. I've heard this game is great from a lot of people, but what's the fun if you can't see ANYTHING. (Yes, I did adjust the brightness level on my TV to the highest level...to no avail.)..."
3,Why do these games have to be so HARD!,"I am a fan of easy to play RPGs. Some of my favorites are Final Fantasy X and Devil May Cry (which I almost beat, it is so easy and if you buy this game, you'll get a cool demo of it). I rented this game, the day before I saw the movie and believe me, I wasn't a big fan of it. I rented Nemesis for PSOne before I rented this, and I had troubles with that one, I like games that only have me use the left joystick, not both, because I have fingers that slip sometimes. I had problems with this in games like Max Payne (which is by far the most bloody, gory and disgusting game I have ever played. Those are the reasons which I sold mine). But I will buy this game, just to try it out, but if I mess it up again, I will be selling it!"
3,Didnt rock me like the others did,"What can I say? This title was pretty good. It is for sure a strong three, maybe a 4, but I have lost interest in the game. If I wrote this when I bought it, It would have been a 4. It looks really good, plays well, and sounds creepy. It seemed a tad short and I was left wishing for another disk like in Resident Evil 2. Rent this game and check it out. It did not dissapoint, but it didnt blow me away either."
4,Only one word for this game Awesome!,I loved this game I have played other Resident Evil games before and I thought this one is the best I have played. It took me about 2 months to beat this game and I love the challenge. The graphics were great and as all the other Resident Evil games you get to switch characters. You still get Claire and there is also Chris (her brother) but now you get Steve. If you want a good game buy this one! I purchased Resident Evil Dead Aim and I was very disappointed in it. The graphics were cool but the game was way to short. So for the money I would suggest this one.
2,Never play it ever again!,"It has great sound, graphics, and I must say the zombies are pretty stupid(but then again they always have been). The bad thing about this game is that, the puzzles oh the puzzles, they're so confusing. I've beat all of the Resident Evil games on PS1 and PS2 up to this one, and they are all challenging, but not as hard as this one. I got like thirty minutes into the game and then I had to get some metal out of a metal detector room, in real life I'd just toss it across, but NO! I have to do it a certain way, I'm sorry but I was once a master at these games but I no longer am."
1,what's with all the good reviews?,This is by far the stupidest game ever made. And its a shame because I love the resident evil series but this game is an embarassment you should rent before you buy it. Or save precious time and not play it at all
3,The worst resident evil ever!,"This game is nothing but a great deception! After one of the greatest games of the series - Resident Evil 3, this one was expected to improve the series. But with troublesome camera views, a confusing and uninteresting story, low availability of extras and upgrades that makes the player enjoy the game again and again, I sincerely do not recommend this game for fans of Resident Evil."
4,the scariest game since the last,this game is scary with a twist of cool mellow action more of a suspen thriller. you might want to check this game out before you buy it i had my doubts too you know.
5,Awesome game before and after!,"since 1996 Resident Evil has wowed every person who played it. Now, in 2002, the legacy of Resident Evil lives on. Sure, Re 1, 2, 3, and re code:veronica for the dreamcast were absolutely FABULOUS for the times that they came out,but in this recv remake, you get wowed in a different way. RECV for the ps2 takes resident Evil to a new extreme. With improved graphics, sound, and added footage, recv for the ps2 makes a mark in gaming history. Buy it,enjoy it, and even when you beat it, recv for the ps2 has amazing replay value! (but i wont tell you how!)RECV for the PS2 is a must buy for any survival horror genre game lover!"
3,Playing as Claire without a Scare,"I have always been a fan of the Resident Evil Series, but this one never had my heart pounding for a second. Violence and Gore, Yeah right! I believe this game can use some more bloody effects. Of all resident evil games I played, this one gave me the least scare of all, but it does have a good storyline. Not one scene in the entire game frighten me yet. The one other thing that upsets me is the exxagerated damage of the suvival knife. I mean, I survived without a bite from them zombies using only the knife in the first 30 minutes of the game (and I did get far). But it's fun stabbing the zombie dogs continuously until they finally fallen victim to your blade. Like all the common issues, I also had problems getting the controls too, but once use to it, it is no differcult than the other resident evil games."
2,frustrating,"I have been a fan of resident evil games for quite some time, so when I purchased my play station this is one of the first games I bought. The graphics and voice-overs dont bother me, what bothers me is the you are constantly running out of ammo, health and patience. This is the 3rd time that I have had to restart the game over to see if I could save more ammo to kill that monsters in the airplane which by the way is practically invincible. This game is extremely difficult and limited amo and health does not help matters. My recomendation is to rent the game first and don't expect it to be like the other resident evil games."
2,frustrating,"I have been a Resident Evil fan for quite some time so when I bought my PS2 this is one of the very first games that I bought.I am very dissapointed, graphics are O.K and the voice- over's don't bother me at all what bothers me is that you are constantly running out of ammo, health and patience, the game is too hard to beat, I have tried many times without any success and I am still stuck in the airplane trying to kill the big zombie dude which by the way is impossible, he never dies. This is the third time that I have started the game all over to see if I could save some more ammo and health. My recommendation is to rent the game first and see if you can handle it, and don't espect it to be like the old resident evil games."
3,fair,"I looked foreward to trying this game. I was dissappointed in the game control. Maybe I just need to play it more, but my first impresson is slow. Claire is slow, almost walloing in mud. I wish i would have rented it first. The demo disc Devil May Cry that came with, Well if the game is like the demo, all I can say is awesome."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,"My husband and I were really looking forward to playing this game and so rented it from the local video store. We were blown away by how awful this game is. We didn't even feel it was worth it to finish it and so returned it before seeing the end. The controls are some of the worst I've seen. I had an easier time with the original Mario Bros. The voice-overs were terrible, the storyline is predictable and almost identical to every other survival horror game. The game ceases to be scarey because boredom and frustration set in. You are constantly running out of ammo, out of health (if you can even find anything in the poor lighting), and out of patience. The game will keep you constantly running from one building to another to fit the pieces of the puzzle together. This is the sign of a game made without the designer using any creativity or intelligence. I don't know what Capcom was thinking, this is absolutely terrible. I wouldn't recommend this tripe to anyone."
4,Mommy the game broke.,the stupid game broke on me. one day i played the game then the next it still worked its just that well controlers didnt work anymore on that game. i was almost finished with the claire part wich was fun. i still think resident evil 2 was better overall if it had todays graphics. but this one has a kick A** storyline. to me u need the startegy guide for resident evil games. frankly there to hard well i did memorize RE2 with out using the strategy guide and i could beat it two or three times a day. i could beat it like in two hour's or so and i was only 7 year's old. rent code veronica first see if u like and get it if u do.
3,Not for bleachers,"I took this to a college football game, but found it was much too large to fit on the metal bench seating. The width was fine, but it was much too deep. I couldn't let the seat hang back into the legs of the people behind me, so I let it hang forward where it cut into my legs. The blanket was okay, but not overly plush. This would work great on the ground or in a full size patio chair, but not at the football stadium. It is a nice, very well-made sturdy case. Wish it was 2/3 the depth and lesser in price. I suppose the back wouldn't stay up then, but at least it would fit."
3,More of the same...,"I still haven't determined if I love this disc or hate it. ""Live Your Life Be Free"" delivers some crisp melodies & lyrics along with an expanded repertoire of vocal techniques & inflections. (Belinda also co-penned some of the better tunes.) But the production wavers between thunder and cheese, and the album suffers from the saccharine sameness that plagues much of Belinda's work. ""World of Love"" is wretched, but the other songs have redeeming qualities that make me wonder what they might have sounded like with better arrangements and production.Belinda's vocals still rely too heavily on girlish earnestness and breathless romanticism. She does demonstrate in ""You're Nothing Without Me"" that she can don new vocal personae; still I yearn for more variety in her singing. She sounds most convinced and convincing on ""Loneliness Game.""So how does her music keep finding its way into my head?"
5,2 good songs,"I was hoping for a lot from this artist because the ""Heaven on Earth"" single was so good. I bought 4 or 5 of her CDs and find them disappointing. They are ""OK"" but not great. The lyrics aren't real ""deep"". Alright for background music as you are driving but not much ""meat"". This is the best of the bunch however and that includes the ""Heaven on Earth"" CD. Live your Life Be Free and Half The World are excellent tunes in my opinion. The problem is that it's just my opinion and of not much use to whoever may read this. Got to make up your own mind. I got the CDs for pennies (plus $3.50 shipping) each from the Amazon Marketplace used CD sellers so my investment wasn't serious. No way in this world I'd pay full price for THESE. I'm a 50 yr. old male pop music fan so mix that in with the above opinion."
2,Important Subjects but Mediocre Rendering,"Some important subjects were alluded to pertaining to the role of women in Iranian society but a lackluster, mediocre and incomplete rendering of those subjects left this audience confused and empty. The writer & director, if they are going to tell a story, they should finish their story however they think is appropriate and not leave it up to the audience to create their own ending. This ambiguity laden story telling style is a self-righteous attempt to be clever, intelligent and complex. But instead shows a lack of direction. The acting was flat, lacking emotion and depth. The story seemed to plod through many scenes and lacked impact where many opportunities to showcase Iranian culture presented themselves."
