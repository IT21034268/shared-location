5,Gift for grad,My daughter's boyfriend is a graphic artist and very quiet. For graduation he really wanted books to add to his library for inspiration. After some sneaky work by my daughter we ordered this plus a gift card for another book. He was very excited and appreciative. Turns out this was the one book he really wanted.
1,swanson roof cutting video,after watching this video i learned the following.....There is nothing to be learned from this video other than the fact that im STUPID for having paid 4 it ur better off throwing ur money out of a moving car
3,Pupply Pad Frame,"It's ok. However, the method of attaching the bottom of the tray to the top edging is with 4 interlocking buttons on each side of the tray (4 buttons on the tray and 4 holes on the top edging which snap into place). This is fine if you have pads that dimensionally fit the tray exactly but if you have to fold the pad then it becomes more of an issue. It is also more difficult to take apart. I think it's nicer looking than the Iris tray, but after seeing the attachment method of the Iris, I think I would have chosen the Iris, just because of this issue. Also, we now use washable puppy pads which is thicker than the paper pads so, it barely snaps together now."
2,Only fair product,"My puppy is an indoor dog. This is ok for a temporary measure, but not substantial (heavy) enough to train a dog to use in the house."
1,"Holds pad in place very well, but my dog would not use them","It went to Goodwill my dog would not ever use it. The Product does a good job securing the pads in place. So I will give it four stars for that. But does the product work in the way it is intended? Not in our household, so one star overall.I don't like giving one star reviews but it was a total waste of money and training time in my household, I think that is the information you need to know. The tray and pad system may not work for your dog. Hope this helps you make your decision."
1,warped! Does not sit flat on the floor,I have bought this same tray and it was fine. This one is defective.
2,Richell Paw 94529 Trax Pet Training Tray,"The Ruichell Paw Trax Pet Training Tray for my purposes was a useless item. Overall however, the product is well made and the intent for the training tray certainly has it's merit. As far as I am concerned, the product is overpriced and over rated.The delivery was excellent and I appreciate this very much.Don't waste your money."
5,Great buy!!!!!,"This is such a great buy!!! I was wondering if I should buy this or more expensive one. This is inexpensive and does the job!!! If you are like me wondering which one to get, I highly recommend this one."
4,Great pee pad frame!,"I think this is a great pee pad frame! It fits a 17 x 24 pad perfectly. What's nice is that my puppy knows, by just that small step up/on, when she is on the frame going to the bathroom. The clip in edges prevent the pee from seeping on to the floor, saving your floors, which is great. I've been to friends' houses with dogs who don't have a frame and the dog will pee on the edge and the pad will catch half pee, the other half on the floor. This frame will solve that problem and save your floors!"
2,Good concept but...,"Anyone who's owned a puppy would know that they destroy everything! While the concept of this item is good, the potty pad gets ripped to shreds and dragged away leaving an empty tray for the pup to lie on."
3,Batten down your Pee Pee pads!,"Bought this tray for my 9 week old puppy. He used the tray instantly for both pee pee and poo; however, he scratched at the pads until he was able to tear them up. The tray is easy to use, the pads are easy to insert and the lid snaps off with ease as long as you pick it up from one side from the center snaps. Overall, this tray is a better buy and is more sanitary than the trays with grates. Grates hold solid waste within their small squares and are difficult to clean. The Paw Trax pads fit perfectly and have always held all liquid without incident. Simply roll the pad up and throw it away."
1,Not for puppies!,I got this for my puppy. It took her all of an hour to figure out how much fun it was to tear the puppy pad out and shred it all over the floor! I think this might work well for an older dog that isn't so into tearing everything up!
5,Couldn't have a puppy without it.,This product saves my floor. the puppy knows to go here if he is inside....
4,Sequoia,"This was one of my favorite books when I was a child and I searched for it on Amazon on a whim, and when I found it I ordered it for my great-grandchildren. I was pleasantly surprised to see the book I received is the identical issue, even to the pictures, that I had read so many times back then. I am so glad I didn't order the hardback copy. Memories......! The book is obviously old, printed in the 1930s, but to have lasted this long, especially as a paperback, the owner had to have taken good care of it."
5,fabulous book,"My 3-year-old is color-obsessed and my 21-month-old is shaping up to be the same. This book is beautiful and they love it. It's got everything - counting, beautiful, bright colors, seek and find - all in a sturdy format which could weather several adoring children's worth of wear."
5,This book can be used so many different ways !,"We love this book. Our little guy is only nine months but is already learning so much. We love to talk about the colors, find the different objects, and count how many we can find. His favorite page is ""blue"" and loves to find the motorcycles and robots. This is a fun book that offers alot of visual stimulation and can grow with your child as their skills becomes more advanced."
2,It's okay ...,"If you know nothing about the band then bye it, otherwise most of the content of the book is just recycled information. At times I felt like I was reading the ""Here Today, Gone To Hell"" website. I could have finished a majority of the stories myself ... kind of like taking a peek at my girlfriend's diary. Any value to be had from the book is really just the consolidation of all the various Guns N' Roses information that's out there. Nothing ground breaking here, just a collection of what's all out on the Internet. I read it once and gave it away."
1,THE BOOK THAT EVERYONE SHOULD FORGET!!!,"This book is absolute trash! It contains no new information, everything is just recycled from somthing else, from the likes of rolling stone or MTV. It has no new quotes, true but trashy gossip or anything else AT ALL!!!DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!The author is somewhat biast aswell, to everything Axl has ever said or done in the past and present.This book will also bore you to tears!"
1,Old News,"The author must have collected his information solely off of the internet and nothing else. There is nothing new in this book that any fan would not already know. Any given Guns N' Roses website would be just as informative without the ridiculous price required. The author constanly repeats himself using old quotes from the members time and time again. Perhaps his way of page filling? It is a lazy effort and best avoided by all means. Rather than waste your money, visit www.heretodaygonetohell.comor one of the many other GNR sites that will provide much more than this weak publication can offer."
1,This P.O.S. really sucks,"I am a pretty big GNR fan and am appauled that anyone found that ""book"" to be even readable. I thought it could be good untill i opened it up. Spelling mistakes, grammer mistakes, random quotes, and a chapter on ""Axl."" Axl is an upset to anyone who truely likes guns n' roses. He FORCED the rest of the band to sign over the name and he has ruined what good name they had. Now guns n' roses is just Axl McFat and the guys who aren't Slash. And for everyone that thinks Axl is guns n' roses then why hasn't chinese democracy come out yet. because when push comes to shove he can't sing, write, produce, or even buy his way out of it."
5,gnr detractors shut up!,Anyone who is a REAL fan of the band will love this book. Anyone who believes Axl is doing the right thing right now will love this book. Anyone who doesn't understand english may have trouble.
4,good Christmas video for preschoolers,"The story: Spot helps two reindeer who have lost Santa's sleigh while taking it for a test drive. With his friends' assistance, Spot finds the sleigh and is rewarded with a ride to Santa's workshop. My (almost) 2 year old loves it. It's lively without being hyperactive, and geared for little ones without being overly grating on adult nerves."
5,Spot's Magical Christmas is the best!,This is the best video in the Spot series! My three year old loves it and so does Mom and Dad! The animation and story are delightful. I look forward to bringing it out again at Christmas time. Yeah Spot!
2,The only one we don't like!,"I'm surprised at the rave reviews people have given the Spot Christmas video! We have them all - and this is the only one that my now 4-year-old son just walks away from! It's boring boring boring, in our opinion."
5,Enchanted,Based on the Spot stories by Eric Hill.Spot's Magical Christmas (1995) was an enchanted story with magnificent music and Classic Walter Disney (1901-1966) animation.Good illusrations.
4,"""Ravenswood a must for activists""","""Ravenswood"" details the fight of West Virginia steelworkers to maintain their jobs and community against a multinational employer. This book echoes the workers' voices and their struggle. Innovative tactics gave these workers tools to not only wage an effective local effort, but an impressive international one as well. This is a key for labor's revitalization and an important book for activists."
4,"""Ravenswood"" vital for union activists","Unions and communities seeking tools to control global corporate power now have a handy guidebook -- ""Ravenswood."" This excellent book details how West Virginia steelworkers waged an international effort to maintain their jobs and safe conditions. Their innovative tactics and coalition building are lessons union and community activists can use. Plus workers' voices resonate in this book, as they struggle to maintain their lives. A first class effort!"
2,"pretty shoes, not as comfortable as I expected","these shoes are pretty. Although the cut-out design leads to a pinch problem when you walk in these. I feel my toes are squeezed and sometimes the pinky toe gets stuck and pinched in the cut-out. And the leather is kind of hard and abrasive too. Had these for 2 years, didn't wear more than 3 times."
4,beautiful shoes!,"nice shoes,i got them for my sister.only one thing:size 7.5 fits like 7 and leather is a little hard,"
3,"Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love...again!","Debbie Reynolds scored one of her most popular hits playing Tammy in the original ""Tammy and the Bachelor"", but when the time came to expand the series, Universal contract starlet Sandra Dee stole many a heart with her own special Tammy magic.In TAMMY AND THE DOCTOR (1963), Sandra Dee returns as Tammy, with her object of affection (the doctor of the title) played by an up-and-coming Peter Fonda. When her elderly guardian Mrs. Annie Call (Beulah Bondi) becomes seriously ill, Tammy accompanies her interstate to a large Los Angeles hospital. As per usual, Tammy's plain-speaking ways get her into all sorts of strife; as she finds herself falling for handsome intern Mark Cheswick (Peter Fonda).A dubbed Sandra Dee also gets to recreate the original ""Tammy"" title song in this movie! Co-starring Macdonald Carey, Margaret Lindsay, Reginald Owen and Alice Pearce."
5,Good product,"This belt is good, but it's smaller than I expected that it would be.Other than that, it is as good and durable as all the other Case Logic items that I've bought.It can also double as a money belt/ wallet that fits under clothes."
5,2nd Time Around,This is the second novel in the Claire Gray Series. I really like this one better than the first book. Not to say that the first one is bad or anything. The first one is a first rate mystery novel as well. But the second one adds more depth and dimension. Read it! You'll love it as much as I do.
4,DVD Purchases,All actions required to purchase this DVD were simple and direct. Locating any DVD is easy. Great job Amazon. Buyer shipped the product on time and tracking was easy. Thanks again.
3,I hate to admit this...,"I hate to admit it, but I have watched this movie 3 times, and I am still confused. The good news is that after seeing it three times, I don't care anymore. The flashbacks and the action all bleed together so that it is difficult to tell the difference. I think this is the weakest of the Saw series, but Saw V is good, so watch it once, and then be smarter than I am in one of two ways: understand the movie or stop while you're ahead, pop in Saw V, and enjoy."
4,questions were answered,"Well I wanted to see this one before saw the fifth one, obviously. This one didn't miss a beat. Sick and twisted as you'd expect with and ending you wouldn't. Saw V is the glue to put all of them together, but still leaves room for another couple movies. I'm curious to see what happens next."
4,Really Scary,"This is the 4th one in the total scary chain, the surprising and unpredictable actions are greaaat.If you have a rock heart and like the horror movies, then YOU MUST WATCH the whole chain.Best Regards,"
2,Saw XII is REALLY going to suck,"Saw IV is the newest installment in this series. There's not much to say about this one. There were some good moments, and they used the opportunity to go into detail about what turned Jigsaw into the man he is. It was almost a sequel and prequel combined into one. The film flowed nice, even with all the flashback sequences. The problem is that they tried too hard to tie the film in with the others and made it WAY too confusing towards the end. Other than that, it's all been done. The look and feel was still there from the first films, but I think it's time to unplug the Saw and leave it alone now. Four films were enough, and maybe even more than enough. I do still love the look, feel, and creepiness of them... but let's not turn them into the next Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. We don't need Saw XII, or even Saw V for that matter."
5,Can't wait til Saw 5,"This movie is a real thinker. If you havn't paid any attention to detail in the previous three movies, you will not understand this movie. It is extemly awesome and everyone should own a copy."
4,NOT AS GREAT AS SAW 3 BUT VERY CLOSE,"First off let me say that I truly dig this movie but I had to warm up to it and let everything sink in.The movie's main strenghts lies in all the suspense felt throughout the movie and the awesome twist at the end.All the actors did a great job and the john kramer backstory was very interesting.As opposed to saw 3, this entry in the franchise did not have the emotional impact that the previous movie had because 2 main characters that are important to the story have died so all we have left are many new characters that we have no emotional connection to.this sequel unlike the last movie left far too many unaswered questions and answered very few ones which I know many die hard saw fans who follow every plot detail to a t will take issue with.To conclude,this movie is definetly worth a look because its very good but not as good as my personal favorite saw 3.SAW RULES!!!!"
5,Very Impressive,"Wow. What more can I say but wow. I can't wait for another Saw movie to come out. In all of the saw movies I've never seen the same thing done twice. This one is defently the sickest, and also has a more complicated plot, but like all saw movies, this one picks up where the third one left off. Although there is more story line to Saw 4 it left me wanting to know more, which I'm hoping the next in the series will answer these questions. In my opinion Saw 4 was probably the best out of all 4 saw movies."
4,Tobin Bell Is The New Vincent Price,"I can't wait to buy this dvd. I am now hooked on Saw and Mr. Tobin Bell. His Jigsaw character has brought new life into the Horror genre and this installment has it all. Loose ends are tied up, new questions are tossed at us, we find out even more about Jigsaw's past, and there is action, thrills, and gore galore. Saw's mixture of terror, CSI style detective drama, and action is very addictive. Tobin Bell holds it all together though. This man is a great actor and a modern day Vincent Price in my opinion. Check him out in Boogeyman 2 and Buried Alive also."
3,AS FORTH INSTALLMENTS GO..... SAW IV IS NOT BAD!,"OK, I'm a sucker for watching scumbags getting their due and 'Saw IV' delivers a very fast paced crime drama with plenty of blood and gore. The folks cranking out these movies know a couple of things that work.1)Fast pacing2)Keep the films short!3)Hire decent actorsI must admit I wasn't expecting much from a 4th installment in the series, but it did hold my interest and I found the tension pretty high. If I had one problem with the film, it would be the ending. I just wasn't too clear on what I had witnessed. I'm not saying I don't get it, but I would have liked it to be as clear as the rest of the film. I thought it was clever to do a film about events that were happening at the same time as another film in the series. So I'm not really sure if this could be considered a true sequel? If your a fan of the series, 'Saw IV' doesn't really disappoint."
2,An exercise in wheel-spinning,"The Bottom Line:A completely unnecessary film (Saw III wrapped things up pretty nicely, but the franchise is a cash cow so more keep coming) which is unbelievably transparent in its pathetic attempt to craft a continuing story out of the few loose ends that were leftover from the last installment, Saw IV could be described far better as ""desperate"" than ""scary"": the only reason to see this one is if you want to say you've seen every Saw.1.5/4"
3,Who carries the legacy?,I saw the sequels 2 through 4 in order. More blood and death. But I do like the premise and the plot. In the game follow the instructions to the letter!! Any deviation has dire consequences.
2,The Worst One yet,"I did have hopes for this one, since I loved the third one. Yet, the storyline was extremely confusing and hard-to-follow, and yet, I had seen the Saw movies at least 4 times each. They could have gone with a much more simple and effective idea if they had used the cliffhanger from the third one. Instead, they created a movie in which you simply accept what is being told (you think ""somehow, it must make some sense""). And the death scenes... well, they have reached a level that can't go more explicit, so they have to figure out what to do now.Since they're already producing Saw 5, I hope they get it right this time."
1,bad and not good at all,"Saw 1 is good, the rest really, really suck. this one was so, so, so very bad. boring violence, lame plot, and really boring characters. Oh, character development, it only took the 4th movie to get into it. Guess what? it was unnecessary and boring character development. I don't care what made Jigsaw so awesome (obviously only referring to the first movie), but he is, so stop prying. I don't need to know about his ex-chick-E-baby to know what makes him tick. What am I his girlfriend or something? He kills people for a cause, don't muddy the waters. Once you kill off a character, guess what, don't go and tell us his life story, that's just lame. while I'm at it, the girl from ""Becker"" are you serious? That is the WORST casting that I've ever seen. So, So Bad"
3,There will be blood.................,"This is a very interesting, well thought out film which held my interest all the way through. The only real problem that was hard to overlook was the very bad acting and especially bad minority actors. Otherwise quite enjoyable. Beats number three by a landslide."
1,A TOTAL TURN-OFF,"I HAVE JUS ONE THING TO SAY SKIP THIS TITLE.OR ELSE RE-VIEW IT'S PRECCEDORS (SAW 1,2,3) AGAIN .IT'S A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY AS WELL , THE END AGAIN IS NOT TO MUCH SHOCK .....IT'S ONE OF THE DETECTIVES WHO TURN OUT TO BE THE HIER'S OR HELPER OF JOHN FRAMER -THAT'S THE SUSPENSE .....IT'S JUST A SHEER WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY...."
1,No 1/2 stars available,"Sorry but true. Big fan of ALL 3, this was the death of the Saw franchise. Too bad they don't have the option of 1/2 star, cause that's what it gets. GAME OVER."
2,"Just like the other Saws, only...","Saw IV is just like the other Saw movies, only, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. Even Saw III came together at the end, just barely; not Saw IV. Here it is: Costas Mandylor did it. For no particular reason than he was in one of the earlier Saw movies. That's it. Now I've saved you the time. Aren't you glad you read my review? There's NOTHING about Saw IV that is better, or even as good as, the other Saw movies, which I think were pretty spectacular in a horrifyingly creepy, awful way. Let the series die, please. I don't want to play a game anymore."
2,jigsaws game is getting pretty boring and repetive,"Iam getting board of seeing the samething over and over again they could'nt at least put something more in this movie. When i saw part3 that was a let down but when i saw this i was not really impreesed your just seeing the samething someone being tourtured and kidnaped, the saw movies were quet the same, but this saw movie i did'nt really care for."
3,love Jigsaw,"Forgiveness is the basis of the 'games' in SAW III. Also important is the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda. The 'games' of jigsaw tend to be more emotional, whereas Amanda's game are unwinnable. I suppose I am one of the few people who doesn't think that this installment is the best of the SAW series, but it is certainly an enjoyable movie. The 'traps' were good and the twist was interesting. The 'traps' in this film, I find, to be no more disturbing than those from the previous two, although they seem to affect the entire body as opposed to only a portion."
1,MOST AWFUL SAW OF THEM ALL!,"Let me start off by saying I REALLY LIKED the first three SAWS. This SAW was really, really, really bad. Jumbled plot, bad acting, and really you don't care about ANY of the characters in this DUMB movie!.. DO NOT rent, buy, this movie REALLY SUCKS!! Hopefully this is the end of this series. I will not even bother looking at SAW V if it ever comes out!"
2,"Good movie, damaged Blu Ray","I purchased this item over Amazon a phew weeks ago. I was not able to try it until today. I was looking forward to watching it, but it turned out the Blu Ray was damages and was not read by 3 Blu Ray Players and 2 PS3 systems. The movie itself is good though, have seen it like 2 times."
3,Too many characters ruined it for me!,"I love the Saw movies, so I couldn't wait until this was released. I have watch the other 3 many times, I was so sure I'd love this too. The time frame and traps in the movie were great. I loved the fact that we got to meet Jill and learn more of John's background. However, too many charcters that look the same when they are not covered in blood, made it so hard to figure out who was who and which way was up. I liked the ending because I feel that the last guy standing needs testing because he was the one rigging the traps so they were impossible to win. I'll keep watching until they quit making, but this one wasn't near as good as the 1st 3."
5,Movie review,Saw IV was good and very bloody and that is just the type of movie I like. Ultimate horror fans dream with all of the blood. I really liked this movie and would recommend this movie.
4,Red White and Blue - The Best of John Philip Sousa,I bought this as a gift for my father. He loves music and really enjoys marchs and band music. He will be able to listen to this and feel uplifted.
2,Make sure you check your order.,"I ordered this item from Amazon but got a different gear oil. Needed a GL-4 got a GL-5. Would have reeked havoc in my Spec-V tranny. I returned it without an issue but need to re-order the correct gear oil. Should I order from Amazon again, I probably will."
5,It's an MTF. And it works. What more do you want?,"I've got an '03 RSX Type S with 200k miles with the original transmission and it's a bit notchy. In cold weather, it virtually locks up completely and it's difficult to shift gears. After having ZERO success with GM Synchromesh and Amsoil Synchromesh, I tried Redline MTL and it's like I've got a new transmission. While it's still a bit difficult to get into gear when the temperatures are very cold (<10 degrees F) outside, the Redline really does make a huge difference. When the weather warms up to >20 degrees, the car shifts like butter. This really is the best fluid out there for my car and it's pretty much the same price as most other fluids that just don't work. Great stuff."
5,A nice story,"I had never heard this legend before I found this book at the library. I was glad I read it. The story is nice and the pictures are great! ( kind of gory). This an easy read, and a cute book."
3,Neat book--but not necessarily for kids,"This is fun story, and the pictures are wonderfully done,and appropriately loathely! The story may be a little sophisticated forkids."
3,Yay for Gawain!,"What a lovely story of Gawain's chivalry! And to go along with it, beautiful illustrations. what more could I ask for?"
5,A guide for everyday,This is another book recommend by my pastor as he instructs us on the book of Job. I find it an interesting companion to my bible and will continue to refer to it everyday as I study God's word.
5,Oswald Chambers,I have always enjoyed Oswald Chambers books and this is complete teaching of all his books. There are scripture references to support all of his sermons. It's a cherished possession now.EA
4,Every Book of Chambers,"This is an exhaustive work. It includes a CD and every book of Oswald Chambers. Chambers is a mix of John Wesley and A.W. Tozer. His theology seems similar to the old-time Methodists. Some of his insights into the self-life are dead on, especially his views on worry and self-pity. One of the most memorable (and to some controversial) quotes from Chambers is ""the only right a Christian has,is to give up all his rights."" He focuses a lot on a Christian denying his right to self. The only drawbacks of this work is Chambers has a tendency to be too mystical in his interpretation of Scripture, and he over reaches in his exegesis of the biblical text. Still this is worth while reading,with many interesting points."
5,Works great. Set it up and forget about it.,I purchased a used Battery SaverPlus for $20 and hooked it up to a battery pack on an electric start Toro lawnmower. After only 4 hours the battery was at full charge. It's working great and it's nice to have the red light that blinks when it's charging. I'll probably end up using it to keep my diesel generator start-up battery charged up this winter. I can run my whole house with my solar array and it's good to have peace of mind by having small devices like the Battery SaverPlus for lawnmowers and generators. Solar is the way to go.
3,Panel Works Like It Should,"Solar trickle charger works fine. However, ICP DOES NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE PRODUCT SUPPORT on its website. Therefore, if you buy this item, you're on your own!"
1,"Great anime, horrible version","Twelve kingdoms is a great anime that enhances any collection, however this DVD set was a severe disappointment in quality. The subtitled dialog often flashed on and off before you could recognize it had appeared on screen, much less read it. The video also became unclear and jumped in places. In short, it's a very cheaply made, poor quality version.I would recommend that anyone considering purchasing this title look atThe Twelve Kingdoms Collection One/The Twelve Kingdoms Collection Twoor the Premium sets. I will, unfortunately, be biting the bullet and repurchasing a higher quality version."
3,An epic tale.,"I wanted to love this series, but it fell flat for me.Researching the terms used in this series is a big helper before you even start watching. The main characters have interesting backgrounds and most of them seem to develop nicely as the story progresses, but I failed to become attached to any of them. The English dub is very well done; I haven't yet experienced it with the original Japanese voice acting. The character designs definitely are not my style. I understand that main protagonist is supposed to start as an average girl, but the design just doesn't appeal to me. The animation looks pretty good, and the grandiose world is well presented.I'm going to give it another watch with subtitles at some point. Maybe it'll do something to create the magic I felt was missing. So, take my review with a grain of salt until I make an edit with a second run through. :)"
2,The PC Biography of US Grant,"This book seems to have been intended for high school readers, if there are still any interested in studying the history of the Civil War. It manages, despite the books' length and focus, to be superficial. The language is often awkward and trite. The author never lets a chance to get in some ""politically correct"" dig at things like slavery to escape his text, and manages to discuss these issues in a way that sounds more like a sermon from the front of a 10th grade class than a serious biography.Like other readers, I was dismayed at the poor writing and editing of this book from a major publisher. How did it get those gushing reviews from professional reviewers?Grant himself wrote beautifully; his two-volume Memoirs are still delicious, if you can find a set. And Horace Porter's Campaigning With Grant is another delightful read, direct from someone who watched Grant in action."
1,Unfair to Ulysses says Julia Dent,I had my friend read this book aloud to me and I was chagrined at how little the author knew about Ulysses. There were mnany factual gaffes and he gets the General's marriage all wrong. It was most vexing for me to read this tripe.
1,Disappointed,"As a Grant admirer who has read McFeely's prize-winning and somewhat critical biography and Grant's own Memoirs, I was eagerly looking forward to Perret's book. I could not finish it (and my reactions should be taken accordingly-maybe my complaints would have vanished in the last half). I will describe my reaction because I do not see here any other similar one. I felt the book repeatedly presented its material with a gratuitous snide spin, what seemed to me to be a sophomoric effort to be clever at the expense of the subject that seems entirely out of place in such a book. One example appears on page 45 (hardcover): While courting Julia Dent, Grant heard a rumor that there was a dangerous rival for her affections. Perret reports that the crisis passed because there was no rival. ""If there were any other serious suitors for Julia Dent's plump little hand, no record of them survives."""
4,Like Good Whiskey.....,"Oh my GOD! It's all wrong! The book stinks! Bla, Bla, Bla, Bla Bla! Hey, lets all hunt down the author and tell him how dumb he is and how smart we all are! Are you an Ulysses Sam Grant fan? Spend the 13 bucks and get it. Let's put it this way, it won't actually hurt you. You may actually like it. Ya, ""it's not that bad"" Even if the fellow critics find it hard to swallow.......like good whiskey."
3,Good book for the novice Grant scholar,"After reading Last Full Measure, I sought more information on General Grant and happened upon this book. I found the book fascinating in parts, but a bit dull in others. The author certainly likes Grant and treats him well, but he also gives deference to other authors who held less favorable opinions. The Battle of Shiloh is particularly good, as well as the account of Grant's life after the war -- an era which gets little notice in most history classes."
1,Incompetent Treatment,"Having studied Ulysses S. Grant since High School I think I know him pretty well. This author does not know Grant. He makes too many mistakes to be taken seriously by people who know about Grant as a military man and as a soldier. I got so sick of the errors I actually tossed the book aside in disgust several times. But I did finally finish it. There's nothing new in this book that already hasn't appeared in abler studies by Bruce Catton and William McFeely. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, it is unreliable and the research here just isn't new, interesting or even accurate!"
1,Abysmal,"I have studied Ulysses Grant for 41 years and have amassed a library of 400 volumes that are a biographical studies of him. This book is at the bottom of the barrel. It is poorly researched and inept in it conclusions. Spare yourself the price of this book and read Bruce Catton instead. He got Grant on the mark, Perret misses completely."
2,Is this the real Grant? No.,"As a supporter of General Grant as a military figure in American history, I don't recommend this book. If Grant himself read this book, he would not recognize himself. Sherman also would not see Grant in these pages. Sherman would spit out his whiskey, throw down his cigar in disgust and say, ""This is not Grant!"" The author's purpose is to try and elevate Grant to the level of Lee. As a man, Grant was probably more moral and ""pure"" than Lee, but Grant had so many pockmarks on his resume, mostly due to his excessive drinking early in his career. Grant learned to control his appetite, but this struggle is not explored. My amazement is that such a lightly researched and spotty biography found a major house to publish it and enough readers to warrant a paperback version. It's better to read Jeff Shara's new civil war novel, which has more peeks into Grant's real personality than this book."
1,The worst Grant book of all,"This is a terrible book, full of mistakes of the most elemental types. The author hasn't got a clue about the real Ulysses S. Grant and it shows throughout this limping entry into the Grant field. This book is regarded as a fatuous joke among those who follow Grant's life. My advice is to avoid it like the plague."
1,Feel Cheated,"Since, I love history I am always on the prowl for a good biography about someone who intrigues me. A couple of years ago, while studying the Civil War, I became curious about Ulysses Grant. I grabbed the first book I found on the shelf and bought it.Perret's biography is written in an appealing style and I was satisfied. Satisfied until I began to read on the General in earnest. Little by little I began to recognize the errors both large and small in both fact and interpretation in the Perret biography.Now I feel cheated and a little angry. In my opinion, the author just writes books on anyone who catches his fancy, does some cursory research and sells it to an unwary public. Too bad. I won't buy another as I cannot trust his credibility."
2,Very Disappointing,"I'm a huge George Harrison fan, but I did not enjoy this album at all. Most of the songs did not sound very good with other people singing them, and the arrangements were horrible.It sounded like there were too many musicians playing different off-tempo parts all at once. Many of the songs seemed to just plod on with overused female backup singers attempting to hold things together. What a mess.Get Harrison's real albums to hear these songs done right. I did give this two stars just because there was some salvation here in the fact the Harrison did write great songs."
2,A disappointment,"Frankly, the songs just don't sound right without George's voice. I was shocked at how bad Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty sang. They ruined this CD for me. (You don't notice it as much on the DVD version). I'll be copying Eric Clapton's ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" and Clapton and McCartney's ""Something,"" and then selling it."
1,Pure JUNK!,"I saw an advertisement for this on television and decided to look into it. What a complete waste of time. Nothing but second-rate 'note for note' covers. Hey! I'm a Beatles freak but, this is trash! I was given a CDr of this and threw it in the garbage!George's worse solo album is better than this travesty! Do yourself a favor and run away from this as fast as you can!"
4,Fantastic Tribute,"After watching the DVD, I immediately looked to purchase the audio soundtrack. I was dismayed to find that ""Horse to Water"" was not included---the reason I give it only four stars. Leaving this track off has got to be one of the worst decisions ever made. Not only is it a great song, the performance is absolutely compelling. If you can only purchase one-get the DVD which includes this cut.Other than this monumental error, the concert itself truly captures the spirit that was George. Hats off to EC and George's family for putting together a moving and lasting tribute."
4,Not Complete,"I can't possibly add more to the other reviewers expressing love and admiration of George Harrison and his music. The concert was great with all of the guest musicians doing a simply fantastic job. You could feel the love for George. I would recommend you buy the complete DVD version of the concert rather than the CD. Not only is the music mixed better (in my opinion), but there is a huge omission on the CD. Jools Holland & Sam Brown! They did ""Lead a Horse to Water"" and Sam stole the show. The CD is not complete without it!"
4,RINGO SONGS,"I REALLY DONT THINK ANOTHER REVIEW IS NECCESARY.i just wanted to say why ringo played the songs he played is probably because he co-wrote ""photograph"" with george and of course george plays guitar on ""honey don't"" with ringo singing on the beatles '65 album.most of you probably know this but some people in their reviews were wondering why ringo chose these two songs to play on the album.george also played ""honey don't"" with carl perkins on carl's concert tribute album."
4,"GOOD BUT WHERE'S DYLAN, ELTON, MICK...?","sure it's damn good...eric did a good job, i really like the fact that ""while my guitar gently weeps"" is treated like on the white album with paul on the backup harmonies and the fuzz bass, same for ""something"", ringo plays the drums track part he played on abbey road and that's really moving.also the choice of the songs, god!!! why don't they choose some more obscure songs? always the same bloody ones, good but a bit boring!i would have like to hear ""mystical one"", ""blow away"", it seems like we're better fans that these ones!indeed it's a great record, thanks eric, you're the man...it's like the bangledesh!"
3,concert for george harrison,THIS IS A VERY NICE TRIBUTE TO GEORGE THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM. THE DVD IS OK I LIKE THE CD BETER
4,Beautiful,"I feel obligated to respond to a prior review - the Shankars are two of the great musicians in the world. Maybe the ""average"" person (whatever that means) doesn't care for Indian music, but as fans of George Harrison I would hope that you would emulate his example of an open mind and try to find what is so beautiful in this music.As my brother said when watching the DVD, ""Tom Petty is going to crawl back into his coffin after the show."" He sounds a bit out of sorts. Also, Ringo's numbers are not very good. But Eric Clapton sings and plays his heart out, Paul is wonderful, and so are George's songs. The uke tune at the end, ""I'll See You In My Dreams"" is gorgeous.God bless Eric Clapton for doing this."
4,Concert For George and us,"Concert for George was well done by all his friends through the years and all the recording they did together. Eric Clapton and Jeff Lynne are the best to cover George Harrison songs. I like when the songs are done note for note. You get to here all of George's great Guitar and slide style. George's song Horse to Water was done so well by Sam Brown, she did rock on that one but wasn't on the cd. Why, it would be good to have every song on the cd. George Harrison had so many great songs this is only a hand full. Billy Preston has played with George since The Beatles days on Get back and other songs, Clapton, Lynne, McCartney, Brown, Preston, Star, Petty and of course Dhani Harrison and the band did such at great job reliving George's songs again."
5,Brilliant...George Harrison can now R.I.P,"After hearing about this concert, I was shocked- I could only wish I was there. When yesterday came around, I drove to my local Borders, which only had the CD, not the DVD :-( Nevertheless, I picked up this CD and I definitely do NOT regret it- it's absolutely beautiful. You can just feel that George was there in spirit- every performance has a touch of him. My personal favorite cuts are ""I Want to Tell You,"" ""If I needed Someone,"" ""Here Comes the Sun,"" ""I Need You"" (Petty is incredible), ""Handle With Care"" (Mike Campbell from the Heartbreakers plays a VERY George-esque solo), ""Something"" (Paul plays a ukelele inspired first part before Eric takes charge in the middle), and ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps."" Being an avid Eric Clapton fan, I was not surprised how well Eric plays and how great his voice sounds, but I think he really makes the record. George can now rest in peace- I hope to meet you one day, George."
4,Don't miss it!,"Tremendous songs performed by an equally tremendous ""band"". Considering how many performers were on stage, it is unbelievable how tight they were. These guys are incredible pros, who were very very well prepared. ""Something"", and ""WMGGW"" are absolutely incredible. No clunkers, but vocals on ""Wah Wah"" are a bit lacking, and while there was nothing wrong with ""All Things Must Pass"", it was just ""OK"" (Sorry Sir P.). DVD is even better.With the enormous quality, quantity and diversity of talent on the stage, I wish they tackled ""Within You Without You"", but I guess you can't have everyhting.NOTE TO AMAZON: GET MORE REPRESENTATIVE MUSIC SAMPLES, YOU DID NOT MAKE THE BEST CHOICES, BY A LONG SHOT!!"
4,Tribute to George,Disc 2 is a fabulous collection of music by artists paying tribue to the music of George. It is wonderful music-I would recommend it to anyone who loves the Beatles work and the music that George loved.
5,This one is great,"The best thing about this DVD, aside from the great music, is that it is obvious that everyone is having a great time on stage. There is so much good about it, you just really have to see and hear it for yourself."
5,Get this CD now,"I just finished watching Concert for George on PBS. First time I've seen it. You gotta have this CD and probably also the DVD. The music was exceptional. So many great songs. Wah Wah, Isn't it a Pity, Something, All Things Must Pass. I can't wait to get it and have it blast from my stereo.It's easy to forget the impact George had. It's been so long since I first heard his music. Music is different now. Not nearly as moving. The Concert for George brought it all back for me. It will for you too."
5,Peace and Comfort,"I bought this for my Mother, a devout Christian now being tested with illness at the end of her life. Being blind and recently being diagnosed with Alzheimers, I look for anything that will bring her peace and comfort during these troubling times. I've found she can no longer listen to TV as she confuses it with reality. So I started buying her the music she's loved all of her life and it has really been a blessing for both of us. She can be highly agitated and I'll put on this CD and before you know it her agitation is gone and she's singing along with the group. I just wish it had about 40 songs as I have to play it over and over several times for her. Now I find myself singing along with the songs. I've now purchased her a couple of other CD by The Cathedrals and we love them all."
3,Don't know how to use it,"I can see the saliva through the microscope clearly, but I can't see anything as shown on the instruction. Maybe I don't know how to use it... So, I give it 3 star. The ovulation test strips are more helpful."
2,Don't clear enough,"I read the reviews on Amazon and bought it because of the price. Comparably speaking with other accurate ways of discerning your ovulation days seems like a good deal. You might want to try, but my feeling is that if you're really serious about getting pregnant and you're over 35 it's better to pay for accuracy and understanding. An easy read that help you to find the right timming. I tried it for 3 months and barely saw a difference, so to me this is not clear."
4,seems fine,"Like a couple of the reviewers, I saw a ferning pattern the day after my period. However, I'm sure that was because I did the test in the late morning, after drinking water and coffee. The instructions say that drinking anything and not doing the test first thing in the morning will affect the results. Since then, I only do the test when I first wake up, and I get accurate results. My only complaint is that the light works intermittently, but it does work, and it's very easy to read.Edited to add that I contacted them about the problem with the light and they immediately shipped me a new one. They were very pleasant and easy to communicate with. Now it works great, and I'm getting accurate readings."
4,Avoiding Pregnancy,"I'm currently using this to help avoid pregnancy, and determine if I ovulate at all. I only get a period a few times a year and when I do it's highly irregular, no ""cycle"" for me whatsoever. All my hormone levels are normal, but for whatever reason it would appear I don't ovulate. It's a pain to try and guess when and if I'm fertile, and I would recommend this over those disposable stick things. It's really easy to use and see the results. You're actually looking at the cells in your saliva, not a couple of lines on a stick."
3,Meh,It doesn't specify how much spit to put on it. I think twice I was able to guess the right amount. Waste of money for me :(
4,we using this,this product is good but im not so good looking in a microscope thats why it so hard for me to interpret the result...
1,Did not work for me.,According to this little gadget I do not ovulate. I've been using it for almost 3 months and not a single fern pattern. Thankfully I bought it on eBay for $10. Don't waist your time or money!
1,"Positive OPKs, Completely Negative Ferning","I have been using the Ovulite going on 5 months now. Not once has it shown me partial ferning or full ferning leading up to ovulation or during it. Even though I have had temperature shifts while BBT'ing, cervical mucus changes, and positive OPKs, and High/Peak readings on my Clearblue Easy Fertility monitor(high reading signifies estrogen surge, peak reading: LH surge). I have followed the directions very closely and still no ferning. Maybe I am just one of the few it doesn't work for, but it was certianly a waste of money for me."
3,It's Ok.,"Product is good, however it's a little bit short in the directions. It only shows three different kinds of views when they explain what you see on the scope. My wife and I watched different patterns. It should be more specific on the things that you see throught the lens. More examples."
1,Waste of money,"I tried this over a few cycles, following the directions religiously, and it never gave clear or accurate readings (I was also taking my temp to determine ovulation as well).The only good thing about Ovulite is the price. At least it was inexpensive enough to be worth a trial. But, in the end, I guess I spent close to $40 (with shipping costs) on a piece of junk.""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" is money well spent - use your cash for that. If it wasn't for that book, I wouldn't be expecting in 2 weeks."
3,Secondary test,"The microscope does what it claims in that you will see a pattern of ferning. However, I found that its more ""fun"" and not a great primary test for your fertile times. One cycle I had a full 10 days of ferning prior to a positive on a ovulation test. I used the product faithfully for 3 cycles and decided it wasn't worth the extra time especially at 5 am.Also I found I had to wait much longer then the instructions indicate for the sample to be dry. So if you need a back-up or other test this is fine, but I prefer temping in conjunction with pee tests as I have personally had better results with that combination."
5,This thing does actually work!!!,Needs some getting used to - but give it a chance: It actually works. I'm now almost five months pregnant. Great little invention!!
1,Did not work for me,"The Ovulite did not work for me at all. I used it first thing in the morning before brushing my teeth or drinking, but it never showed any ferning, even though OPK pee sticks showed that I was at my peak. I was using this faithfully for over 2 months, with no result."
5,SO very happy we are pregnant,"My husband and i have tried to get pregnant for 5 years and we got this little thing last month and we are pregnant we are due Oct 10 2011, we are so happy it was so easy to do. i did what it said every morning and waited when we saw the fern pattern we made love, ANd now we are pregnant for the first time in 5 years we have told every one we know that is tring to get pregnant about thing. my sister was told she would most liky never get pregnant she she got this the same time as i did and she is also pregnant we are 2 days apart."
2,Didn't work well for me,"I tried this for two cycles and never got clear results. I followed their directions exactly, and found getting a sufficient amount of saliva to see in the window was messy (less and I didn't see much at all). I could see changes throughout my cycle (tracked with BBT/CM and OPK), but the ""ferning"" wasn't clearly defined as they show and the ""peak"" lasted for about a week without being able to nail down ovulation more specifically. Although I found charting/OPK's to be more clear, if you want to try a saliva test I'd try and find one where it's got more than one sample thing so you can compare your own changes rather than trying to use the example picture."
2,Not happy,"Like Li, I too saw the dominant ferning pattern on my last day of my period and mailed Cust Service. This was their response.""There will be various degrees of ferning at different points in the cycle due to natural hormonal fluctuation; however, there should be only one instance of strong ferning that dominates the viewing region - just prior to ovulation. ""I did check with my OB/GYN and she mentioned that if one is regular (3 to 5 weeks cycle)with their periods, they ovulate in the mid of their cycle. If you have a 28 day cycle, it usually happens on day 14 from the first day of your period.I don't think I can completely trust this product."
1,Waste of time,"If I had believed the results of this peice of junk I would have believed that I do not ovulate. Everyday I diligently viewed my spit only to be disappointed. I finally gave up on this junk and just went by the calendar method and timed my ovulation correctly and I am now 13 weeks pregnant, no thanks to this peice of junk!"
1,Worst ovulation kit ever!,"The ovulation kit was hard to determine when I was ovulating. Everytime I use the kit, it said I was not ovulating. How can I not be ovulating all 30 days in a month?"
4,Great guide for first time Lab owners,"I read this book knowing very little about the breed. We recently adopted an older chocolate lab, and needed information on how to care for her. This book was just the ticket! I recommend this book for general info about the breed, or for specific info on caring for your lab."
3,Laptop,"Runs verrrrrrrrrryyyyyy sloooooooooowwwwwwwwly. This may be due mostly to the Windows Vista OS but it is hard to tell. I might try this computer again, but I would NEVER buy a Vista OS again!"
3,Could be better - 3 1/2 stars,"I Quote from the first review: ""...I mean come on, you don't see Helloween making Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt.3 (if they did they should be ashamed to no end), do you? Yeash...""oh well, they did it ;) and they are Helloween.Rhapsody is known by the incredible amount of orchestration that they use for their albums, exceding the limit (in my opinion) in this last album. although Power of the Dragon Flame ab-used as well of it, it wasn't in such a dregree as in this album.I think Rhapsody should consider to go back to albums as heavy as Dawn of Victory, and please don't jump to my neck yet, I'm not saying that is album is bad, it's just to excesive. But they decided to go for a more pompous version of themselves, well their music is even called ""Film Score Metal""... (??)I would have liked something different, but let's see what can they do in live, I'm quite interested, as the last time I saw them it was a disastrous show.Just to let you know, I'm a Rhapsody huge fan!"
5,Glacial Lake Missoula,"Outstanding book. Well illustrated. This is a great book for Western Montana, Northern Idaho, and Eastern Washington readers. There are so many places that evidence can be personally observed after reading this book."
4,Start your research here and come back to it often...,"If the idea of catastrophic glacial floods and their still-visible effects on vast reaches of Eastern Washington's geology and topography fascinates you, I haven't found a better book for building a perspective of the whole process.This is particularly true if you are not a trained geologist: Mr. Alt lays a foundation that illustrates the conditions that led to the mega-floods, then follows the evidence that the floodwaters left upon various watercourses on their way to the ocean.Mr. Alt presents it all in terms a layperson can understand and use in exploring a series of disasters writ large upon the land."
2,Broken in 2 months,"I bought this cup as a christmas present for my husband and he really loved it, the design is really nice, but he only used it for one month and the orange paint on the helmet started to peel off, then a couple weeks later then entire emblem split right in half. Very disappointed with this item considering it is an official NFL mug and when I bought it it was over $30."
1,The cup leaks,I bought this item for my husband because he is an AVID Bengals fan. The cup leaks and he doesn't use it. It would cost more to return it for a new one than the cup is worth. Disappointing because I love the design of the city on the cup. :o(
3,only ok,"This plotline in this book could have been worked out a little better. It seemed to swerve all over the place, and information tended to be repeated more than once.The author claimed objectivity, and in most cases did not criticize the people he was writing about. However, I sensed an underlying tone of disrespect for homosexuals.There was alot of information presented, and it was obvious that a great deal of research had been conducted."
4,The Velvet Underground,"The book explains the beginnings on the national craze for unrestrained sexual expression, due to the birth control liberation of women in the 1960'sHad the internet been in vogue when the book was written the whole volumn would be pertinate today."
1,Only the title is memorable,"Had Lou Reed and John Cale not seen a copy of this book in a New York City gutter (fittingly) and decided to use its name for their group, this little volume would have been justly forgotten.Written in a style which titilates while decrying the scene it describes, it's a piece of blue-nosed junk.Listen to Velvet Underground music and forget this silliness."
2,Doors live stuff,"Im an old California guy who grew up with the Doors music , and along with Beach Boys & Beatles , were my favorites of that time .This ""backstage cd has but 1 actual ""song"" which is found on alotta other disc's ..... it is actually mainly talk , tuning , practice / rehearsal time before they did a set in LA somewhere . I know the cd title is""the private rehearsal"" ... but I had just expected more actual start to finish songs , and not quite so much talking . Kevin Garder"
1,The Doors Don't deliver,"Sadly, this rather expensive 2 CD set is a severe disappointment. It is more of an instrument tune-up session rather than a work of musical substance. Don't waste your money on this one !! If it were possible to give less than zero stars this one deserves a negative 5 ...."
1,vacuum is doa,"problems right out of the box.the light works and the attachment as well.the main unit doesn't pick anything up.called service center, all closed on weekends!! despite a note saying a customer service center is 24 hours 7days. turned out to be a sales center to take more money.take the dust cartride out and you will get grease on your hands.vacuum does not pick up dirt and brushes did not rotate. something must be misaligned or stuck or just plain broken. the attatchment worked fine and rotated but not the main unit. is this one a bad unit? i couldn't find any specific info on the website. very generic questions catering to buying the product found but using the product? setup help? nope. this really is dissappointing. i'm returning it today."
1,Worst vacuum I've ever bought,"Have purchased about 7 vacuums. This was my third Hoover and wish I would have saved my money & bought the Oreck or Dyson. Have only had this about year and suction has dropped off, smells like rubber is burning & is very heavy. Took it to shop but could find nothing wrong. He told us to look around and see how many of the Hoover bagless he has to repair in his shop..there were a lot.I was discussing this with my son's wife and she said she has the same problems. She is going out today to look at other vacuums. For the price, get a Dyson or Oreck. Hoover has got to start making a much better vacuum..they have been living on their name for too long."
1,The worst vaccum I ever owned !!!,This is with no doubt the worst vaccum out there. It doesn't put up the attachements don't work. And when you empty the dirt cup you get grease on your hands. Taking it back. This vaccum need alot of improving!!
2,Costly repairs,"I bought this vacuum cleaner as it was advertised as beltless.. This was really neat as long as the warranty lasted.. Two months after my warranty( 1 year) expired, the brushes stopped spinning. I took it in for repair.. and the bill :-1)$70 for a gearbox ( the wonderful technology behind beltless)2)$40 for labor....Total without taxes :- $110.. Isn't that wonderful!!!So, in short, this is a great vacuum till it breaks down."
1,Maybe mine's faulty,"Maybe I should have mine adjusted. I came online to look again to see what people thought of this vacuum. I bought it from Amazon (no complaints there!) a few weeks ago. The darn thing won't pick up Cheerios, on either carpet or floor. It mashes raisins into the floor. I have a toddler (if that isn't obvious) and my old Hoover Windtunnel had no problem at all with any of those things. I miss the dirt indicator light but I'll probably get over that. I have wood floors and short pile area rugs. If the vacuum is on the lowest setting (which it should be) I can't move it. If I raise it up to the medium setting, it doesn't pick anything up. I hate it!"
3,XP Only...,"This book is good for small projects and small teams, or for using the techniques found in it for module level analysis. The author attempts to apply his thoughts to large projects, but they would be extremely hard to apply or pull off. He has some great thoughts on how to absorb domain knowledge, but goes over board bashing the Unified Process and other proven techniques. He isn't coming up with anything new, but he does do an excellent job of creating a book. It is very well organized. BTW, if I thought that XP could be pulled off anywhere in the world, with any group of programmers, this book would get a 10+ rating. I think XP works but only in very specific environments. Most environments do not allow for an enterprise level effort of XP."
5,Timeless classic on software design,"This book is one the few I have been reading and re-reading since it was published back in 2004. Unlike XP and Agile titles which describe the Bleeding Obvious in numerous tomes, Domain-driven design takes a deep dive into stuff that makes designing and writing software a rewarding experience: understanding the technical problem at hand and then finding an optimal solution.Too many technical books are written for people who should not be writing software in the first place. This one was written for enthusiasts and professionals alike.Note to publisher: an electronic version would be nice-to-have."
3,"Useful principles, but very difficult to get through","This book has a lot of useful design principles, but they can be hard to garner and retain because the writing is very dry. I almost wish the suggestions were of lower quality, so that I would have had an excuse to stop reading the book. In the end, it took 2 renewals from my library to get through Domain Driven Design.The other downside to the book is that it did not provide a clear path for me to incorporate many of the practices that it lays out. It seems like one would need an extremely high functioning and close knit team and organization to implement the suggestions in the book, and it's unclear to me how much one could do without such an ideal situation. While I can apply many of the specific design principles to my own tasks, I do not know how to leverage the larger practices of domain driven design in my organization."
3,"Repetitive and too long, but a must.","Have to admit right from the start, i'm just about 1/3 through.However, what I've seen so far is:1) Lots of reiterations of previously made points.2) Failing to engage - you will need all the concentration you can muster, which combined with (1) is constantly frustrating.3) As strange as it may sound - quite Java-oriented. Others may argue with that, but in lots of other environments it's just not going to be practical.As someone pointed out in Fowler's Enterprise Patterns review, frameworks place restrictions on what patterns you can use or penalize (time-wise) if you force your way. And this book is about the process and the patterns.Revised:I've had time to see for myself how little some experienced developers, architects and business analysts value the domain modelling and the development process.The writing of the book might be imperfect but the material is essential."
5,Excellent book,"If your process for writing an application is to start with the database, or to start designing UI, you should read this book.There is nothing new in this book -- but you really should read it.This book details the way many architects and analysts have been creating their applications for years, and for good reason. They start by creating domain classes that help represent data in a way that is understandable to both developer and customer. Then building out the application from there.Read this book."
3,"Good, but not what I'd hoped","I had high hopes when buying this book. After reading a lot about domain driven design and its concepts on the web, I was hoping the book would help teach me how to implement the concepts. After reading the book, I haven't learned much more than what I already knew from reading about it on the web. The book is a little wordy and would have been better as a short read. There weren't enough code examples to really teach you how to do it. If you're already practicing good design techniques, this book doesn't add a whole lot to your repertoire. If it would have been half the size and half the price I would have been happier."
4,Perfect content - but too long for many readers,"In Domain-Driven Design, Evans describes a set of patterns that capture exactly what both MDA and AOP attempts to be a solution to. Evans approach is elegant, yet realistic. Unlike other model-focused approaches, he has a good focus on lessons learned from agile software development like extreme programming, and explains how domain modeling fits in with testing-driven development, iterative and incremental development, and refactoring.I have one big gripe with this book, however. It is too long. Everything in the book is useful to me, but I would like to see more people read the parts of the book that are relevant to them. If the book had a thinner companion version or a reading guide for people who were in a hurry in the introduction it would be perfect. As it is, I cannot recommend it to ""coders"" or business analysts, only to software architects and modelers."
5,Great laptop!,I purchased this laptop about 6 months ago and it has been awesome! I have been very happy with the performance and the battery life. Fortunately I have not had any problems with it as some of the other comments mentioned.
1,Very bad,"Much like the other people reviewing here I had problems with the harddrive. Well my GF did since I bought this laptop for her. At first it made a lot of clicking sounds. Really annoying. Then it went dead. Bought it from compusa and took it back. They gave me another one. Same crap. The dvd burner did not work in either of them as well. Same problem in both. They should do a recal and give people their money back. Very poor for such a high rated company. I have a Sony FS now, and it gives kind of the same clicking sounds every few min. Never had this problem or noise with any other laptop besides sony. By far the best laptops made in my opinion are HP. Shame on you Sony for putting crappy harddrives in your laptops."
2,NOT IN COLOR!,"Many reviewers have stated that this book is in color. The one shipping from amazon.com must be a cheap reprint still selling for $19.95. The book is NOT in color, so the maps and photographs are difficult to interpret. Fortunately, I was able to find the original, color version for the same price in Colorado before I got to the park. I tried twice with amazon.com to get the right version (in color, with rounded book corners) to no avail. I finally just requested a refund."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Cheaply made plastic and looks it. Beware, if you choose to return this item you will be responsible for the $21.00+ fees for return shipping. When I bought this it was advertised as glass (even says so on the box it came in) but it's not. I won't EVER buy anything from CSN Stores again."
5,Great camera,"I owned a c-2020 which did a great job, but wanted a better zoom. The 740 is a fine camera for a wide range of users. I recommend this camera to anyone looking for a versitle camera with a great zoom."
2,forget the wide angle lens,"I bought the c-740 and decided to add the wide angle lens WCON-07. So after it arrives, I learn I cannot use it because it also requires an adapter ring. Great!So the adapter ring arrives and I connect the two to the camera. Well, the lens is so big it blocks the flash. I got the wide angle in the first place for indoor/portrait type photos, which often require a flash. It is just absolutely unbelievable that a major camera manufacturer is putting out garbage like this."
4,Olympus C-740 Ultra Zoom @ Bytesector.com,"Aesthetically beautiful, internally powerful, and user enjoyable; A few traits that are at the heart of Olympus's C-740. It is a 3.2 MP professional use camera for those who want to test the limits of digital photography. With magnificent 10X optical zoom lens and powerful user controls this camera is relatively low in price and high in features. Today we will explore what really makes this camera click! (View the full review @ Bytesector.com)"
1,Way Too Sensitive,"I bought this camera for the incredible zoom function. But, after using it for a couple of months, I dropped it a distance of about 3 feet. After that the zoom no longer worked. So, I sent it to Olympus to be repaired and it was not covered under warranty. I am not careless with my camera, but I dropped it once like everybody probably has. The camera shouldn't break that easily. This camera is way too sensitive!"
5,I love this camera,"I went to a 4th of July celebration where I took 319 pictures. Only 5 of them were bad pictures (probably user mistake). I have taken some awesome fireworks picture. The 10X optical zoom really helps get in close on subjects. The only MINOR complaints that I have are:1) It's not a fast click between pictures with AutoFocus.2) Camera settings are reset each time by default.3) When changing the quality to Super High Quality, the picture gets darker.All in all, I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Great photos for a Great price,"I received this camera 1 year ago for my birthday.It by far has not only saved me $$ on film, and developing but actually takes clear photographs. With amazing ZOOMcapabilities. Easy to use. Easy downloading.Only negative feedback I would have to say is having to purchase new batteries after evey 1000 pictures or so. I travel alot and take many many photos and would have preferred a rechargable battery.But all & all whether you are a beginner or a pro this is a very nice camera to have."
4,Great learning camera,"While a three megapixel camera may seem anemic in todays standards, the quality of pics are overlooked. I can take a quality photo at max resolution (which I beleive is plenty for any consumer or hobbiest) that looks far better than any 6 megapixel pocket camera of similar price. And try finding one with a 10x zoom! The camera can be set to fully automatic, or you can play around. There are lots of settings that can be adjusted and tweaked. Thats what makes this a great learning camera. And with the beauty of digital, when you screw up you just delete it."
5,The best digital around!,"This is my 3rd digital and this one was by far the most expensive. It is an amazing little camera. Beautiful close up shots and the 30x zoom works well, but as with all zooms, you must keep the camera steady or you will get blurry photos. I travel a lot so I will see how durable it is, but my previous Olympus took a beating and keep on clicking. Olympus seems to have the best lens currently. They just take extremely sharp photos when I compared them to Sony, Nikon, Minolta, and Canon. For me it was the best performer witht he features I wanted in the [right] pricerange."
4,If you like Neurosis and Mastdon..,"Then this album is for you. The tempo of the songs, and a lot of the vocals remind me of Souls at Zero era Neurosis. The riffing stands out like Mastodon's. It's just a great album all around. I really liked the last EP they put out, and this just exceeds it. It's also got a crust/hardcore sound to it as well, that just makes it even better. Motion and Presence is an awesome song, with a great intro that just builds into a heavy mass of noise. Another incredible song is In Memory, which has some great vocals and drumming, on top of the fierce riff that pummels you during the song. All in all this is an EXCELLENT album, and if you like anything Neurosis, Mastodon, or even His Hero Dies, then pick this up. Believe me you will not be dissapointed."
3,A pretty good read but hardly perfect,"Don Medley's ""The Book of Luke"" is a well thought-out murder mystery about a Mississippi attorney unjustly accused of murdering a beautiful young woman. Small town southern intrigue abounds in this thriller that is very gripping at times but towards the end becomes a bit contrived and not quite believable. I wish Amazon allowed 1/2 star ratings as I would then give this 3 1/2 stars but it is just not up to a 4 star rating in my opinion. Still, I recommend it as a good summer read."
2,Not Worth it,This product is not worth the money and effort needed to set it up. The physical material is poor quality and the boards came scratched up. The pulls are plastic and the set up is a hassle. It is also a very flimsy dresser. This product is a piece of junk. Although it doesn't look half bad.
2,Disappointed in the Bronx,"One of the back panels is missing. Otherwise, its a very nice chest. My nephew put it together for me. We couldn't find the last panel for the back, so we're disappointed, but will have to use it without it. I would have liked it a lot with all the parts."
4,USED OUR HANDY MAN TO PUT IT TOGETHER,"WE ORDERED THE PLATFORM BED, 2 NITE STANDS AND THE 5 DRAW CHEST CHEST, HEADBOARD. WE PUT TOGETHER THE PLATFORM & HEADBOARD, OUR HANDYMAN DID THE REST.WE JUST ORDERED THE TV STAND, AND WILL ORDER THE DRESSER. IT LOOKS GREAT AND EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE OF THE HANDYMAN IT WAS WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE.WE ARE 72-66 SO IF WE COULD DO IT ANYONE CAN DO IT."
4,Decent dresser for the price,"This dresser is nice for the price. It does have plastic drawer glides and is composite wood, so if you are looking for something top quality this is not the product for you. If you are looking for something reasonably priced and looks nice, try this dresser. The drawer handles look great, and the finish color is exactly as pictured. We are using it in a nursery."
2,looks nice but falling apart,"I purchased this for our new born. AS many folks have said, its a bit difficult/time consuming to assemble but since it was a one time set up, it wasn't that bad. The assembled product looked good and worked well for about 2 months and it started to fall apart. One or the other bottom drawers would not stay in the gliders and constantly fall off although they were not used much. Now it has come to a state where the bottom 3 are hanging out of the slots. Its a shame that this is falling apart but when it worked fine, it was smooth."
1,garbage,"Save your money and buy a quality piece of furniture---preferably one that is already assembled! I purchased this dresser six months ago and it is falling to pieces. Assembly is simple, but the quality is horrible. The bottoms of the drawers are constantly falling out and the the the rods are that glide the drawers in and out get stuck. At this point, I can only use two out of the five drawers because it is not worth the hastle to pry the drawer out once the bottom shelf droops and sags onto the drawer below it. I guess I got my money's worth!"
4,"nice look, definitely need more than one person to put together",nice chocolate drawer that can give any room an elegant feel. it was a nightmare to put together because i decided to do it myself. the instructions suggest calling a friend to help lol. nice size for an affordable price. I actually purchased the platform chocolate bed also.
3,Upright dresser,This one did take two people - who ended up with sore wrist - the look once the usit is together is good - I am using this to store linens and DVD. Depth of drawers is good for this. For every day use with clothes I would be worried. Side panels are a little warped
2,Looks cheap and is cheap,This chest definitely looks it's price. If you need something to throw your clothes in and dont care about the quaulity then you cant beat the price. If your looking for something that doesn't look cheap then dont buy this. It's that simple
1,Very poor quality.,"I normally do not review products but I have reason to review this one. I think that for this price you would expect a higher quality dresser. I want to spare anyone from buying it. First off it took a long time to construct. It scratches VERY easily. By the time I was finished constructing it, the paint had already been chipped and scratched in many places and I was very careful while building it. Secondly, I was shocked when I was inserting the drawers to find that there are no little wheels to assist the gliding of the drawers. The result is a struggle to pull out the drawers. The dresser looks very nice, but I was expecting higher quality."
3,chest,"The product came to my very house after a VERY long wait and when it did finally arrive, a large part of the wood was broken."
5,great & sleek,Came in quickly and was in great condition not one scratch. A little time consuming to assemble but worth it looks great dark rich brown almost black. Great price too.
3,"Walmarty, but decent.","First off if you love puzzles, you'll love putting this together with 100+ pieces. You can not rush when assembling either, you need to make sure every screw/nail piece is in very secure.Make sure you secure the plastic rails in very securely or the drawers won't open as smoothly. .You will have to study the directions before staring. It will take 2+ hours to complete if you are a first timer and are building this solo. I recommend having someone work on the drawers while you work on the base.You will have to work the pegs to get them to fit in the some of the holes.The paint on the edges will peel if you are rough moving it, or opening the drawers.Once put together it looks very nice. Not super strong but you can work with it if you handle it with care.I think $139 was a little too much to pay for this just based on the materials used (I also was missing 2 plastic pegs for the drawers). Maybe $70-$90.I give 3.25 stars."
2,bad shipping,well when it got here some of it was broke and i order new parts well they got here one part was drill wrong so i gave up and just drill my own holes
1,Junk Junk Junk Garbage,The item and the company product are junk. If it wobble when you ove it clap your hands clap clap. If it is hard to build clap your hands clap clap. This product is dangerous stay away from it the proguct sucks 5 year warrenty is good though to replace everything that falls of it in the mean time. South Shore furnture is just cheap flimsy junk never will I ever in a million year buy it again. A complete waste of my money hope I helped you change your mid about buying it is not worth it.
1,Didn't last long,I bought this for our new baby and it did not even last a year. Two of the drawer fronts have fallen off and the screws that are supposed to hold them on are too small and come through the hardware. A major disappointment but it was so cheap I should have known.
4,So far so good!,"I'm working on the Kitty Cat Lullaby but working it in black and white in honor of my best friend's cat. So far, this is a pretty enjoyable project even considering the popcorn stitch is used which is a stitch I've never really been good at. the only thing I didn't like about the book was that they could have made a close-up photo of one section of each blanket to show you the more complicated instructions up close and personal. But overall, it's an enjoyable book!"
5,Excellent Textbook for Organizational Behavior,"The Steers & Black Organizational Behavior textbook does an excellent job of covering Organizational Behavior for both undergraduate and graduate student. I've taught with several prior editions and wish that Steers would come out with a new edition. While the content of the book is still up-to-date, students have had a tendency to be turned off by the copyright date of the text. Overall, the text is well done and I'd highly recommend it for individuals desiring to gain additional information about Organizational Behavior. It also has a number of nice short personality-oriented tests which students seem to enjoy and which provide increased understanding of the concepts for the students."
4,Great Offering,"This is a great album if you are a Brooklyn Tab fan. It doesn't rock like some of the previous projects, but it is still worth having and listening to."
2,Tester is not accurate as discribed.,"I ordered one to test my house tap water and RO filter water. I was surprise by the reading I got. Tap = 430ppm and filtered water = 35ppm. So, I order 10 more of these for friends and families. Then the truth of the product Quality and Accuracy was reveal. All of them read differently using the same tap water. Well, to make the story short. One of the testers was not reading at all while 2 of the testers read 750 and 830 which is way above the range of tap water. Now, I am confused are these reading are accurate to determine the purity of my water. The worst part is that I am unable to call their customer support. The voice message keep telling you that their customer representative is busy serving other customer and leave them a message. In conclusion I do not recommend this product to anyone from now on. If you need to test the purity of your water I recommend buying the tester that you can calibrate with a reference fluid which is much more accurate."
1,Waste of money,Only worked for about 3 months and accuracy was uncertain. Suggest spending more for a quality meter the first time.
5,for every mother,this was an excellent gift to my daughter. The first time I heard the song she was 2 years old and I cried. So beautiful
2,Red Riding,"* Mild Spoiler Alert * I'm not giving away any key parts or conclusions *2 1/2 stars for realism and good acting.Although it is well scripted and superbly acted, this film is not what it appears to be.The main plot of the movie is about the corrupt officials involved in this and another case.Not, as I thought, about the pursuit and apprehension of the Yorkshire Ripper. In fact, the Ripper case is just an afterthought.In the beginning things are murky due to flashbacks to an earlier shooting where some policemen were shot.There is also a side story of an affair between two of the detectives on the (Ripper) case.Also the tragedies that both the mistress and the wife have suffered, which are not even connected.Wish they would have stuck to main plot, it was just a little too scattered for me.What could have easily been a 4 or 5 star movie only gets a 2 1/2."
2,Broken Spoken Words,"Believe it or not, I actually liked this CD for mainly it's camp value. It's a hilarious blend of Psychadellic Spoken word and Broken Major Tom type tunes that vainly try to channel Bowie but end up mimicking Weird Al"
2,not impressed,This is not a top cook book. It has some interesting suggestions but in general it does not capture the essence of persian cooking. For example bouillon cubes are a key ingredient many dishes.
4,Lovely first book.,"Stacie Patterson has exceptional insight into the world of the troubled teenager. The tale is fraught with mixed emotions as the main character struggles to deal with the death of her beloved mother and the distance she feels between her and her father.You will forget the passage of time as you turn the pages in search of the resolution of her colflicting feelings. This young lady is certainly a modern girl, gaining greater independance daily. She is also a youngster of great faith which is refreshing in an age where it's not ""cool"" to admit to your faith.Young girls (and boys) can relate to the daily problems and the interaction bewteen the other girls vacationing at the lake and our heroine. This book is one which will be enjoyed by the young readers and will be approved by the parents of these youngreaders.Lovely book, Mrs. Patterson!"
2,Needs help,"This controller worked fine for a few years with my 45 watt solar system. Then it had trouble starting the charge and preventing overcharging. Now, it won't start charging if the sun comes up slowly (only works if the sun breaks through the clouds quickly) or if I disconnect it and reconnect it so it sees the charge for the first time. Also, it no longer stops charging at about 13 volts like it used to and has overcharged my battery. This was the second SolarPro charge controller I've had for my system (the first one just stopped charging completely) and I am going to move on to a different brand."
3,Expensive,I love this anime and everything it's one of my favorites but it is not worth $300 I only paid $30 for the first season.
5,Funny take on La-La Land,"This film is a biting take on fame and the city that's on an endless search to foist it on people. Anyone who's ever been on an audition will laugh/cringe as the true humilations of such events are placed squarely in the crosshairs. What this film lacks in production values, it more than makes up for in humor and insight into the world of entertainment. Well worth your time and money."
2,Not my type of picture,This was just not my type of picture. I couldn't wait until it was over. The picture was slow moving and seemed to take forever to end
1,Seen better Wondered when movie actually started,This is a wierd one Ordered by mistake and now selling in ebay. Not by far one of my best choices but might apeal to you if you like to be fooled into thinking that this is for real. i really would not waste my time nor my money like we did by buying this dvd and then spending the time to watch it and then still be waiting to see what the heck it was about
4,A very good buy-Credentials Calendula Oil Free Creme,"I bought this after suffering from an outbreak of skin colored bumps on my entire face. After using it for a week, all these bumps are gone. The cream soothes irritated skin almost immediately, it's very gentle, non greasy and refreshing. I give it 4 stars because the packaging does seem a bit cheap, i.e.: the quality of the jar, and appearance of the cream. However, it is no problem because this cream works and the price can't be beat. If they need to sacrifice fancy packaging to keep the prices reasonable, then so be it!"
1,Unsafe!!!,"On our first two (and only) trips out with this stroller, this stroller tipped over frontways. The center of gravity is too far forward and when going over slightly uneven ground, like from pavement to a slightly raised grating or the slight ledge from street to a driveway, the front wheels stop and the stroller tips forward. The only reason it did not completely flip over, with our baby's head toward the ground, was that the rear axel beneath the handle bars smashed into my shins, both times, preventing the rear wheels from flying up."
5,Works with Chicco Key fit 30 - Great light weight stroller,Works with Chicco Key fit 30.Not super sturdy but reasonable product.Easy to assemble.Light weight.
1,Doesn't snap!!!,"Why on earth is this called a SNAP n' go when there is no snapping involved?! The car seat just sits in the frame à la shopping cart, with a flimsy belt to tie is down. The wheels can do some pretty rad moves, but I wouldn't do those moves with my baby in it! I'm returning it and buying a chicco one so my carrier snaps in properly."
1,Cheaply made!,"I am a first time mom so in the beginning I did not know how to choose a stroller. My friend recommended the baby trend snap N go stroller. I go out for a walk with my baby everyday. I have used it for almost 4 months now. I have never bought any other stroller before so I can not compare if this one is more light weight than others. However, the worst thing of this stroller is when you go to some slightly uneven pavement, the stroller is not very stable and sometimes it can statle your baby. There is only one bar to secure the car seat. I don't feel very secure going with my baby in this stroller. There is also some problem with the wheels. If you are going straight, it's fine. But when you want to turn left or right, you need tremendous maneuver to push the stroller. I would not recommend this stroller."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!,"Baby Trend Single Snap N' Go StrollerThis is an amazing product. If you have an infant, you MUST have one of these!!!!"
2,wheels fell off!,"My stroller's rear wheels fell off the axle...after only a dozen or so uses. When I called the company, they didn't even ask any questions, just said they'd send me hardware to fix it. Apparently, mine isn't the first to have this problem!"
2,Basket? For what?,"Yes, it's lightweight, convenient, etc. Two big pet peeves. Not very stable on uneven sidewalk - so I couldn't use it in my Los Angeles, neighborhood. Also, you can't reach the basket with a car seat on it. The smarter moms I know got the Kolcraft."
5,Can not imagine not having this product,"Light weight and very very convenient. It is ""Must Haves"" when you have a bay in a capsule. Love the big basket at the bottom. Highly recommend it."
3,Buy the Chicco Keyfit Caddy Instead for the Chicco Keyfit Infant Car Seat,"I highly regret selecting this frame stroller for my baby registry on amazon. I wish I had selected the Keyfit Caddy for my Chicco Keyfit30 car seat. There is absolutely no comparison in quality between the two options. The Baby Trend is neither easy to push nor maneuver if you have a heavier baby and the strap is extremely inconvenient, often getting caught in the wheels when you're in a hurry and forget to secure it. I would not recommend this product, as the Keyfit Caddy is most certainly worth the additional cost."
2,NOT USER FRIENDLY!,"Although this stroller is a great invention, whoever designed it did not field test it. The straps that go over the top of the infant car seat to prevent the seat from flipping over are constantly getting stuck in between the folding rails/frames of this stroller. Additionally, the red stoppers on the bottom of the handlebars have to be turned out every time you want to fold the stroller up for storage or in when you want to place the car seat on the stroller. Why couldn't they design it so that the stroller can fold or unfold in just one or two simple steps? Not to mention the aforementioned straps that are constantly getting caught in between the frames when folding and unfolding this stroller."
5,Great with keyfit 30,"I have the Chicco keyfit 30, which is a great car seat, but rather heavy. This makes my snap n go indispensable. It isn't the equivalent of a high end stroller of course, but its pretty sturdy, and quite light. One of the reviewers complained that the keyfit isn't compatible, that the seat gets scratched by the stroller. If used properly (there are little red tabs which have to adjusted to a larger car seat like the keyfit 30), it may still cause the most superficial of scratches, but certainly doesn't endanger the integrity of the seat. I agree with the complaints that you have to go around to the front of the stroller to get things in and out of the lower basket, but this is a minor complaint. It handles pretty well. It takes some assembly, but nothing too complicated."
5,GREAT STROLLER FOR PARENTS ON THE GO,"I bought the SNAP N GO when I had my son 2 years ago and found it to be the best invention ever. I had a c-section and this stroller made it so easy for us to take our newborn everywhere. The stroller it lighweight and we simply snapped his car seat into the SNAP N GO and went. I loved it so much we purchsed one for my sister-in-law who just had a baby. Needless to say, she raves about it every chance she gets."
4,"Smooth ride, Very convenient","I'm not a big stroller user, but this one really is very useful for taking a sleeping baby for a walk after a car ride, etc.I have not had any issues with anything falling apart and pushing it is a breeze so far. It folds up really easily for me.I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the storage cloth compartment falls sometimes for me."
5,Loved this thing,I did not want a fussy car seat or travel system so I bought this to use with our Baby Trend car seat. I got great use out of this. It was light weight and worked as it should have. It rolled smoothly. It resembles an old pram when the car seat is in it.Now we move on to a larger stroller since baby is no longer in his car seat. Bummer. :(
1,It doesn't Snap N' Go Stroller,"I bought the Baby Trend Snap N' Go stroller for my chicco keyfit 30 car seat and it does not snap in at all! I would not recommend these two products together. The only thing that holds the carseat into the stroller is a flimsy little strap and at a slight angle the car seat moves....thus no walking up any minor hills or on semi-bumpy roads without putting your baby at risk.I really liked the idea of having a less expensive stroller option for running errands around town and being able to get in and out of my car without having to transfer a sleeping baby into a stroller. However, if you bought the chicco keyfit 30 (a great car seat), then you should buy chicco's version of the snap n' go to make sure your baby is safe and secure, even if it is double the price. The quality of the stroller is double the value as well so you are getting what you paid for."
3,It's ok....,"It's not sturdy, feels like the wheels will come off because they just snap on.Definitely no an everyday stroller, good for a quick trip. You get what you for."
3,functional,"The snap and go is such a great concept! It is very easy to assemble. It is easy to get the infant seat on and off. The basket is a great size and is easily accessible with the infant seat on. The parent tray is a nice size. And it is so convenient but, be aware that it is only good on smooth sidewalks. It steers terribly. Never try to steer with one hand...it is a bear...I love the convenience of this stroller I just wish it steered better. Guess other models that cost more might. If you only use it for trips to the mall and stores it is great but don't plan on using it for anything else..."
5,Must have,Baby seat easily and quickly snaps in to make a nice lightweight stroller. Easily folds for storage in the house or trunk. The whole system is wonderfully thought out and easy to use.
1,not woth the $,don't buy - go for the city mini if budget allows. this stroller has manueverablity & is clunky...
4,Very good product,"I ordered this because i didn't have the stroller to go along with the carseat my brother gave me. I love this product. I keep in in my trunk for days i go out, especially to shop. Very convenient. I recommend this."
4,Practical,"We use this car seat carrier with our Graco Snugride infant carrier. When I see my cousin lugging her huge ""SUV"" stroller into her actual SUV, I know we made the right choice! The Snap-n-Go if very lightweight, folds up easily, and has held up nicely to a fair amount of abuse. And because it's so small, going out in crowded places isn't as daunting as it might be with a larger stroller.I have noticed that the ride isn't as smooth as it was five months ago when the baby was born, but it's still OK. There is a good amount of space in the basket but I sometimes have trouble squeezing the diaper bag through the opening in front (and there isn't an opening in the back, which seems like the more logical place for it.)Overall, though, it serves its purpose well."
3,You get what you pay for,"Pros: Lightweight, convenient, affordable, take it anywhere stroller. I found this most useful when we recently flew back home and didn't have to worry about having our son's nice(r) stroller getting smashed and mangled along with other luggages that are checked in.Cons: Flimsy structure, makes me a bit nervous putting my baby in his carrier on it. The button that you press to fold it is of poor quality. Many times, I have to press on it really hard to get it to sink in and snap. All of the cups I've used and put on the holders spilled liquid at the slightest vibration. The material they use as bottom compartment easily tears.This product is good if: a)You want the convenience especially for traveling b) You want to wait on getting a full size stroller until your baby is a bit bigger. Just don't expect a whole lot from it, other than it being easy to use and cheap."
1,Doesn't fit with Britax B-Safe,"I purchased this car seat carrier few days ago, because I need something lightweight for my baby during trip. This car seat carrier is very nice, lightweight and ext., you can read other reviews about it.Why I rate it 1 star? Because of the Manufacturer on the web-site said that it will fit Britax car seats. In fact it doesn't. I have a Britax B-Safe car seat and this carrier didn't fit and I was forced to return it. Manufacturer has to give more detailed information about his products to save time and nerves of customers who would like to buy it."
1,Not worth your money,Bunch of washed out previews and some vhs edit rainbows point to low qualityfor trailers available elswhere that are much better in quality.Good try but no prize for this company.
1,Nothing New Here,"I had the chance to read the book, as a colleague of mine had a copy of it. To me this is not poetry but rambling. It was worth the price that I paid for it-nothing. Langston Hughes and E.E. Cummings would cringe if they read these ""poems."""
3,Awaiting The Sequel,"Compelling Joy by William Aiken, Sr., is a poetic expression extolling the virtues of the love relationship between God and his creation. ""A Poetic Journey Through Life,"" chronicles the poet's progressive encounter with love, characterized by faith, family, friendship, and romance. The poet allows love to speak through him in tones of agape, philia and eros. Agape speaks through references made to God; philia speaks affectionately of family and friendship, and eros in the words of the ""Scrumptious Black Woman,"" puts us in touch with the sensual side of human nature. The poet is right when he says ""we can not allow anyone to define for us who we are,"" for Love pre-defined who we are by creating us in the image of God. Finally, the poet doesn't leave us with the false sense that all in love is fair. But the poet shares with us the temporary frustrations, uncertainties and failures common to all who are ultimately victorious. Thanks Bill."
1,It's a first effort.,"I actually found this book on a plane, someone had left behind-probably purposely. For a first effort it's ok. Hey it looks like it's a self published book to me. I did not find the poems very special. The poems seemed very ""elementary."" This probably explains why it's self published- what big publishing house would ant to put it's name on it. I do commend Aiken for the effort, although a lackluster one."
1,Prolific Poet? I don't get it.,"After reading some of the reviews on this site, I expected a wonderful read in this collection of poems. It just goes to show you you can't always trust reviews, especially on-line. I found the poems a bunch of mindless prattle. One of the previous reviewers claims that aiken knows women as demonstrated through his poems. From my own interpetation, it seems to me that either he's been married several times and/or is afraid of strong Black women. This book is just a bunch of chapters of ""chatter"" written to give the author something to publish so he can say that his book is in the library. My guess is that all of these previously terrific reviews of the book came from the author's parents. I would like to see a real criticsm of it in a reputable publication."
1,18th Century Ideology,"These poems display so much sarcasm in reference to Black women that it is frightening. Please enter the 20th century at least Bill. The flesh is willing, but the spirit is unable to compose real poetry. Try reading some Giovanni to get an idea about black women. L. Ckutoro-Poet"
4,Not so Savage Savagery,"So, it turns out much to everyone's surprise that our mediatainment industries are not churning out quite so much despicable junk to poison the minds of our children. Seems that violence has always permeated our entertainment, and at times in the past the amount of killings, etc., actually superceded today's low standards.So is it evil or does it actually help our kids by letting them dispel fears and anger via fantasy and fun? Read Schechter's intelligent study and decide for yourself."
3,no meat to it,"I know Gypsy magic, my grandmother practiced it. and we are Gypsy (spanish) and I just found this book to be a bit lacking."
3,gypsy magic,"I was very pleased to find this book on the store shelves. I am researching gypsies and gypsy magic for a role I play at a Rennaisance Faire. The book is written by a Rom and gives the reader a good idea of what they are about re: magic. The book is fun but it doesn't get too detailed. Depending on what you are looking for, that could be good or bad. If you are just starting out this is a good place to start but don't think you will be getting all the gypsy ""secrets"" the author just skims the top of a very deep subject. Maybe there will be a part 2. If you are interested in gypsy culture, I recomend a very good book: ""We Borrow the Earth"" by Patrick Jasper Lee. It's a very easy read and very hard to put down."
3,"Very vague, very basic introduction","The things she says are things I've heard spoken of in the family (Hungarian and Russian) but she's keeping a lot for herself. And so she should. It's been good to read about my heritage and the things I've felt intuitively, but it would appear to be something I need to learn from an actual live person. The other reviewer was probably right about her writing for the ""gadje"", you can't go and practice with what little she's written. Still, it piqued my interest and I will research the subject further. A good companion I found that went a bit further into Eastern European magic was Grandmother of TimeThe Grandmother of Time: A Woman's Book of Celebrations, Spells, and Sacred Objects for Every Month of the Yearwhich is a much deeper look at traditional female spirituality."
5,It does exactly what it looks like it does,"All you have to do is look at this picture for 2 seconds and you know what you are buying. If you want to mount a guitar on your wall, this is your mount. The thing that is great about this is that you can adjust your guitar from near 90 degrees up and down to 180 degrees flat. If your mounting into a stud, 4 wood screws are what you need, if it's into drywall I would recomend toggle bolts to get the best grip. I have a Les Paul Custom on mine and at nearly 11 lbs, heavy for a guitar, this mount doesn't even budge. Highly recomended!"
5,Great,Great if you want to mouunt your guitar sideways. Love it! Try and find a stud in the wall for a super secure mount.
5,Wonderful guitar hanger....,"Wasn't quite sure what to expect. Seems like a simple enough task for it to perform, but was curious as to how well it was executed. This is without a doubt one of the best guitar hangers out there. In addition to hanging an Ibanez Les Paul electric style guitar, it hangs my B.C. Rich Warlok (which has an odd shape) with ease. Installation was quick and simple and the version I received allowed me to adjust the angle just fine. The bracket is well constructed and solid. Again, should be a simple process, but sometimes not well executed. However, I am delighted with this product... it is simple and straightforward and very well done. Thank you!!!"
4,"Sound quality, inventive design.","I was pleased to find that this product is of high quality, and its inventive design make it a good value.I bought two units, each of which support heavy guitars with odd shapes. You will find that a standard electric guitar will fit as well as a flying-v or even a double-neck guitar. You will only need to carefully consider the angle that the instrument will be displayed at to best secure it in place.These holders are a great way to get your gear off the floor and out of harms-way."
5,Great product!,"Bought this for my husband. He loves it. We have two of the horizontal guitar holders and two of the String Swing Hardwood Holders. They look great, were easy to mount, and allow you to create a great wall display as well as allowing easy access to your guitars."
5,Perfect Guitar Mount for your wall - display 'em proudly...,I've got my Carvin H2 Fatboy hanging on the the wall at a cool angle thanks thanks to this well built String Swing. It's perfect.
2,Didn't fit acoustic bass,"The title pretty much sums it up. Didn't fit an acoustic bass, the body of the base was too thick. Amazon quickly and accurately processed the return. Wound up buying some big hooks at Walmart and they did the job for much less money."
5,life in Julius Caesar's Rome,"This is a wonderful adventure story featuring a young girl who's almost grown and her younger brother. Their adventures begin with a slave uprising on their country estate. They then become the captives of a pirate, with whom they become friends, and a number of other adventures. This book shows what life was like in Rome during Julius Caesar's lifetime. This book has a sequel, Theft of the Golden Ring, which is also an exciting adventure story."
4,Mostly from scratch recipes.,"This is a cute series of cookbooks. I bought her second one this year to give as our neighbor giftsthis holiday season. Also picked up here cute little sampler to also hand out as gifts this year whenwe attend neighbor gatherings.Meantime this one is fairly basic and perhaps a bit conscience of using low fat products but I believeshe mentions you don't need to. Haven't had it long enough to try out a lot of the recipes. And I'm always happy to have a Cookbook that I enjoy even 1-5 recipes in. I never cook everything of course as it goes. ShHHH we have a no new cookbook policy in place in our house. Everyone ignores it of course and the 20 some feet of cookbook shelves keeps growing.....amazing how that happens:))))So after we saw the ones for gifts someone just had to order the first one too. EAT DRINK BE MESSY,Life is too short....oh right...then walk walk walk that food right off:)))"
3,poker house review,"It was only satisfying, only because actress Chloe Grace Mertzpretty much caries the movie. Selma Blair, gave an worthy performance, but not enough to have notice in the film. The filmed gives us a slow start, and look at the reality of a young girl, and her sister,d fighting to survive an abusive home. Thier mother, who's spiraling downward continuously, from the,the heavy use of drugs. But a great thing happens that I enjoyed, Agnes, the older sister steps up and assumes responsibility for her two younger sisters. As the film tuggs along, Agnes realizes her motheris so strung out on drugs, she looses the mind set to care for her two daughters. But Agnes picks up theprices by getting things back in order to care for herself and two you.nger sisters."
1,I Blame This On Tommy Matola,"Come on now, I know that you have figured it out. This is the best defamation in the world: Find some poor Mariah Carey fan on the street, and then have the (insert bad name) enter a studio and sing Mariah's songs. When I heard this album at first I wanted to die, then I wanted this girl to die. Mariah I just want you to know that I feel your pain. Sweet Mariah probably doesn't even blame the girl, but I do: I know she has friends and someone had to tell her that she can not sing, she can't even stay on key...her pitch is horrible and her disgusting faux Whistle Register is [sad] and disgusting, and this is from someone with the Whistle Register (that's Mariah's tradmark high note). Mariah please, let me take out the knife that Tommy Mattola put into your back. I LOVE YOU...Charmbracelet is the best album in the World."
1,I'm sorry Mariah!,"I just wanted to apologize to Mariah that someone would make a tribute so bad for her. She deserves way better being the amazing artist that she is. Keep bringing the music girl, but please never have this person do a tribute for you again!"
2,Huh???,"I came across this CD at the store today. I bought it because it was ten dollars cheaper than her Greatest Hits Cd. Ugh! WTF is this?? Who is singing? The CD doesn't say, cdnow doesn't say, and amazon doesn't say. I see why the woman (or women???) singing didn't want to take credit for it. This is awful. If you can't hit the high notes, then you CAN'T sing like Mariah! Eek. It gets two stars because it's amusing to hear this amateur embarrass herself. I feel bad for her."
1,YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING!,"Wow, this is the worst thing I have EVER heard...unbelievable! I wonder if Mariah knows about this! Anyway, I'd have to agree with the reviews about this sounding just like bad BAD karaoke.Your best bet would be to just wait until Mariah's greatest Hits comes out Dec. 4 and get the real deal."
1,THIS ...!!,I am the BIGGEST MC fan out there but this cd is a joke. The person who is singing it has no idea what singing is. I think they made this cd as a joke. Mariah would have never have authorized this.
1,TERRIBLE!,"This was terrible. The sound was very bad and this is like an insult to Mariah herself. I am a big fan of Mariah and I am ashamed that another fellow Mariah fan would produce such a bad job. Unfortunately, I do not recommend this to anyone. The album doesn't even say who sang the songs or anything - all it said was ""various artists"". That was very misleading. It was a nice try, but a little more effort would've helped."
1,HELL,"I think I am going to be sick. I don't think I have Heard anything more disgraceful in my life. I am a HUGE Mariah Carey fan. I thought this was going to be an album full of well known female singers that could actually SING! This album sounds like a skit on Saturday Night Live. IT WAS HORRIBLE, and I just listened to the first sound sample on the site! To make this short, I just have a few things left to say: Mariah would be appalled and embarrassed, if (which I hope she doesn't/hasn't)she ever heard this. This album is a disgrace, and should not have even been recorded. I hope this review helps any other Mariah Carey fans."
1,Tribute To Mariah? I don't think so!,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I am a huge Mariah Carey fan. I love her music, voice, and intelligence. But this so called tribute album absolutely sucks! The woman who is trying to sing Mariah's great songs is messing them up. Her voice can't even be compared to Mariah's. If I was Mariah, I'd be upset! No one can duplicate Mariah's voice and to even try would be a waste of time."
1,Mariah should be embarrased!,"They call this a tribute? Hah! It's more of an insult. Who in the *&%# is that singing on the album? Well, whoever it is that person couldn't even sing a Britney Spears song. I am extremely dissapointed. I thought Mariah herself, or other artists, would be singing her songs...not this nobody who can't even sing."
1,tribute? no you mean INSULT,"I am a big fan of Mariah Carey's work, but even if I wasn't, I would still be appalled by what I just heard when I listened to some track samples. I can't even start to imagine who gave the go for that cd to leave the studio! This goes out to that person: what, are you deaf?! The voice on that record is trully disturbing. To make this short, I'll jsut say that if this cd had been a so-called tribute to grandma, I would still be appalled!! Thank God for the ""listen to samples"" link on this website."
1,Doesn't Hold a Candle to the Real Thing,"I don't hate all tribute CDS, but this one is atrocious. If they wanted to cover Mariah, they should have at least gotten singers who could come close to hitting the high notes. This sounded like a bad high school talent show."
1,Amazon should create negative stars just to rate this album,It's the worse cover EVER of Mariah's songs!!! Don't even accept this CD for free!No wonder why they didn't include neither the singer's picture nor her name in the CD.I'm sure Mariah laughed so hard when she heard this joke... lol... lol...
3,Give this singer a chance...,"Having heard the audio clips myself, I felt the singer was doing a fairly decent job. There was absolutely no need for this enormous amount of dissing. I am not exactly a massive fan of Mariah Carey, but I believe this singer should be given credit for her courageous efforts in releasing this tribute album. Who knows the singer could be a fan of Mariah Carey's as well and that she decided to take one step further to release this album ..."
1,Very startling,"OK, it's tolerable if this singer can't reach the Mariah's supersonic notes. Expecting a person to reach those notes would be expecting too much. Can't reach high notes? Fine. Don't have Mariah's astounding vocal flexibility? Fine. But I think some intense vocal sessions would come in handy. Actually, judging from the artificial quality of this singer's voice, we can conclude that the unnatural and synthesized sound is the product of too many singing lessons. I think this very poor performance is the peak of this singer's vocal prowess. Just comes to show that some people are born with talent, while others, no matter how much money they spend on vocal coaches, will never compare."
1,Absolutely ridiculous,"Don't even dare to listen to the samples... It'll probably make you see your lunch again! This woman has the most horrible voice ever, feeling like she's even joking instead of singing! Completely no range flexibility, making her the worst choice to cover ANY Mariah's song! BOO!Obs: I gave it 1 star 'cos there's no how to give it none."
1,QUICK! SOMEBODY GIVE ME A KNIFE!,"I don't know what this girl was thinking when she decided to botch up Mariah Carey's high notes, but somebody needs to put her out of her misery.MAYBE if an ensemble of well-known singers attempted a tribute to Mariah, it would pass (e.g., ""Divas 2000: Tribute to Diana Ross,"" with Mariah Carey, Donna Summer, & Faith Hill). But this circus of unknowns? What the hell were the executives thinking when they released this into the public eye? That people would get excited and demand an album from the ""tribute"" singer?Sorry, don't think so. Obviously, somebody at Big Eye Records decided to mock Mariah Carey and released this album as a joke. This CD belongs in the comedy section of your favorite music store."
1,ZERO STARS!!!!! I HATE THIS ALBUM AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT!,THIS ALBUM IS A JOKE! THIS GIRL OR PERSON IS PRACTICALLY MOCKING MARIAH CAREY!!! DON'T THEY INTERVIEW THESE PEOPLE BEFORE THEY LET THEM SAMPLE HER SONGS!!??????? WHOEVER SANG THIS: GET A LIFE AND GO FLIP SOME HAMBURGERS OR SOMETHING!! YOU DO NOT BELONG IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY!! THIS ALBUM SHOULD LIKE TEN CENTS OR LESS!! 11 BUCKS?! ARE U INSANE???!!!! I'D RATHER STICK FISH IN MY EARS! SHHHUUTTTTT UUUUUPPPPPP!!!!!
1,Beyond Appalling,"If I could have given this 0 stars I would have. Mariah my dear, if you authorized this, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING. Good Grief this is beyond appalling, I love Mariah Carey, there is only one Mariah and alot of wannabe Mariah's. Bad enough Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson are out there but this person is even more disturbing than the two of them put together. This is not a tribute to Mariah it seems to be a money making ploy to capitalize on an amazing artist like Mariah Carey. With that said, when the dust settles Mariah will still be standing and hopefully this tribute will be a forgotten stumble in an otherwise amazing career. Mariah deserves much better than the butchering of her music ( I hope this was not someone related to her)."
1,WHO IS THAT?!?,I REALLY LOVE MARIAH CAREY AND IM PROBABLY ONE OF HER BIGGEST FANS BUT THIS IS REDICULOUS. NOTHIN LIKE THIS SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN STORES. IT IS A DISGRACE TO MARIAH CAREY.
4,better then mariah,i couldnt believe how good she sounds. i was impressed.you shud buy this cd to support this artist.
4,Encouragement for the discouraged.,"The book, ""Miracles Happen When You Pray,"" is a small book that is filledwith encouragement for those who may wonder if God cares about their needs - needs that may be small or huge, life-threatning needs for themselves or for someonethey love. There are many inspirational stories of how God does hear and answer our prayers."
2,eh,"I got this because it was cheap at K-Mart, and thank goodness I can return it. The ball is really small--I love how they omit the size from all of their information. I didn't pump it up with the pump, so I don't know how good that is (I used an air compressor)...the other equipment isn't too bad, but I was really getting this for the ball, which just so happens to be a piece of poopola. I wouldn't suggest getting this."
5,"Letters of the Century : America, 1900-1999","'Letters' is an excellent read. Very insightful, provokes thought and is intellectually stimulating. The chosen letters are excellent chronicles of time and most are either funny or moving. If you like history, you'll love this book."
4,Mail Mania,"Anyone with a genuine nose for gossip and history,this is the book for you. Not only are the historic letters of political and cultural fascination but the nature of the letters themselves, really let you in on a closed personal world. The act of transcribing events with only the one person in mind ensures that indivuality and uniqueness are qualities most evident in this collection. The span of history that this book covers marks the most striking events of the century. It is a must for anyone with a serious interest in American history."

3,hollow earrings,"Earrings look as pictured, but be aware that the earrings are not solid -- they are hollow in back."
3,Great Essays- but not worth it for the homeschooler.,"The essays are interesting, but don't buy this book if your focus is a home centered education. The focus of the essays really is revolutionizing an institutional setting. I don't think that an institution is the best place for a child to get an education, so the book really didn't ""jive"" with me."
5,Joey Molland rocks out,This CD by Badfinger's Joey Molland totally rocks out! Joey is in rare form as he takes the listener on a musical journey of guitar licks and fab singing! Any Badfinger fan will thoroughly enjoy his magic!
3,This Way Down,"I Iiked Molland's Badfinger material and bought this after purchasing the pretty decent Pilgrim CD. This cat needs a real producer. His singing is very bad and it detracts. He still writes very good pop-rock. But I can't understand how he can go from the insanely great Badfinger tracks to stuff as poorly put together as this. Somebody kick him in the Ass. No pun intended. I give it an average rating as I will put five or six of these on my iPod. Several songs could be real good but someone else should sing them. Why doesn't he hire someone? Is his voice really that deteriorated? The guitar work was more inspiring on The Pilgrim, too. I'd like to hear more from Molland still. Gargle with some salt water, Joe. You still write a good tune."
2,kinda silly,"I guess I wasted my money on this because it's really just a...well, it's a mat for sure, but it's hard to stay open, feels so cheap and plasticy and I tried twice to use it and gave up. It's easier just to get one of those $1 mats that are rolled up. Same idea and I can toss those after 1 beach season."
4,A not so passive way to move out of financial mediocrity,"If you're looking for a 'quick fix' for your financial woes - this isn't it. But if you're willing to look more deeply into how to live differently creating wealth while you do it, then step right up. Here we have a well written version of what I call ""practical spirituality"". It's less about ""thinking yourself into riches"" and more about ""being rich"" because everything in our life, be it lovefamily or money relationships all boil down to a simple common denominator - YOU - who you are being in relation to everything else. And the gospel (or good news) as told by Darel Rutherford is that we're not stuck with the original version of who we are, we get to choose again. And folks that works for me and I have chosen to be someone who is rich - it's no more difficult than choosing to be someone living in financial mediocrity and it's a lot more fun!"
1,"Great title, terrible book.","Great title, terrible book. He owns a tile and flooring company. I guess that could make him a miliionare. That's not rich. He teaches finances at his local church. That's not an expert. This is truly one of the worst books I've ever read. It appears to be self published. The desktop publishing looks like a ransome note and gives me a headache. The author is poverty stricken in relationship to literature. He's not intelligent but he is judgemental. His ideas are unoriginal, based on ""Think and Grow Rich."" Read that book, if you are so inclined. At least you'll be able to read it. A waste of a great title."
3,Assumes too much...,"While Dennis Prager makes some good points, he doesn't so much explain his ideas as state them as fact. From the very first chapter: Morality is impossible without a God. In the next few pages, he states that, to paraphrase, ""every leading moral philosopher agrees"" with that statement. I bought the book hoping for an objective view on Judaism and God. I don't feel that's what I'm getting."
2,Not for Everyone,"While some of the answers are very greatly written. Some may be slightly disturbed by such a provocative take on some the issues presented. The authors are both Conservatively minded and it shows. People looking for concise answers should go somewhere else and consult a Rabbi they are familiar with and not get to hung up on the controversial stances taken within the book. This is NOT Telushkin at his best, and I was somewhat saddened that such a brilliant man could take such narrow views on some issues."
1,"Title is misleading, premise is flawed","This book should really be titled ""The Nine Questions Practicing Jews Want Non-Practicing Jews To Ask About Judaism"". Instead, the title gives one the impression that this is a basic guide to Judaism for non-Jews. The authors cleverly draw you in with various commentaries before revealing their true goal: to bring non-practicing Jews back to religious practice. Everything they say to try and persuade ""strayed"" Jews to become religious hinges on the belief that the Torah is the Holy Word of God. If you believe that the Torah was written by humans and is historical fiction, these arguments won't sway you at all. And if you are not Jewish, this book won't really answer many of the questions you may have about Judaism."
3,this book didn't change my mind,"I tried keeping an open mind while reading this book, but I am still an agnostic, leaning toward atheism. Temple and hebrew school still bore me. Secular humanists can be good people; we don't need god or the Torah to tell us what is right and wrong, and we are quite capable of handing down our moral values to our children. I'm not going to pretend god exists, or act like he exists, just because I was born into a Jewish family. This book is well-intentioned and informative, but I don't get much of a thrill from Shabbat, and I like pork, and I would rather read about the Holocaust than pray to a god who clearly doesn't care what happens to me or Israel and anything at all."
4,Book review,I enjoyed this insightful look into modern Judaism today thru this book. I would recommend it to all who are interested in looking into the Jewish world.
5,A Life-Changing Book!,"This book taught me so much, and had me seriously considering converting to Judaism. If I knew a Jewish person well, there's no doubt in my mind that I would have him/her introduce me to someone who speaks to those who are interested in learning more about the faith."
1,Don't Look Here To Learn Judaism,Prager spends too much time pandering to right wing Christian Evangelicals.His version Judaism is soured.
3,Academic but biased towards Tibetan Buddhism,"This book is well written and scholarly, but has a definite Mahayana and Tibetan bias. For instance, the assertion that reincarnation and states of future existance (hell beings, hungry ghosts, etc.) is fundamental to all Buddhist groups is not true. The docterine stems from a 1200 AD Cambodian text, and there are Buddhist discourses that warn against debate on reincarnation (with arguements about the implicit assumption of a self or soul that may lie in this belief). The other Very Short Introduction to Buddha is less biased. For a better introduction, I would recommend Rahula's What the Buddha Taught."
2,Not Very Informative,"The book while well written, has too many instances of false information. The book tends to group specific practices together as if every school of thought is the same. This is a huge injustice. A better read would be 'A Buddhism Primer - An Introduction to Buddhism',"
3,Binding broke,"The book was new as it was labeled to be, but the binding broke and pages fell out the moment I first opened it. Either invest in some glue or don't purchase."
5,Great PFD's,"Ordered two of these and they are really nice. No bulkiness and they are comfortable. They are quite expensive, but they are worth it for our safety. Especially since we wear them religiously now when traveling on the lake or up and down the river. I feel much safer while moving on the water with this PFD on."
5,Safe boating,This life vest is so comfortable you don't even know you have it on. Even my husband is willing to wear his when we are out fishing. Gives me peace of mind.
2,Older Product,This life jacket was supposed to have five years on the auto inflating mechanisim but apparently it sat on the shelf for a while and only had four years left on it. These can't be returned so I lost a year of use.
5,Easy to wear Life Jacket,"I needed a life jacket that I could wear all of the time on the boat. This is the one to get! My kids have to wear one so I need to wear one. It is cool, and comforatble.Andy"
1,Dangerous Product,The inflatable vest manufactured by Mustang Survival lacks the most rudimentary quality control measures. Not only was the inflatable mechanism defective the cheap zipper containing the operating mechanism split open so it was impossible to reclose the vest.This company refused to accept a return because the vest was purchased through Amazon. Amazon refused to accept a return due to the vest contains a gas cylinder.Purchase products from Mustang Survival at the risk of death and customer indifference.
4,Mellow and Poetic Journey,"This is so much like a lost Velvet Underground recording. I discovered this at mp3.com, bought a copy, and I've played it for a few friends who have each mentioned that Velvets connection, which is pretty astonishing. That's tough competition for not a very big name artist, as none of us heard of him before, but maybe he won't be 'not very big' for long!"
1,The Same Ol' Song,"This CD compiles the same song over and over again just with different sounds added to the casio sampling machine. I guess if you have trouble falling asleep, you can pop this disc in for a goodnights slumber, but even then I think the only thing you may get are nightmares."
4,Seems to work well,"I used this to flush and replace the manual transmission oil in my 2000 Saab 9-3. Although I didn't get the stellar results I hoped for, I believe that this is good oil. The shifting is definitely smoother and quieter now. I can recommend this oil."
5,Great Product,"Solid product that has improved shiftability in my 2008 Toyota, especially cold weather shifts. It was slightly notchy at first, but quickly smoothed out as the oil worked it's way into the gears. Seems to be getting better as I put more miles on it."
2,No difference noted,I've been driving for a couple of weeks now since i put in the MT-90. It hasn't done anything to make shifting any smoother. Not really a difference at all.
5,Perfect,"I ordered 2 bottles of Redline MT90Red Line 50304 Manual Transmission (MT) 90W Gear Oil - 1 QuartAnd 2 bottles of Redline 75W90Red Line 57904 (75W90) Synthetic Gear Oil - 1 QuartI completed it with a K&N; HP-1008 oil filterK&N; HP-1008 Oil Filterand a fluid pumpFLUID TRANSFER PUMP-4CCto get the oils in my car.I have a Mazda Rx8 and used the MT90 for my manual transmission and 75W90 for my rear differential.I serviced it myself using the fluid transfer pump to put in the mt and diff oils.To complete it I changed the motor oil with Redline 5W30 (4qts)Red Line 5W30 Synthetic Oil - 1 Quart, Pack of 12and put in the K&N; filter. Now my Rx8 still drives like a charm. Only now smoother shifting at 8000RPM!!!And you really can feel the difference,especially when shifting. The Redline MT90 is highly recommended for this!! Redline All THE WAY for my 8!!"
3,If it's time (say every 60k)...,"I would go ahead and spend the money on this product. There was not much of a difference in my transmission right after I changed the fluid, and 3k later, shifting seems only a little smoother. At about double the cost of the regular fluid, I was expecting a bit more. I wish Redline products were more widely available at my local auto parts stores, though Auto Barn did an excellent job delivering as they stated."
5,Shift is very smooth,Installed Red Line MT in my new AX15 transmission in my 97 Jeep wrangler. The Red line not only helps with the 500 mile break in milage on the transmission but let's it continue to shift very smoothly.
5,No more grind!,"I had the dreaded 2nd to 3rd synchro grind which started in my 2001 Audi TT with 80k miles. Swapped out Redline for the ""lifetime"" Audi transmission oil and within an hour the grind was gone! Totally recommended and for $40 is substantially cheaper than the tranny rebuild your dealership will tell you you need!"
5,So smooth you can feel it,"Redline MT-90 is an amazing lubrication. My gearshifts are smoother, and moving starts in second gear now feel less shaky. I have a 4 cylinder manual 2005 Toyota Tacoma. I changed the tranny and tranfer case oil. You feel like a real man when you do maintenance like that. Plus, I saved like $100 by doing it myself."
5,GL-4 for old Porsche,"Works great in my 1983 Porsche 944. Smoothed out the shifting, especially in cold weather. Less sound and more fluid shifts. Especially neutral to first in stop-n-go traffic."
5,No more gear snicks,"After running Royal Purple 75W-90 in my 1991 Nissan 5sp for 60,000 miles I thought it was time for a change.Although I think RP is a good oil Redline MT-90 has proven to be superior in every way.Synchros are much more positive now and the 2nd and 3rd gear Snick is now gone, should have changed sooner."
4,Dave,"This is great. I never liked early Cyndi Lauper music, ButI loved the videos. So I would never buy the CD but this videocollection has every song I remember and then many more. Alsobefore each song she talks about it. The only reason that I donot give it 5 stars is that there is no audio commentary duringthe songs."
5,must have on video,cyndi is very much just as you would imagin her to be in a video of hers very great stories jokes all around full of fun energies.it includes a good mix of songs some hits some not but all beautiful. it really shows how vocally powerful she is (sure you know that though).and my favorite it includes the drove all night video.(the hottest video ever)its not all live shows but it still brings joy to watch. i feel its a must have in addition to her cds because its really wounderful to have a visual with your music.(by the way her new ep shine really rocks if you dont have it yet check it out)
3,She Needs to do a live concert dvd,Cyndi needs to do a live concert dvd which could be a 5 star. This collection of videos is good and merits 3 stars. Her live performances are the best.
5,Finally there's Cyndi Lauper material on DVD,But sony could have done a better job. You get dvd quality image and sound but nothing more than that cause they didn't bother to do an awesome job :( The videos made up for that lack of care - From the fun girls just wanna have fun til Hey now Cyndi's talent and beauty makes you want to watch this over and over. They could have added unreleased videos like Hole in My Heart and Goonies 're Good enough parts 1 and 2... Let's hope they release Cyndi Lauper In Paris - She's so talented it's a shame we have to wait centuries for each Cyndi release!
2,Cyndi is awesome but the DVD is horrible!,"I cannot believe Sony would do a ""rush"" poor quality job on this prized material. I have 12 Deadly Cyns on video tape and I think it's even better than this DVD. One bonus on this DVD is a new video for ""I'm Gonna Be Strong."" Cyndi struts her stuff with her signature yellow hair that is shown on the cover of the dvd and video.I rated it a 2 stars because of the poor quality. The material on this DVD is excellent. It's just too bad Sony didn't care (about the DVD and about Cyndi leaving Sony)"
4,Great Quality,"I was very pleased with the product seeing as i needed a new wing. It is the exact same as the other one in length, shape, color and weight except with no stickers. I recommend buying this product."
4,Rob Bocchino workshops,"I have not yet read this book, but I have been fortunate enough to see Rob Bocchino and learn many of his useful techniques, tips, and ideas about how to better meet the needs of students on a deeper and personal level. I guess I'm going to have to go ahead and buy the book as well. His workshops continue to give me hope and direction for how I want to leave my students and how I want them to continue to develop the world around them (educationally and emotionally)."
2,Too heavy for its binding adhesive,"I've always liked these magnetic notepads that you can just slap on the fridge. With them, I manage to forget far fewer things when I shop at the grocery store (I'm sure I'll always forget something - with my faulty memory I can hide my own Easter eggs - but since the dawn of magnetic notepads, I don't have those moments where I go to the store just to get milk and come back everything but milk).When I found this notepad, I was pleased, because it is about 1/2"" thick, which means lots of pages so I don't go through pads as often. Wrong. What it meant was that I used a few pages off the top and then the pad fell apart under its own weight. All of the pages fell to the floor in a clump, bound by their overtaxed adhesive binding, leaving the cardboard backing with the magnet sitting proudly and uselessly on my fridge.The pad is now on my kitchen counter and is just enough out of the way that I'm back to forgetting the milk again."
1,ALBUM COVER ALBUM,wouldn`t know purchased on dec 2nd and have NOT! received. terribile customer service. WILL NEVER DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN.
5,Bless me Father is worth purchasing for good entertainment.,"These videos have been used many times and they always keep us laughing,we are so pleased we took a chance to give them a try and as more become available our order will be sent."
1,DVD won't play,"I'm a huge Rory Gallagher fan and so am very much disappointed that this DVD won't play in my player. I've tried cleaning the disc and checked the machine with other disc's - they play fine. It appears to open and screen presents ""Play"", but it won't - any suggestions would be appreciated."
4,"Man let's down his fig leaf, at last.","Reading Upright Man was informative and fun. It is sympathetic and descriptive to the reality of life. Self help books are often dry, and although their purpose it to provide knowledge and insight, they often don't touch the reader.The wit and personal anecdotes make this book an intimate experience. An INSIGHTFUL read for both MEN and WOMEN."
3,The Prophecy of the Stones: A Novel,"The cool thing about this book is that it was written by a teen.The bad thing about this book is that you can TELL it was written by a teen. The actions of the characters don't always make sense (Jade, Opal and Amber are told that they are enemies when they first meet, but within five minutes they're the best of friends), the male romantic lead is every girl's dream, and a lot of the story is pretty predictable. There are some good moments, like the first description of the villainous Council, but on the whole this book isn't worth spending your money on. If you're a young girl, you'll probably enjoy the Barbie-esque, pink, happy feel this book gives off (I might be the only one getting that vibe, though.) If you're a little bit older, or just a little bit more discerning of a reader, you might be better off choosing something else."
2,Don't buy this,"I've got to give the young author credit for trying, but the book was boring and didn't make sense. I'm an adult and I read books in this age group and genre a lot, and I worked for 10 years in a popular bookstore chain, specializing in intermediate and young adult books. I think I'm qualified to judge such books, and this one was just not worth my time. The writing is stilted and the characters are shallow. The plot isn't well developed at all! It looks long, like another reviewer pointed out, but it's really not due to big margins, big print, etc., but it takes forever to read, it's just slow going. The ending is disappointing, too. Choose something else to read!"
4,"Why i didn't give ""The Prophecy of the Stones 5 stars","I thought the prophecy was well written. I have read alot of fantasy over the years, and because of that i'm am picky about which books I think are really good. Although i enjoyed the book tremendously it just didn't posess enough originality for me to give the full score."
4,The Prophecy of the Stones,"The book is a great fantasy book. It was really hard to put it down because you wanted to see how everything fitted together. I thought that the author was very creative by the way she put a twist on the classic battle between good and evil. The main story is told by a girl in a hospital dreaming it. Until the very end you really have no clue what the girl has to do with the story.You really start wondering what happens when the book tells you pieces of the girls future. The girls have a prophecy written about them, but you don't know how it will turn out or how it will happen.The book is definately one you will have trouble putting down!"
2,Thinking about it...,"Yeah. I remember reading this like, a year ago and thinking, ""Woah, what a FANTASTIC story!!!""But now I've read all these reviews(yep, all of them.), and I'm realizing that the girls ARE stereotypical(?), that there are plotholes big enough to drive trucks through, and re-reading...love at first sight just doesn't do it for me, and apparantly anyone else. I'm a young writer too, and I guess I know what NOT to put into my story.All and all, fantastic for her age, not so great for your avid reader."
4,the prophesy of the stones,This book took us into a wonderful world-I wish everyone could read it so they can be invited into it as well!
2,Not so great.,"I bought this book because I saw an interview on tv with the author. I thought it sounded like an interesting read. After reading this book, I have to admit that it's interesting maybe if you're younger than 15. Now, I know the author was only 13 when she wrote this book, but it does show. The dialog was lacking, too many events just ""happened"" with no real reason or point to them, it was slow reading, and the character descriptions were a very dry at times. All that being said, however, I have a feeling the her next book will be much better, because the potential to be an awesome writer is there, she just hasn't reached it yet. I recomend going to the library to check out the book instead of buying it."
2,Not bad for a 15 year old,"Had to FORCE myself to read to the end of this one. The whole way through, I kept saying to myself, ""it feels like this was written by a 15-year old"". Then at the end of the book I found out I was right! Immature writing, way too much melodrama, love at first sight (not once, but TWICE), serious plot flaws, an unnecessary parallel plot, and poor proof-reading made me feel I had wasted my money on this one.At the same time, I wish the author well, and hope she will continue writing. Will be interested to see what she will do when she gets a bit older...and wiser..."
2,"Not the best choice, or even a good choice","This book was obviously written by a young teenager. The names and places in the story are somewhat original, but I can't help but notice the unoriginality of a few, such as ""Fairytale,"" ""Rivenbell,"" ""The nameless one,"" and ""the outside."" The oddest thing is the creatures that go on strike against death. That is certainly out of the ordinary, I must say...I also had a hard time reading this book. I was constantly confused, leading to irritation and aggravation. When I read a book, I hope to enjoy it. Causing a reader to shed a few tears here and there, laugh out loud, and smiling once in a while shows skill in a writer. Yet in Prophecy of the Stones, I did not do any of the above. If I were forced to recommend this book to any age group, I would recommend this book to children, because a child would not notice the many flaws."
2,An okay book,"The gist of the story is interesting. But it's rather slow going, and shall I say... unrealistic? There's hardly any detail or depth, characters do a lot of things out of the blue, they give out information too easily, they trust too easily.The story strikes me as something similar to a fairytale; plot holes everywhere, the main characters are so pretty and wonderful. It's sort of even written like a fairytale (not quite though)The writing isn't that great. In one sentence, the word ""she"" was used 5 times.But as I said, the gist of the story *IS* rather interesting. Bujor has interesting story ideas. If she could improve her writing quality and realism of characters, she could be a good writer.I'm also a teen writer, and I congradulate Bujor for finishing a novel. That's a big accomplishment--even if the writing isn't great. Go teen writers!"
1,False Prophecy,"I couldn't bear to read more than seven chapters of this book. I know it was written by a thirteen year old, but it reads as if the editor didn't actually check it for flaws. One problem I had was that even though the three girls are in what seems like a medieval time period, one of them has a watch! I also couldn't feel any sympathy for one of the main characters. All in all, I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this book."
5,awesome,"i think this book is really good. it was kind of hard to get past the beginning which was boring but after that it was great. The ending was really good too, it didn't leave you feeling depressed or anything. I also couldn't believe that the author was only 13 when she wrote it!"
4,A Fun Read,"""The Prophecy of the Stones"" is a fun read. It's not a particularly brillant book, but it's good. It kept me interested, and I wanted to keep reading it. The dialogue could have been better, and only one other think irked me. The characters. They were all so PRETTY. That annoyed me to no end. Who wanted to read about 'Mary-sue's? But I got over it, and I loved reading it. The author shows potential, though I don't think this will be her best work. I think it beats 'Eragon' by a long shot, and I think the author's next book will be better. I'd also like to add that if you're an adult, you may not like it much. It's more a cliche kind of kid book. But really, it's good. Go buy it!"
2,"Good Idea, Needed Editing Before Getting Published","This story has a pretty original plot, and some interesting ideas, and may be worth a read on the basis of that alone. I think it would have been valuable to the reader to include some additional background information, as it would have helped the reader understand why we cared about the outcome of the book... I know, I know, good versus evil, obviously you want good to win, but I would have liked a little more than that.I did not realize that this book was written by a teenager when I read it, however, I don't think that that completely excuses whoever decided to publish it for the boring and simplistic writing. Perhaps the awkward sentence construction was due to the translator, but that should not have been excused either. There are some very awkward moments in the character development as well. All of this would have been improved by a more stringent editing process."
3,"A good, if not spectacular, debut","I found 'The Prophecy of the Stones' to be a fun read. It occasionally veers towards being shallow and superficial, though the concept was an interesting one - particularly the framing device, which I would have loved to have played a bigger part. The three girls, Jade, Amber, and Opal, were all interesting characters, with their personality traits corresponding to their individual gemstones, and there are a lot of nifty ideas within this novel. Worth reading, though I suspect it has lost something in the translation."
2,Eh...,"Warning: this will be a very short review, because there really isn't much to say about this book.In short, the plot has plenty of potential, but Flavia never takes it anywhere. As previous reviewers have noted, there are too many plot holes. It seems that Flavia wanted to write a ""deep"", symbolic novel, but as she probably didn't know much about symbolism, being only 13, she didn't succeed. To her credit, she is a tolerablely talented writer. But this book still did not deserve to be published. Read this for a few laughs."
4,Surprised,"This book has some interesting surprises.The characters are totally diffrent than each other.Opal,is a commoner that is emotionless.Jade,is a snobby noble.Amber,is a dreamy peasant.I like how this novel switches off between the girls and a real world sick girl named Joa.I would NOT give it 5 stars only because the characters are a little stereotypical. Also how can that one guy say ""I loved her"" after just meeting her?"
3,A fair read,"I must say, most of the plot IS really original. Most people think that being young is a disadvantage, and at some point, it is, but children and teens posess the special gift which is mostly lost in adults- the gift of creativity. But I think it really just goes too fast, with quite a lot of gaps in between. I especially don't like the love parts, because it's way too sudden and happens exactly the same in both Opal and Amber's experiences. As most of the reviewers say here, the plot is way full of potential, but the actual writing wasn't that good."
4,Good tips,"Its a good book overall, Although it has on both, I think its oriented more on how to please a man. It should be equally done.."
3,"Good, but i wouldnt rush to get it.","The book was fairly good. The humor in it was very ""Fosteresque"", which is a good thing in case you haven't read anythign from Lori Foster. However, I found that i enjoyed Treat Her Right much better than Mr. November. Josh is a very likable character, Amanda, on the other hand, isn't. I'm not saying she's a bad character, she isn't, she's rather sweet and i would dare to say that some of you would even indentify with her, to a certain extent, but i found that after viewing Del (Caught in the Act) and Wynn (Treat Her Right), as 2 very independent, sexy, caring and strong women, seeing Amanda was a dissapointment. But she is not as bad as she could have been. The story is nice, but its nothing from the other world. I say it could have been better, but then again I'm a very difficult audience. I recomend it, if you have nothing else to do, or not another book to read."
3,JUST COULDN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN!,"Gorgeous, sexy men - if a bit of a tom cat attitude to sex.Finally a virgin - at least in her mind if not in her actions.Story plot just does not hold up. Too much mind blowing fantasies without much reality.Ah well, this is Temptation - not enough meat to the plot - too much marshamallowism.I liked the character portrayals but no enough about their jobs that make them who they are.Sassy, Sexy, Seductive! That just about sums it up. Not much else.Josh Marshall, 27 and has had tooo many women - wouldn't want an over used character. Amanda Barker, 24 - too forward for a virgin. Not enough real shyness [innocense]to be realistic.Her fund-raising hunky calendars have caught on. Must applaud Josh's reluctance but hey? Nope, their attitudes just don't make it happen.Nice to find out what happened to the characters of Mick, Zack and Josh. But really didn't miss much.OK to read but ------"
4,Mystery better than Terror,"This book includes nine tales of terror and six tales of mystery. It was written in 1923, four years before the last of the Sherlock Holmes books.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is obviously at his best at mystery rather than terror. Fortunately, the mystery stories tend to be the longer of the two.The tales of mystery really do remind one of Sherlock Holmes. In one, one character states that if you have exhausted all the possibilities except one, that last remaining must be the truth no matter how farfetched it appears. In all the tales, he sets up mysteries that are solved in the Holmes style. Though not Holmes, some of the characters are quite interesting, and it is fun to try to figure out the answers to the mysteries.Good short stories. I recommend this book, at least the mysteries section."
4,Tales of Terror and mystery,"It was a good book to read and the various tales kept my interest till the end,but as far as terror it was mild and I thought of the whole book as one of just some mystery stories"
3,Archaic,"These stories are not the greatest nor are they the worst. They are definitely dated and may not be of interest to 21st century readers. They were fairly predictable. No, I wasn't terrorized."
1,Not terrifying or mysterious,"I have no clue why this book has this title. It is very misleading and I felt no sense of wonder or terror in reading it. Just boredom and remorse at even purchasing it in the first place. Even if it's free, please save your time and read a real book."
3,"Great Product, but too Small, Even for My Small Dog","I got thisRichell 94531 Paw Trax Pet Starter Kit - Largefor our 20 LB Chiwhuawa Mix. The description was misleading, as it says it is ""Large"" but did not give dimensions. Well, it IS too small for our little guy. He has no room to do his little circling routine. Plus, being a boy, there IS plenty of room to miss!! Might be okay for a toy breed, & ""maybe"" some small-breed dogs, especially female... but even then, I personally think it's a bit too small. Now I'm stuck w/ it, unused. Too bad 'cause product itself actually seems really good & durable enough, & literally a snap to use."
5,phenomenal!,"This is one of the best books of poetry I've ever read. I personally own over 100 books of poetry, including anthologies and I can say, without a doubt, this may be one of the best books written in modern times and certainly in our lifetime."
3,Meh,"Well I did not keep this long as I found Pinsky to be epically dull. I expected as much, but hoped for better. I am not too fond of modern poetry, but who could forget Robert Pinsky's fabulous cameo on ""The Simpsons""? I always wondered how that ""Basho, Banana Tree"" poem would end. Badly, I thought, after reading it. Touch of a letdown. But it was worth perusing. I will appreciate that episode more when or if I ever see it again. Most of the poems I failed to finish. And I had high hopes for his poems on therapists and America. If you hate Billy Collins, and I mean really despise his formula and signature ""voice"", then Robert Pinsky...is not going to be for you either. If you love Collins, I can't promise anything, because I find Collins much wittier, deeper, and more fun, though I'm still not a Billy Collins man, for the most part. I've never seen a single Pinsky in a poetry anthology...so maybe that should say something."
3,two roads,"Technically brilliant, sonically frugal, stylistically innovative, thematically esoteric, topically abundant and educated. Sure.Pinksy is all these good things, but ultimately hollow. He perks the mind but dulls the soul. But no matter. He has given to poetry what he can: a voice and face, a teacher's wisdom, a word to the masses, and (of course) technically pristine verse. This is as far as his person can take him - and he should go no further.He's aced poetry, but failed to do what the greats do: transcend his very words. Keats fills me, while with Dickinson, I shrivel. Of Pinsky, I think of Frost, down the road more travelled."
3,Eyebrows are not as pictures,The picture of the mask does not match the one received. The eyebrows are the issue. If they were as bushy as the picture this would be a great mask. The eyebrows with this mask were stitched to hang over the eyes.
2,Mask defective?,"Let me start off by saying this is the second mask of this kind I have purchased, so I know how it is supposed to look. The mask i received had the correct face, yes, but the hair was not attached properly I guess, and the look of the whole mask was ruined. The eyebrows were supposed to be big and bushy, as pictured, but they were instead flat and seperated into two lines, making it look like he had two eyebrows over each eye. Also, the hair on one side hung straight down, and the hair on the other side shot straight up. Clearly, there is an issue with how the mask is being produced that is causing some errors in workmanship. I don't know if this particular company is to blame, but I would want to see the mask in person, before I bought it if I were to do so again."
2,"Cute, but not without issue.",I got this as a joke for my husband who once casually mentioned that he liked bats. I decided to make him 3 dozen sugar cookies with the bat shaped cutter. The very narrow space between the wings and body made the wings fall off more often than not when moving them from counter to cookie sheet. Even making the cookies thicker doesn't help because they fatten during baking to the point you can't tell it is supposed to be a bat.
5,Great album,"This is an icredible album with strong performances. I do agree with the prior review, if you like Delerium you will definitely like this cd, especially considering that the ""girl who sounds like the singer from Delerium"" is actually her! That is Kristy Thirsk singing on that Balligomingo track!"
5,"A nice, fun, and respectful take on a classic","As a Spaniard I was a little skeptical of retake on the literary classic of Don Quijote. However, the project was dominated by Spaniards who are able to respect the original work and poke fun it at the same time. My seven year old loved it and laughed his head off. I was also impressed with the attention to detail. For example the moon waxes and wanes along with the story accurately.Donkey Xote"
2,H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E,"Please don't put yourself through this. Even worse, don't put your kids through this. The movie tries hard to be intelligent but fails miserably. It was difficult to follow the convoluted plot which kids will never figure out. Even IF the dialog was written well, lines go by too fast to make sense of what they are talking about. Maybe it makes more sense in Spanish but I highly doubt it. Do your family a favor and pass on this one because it will be 90 minutes of your life you can never get back ;) Oh yeah, the graphics were decent."
2,boring,"boring, Only good thing was the previews which led me to dragon hunters which is an awsome animation!!"
3,an okay movie,"this was an okay movie. the only thing i liked about this movie was the donkey Character, not donkey xote. i give this movie 3 stars for effort."
2,Don't waste your money!,"The book ""Why Aren't You Rich"" is excellent. The workbook is juvenile in presentation and just didn't have the depth of the book. I bought this book used for 5 bucks and it was still a waste of money."
2,Affordable but...,"Commendably, Mr. Brooksher has added another volume to the limited literature devoted to the American Civil War in the West. The author concentrates the majority of the text to setting the stage, discussing events leading up to and following the outbreak of the war; but then does a credible job narrating the battle itself. His prose does tend to be a little ""purple,"" from time to time (""angel of death,"" ""happy camper,"" and ""spit-warm ditch water"") but it is a fascinating tale, replete with colorful characters. Decent maps and well done orders of battle compliment the text. His bibliography seems a bit padded to me with Ken Burns and American Heritage thrown in with the more often seen ""Jennison's Jayhawkers,"" Castel's ""Sterling Price,"" and Tunnard's ""3d Louisiana."" A few too many secondary sources to suit me, personally. Nonetheless, good intro volume before purchasing Piston's or Bearss' volumes. I would also recommend following this work with ""PEA RIDGE,"" by Shea and Hess."
2,looked great on amazon but...,"Ok, I bought this as a gift for sister who became a first time mother after a long battle with infertility. It looked great here but once I received it not so much. First I will say that the seller has no tracking, so you have no idea when you will get your package. When I received it finally, I was disappointed because it came to me all DIRTY. I had to go to a local jeweler the day before Christmas to get it cleaned, while the pendant is nice the chain could have been a little bit better. Also the card they show in the picture with the nice poem was NOT the card that I received with it, the one I received had nothing to do with it. I would NEVER order from this seller ever again."
3,The final track alone is worth the purchase,"If you like traditional hymns done the traditional way (with choir and organ), this CD is a good one.A typical hymn-sing, but a great recording of it. This isn't your grandma's choir.The arrangements aren't too flashy, but the final selection (""All Hail the Power"") makes up for it, and will knock your socks off.An ardent fan of Fred Swann's, I'd recommend this CD to any hymn-lover."
3,"Packed with information, written for Britian.","I found the information in the book clearly presented and in a good format. I found the book interesting reading and informative. However, it was written in Britian and some information as far as varieties, dates and insects may not apply to United States. I'm not sure, which creates doubt about the accuracy for us."
4,"Nice, but better for Britt's","This book is full of useful information. It it written by a British author for Britt's and British climates. If you can extrapolate, and use metric units, it's a nice book."
3,Short on Herbs,"Agree with earlier reviewer re: book written for Brits, not US audience, but that doesn't make it a show stopper. If you're new to vegetable gardening the book's still worth a look.....there's lots of good general information that's well organized, easy to reference and to the point. For anyone wanting to get a good overview of things, this is a good place to start.Unfortunately, the Herb section doesn't start until the very end of the book and is very thin on content. The author should stick to vegetables and retitle the book or do the necessary diligence to the herb section (and present in similar format)and republish. No way I'd say he's an herb expert with what he's presented."
2,Not what I was looking for,"Lots of information, but none of the information I wanted. This book is a good reference for Great Britian but for the US it is kind of obsolete."
2,Deceitful advertising,"The charger was advertised, like the original, with folding blades yet did not come as such, but like the cheaper versions advertised for less on Amazon. This is deceitful advertising. Received no reply from the reseller after mentioning the issue."
4,I Can See You!,"Both a red and a blue translucent binocular has provided hours of enjoyment for two inquisitive little boys. Who cares which end one uses for the eyepiece - not them. This was definitely a worth while gift for Christmas. Sadly, it failed the drop test from the second floor to the foyer. Another one is already on order."
1,Very Poor,"Very poor construction, optics are awful even for a kid's binoculars. I bought a small pair of Bushnell binoculars instead at lower cost. They were much better as would be expected from Bushnell. Don't bother with these."
2,Crude Construction - Near Zero Image Magnification,"I bought this product for my 4 year old granddaughter. Even though these are a $15 toy item, expected they would provide a noticeably larger image and be easily adjusted. However, by turning the focus adjustment from on end to the other, I could see no difference - same small image. In addition, the minimum eye-to-eye spacing is large for a child. I needed the minimum adjustable spacing to see through both sides at once.The binoculars are made of a translucent plastic and include a hard, milky colored semi transparent case."
4,THIS IS SO STRONG IT WILL OUTLIVE YOU,THIS ITEM IS SO HEAVY DUTY YOU WILL NEVER BUY ONE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THAT THE CHEESE IS A LITTLE TOO BIG FROM THE HOLES.
4,From an Avid Reader,"I thought this was an excellent novel. The detail in the book made the images come alive in my mind, and the characters were well fleshed out. They were the kind of people that are actually walking around, far from perfect yet incredibly compelling. They were just far enough away from the fairy tale story that one minute I would side with one, then the next, I would be behind another. I found myself rooting for everyone, even when I knew perhaps there was no way everyone could come out on top, especially with all the love triangles. I would reccomend this because I think it reminds us that sometimes we think we know our own hearts, and others hearts, but really, we just need to keep searching, and listening to what really is going on inside of ourselves. Anyone that has been in love, been out of love, been lonely, been scared, been through that soul searching kind of moment will be able to identify with these characters and this story."
1,"No, no, no and no again",WXP crashed after installation...hardly ever restored computer when removed that card....
2,"Barely OK, should have been a 40-page booklet, never a book","I have read about 50 books in the self-help genre, most of them contain important, valid, useful information. However, most of them could also be condensed to a booklet. Yet, a booklet wouldn't profit as well as a full-length paperback. Consequently, concepts relatively simple to comprehend are over explained, drawn out, and result in fluffing up the page numbers.Living in the Comfort Zone is the worst example of this stuff-to-fluff type of self-help writing. Valid points, especially the bulleted lists were helpful and informative. But a whole book? No way.Read it if no others are available and you need some general pointers, otherwise go directly to Better Boundaries (Black & Enns)."
4,Really cool but could be better!,"This is a really cool video if your an American DBZ watcher. Yeah they cut out some violence and Blood but it still makes for a great video, I would really recomend this Movie to anyone who truly enjoys DBZ and wants to create his own Namik saga."
3,Someone's student film?,"I watched the documentary to the end but would not watch it a second time. To my knowledge I have never met a person such as Lord Byron. His way of being was new to me - articulate loafer exploring his new interest in religion as he interprets it while cavorting with other's money and property as well as affections. The subject did not engage me, but if a first film, good enough production."
5,The couple Gieseking - Mengelberg add some important issue!,"The piano concerts of Rachmaninov are well written pieces though they lack of immortality thristy .The interesting point to remark is the added cosmic breath inmeresed in the purest romantic tradition and that is why the result is surpprising and convincing .You have to Rach in another level . Gieseking makes use of all his skills and Mengelberg the King of Rubato is an excellent support .But if this was not enough you have the Concertgebouw the second best orchestra in that moment -1940- giving such amazing playing . From the woodwinds to the percusive section , strings and metals .Welcome then to an original reading of these both concertos .My favorite are Richter - Wilowscki of the late fifties and the unique and passionate version of William Kapell in a live performance not released before in 1953 ."
4,snake,"Eve defied death twice nightly-except Sundays-onstage in her act at the Wigwam, a Trekkersburg nightclub. But when Eve died suddenly it was backstage, in her dressing room."
3,Half good. Literally.,"I aquired this CD for reinforcing Spanish vocabulary. The woman that sings the Spanish songs does a good job and my children enjoy listening. As for the woman singing the songs in English, she has the most nasal voice I have ever heard in my life. I've almost broken my foot running to my stereo to fast-forward through the English songs! An intolerably bad voice. I recommend getting the CD, then burning yourself a copy MINUS the English half of the disk. That's what I've done."
5,Ole for Dr. Jean,"My grandkids love the Dr. Jean CD's. This is the second one I have bought for them. They are only 22 months and love listening, singing and dancing to the music."
2,Poor poor reference,"As a knowledgable C++ programmer, I bought this book in the hopes of having an end-all reference manual. What I got was an excellently indexed book of mistakes. I've never seen so many errors in descriptions, examples, and usages as this book has. I've even found instances where a description for a call was an exact duplicate of an earlier call's description (cut and paste) but had nothing what-so-ever to do with the call it now described. I managed to give it 2 stars only because it is accurate MOST of the time."
1,useless book,"The title should really read ""Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 master reference"". My immediate impression is, it is going to be obsoleted as soon as Microsift release VC++ 7.0. My questions are: 1) Is it really worth spending over 1500 pages just to show all the syntaxes? like the same auther does in his other useless book ""Visual Basic master reference""? 2) Can the author writes something a little bit of more valuable to readers in the world?"
5,Joe Budden's debut CD!,"This CD is tiiight! My personal favorites are #1, Pump It Up, Pusha Man, U Ain't Gotta Go Home, Walk With Me, She Wanna Know feat. Lil' Mo, Fire feat. Busta Rhymes, Ma Ma Ma feat. 112, 10 Mins., and the bonus tracks: Real Life In Rap and Porno Star which Joe Budden says a swear word over throughout the verses. It's nasty. But it's good. Not for younger people fo sho. Cop this album, Joe Budden is awesome!"
5,Excellent,"Joe Buddens Debut album is a definite winner. This album is excellent. This Cat has been thru it all, Hes taken every possible drug their is and has survived. Budden's flow is tight and the production is solid, Just Blaze and White Boy really put down some nice beats. I Think Def Jam made a good decision when they signed him, hes gonna be a great commodity to them for years to come. This album only has one thing wrong with it, the last song Porno Star may seem alittle out of place but its all good cause its a fun track. He represents everything thats good about hip-hop and more. My favorite tracks are #1, Pump it up, Pusha Man, Walk With me, Survivor, Fire, Ma ma Ma, Focus, Stand Up Nucca, 10 Mins, Real Life in Rap, and Porno Star. If u dont have this album go get it. This is also great if ur tired of listening to ...Nas and Jigga."
2,2 stars for 2 songs,joe budden disses g unit. lloyd banks outsells him in one day tells the story really joe budden is dropped by def jam lol lol
1,dis album sucks,da albums pretty kewl at 1st but when u listen 2 da songs about 5 times they get sooooo anoyin so 4 u guys hew didnt git dis album i reckomend 2 keep it dat way.
4,excellent album,"this album is a collector's item for a true hip hop fan. There are several good songs on the album like Pump It Up, which is a hyperactive song that is hot and Fire whis is just the same but only better with a collaboration with Busta Rhymes the rest i rate#1- 4 stars- talkin bout what happened back in his old skool daysPusha Man- 3 starsU Aint Gotta Go Home-5 stars- i love this one it's hotWalk With Me- 4 stars-talkin bout his personal lifeShe Wanna Know- 4 stars- takin bout how his girl wants to know everythin that's goin on his lifeSurvivor- 3 starsMa Ma Ma- 4 starsCalm Down- 4 stars-talkin bout how he his mom ruined his lifeFocus- 6 stars- THIS ONE IS THE BESTGive Me A Reason-4 stars- talkin bout if you wanna war, you got itStand Up Nucca- 3 stars10 Mins- 5 stars- although it's actually 10 minutes long it's a good one to keep you listeningReal Life In Rap-4 starsPorno Star-1 star- completely pointless but funny"
4,4.5 STARS,"Joe Budden has one of the top rap cds of 2003 with this one. I picked it up because I liked the song ""Focus"" and was surprised to see how tight the rest of the album is. Every song on this album has a great beat, most of them provided by White Boy. Joe gives you everything with some street songs and club bangers. He has a good flow and even better lyrics to go along with it. There's no way anyone can be disappointed with this album. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the two bonus tracks are terrible but luckily didn't hurt the album too much. My favorite songs are:FocusWalk with MeFireCalm DownCome on people and buy this album. It's truly a sleeper that's worth picking up."
4,Dont hate on this release,"joe did a good job even thow everybody hated him after like 3 plays of pump it up nether the less you cannot deny joe's talent for lyrics he may not be the best but dont front on this cd its goodFavorite Track:Porno StarGuests:Busta Rhymes,112Flow:8.5 of 108 of 10 lyrics 7 of 10 beats"
4,Consistent album,"I'm givin this 4 stars, b/c 5 stars means it's perfect...& it's hard to make a perfect album. I am really feeling this album. Joe is able to flip different styles, his lyrics are actually worth something (not the same ol ""my chain cost 250 dats why ya hoe wit me""..) , beats are hot. Only songs I'm not crazy about are ""she wanna know"" & ""porno star"". Joe shines on the deeper tracks- ""Walk with me"" & ""calm down"". I would love to hear more songs like this from him b/c this is where he truly shines. Jow has lived a crazy life, & he is able to relate all that to the listener. Great first album..very promising artist."
5,Joe Beezy.....So Sick,"Joe Buddens' new cd is off the hook! I got it yesterday it's all I've listening to. I like it because it has a variety of songs. It has hype songs,serious songs and it has love songs.Joey is one of the best underground rappers,now that he's mainstream everyone will know how serious he is. personally I think he's betta than 50 but thats just me.JOEY ""SO AMAZIN"" IS HERE!"
4,Joe Budden Is Fire,"What do you know about Joe Budden. This Jersey City native jumps off his debut album with authority. He comes at you with meaningful lyrics and precise beats . With the club bangin tracks like ""Pump It Up"" and ""Focus"" to more personal tracks like ""Survivor"" and ""Walk With Me."" Some of my personal favorites are ""She Wanna Know"" featuring Lil' Mo and ""Fire"" featuring Busta Rhymes. Joe Budden demonstrates all the different capabilities he has as an artist. If you are looking for a new cd to blast in your ride this summer you should check it out. It's a definite album you should have in your cd collection."
4,Nice Album,"When you see Joe Budden on MTV or BET, you don't get the real Joe Budden. Don't get me wrong, songs like ""Focus"" and ""Fire"" are nice songs for the clubs, but it isn't what Budden is really about. A good majority of the album is about Joe's life coming up and becoming a rapper. Mixed in are some club/party tracks, but where the album really shines is when Joe puts aside the ice and bulls*it and raps about his life. I'm hoping he doesn't sell out like many of the Def Jam artists have after putting out a pretty good debut album. If you want to listen to Budden for his beats and club songs, don't buy this album. But if you want to actually listen to his lyrics and see into his life then pick this album up.My 3 Favorite Tracks:10 Mins.Walk With MeStand Up Nucca"
2,Flawless? Try MOST OVERRATED,"I'm not gonna waste a lot of time with this one, cause it's obvious Joe Budden didn't take the time to make sure his debut album a good one. I think he's comin' out w/ an album this year, but if he doesn't use different producers, his rap career will pretty much be over. I'll tell you right now, there are 3 and a half good songs on this cd-the Just Blaze produced ""Pump It Up"", the Lofey produced ""10 mins."", and the White Boy produced ""Focus"". Stay WAY away from this album, cause Budden's producer White Boy does 95% of the tracks, and does a BAD job with all except one. He is one of the worst producers around, and unless he's under an alias or somethin' right now, it's no wonder why he hasn't produced another track. On the plus side, Budden's a decent mc, he just needs his beats to that much decent too."
2,"OK, but way too overated.","Joe Buddeen's CD is a prime example why I think hip-hop is going down hill. For real, lyrically Joe Budden is a below average MC. He has some alright flows on some tracks, but nothing great. Some tracks are worth downloading, but that's about it. I gave it two stars because if it was the last rap album on earth I'd maybe listen to it again. Joe Budden has potential to come up with a better CD than this, but I think not because he is just at the moment overhyped."
4,all around good cd,I listened to every song and it has nice beats and good rapsmy favorites are you aint gotta go home and pump it up and porno star
5,A most definate buy,"This album has brung hip hop back to the way it was. Fill of life experience and pain, Joe Budden has expressed himself deeply. Tracks like ""calm down"" ""walk wit' me"" ""10 min."" are the struggles he goes thru/been thru. Tracks like ""focus"" ""pump it up"" ""fire"" are strictly for the clubs. He's bringing you the best work right now. Hot club songs, real/pain music. Summer bangers... whoa! ""Ma Ma Ma"" and ""She Wanna Know"" are off the chain! Can't forget ""#1"" where he brung it back to the good ol' days. The kid is only 22 and been thru so much. Best in his age bracket. Streets #1 Draft Pick! It's time Jersey came back... he's doing the thing for JERSEY CITY!"
5,The industries true troubleman!,Jump off Joey is a lyrical beast but people with tone deaf ears keep him under rated. Joe goes hard and makes good music which he always had. Now that he is with slaughterhouse maybe he should get the respect he deserve. why does he need 3 other dudes and feminem for the masses to approve of him?
5,OMG,This kid is seriously the future of rap...or at least what i hope the future of rap will be like...the whole album is hot...worth all my money...i copt it like a week after it came out...its been almost a year still listening to it...
1,No,"To all the people saying this is ""this the hottest release of 2003 wow!!1!!!!""...Please.People saying this are either:A) Only listen to the radioB) Just started listening to hip-hop 2 months agoC) Just started listening to rap when 50 cent came outorD) Extremly stupid.Should I say there is no wrong answer?Now before I leave, heres why this album is wack.""Pump it up! Pump it up! Uhh, yah, pump it up!""Like HOW MANY RAPPERS HAVE USED THIS LINE BEFORE? Completly unoriginal garbage. EVERY beat on this CD is just straight luke-warm-piss.His lyrics sound like Justin Timberlake backwards, and his flow is a mix of 50 cent/Krazie Bone (I love both of them, but I think you get the idea, the two just dont work together)Everything on this CD is over-hyped-mtv-pissed on trash. Nuff said.and PLEASE stop saying this is the best album of 2003 - How much more IGNORANT can you get?"
2,Lame-Thought It would be better,I've been listening to Joe for quite a while now and this cd from all his other stuff is lame. Don't buy this album and i'm not joking. Definitely not worth buying only a couple of good songs ... Joe come on man.
2,What ... is this?,"DO NOT BUY this album. In the case of Joe B., there's nothing to back up the hype. Joe Budden stayed underground all these years for a REASON. I'll give you five reasons not to like this album1.He sounds like a drunk Rocky2.The beats is [messed] up3.His rhymes is weak. WEAK!4.Sure pump it up was [great]! , but one song aint gonna make you the best, plus it was made by Just Blaze5.Busta,Kelly, 112, Lil Mo's ft.'s are great - if you block out JoeJoe was OK underground but just doesn't have what it takes to have his own album"
1,come on people,"It is hard for me to believe that this guy is actually considered a rapper, and even harder for me to believe that people actually think he is good.The dude can't rhyme, plain and simple, his idea of rhyming is ending every line with the same word, du du du playa, du du du playa, or even just repeating the same line over and over, theres some house in this house, theres some hoes in this house.When he does try to rhyme, it is embaracing.Hip hop is in a state of 911 if this garbage is considered good, PLAYA"
1,"wet, hot garbage","This CD is straight garbage. When I heard the first couple of singles (Pump it Up) I thought the kid might be on to something here. But the rest of the cd was wack. I think Joe has a decent rhyme style, but the songs on this cd don't flow at all. Save you money and buy the singles instead of wasting your time on this."
1,PUMP PUMP PUMP PUMP IT UP!DO MY THING LET ME DO..JUST JOKING,"I'm really sick of music that sounds like this.The raps on his songs are pretty weak,they make me want to go to sleep,the number of people who enjoy this should be few,Budden never goes onstage without ten members of his crew.I haven't heard all of this CD nor would I ever want to. It sounds like the type of rap that used to be out around 8-10 years ago (like early EPMD) where rappers would just string together words that rhymed together and try to rhyme as fast as they could like some kind of rhyming machine with nothing to say. Another reviewer compares Budden to fifty cent, but 50's got way more style in his delivery and better rhymes."
2,A below average album,"After listening to the Joe Budden album twice I was dissappointed with it more than anything. I didnt like the intro but when #1 came on I thought that was a hot track. After that Pump it Up came on and after hearing it so much its still on fire. I had to skip Pusha Man but I came back to it later. You Ain't Gotta Go Home was catchy and infectious as ever and Walk With Me was...nah I wasn't feeling it. She Wanna Know and Survivor were okay but Fire with Busta on it... that was a hot track! Ma Ma Ma was a song that either you like or you dont and I did'nt like it. The album started getting better with Calm Down. Because after that we got blessed with Focus which is the best track on the album and Give Me Reason which is a pretty good track. Stand Up Nucca, 10 Mins,and Real Life In Rap were all hot tracks but why did Porno Star have to be on here?Anyway, there are a handful of great songs on here but the cons outweigh the pros and you end up having a below average album."
2,joe budden,"is average at best, has no real insight into anything of any importance, it seems like he's not trying on most of his songs, and his flow couldn't drown an ant...tical03, mean you da wannabe gangsta ha? only three reviews are this, 50 cent, and jay-z, 3 wack mc's who don't deserve [anything}""the ignorant take the truth to be hard""famous quote by me"
2,Disappointing,"The first single (Pump It Up) is a great tune, but it's also played out. By the time this record dropped I was already pretty sick of it. But I figured there'd be more to like on the CD. Unfortunatley, there's not much. The production is cool at times, but mostly generic. And Joe occasionally spits some seriously wack lyrics (""Things are complicated like Avril Lavigne said it be"" ...yikes). That said, there's a great tune on here called 10 Minutes that's almost worth buying the CD. Almost. And the rest of the CD is not without its moments (like when Busta murders Joe on the track Fire). Overall: disappointing."
4,Check it.,"For a debut album, this CD is hot! Budden has proved that he's more than just a one-hit wonder on this album. He has songs that range from club hits like ""Focus"" to mellow jams like ""Calm Down,"" a touching track about his mother. There are also amazing guest spots on the CD from 112, Lil' Mo and Busta Rhymes. The track with 112, ""Ma Ma Ma"" has an awesome R&B vibe to it. If you're looking for a new hip-hop CD with sounds from R&B to hardcore hip-hop, I definitely recommend it."
4,from rehab to studio,"This cd is hot, the best song on the album is Fire with Busta Rhymes nice track. Next song will be Pump it up another great song, hypes you up, Give me a reason is another hot song, Ma ma ma with 112 is a nice track too, Calm Down is a slower type of tune but joe does a good job. Porno Star tune Joe talks about dicks and pussies hahahah funny song. the only pointless song on the album is 10 minutes, I dont know what Joe thought when he did this track they lyrics are good but tooooooooo long. Overall the cd is hot, cop that shhhhhhhhh."
1,Did not work at all,"I bought this replacement blade for my laube speed feed trimmer, it's the correct size and model number but it looks just slightly different from the original blade, the teeth are just a bit wider. So I'm about to leave on an emergency trip to visit family, I put on the new blades to trim my angora rabbits since I'll be gone quite awhile, and they don't work at all! They barley take off any hair! Not sure what the difference is but I'm very dissapointed!"
2,Pretentious,"Before I go further, I'll state that I like 20th Century, favorites being Hindemith, Martin, Messiaen, etc.. That being said, Scelsi's piano music sounds to me (and I've listened to other piano recordings in this series) like something anyone can do - just fuel up on whiskey, get very depressed, sit at a piano, and start semi randomly making a deep (deep as in pitch - not the level of profundity) slow rumbling at the keys, with the occassional hysterical outburst. Good sound, very nice documentation."
2,I returned it.,"It was too short and not the right color, but also was obviously cheaply made. Not surprising, since it was very inexpensive."
5,A Well Written Story.,"This was only the second books I've read by this author, and plan to read more. The story was well written with great characters. A constant page turner. Make sure to also read, Maggies Beau"
1,not enough songs,"just not good, after a while it all blends together and you get sick of listening to it ..."
1,"STAY AWAY, FAR AWAY!!!!!!!!!","For the two weeks I had use of it, it was a nice laptop, good design and features. I thought I was also buying Toshiba reliability, that was a joke.Of the six weeks I have had it the last four weeks it has been in for repair. They could not find the problem after I was watching a DVD and it started to stutter then shut down, and would not reboot. The repair center said that the cpu has been on back order, and have no eta for delivery. Called customer service and they will not replace the laptop as it has been over thirty days. The next call is to the state attorney general."
3,Kleer Vu Photo Wedding Album,This album arrived dirty and unkept. I suppose it does it's purpose of holding photos....
3,It's cute,"It took long to recieve it. It took 3 weeks to get it and I had to contact the seller to what the deal was, they didn't contact me. Not very professional."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"Sleek. Stylish. The angled look is really good. It is quick too, and easy to use. However, the toast is considerably darker on one side than the other. Also, the effect is mottled. English muffins toast much darker at the top than the bottom. I'm still looking for a under $100 toaster that makes nice, even toast, time after time."
4,A total success!,"A thinking man's horror film that will chill your bones. Brilliant and spine-tingling. If you're a fan of supernatural thrillers, this is the film for you. Best I've seen in years."
4,great story!,"Glad they subtitled this movie, as it was very well made, great plot line and well acted.I give it a 4 star"
1,Not impressed,"I wanted to buy this movie for a long time because it looked scary,and after I did,I was sorry.I was totally disappointed in the acting and story!The movie brings nothing new to the table,it starts promising,but then it's a total hit and miss. I got tricked in getting it by the fact that in the description,it was compared with""the Devil's backbone"" which is an amazing movie.""The Appeared"" doesn't even come close to it-one of the worst""supposed to be scary""movie I've ever seen!But this is my opinion,of course,feel free to watch and judge for yourself."
3,Greetings from Catalogna,"As far as horror movies are concerned, Spanish new wawe is doing good and this ""aparecidos"" is not an exception."
3,Spoiler,"At 11 minutes in, the license plate on the back of the old green car is the same as on the old beat up pickup truck later on. Only the numbers/letters are reversed. Clever."
1,terrible,I don't know what the other reviewers were smoking. This movie makes no sense and is nothing than a giant waste of time. Spare yourselves.
4,Good product,"Frontier product has always been reliable. The bag of turmeric had a small tear in the side of the bag and the supplier put a piece of scotch tape over the tear to keep it from leaking, which I was a bit skeptic about. All in all the turmeric is working well. I am putting it in capsules and using it for pain."
5,Exact,"Came exactly as described. It's great that it's in a dark metallic bag, but a reseal zip-top type would have been a really good help. Would absolutely buy from this seller again."
2,The book is ok,"Nothing special, but there are good pictures and the moulding profiles are helpful. The quality on the other hand, is garbage. I owned my copy about a month when the pages started to fall out in large sections. One of the poorest quality books I have owned and I own a lot of books.For that reason not recommended."
1,waste of money,If you want to see the trim work pictures just google it so you don't have to spend your money for couple pictures.
4,Ideas Galore,"If you're doing trimwork but have never spent a lot of time looking at various ideas out there, this is an excellent book to get your creative mind going. There are numerous variations of trim possibilities within these pages. But the best thing for me was the pages of molding profiles showing the various types and styles of molding available. Not all of it is available in my market, but it gave me ideas for molding I could make using my tools. Overall a really good book - I keep it by my bedside and go through it regularly just to create new ideas for trimwork."
4,Bedtime prayer,"The Christian ""Liturgy of the Hours,"" or ""Divine Office,"" includes prayers for various times of day. This book is a slim, inexpensive paperback of ""night prayer,"" which is said just before going to bed. Night prayer includes a psalm or psalms, another short scripture reading, an examination of conscience, and various prayers and verses that are used every night (so after a while you'll probably have a lot of them memorized). Night prayer is the shortest and simplest of the daily offices of the Liturgy of the Hours. It can be said in about ten minutes, either alone or with others, and you just flip to the day of the week to know what prayers to say, referring to the appendices to choose a penitential prayer and an antiphon to Mary.If this book isn't available on Amazon, you can get it from the USCCB Publishing web site."
3,Low Price with Quality to Match,"I bought this belt as a ""stop-gap"" until I could find a better one, so I wasn't expecting much in the first place. However, after two months (thus un-returnable to Amazon), the buckle is separating from the leather. So, I purchased a reversible belt from Nordstrom for twice the price and noticed the leather was more supple, with better color, plus Nordstrom lets me return it at any time, for any reason. We get what we pay for."
3,Looks good but not particularly durable,"I bought this belt nine months ago and have worn it almost every day since that point. The brown color has cracked where the leather passes through the buckle and is beginning to peel, exposing the black leather underneath the coating. The rest of the belt looks good, with reasonable amounts of wear to the buckle."
4,very informative,This book was very informative. One of the better books Ive seen for Biology. I was very impressed with the explanations of things in the book.
1,DO NOT BUY,"It is shameful that this is even sold on Amazon. This copy is NOT the real Oblomov! It is a basically useless, abridged version that chooses to omit all of the interesting parts of the novel. I tried reading this to just get a feel for the novel; it is impossible. It is cut to the point of being nonsensical. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, go order a real copy from elsewhere."
3,One use only...,"bought this product to save having to send my Wii off to Nintendo and spending more money and time... the product was perfect to take the Wii apart, but when i re-assembled the Wii the screwdriver tip was bent when tightening the screws. i expected more but i cant complain too much, it did save me money and i would probably buy another if something were to happen again."
3,"Work fine, I wish material where better",I used at my GBA and WII and works great! - Even at the CARD os the GB'S and some cellphones as well :)
2,The product I received looked nothing like the one pictured.,If you buy this do not expect the item pictured.Also if you buy this do not expect to take apart more than one Wii. The screen driver was stripped about halfway into dis-assembly. This is from LIGHT use.
3,good tool,liked it ok was hopping would last longer than it did to take screws out. probly would refer to other people
4,item is fine but doesn't seem new,"I ordered the screwdriver and received it in a short amount of time. The first problem was that it arrived in a thin plastic padded envelope with no packaging (ordered through Amazon but was bought from one of the ""sellers""). The biggest problem was the condition of the screwdriver. The handle was dirty and the shaft and tip of the screwdriver had some substance on it that was rust like. The screwdriver didn't cost an arm and a leg but was advertised as new and isn't. You get what you pay for I guess."
3,Cleaning the inside of your Wii?,"I bought this hoping to open up my Wii and fix SSBB... It serves its purpose perfectly but be warned that once you get the Wii open it is VERY hard to find the laser, if that's what you're buying this for. I ended up sending my system into Nintendo anyway; even after I cleaned the lens with alcohol, it still didn't play the game - save yourself a lot of stress and give Nintendo a call."
4,Enjoying them,These are well made and comfortable shoes. They are a bit heavy and the laces are very long but I'm sure they will serve for many years.
2,Not like The L Word,"This was advertised as being like The L Word. I disagree. The story line was boring. Also, reading the subtitles was difficult because the spoken language is so fast."
1,Not what it seems,This is probably the cheapest film I've seen.It has nothing to do with chicks on chicks. Just not enough kissing or they just didn't have the time to show both girls in bed.
5,Very Useful as a Refresher Text,"This is a fantastic book to supplement your class learning. Author John Lichen has taken care to minimize the wear of hakamas in the illustrations and this really makes it easier to study the positioning and movement of the feet in the techniques described. This book is one of the better technique manuals out there and would be of interest to more than the Aikido student. If you study classical jiu-jitsu or hapkido/kuk sool/hwa-rang-do, you'll find value as well."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"The movie itself is in great shape so no problems there. I was just not all that impressed with the movie itself. Jeff Fahey looks a lot older here and not up to a standard of acting that I have seen him in previous movies (Wrangler and Lawnmower Man) I guess this movie just seemed a bit unreal to me. I know that truth is stranger than stories most times but there was just something missing in this flick. I can't put my finger on it...maybe the script and the acting. I will give this to my daughter in law who is much younger and maybe she will like this movie! It just didn't hold a lot of suspense for me or edge of the seat nail biting drama. I think it needed a bit more ""grit""! The young girl playing the step daughter did the best acting of them all! I am maybe a hopeless romantic and want things to turn out good or if they are bad...make them REALLY bad!"
5,David Langley is Nashville's best kept single,"If in Nashville on a Wed or Thurs night, check out David Langley at The Millennium Maxwell House Hotel. Better still, buy this CD to enjoy David while waiting on your trip to Nashville. David is an unusually talented singer and musician who played just about every instrument on his CD. He has traveled with Ray Price just to name one of the stars that he has played with. Not to mention Buck Owens whose band he played in in Bakersfield CA. David is one of the very few people that Buck Owens asked to record a duet with him. Buy this CD. You will not be sorry."
3,Not as powerful.,"So far, this has been my least favorite Jim Knipfel book. The others were far more effective and easier to read. This one seemed strained, as if Knipfel is really trying to mine a played-out vein. The book has its moments, and it's very much worth reading, but it's just not as well written as his previous efforts. I can still recommend it, but if you want to read finer efforts from this very talented author, go for SLACKJAW, the best of his memoir work, and THE BUZZING, his novel, which is just purely a lot of fun."
5,Very Good,"I thought this book was extremely well done.It reads like Jim Knipfel's personal confession. I van read how he has changed - from a sad little misanthropeto am empathetic misanthrope. I don't mean that in a negative way, I think Jim would agree."
1,Not Funny,"I was recommended this book by Amazon.com, of all places. The reason was, I bought the book ""Me Talk Pretty One Day,"" by David Sedaris, and Amazon said it was of a similar nature. I did not find it remotely humorous, and in fact I was very turned off by the author's interest in all things punk and destructive. I would not recommend this book unless you would read anything placed in front of you."
4,Very nice monitor at a good price,"I've had this monitor since last December and am pleased with how it's performed. It's a big beast on my desk, but for the money I didn't see how I could beat it. Prices keep coming down on flat panel monitors, and I'll eventually break down and buy one, but in the interim this is just fine. I agree with the previous reviewer that with my nVidia card I do need to do a little tweaking, and the colors are not quite as saturated as previous NEC monitors I've owned (the video card or the monitor, who can be sure?) but the text is crisp edge to edge and graphics look great.I'd definitely recommend this if a CRT monitor is what you're after."
3,"Gets the job done, needs tweaking","I bought this monitor to replace another NEC 19"" flat screen CRT monitor that started to fail. I didn't want to buy another NEC but this one got great reviews and the $200 delivered price was too hard to pass up. As compared to my previous flat screen NEC monitor, this one is about the same. Nice picture, quiet, good clarity and looks very good at high motion, high resolution games such as BF2. The monitor doesn't have the vibrance of the Viewsonic VX924 LCD but then again, the LCD can only go to 1280 x 1024. The factory default settings for this NEC monitor looked washed out. After playing around with the Nvidia display properties, I was able to get a very descent picture. All in all, a good monitor, not the greatest thing ever, but definitely acceptable."
3,Very Quiet,"The monitor has a very nice picture and sets up as fast as you can plug in a couple of cords. However, you had better have some headphones or else a separate speaker, because this unit doesn't have a built-in speaker. I suppose it's a case of buyer beware again, but it just never occurred to me that the thing would be silent. I use headphones a lot, but my wife doesn't, so I don't know if we're keeping this monitor or not. The description could have been a wee bit clearer concerning this aspect."
3,Confusing descriptions,"I'd ordered this on April 12, and I wish Monte Wilson's review had come in just a bit sooner ;) ...I too thought I was going to get two 5 pound ankle weights but was a bit annoyed when two 2.5 pound ankle weights came in. It's also misleading when Pencil Pusher left his/her review saying he/she can adjust the weight in increments of ""1/2 pound increments"". At a glance you can see each strap has 10 rods, which led me to believe, 5 pounds each weight. Nope! It's actually 1/4 pound per rod. Wrong product!"
3,Okay,"These are okay, but the strap is in the middle and doesn't hold them on very well - lots of sliding onto your ankles. Independent straps at the top and bottom would have worked better."
4,I laughed and then I didn't,I liked the first CD a lot. It kicked was hilarious. This is one amazingly disturbed man. But because of that he's so funny. His family stuff is the best. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because of the second CD. It wasn't really funny. It was more of an interview. Bill Zehme just kept ... up to him. Although the Sinatra Story on the second CD made me cry it was so funny. Its worth the money. I suggest getting Lewis Black's CD. That is funnier.
1,NATIONAL AUDUBON WOLVES DOCUMENTARY - BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I RECEIVED THIS VIDEO TAPE VERY PROMPTLY, HOWEVER, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE VIDEO ITSELF. EVEN THOUGH I RECEIVED THE TAPE IN GREAT SHAPE THE CONTENTS WAS VERY OUT-DATED,DRY, AND UNENTERTAINING. I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY CLASS, BUT I WILL NOT BE SHOWING IT. IF I CAN'T SIT THROUGH IT, THEN NEITHER WILL THE KIDS. I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED ANOTHER ONE FROM NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC WHICH IS SUPER."
5,Item for Review: Is My Baby All Right?,"I had this book back in June of 1977! I had it for 12 years, in fact and lovingly wore it out! I really like how the book was mapped out! It told of the introduction in which a family whose 3rd child was born with Down Syndrome-to the development of a normal baby-then covering what can go wrong and why: Genes & Chromosomes, Pregnancy and Birth & then dealing with the individual disorders described in this book! The case histories of the children with these disorders sounded just like a story! It made for enjoyable reading! If a family is concerned about their child-particularly in the prenatal period, I'd recommend this book! Granted I am a single woman but I'd been born myself with a congenital birth defect:Congenital Hypothyroidism! It made me aware of other families who have had to deal with the reality of a child born to them with a developmental disorder!"
5,June Jacobs line is AWESOME,"I got to sample the June Jacobs line while I stayed at the Signature in Las Vegas... I loved the shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and soaps so much that when I got home I ordered the products! I have a problem with rust in the water lines which deposits it on my blonde hair...The clarifying shampoo/conditioner removed it all and left my hair looking awesome. I also love the scents available. The lotions worked great in the drying heat of Vegas, and the scents I love."
5,"""What does it mean to be a Conservative Jew?""","Compiled by Neil Gillman (Aaron Rabinowitz and Simon H. Rifkind Associate Professor of Jewish Philosophy, The Jewish Theological Seminary of America), Conservative Judaism: The New Century is a informed and informative collection of anecdotes, testimonies, black-and-white photographs, and more covering the history of Conservative Judaism, its interaction with the Reform and Orthodox branches of Judaism, its influence within the nation of Israel, and a great deal more. A highly recommended addition to personal and academic Judaic Studies reference collection and supplemental reading lists, Conservative Judaism is a welcome and extensive history and combined with individual insights providing as thorough an answer as possible to the difficult question, ""What does it mean to be a Conservative Jew?"""
3,For corporate controllers on a mission ...,"Just because this book was written to justify Arthur Anderson's best practices business doesn't mean it's not useful! Mike Hronec does a good job of making a case for developing appropriate performance measurements and sketches an outline for a robust process to get you there. Actually putting the plan into action is another story. Nonetheless, corporate controllers should read this book, if only to promote thinking about how effective their organizations' performance measures are in improving performance. Adam Lefton (adamleft@webspan.net)"
3,"Quality gibberish, but very insightful despite itself.",I think this book has the potential to be a New York Times #1 Bestseller if it would only change the subject matter completely.
3,One year later,"The zoom is brilliant, but the camera has some irritants. In very bright light, which is usual lighting conditions in South Australia, you need to take control of the exposure, because it will wash out the colours. In low light (ie needing a flash), you have to take control of the focussing. And every time you replace or re-charge the batteries, you'll need to turn off the stupid start-up/shutdown sound effects - if you prefer your photography to be subtle."
3,Feature information is incorrect,"The feature information for this camera states it is powered by two CR-V3 battery packs and recommends you use 4 AA NiMH rechargeable batteries. My camera arrived today and inludes the recommended batteries and a charger, so save yourself the cost of purchasing them separately."
2,slow autofocus - not great for movement,"I got this camera because of the 10X optical zoom and the good reviews. I have two kids under 4 years old and I knew digital cameras would have trouble with them b/c of their (the cameras, that is) slow shutter time relative to film SLRs, and based on what I'd seen using other people's digital cameras. But I got the C-750 anyway. I sent it back after a week. The autofocus was unbearably slow, even when set in 'sports' mode, with or without flash. The pictures were often either blurry or I missed the moment because of the slow speed of the camera. A digital camera review web site I read ranked the C-750 as 'slower than average', and I would say that was also my impression comparing it to relatives/friends cameras."
5,No Other better camera,"I am owning this camera since 2005. Recently I bought ""Canon S5 IS"" having a very good market reputation but C-750 picture quality is lot better than my new camera.The only problem with this camera is high start up time and small LCD. It would have been one of the best non-SLR camera if Olympus had continued the model with a bigger LCD screen , higher Mega Pixels and manual focus capability."
4,this is a great point and shoot camera,"I have had this camera for years and I am buying a back-up because I also put this camera in an underwater housing. This camera takes great pictures. I have been selling pictures taken with this camera and the first response is, ""you must have a really good camera"".Cons, it is a bit big and you can't just put it in your pocket and go."
4,"A great camera with excellent image quality, hard to replace","I had this since 2003, I agree with jemaerca's detail assessment. Owing to its size, I was looking for a smaller replacement camera and failed miserably. I purchased several Olympus and Canon for the size (w/bigger LCD) but all have terrible/noisy image quality. Currently still searching.I decided to write this because the C-750 produces pictures easily comparable to my wife's 2 other 8M+ digital SLRs with expansive add-on lens. She was amazed at C-750's image quality when she was testing/comparing her Canon EOS 30D + $1K+ lens. Although our family owns several digital cameras, the C-750 remains the one that takes the most pictures (indoor/outdoor, vacation,...) in our family today.It's too bad that Olympus does not extend this product line, its SP-550uz is bigger/heavier and we don't need another digital SLR. It would be ideal if the C-750 is half its size with a bigger LCD."
4,An Interesting Narrative,"I truly enjoyed the book Memoirs of Chaplain Life by William Corby. Father William Corby, a Catholic, served as a chaplain to the Irish Brigade in the Army of the Potomac. Corby relates the many trials and dangers that he suffers over his three years of service. He tells the stories of narrow escapes from the enemy fire. He ministers to the men, ""hears their confession,"" and often dose duties not required by his being chaplain. The book gives an interesting look into the religious life, as well as everyday camp life in a Civil War Army. I will say that the book is hard to get through, but it is worth the time to read. Father Corby is an interesting character."
5,An excellent read for any historian....,"Memoirs of Chaplain Life: 3 Years in the Irish Brigade with the Army of the Potomac is written by Father William Corby, a Catholic Chaplain. I found this book to be an excellent book for my research because it really showed how life was from the perspective of a non-combatant. I just loved this book because you just know that Father Corby is pulling real life into it and everything just makes feel like you are actually there. Some parts are not exactly exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat, so it's definitely written for someone who loves history in every sense. I just love reading about when Father Corby gives general absolution to the Brigade. So moving and awe-inspiring.Should be a required read for anyone who truly loves history, the Civil War, the Irish Brigade, wants to be a Chaplain, or loves their Irish heritage.Fág an Bealach!!!"
4,The dark side of K Hand,"This album from Kelli Hand represents some of her darkest work (as the title suggests). Taken from her Detroit surroundings she has chosen to represent the Detroit Techno scene with in its minimalist front It is somewhat similar to early Robert Hood (Internal Empire), or lighter work by Claude Young. There are no tracks on this album which represent her more housey output. In fact the album has barely any audible vocals at all, except for the opening track which repeats ""get ready for the darkness"".That being said it is not as dark as the deep work of Plastikman (Consumed), but that is certainly no fault. Definitely recommended to those who enjoy the incredible techno scene straight out of the motor city."
5,I Thought it was a true story,"I had to read the jacket to find out that it was just based on a story. See this is what I am talkin about. Here you got a down south, redneck, uneducated white boy. gets in trouble goes to jail, escape from jail, lives in the swamps for months, comes out goes to college gets a degree, not just any degree but a law degree, who motivates him, a black man. who helped him to go to jail, in the first place, a black man. who does he go back and help to get out of prison because he shouldn't be there in the first place, a black man. and who are the crooked people who set him up White police officers. Only in America can this kind of stuff happen. that's why I thought it was real."
1,Not Accurate!,"I returned this scale. It was not accurate. Every time I would step on the scale I would get a different number. It wasn't just a slight difference, it could be a few pounds and this was within a minute of each weigh in. I wasn't impressed."
1,Terribly inconsistent,"The scale is light, easy to read, and nicely cushioned for bare feet. However, my weight changes greatly depending on where it is on the floor, and whether or not I lean a little. First thing this morning, I found that I lost 40 pounds from the night before! A few minutes later I had gained back 8 pounds, and after my shower another 30. Maybe I'll take an average."
2,Georgia Bulldogs Two-Sided Flag,This is two flags put together. It will not fly because it is so heavy. When it rained the flag was so heavy it damaged the flagpole. Maybe it can be used on a wall.
4,Excellent!!!,"When I first began to read this book, I didn't think I was going to like it. How wrong I was! The more I read, the more I liked. Simon and Jorie are terrific together. It would have been nice to have other characters fleshed out a bit more. But there is only so much space in a book and I'd rather have devoted to the h/h relationship.A lovely book to read by the fire or at the beach."
5,Gear motor works great,The delivery was fast and the motor wiring instructions were clear. It worked perfect the first time.
5,Deeply Inspirational,"Sometimes, when you're just clinging on, it helps to be reminded why. Ray Boltz is a master extraordinaire when it comes to speaking to our hearts and souls, strengthening the bond between our Lord and Savior, and ourselves. Always, I pledge allegiance to the Lamb, with all my strength, with all I am."
5,Inspirational,These songs deeply impressed the true meaning of Christianity. Now my love for Christ has a deeper intimacy.
4,New News,"Excellent quality -- picture, sound, etc. Very interesting take on this particular bit of our recent history with viewpoints and insights not previously reported in the news media."
5,Sarah Palin Should Be Proud!,"If there is anything that has made me change my opinion at all about this woman, it has to be this movie! Julianne Moore nailed it, like always! As much as I do agree with how most people feel about Palin, I have to say this movie made me feel kind of sorry for her. They should have left her alone. She was doing okay as the Alaska governor and then she gets thrown into the campaign and she becomes 'unstable'. Or she already was. What I realized after watching this film is that Palin WAS just like any other god loving woman in this country. They say that money or power can change a person. Maybe in this case, the power she gains shows who she truly is? Hmmm."
5,Game Change,Awesome movie! It was so wonderful to watch. I've seen it three times already. Told a lot about how campaigns are run.
5,One of the most important movies you will ever see,"In someways this movie surprised me--I'm no fan of Sarah Palin and never will be, but this movie is so well done that you can understand how and why the 2006 Republican campaign was doomed to fail. Julianne Moore's range is amazing. Her performance is spot on giving you the sense of someone who is almost at the same time as fearful as a caged animal and foolish enough to believe their own press releases. This behind the scenes look at the dark side of a political campaign very nearly makes you feel sorry for some of the people caught up in the wake of history, leaves you angry at the political players who dared to carelessly gamble with the fate of our nation and thankful that the so called ""strategists"" over played their hand."
5,Very entertaining...,Julianne Moore surely nailed it with her portrayal of the stereopytical Alaskan Hockey mum and the clueless turmoil than ensued her being chosen for VP in McCain's 2008 presidental campaign !!!Very good acting from Mr. Harris & Harrelson !!!Watch it !!!
4,Great depiction of current politics,This is an example of our current state of Politics. Moore's Sara Palin was as good as Tina Fey's I was intrigued by it.
4,Game Change,"I love HBO movies, in general, and I looked forward to renting this when it came to Amazon. Overall, a good movie. I have no idea how accurate it is. The acting was superb. At no point did I feel like there was a bias for or against Sarah Palin. This movie made me really feel for her, even though it was her decision to jump into this high stress, high profile position as VP candidate. The movie lacked something for me. I don't know what it was, exactly. There's just something about it that makes me not want to leave five stars. I would recommend this movie to others."
2,Interesting and eye opening but pretty boring.,"I thought all of the actors were great and the movie was very interesting from a political stand point. I actually have more respect for Sarah Palin now. But ultimately the story was boring, predictable. I'd recommend this as a rental not a purchase."
2,Story line was cute but the acting was awful,I really like Woody and Julianne. But this was defiantly not their finest moment. It was so over acted that I did not feel I was watching a move but a bad community theater project at the old folks home. All I could think is that if this is the movie I wonder what the bloopers reel looks like. Woody I know you can do better.
1,Leftist Hit Piece !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is nothing but a Leftist hit piece on Sarah Palin ! The media in this country is our greatest danger to our LIBERTY. What A freaking joke.
1,Worthless polemic.,"I would call this film a slick hatchet job, but the clumsy over-the-top writing makes it anything but slick. If you enjoy Bill Maher's vile, misogynistic, and far-left claptrap, you'll leap for joy and kick your little heels over this fetid helping of pond scum."
1,Utter garbage!,Why this show received rave reviews is beyond me. Perhaps there is truth to the left knee-jerk approval of anything that demonizes Republicans. Beyond drivel!
1,Liberal bias and lies don't waste your money,This movie is nothing but liberal bias and lies. Don't waste your time and money. It's sad that a lot of people will watch this and think this is how things really happened they won't even check to see if any of it's true. Sad and pathetic.
1,Completely false and decietful film!,"This film is supposed to be historical in its context yet it is far from that. Much of the garbage in this film is built on liberal lies about Palin, Republicans, and conservatism. It is quite a shame that so many people are so stupid and ignorant; indeed, those who believe this liberal trash are bordering on automaton morons! It is unfortunate Hollywood didn't opt to portray Palin in a more accurate manner, but this is Hollywood we are talking about. After all, they did win a Presidential election--twice!"
5,A memorable book,"William Langewiesche is an excellent writer with eyes and a mind that miss little. ""Sahara Unveiled"" tells of his travels, by land, south from Algiers on the Trans-Saharan Highway and west across the Sahel to Dakar. It is also a tale of Algeria's Islamic revolution, the Tuareg rebellion, and the Sahel's extreme poverty, all told through encounters with locals along the way. For me, the outstanding feature of this book was not the physical journey across the Sahara. Rather, it was the chance to meet the Saharans as modern people, our equals, making their way through life the best they can in unforgiving circumstances."
4,Interesting & Abrupt,"Northern Africa is generally not easy to learn about. There just isn't that much information out there. When I ran across Sahara Unvieled, I found it to be a very interesting travelogue. Not a place I would want to go! Only problem with this book, though, is the ending: It just stopped, mid-stride. It ended about two chapters too early."
5,Desert reflections from a great non-fiction writer,"I became interested in this book when I read an excerpt in The Atlantic--the macabre section on people (usually Europeans) who lost their way in the Sahara and died of thirst has stayed with me ever since. For example, there are names for the stages of thirst that are based on the liquid you're willing to drink, descending from urine to gasoline and antifreeze. Not all of the book is like that, of course, but that's the kind of detail that Langewiesche has at his disposal. He makes you see and feel the desert. You learn about the Sahara in all of its beauty and ugliness. Some passages remind me of Ondaaje's The English Patient, they paint such a forceful picture of the landscape."
1,Poorest Of All Books,Do not buy this book. The author rambles from one thing to the other attempting to convince you he has a brain. I think he bumped his head on a low limb. I have never read a poorer attempt of a book than this.
3,As a travel/adventure book it's ok...,"I got caught up in the hype over this book. Bought it. It's an OK book... but not much more. Maybe if I hadn't been caught up in the go-go and then came face to face with reality I would have enjoyed it more. First of all the book is short. Small and short. I was expecting a big book with big adventures, big gripping stores and/or lots of pictures. Wrong. Second, the author comes across as a bit snooty--not a lot, but enough. There was more than one occasion I didn't particularly care what he thought, did, or where he was, and I wondered ""Why am I reading this??"". Yet, there were other times when I was on the edge of my seat.So, if you've got the $$ and the inclination go ahead and buy it. But if you don't have either, ah, forget. You really won't be missing all that much."
4,Energizer batteries but not in the same packaging as pictured.,"These batteries were a great price and value for the money. I don't mind that they were taken from a bulk package and sent in little bubble packs, but I think it should have been noted in the description on Amazon."
4,It's just batteries.... they work if the proper type... what else can one say?,"They work. They arrived fast. Many stores don't carry this type, and they may be hard to find in smaller towns..."
5,Good for Hexbugs,Great price and last long for the little Hexbugs that my son has. And the best part is Energizer is made in the USA
1,Product was not as described or pictured.,I ordered the energizer 357 silver oxide batteries and was sent some maxell alkaline batteries. For most products the maxell replacement would work fine but not for all and I was disappointed to get a totally different battery than I purchased. They have already offered a full refund but it is a major pain and will cost me shipping and time because of their screw up. I appreciate their willingness to make it right but the product should not be falsely advertised.
1,Did not work,"What you get in the mail is NOT what is advertised! The batteries do NOT come in retail packaging as pictured. They are packaged in shrink wrapped foil strips. The batteries that I received did not appear new. They were tarnished, not the usual smooth shiny batteries one gets in when purchased in the retail package. Batteries failed to work after 10 minutes of use."
2,Did not last long at all.,"We used these in a baby book (one of the those press the picture it makes a sound models). The book took three batteries and ate through them in one week. Not sure if it was the book or the batteries. We have similar books that last for months, so I assume it was a bad set of batteries. Buyer beware?"
4,Great Value!,purchased these batteries for my daughters books with the sound buttons on the side. these are expensive to replace and most people ditch the books as soon as the batteries die (hence we bought them used in that condition). this was a bargain since the stores around me were charging $10+ for 3 batteries. very happy with purchase and my daughter gets to enjoy her books again.
2,Still waiting for batteries - 357BP-3,"Ordered Aug 3, and indicated delivery by Aug 12...it's now Aug 18 and no sign. Just dropped an email to MTA. Hopefully will get good(!) product soon....I'll post another review if/when I get the batteries. Not encouraged by some of the other reviews but I'll keep an open mind......"
4,Good price for batteries,"The price was good on these batteries, but they were near the expiration date. The voltage is good on them, but not sure if their age will affect their longevity."
1,"Got the batteries, but they're ANCIENT","Batteries weren't in a retail 3-pack as shown on the product page. Instead, I received three batteries ""clipped"" from a larger wholesale pack... which would be fine, except that we're in 2011, and the date on the back of the battery packages is 2004!! Obviously battery life will be lousy, since they've already been sitting on the shelf somewhere for SEVEN years.Looks like somebody dumped a load of old batteries on the wholesale market, and MTA trading picked them up cheap and is slipping them back into the retail chain (at retail prices).I'm sure MTA wouldn't still be selling in the Amazon marketplace if Amazon knew they were selling old/surplus merchandise, and trying to pass it off as new."
1,Items received did not replace A76,"Ordered 3-pack and got 3 individual batteries with different packaging. Package on Amazon states this battery replaces the A76. The packages I received did not state that. Needless to say, they didn't replace A76. Thanks a lot MyBatterySupplier."
2,Incorrect fit information on the package,"I hoped to use these for an electronic Thomas the Train book. The book uses AG13/LR44 batteries, and these Energizers say on the front of the packaging that they replace AG13 button cells. Unfortunately, the batteries are too large to fit the book, even when forced. It seems like another reviewer also had trouble with fit."
2,no juice,"batteries arrived really fast, however they seem to be low in power. I used in my lazer and when i first turn it on its bright for like two seconds then dims away. I will need to find something better."
4,Our 1 year old loves it,"He played with one of the books in this series every day for three months. I only wish the build quality was better, as the sliding pages sometimes get stuck, and then it's hard for him to move the pages."
4,Color-Changing Baby Book,"A Mini Magic Color Book: Farm Animals (Magic Color Books)This small, cardboard book is part of a fun series for babies. There are at least 20 different titles about pets, sea creatures, dinosaurs, cars, jungle animals, baby animals, bunnies, Christmas, the Baby Jesus, and more. The pictures begin in black and white outline form, but when readers pull a tab, the picture turns colors! These are very simple books that can be viewed and/or read, depending on age. I gave these books to a child with autism who does not like to read. Not only does he enjoy the Magic Color series--his therapists think that they are excellent and use the books in therapy!A Mini Magic Color Book: Sea Creatures[[ASIN:1402712081; A Mini Magic Color Book: Jungle Animals (Magic Color Books)]]A Mini Magic Color Book: Cars; (see others, too)."
5,My son loves this book!,"I got this book from my Pastor's wife, my son is 1 year old, so he's a little small for it's recommended reading age of 4-8 years. However my son just LOVES pulling the animals out to see them in their colors. He has worn this book out, it's not really meant for his age so it won't hold up to the abuse that a 1 year old can dish out. I am buying one as a backup for when he gets older."
5,Adorable interactive book!,I decided to try this book even though I had never heard anything about it. However my daughter (19 months old) loves it. It is very interactive and kids love that you can pull out the animal and the colors appear. I since have purchased the other mini magic color books. I took the book to nursery with children 18 months to 3 years old and all of the children loved it! I highly recommend it! It is a great price also!
4,"Great for quick, creative gifts!","If you like to make gifts for people but don't have a lot of time to spend making them, this is a nice choice. I certainly would try to find a less expensive, used copy though. I'm glad to have the book but I wouldn't spend $20 on it. But it is loaded with great ideas for small gifts."
5,great short read,great read for the gangster in me. and shows that people can change their life around. everybody in jail is not guilty.
2,Almost Awful,"This tape supposedly consists of the BEST girl/girl vignettes Playboy has to offer, which if it were actually true would still not be saying very much. In fact, what it actually contains is Playboy same old-same old.. girls of varying ""quality"" doing generally nothing with each other set to bad electric guitar background music. Sure, there are 2 or 3 scenes that MIGHT actually hold you attention (the ""legendary"" sisters shower scene) but by and large this effort is typically high on nonsense and extremely low on actual erotic sapphic content. For example, there is no actual kissing in this video (ok.. maybe 1 or 2 QUICK pecks, but that is IT!) I don't know who directs or produces these Playboy efforts, but they need a transplant of imagination. The cover, as usual, is hotter and more creative than 95% of the tape!"
2,"As usual, Hef and Co. fail to deliver","Playboy's latest shameless attempt to cash in on the current explosion of lesbian erotica contains, what a surprise, little to no erotica, just like the Girlfriends series. If Playboy actually produced a video with entirely new footage of this kind, in which they expanded their boundaries somewhat (could we at least see girls KISS?), and starred predominantly playmates, it might be worth it, but this pretty much sucks. As enticing as the title sounds, don't buy it; it's just recycled crap which is very far from erotic, except for one or two sequences. Trust me."
2,A disappointing DVD ...,"This could have been a great DVD, but unfortunately, it ended up being a disappointing mishmash of older Playboy videos, with no segment longer than 2 minutes.I've seen some pretty good Playboy scenes on other DVDs, like the 3 girl massage scene from Girlfriends, or the Jacqueline Lovell bedroom scene in Freshman Class, or the full body massage from Sex on the Beach. None of these were here.What good scenes it did have, they were re-cut and shortened from the original video where it may have appeared, like the car convertible segment from Blue Collar Babes. The original segment was maybe 3 or 4 minutes long, but it was 1 minute here. Jacqueline Lovell's segment from Hard Bodies was 6 or 7 minutes long, but abbreviated to less than 2 minutes here.I'm glad I only rented this one. Save your money, and get the full-length scenes from the DVDs where the segments appeared in their entirety."
2,even less thrilling Playboy,"A lot of guys usually knock Playboy titles for not being explicit enough, but I prefer their ""softer edge"" -there's plenty of hard core material elsewhere. Still, ""No Boys Allowed"" is not only tame, but fairly boring as well even for Playboy's standards. Even the bonus material (approx. 20 mins.) featuring Playmates cannot save this title.This review refers to the video tape."
2,"elevator music, anyone?","what is usually great about playboy is the music that accompanies the babes. This dvd--not so. Real boring. Music has little beat, and neither do the girls. Wish I read Amazon ratings before I bought this..."
5,We love Curious George!,We own all the Curious George DVDs and we're waiting for more. Our daughter is thoroughly smitten with that monkey and she's picked up quite a few things from him. I like the creativity and problem solving in every episode.
1,I'd pass on this one.,"Deacon John is a marginally gifted session guitar player, but is way out of his league as a leader/vocalist in the context of this concert. He apes for the camera and comes across extremely insincere and disingenuous in the worst way. Don't buy into this crap - not when there is real New Orleans music that needs to be heard. One star! Not for Moore, but for the stellar accompaniment. Maybe they can figure out a way to bluescreen him out. Here's a guy (Moore) who used to play Hendrix-like (except that he never really learned to tune a guitar), and he's skippin across the stage with an umbrella. Only thing he forgot was the blackface. He's much less talented than his brother Charles, who plays in the band."
2,"CERVANTES, LECUONA, ETC.","Again... Zayas is a good piano player, but I do not like the way she expresses herself on Cervantes, Lecuona or the cuban music. I need more than a good piano player. Interpretation is very important to me."
3,It's a capacitor,It's a capacitor. The only reason you need to buy these is that caps in the value needed are hard to find.
2,AC Adapter gets Hot,"It does cool to 40-41 degrees as advertised. There are two problems:1. The AC adapter gets hot during use, almost too hot to hold. This is not good, and was alarming enough for me to send it back.The adapter does not look like the pictures on the web, and is labeled 'Caution: For Use with Technology Equipment'. What? I don't think this is techology equipment! It *is* rated 12v 5 amps, however.2. The fan operates continuously and emits a distinctive pitched tone (469 Hz), rather than whir. It is loud and can be easily heard indoors from a distance of 20-25 feet. I found it disturbing. No doubt it would be fine in a car, but I intended to use this mostly indoors."
4,It gets the job done!,"I recently took this unit on a cross country trip and was pleasantly surprised. It chills cans rapidly, but is sort of an odd fit for bottles. I didn't feel the sound of the unit was at all a bother. It emitted a low whirring sound that I did not even notice when the radio was on. It came with a 3-in-1 12V converter which was incredibly convenient, but unfortunately broke on the last leg of the trip. The unit never failed, although!"
1,Does not contain 200mg of potency,"I have used three different brands of coenzyme Q10. I primarily take it for the increased cardiovascular benefits. I normally get cold feet as the blood flow does not adequately reach the area. By taking Q10 from Natrol or Naturemade, my feet are once again warm and life is good. I tried this brand and Bam! instantly back to cold feet. Its as if I took nothing at all. Problem with Herbs and Vitamins is that their potency is not truly standardized. I would not recommend the swansons brand for this reason. In my experience the potency was not up to par for something I regularly notice. If I was taking this for something I would not notice (such as a heart condition) then I wouldn't have been able to see the non-posative effects. I will stay with Natrol or Naturemade brands from now on."
2,The start of an upward trajectory,"The good bits - Branded and Exiled itself, title track and heavy metal monster, laying down a vicious artillery barrage in preparation for the assault onto the listener. The next good bit, the somewhat diverting Mordor - which alas is in the middle of the album after proceedings have been stunted by a few densely constructed wedges of proto-metal. The third and last ray of sunshine is a lumbering tune that closes out the album - Chains and Leather. Presumably the band have a sense of humour to do a song like this and when your final song on a disc is this cool, well it makes a punter be somewhat forgiving of the lead weighted metal they have staggered through to get to it.This is a band that eventually grew up and away from music this dense, preferring a more cutting technique which allows the songs to breath more. But that came later."
5,A Great Biography,An all-emcompassing book for fans of Louise Brooks. It has interesting stories and beautiful photos.
2,Go for a tripod stand instead,"I've seen a few of these before I ordered one. When it works, it is a good, solid product that can hold multiple guitars in a small space. However, the legs on the one I ordered are uneven, the welding between the parts looks shoddy, and the whole thing wobbles-- not exactly the piece of furniture that I would trust with holding a few thousand dollars worth of instruments. I'm returning mine and opting for tripod style stands, which are stable on any floor surface."
2,Meh...,"- It expensive, you pay a lot for what you get.- Assembling it is easy.- After a month of light use, some rubber parts have broken. Not very good quality.- Meh."
1,"shockingly poor construction, probably used before--stay away","While I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the order arrived, I was quickly disappointed. The packaging was shoddy, hinting that I may have been handed a previously returned item. As soon as I was done assembling the base, I realized it wouldn't work: the holes in the metal parts were so badly aligned, and the two legs were of unequal height, that it would not sit flush on all four legs. I could have assembled the rest of it thinking to just ""make do"" with it, but why should I waste 60 dollars on a bad product. I have decided to return it asap, hoping to find another brand which has not botched this very simple product."
3,Good basic stand for the money,"The stand is sturdy and does the job - nothing fancy. The price was very reasonable. I wouldn't use it for high end guitars, however. They need more protection."
3,Not exactly writing advice,"I've been buying books about writing lately, as it has been my lifelong dream to write a fantasy story. ""Seven Steps on the Writer's Path"" is the third title I read on the subject. Perhaps I'm looking at it the wrong way, but this book doesn't really provide much writing advice.I was looking for some more practical recommendations, like the information provided in the excellentStein On Writingbook I read before. Instead, ""Seven Steps on the Writer's Path"" mostly talks about how unhappy you can be while ""on the writer's part"" and how to deal with those feelings. In all fairness, there are some writing tips, and some pretty interesting quotes in the margins, but if you're looking for some clear, specific writing advice, this isn't it."
2,A 150 page Group Hug,"This book falls into that trap of inspiriational titles- about 1/3 through you start skimming for the quotations by famous artists and thinkers. Why? Because the authors say absolutely nothing new about the creative process. In fact, they don't even seem to try.The tone is that of a kindergarden teacher: warmly encouraging bordering on patronizing.The book tried for a structure (7 steps, duh) but each chapter sounded just like the preceding one. Apparently, writing is a frustrating process. But then it gets more frustrating. And then, did we mention, it becomes frustrating.I will say that it was an easy read and if you really are so desperate for encouragement as to spend time reading self-help books instead of actually writing, then I suppose this will be the hot cocoa with marshmallows that we all need occasionally.However, for anyone looking for insight or raw inspiration, this will be one big bore."
2,"""Over"" Defense","I recently purchased this DVD at a coaching clinic. It was rather expensive, most instructional coaching DVDs are. The title says Over, I assumed it was talking about the 4-3 over defense and walking a safety into the box. I am not sure why the title includes the word over, as this was not an example of the 4-3 over defense. The description of the film states ""the DVD explains how defensive teams can employ shifts to gain an advantage"" there are no defensive shifts discussed in this DVD. I almost felt like they put the wrong DVD in the box.Futhermore several of the schemes that Johnny Burnett draws up, only have ten players. He leaves you to guess or assume where the other player should be aligned. I would not recommend purchasing this film to anyone. It was a total waste of money."
5,Always something new,"My three year old son loves this book and we read it every night. He is constantly finding new things to open, close, move, etc. After about 2 months of constant use, one of the tabs finally broke, which is much better than other lift/move books he has. Highly recommend this book!"
2,Quality not so great,"This book has a lot of neat ideas in terms of the pop-up elements, but I think it was perhaps too ambitious. At least two of the moving parts broke the first time we tried to use them and several other pages only work with some careful coaxing. I definitely don't recommend this book for little kids and I don't really feel like I got my money's worth, unfortunately."
2,illustrations too small,"I was disappointed with this book since I LOVE The Wheels on the Bus by the same author. In fact, I have put this up in my ""regift"" closet for a future desperation birthday gift with maybe a gift card to a book store."
3,"Good popups, but strange storyline for kids","I like the interactivity of the book and the variety of popups/sliders, but the storyline is so strange. I think there are a lot of other popup books with more appropriate story lines. I guess to each his own. It's very well done technically; I just can't recommend it for kids."
3,Tears too easily,"This book is very beautiful, and my son loves it, but, as echoed by other reviewers, he broke two of the tabs the first time we read it (and he is not a rambunctious, destroying type of child at all). Since then, almost all of them are out of commission. Surgery had to be done on several of them, and now those only work if I do it for him (because they are balky, like many people are after surgery). I didn't feel it was worth the money."
3,"Great game, terrible video transfer","If you are a big Mizzou fan, which you obviously are if you are reading this, then go ahead and buy it. However, the video is terrible if you are watching on a big screen HDTV. I would recommend the purchase, due to the awesome outcome of the game, but don't expect DVD quality picture or you will be disappointed."
3,The train starts moving in the right direction,"OK, this isn't the full bore metal blast of Death or Glory but you can see things starting to really develop in that direction. Conquistadores and the title track itself show that the lads are starting to fire on more and more cylinders.This is still a bit backward and it helps if your a devotee of Rock 'n' Rolf Kasparek, lead inspiration and vocalist of this mob. But even if your not you'll get decent slice of metal by picking up this, really an album that shows the band leading up to their peak."
4,Port Royal,My only wish is that I could have seen these folks in their native country on tour. On par with their fellow Germans known as Scorpions. Check them out! No aficionado's collection will be called complete without them.
3,"Running Wild's first good CD, but not as good as later CDs","After ""Under Jolly Roger"", Running Wild managed to prove that the third time definitely wasn't the charm. Their famous move from worshipping Satan to worshipping Pirates was significant in their history, but unfortunately Under Jolly Roger was far from good. Their fourth effort ""Port Royal"" sounds much more like the Running Wild we know and love today. Port Royal contains all of the great melodies and rhythyms that Running Wild is known for. However, their distinctive aggressive gallop was still in its early stages and some of the songs on this album are real turkeys. It is my opinion that Running Wild didn't perfect their sound until Port Royal's follow up ""Death or Glory""."
5,Good knives. The cords fall off pretty fast.,The cords fall off pretty fast but the knives are solid. Decent for their intended use.
2,Good and the Bad,"Though these have Hibben's name on them, they are not made well...sorta.The blade is good and well balanced, they throw great. However, the Cord on all three unraveled after only 30 min of throwing.Hard to believe this happened.Not recommenced!I would, if you like these, buy the ones without the cords."
2,Looking Good until you open your eyes,"First impressions are good in this case. Individually the blades look good but when held together one must question if the 3 blades were selected by a blind man such are the differences between them. How one can expect a consistent response from 3 such different profiled and balanced knives defies belief. Another legendary company gone to rubbish. Shame Gil, Shame"
2,"Stick with TV, Moose...","Moose was a bona fide NFL player who played during the glory days of the Cowboys. And he may be a decent TV analyst, I can't say that I've ever heard him on the air. But a writer he is not, and he should have gotten a better ghost writer than Gigliotti and where the hell was the editor of this book? I bought this (even paid the full Barnes & Noble price)thinking that it would give me better insight into being a more astute observer of the game, but the Moose fell short of this goal. He is way short on facts and data and way long on nostalgia and personal opinion. And I'm not sure that he ever gave one hint about what to look for while actually watching a game.However, on the plus side, I did learn a few tidbits, which I am assuming are true: the meaning behind the name 46 defense, explanation of the free quick rule and describing the passing tree.Otherwise this book is very basic and superficial and a serious fan/student of the game would be mostly bored reading it."
4,A viewer's guide to watching football,"Daryl Johnston, ""Watching Football: Discovering the Game Within the Game""This book provides an insider's view of the game. DJ brings his unique perspective as both a former player and a current analyst for Fox Sports, and fans are the beneficiary.More a viewer's guide to the game than a general overview, he covers basics like rules, the uniform, definitions, offense, defense and special teams.The 250p paperback is published by Insider's Guide and lists at $14.95."
1,a disappointment,"Unless you are an avid fan of Mr. Johnston, this book will be a real let down. It has little of interest and did nothing to enhance my viewing of the game."
5,Use as an Apron.,"I use this as an apron and it works rather well. It is big enough to cover and easy to get on and off. Then after cooking it just stays right on and I don't have to worry about spilling.my dinner, especially soups as I have very arthritic hands."
2,Too many coding errors in the examples,"By page 19, I had already encountered several examples that contained, not typos, but logical coding errors. Was this book edited at all by anyone? Is it really that hard to test the included code examples? Logical coding errors make me distrust the abilities of the author, since there is no excuse for writing code which any programmer can instantly identify as incorrect. Maybe the 2nd edition will be better."
4,Just read the book,"This is the 3rd PHP book I've read. In my opinion, a professional PHP programmer can find a lot of useful things in this book about serious programming in PHP. The disadvantages of the book, however, are:1. many errors in the code2. also the code is not organized very well (it is not plug 'n' play)3. the sort of difficult language (for non-English speaking readers)"
5,Celiac Disease Illuminated,"This is a well written book by an author with a clear and orderly mind. She illuminates the subject, celiac disease, with compassion and a dynamic understanding of the condition and the science of it. Her metaphors are helpful and she puts her knowledge into everyday imagery we can all relate to and visualize. For me, this is the best that an author with specialized knowledge and training can do: make it available and understandable to all who read it. I also found it refreshing that while Dr Lyons refers to available testing, she did not make her book all about marketing/spending your money with medical doctors. She includes information about celiac disease not available elsewhere. I am grateful that she took the time to write this volume and I have already benefited from reading it."
5,Excellent Book,This is an excellent book that I would recommend to any one who may or may not know what Celiac disease is!
3,Photos?,I want to buy a book with photos of Lautrec's Moulin Rouge posters. I cannot tell from the review and lack of book info on site whether there are photos in the book. Will not buy.
4,Small earrings - not top quality - inexpensive so they work,These are okay for the price. Just not my favorite earrings.
5,A Literate Bridget,"The fad of sad-sack single gal books has almost run its course, because the majority are poorly written, redundant (ie anything by Jane Greene, et al) and witless; no we don't need another reference to Jimmy Choo shoes (wild) or tears in the pint of Hagen Daes. Kelly Cherry, unlike her competitors, is an actual poet and a literate writer who can reference allusions beyond the Brady Bunch. Though this can look, from the surface, like just another swingle's love lost book, it's a beautifully observed, poignant and poetic look at what it means to be human and feel deeply."
3,Far fetched,"First of all the plot to this is unrealistic (I won't spoil it by giving it away). Secondly, not a lot happens. The writing is long winded and tries to be stream-of-conciousness, but I just found it tedious. There is a part two thirds of the way through in which the SAME scene is told from the point of view of four of the protaganists, which served no purpose I could see. Maybe the author should stick to poetry?"
5,Definitely the BEST up to date,"This might be a biased review, because I proudly regard myself as THE Hillsongslover(well, certainly in South Africa)This is the most amazingly wonderful album by Hillsong Music to date. The Praise and Worship is sooooooooooo anointed and I can't get enough of it!!!! The Potter's Hand will be my all time favourite - it's even more powerful to me than SHOUT TO THE LORD.Their newest album, By Your Side has already been released here in South Africa. I have a ""warning"" The feel of this album is entirely different, but it is bound to be a special one. I love it. Look out for the wonderful ""FOREVER I WILL SING OF YOUR GREAT LOVE"" by Darlene Zschech. The idea of this new album is to bring the new generation of writers into it. GREAT nonetheless.TOUCHING HEAVEN CHANGING EARTH is HIGHLY recommended and every song makes it feel as if the price is a rip off for the retailer.In short GET IT!!!!!!!"
2,WHY?,I LOVED THIS BOOK UP TO THE VERY END. THE ENDING WAS AWFUL I JUST WANTED TO CRY. IT WAS LIKE WATCHING A MOVIE AND THE POWER GOES OFF NEVER COMES BACK ON. WHERE IS THE LOVE? WHERE IS THE MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND SON? WHERE IS MY HAPPILY EVER AFTER? PLEASE PLEASE WRITE A NEW ENDING.
1,Frustrating & Disappointing story,I've read a number of Susan Wiggs' books and enjoyed them but this one was a tough read. The characters were not believable - supposedly bright people that did really stupid things. I almost didn't stick with it but I did and then the ending was just awful. Story lines left hanging and a totally non-believable and abrupt conclusion.
1,Less than spectacular,"I've been plowing my way through my library's collection of SW's books and I've enjoyed them all so far - except this one. Emotions were mentioned, but not explored. Some of the writing was repetitive and irritating. The whole thing was just not that great. It had the potential to be outstanding though, had she spent the time then that she does now on character and plot development."
1,Worst book I've read in years,"I bought this book after someone recommended Susan Wiggs and I have to say, this title was the worst thing I have read in recent memory. Stupid characters, with every cliche in the book, and ridiculous squabbles and jealousy. Not worth your time or money."
3,"A must-see for Jodi Ann fans. For the rest, move on.","Jodi Ann is a fine-looking Playmate, and fans of her will delight in the heaping helping of vignettes that feature her every curve. Highlights include Jodi Ann skampering around in a cheerleader's outfit; in a mansion being bathed by maids. The rest of the disc is typical Playboy fare. For those seeking a little variety, check out Playboy's excellent 'Playmate Calendar 2000.'"
5,Jodi Ann Paterson DVD,"Well, there is no doubt that this is a must buy DVD. Although somewhat choppy on the scenes it give it keeps viewers from getting bored. If you are a Jodi Ann Paterson fan THEN this is a MUST buy!"
1,Disappointed,"Based on all the positive reviews here, I expected a good movie. The actors, direction, cinematography, etc. are all good, but where's the story. It is like half a movie with a beginning and middle, but then the movie is over. The credits rolled and my wife and I looked at each other saying, that's all? Boy, we have better things to do in 2 hours than watch a silly film. I am disappointed. Can I have my 2 hours back?"
2,the ending is such a disappointment,"many of the french movies were ended up very disappointingly. this 'cache' translated into an english title as 'hidden' was none better. after an intensive storyline, the end simply ruined the whole thing. what's going on? what's the way of thinking of these french movies screenwriters and directors are way beyond what i could have comprehanded. there were so many french movies ended up like this one: going nowhere. it seems that all the endings were rushed mindlessly and carelessly. all french movies' endings are just like nissan/infiniti's cars, with ugly and ridiculous rear ends, no matter how those cars' fronts looking so cool, the rears are always designed so ugly. french movies are just like nissan's cars, they've spent 95% creativity and inspiration to make their movies look so great from the beginnings, but they always failed to deliver satisfactory endings. what a shame and regret."
1,Total waste of time,"There was nothing even remotely interesting about this movie except the beautiful French language. It was too slow, too blah, and the ending was dismal."
1,Hidden-Guaranteed to Leave You in the Dark,"My wife and I sat down to be enthralled by this sub titled movie on a cool and rainy spring afternoon. What a hugedisappointment ...why... the subtitles just don't keep in syncwith the screen dialogue. The actors are talking for minutes at a time but the translator was apparently on lunch. So, if English is your language then the plot and point of this movie is well........hidden. Might be a Coq D'or (Golden Hen) movie in France. It's a turkey in Australia. Nough said."
1,absurd,The characters do all those things kids in slasher movies do. Logic goes out the window. Lies are told for no good reason. Personal guilt is overplayed.
2,Much Ado About Nothin',"Starts out with a lot of suspense and mystery. The story progresses very slowly and this bores you to the point of not caring anymore. After the second half the plot fizzles and the ending is abrupt. So so performances by the stars. A good idea, executed badly."
3,hidden is right!,"Everything about this film is hidden: plot, motive, story, purpose.One can surmise how the next two hours are going to go when the opening credit sequence is simply the film of a surveillance camera. That goes on for a full five minutes, and there is rarely much more action than that.We discover very little about any of the characters or why they behave as they do. Aside from two brutalized Algerians (symbolic?), no one is even remotely sympathetic. The film does bring up, very obliquely, some nasty aspects of French history, but to absolutely no effect.I stuck out the full two hours because the film does have a certain Gallic style, and I really wanted to find out what actually happened in the past (which seems to be the only point of the film).I didn't."
4,Haneke is a major new voice,Cache may not be as astounding as 'piano teacher' or 'time of the wolf' but it does captivate its audience in another psychological puzzle.. and it lives up to the eerieness of the plot..Somewhere in between David Lynch's 'lost highway' and the films of the french new wave 'cache' is as suspenseful as it is interesting - and like most of Haneke's films is extremely hard to decipher.. Haneke obviously takes great pains to captivate and confuse his audience..
3,"A magnificent script, painfully wasted!","Cahe (Hidden) is a remarkable and fruitful script that failed in hands of a young director who pretends to rediscover the existential silence of Michelangelo Antonioni.A succesful young marriage is continuously frightened through sevarl VHS tapes that are recording every one of their steps and minor activities. This febrile state of tension obviously, increases to unbearable limits, but the narrative dynamic is so poor, that almost I leave the projection's hall.Think for instance, in these two clever directors: Claude Chabrol or Francois Ozon: Anyone of them could have led to a better and more secure port this film that began with so many expectatives and failed in the middle of the river.An awful pitty, because the cast was extraordinary:"
5,Superlative filmmaking,"A fantastic movie for any fan of Hitchcock or Antonioni. IMHO, people who label the ending as ambiguous have become used to American movie's tendencies to spoon feed the audience answers as if we were children. The extended takes in this movie are a welcome relief to the furiously over-edited style of today's thrillers (and most movies in general).If you need intrusive music, zoom shots or narration as a nudge to tell you how to feel or to highlight important scenes then this movie is not for you. All the answers needed are explicitly on the screen."
1,Quel navet !,"Je me suis presque endormi deux soirées de suite et c'est la première fois que je finis un film en 3 jours ! C'est dire ! Un film mortellement ennuyeux, une intrigue (?) qui finit en queue de poire et malgré deux excellents acteurs, il est impossible de trouver ce film palpitant.J'ai tenu à voir la fin du film pour la seule et unique raison que je m'attendais à une retombée phénoménale (peut-tre) et heureusement que j'étais assis, car JE serais tombé sur autre chose !!!Regarder ce film ou la cheminée crépiter, a revient au mme ; quoique la cheminée vous apportera chaleur et un sentiment de bien-tre !$15 pour ce DVD ??? Jouez plutt au Lotto. Au moins vous ganerez peut-tre au lieu de perdre votre temps avec un film aussi insipide !"
5,EUROPEAN DVD IS NATIVE,For those of you who can play back our European DVD's in pure native quality ( IE in PAL not translated to NTSC) you should note that this production was shot on the European 25 frame 50hz HD format NOT 24p/60hz. So if you own a video projector or a plasma screen and have a DVD player that outputs pure 50hz video get the UK edition from Amazon.co.ukhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000EJ9NIW/qid=1148417083/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/202-3344998-4794237
2,Hardly Hitchcock,"Anyone who expects Hitchcock suspense from this will be disappointed. It doesn't translate well into French. It's not scary and you won't be shocked, except by the suicide. It's a little too long and the moral tale at the center is quite French, so anyone else may not get it."
1,All of the good reviews are obviously by people connected with the film..,"Isn't it interesting that there are a large number of five star reviews and a large number of one star reviews?And those who say it is one star wish they could give it less... as I do. It's a movie that sets out to waste your time, that's it. Why can't we give negative stars? On all of the negative reviews, also note that one guy goes to each one of them and disagrees. Please, get a life and get over it. You created a movie about nothing to waste people's time and this is the reward. Now go write five positive reviews to counter this one.The film is an absolute failure. Read the positive reviews and you'll quickly discern that they say nothing."
2,"Slow, slower, Cache!","I always loved the movies by Haneke, and hold him as the best European director right now. I just loved Funny games (both versions). But this one I was just a big disappointment. I can understand that the idea of the film IS that the plot is supposed to be hidden from the viewer, but in the end it's just becomes boring. Great actors help to make it watchable the first hour, but then you start looking for the fast forward button on the remote..."
2,Cachet,"Liberal guilt, third-world victimology, a mystery fashionably left unsolved, the peculiar and rather Catholic idea that even a six year-old is eternally damned for his misdeeds (at least when their object is a member of a minority group)--all of this makes for a gimmicky, pious, chic and unconvincing film. Well-acted, though."
1,Long enough for a good nap!,"If too long scenes, irritating characters, unrealistic plot devices, and elementary life lessons constitute fine film making, then yes, this film is truly art. But the rest of us will only appreciate this film if they are awakened by their DVD's shutting off having fallen into a nice nap by the first quarter of this plodding bore-fest.There really isn't a story worth telling here. Save your time!"
2,Is the human mind capable of enjoying an unresolved story?,"After watching the film, I ""studied"" the interview with the director.I can see what he tried to say and what kinds of films he wanted to make,but I'm just curious to what extent the human mind is capable of handling the obscurity (i.e., not knowing who actually made the videos and delivered them to the couple). I do not think that the audience will be as cognitively active (i.e., being eager to engage in some abstract moral speculation about the protagonist's guilt over his memory or dreams) as the director wants to think. The more the audience want some closure, the worse their reactions will be to this film."
3,Hide It,"I like films that keep me guessing. however in order to do so well they have to actually move. This one moved a bit too slowly for my taste. I also think that it required a bit of insight into France's history with Alergia. That info was subtly delivered in context, so subtly that it could be easily missed, thus the crux of the film would be, too. It's a beautiful film to watch, and compelling enough in its story..."
3,Interesting Movie,This movie is for anyone who likes French Films and wants to learn more about French Culture and history. The movie leaves you wanting to know more.
1,trying,"trying is the best word to describe this movie.it tried my patience. the opening scene was several minutes of nothing and i had to hold myself back from turning the movie off. I told myself, give it a chance, and i repeated that through the entire film. somewhere with in 90 minutes I just wanted to find out what was happening and why... well i can't spoil the movie but...it tried to be artistic. in fact i think most of the people who review this movie with five stars want to be artsy. examining composition and frames and dialog and colors and blah, blah, blah. this movie was a waste of my time.the only theme or concept i took away from the film was that upper class French people are annoying."
1,"Don't be fooled, this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen","I saw this movie at a film festival event and I paid way too much money, $20 a ticket, to see the sneak preview. No one at the festival liked it. It was dry and there was only one part that shocked me and it lasted two seconds. It was dry, boring, and unsuspenseful. The ending will also confuse you and give you no resolution. We go for two hours and nothing happens at the end. It's not a creative ending it's just frustrating. If you want to see a good thriller there is a great Hitchcock collection available online and a much better use of your time and money."
1,Most boring film ever,"This was definitely one of the most boring and pointless movies I'vce ever seen. Half-baked does not even beging to describe it. I don't have a PhD in film studies, but as a regular viewer, I can't find any reason to watch this boring and needlessly prolonged movie. I want my rental fee back!"
2,Reaches way too far.,"I am a huge fan of arthouse cinema, and I was thrilled to rent ""Cache"" after hearing all the positive reviews about it.BUT-- Sadly I will have to say that I disagree with all the positive reviews. And here's why:1. Too slow (I love slow paced thrillers like CHILD'S PLAY, THE RETURN but this moved too slow and had no pulse).2. You don't even care about the characters.3. Ripoff of ""8MM""4. No music6. Too many plotholes (the Algerian guy committing suicide, which DID make me jump, but was pointless)7. Terrible camera work!!!!!8. The ""Chicken Decapitation"" had nothing to do with the story.So if you want boring, watch this. If you like tension, watch THE RETURN or Ju-On (The curse)."
1,What the f**k!!!,"My God. This has got to be the worst film I have ever seen. Why? Because its SO BORING, UNIMAGINATIVE, SLOW PACED, BLAND, POINTLESS and a COMPLETE WAISTE OF TIME. The only other reviewer on Amazon that I agree with 100% on this film is Eugene Fenlon BA. And he was even being extremely generous by giving this film 2 stars. IT DESERVES NONE! The idiot reviewers on this site that give Hidden 4-5 stars are totally over exaggerating. This film offers nothing new to cinema and its not at all special in any way. Burn this film before it wastes your time."
3,Pretty slow.,"This movie had a decent and somewhat interesting narrative, but it is slow moving, with a lot of still scenes. It's beautifully shot, though. Just not for short attention spans."
4,"Good, but what went on here?","I really enjoyed this French film. I've only seen a handful of them and find them on the whole better written than Hollywood movies. This kept my interest throughout but I must admit the ending baffled me. I really don't know why the going's on here were going on but will watch the special features soon and hopefully find out.Creepy film, shocking in some places, entertaining throughout."
2,Not particularly interesting,"The fact that the story is left unresolved isn't particularly an issue for me... In my opinion, the movie is decent, but the plain truth is that it is simply not that interesting. Of course, it is a good premise... basing a film on the human ability to deal with guilt. The writer has chosen a random and mundane situation, I'm sure intentionally, to delve into for the story, but it just isn't all that good. The acting is mediocre, the pace is painfully slow... It's just not right for everyone. I have a high tolerance for a slow-paced film that eventually leads you somewhere, but this movie was slow-paced and led me to a disappointing ending. 2 stars for the idea, but that's about it."
3,Haneke breaking down the fourth wall?,"I'll admit to being flummoxed by the ending of this movie. I did completely miss the unexpected exchange between two of the film's characters at the ending scene that others refer to here. [I did re-watch...you have to watch it VERY carefully.]There's a really great take on this movie in IMDB, where the most popular thread goes for the ""breaking down the fourth wall"" theory: that it's director Haneke himself who is making the tapes. [Remember the dinner-time discussion about the director friend? No one knew what he was up to these days. ""Some unnamed project.""] Anyway, according to the cineistas on IMDB (a heady crew), this take on things would not be out of line with Haneke's previous body of work.And, oh yeah: people keep saying there's this one gasp-inducing moment. Trust me: they're 100% right. It comes at you quickly, unexpectedly and shockingly."
3,"Cache is ""Hidden"" ... and So are its Attributes","This is a puzzling movie to figure out. It alternates between taut drama and extended periods of tedium. After sitting through and watching the entire movie, I must confess that it left me sitting, wondering, and scratching my head trying to figure out what it all meant. Maybe its French meaning is beyond me.You might be able to achieve the same level of entertainment by getting up at four in the morning and watching the TV test pattern or listening to the Milwaukee telephone dial tone for 30 minutes. It is that exciting and fathomable.Your mileage may vary, but I found this a rather puzzling and inexplicable movie."
3,A total waste of money,"the episodes are ok, But the problem is that you can see the same episodes on T.V the video version isn't uncut or anything and neither are the shows on T.V, so I'd just recommend watching the show on T.V"
5,Just read about these guys in The Sunset Strip Diaries,Just read about these guys in The Sunset Strip Diaries by Amy Asbury- it was hilarious and interesting. Got the CD and it rocks!
2,From Satanic to Pirate Metal,This german band started out as one of the more decent satanic metal bands to come out of Europe in the mid-80s and changed to pirate metal with this album.This album has better recording quality and the guitar riffs aren't as sloppy but the album just falls flat. The title song is the best song on the album and the rest is not really worth listening to. Great album to play if you're having a metal/pirate costume party but otherwise it sounds pretty silly. The pirate motif makes me think of Disneyland's 'Pirates of the Carribean' and the song would have actually been cool on the soundtrack for one of the movies.The band was ok with their earlier satanic stuff but their later pirate motifs never seemed to make them a greater success in the mainstream of metal.
5,Transformation & Empowerment at its BEST!!!,"I am owning this gem of wisdom for few years and by now whole book gives the impression of being worn out from heavy usage! I absolutely agree with all the above reviews and it is clear: every NLP Practitioner and every Astrologer would benefit tremendously from putting this book into practice. If you desire to unlock full transformational potential of Astrology and NLP, then BUY IT NOW and be ready for most exciting ride of your life!"
3,Provides useful insites to the Dow for novice investors,"""Beating the Dow"" is well organized book offering insights into the Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJA). The author provides a background summary of each of the thirty- one stocks making up the DJA.A spreadsheet approach is presented allowing the reader to analyze each stock comprising the DJA, establish a ranking of the stocks, and pick your portofolio of two of three DJA stocks."
2,"A good beginning, but somewhat outdated.","Mr. O'Higgins' ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy is necessary reading for any amateur investor. However, he really didn't get into that until about halfway through side two. Most of the tape was his musings about the current situation with the thirty DOW stocks. Unfortunately, it was recorded in 1990! The majority of this tape was hopelessly out of date. A simplified book or tape without all the discussion of the 1990 situation would be far preferrable. Still, the five or ten stock strategies he outlines should comprise a portion of every investor's portfolio."
5,The numbers speak for themselves,"Day traders often laugh at O'Higgins as their returns beat his. But keep in mind it takes a total moron not to make a killing in the market these past few years. Wait until the next recession and the day traders have all thrown themselves into NY Harbor. O'Higgins' system will still be blowing away the averages. You are a fool to not buy this book. Especially if you are a casual investor. When he says his system takes 5 minutes per year he is not kidding, and year after year his system will blow away those mutual funds you have your money in now."
3,Last and least in the GT 2000 series,"2 1/2 - 3 stars. I like these in decreasing order as the volume number increases. Vol 3 doesn't have anything really obnoxious on it. It just seems ho-hum in the selections; nothing really grabbed me and the quasi-experimental songs didn't do much for me.If you're new to the series get Vol 1 or 2 first; the former if you want a higher energy level, the latter if you'd like a mellower mix."
5,works very good,seems to be a very good product. No unusual noise back there and the truck runs smooth. I like the friction modifier being already blended in.
5,Good Stuff,"One of the better synthetic gear oils on the market per my mechanic, and also a good value. Amazon's price and service were top notch, as usual."
5,Shipped to my door for a good price; how can you beat that?,Great stuff! A little stinky but very Slippery. LOLBought on the recommendations of others. Time will tell.Very good.
1,"HORRIBLE quality, even worse customer service!!","I would rate it a zero if I could. Extremely cheaply made. The mask, costume, shield and weapon ALL broke the first time my son wore them. Costume Craze not only refused to replace it (they only have a 2-day return policy for defective merchandise), but were very rude about it."
4,"Interesting, very interesting",An entertaining read but you can't help learn something about Parisian bourgeois class homelife in the process. Plenty of intrigues and double dealings. I like how zola lets us eavesdrop on the gossip sessions of the servants in the back courtyard in order to move the plot along. The ending leaves the reader hanging somewhat. He was obiously already planning to write the next installment in the Rougon Macquart series (and this book's sequel) The ladies paradise.
5,A Great Book!,This is one of the best novels by Stephen King that I have ever read! The characters are so real and you feel like you have been in the electric chair and I loved John Coffey! It's such a page turner that I felt really caught up in all the action! The movie follows the book extremely closely and was really true to the work. The book still stands alone and is even better!
5,Horror? Nope. Not really. A great book? Oh yeah!,"This book is NOT really scary. There are some gory scenes and spooky ones, but the same goes for classic greek plays... The story is told in first person. Looking back at his life, the main character drop hints about what's about to happen as he tells the story, but more often then not the clues are confusing and misleading which is fun. But even with all of the plot twists and page turning suspense this is a very very touching book and I love every single page in it!"
5,Incredible!!!,No words exist that would do Stephen King justice after this series! He makes it impossible to stop reading. It the greatest heartstopping series I've ever read. It is truly a magnificent piece of work. I highly recommend it
2,eh,"The most disappointing thing about this novel is the reading level at which it's written. Any fourth grader would have no problem understanding this book. Not at all challenging. That bugs me. oh, and a note for those who've seen the movie and are thinking of reading the book? Don't. You'll only be disappointed. The book is a screenplay for the movie. Scene by scene. And the movie is much better."
5,This is definitely Stephen King's best book!!,"I've read this book 3 or 4 times and I cry at the end every time. It's such a great character study and such a heartwrenching story. I've read just about everything from Stephen King and with the exception of The Dark Tower series, it' my favorite. I've always thought Stephen King had an uncanny ability to see his characters and make them really believable and this is proof of that talent. However, I really don't care for the choice of Tom Hanks in the lead. I just can't see it. I was thinking someone more mature like Ed Harris. He would be great as ""Boss Edgecomb""."
5,The King rules!,"This is a wondrous book. Mystical - one gory scene, but well worth the read. You will see this is a powerful read and it will stay with you."
2,Very slow reading until the end,"This was my least favorite of all King's books. I fought thru the book for a month and then couldn't put it down for the last 100 pages. The beginning and middle was very slow reading and the story bordered on silly almost. It seems that King was taking a ""break"" from his usual scary, grabbing intense stories with a more mild story. Good for people who don't like the ""normal"" Stephen King but didn't interest me who would rather re-read Salems Lot and Carrie over and over..."
2,Lame,"There was too much sap for me. The ending was completely unbelievable. And the old woman with turretts syndrome? Please. A lame, pointless, ""get in some shocking obsenity"" ploy."
2,Help! I must have landed on the Planet Cornball!,"King lays on the corn with a trowel in this limp prison drama full of improbable situations and the tinniest dialogue ever written. Anybody expecting another Shawshank Redemption, be warned. A hulking black prisoner out of Amos 'n Andy is found to have mysterious healing powers while a bunch of dull, interchangeable prison guards chatter endlessly about what to do with him. An interminable sequence where they sneak him out of the prison to cure a terminally ill woman of cancer is sappier than Patch Adams. Seeming chapters are spent on a magical mouse with two names, after which King, having written himself into a corner, spends about a half minute to explain why the narrator, the 'bull screw' at the prison and a seemingly 'good man', would allow an innocent man to die in the electric chair. Ugh!"
3,"Good, but misrepresented","The picture shows a thumbnail of the cover of one of the six original installments. I was therefore expecting the six separate books, and instead recieved a single copy with a big picture of Tom Hanks' face on the cover. I know it's just personal preference, but I HATE getting the books that have the movie cover on them. Again, just a personal thing, but I do wish that representation had been more straightforward. Also, the cover had a relatively large tear in it, which is obviously not very cool. On the other side of things, I absolutely loved the book itself, but that's a given."
2,361 reviews and 99% ranged this book with 5 stars!!!!!,"simply unbelievable. this book seems to be an utterly successful one according to its massive brilliant reviews. not even a master piece such like war and peace of tolstoy could have such a feedback at amazon. yes. i bought this book, the #1 ny times bestseller. but honestly speaking, i felt rather disappointed after reading. first of all, the story could have be told in 300 pages,but in no means 536. and plus the plain story and the flat characters all along the way, you dont have to read past the first half to know it all. its intention of showing the readers about inhumanity of man is a bit too obvious too. and most funny thing is stephen king created a role of a black/supernatural/ innocent/holy man to solve all the problems for all, including curing diseases for the good, giving punishment to the evil and also deciding how the story shud finally end up."
5,Number ONE book in America,"This book demenstraits the ture talent of Stephan King! King combined drama with a most wounderful plot to make one of the best books ever written! The Green Mile is not only sad but it is creates such a bond between the reader and the characters with in the book. In December of 1999 there was ""The Green Mile"" movie made, this stared Tom Hanks (At His Best). This is again one of the finest movies ever made. Thanks to King, he has added so much to are entertainment world. If you have not read this book or seen the movie, I strongly recommed seeing the movie and reading the book."
5,A descriptive feast,"I held off reading The Green Mile since I had already seen the movie with Tom Hanks as well as the rest of a great cast. Still, there is something to be said for the power of the written word when it comes to evoking mental images. In this respect, King is at the top of his game it providing compelling dialog and poetic descriptions. Of the three dozen or so books by him that I have already read, The Green Mile ranks up at the top of the list -- with perhaps Duma Key being the only other title by King that, for me, achieves the same level of pure elegance."
5,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING AND MOVING,"WHO KNEW! This amazing book was written by Stephen King. I sure didn't. This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. I give it more stars, but I am not allowed that.Anyhow, once you start this book, you can't put it down. You can feel the emotions of each character, especially that of Paul Edgecombe and John Coffey. I strongly recommend this book to anyone. It will make u a believer of miracles."
4,remarkably refreshing,"I am a correction officer, I was suprised to see people in my profesion shown in a good light, except of course for the nephew. We have more of the good ones believe me. I don't ususally care for S. King in this case I have changed my mind, saw the film now I want to read the books. Thanks to the director and Tom Hanks."
5,WOW! An Amazing Book!,"THE GREEN MILE is a heart warming tale of injustice and discrimination. After being convicted of killing two girls, John Coffing, a black slave, was sentenced to death. With a secret no one knew about, Jonh felt all alone until the deathrow guard found him innocent. A book this good should be in every house. I recommend this book to teenagers and adults. It holds a powerful moral that should be shared with everyone."
5,The Most Steven King There Is,"I waited a long time before reading The Green Mile, mainly because I didn't want all the hype about the series to influence my own opinion. As usual, I wasn't disappointed by Mr. King. The Green Mile is perhaps my favorite of all his endeavors. From the tense moments watching Mr. Jingles retrieve the spool to the knot in my heart as Coffey takes his seat in the chair...I think I felt more reading this book than I've felt in a long time.I thank Mr. King every time I read his books. I relish their authenticity, their horrific beauty, and the truth about humanity that they reveal. The Green Mile touches something deep inside, revolves it around, then throws it down with a loud smack, making everyone around jump.I doubt I will read anything nearly that wonderful this summer on the beach. Painfully, I'll search. Perhaps I can bring myself to read Dreamcatcher now."
5,I love King's new approach. This book is truly great.,"This book is different from any of King's others. It is not a horror tale, but it deals with miracles. I didn't know how it would be when I acquired the first book in the series. However, though it didn't involve horror, I was very impressed. This book more than earned its place in my library."
5,FANTASTIC!BRILLIANT!,"EVERY IN THIS BOOK IS FANTASTIC.THE WAY STEPHEN KING DECRIBES HIS CHARACTER IS BRILLIANT!ILIKAD MOUSE MR.JINGLES VERY MUCH,BUT THE SCARIEST CHARACTER IS THE MADJALE KEEPER WHO KILLED DELACROIX IN MOST TERRIBLE WAY!!"
5,Spectacular!!! The best audio book I've ever heard!,"I can't think of all the good adjectives to describe this fabulous series. A real great story, read by the finest voice I've heard in audio books. A must-listen for any fan of Stephen King or mysteries."
5,It left me with an eerie feeling,"This was one amazing work. I have to tip my hat to Mr. King. If you do decide to pick this novel up before the seeing the film, (I hope you do because the novel's are usually much finer than the film) then stick with it, for it will haunt you in a way few of his other novels have haunted me after I closed the cover for the final time. It made me feel like, and I'm not ashamed to say this, cry. For a not too aparent reason."
3,medium book...,"The story was pretty original, but nothing I found VERY exciting. It was also quite obvious the book was published in parts - the ""whole"" vesion was still divided into parts, and in the beginning of each part there seemed to be a little review of the previous events, which was a bit boring for someone who's reading the book as one unit."
5,Exceeding Expectations!,"Stephen King's The Green Mile was far beyond my expectations. I hesitantly started the novel, but then I became extremely interested; five-hundred thirty-six pages later I closed the book with a sense fulfillment at the befitting ending and remorse for the desperate characters of the Green Mile. It is a great novel with great characters, written by a talented and imaginative writer."
5,Compulsive Reading,"I only knew the work of Stephen King through the movies -- this is the first novel I've read. It's a really compelling story, with a clever plot, sub-plots, believable characters and enjoyable narrative. Except for one deeply unpleasant instance the gore factor is mercifully kept to a minimum. Very interesting from the perspective of spiritual healing."
1,Boring and predictable,"I truly hated the book, which biases my opinion. The main character is not believable, and the story is very predictable -- you need not read past the first half of the book to know it all."
1,Trashy Movie,"Word up. What the hell is this. Its like a shawshank redemtion(the best movie) with no action. The movie was good, but this was just peer boaring bull. What the hell people saying its good. Overall the movie is better than the book. And Stephen King should find somthing new to do like not writting books. The only good thing he did was write the Shawshank Redemption. What. Thats what I got to say to you Stephen King."
5,The best Stephen King book around.,"Out of all the books I read in my English class, this is probably the best book I have ever read. I will give it a ten, hell a ten plus, or a ten plus plus even. I felt that I'm Paul Edgecomb. I'm the one who is the head supervisor on E block. I felt that John Coffey touched my groin to heal my urine infection. I felt like I made intimate sexual intercourse with my wife Jan all the way through the darn book. And I've seen Del fried in Old Sparkey like an over done KFC chicken, and I felt the pain of Jan's death. This book made it come alive. It is actually that good that I recommend anyone who is a Stephen King finnatic to read this book"
2,Disappointing,"I simply did not understand the excitement regarding this book. I have heard tremendous things about The Green Mile, and couldn't wait to read it. When it was put into one book, I started it with great enthusiasm. Only to be completely disappointed. Where was the suspense. Where was the surprise. Where was anything. I am a very big Stephen King fan, more of his non-horror writing than anything else. So when I heard of a non-horror King book getting great reviews, visions of Shawshank and The Body and Eyes of the Dragon were on my mind. This just didn't measure up. I am wondering if I missed something or maybe my excpectations were too high, becuase after finishing it I thought there must be a 7th part somewhere. It just lacked."
2,King at his WORST and that's the TRUTH,The only reason that I can give for submitting a '4' for my rating of the Green Mile is the fact that once again King has found a way to suck his fans pockets dry. Why did he stretch this series out only to let it end with such a weak ending? I know the answer and it has to do with George Washington. Blaine the Train is not nearly the pain that King is becoming to my bank account by dealing us such trash as this. I do however think Mr. King is one of the greatest writers of our times. I also believe he has finally become a victim of the almighty dollar and believes he's worth more than the word he writes which has got to be his biggest mistake.
4,DAWN FLANIGAN'S REVIEW OF THE GREEN MILE,THIS WAS A RELLY GOOD BOOK. I HATED THE ENDING BECAUSE JOHN COFFEY WAS KILLED. THAT WAS REALLY UNJUSTIFIED AND SAD. THIS BOOK WAS REALLY SPIRITUAL AND MADE ME CRY.
3,100% Stephen King...........,"This is not a tender hearted story. It is full of supernatural stuff, so don't be expecting anything different."
5,A great read,"I had the pleasure of reading ""The Green Mile"" in its original format; as a ""chap book"" that came out in six installments once a week (this was generally how popular liturature was released well into the late 30's) and it was wonderful--the sense of anticipating the next installment was great. I hope that Mr. King and his publishers repeat this format every once-in-a-while. Besides, all six chapters are much more collectible."
5,I always thought Stephen King's work was too bizarre.,"This was my first King novel. I read a review here that said if you have never read King begin with Green Mile. Several of my friends concurred. I am so happy I listened. From what I know, and what I have been told, this is not a typically written King novel full of gore and extreme oddities. This novel is one of my favorites and I will definitely read additional King work. He has to be the most descriptive writer I have ever had the pleasure of reading.If you are hesitant to buy this because of things you've heard about King, or you're hesitant because you have read his other works, put this aside and buy this now. I'm confident you will be pleasantly surprised-as I was."
3,Too long just like the movie,"I believe I'm a Stephen King fan, it seems I read one book or so per year,so I understand his style. That is what draws me back to him. But the Green Mile just isn't his best writing. This story could have been told in 300 pages, not 536.This is one of my major criticisms of King, he's done it before, he'll do it again. The characters seemed cookie-cutter. And why does he set this story in Alabama, we love Maine! Finally, why have so many ridiculous deaths within the final 10 pages? It was like a bad TV show that needed to end. Overall, do a re-write Mr. King!"
3,"Interesting, but Hard Reading","I must admit, that once I started the first book, I was hooked! However, almost halfway through, say like the 2nd & 3rd series had me kinda drifting off. Characters like Paul Edgecomb, John Coffey, and Brutal seemed to be the most interesting characters. And of course King did a good job on making you hate characters like Percy Wetmore and that ""Wild Bill"" But, like most of King's novels, The Green Mile seemed to have lost me at some points where it was hard to understand. But the movie enlighted me as to what he was trying to say."
5,"The Green Mile [Don't let ""King"" throw you]",Best or close to the best book I have ever read. Movie was good[real good] but the book WOW.
4,From a Stephen King Fan,When you are a King fan you begin to look for his astounding creativity. I read this book several years ago and it left me with a feeling that stuck with me and marked the experience. Only now of course do I remember the book once again after watching the movie. I vote that you read the book prior to watching the movie due to the fact that a good book lets your imagination go wild. The story will cause you to cry and feel what the characters feel. The story is entertaining and will make you sit up until 3 am with no inclination to stop till you can reason yourself to put it down.
4,The Green Mile,"I thought this book was very good and I can't wait to see the movie. I realize that the story is being told by the ""head"" prison guard, Paul Edgecomb, in his old age....but I didn't much care for the repetitiveness. One chapter would end with a certain paragraph, and 2 or 3 chapters later, the first paragraph was repeated word for word...almost as if to remind you where you left off. That aside, I thought the story was great and very creative. I heard the movie was exactly like the book...can't wait to see it."
4,Great Book,This book was amazing. The plot was great and it meant something. It was true entertainment to read that book
5,The Old Cliche is True...,"...the book is always better than the movie. I was, however, surprised by how close the book and the movie were to each other. There were some additions and subtractions.I listened to this serial novel on my way to and from work for about two weeks. I think this might be the way Stephen King would have wanted it. He mentions the role of serial novels from the past and how a person would sit and read them aloud to their family. Hearing the words allows you to get lost in the story.I highly recommend reading this novel for its storytelling genius, but I also recommend listening to it. As you listen, you will develop a deeper appreciation for the spoken word and the storytelling ability of Stephen King."
4,A Compassionate Adventure,"Not only did this book have a well thought out plot line, but it sent a valuable moral message to all that read it. Though this book has recieved critisizm for being choppy as are many serial novels, I found it to flow quite gracefully and smoothly. The character of Wild Bill Wharton was a wonderful minor antagonist. Percy was easy to hate, as he should have been. My only problem with this novel was that the protagonist, Paul Edgecombe, was not well developed. What I mean by this is we never really knew enough about his younger years and I never got a sense for what drove him and motivated him. I found him to be slightly bland and I wish King spent more time filling him out."
5,One of King's best,"This book was an extremely fulfilling, emotional and thrilling read. I finished it as quickly as ""Misery"" and was left with the feeling that I had been witness to a terrific tale. I think the racist and ethnic categorizations by other reviewers (as well as the divulging of the plot) is ignorant and thoughtless to others who might not have read it. If you can't get past the color issue in this book then you have missed the greater picture and should read it again. If you are NOT a shallow and defensive person then I think you will find that this series is a moving, unforgettable experience (although not a classic ""horror tale"")you will be glad you read."
4,The Green Mile: The 6 part serial,"This was the first Steven King book I have ever read so it was quite a surprise. I was expecting something a little more scary but what I got was even better. This series brought you to death row. It let you experience the electric chair and living with the consequences first hand and it looked at death rather lightly. All the secrets of death row are reveiled. King allows you to witness miracles happen on the ""E"" block. From the magical mouse Jingles to the hated character Percey King takes you on a trip to destiny, which sometimes means death. You will learn about all the prisoners and how they got in to the Cold Mountain penitentiary. King portrays each character perfectly. He shows you that even though they have all done something horrible to get them in there they are still people and have feelings. I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who is looking for a bold, nerve-twisting book."
5,"I am not a big Steven King fan, but this was sensational!!","After reading the 6 volume series I was elated. I thought it would make a great movie. I am so excited to hear that it is being made into a movie with Tom Hanks as the lead. If Hollywood sticks to the story without deviation, this could be King's best movie yet!!!"
5,A really good book.,"This is the first Stephen King book that I have read, and I have to say that I was really pleased with it. The book is in the first person view of the prison warden of the E-block, or the Green Mile, a sort of Death Row. He discribes life at the prison and how it changes with a new prisoner, John Coffey. Coffey seems to have an extrordinary healling power, and is fairly simple minded. He was charged with killing two young girls, but he didn't kill them. The writing in the book flows smoothly, and you begin to think of the other inmates as people, not prisoners. Del, who owns Mr. Jingles the mouse, William, the Billy the Kid of the 'row and Toot Toot, the sarcastic and joker. You also meet the Wardens, Percy the Stuck-up and annoying, Brute, a large and sometimes rough guard and Paul, the narrator. This is an excellent book and one of the best that I have read."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"This is just what the summary says, A GREAT BOOK! Stephen King really portrays this as an emotional novel more than horror to me. Almost all 6 parts have a part that just makes you feel sad for a character(s), like Mr. Jingles, and John Coffey. The horror in this novel really doesn't start taking place until 'Night Journey', but it is still a good drama, and even somewhat mystery. I can't wait to see the movie!!!"
5,Character Driven Masterpiece,"If you've seen the movie, you've GOT to get the book. The movie, at three hours plus, stilly only tells half the story.This book is extremely character driven- and somehow Stephen King can bring all these different people to life in such a real, vibrant and interesting way that by the time your end with this book you feel you actually know these people personally. (In some cases that's good, and in some case's that's not so good.)This book has plenty of passages that will make your hair stand on end and give you goose pimples, but it is also the poignant story of a man in the Autumn of his life quietly reflecting. These passages, of this man in the nursing home reminiscing on a life that is nearing an end, are incredibly moving.Especially when he remembers a remarkable man named John Coffee. The story really comes alive when this special man is introduced to us.I loved this wonderful story. I believe it touches every single human emotion!"
5,The Best Book Ever Written,Hey All. This is one of the best books ever written by King. This book in no doubt will make you think twice about the death penalty. It is probably my favorite book
5,An easy and entertaining read,"Great book. The characters are well developed, and the story is captivating (no pun intended). Keep in mind that this was a novel originally published in serial form, so there is some repetiveness that originally would have helped remind you of where the previous installment left off. This novel could have used some editing to blend it together better, but the author tells us in his forward that he left it as is. With that in mind, it is a good book from a great writer."
5,the green mile,"This story is typical King excellence. The movie is to be released on 12/10/99 and is sure to be worth watching. The portrayal of of the death row and the various characters I believe is King's best work since ""THE STAND>"""
5,Great Book,I enjoyed this book very much. The Green Mile was about a man sentenced to death row for killing two girls. At the prison this man was feared by many because of his size. Along with his size he had special powers that allowed him to heal. The descriptions of the characters in this book are very vivid. In the end this book realy makes you look at life from a different point of view that you realy should see.
2,a less than exciting novel,"I found the book to be extremely redundant.It did paint a good mental movie, but rambled on too much for my liking.If you like a good ending in a book I would not suggest reading this Stephen King novel."
2,I'm amazed that I'm the only one who dislikes this book.,"Okay, so it's not the worst I've ever read. It still ranks far below standard Stephen King. Instead of the killer plots he usually has, this book just wanders without a real point (most likely because he was writing it in parts with a two week deadline for each). This book focuses on its characters, which I guess is good for some people, but it's not Stephen King. There's no real climax at all in this book. Just one man's struggle with his conscience. If that sounds good to you, then by all means, buy it. But if it doesn't, don't believe the other reviews. This is not standard Stephen King. Don't say I didn't warn you..."
4,Very Interesting book... makes you think.,It started out slowly... but became a book I couldn't put down till I finished.
5,Wonderful,This book was purchased for my daughter. She couldn't put it down and had it read in just a few days. Now she is reading it again at school. Loves it!
5,PHENOMENAL BOOK!!!,"I've heard about Stephen King writing fantastic books and wanted to see for my self how good this author really is. I chose ""The Green Mile"" because I heard heard the movie was great. I havent seen the movie yet but the book was excellent. It opened my eyes to all the injustices going on in the world. King used many writing techniques includeing forshadowing and flashbacks. The whole story was just set up beautifully. i read this 536 page novel in about 11 days! I wouldnt recommend it if you've seen the movie. The element of suspense is vital to the enjoyment of this book. It will bring tears to your eyes."
4,Heard It was good,"I did not read the book but heard it was very good. Based on the movie, it should be a good read."
5,Intellectual Horror: Man's Inhumanity to Man,"Stephen King's ""The Green Mile"" offers up a horror of a different kind...that of our own making when we abuse the gift of free will and choose darkness instead of light. No supernatural, nameless, unspeakable ""things of the night"" here; just Mr. King's personal treatise on the evils of capital punishment. I like this new, more spiritually mature, thought-provoking Mr. King, and very much look forward to seeing what work pours out of his soul during his long rehabilitation ahead. I have a feeling he will offer up something for the greater common good, just as ""The Green Mile"" did. Be there...I plan to be!"
5,Stephen King at his best,"I cant believe ive waited this long to read this, but it was worth the wait. now to watch the movie, finally!"
5,THIS BOOK WAS VERY INTRESTING.,I GIVE THE GREEN MILE TWO THUMBS UP. MR.KING KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. I'M NOT A BOOK READER BUT THIS BOOK WAS VERY INTRESTING. HE ALWAYS LEAVES YOU IN SUSPENSE. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. SO I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THIS BOOK TO COME OUT IN THE THEATRE. SO I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS BOOK. ARE CLASS HAD TO READ IT FOR SENIOR ENGLISH CLASS. AS LONG AS THE CLASS IS MATURE THIS BOOK IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANY SENIOR CLASS. SO READ THIS
4,"Makes you think in more ways than one, good overall.","This book made me think about the things people could do if they were able to use their entire brain. I think Coffey had an ability to use the other 90% of his brain. I have heard theories in which people feel that if that were possible, people would be capable of limb regeneration, etc. This book is about life on death row during the depression, but I feel King uses that setting because it symbalizes the mind being caged. I'm sure everyone gets a different spin from this book, but it opens your mind to new possibilties. I recommend this to people with open minds."
5,Stephen King shows once again that he is an excellent author,"I was extremely amazed when I found out that Stephen King does not only limit himself to writing horror novels! The Green Mile is an excellent book that gives an explicit detail on what happened on ""the Mile"". Delacroix's death is a great example. I almost felt as if I were in the group of spectators that were watching him fry. King did a magnificent job on creating John Coffey. This big man with a heart of gold. One of God's greatest creations. While watching the movie, I felt like I knew which character was which, based on the descriptions of them in the novel. The Green Mile is definitely one of my favorite books!"
4,The Title is Misleading but the Music is Good,"The three CD set includes once cd of Ella Fitzgerald songs, one cd of Louis Armstrong songs and one cd of Ella and Louis singing together. The title makes it seem like all three cd's have them singing together.The music is fine. Both singers are amazing. You can't beat Armstrong singing What a Wondeful World. Ella's rendition of Cheek to Cheek is great. I am pleased with the cd's but this is not what I expected when I purchased the three cd set.I thought from the title I was getting three cd's of both of them singing together. If you want a great cd with both of them singing together try Ella and Louis Again."
3,Reasonable Introductory Text,"This book covers most of the standard topics in a third year university course in electronic circuits.It is accurate, but rather unimaginative. It does not do enough to describe the context in which circuits arise, nor to describe the design process. It also fails to tell the reader what comes next: that is, where is all this going, what is our next course, and so forth.Its strong point is a lot of problems that, if worked, should provide a good background for the student."
3,Needed an adaptor,The prongs on the end of the cord did not fit into outlets of the hotels where I stayed in Italy; others have not found this to be true. I got an adapter and it worked fine. It was definitely better than the hotel hairdryers!
2,Small,"Maybe I didn't read the details close enough, but this hair dryer is small- smaller than my hand. I have long hair and this will not do the trick. I'll have to buy a hair dryer once I get to Spain because I'm returning this one."
4,Good,"The coffeemaker is a good deal overall. The filter is a cone-shape though, not the standard. The coffeemaker does include five starter filters. Be aware that the coffemaker is very tall, and does not fit under most cabinets. Also, when changing the filter, remove the filter holder with care as dropping it may ruin the pause and serve feature."
5,Love this pot!,This is such a nice coffee pot. I got a super deal here at Amazon (price mistake?). The plastic flip lid on the pot seems a bit flimsy but otherwise no complaints. Makes great coffee and I love the removable reservoir. Makes for easy cleaning.
4,GET IT WHILE YOU CAN!,"Absolute steal at $15. Very easy to clean; nice design. For those looking for a basic cup of coffee, this is it. I've used the maker for a week now and decided to buy 2 more."
3,Great for the price,"The product is much more expensive on overstock.com. It is a great deal for the price and works well for a back up machine. I replaced a Cuisanart grind and brew machine that was a mess to clean. I may go back to it. The pause and serve feature requires you to remove the pot a little slower than I am used to. This is a very hip and pretty machine in a george jetson or michael graves way. However, it does not take a permanent gold filter due to the shape of the filter holder. So you will need to use paper filters. A good machine for less than 20 bucks on clearance."
2,Disappointed,"While I think Sandi Patti is the best female vocalist in the world, this particular CD really disappointed me. When Sandi sings, she's wonderful as always. However, there was so much talking and the one song with Brian just totally took my husband and I by surprise. I had bought this CD for myself and also to copy to a cassette for my Mother for Christmas, but I gave up on that idea once I listened to it. The one thing I learned from this experience is that I will stay away from CDs that say LIVE! I am still a huge fan of Sandi Patti and will continue to buy her CDs, but this one for me,unfortunately, was a big disappointment."
5,Sandi Patty's work excels!,"What a neat CD release from the most fantastic vocalist ever to live!! If you are looking for a great CD recording of all Sandi's best music, you won't find it here. You will, however catch a glimpse of the person that Sandi Patty is! The family moments are touching, the music stirring and Sandi's voice is as always, riveting. Quite a few of the reviews have stated that they expected more. If so, I would advise them make their own compilation. I don't believe that Sandi ""deceived"" her listeners into buying a ""greatest hits"" CD, but offers a glimpse into the ministry that her life has become."
2,A Horrible cover for a Horrible book,"I did not like this book! It has I must admit a great plot. It's about an outcast, Nessa, and a shadower ((bounty hunter)) Chase. Nessa Volunteers to carry a deadly virus that has been killing scores of her people, to a medical base, but her ship breaks down and she gets picked up by Chase. She then tries to let him take her as close to the medical base as possible without arising suspicion. For he is an enemy to her people and if he knew who she was he would take her prisoner. I loved the plot, but couldn't stand the way Nessa was so unsure of herself. Yes everyone is insecure at times, but this was taking it to another level. She never thought of herself as beautiful and couldn't believe till the end of the book how Chase could be attracted to her. She kept asking herself how Chase could want someone like her. I believe that if a person thinks of himself as worthy others will too. So I just hated her long, continuous doubts. Other than that the book was ok."
2,Not good enough,"I can't believe i'm writing a review about a Daz Dillinger C.D and i'm not giving it at least 4 stars. I think Daz is a very underrated and under used Rapper/Producer, but on this album he did'nt get the formula right. This is the same man who has produced some of Snoop Doggs, 2pac's, Dogg Pound's biggest hits but this album has no stand out cuts. Usually a Daz album has at least one big hitter that you listen to over and over but this album is filled with mellow cuts and cuts using samples from other artists. Overall this isn't a great album by his standards but support this man, because he'll be back with some bangin tracks."
1,not DAZ,"man, what happen over a few months?? this is terrible. Daz should have took the time to put forth some effort in this album. this is bad. not a very good LP"
1,If you bought this album.....,Please do the following:Get off of welfareGet a real jobLearn to read and write in EnglishPut down the boozeStop having babies
5,Please Buy,Buy this album please do not waste time hurry up and buy because this will go great in your collection. The cd is solid all the way through and you can listen to about every track but it is up to you. He does not make anything ground breaking but this album is pretty damn good and he is from the westcoast and i am a huge fan of westcoast rappers. Hurry up and buy go to mall and walk into Best Buy or get it from here on Amazon and click order and you will have a great album.
5,great album,Anyways buy this album it is very good and u have to have this in your rap collection this is not a classic but it is worth a listen. I am a fan of the westcoast and this is one of my favorite albums from there and he represents the west. So hurry up and buy the album it is worth the money and also buy his new one Gangsta Crunk the cover looks weird but it is very good. Anyways buy this click add to cart and order it now.
5,BUY THIS NOW,Title says it all. Nuthin wrong with buying this album it is a great buy and u should own this. I like every song on here and the production is awesome and this guy is very underrated and needs your support so buy it now.
4,"""Dogg Pound Gangsta"" LP Review","""Dogg Pound Gangsta LP"" is the closest thing to the classic DPG sound we've heard from Daz in awhile. Perhaps that's because he's returned to producing again. Not to mention, he has slowed his flow down a bit to fit the laid-back style he once incorporated. Tracks like ""That's The Way We Ride"", ""Do You Think About"", and ""Do U Know"" are in all honesty, some of Daz's best work in years. A long-awaited reunion with Nate Dogg on ""Come Close"" is worth the price of admission alone. The only problem with ""Dogg Pound Gangsta"" is Daz's attempts to recreate classics from the past. The 2005 editions of ""Ambitionz Az A Ridah"", ""Bomb Azz Pu**y"", and ""Fu** The Police"" are all average at best especially when compared with their classic counterparts. For its few faults, this album has plenty of positives to offer. Anyone who was even a moderate fan of Daz during his Death Row days will enjoy this nostalgic trip back to when G-Funk ruled the airwaves."
3,good picture book,I would say this book is not for instructional use for customizing your bike - a good picture book for Harley lovers.
2,Great pictures,The book is full of great color pictures. The projects are more for an experienced mechanic with access to more tools than the average Joe. For ideas its' great. Not recommended as a how to manual.
2,A wet nut,"I did not like this product, but perhaps that is because I never had one before or perhaps I needed to mix it in cooking. I like nuts, but this is no a tradional nut. I could not eat more than one."
5,"Giovanna Russo, Italy","These are quotations from Ms. Russo's email to me about my book: ""I enjoyed your book very much. Every page stimulated my curiosity. I was always looking forward to getting to the next page and sorry to interrupt my reading because there were other things I had to take care of. I felt as if I were in the stories together with your characters, with the only difference that I was not one of the actors but an attentive and thirsty spectator of their adventurous lives."""
4,An amusing read,"I found this set of stories to be largely amusing, though I must say, in places, poignantly sad. Though what impressed itself upon me most heavily, is - I read the disclaimer preceding the stories, wherein it states that all the following either happened to someone else, or did not happen at all, - but I have to say, - it all had the flavor of truth to me, and so I took it! I would happily peruse any further output from this author. Bottom line - I enjoyed it all, and look forward to more."
4,Very Helpful Reference,"My mother has found this book to be a very informative and helpful reference. When she started losing some of her plants to rot, the book explained what it was and how to treat it."
4,Very good,Very comfortable. Only problem is that it gets hot with intense playing for an extended period of time.
1,Too Short for a Tenor Sax,This strap is too short for a tenor sax. I've lengtened it to the maximum and it's still about 2 inches too short. Save your money if you're a tenor player
3,Conerto Alto Sax,"This Sax looks very nice and comes with everything you need to start playing it. I find that it squawks no matter what reed I use, I am going to try a Selma S80 C# mouth piece and see if that helps. If your a beginner you can't beat this for the price."
5,Sax Strap,"This is a very perfect strap, which can uniformly distribute the weight of sax around your neck, shoulders. thanks for a perfect design."
3,Neotech neck strap,"The strap is more comfortable than traditional straps, however the length of the strap is jsut marginally long enough for an alto sax. I'm just under 6 feet and the strap is almost too short for me. The strap material is also somewhat thin and appears flimsy."
5,Black Neotech Sax Strap,Nice plain and simple strap to support the Sax. Nothing fancy but it gets the job done. Can't go wrong for the price.
5,Neo Tech Sax Strap,My grandson is really enjoying the comfort of playing his sax using the Neo Tech sax strap.
5,Perfect product,"I brought this product for my 8th grader, and he likes it very much. It is very comforter. I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommended."
5,Just right,A big improvement for my daughter in 5th grade. She is very happy with this strap because it is so much more comfortable than the strap that came with her alto sax and she likes the swivel hook too.
1,Very Uncomfortable,"I found this to be irritating to my neck because of its width - the edges dug into my neck. Also, the foam rubber on my skin caused me to sweat. I gave it a shot but had to return it."
5,Wonderful,This neck strap is wonderful! It is so comfortable. And the price was fantastic compared to other straps. I would for sure recommend this strap.
4,super fun,"I watched Gingerdead Man 2 and loved every minute of it. The movie set and director were obviously meant to spoof Charles Band and Full Moon, which I thought was hilarious. Plus, its fun to watch the Gingerdead Man curse and say nasty things right before he kills people. It's not exactly the Kings Speech, but it isn't meant to be and that wasn't what I wanted. If you are in the mood for silly, goofy low budget ridiculousness, Gingerdead Man 2 delivers the goods."
3,candy corn,The cookie cutters where a little less sturdy than I thought. You must be careful when cutting out the cookies.
1,Scap,"This rice cooker blew up after exactly 12 months of use.Since it has no ""Off"" switch, you need to unplug it each time after use. If you don't, it remains at ""warming up"" and blow up.Simon"
2,Cute but MESSY...,"Well, this rice cooker is good for those that want another decoration item around the kitchen counter. I think it looks cute, but when you cook rice it goes all over the place. VERY, VERY MESSY. I actually wanted to send it back, but I got lazy just thinking about having to stand at the Post Office long lines, so I kept it. Anyway, I am trying to stay away from rice since it has too much carbohydrates and calories and makes you fat. So I decided just to steam vegetable in it. Kind of a useless tool since I am avoiding to cook the variety foods just because it gets messy. NOT GOOD."
5,Warm Chill TJ Rehmi,"We love this music, and have purchased one as a gift...we hope more of TJ Rehmi's music will become available through amazon.com ! Thank you !"
5,Classic Chill,"If you are like me and have wondered where the creativity and intricate beauty of modern jazz has gone, worry no more. TJ Rehmi has taken it and replanted it solidly in the soil of electronic chillout.The Warm Chill is the perfect chill album because it is intelligent and well crafted enough to demand your attention, and smooth and sensual enough to let it just groove in the background.Enjoy."
5,Mr. Heater Parts,"I was making a attachment to refill 1# propane tanks as seen on line, I found all the parts that I need right here on line, never had to go to Town and try to chase them down, I live in a Rual area and it is quite a trip to a large enough town that might have these parts,Now I can refil my samll 1# Tanks for less than 1/2 of what they cost at the Big Store"
5,Splendid Revisionist Literary Criticism,"Lynn's gripping, well-written biography demonstates that Hemingway's real subject was *not* the advocacy of a code of aggressive macho behavior, but the price of maintaining that code. ""Papa"" paid that price himself by descending into madness, complicated by alcoholism and probably inherited chronic depression. Hemingway could only hint at his demons in his fiction; his famous elliptical style was the result of not being able to admit so many terrible facts to himself. Lynn also nails Hemingway's radical chic stupidities about the Spanish Civil War and his belated disillusionment with communism. He was a great writer--but his greatness sprang from lies, psychic confusion and pain. Lynn demonstates great compassion in the telling of the more awful parts of this tale. Hemingway buffs may not like this book, but they should read it--it's pretty convincing to me."
4,Lynn on Hemingway.,"This is a very coherent, thought-provoking study of Hemingway, especially of his formative years. The recurring theme is that Hemingway's worldview was shaped by mother's penchant for dressing him and his sister in matching clothes. Individual gender roles were ambiguous and not as important as the conflict between a person and his internal animal nature. Hemingway is seen as over-asserting his own masculinity by drinking heavily, treating women as subservient to his own needs, performing dangerous sports, but instead this may be his own lifelong study of this battle between societal roles and nature. Like others who studied this conflict before him, such as Mark Twain, James Joyce, and Joseph Conrad, Hemingway became jaded in his old age, believing that society was not serving mankind equally.As expected, there is a lot of information about writing processes, and his relationship with writers like Joyce, Gertrude Stein, and others, and the influence of Henry James and others."
2,Hemingway:Life and Work,Book is really beat up and worn out with a lot more marks and damage then described. Very dissappointing even at the low price.
1,Lynn Hates His Subject,"As some others have said here, Lynn clearly hates Hemingway. You can read the entire book, as I did, and discover not one redeemable thing about Hemingway, amazing since he is still considered one of the most important writers of the 20th century, one who formed many lasting friendships over the years while he was changing the course of American literature.Lynn is one of those critics who, as one writer put it, is like the partisans who come down out of the mountains after the battle and shoot the wounded. Lynn's analysis of the effect that Hemingway's mother had on her son by dressing him in girls' clothes in his youth is laughable, nickel psychology that would embarrass Lucy in Peanuts.I heard Hemingway's son Patrick at the Oak Park centennial celebration of Hemingway's birth describe Lynn as, simply, ""a liar."" I'm inclinded to agree.Read Michael Reynolds' bio instead."
2,Les Miserables,It probably would be great book for someone following this story but I am not one of it's fans. however I wouldn't say it was bad either. Just not my kind of book.
2,Les Miserables in Kindle,"I could not get into this book on Kindle. Of course,I didn't see the movie but it was a hard book to holdmy attention and I didn't understand it so never finished it."
5,Great Story,Gotta love this classics. Can never go wrong with getting a book. An Excellent story and plus it was free!
3,Book Bub Purchase,"This was a book I purchased for free off Book Bub. It's only ok because I haven't read it yet, but I have so many it will be years before I could do this review if I wait."
2,Too heavy - Ienjoyed the recent Hugh Jackman film MUCH more !!,Too heavy - Ienjoyed the recent Hugh Jackman film MUCH more !! In the written form I found the story line too hard to get into - sorry Victor Hugo -made a great film though !
3,Book not finished.,"I have read 42 per cent of this book. it is too decriptive. I have not read 101 Best Jokes , Hanchart Land or Pride andPrejudice as yet. I am 81 years old and can not read long at a time."
1,Too difficult to read!,I guess I'm just not into literature where you have to read slowly to understand what is being said. I'll go see the movie!
4,Great masterpiece,"I read this book in Spanish first few years ago, the version in English is awesome too, I find out that its matter translation to give the history the right essence on the details, but so far a love it no matter what."
1,T-FAL -- as in Total FAILURE,"What a piece of junk!I bought two of these to stock a Tiki Bar specifically because the promotional info raved about its power, for smooth-blending and ice-crushing for drinks. They were about $45.00 each, which seemed a fair price if they performed as described. I read the directions, but one of the two blenders NEVER WORKED AT ALL, no matter how the jar was ""seated"" or the blades installed or the number of ""clicks"" heard when putting the blade component together. I took that one back. The other one worked about 6 times, and THEN went dead while blending already-crushed ice and mango juice! So much for the superior power and the special ice-crushing blades! DON'T BUY THIS BLENDER, even if it's dirt cheap. Read the reviews!"
1,"leaks, breaks, and has trouble blending","My parents bought me the T-Fal Avante as a gift since I needed a blender. I used it about 10 times until my frustrations with it leaking (even when I snapped everything together) and it not blending (I'd have to push the top 2/3 of what was being blended down, in between blends) were thankfully released by the glass-top part-cracking after I'd put in a warm mixture to blend. I've since bought an Oesterizer and it works much better."
1,not happy,"I purchased the blender, took it out of the box, washed it and put it away. Five months later I took it out to use it and it won't work. It is defective, I can't find a place that sells replacement parts and I don't have the box or the receipt to take it back. I would appreicate it if someone would tell me where I can buy replacement parts for this blender."
1,Don't buy this product,"I bought this product mainly for it's look. When I used it the first time it leaked and smelled burnt. I have now shipped it back to Amazon and will buy another - based on perfomance, not looks."
1,"Looks Good, Doesn't Work!","I received the blender as a gift last year. For reasons I won't go into, I was unable to try the blender until recently. Guess what? It doesn't work at all!! Nothing happens when I plug it in and turn it on. So, I guess I can't really rate it, because I can't really try it. All the features sound good, though."
5,"ole buddy sal Paradise, appreciates...","This is the last great piece to be published on ""Beat generation"", in 20th Century. Jack Kerouac, ""king of the beats"", has his annual celebration in Lowell,MA, his hometown, first weekend, every October.Memory babe author, Gerry Nicosia to be feted there, among many celebrities."
2,"Ren & Stimpy, missing in action...","I bought this UMD set, after having bought the DVD set for home, what a rip-off! Amazon should be shamed for decceptive selling practices in saying this is a season 1 & 2, it's missing 22 episodes! If family guy is sold as a complete 2 season set, and this is advertized as such, it is simply dishonest to sell this set as the compilation that it is not, FOR SHAME!"
3,Good Old Ren and Stimpy,"This movie offers the first 10 cartoons of Ren and Stimpy, ONLY that. Which is fine, but I would of enjoyed a little more cartoons for my $ so dont be fooled by the imitation season one AND two - which may be true? only if both the seasons were 5 cartoons long."
3,The book is better.,"My teenage daughter just completed this course. It is a good human anatomy course. It is NOT a physiology course. It is excellent in terms of body parts and their functions. The chemistry is nominal; there are no actual chemical equations or reactions to know. Even though the course description states that chemistry is required for the course, it really can be very well understood without it. Besides, no high schooler really has enough organic chemistry to understand physiology. The CD is essential for test materials and solutions, but buy the book. It's easier for the student to work with."
5,Apologia's the Human Body,"Our family has used many of the Apologia Science books and found them to be easy to use, clear, and concise. The illustrations used are clear and understandable. This is a superior product."
4,Product as described,"I was happy with this item,it was the exact product they described,not like my other items"
3,Pretty Good,Two very good sequences 'phot shoot' and 'desperado' make this a good purchase. Maria Checa is the only 'name' on the tape but the unknowns are still very attractive and stimulating.Not one of th greatest playboy titles but still worth buying.
4,Honduras Girl Rules,"this video is good if you love latin women there a much hotter then regular blondes , the best girl of the video is the girl from honduras Iveth Cortez."
5,Stop the Imports,Beware of the 'EA Classics' Version of this game advertised under 'New'. These are not the Official Eidos/Squaresoft Platinum Edition. Also Electronic Arts were never associated with Final Fantasy VII so the 'EA Classics' does NOT mean 'Electronic Arts'. The ones advertised are Bootleg Imports from Asia. Please support the Official USA version of the game and stop sellers from selling the illegal version.
3,Haven't Received it Yet,"For a 4 year plan, this is a very good deal. The only problem is that I still haven't received the paper contract in the mail and it's been almost three months since I ordered it. I have the email copy of the contract and have received emails saying they were mailing me a paper copy, but still haven't received one yet. Hopefully if I need warranty work it will go better than this."
3,Not What It Should Be,Warranty starts the day the order is placed---not when the equipment arrives some two weeks later. Hopefully the service will be better! Do not plan to order any other merchandise from Amazon that is not stocked and sold by them!
3,Protection I haven't had to use,"Th protection is there, but I have not had to use it, so I do not know how useful it is."
1,Where is the proof?,"I do no have a written proof of the terms and condition, for the service plan.Please refund me the money. Thanks, I appreciate it.I never receive something for what I have paid for......I should have listen to other reviews.Amazon please help me."
5,Always check your credit card,"This is a good service plan, but keep in mind that most credit cards have protection plans for free if you save your receipt and credit card statement."
5,You'll love these steak knives,Used these knives at a friend's house and had to buy them. The price is very reasonable and the knives are fantastic. The pattern is fun and the clean design goes well with my other silverware.
4,Almost a great boot,"Love almost everything about this boot - sleek look, good height, good fit (I ordered 1/2 size bigger than usual and it's perfect that way). The only small criticism I have is that it has no traction. Not good on slick sidewalks!"
3,suicide by train,This movie isn't easy to watch and is surprisingly upbeatfor the material. The orphan of a woman who parks her car in front of a trainfinds the train engineer at a time when his wife is dying of cancer.The boy becomes the focus of her existence while she waits to die andhe waits for the hearing about the woman's suicide.The issue of him pulling the emergency brake and probably causing a derailmenttakes the back seat to the family that emerges from these ashes.A moving movie is the result that is well acted.
2,"Good Acting, Decent Plot, SLOOOOW to Watch!!","It took the course of several days to watch this movie it was that slow to watch on dvd. So, I kept putting off watching the movie.... Nice story, good acting and that is about all I can say about this movie!"
2,Railed,"The deal breaker for this film is that at no point was the plot plausible. Even that I can suspend if the characterization and emotion evoked by flawless chemistry is in place. Neither was. The story should have been compelling and made me care. Instead I found myself doubting the conflict, thus, not caring about its resolution. I do have high hopes of Eastwood's future films, however."
4,Good Acting And Original Story Line,"I really liked this movie. I had never heard of it. I thought the acting was well done. Yes, the movie is sad, but it works. The story comes together nicely. Defnitely is worth watching."
1,OLD and MISSING CONTENT,"There is no internet/website access as was promised. Extremely displeased, and there is no one to contact about this. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!"
4,"Good value, but patchy print quality","Print a little patchy in places - some text/characters not printed correctly, so not the best quality. That said, its easily readable and a great price, so a good trade off."
4,Informative and dry,"I bought and read this book before going to law school. I think I had seen it on the Harvard law recommended reading list, or something like that, and decided to give it a try. Apparently the book is mostly intended for legal practitioners from other countries who want an introduction to American law. However, as an American with basically no knowledge of any law, American or otherwise, I still found this to be a solid introduction to the legal system of the United States. It is a very dry book, but I still managed to read it from cover to cover, and I learned a ton along the way. Each section also provides great recommendations for what else to read on that topic. This is a very informative and straightforward introduction. For pre-law American students looking for a more friendly introduction, I would recommend first reading ""Whose Monet? an introduction to the american legal system."""
2,Very Slow Service!!!!,ordered this product and a week later it still showing product is prepairing for shipment i mean come on how long does it take to prepair to ship something and especialy something small like this if amazon wouldnt have locked in my purchase than i would have already cancelled this shipment.
3,Kolpin Invisi Doe FANTASTIC! Invisi buck OK,"I own a deer haven including many deer feeders, food plots and hardwoods where I have had the opportunity for years to play with calls while watching large groups of bucks and does. About three years ago I purchased several electronic calls including Cass Creek and Kolpin. The Cass Creek had a short in it right from the start and when it did work I had no visable results. The Kolpin Invisi Buck was somewhat productive when using the doe call on it. Kolpin at that time made an Invisi Doe call which had three doe sounds. This call is deadly however it was discontinued. It is rare that I cannot call a buck with this call. They will come right up to it and smell it. When they walk off I can repeat the sequence and they quickly return. I have called bucks by the dozens with the now discontinued call. Kolpin what were you thinking you got rid of the wrong call!"
5,looooooove it,"I have several Rada knives and loooove them all. My mother is very hard to please with knives and she used this bread knife the night and couldn't stop talking about it! I have a baby new to finger foods so I'm constantly cutting fruits and vegetables. They cut amazingly well, they do great in the dishwasher and they are very inexpensive."
5,I would give it even more stars if I could,"I recommend this knife to everyone. It is beautiful, well made, and sharp. I love Rada brand. Added bonus, it is made in the USA."
4,Good bread knife,"This knife cuts bread (even hard crust) very well, but the small handle is a bit too insubstantial even for my small female hands."
4,Nice Knife,"This is a very nice knife. Handle seems a little small, but most bread knives do. I would buy this again or suggest to a friend."
2,Hate it!,"I see I'm in the minority here, but I'm really not happy with this knife at all. The blade is okay, but the handle is much too short and thin for me to hold comfortably and control the knife while slicing. It needs to be much beefier. I also had this complaint with another Rada knife, so maybe that's they way they make all of their product line. Not to say it's not a great knife, just not for me."
4,Falls short of greatness.,"The coordination of the art and the text, ""designing the layout so that all art appeared on or facing the page on which it was discussed,"" is superb! However, the basic structural organization of the book is confusing. It's hard to imagine that this book is so often recommended for beginning art students, since it seems to give a somewhat disjointed overview of the subject material, lacking in continuity. The focus is extremely conceptual rather than factual. For those already familiar with the basic principles, though, the examples provided and the layout of the text and images will be satisfying."
3,"good sampling, bad literature","As a textbook, it rambles. Could be shortend, or add more substance, like who influenced who, who created what, what legacy does this piece leave and most of all:WHO MADE THIS ARTIST FAMOUS?WHO FOUND OUT THIS ARTIST FOR THE FIRST TIME?Over all a rambling book. Can anyone kindly introduce me a better book?"
5,Great work!!!,These guys create high quality traditional quartet music. I hear several lead singers through out this album but they're all very good! Let God speak to you through them. This is a live recording and the VHS is also available. Hallelujah!
3,Good item but...,"Love the jumbo display, I just wish that I had thought about looking for an item like this with a backlight, because you can't read it at night. I put it in my car & can't read it at night."
3,Just okay,"It tells time well, but the sticky and velcro don't work to hook it up. We found a place for it to stand alone and are happy with that and the size is perfect for a bathroom."
2,Doesnt stick,"The velcro sticks to the mirror, the clock doesnt stick to the sticky back part of the velco. Keeps falling off. Keeps time otherwise."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"Amazon should remove this product from their offerings...it is completely useless!! There's a plastic ""plug"" in the back that is supposed to hold the battery in. It won't close at all....I ended up taping it shut but the tape won't hold - so the clock doesn't run. I had to throw it away. Not even worth paying the postage to return it to Amazon. This clock is garbage - don't buy it!!"
1,Louie,"Waste of money. After inserting battery a time is displayed, but not the correct time. The directions are to press MODE button to set. Nothing happened when MODE button was pressed. No way to change time or set at all. Too inexpensive to return so this is just a loss."
4,Custom metal fab,"Custom fabrication is an art and a science. Do not expect this book to take you from metal work hack to fabricator extraordinaire, but it does go through the basics of fab work. It lacks the process methodology and finer points in how to use the tools and equipment to achieve results, but nonetheless it has very good photo's and will give you a good idea as to the direction you should take and or how to achieve the types of metal work fabrication ideas into reality."
3,Not bad.,"Tim Remus writes a lot of good books. this one is less technical than I prefer, but I'm a tad beyond the basics. It's a good intro book."
3,"One good, one bad",We ordered two of these adapters as we needed one for us and one for the neighbor. Only one unit actually worked.
1,"Junk, do not buy","Worked once, doesn't work anymore. Think there is probably shodding wiring inside, probably with the grounding wire. Don't know enough to fix it. Save yourself the trouble and spend a little more to get a better charger."
3,Questionable quality.,"Upon first inserting this into my dead GBA SP, the ""charging"" light flickered rapidly, and my GBA wouldn't turn on. I had to finesse the plug into the socket until it somehow was plugged in properly before it would start charging. The plug is also a very tight fit. It's cheap, so you get what you pay for, I suppose. Though it does work with a bit of finesse, I should have bought one of the more expensive chargers."
5,Eforcity Charger For Nintendo DS Gameboy Advance GBA SP-,"I just used this charger after recieving it today, it arrived by mail(usps). It's a gray color (don't care about the color tho) and unfolds to plug in at the top, and isn't much bigger than the original charger that came with my GBA SP.. (i lost the original, the whole reason for needing a new one.) My gba charged great, AND i can play it while it charges.. which i couldn't do with the original charger that came with my GBA SP!(I wonder if my original charger was defective?)"
2,Functional but shoddy,"It charged my DS just fine, but after the first use I made the unfortunate mistake of pulling it out of the DS by the cord. Apparently the plug that goes into the DS is not solidly fastened to the cord, so the cord neatly separated from the plug, rendering the device useless.Lesson: only buy third-party accessories from name-brand manufacturers, or just be very very careful."
1,Waste of 5 dollars,"I just got this in the mail today. I stuck it in the wall socket to start charging my Gameboy Advance SP and it lit up for about 3 seconds and then stopped working. Waste of time and money. Sad, I was really looking forward to playing my gameboy, now I have to buy another one."
2,AC Adapter for Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance SP,"The cord is a little short, but it works great; although i don't like to sit next to the wall and play."
1,unhappy,"This charger was not the right one for a nitendo DS, it was too big and my daughter was upset she couldn't use it right away!"
1,DOA!,Charger weighs about 2 ounces which is mostly plastic with a tiny little cable. Arrived DOA! Quality is worse that a paper airplane! Do not buy this junk!
5,It's a plug.,"It's a plug.I couldn't find mine, and I've been wanting to play some pokemon Red on my SP. I looked everywhere for it and finally just bought this one. It's cheap, arrived promptly, and works great. Unfortunately i found mine a few days after its arrival, but whatever now I have two.Nothing to complain about. Quality charger."
2,Didn't fit,The charger did not fit with my Nintendo DS as it stated on the description so I had to return it.
1,DO NOT BUY,This is a shoddy knock off charger. Stopped working after 1-3 uses. Needs to be forced into the charging slot on GBA SP and gets stuck. Cord ripped out trying to take it out. DO NOT BUY.
1,didn't receive the correct charger,"Although the charger was a very good price, it did not fit the DS. The description showed it would work on the Nintendo DS. It cost too much in postage to return, so just kept it but have no use for it."
1,"Cheap, but cheap...","This looked like a regular charger with molded plugs, but when the plug on the game side got stuck in his GameBoy, my son pulled hard, and the whole plug just slipped right off the wire. It's not actually molded, and it's not attached well (I used to do a lot of electronics work; I worked my way through school as an industrial mechanic/electrician). It's a cool design, but this little thing is poop. It died on the second use.The better and more useful one that I found is the charger listed as 'Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance SP Rapid Home Travel Charger with IC Chip'. The design on the one we received was far superior. The blades on the transformer (the part that goes in the wall power outlet) swivel, so it doesn't block another AC jack. It was much higher quality, and we've had no problems with it. It's only about a dollar more."
3,Misrepresented Item,This item is not as advertised. The Amazon listing and item packaging itself states it is compatible with the Nintendo DS and the Gameboy SP. Inspection of the AC unit itself indicates it is *not* compatible with a DS Lite. The unit is for classic only. I have uploaded a picture for your own enjoyment.Sending this back costs as much as the unit itself but we're returning it out of spite. Caveat emptor.
5,"Nintendo gameboy advance SP adaptor, NOT DS!!","This is a charger for a Nintendo Gameboy advance sp, not a DS. But if you shop knowing what your plug ends look like, then you will get the right product. We are very happy with this. Great deal for the price!! Our kids lost their adaptor and all gameboys were dead. We were so happy to find this replacement adaptor and at such a great deal!"
1,Not what it says it is.,This item is NOT a Nintendo DS charger. The connector is much too large to plug in to a Nintendo DS.
1,To big for the ds,"The charger came very quickly. However, the charger is much to big for the ds lite. It is not a trapezoid shape."
3,Functional,"This device is certainly functional. However, it emits a very high-pitched electronic whine as it charges. When it's fully charged, the whine pulsates. Pretty sure this isn't intended, and it's very annoying."
2,Does not last long,I bought this charger for a Christmas present. The charger failed to charge about a week ago. This is too cheaply made. Don't waste your money.
1,Did not fit my Nintendo DS!,"This AC Adapter did not fit my Nintendo DS, even though the description said that it would. Fortuntately, I didn't pay much for it. Not planning on returning it because of shipping costs. Dissapointed & waste of money! :-("
1,Not exactly reliable...,This charger stopped working less than 2 weeks out of the package. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Not for DS,"There seem to be mixed reviews here as far as whether this works on a DS. The one we received was way to big for our DS's (we have 3, one for each kid). To be clear, we have the DS, not the DSi or DSlite, but the DS which this says it fits. It is my understanding the chargers are even smaller for the lite/i, so it probably does not fit them either. It is a bummer because I can't seem to find a DS charger anywhere (everything is for the newer stuff). In general Amazon is good, but this seems to be a rare miss for them."
3,It works,"The charger i got looks different than the picture. There's a bright red LED on the transformer and the prongs don't fold in.That said, the product works great and the price was good. Had the picture been of what I got in the box, I would've bought it anyways."
5,Needed one,"I needed one of these, so I am glad that I found one for cheap. It came in the original package and works great."
3,Not for Nintendo DS Lite,"As others said, this is not for the Nintendo DS Lite. I can use it for Game Boy Advance - so for the $.01 I paid (plus S&H) - it's a bargain, and I couldn't ask for faster delivery."
2,Not very well constructed,"Well, it works but I dont foresee lasting longer than a couple of months...The cord is very flimsy and when I received it, was starting to detach from the wall unit already."
1,U-N-B-E-L-I-E-V-A-B-L-E !!!! Welcome to hell....,One thing that drives people crazy is when others do not do their job! This is one of those cases where no attention to details or thought in their job comes into play. Very very disappointing.The wrong part has been shipped twice!
5,good news,My two youngest sisters have lost there cords and come may i will buy them for themthese are great because they save you money on batteries
1,Waiting!!!!!!!,I ordered and paid for this 5 days ago and they still have not shipped it yet. I don't understand what the issue is!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Ds Gameboy Advance SP AC Charger,1 star bad 5 stars goodcharger works fine *****shipping *I payed for 3 day shipping and It took 2 weeks for this item to arrive.
3,"Doesn't leak, but you can't get it clean","I bought this OXO Good Grips mug to replace my first one. The button was sticking (probably from overuse). I carry the mug on the train in my bag and I never have to worry about leaking. My coffee stays hot even when I don't preheat the mug. I've found the best way to keep the top clean, since it can't go in the dishwasher, is to fill the mug with Instant Hot water and with the button depressed, shake vigorously. Any half and half residue is removed this way. I do this every day and it keeps my mug clean. I love my OXO mug!!I finally had to get rid of this mug. It was really impossible to get all of the gunk out of the lid."
3,"travels well, doesn't stay hot as long as it claims to","definitley made well and spill proof, but no way it stays hot up to 7 hours. Seems to be more like 2 hours. I was really looking for something I could use at home during the day that would stay hot for a longer period of time."
5,The best travel ever!!!!!,"This is, by far, the best travel mug ever made. It keeps things hot longer, it doesn't leak, and the drinking spout is far more enjoyable to drink from than most travel mugs because your mouth isn't touching metal. The ""grip"" is excellent, as well. One HUGE challenge. This is the second one I've owned because my husband tried to help me out one day and put the cover in the dishwasher. It SPECIFICALLY states not to do this. Well they were right!"
1,"Kept coffee warm, but could not reliably and easily clean the top.","The cup did keep my coffee warm, but like others, I had problems being able to completely clean the lid. The company recommended rinsing it out immediately after finishing your drink and ""forcing"" water through the lid by keeping clicking it open and running water through it from the faucet. If there was an issue you could soak it in soap/water. But it is not recommended to put it in the dishwasher.Even following their directions I never felt it was clean enough and always carried a coffee smell in the lid, even after washed (I don't add any sugar or cream). I returned it and got theContigo AutoSeal Westloop Mug.The top of their travel cup is designed to go in the dishwasher and it actually keeps the coffee hotter for longer (and it's 2oz bigger!). I haven't had any issue getting the Contingo clean and even bought one for my wife.["
2,Fatal flaw,"I will confirm what many others have said here; if there's a way to clean the lid, I don't know about it. Nothing I have tried works. I bought this as a gift for hubby over a year ago and it worked great until the build-up of scum inside the lid made it unbearable to drink from after a few months. I tried soaking it in boiling water with dish soap and other things suggested in the reviews here, I even stuck it in the dishwasher several times, against the directions it came with because I was so frustrated with it. To no avail. If you have found a way to clean the lid and have been able to use this mug for more than a few months, I am happy for you, but it has not worked out for us."
4,"Decent mug, simple fix for design flaw","Like other people said, water can get inside the pper lid and make the whole thing smell pretty awful. However, you can use a small drill and make two holes on the outside of the lid -- just into the interior cavity, don't drill all the way through -- you can then soak the lid in a bleach solution. Since I've done that the sour smell has not come back."
3,"keeps coffee hot, but difficult to clean","I've owned one of these for about 8 years. It's finally beaten to the point of needing to be replaced. Excellent durability and insulating qualities. It's been dropped, fallen off the roof of a moving car, and our 90lb labrador retriever chewed on the rubber grip and plastic lid. Overall it performed admirably.My only complaint is that the lid assembly is so complicated that it's virtually impossible to clean properly -- and do not put it in the dishwasher: it will never quite seal properly again. Even brand new there's a little dribble problem with the lid when you drink. I often ended up with a drop of coffe on my nose after drinking.Overall good mug, but I'm looking for something with a handle and a simpler lid."
5,Great spillproof mug,"This mug (if one understands how it works and follows the instructions) is great for preventing spills. I'm prone to spills. I don't always get things set correctly on surfaces and my hand often grazes the tops of things, knocking them over. I've already been spared cleanup at least five times in the month I've had it. The only improvement I can think of would be a way to disassemble the lid for a more thorough cleaning, since you're not supposed to put the lid in the dishwasher."
5,best travel cup ever,"I got this for my husband who carries his latte in the car each morning. He tried many travel cups and they all leaked -some dramatically. He drives a company car and has clients in his car often so he makes a big effort to keep it clean. It was becoming a big chore to keep His latte in the cup.I read some reviews on this cup and ordered it right away. No more spills, coffee is hot until it is gone. great to find a product that does what it claims...Hmmm maybe I need one too!"
1,Unhygienic lid design!!,"I loved this cup when I first purchased it. I'd scoured the internet and stores for a no-spill thermal cup, and thought I'd finally found the perfect one. However, after a few months of use, I noticed I could hear liquid trapped in the lid. If I shook the lid violently, I could get out some drops of the trapped liquid, but never all of it. I also noticed that the the lid would smell awful at the end of a day's use and really demanded washing immediately after use (which in my mind, defeats the purpose of the ""travel"" mug).Eventually I had to throw away the lid as the thought of the trapped old coffee/dishwashing liquid/bacteria buildup seepage was not only disgusting, but potentially harmful...My only regret is that I hastily threw away the lid in disgust and didn't mail it back to OXO as proof that a redesign is in order!!"
1,Impossible to clean,"I have been on a search for the perfect travel mug, and was so excited when I found this because it was the first mug that I have used that really does not leak and it keeps drinks reasonably hot.However, it is not possible to clean the top. My lid has a gross funky smell, even though I always wash it after every use and have tried soaking it in detergents. The fact that it can't be cleaned makes it unhygenic, and also makes drinks taste nasty if you drink more than one thing from the mug.Only buy this mug if you will drink only one beverage from it that has no milk in it AND you will always be able to clean it soon after use AND no dripping is the only thing you want from a mug AND you don't mind a little extra gunk."
3,"Great mug, bad cleaning design","I bought 2 of these mugs last Christmas and have been very happy with the no spill design; however, as mentioned before, the lids are incredibly hard to clean.After 6 months of use, I noticed my coffee starting to taste really sour. A few whiffs of the lid, even though I washed it in soapy water with the lid clicked open after every use, revealed the source of my disgust. I soaked the lid in very hot bleach water and was unnerved by the congealed gunk coming out. Even after blasting the lid with a water spout, bits of congealed ""stuff"" kept coming out. Even though it's not recommened for dish washer use, I'm going to try it. My next step is boiling water and a sand blaster (joke).Love the no spill system, but there should be a way for the user to diassemble the lid and clean it thoroughly. Not sure if I would purchase again as I rather take a chance at spilling my coffee versus not knowing what kind of bacteria I'm swallowing with every cup."
2,nasty film with regular use,"After using this mug for several months, I began noticing that my coffee wasn't flowing through the sip-hole easily and I wondered what was wrong. I tried to clean the lid and, as noted by the previous poster, found that only a Q-Tip could help me get to the gunk that was trapped in the lid.And, this is not just a little gunk. I cleaned for at least half an hour and was still getting nasty congeled crud out of the lid. Even so, I don't believe it is fully clean. I really hope that OXO re-designs this mug to make it easy to clean because I am usually a big fan of their products. But now, I'm too grossed out. I need to buy a different mug."
1,Looks good but indeed awful,"I bought this one because I need one that I can put in my bag without spilling any liquid out. It is no-spill but after a few weeks of use, I foud there is liquid trapped in the lid. The worse is I could not get the liquid trapped in the lid out. Also the lid smells, plus the dirty liquid just sits inside forever. Do you want to have a daily drink from mixing forever liquid inside the lid? I don't. I threw it away immediately."
3,Not quite,"I use this mug to keep my tea hot while I'm at the office. It's a great product that keeps hot drinks heated for several hours. It also has a beautiful stainless steel exterior and interior which is of great quality and design. I'm disappointed because after 5 months of use, the click seal now doesn't work with just one push. I have to push it several times applying extra force to open and close the seal, sometimes pounding the bottom of the mug on a flat surface to adjust it in place. If I do not, the seal gets stuck somewhere in between and no liquid is able to pour out. To get around this issue, I now just leave the seal open which ends up cooling my drinks. Another disappointment was the top being difficult to clean. There are too many grooves for the liquids to get stuck in."
1,Yum... bacteria!,"If you like bacteria in your coffee, you'll love this mug. We had one, and after a few months, we noticed that it had a lot of scum inside that was impossible to clean out. Really, really gross.This is really unfortunate, because the mug had a sturdy design and didn't leak."
2,"Great Mug, But It Can't Be Cleaned!","The idea for this mug is good, but like so many others have said it just can't be cleaned. It keeps beverages hot, the seal works great and is convenient, and the mug looks great. But the fatal flaw is that the top can't be cleaned.I purchased this mug thinking that all of the people saying the mug couldn't be cleaned were just doing it wrong, but that's just not the case. It is practically impossible to clean the top of this mug well. I cleaned with boiling water and soap for a good 10 minutes and I could still smell coffee odors coming from the inside of the top. Those odors would later impart flavor into the drinks I was consuming from the mug; so I just ended up not using the mug anymore.If OXO could design a mug where the inside of the top could be cleaned this product would be a definite 5 stars.Maybe a separate threaded cap on the bottom of the top to expose the inner area?"
1,"Beware ""The Stench""","I loved this mug for a while. It was leakproof, which was basically all I asked of it. I dutifully scrubbed it by hand after each use, making sure to rinse the lid thoroughly. Despite my efforts, I began noticing what I can only describe as The Stench -- a heave-inducing mix of old coffee, old milk, old whatever else I put in there. No amount of cleaning removed The Stench. I tried rinsing with vinegar, soaking in soapy water, etc. Every now and then I would take the mug out of the cupboard, hoping The Stench had dissipated, but it was still there.Then I read other reviews on Amazon about finding filthy globs of mildewy muck inside the lid, and in one case...maggots! MAGGOTS! IN YOUR COMMUTER MUG! That was the last straw. Sayonara, maggot factory."
1,"It leaks, therefore worthless","I like the push-button opening on top and I like how it keeps hot liquids hot for a good period of time. However, this mug is completely useless to me because when I take a drink from it, it leaks out of the side, even when I have the top tightened so tight that my girlfriend can't open it.This is a five-dollar mug being sold for $20. Don't waste your money on it."
2,it liquisucks!,"i'll give this mug 2 stars because it truly is leak-proof. i shook it, flipped it around, threw it up in the air, and nothing came out. awesome, or so i thought. this mug barely keeps coffee warm for 30 minutes. on oxo's website they say it'll keep liquids hot for up to 7 hours. i suppose 30 minutes constitutes the ""up to"" part. i thought i was getting the ideal mug that i could just toss in my bag and go. too bad by the time i get to where i'm going, my coffee is cold."
4,"Good idea, hard to clean, great customer service","Mug is fantastic. You will get buildup in the lid eventually, but if you call in (number on bottom of mug) and explain the buildup, they'll send you a new one free of charge!"
2,"Can't clean it, but it doesn't leak","I loved this mug when I got it initially because it would never leak even if turned on its side. It doesn't hold quite as many ounces as I would have liked, but that isn't the issue. It's impossible to clean. You can't take the top apart and no amount of soaking will get rid of the gross residue inside. If you're planning to use cream in your coffee it would be even more disgusting. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,Keeping liquid warm,I have now used this mug for a good month.I'm pleased with the shape and the easy closing/opening mechanism and I don not find any problem in cleaning the mug.I'm not impressed with its ability to keep a hot drink warm. After four hours it is just lunk warm. Before I ordered this product I had read that it could keep a hot drink warm for 24 hours. It is far from that. Four hours is not that much better then a good cup.Did I order something else then I thought? A travel mug similar in size but with an extended ability to keep things warm?
2,no heat retention and lid complexity,"Hi,I'm afraid to put milk or coffee after reading the reviews and realizing the complexity of the lid to clean. I tried this mug for coffee on its first use, thats all. Thorughly cleaned and using it for only hot water since then. First thing is that water doesn't taste good, and even with taking all the precautions (warming before using with hot water), absolutely there is no heat retention.I wonder if this is a travel mug to keep items cold or hot for at least 1 hour. Any comment is welcome."
1,Unsanitary,"When I first purchased this mug, I was very pleased: it didn't leak or drip and an added bonus -- it actually kept the coffee hot, not just warm. However, I realized that it was quite difficult to clean, especially if it sat empty in my car all day. I purchased a baby bottle nipple brush to try to get inside the spout (actually I tried two different nipple brushes) and really wasn't too pleased. I soaked the lid at night and did the best I could. Then one morning as I was traveling at 65 mph along the interstate, I took a sip of coffee. As I was returning the mug to the cup holder next to me, I glanced down and saw little tiny somethings on the top of my mug. Because I was driving, I could only glance and I thought I detected that the little tiny somethings were moving. When I stopped and was able to take a good look I realized that the little tiny somethings were some kind of worms..YUK. The mug was a breeding ground for maggots. DISGUSTING! It went in the garbage!"
2,Impossible to clean,The lid is impossible to clean. I drink tea with milk and muck stays inside lid making fetid smells. Stay away from it.
3,OXO Travel Cup,The cup works well but I am disappointed that it is plastic and not metal as earlier ones I purchased. I don't think it keeps beverages as hot as my husband's metal one.
2,"Doesn't leak, but otherwise disappointing","This mug doesn't leak, which is great. My compliments end there. It really doesn't keep my coffee hot that long - maybe 1/2 hour. But the worst part is that you cannot properly clean it! I spent $20 on this darn mug and I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'm going to have to throw it out after just a few months of use. I've tried soaking the top overnight in hot soapy water but it's no use. My coffee just doesn't taste right in this mug. I'm very diasppointed because Oxo makes some great products, but this is not one of them."
1,Bad lid design,"The cup is fine, keeps contents warm, but the lid is horrible because the gasket that keeps the fluid out when the top is closed does not come off the top--therefore is nearly impossible to clean. As a result it picks up odor (and taste) of previous contents. It is not a good design, after a few uses of a variety of drinks (from hot chocolate to tea to coffee) I could not stand the residual taste and don't use it anymore."
2,Impossible to Clean,"I used this mug for several years - until I realized that the inside of the lid cannot be cleaned. I tried everything - hot water, dishwasher, etc. I even tried probing the interior of the lid with skewers wrapped in a small piece of wet napkin - the result of which was so disgusting I could no longer use the mug. If you use any type of creamer, this mug is not for you. All of that cream gets trapped in the interior of the lid and it does not come out - it congeals into pure nastiness...."
2,Water gets trapped in lid,"OK...so the water got trapped in the lid because I left it at a friend's house & she put it in the dishwasher...basically, my own fault because they tell you not to do that.However, I agree with another reviewer, because once this happened I realized that it is basically impossible to clean the lid. From past experience with other travel mugs, I know how much gook can collect in the nooks & crannies if you don't take it apart & clean it regularly. It got me thinking, what is in that lid that I can't see. Ewww.So, now I am not worried about getting the water out of the lid because I could not drink out of this mug anymore without being grossed out completely. Too bad because this had been my absolutely favorite travel mug ever."
3,"No spill, but makes my coffee taste yucky!","As claimed, this product is very good at keeping the liquid sealed in without leakage. It keeps hot liquids moderately warm for a few hours. One problem is that the heat can be felt escaping from the rubber portion, as a previous reviewer noted. But what kills it for me is that it makes my coffee taste like rubber and plastic, even after only a few minutes. That alone makes it practically useless for me."
3,To easy to scald yourself...,"I'm not as enthusiastic as most others about this mug.It does keep coffee warm, and doesn't leak as long as you screw the lid on tightly.However, I have a couple issues with it:1) Since the coffee is sealed in the mug, you don't experience as much of the aroma, and much of what we perceive as ""taste"" is from that aroma.2) More importantly, it's too easy to scald yourself. When hot coffee is in a regular mug, you can sense how hot it is as you tip the mug, and can sip and draw air across it to moderate that heat. With this mug, there's a delay in the coffee reaching your lips as you tip the mug, since it has to work its way through the sealing mechanism. If that coffee is too hot, you can't ""back off"" as easily as you could with a regualr mug. In short, it's hard to tell if the coffee is too hot, and too easy to burn yourself trying."
1,Warning!,Don't buy this mug or any mug like it until you're certain that you can clean the lid.The design of these lids (especially this one) are too clever by half. It's a classic demonstration of engineering without testing.You will be disgusted (or amazed) by what grows in your lid over the course of three or four weeks.Here's the news though: an OXO spokesman told me that this mug's lid is being redesigned so that it's cleanable. She said the mug would be available Christmas (2010). Hold tight until then.
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I lost track how many travel mugs I bought looking for exactly this one ! It is beautiful designed, it has the right size, and the most important thing of all leaks free. Ah of course, as if all that wasn't enough it actually keeps the drinks hot for a quite long time.I read in other reviews about the cleaning issues, but as I am a tea kind of person, that hasn't been a problem for me.The only thing I don't like too much is how loud the button can sound when you press to open, it gets very noisy in a quite work meeting.."
1,Don't Bother,I bought this cup at the same time as I bought two of the Contigo cups.Silver & Graphite Contigo AUTOSEAL'' Stainless Steel Mugs ComboWe tried this cup for a whole month and it just wasn't worth the hassle. The mouth was just enough smaller to be a pain to fill with hot chocolate powder.
4,Works great,"This item is great. It doesn't leak and is simple to use, fits in cup holders, keeps servings to a reasonable amount.It seals a little too well, remember to wash and let it air out."
5,Love it,"I've had my travel mug for at least two years, and it still works perfectly. My coffee stays hot all day, and I've never had a problem with leaks. It cleans well in the dishwasher."
2,Hmmmmm,"I just bought 2 of these: Looks good, doesn't leak but..... it actually doesn't hold that much coffee and it doesn't stay hot for long - you can feel the heat leaving through the sides."
3,stinky o-ring,"I really dig this travel mug - or at least I did, for the first few months of its use. Little spillage and good heat retention for my coffee. However, after having been heavily used - usually two to three cups of strong coffee a day - for three months, the o-ring seal on the bottom began to discolor to a grimy brown and smell really awful. Soon, all my coffee began to smell and taste of plastic. Eventually, I just removed the seal. So, my coffee tastes good again, but I have no spillage protection. Overall a good design, but I wish the seal had been more resilient."
3,Ok Mug,"This travel mug is ok. The reason it is not outstanding is that liquid gets trapped in the cap. Makes it a hard item to completley clean. Other than that, easy to use, keeps things hot or cold for hours. Doesn't break when I drop it. If you don't mind taking extra time to shake the inside of the cap until it is empty while cleaning then get it."
5,Found the best mug for me - the total clutz,"It took a lot of time searching this site and coffee shops to find the mug I have been looking for. After reading all the reviews, I choose this one and LOVE IT! (No, I don't work for the company - I always wonder about that when reading reviews).It truely does not leak. One word of caution - make sure you have the threads matching to the lid when tighting or it will leak some. Just unsrew it and try again."
5,No leaks and no drips,"My favorite travel mug. No leaking, and no DRIPPING! I am one of those people who always has a coffee stain on her shirt. Not with this mug. The way the lip of the mug is shaped and textured, I have never dripped coffee on myself.DETAILS: 6.5 inches tall without lid, 8 inches tall with lid screwed on; you push a button (and release) to open the drinking hole, which stays open until you re-push (and release) the button.Hand wash only (but I put it in the dishwasher top rack anyway and it's fine so far). Do not microwave (or it will crack). Holds about 16 oz of liquid and keeps it hot (longer if you keep the drinking hole closed); doesn't drip if knocked over, unless drinking hole is open. Very durable; I've used it almost everyday for a year with no noticeable wear of any kind.It's also great for using around the house so that my toddler doesn't get burned by my forgetting to watch my coffee."
2,Smell of plastic from the lid,"Although the insulation and the spill-free features of this product is great, the plastic taste possibly from its lid makes bad taste. Now, I am using the bottom part only without the lid."
2,Wish I knew...,"I bought this at a local hardware store over a year ago, after having the plastic version I bought at Target for at least 2 years prior. I'd never considered checking Amazon for reviews on it, but I'm really glad I did because I threw out my first one, noticing the smell was a bit off in the lid. I thought it was just getting old and I wasn't washing it enough. Today while washing my stainless steel mug, I poked around in the bottom seal area with a wooden coffee stirrer and found (like many other people) lots of black-brown gunk. Wonder if this is why I've been sneezing more at work.... I used to rave about this mug to all my coworkers too! I'm going to try the Thermos brand, I hear it's much easier to clean."
2,Agree with other viewers on the +/- design of mug,"This mug is spill proof 110%. I was so impressed with the design of the lid (spill proof and push button easy open/close) that even though I thought . . . hmmmm . . . how can I clean this lid effectively so there is no build up, I soon discovered you cannot. I read a post on November 3 that OXO has redesigned the lid so you are able to take it apart to clean effectively. I hope this is true because I love my OXO mug but not at the expense of 'taking in' all the gunkies that build up in the lid. BTW, I too noticed recently that the coffee was coming out slower and slower and when I read post where another user experienced the same thing and she gave details of why this was happening, I thought ohhhhh . . . then felt sick!"
2,"Unsanitary, therefore unusable","The liquid flow kept getting slower and slower. Finally, I took the top apart. Geck! Mucho disgusting-looking crud. I put it back together but can't bear to use it. Gift from wife, so can't throw it out, but I will now use the older Thermos mugs she got me earlier. Not as good at keep coffee hot, and not as absolute on the no-spill front, but way better on the health front."
2,Would be 5 stars if I could clean the lid,"This cup would probably work really well if you use it for clear beverages. It is NOT good for coffee if you take milk or creamer as there is no way to clean inside the lid. A rinse just won't work & I wrestle with it & get pinched fingers trying to pry everything up to clean inside. Got a nasty mouthful of caked-on creamer one day. I still use it occasionally because it seals perfectly & I can toss it in my lunchbox without a leak, but the lid does get nasty."
5,Regina,"I purchased one of these mugs from Bed Bath and Beyond a few years back. I wanted to purchase two more for family members, and I found them easily on Amazon.com These are the best travel mugs ever. They never leak and keep your beverages hot or cold for very long periods of time. HIGHLY Recommend!"
2,"Nice design, but leaks.","The drink spout seals well, but the seal for the lid itself leaks. Too bad, I really like OXO products."
4,"The best ""travel cup"" so far, but not perfect...","The best ""travel cup"" so far, but not perfect...virtually spill-proof, but not te easiest to clean. A cleaning ""trick"", rinse the ""inside"" of the cap mechanism out immediately after using it..."
2,Great start but poor finish,I really enjoyed using this mug initially. It did a great job of keeping my coffee warm for hours and it never leaked. Unfortunately it was difficult to clean. I found myself taking a gulp of soap subs after cleaning it even though I rinsed it extremely well. I probably could have lived with that but eventually the push button stopped allowing me to close the spout...so much for not leaking after that. It became so bothersome that I ended up getting a different travel mug.
3,You can take apart the lid...,"The lid has a button for opening/closing and under that button is a screw.The button pops off with some effort, the screw comes out easily enough.Then there is a simple spring mechanism (perhaps take a picture so you'll know how to put it back together).Clean the inside with a baby-bottle nipple brush and you'll be good to go.I admit that I drink only black coffee out of this mug, so I don't usually experience all the gunk that others have mentioned.Yes, it is a pain to clean. But so far it is the best travel mug I have found (zero leaks)."
2,Very Unsanitary,"The mug is great in the sense that it is spill proof, but as mentioned, it is impossible to clean out the lid. Nothing works. Nothing is more nauseating than going to take a sip of coffee only to smell rotten dairy from the air hole found on top of the lid.Avoid, and go the extra mile."
4,"Oxo improved lid, but is keeping it secret?!","I had the earlier version of this that worked great but was very hard to clean. I kept waiting for OXO to come out with a new version, but nothing happened. Finally gave up and bought one at Bed Bath and Beyond; it wasn't in a box, just in a cardboard holder. When I got it home I noticed ""Lid comes apart for easy cleaning"" on the cardboard holder. The lid is very similar to the old one, but you can unscrew the internal gasket that moves up and down when you click the button on the top. It may not be a perfect solution to the cleaning problem, but it certainly will help.I went to the OXO website expecting to find something about the new lid, but it only shows the old version, which looks identical from the outside. Very strange. Mine has the same item number as the old one, 1055291. OXO's website has it as item number 1055291V2."
5,amazing at preventing spills,"Other travel mugs are absolutely useless compared to this thing. When closed, you can turn it upside down and NOTHING will leak out. Over months to years, sediment does build up in the top, but I just put it in the dishwasher every few months and had no problems. I had mine for FIVE years before it malfunctioned....the plastic on the bottom came loose from the rest of the cup. I never noticed a plastic taste as other reviewers mentioned. I am about to buy a second one now."
4,OXO Insulated Travel Mug,"I have tried many insulated travel mugs. This one is definately the best I've come across thus far. I give it four stars! Drinks really do stay hot much longer than most mugs found for the same price. I've found the contents still at a nice temperature after four/five hours, but after 6 hours it was cool.The manufactors recommends preheating or pre-chilling the mug for increased insulation. I haven't used this mug for keeping drinks cold so I can only review this product for heat retention. This mug is spill proof to boot. A big plus. There is nothing worse than traveling and having your tea/coffee spill all over you or your car. This won't happen with this wonderful mug! We followed the manufactors directions and put it to the test by holding the mug upside down full of fluid. Not one drop escaped. Give it a try. IF your not happy the manufactor will give you a refund."
1,"Spill Proof Yes, Sanitary..um No.","After using this cup 3 times, it wasn't usable any more which was very disappointing as it worked great up to that point. What went wrong was, this cup didn't always get rinsed with in minutes after being used (it would sometimes sit for a few hours, who has time or a place to hand wash a cup while on the go which is what this cup is for?). And coffee/cream and what not would get trapped up in the mechanism that helped keep the leak proof lid, leak proof.We tried the dishwasher, soaking in hot water and soap and even bleach and the ROTTEN MILK smell that got stuck up in there never came out until it was slightly masked by the bleach. Obviously whatever is in that cup that makes it spill proof makes it impossible for a real deep clean. I had to toss it out.It was really great for a spill proof mug, but not very sanitary if you ask me."
1,You can't clean the lid. Need to know more?,"I had one for years. Drank tea with soy or hemp milk. After washing it, I could see crud on the orange ring under the lid, but I could not reach it. After reading some reviews, I popped off the top button, unscrewed the flange and removed the flange. The top of the flange (that you can't reach any other way) had moist crud on it. There is a cavity from the bottom of the lid to the drinking hole; it might hold a tablespoon of liquid. The sides of the cavity had lots of moist crud. It is angled in such a way that I could not get to all of the sides of the cavity with a cloth or a Qtip or a toothbrush. And I still could not reach the crud on the orange flange. I gave up and recycled it. Yuck! How can this thing be on the market?"
2,Other Design Flaws,"I filled it with boiling water. The middle button operates a open/closing valve with a reassuring click. The other reassuring thing it does is it takes a volume of the boiling water I put into the mug and spits it right back out in my face while it's still hot. Then pouring it out, the lid is designed not to pour forward but to go into a mouth, so if you need to decant hot water into a different cup it will backsplash. I agree that in other ways this thing looks and feels good, and the sealing mechanism is the only one I'd feel ok about putting into a bag with anything else. But be careful while using it."
1,Look Elsewhere!,"I bought and used 3 of these in the space of a year. Great at keeping drinks hot, leak proof, nice size. Eventually the cap would gum up to a point where it was no longer leakproof. Looking around for a replacement here at Amazon I discovered a reviewer who revealed the trick to getting the sealed top unit open, ostensibly to clean it and thusly restore the click button mechanism. Holy Cow! Looked and smelled like something from a Dean Koontz novel in there! I'm surprised that such an unhygenic product can be marketed. Unless you enjoy bleu cheese with your beverage, buy something else!"
3,Not so good to travel with,I have been looking for a real travel mug that I can actually take places with out having to carry a big bulky mug. I mean if the product is called a travel mug shouldn't it be easy to travel with? The Oxo mug is nice but its a bit pricey and again just to big to put in your bag or coat pocket and travel with. If you are really looking for a travel mug you should check out the Collapse a cup. Nice 17oz cup that collapses down to 3 inches and wont leak.
5,Great Travel Mug,"I've had this mug for about 6 months now and I haven't had a single spill with it yet. It seems to be totally leak-proof. It's slightly annoying that you aren't supposed to put it through the dishwasher, but I'll willingly wash it by hand every night if it means that this mug will keep up its great performance."
2,short lived bliss,"I used this mug for about 6 months. During that time it served me quite well. The size was perfect, and it was great at keeping my coffee hot and spill-free. On the downside, the top doesn't disassemble and is extremely difficult to clean unless perhaps you were to soak it in vinegar every week. It is not dishwasher safe. The rubber gasket that makes the valve effective eventually warped, which made opening/closing the valve hit or miss. For a $20 mug I was expecting a long life of carefree operation."
2,Incredibly hard to clean,"I love that this travel mug is airtight, keeps my tea piping hot and my cold drinks super cold for hours. It's also spill proof in the car and easy to drink while driving.However, as another reviewer mentioned, it's incredible hard to clean this mug. I used this mug at first for my coffee every morning and I always use half and half. I would rinse and wash it out every day like I normally do with travel mugs. After a month, I noticed a strange odor coming from the lid. Upon further inspection and cleaning, I too noticed that there was a lot of crud trapped in the lid mechanism. I ended up cleaning it with a combination of steaming hot tap water, q-tips, and dish detergent. It took me about a half an hour to get everything out. But who has the time to do this every day?Now I limit its use to plain tea and cold drinks. This is disappointing to me because this mug is pricey as far as travel mugs go."
3,Great at first glance and use.,"It does keep your drink hot. It does seal very well. However, I had to throw mine away after only a few months. If you are going to use this for coffee(I would imagine most will), the top will get filled with ""gunk"". It is immpossible to clean the top well, if at all(at least I didn't see a way). Also, due to the design of the top, the tumbler is very top heavy, leaving it prone to falling over at the slightest bump. The top which does not hold liquid is approximately 1/3 the height of the cup itself."
2,"Hard to clean, plastic taste","This mug keeps things cold or hot well, and the seal is easy to work with one hand - you push a button, which shows a red border when open, and then push it again to close. It hasn't leaked on me.But - the lid is just impossible to clean thoroughly, for the reasons cited by several other reviewers. I would never put any liquid in it that tended to spoil including coffee or tea with milk or cream or, for that matter, sugar. And when I have mildly flavored tea or plain water in the mug, it has a distinctly unpleasant taste of plastic."
2,Gunk build up,"I was pretty happy with this mug at first - it really is spillproof (though you do have to make sure not to overfill, and then really tighten the lid down). But ultimately I cannot recommend it because the lid has a complicated fluid channel that is pretty much impossible to clean, and it cannot be disassembled. Looking at the gunk that had built up inside the lid, I realized that after a year or so of using it, I was going to be throwing it away. While some users might consider that an acceptable trade-off for a leak-proof mug (or maybe would not be so squeamish), I will go looking for a durable mug that can be more easily cleaned."
4,"Many Pros, few Cons","[...]How well does it keep the drink warm:The label claims it holds `temperature' for up to 7 hours. Hmm...I drank a 12 oz cup of hot tea out of the thing. (so the cup should have been pre-heated already) Then I rinsed it with cold water. I boiled 8 oz of water to 208F and put that in the cup and closed it up for 1 hour. After 1 hour the water temp was 150F. After 2 hours the water temp was 126F. I stopped measuring after that.So, it was still a good warm drinking temp after 2 hours. However I'm not sure what impact opening and closing it to drink from it would have in terms of loss of temperature. Draw your own conclusions about what the temp would be after 7 hours. For me, that's good enough."
2,"After about a year, it doesn't work as well.","I've had this mug for about a year and it doesn't keep things hot or cold for more than a couple of hours anymore. When I first bought it, it was great. It kept my coffee hot for over 3 1/2 hours. But now, when it starts to reach that 2 hours mark, it becomes lukewarm. I really liked this mug because it has a great spill proof top which is also an easy one-hand click-down, drink type lid. It's supposed to have a five year warranty, so I'm still looking for my receipt so I can try to return it..."
3,too small and not dishwasher safe,All's well if you don't drink very much coffee and you're willing to hand wash the mug. How about an 18oz mug that's dishwasher safe??
1,piece of junk,"The designers were probably too preoccupied in making sure it doesn't leak from the top...this thing leaks from the side ALL THE TIME!!! It ruined bags, jackets, books, etc and made for miserable commutes until I replaced it with a better model (Thermos)."
1,threw it away,"This was one of 2 insulated travel mugs that I bought because I had read a review that it was good. I ended up throwing this one away. It was impossible to clean properly and no matter what I did, there was always a horrid, gooey substance leaking out of the lid after it had dried on the counter. I always unscrewed the gasket part, but apparently it was just impossible for hot soapy water to clean out all of the inside parts that weren't removable, even after prolonged soaking. Spare yourself the waste of money and get a good one...like the Thermos Nissan travel tumbler."
1,Bye Bye white shirt....,"This thing does not work at all. Coffee dripped onto my white shirts both times I have used this. It leaked from several places around the bottom edge of the lid everytime I tipped it over for a drink. I originally thought I was doing something wrong, like overfilling the mug. I then filled it only half way and it still leaked. I see that others have had the same problem with it leaking at the threads. What's the use of a travel mug that leaks?"
3,OXO Good Grips LiquiSeal Travel Mug --stainless steel,"Positives:--the best no spill design I've seen--the best one-hand open/close mechanism I've seenNegatives:--insulation is OK/good, but not great--cleaning the cover assembly is a pain, if not impossibleThis is the best travel mug I've found so far."
5,BEST EVER! - New Design easier to clean,"There's no point to look for another product, this mug is the best! No spills at all. Stays HOT for a long time, even with the button open. Sooo easy to hold - you can drink, open & close using only one hand. It fits into cup holders with no problem. I like the stainless steel mug better, not sure why, but the others are perfect as well.If you drink more than what this holds, then get 2 - it's worth it! and it stays hot!UPDATE: My coffee is black and extra sweet - so I can't comment on coffee with milk---it's still great for me!01-22-13 UPDATEStill the BEST EVER!! I recently lost mine and had to buy a new one - and the new one has a detaching disk for better cleaning!!"
2,Gunk-tastic,"I have been using my Stainless Steel LiquiSeal(tm) Travel Mug for about 10 months (it was a gift from a friend). In that period, I have been unpleasantly surprised several times with floods of the grossest gunk I have ever seen. As many people online have described, there is no way to properly clean the lid of this coffee mug, and it has become a haven for congealed coffee (read: old milk) and, what is worse, bacteria. Though it obviously does a fantastic job of being a spill-proof mug, it should not do this at the possible expense of the drinker's health. I have tried soaking, boiling, shaking, and forcing pipe cleaners through the top of this product, and am only occasionally rewarded with seeing the gunk come out of the top before I pour a fresh cup of coffee into it."
5,Excellent,"This is one of the best books I have read recently.Whilst exile and loss are unavoidable themes for writers from ex-Yougoslavia, this is a particularly compelling story largely due to its central character.She holds her breath and then can't any more.Read it!"
2,Tedious to the point of exhaustion...,"I generally like literary works more than I liked this. I just simply can't get on board with anything. The writing style is acceptable, but nothing happens in the first 60 pages to garner a readers interest at all. Perhaps if I were Eastern European, or had lived as a refuge this book might appeal to me more. I just find the characters non-descript, they come in large waves, leaving you unable to separate them. There has to be a story here, but I'm just not interested enough in the characters to continue."
3,ending is laughably far-fetched,"Too bad, because this could have been a five star novel.This writer can write, no doubt about it--and she has things to say,but the ending is so ridiculous and hard to accept (it seems as thoughthe writer was lost when coming to terms as to how to end her tale) thatit practically invalidates all that preceded it.I mean, the wrap up is something like a cheap twist ending in a B-gradenoir/indie flick.And this writer is too good to do something like that. I still can't believethat she decided this was the best way to resolve her tale (even twoweeks after having finished reading her book.)"
3,Fair book,"I have built four of the projects in this book.Dimensions on the strawberry tower were conflicting. Measurements were wrong and some dimensions left out. Some of the projects in this book were not proof read. Lots of good pictures, but could use more detailed instructions."
4,Scalps review,Scalps was a highly ambitious low budget horror flick that should be in everyones horror collection. The story is well written and proves as an interesting spin on the slasher flick. Instead of making the evil killer a crazed lunatic like in most of your horror films from this time frame(the early eighties) it uses a evil native native american spirit as its vehicle for massacre. I think this makes it scarier than most of the traditional slasher films. The movie is filled with gorey and darkly frightning scenes. The only problem I had with the movie was the sometimes inappropriate lighting it used during some of the nightly killing scenes. It seems to be daytime sometimes in the middle of the night??? And also some of the acting is sub par but an the whole is pretty decent. I really like some of the slow motion chase scenes near the middle of the movie and also the hauting indian face that flashes in the fire and through out the film. Chilling!!!.......Jerry
3,Better than nothing,"but to start the quality of the DVD stinks. First of all it is not a studio made DVD. it is burned in DVD -R format. Looks like it was transferred from VHS. Again it is better than nothing because I like the film. Some good gore scenes, decent acting. 3 stars"
3,non-pc B-movie gore,"Briefly, college students digging where they shouldn't. End result, student possessed by spirit of Black Claw, an avenging Native American spirit exacting his revenge via the forgotten art of scalping. A creepy movie with a very familiar theme (...).The film ""stars"" many of the director's standard cast - most of whom were key players/extras in later films (Tomb and Biohazard). Notable names include Forrest J Ackerman (B-movie bit playa) and... well just Ackerman.This is the 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, featuring a new letterboxed transfer, audio commentary by Fred Olen Ray and writer Lee (T.L.) Lankford, the original trailer, and an exclusive still gallery."
2,Not reccomended.,"Sixteen-year-old Esther watched in horror as her father was led away to be burned at the stake. For the year was 1492, the place Spain, the Inquisition was determined to cleanse the country of all non-Christians, and Esther and her father were Jewish. Through a bribe, Esther obtains a place on the Santa Maria, under the alliance of Pedro, a Christian boy. Esther doesn't know where the ship is going and she doesn't care. All she wants is to get as far away from Spain as possible. At every moment, she fears that someone will discover that she is a Jew, a girl, or both. I had high expectations for this book, and was rather disappointed. The plot was paper thin at times, the characters cardboard cutouts, and the romance just made me queasy. It's not the very worst book I've ever read, but it isn't really any good, either."
5,A wonderful read....,"It takes some time to settle the soul, after reading this gem. It seems so real because the author dares to take reality and bend it just enough to deliver a fantastic tale - in true soap opera fashion. To all the Lou's out there...don't settle for a Stonn. Head on down to Nawlin's and find your boogie on Bourbon Street!You're worth it!!"
5,A Christmas gift to me!,"I purchased this book in the fall of 2012. I didn't get to read it until mid-December! What a Christmas gift this has been! Thank you so much Emmy for this hard work.This work is a heartwarming breath of human courage, love and endurance. As I sit in my warm and cozy North American chair, I realized how much I have to be thankful for! It also makes me realized the power a few human beings can have when they dare stand together for what is right. It's not all happy endings, it's fascinating!"
1,Very Disapppointed,This is the worst movie I have ever seen Winona Ryder have a part in. It seems to me that about every one word spoken starts with an F. The writers of this movie must have a street language background. And the movie is just not believable - I wasted my money on it. Don't waste yours. I ended up throwing this movie in my dumpster when I finished watching it.
3,Overlooked Sundance gem from 2008,"""The Last Word"" tells the improbable story of a standoffish suicide-note writer (Wes Bentley) falling in love with the sister (Winona Ryder) of one of his clients. The more she learns about him, the more she likes him--until she discovers what he does for a living. The best performance in the movie comes from Ray Romano (and I've never been a huge fan of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"") as a prospective client who works doing background music for schools.If you can get past the improbability of the basic premise, there is much to enjoy in this movie. Bentley makes his character believable (as much as any one person could), and Ryder gives a lively performance. A good rental with a Sundance pedigree."
2,Remastered?,"I bought the remastered version just to find a major error in the remastering of the title song ""Penthouse and Pavement"". It made me wonder if any one was paying attention to what they were doing in remastering this great album. About one minute into the song ""Penthouse and pavement"" all the highs drop out of one speaker for about five seconds and then return. I own this on vinal and an original pressing of the cd and this error is not in the master tapes. I thought maybe it was just on the downloadable mp3, but found this error on other websites where this album is sold. If it weren't for a couple annoying glitches I would have given this 5 stars."
1,Not enough spirituality.,Not enough spirituality. There is not enough Jesus in this movie for it to be deemed an inspirational movie. Not enough to be convincing.
1,my order has not yet been shipped,"my order has still not been shipped despite the date they say it will be shipped,its been a week and seller refuses to reply to emails, I need this book for a very important project coming up soon and if I dont recieve this book by next week I will be forced to file an A-z claim with this seller. I used to work for amazon and the way they lay off people based of productivity and qualtiy, I can not believe they allow this seller to continiue to sell from their website. I wish I had looked over the reviews before purchasing, this is THE worst SELLER despite pricing."
4,A good buy for sure,"I really like this little stool. It's short but it works great in the basement. It would be perfect if it had a back on it, but the comparable stools with back were way more expensive. This was worth the money for sure."
4,commendable,"I bought this book to read while on an airplane. I wanted to know more about the mechanics of flight to make myself more comfortable with the mystery of flight. The book didn't really satisfy all of my questions, but it left me with something more. Yes it was hard to get into. The first essay was just ok and really brings out Langewiesche's thinly veiled condescension (or maybe misunderstanding) of non-pilots. And the second essay where he introduces where he introduces his admiration for J.B. Jackson was where he almost lost me. But the third essay, The Turn, hooked me. An intricate study of the physics of flight, Langewiesche deftly interlaces history, science and his own experiences to give the reader valuable insight of the experiences in the cockpit, intellectual and emotional. I will recommend this book by the virtue of this one essay, though of the ones that follow there are some that are equally readable and there are some that are not."
4,"Great gift for a pilot, but contains one horrible error","I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and will buy copies for my instrument students. There's a lot of material that explains what goes on in the real world of aviation. But I was amazed to read, on page 67, the implication that a passenger on an airplane that is accidentally rolled inverted would not feel it. It's true that an extremely skilled aerobatic pilot can do this, but the stunt is as far from the ability of most pilots as brain surgery -- perhaps farther because of the brain surgery pilots out there. I simply cannot believe that the passengers of Air India Flight 855 did not know the airplane was in trouble before it hit the water, as Langewiesche implies. Comment, anyone?"
3,"Sans chapters two and six, an excellent read.","As a commercial pilot and and with an education in meteorology (minor), I looked forward to reading this book. The chapter titled ""The Turn"" as well as the next two chapters capture the pilots sense of ""inside the sky"" in a way that I've seldom read. Langewiesche does that well and makes the book worth picking up. However, if you are not particularly enamored of philosophical treatments of our landscape from above or the whys of airplane crashes and other disastors, just skip the second and last chapter. They'll waste your time and make you very sleepy. But then again, maybe you need that."
1,How Can He Fly with His Ego Weighing Him Down,"As I pilot myself I appreciate the beauty of flying. However the author takes an unnecessarily superior, almost professorial, tone with his writing. Flying is a freeing experience that is best described in simple, soaring terms. There is too much ""me"" in this book. Not enough of the true essence of flight."
2,"Interesting perspective, but disjointed","I began my reading of this book with much anticipation, but quickly got lost in the second chapter, which seems totally removed from the rest of the book. While chapters on ""storm flying"" and description of fatal crashes such as ValueJet are fascinating, Langewiesche often launches into opinionated, rambling passages of little relevance to the rest of the story. Just as the pioneering pilots who had few tools to help them navigate, I could not get a sense for where he was trying to go, and felt disappointed at the end of the journey"
2,"Unfocused, thin, and only slightly interesting","Although this book has received glowing reviews from the popular press, I found it did not live up to its billing. I enjoy Mr. Langewiesche's occasional articles in The Atlantic, but this book reads too much like a compilation of those articles. In fact, at least two of the chapters have already been in print. The reviews compare Langewiesche with Saint-Exupery, but Langewiesche is a pale imitator. I just found the chapters too disjointed to get me interested. And his obvious bias against air traffic controllers bothered me. He doesn't seem to like people criticizing pilots if they haven't been one, but he feels free to lace into controllers without having walked a day in their shoes. Overall, a minor book, not one I can recommend."
2,An idiosyncratic and unfocused reflection on flight,"Much like his Sahara Unveiled, the author here uses language beautifully but the book is written in a muted tone, also like Sahara Unveiled. It left me with the vague sense that he is angry. Nonetheless, it will give the non-pilot some sense of the real experience of flight without a lot of new-age adjectives. It contains a long digression on the life of John Jackson by way of expanding on the theme that the orientation to the physical world is changed by its perception from the cockpit. But the digression is a real digression and drags on irrelevantly. His description of why no pilot can fly by the seat of his pants will surprise every non-pilot and is probably worth the price of admission."
2,Uneven collection of one man's flying stories and musings,"Some of the chapters kept me interested, others were a chore to finish. Spends a bit too much time speculating on the thoughts of people he's never met. Sometimes inspiring, sometimes boring."
5,he is bad the Brother has pipes,"from the days of Slave to his solo albums he has had that soulful feel all thru his music.nobody can be you but you,weak at the knees are just some of the jams here.his voice has been weakly emulated by alot of weak singers.not to mention the coutless samples and loops of the music of Slave&Steve's solo output.he deserves some Love.the Brother is Bad.he could rope circles around alot of these Busters out here today.he is a real SoulFul Talent."
5,Works with Macintosh,"This observation would not be worth making, except that the box in which this network card was delivered does not indicate compatibility with Macintosh. Because Windows, Linux, and Novell drivers (but not Macintosh drivers) were included in the box, I had a momentary concern that the product was not Mac-compatible, as represented on this web page.When I installed the card on a Mac G4, however, it worked fine. The G4 picked up a network connection through the card without apparent need for any driver, etc."
2,I just don't get it!,This book was purchased mostly because of very good reveiews at other sites as well as this one. I just don't get it! The story is so beyond belief and more than a little dramatic regarding the upbringing of the heroine by a father who is useless and over the top when it comes to his daughter's well being. The tale of the h/h first meeting is outright silly and the sudden reality of a love for all time is outlandish.To say this author was a disappointment is understated. Unreal is the only thing that comes to mind.
3,Spanish level 3 (lern in Your car),did not receive a reference guide. I need a visual to hear and see what I am listening to.
2,This was a waste of time.,"I am not sure the value of this product.It was boring and made me sleepy while driving.Also I realized that tapes and videos are not really the way to learn a language. But if you heart is set on trying this style of learning, get a library card and just check-out similar tapes and videos.Better yet, go to the country and learn first hand the language, or hire a tutor. Especially with Spanish, so many people would love to share their language.These tapes are just conversational pieces with friends to say you are learning a language. No real educational value here."
4,Great Figure,"Kamakura is a great figure because of all the grear he comes wth. He is durable but the paint on his hands comes off a lot. Still, buy it!"
2,Don't Do It,"Unless you love Jimmy Barnes there is little in this re-take of the classic Dallas Crane track. Dave Larkin and Jimmy Barnes do not make beautiful music together. Their vocal styles do not complement. Buy Twenty Four Seven by Dallas Crane instead. It is a beauty of a record and Sit On My Knee is sung in such a way, it will entice you to sit on Dave's knee."
3,For the real PSB buff,"The video is a collection of short films by Derek Jarman that were projected on screens during the PSBs' first tour. It will be of primary interest to collectors of Jarmaniana and Petbshopboysiana. While visually curious at many points, it occasionally descends to hackneyed; the images in ""It's a sin"" were disappointingly clichéd. The imagery in Paninaro is snickeringly amusing. Summary: buy it if you're a serious fan, otherwise pass."
5,IT WAS WELL DETAILED OF HIS GOOD& BAD TIMES OF HISLIFE!,"MR.ESTRADA SPOKE VERY WELL ABOUT HIS LIFE, HIS UP'S & DOWN'S IN HIS LIFE! I'M SORRY HE WENT THROUGH BAD TIMES, BUT HE HANDLED HIMSELF VERY WELL, AND I'M VERY HAPPY THINGS ARE LOOKING UP FOR HIM & HIS FAMILY! I ALSO THINK IT IS VERY SWEET HOW HE ALWAYS LOOKS OUT FOR HIS MOTHER! THIS BOOK IS SO GOOD, I'M READING IT A SECOND TIME!"
2,Very cool looking,"These subs look amazing and with neon lights they really get your friends attention. However, if your looking for loud or clean bass then forget these subs. The enclosure rattles and although it says its MDF, im pretty sure its particle board. The subs are not polypropylene like advertised. The cone appears to be paper with a hard plastic like coating. It might be polypropylene coated but underneath its paper. I love how these subs look but replaced them with louder and better sounding subs. They are very inefficient as well. They take 250-300w rms but sound like 100w rms or less subs"
4,Good sound with a little defect,ok to start the bass aint bad its well worth the price it gives a nice thump and is good if your looking to upgrade a stock system or just looking for a system on a budgetthe down side would be the led lights do work but the blinking function does not so u either have them on or off but no blinking which aint a major dealall in all its worth getting
1,bad,it is the worse invesment i have done. they do not last and smell like burnfrom the inside get a better brand
2,Cheap sub,had a 1000W kenwood amp on it and it died.. in like a week.. Could smell it burning and it just decided to stop working one day.. Would not buy again
1,Late,This product was bought on the 13th and now its the 15 and it still hasnt shipped yet...wtf i cant believe it would be this slow
4,plastic blocks,"the blocks are good. i was missing some vintage wood ones and ordered these as replacements not knowing they would be plastic. i was disappointed when i realized i wasn't getting wood, but i guess that's the manufacturer's way of dealing with ""progress"""
2,"Cute, but very frustrating","I was excited to try to make a better tasting version of Oreos, Hostess cupcakes, black and white cookies, etc. The oreos came out great, there is certainly a mistake in the amount of liquid needed for the batter for the black and white cookies, and the cupcakes came out totally flat and stuck to the pan! After double checking amounts and technique, redoing the whole thing they are still a mess! I would return this in a minute if it was that easy! A lot of cuteness, but very difficult and inaccurate recipes."
2,Exciting sounding...but a bit of a let-down,"The desserts described in this rather entertaining book are certainly mouth-watering. Although scattered with cute commentary (often very funny!) and interesting bits of information about times gone by, I find the recipes not to be very workable. My biggest pet peave is the 'Black and Whites', our beloved huge New York cookies,soft,lemony and satisfying. The recipe sounds great...but it doesn't work out! The batter spreads too much, so the cookies are very thin and fragile, with no body and the fondant frosting turns out a mess. A chef's book?"
2,"I wanted to like it, but...","I really wanted to love this book. The idea is great, the photos are fantastic, the writing is funny -- but so far, every recipe I have tried has stunk. Some of them didn't work, some of them worked but the result just wasn't that great. I'm glad I have it on my shelf to look at and be inspired by, but I'm not going to cook from it anymore."
1,So I am not the only one that thinks this book stinks,"This book seems like a good idea. So far, I have tried to make the Lemon Pudding Cake, the Grasshopper Pie, and the Strawberry Shortcake. I had to throw the mess out EVERY TIME and start from scratch with my own modified version. This book is horrible!The recipes are just wrong and sometimes poorly written instructions.If I could meet the author, I would demand my money back and then punch him in the face for wasting hours of my time and nearly embarrassing me at my own dinner parties.I was going to donate this book to a charity, but why proliferate the bad recipes and frustrate someone else. I think I will just burn the thing."
4,good book with great food,I've had the book for a couple of years and have made many things out of it. I especailly like the key lime pie. I've only had one problem with one cake falling and it was because I was living at a very high elevation. Otherwise its been a great book. I don't understand why so many people seem to have so much trouble with it.
5,Tom Lehrer Songs,"I listened to Tom Lehrer's songs in the early sixties. I only had them on vinyl, so it is wonderful to have them on a CD now. He was a genius."
5,Best overall selection of Tom Lehrer singing Tom Lehrer!,Great selection of Tom Lehrer songs. Tom Lehrer sings and plays the piano. One of my favorite CD's. Check out the link to book with sheet music and lyrics.Too Many Songs by Tom Lehrer with Not Enough Drawings by Ronald Searle
2,Not The Same,"Buyer beware! Yes, these are the usually great, sometimes brilliant, sometimes annoying Tom Lehrer songs BUT his introductions are gone. These are rather sterile recordings, with no audience reaction and, more importantly, none of the wonderfully funny verbal introductions that were half the fun of Tom Lehrer's music. The songs are there. And most, while not as wonderful without the introductions, do stand on their own. Just know what you're getting."
3,Missing the monologue / introductions - only half the experience,"This is a compilation CD containing songs from Tom Lehrer's first two LPs. It contains a lot of material in one package. Tom Lehrer is brilliant. Unfortunately, the songs alone are only half the experience of listening to him. His original LPs contain satrical monologue introductions to each song which both set the context and, in some cases, are as funny as the songs themselves. They are sorely missed here. For this reason, I can't recommend this particular CD, even though I recommend Tom Lehrer full-heartedly. This CD is only half of Tom Lehrer, so I only gave it half a rating - 3 stars. Do yourself a favor and buy the re-issues of the original LPs to get the full flavor of this artist / satirist."
5,Don't Be Taking a Sip of Anything While Listening!! :),"Our children's piano teacher insisted we hear ""When You Are Old and Grey"" and ""Poisoning Pigeons in the Park."" We didn't laugh at these songs---we HOWLED! My warning to you is this: Don't be drinking anything when you listen to this CD--unless you want whatever you're drinking to be expelled with great force from your mouth and nostrils! These are, without question, the funniest songs we've ever heard, sung with deliberate seriousness though you can HEAR Lehrer smirking. I am here today buying our own CD for home. Great fun, though not songs young children would understand---nor SHOULD they necessarily :)"
4,Tom Lehrer-Satirist Extrordinaire,"I was first introduced to Tom Lehrer's music back in the early 1970's when I was in junior high school-Years later,I started listening to Dr.Demento's weekly show-Lehrer has been an integral part of the program since its inception 30 years ago-Anyway,the songs are brilliant-My favorites are ""We Will All Go Together When We Go"",""Be Prepared"",""The Elements"",& ""Fight Fiercely Harvard""-It's a darn shame that Lehrer got out of the business-We need more topical singer/songwriters of his ilk."
4,old songs,"i really don't have that much to say, but it is like the 45 record my dad bought back in the 1950s."
3,Tom Lehrer,"The songs of Tom Lehrer are part of a classical education: ""Fight fiercely, Harvard,"" and the rest. Keep in mind the ditties come from a less politcally correct era."
4,a moral for our times ???,"I remember listening to this album as a child of 8 to 10 (1960-1962). I'd listen to it by the hour in the basement. My parents would realize what I was doing & then mysteriously, the album would disappear ... until I would find it again, in some remote area of the attic. The phrase that stuck with me the most over the last 35+ years was ... ""and lying she knew was a sin... a sin, a sin, and lying she knew was a sin."""
3,In retrospect.....,"I loved these songs when I was a know-it-all teenager. Now, some are funny and some are dated and some are...well...just snarky and sad.I was surprised in re-listening how few of these songs have any real joy in them. The humor is far blacker than I remember.However, ""The Elements"" is worth the price of admission."
2,Terrbile DVD,"DVD do not work. As earlier reviewers have said the shows do not work. At least you can still get the recipes on the dvd. When you point to an episode it goes back to the main menu without showing the episode. It does not matter what is plays on. I have tried it on my laptop, my desk top, my dvd player and my dvd/blu-ray player. Same thing espisodes do not play."
5,Great CD for the Alabama fan,My hubby loves this CD. He is a huge Alabama fan and he listens to this one a lot. I recommend this as a great gift for anyone who is an Alabama fan and the price isn't bad for all the tracks you get.
3,Cowgirl,This was for my great grand daughter in Calf. She rides a little pony out there and she just loved the little outfit.
5,Sweet as Sugar,"Ok, boy bands move over, a true male vocalist has arrived. Don Philip has the talent, the look, the moves and the soul to be a truly great artist. Although in actuality this CD-single should probably be a 4, his potential got him the extra star. He has so much room to grow even though he is fabulous as is!!"
3,Master of Desire,"This was a very easy read. The characters weren't overly complicated and the plot was just ok. Usually in this type of genre, I read Virginia Henley or Nicole Jordan and their books just seemed to have more depth compared to Jessica Trapp's writing style. It's probably a book that I will not read again."
1,Very Out of Date and Incomplete,"I spent two months in Shanghai this year and found this book to be totally out of date and full of erroneous and incomplete information. Virtually every phone number was wrong (I called the number for the Shanghai Acrobats and it was someone's home, I went to the location listed and it was a supermarket; I called every travel agency listed to arrange for travel tickets and all were wrong as well), information such as extending a tourist visa was incomplete, information about the easy to use subway was lacking. Many fun things to do are not mentioned (try seeing the Shanghai Sharks if you enjoy basketball or visit Circus World) and it never mentions many of the fabulous local restaurants but instead focuses on tourist and western style restaurants. It reports that shopping in not good, but I found the shopping to be excellent if you know where to go and this book is no help at all. Bottom line, wait until it is updated."
5,An Album Essential To Your Music Collection,"How can I possibly describe this beautiful talent to you and have you fully understand and grasp its' magnitude? True North, Fisher's first official label release, is full of creative and original writing as well as outstanding musical orchestration. This album is unlike anything I have ever heard before. Fisher is one of the few artists where I can put on her album and let it play for days and days nonstop without ever tiring of it. This is the type of music and writing where you find something brand new to connect with each time you listen to it. Kathy Fisher's vocals are blissful and serene, yet powerful and confident in the same breath. She really has a wonderful way of pulling her listener directly into her music. Grabbing on to your heart and ears, she will make you a life-long devoted listener and fan. Listen to True North and look forward to entering a whole new realm of musical talent."
5,hauntingly beautiful!,"simply haunting...if you like dido,tori amos,poe,nina gordon,or even sarah mclachlan...you will fall in love with fisher...i just bought her cd less than 24 hours ago...and it hasnt come out of my cd player yet...and i dont expect it to for quite some time!unlike most cds on this one you dont have to skip anysongs to get to the one you like...they are all equally good...although you will have your fav's...mine are:hello,its me,anyway,never say never{awsome back ground beats},miseryland{just the best},i will love you{reason i bought the album!}...if these arnt enough reasons to go pick her cd up...you need to get some musical taste!;)"
4,Sarah McClachlan Fans Come and Enjoy,"OK, so Fisher isn't exactly like Sarah, but as a big fan of hers and someone who always has to wait such a long time for good music, finding Fisher was a godsend and has filled my CD player for months. I actually picked up this CD (and a Beth Orton one) thanks to a friend of mine who said I would love the mixture of lilting piano melodies and a deep beautiful voice. The first song, 'Hello, It's Me,' starts the album off with an emphatic bang, as FIsher welcomes us to her musical world and talents. I love this album. It's pretty steady all the way through so you can listen to it over and over again."
2,Average Pop,"I picked up this cd after hearing the first single, which I really like a lot, but I'm disappointed in MOST of the rest of it. I like about half the songs on there which is definitely a good record compared to most new music. But there's a lot of sameness and just songs that have no ""weight."" It's a fine pop record, but not anything that really stays with you. And the vocals need more variety or something."
2,"New album, 80% old songs","This is supposed to be a new album and expectations were high as her first CD was really great, a very special artist. Receiveing the new CD, it is a great dissapointment to find that 8 of the 13 tracks are re-recordings of her first album.The new stuff is not up to the expectations created by the brilliant first CD.Better luck next time, and get better advice"
2,ALANIS-LITE,"I had seen something about this group posted on-line and decided to get the disc. It's good, not great. Very Alanis, but more Adult Contemporary. Basic pop record - some nice ballads, but a little on the school-girl-diary side. Fine, but it's not something for repeated listening. Vocals get annoying. I'd say 2 & 1/2 stars."
5,Soon To Win the Best New Artsist Grammy,"I first ran across Fisher quite by accident near a year ago, and in the first half of the song ""The Life"" had fallen in love with her voice and the music. The content and musical capabilities of the duo are phenomenal. From more techno driven pieces like ""the Life"" to more traditional piano ballads like ""I will Live You"" she evinces in her direct, and poingnat lyrics a range of emotions and personal subjects that any of us can relate to. This album is a fine showcase of a new artists work, expressing itself in beautifully perfect tones. I do belive this duo will make an impact upon the music scene, and though comparisons to Sarah McLachlan and Tori Amos are inevitable Kathy Fisher is most defintly her own voice (literaly and figureativly)."
5,An Underrated Soul Classic!,"Anyone who grew up listening to R&B station know more than the one pop crossover hit, Natural High. I recently saw Bloodstone perform in July '08 and even though they were opening for '70 Soul Greats, the Main Ingredient, Chi Lites and Stylistics these guys stole the show for me. Highlights on this CD include the classic, Natural High, Outside Women, Give Me Your Heart, We Go A Long Way Back, My Little Lady, That's Not How It Goes and Traffic Cop. This was a group with some of the most outstanding vocalist of the day and today who could sing just about anything and make it sound good. Don't pass up on this one."
3,[Procurer] on parade,"Sorry ! That's what the album cover reminds me of . Cool album ...really takes you back, makes you feel REALLY old . ""Natural High"" is an uncredited 70's classic ... if you look on any album that's suppose to be the best of 70's soul, this song usually isn't listed . The rest is kinda filler but still good 70's soul ."
3,Don't buy unless you have a G4 or G5 system!,"I'm sure this is a nice suite of programs from Apple. I love my Mac but cannot install the full program on my (now) puny 400 MHz G3 iMac - the slowest system it can work on. It requires 4.67GB on your startup disk. That's half of my almost full harddrive! And the installer won't allow it to be installed on an external drive. I've got lots of space there! Must be on startup disk. Dang.... GarageBand also doesn't work on a G3 system like mine. iPhoto 5 on a G3 system leaves off the advanced editing tools. So, be very careful about ordering this. Read the fine print about system requirements. I am very disappointed. Oh well, it's almost time to buy that G5 iMac with the 20"" lcd."
3,iLife 04 vs iLife 05,I purchased iLife 05 since it was touted as a major advance over iLife 04. I really wanted only iPhoto but the rest came with it. I found that there is an improvement in the editing capability in iPhoto 05. IPhoto is an excellent program for photo processing but the advances in 05 over 04 are really not worth the $70.00.
1,Ordered wrong item,"I wanted to order the latest Mac version of iLife. Upon receiving your Email solicitation, I automaticaqlly selected the first iLife item that appeared on Amazon's page. Unfortunately, it was for iLife '05, rather than iLife '06. Since I already had iLife'05, I had to send it back and reorder iLife '06. To Amazon, I recommend you feature the latest version of the product and list the discounted older version thereafter. To us Buyers, i've learned to be more aware and detailed in my ordering. It saves everyone a lot of pain and suffering."
5,wow...,"whatever you do, see this movie. any way you can. SEE THIS MOVIE! if it doesnt totally blow your mind, it will at least provide some very interesting things to ponder or research. this movie gave me the feeling, ""god, a lot of this is new to me, but i feel like ive known this all along."". this movie explores the fundimental questions of human nature, and weaves science and spirituality together perfectly. quantum mechanics can explain human consiousness? this film sure makes you think so! go ahead, treat yourself! let this movie serve as a reminder of your great capability with this life you have chosen. you create your own reality. think for yourself, quesiton authority."
1,Made me want to claw my eyeballs out,"I'm a man of science. I totally buy in to the idea that quantum mechanics tries to explain that which today is inexplicable. This movie, though, literally made me want to never interact with anyone in the human race again. The band of scientists and theorists they pulled together would make for an interesting panel discussion, but the story that was woven from their thoughts was uninteresting, and irrelevant. I feel cheated out of 109 minutes of my life that I'll never get back."
1,This movie made me sick,"This movie was scary and made me dizzy. I watch it when I do my pull-ups cause it's like Rocky V and makes you better than other bad men who come to do the bad things. The cartoons make me dizzy, and this movie is great and says I'm special cause I was bad a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, time ago and now Im bein' pun-ish'd! I watch this over and over and every time I watch it, it makes me better cos it's got the magic in there, you see. It was really sad when Rocky didn't get to go on the motorcycle trip through europe because he looked like a lion and his mom was busy with strange men. This movie is the best and gets one star for number one.....Next time use the stooges on your sound-track, cos nobody rocks harder."
1,P.T. Barnum was right!,"Maybe it's not fair to review a film that you did not watch in its entirety, but 40 minutes was about as much as I could stand of this malarkey. Between the atrocious acting, the annoying ""outer space"" animations, and the breathlessly, self-important ""deep thoughts""-- well, that's 40 minutes of my life I'll never get back. The good news is that I borrowed it from the library rather than spent money to rent it or (god forbid) buy it."
1,One of the worst movies ever made!,"This should be entitled ""Why the Bleep Should We Watch?"" I had read about it online and saw it in the theater. It has choppy editing, a poorly written story interspersed with interviews with various ""experts"" who are inadequately identified, cartoon animations, and a scattershot approach to some very interesting concepts mixed in with new age blather. If you are at all interested in quantum physics, self-help, body-mind connections or any new age religious practices you probably already know more than this movie tells you. My advice? Go read a book!"
1,I haven't received my purchase yet.,"I haven't received my purchase yet and I pay for the delivery service. I want my movie or my money back.Best regards,Tomás López."
2,BORING,So very sad that this wasn't more exciting. I'm glad I rented it instead of purchasing. Its too bad...I was looking forward to an interesting film on the subject.
1,This Is My First Review on Amazon,I took the pain to write this review to warn others NOT TO WASTE THEIR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. It is a movie about a polish wedding and people getting drunk and disinhibited.I am still so disturbed by this movie that I felt I need to write something.
1,The worst film ever made. I am not joking,As a film & video Editor for a Television station. I was and still am astounded that such a terrible Mish Mash of a film was spoken about in such High Regard and Hushed tones.I felt it had Cult connatations running through it.I found it completely offensive and anybody who has seen it and liked it should take a good hard look at themselves in a tall mirror and wake up. New Age Garbage. You have been warned
2,be careful,"I have discovered that this flick is a recruiting instrument for a ""spiritual"" religious cult. Creative, but specifically looking for lost souls who need somewhere to turn. Legitimate reviews of this movie have ridiculed the misrepresentation of the science and thrown light on the hidden agenda. And, by the way, I do not believe the world is only 6000 years old. One doesn't have to be a brainwashed bible thumper to see through this one."
1,Quatum physics? No Way,"Peptides are NOT quantum particles! And this movie is not Reality! Start with a good idea, back it up with stupid, made up non-physics and it is no longer a good idea. A chance wasted."
1,Do you belive in science?,"This is a classic example of the kind of pseudo-science that has convinced so many to waste their time and energy in persuit of vague metaphysical concepts that conveniently enough are of the nature that they cannot be tested or proven. The movie is teeming with scientific half truths that a well-read armchair scientist could see through. Read some of the books mentioned in the movie and you will quickly see that the information is being taken out of context. Also, there are countless blatant contradictions and bold ascertations given without a source, reference, or even a shred of logical proof applied. If you belive in science then you have got to realize that this movie is total crap."
3,great movie,"it's a very holistic movie.You have to truly understand what the concept is about, other than just watching the movie."
5,What The Bleep Do We Know,"I saw this documentary back in 2004, when it first came out in theatres. It definitely explains a lot and is a must have for anyone interested in the mystery of life. It's the Discovery Channel on steroids."
4,What the Bleep Do We Know?,"Deep....Very deep. Thought provoking, sometime to much (thank God for rewind). I reconmend it to anyone."
1,geesh!,"I went to see this one night when I was bored, and it looked offbeat and interesting. Plus I'm interested in quantum theory and know something about it. Well, this movie failed to entertain, failed to give even a decent idea about what quantum physics is about, featured boring inconclusive generalized talk about life etc. I couldn't stand to get to the end. There was 5 minutes of animation that was ok, and the wedding scene promised to be better, but fizzled. I can't think of anything else that even is worth mentioning about it. It might be better if you were were high on some drug, or otherwise ""non compus mentis"". Bad movie."
1,"Religious nuts corrupt science, Vol. 1","I honestly feel sorry for people who can get sucked in by this sort of thing, quantumn physics is a thought excercise to explain the behaviour of sub atomic particles, not explain the existance of god!Complete waste of time, I had to turn it off half way through."
1,"Laughable,comedy,humor",Far from the truth....it has a shock me into the the belief of why we are here and the explaination of life or so called life.Completely absurd and has no scientific value.
1,Follow this if you can!!,"A more fitting title might be...'What the bleep is going on'!?A seriously plumped up over rated strange film that doesn't prove or explain jot! Save yourself some money, and just go and have a meditate, it'll be way more beneficial than watching this movie."
2,Spit it out and read a book.,"This film is a distasteful blend of real neuroscience, confused and misleading quantum physics, and outright falsehoods.If you are a new-agey, ""crystals and Atlantis"" type who looks scornfully on science as something cold and cruel, you may get the impression from this film that there is room for your belief system in the scientific worldview after all. And if you did get that impression, you would almost certainly be wrong.If you are a skeptical person with above-average knowledge of quantum physics and neuroscience, this movie will make you cringe with its clumsy language and refusal to back up any of its claims, whether factual or insane, with references to valid experimental data.Let me put it this way: If you want to learn about the implications of quantum physics as it relates to cognition, there are good books on the topic, without a bunch of unscientific nonsense about the emotions of a glass of water, and how nothing really exists outside your head."
1,"Clever at times, well produced, but ultimately silly and baseless. It sounds like a cult infomercial.","This sounds like some strange late night infomerical for a weird cult or something. The whole thing about drawing positive forces towards you, or whatever ""secret"" sort of rubbish they go on about is just that - rubbish. There is nothing real here, nothing truly spiritual, nor is there anything that stands up to real science. All this makes it a big waste of time. Its pseudoscience for people who are looking in the wrong direction for meaning and purpose and the answers to life's basic questions. They will not find those answers here."
1,Evidently not that much - New Age masquerading as physics,Bunch of pseudo-scientific mysticism that really doesn't amount to anything. You are much better off reading some real science books that describe the new physics.
4,What the Bleep Do we know....was excellent,"I found it very sprititually captivating. It made me think very hard about quantum physics and how they come to play a part in our lives. Also, how the way our negitive thoughts linger in our minds and if we dont let them go we will go on living an unhappy life. We become that negitive energy and it takes us over. Marley did an excellent job. There is so much to it I would like to see it again to grasp more of it."
3,Poor referral from 1st Class,I met a wonderfully bright and articulate person in first class flying across the country and this DVD entered the conversation. I wish I would have just taken her points and notes and left it at that. People that try to go too deep must remember there's a risk of getting stuck.
1,new age non-sense charaded as hip and scientific,"Pseudo-scientific, New Age non-sense. Taking an otherwise serious and highly respected branch of physics, and decorating it with pure New Age nonsense. Be skeptical, be aware."
1,"Absolute rubbish & hokey ""science""","Paid for and starring members of ""The School of Enlightenment"" via Ramtha, a 35,000 year old male warrior spirit from Atlantis, who is supposedly being channeled through JZ Knight. Only one ""expert"" presented is not a member of the school and he claims his words were completely chopped up and mixed from a 4 hour interview.If you really want to know what your dealing with, go here: www.ramtha.comThis movie has taken up 110 minutes of my life & I want Ramtha to give it back. LOL"
1,"What the ""Bleep"" is this movie?","Ok now we are going to look at quantum physics and tell you what is wrong? I felt like this movie was somehow trying to hypnotize the viewer.. I lasted about 7 minutes and 32 seconds before realizing how fun this DVD was to throw.... so for that I give the 1 star ... because, come on, throwing things is fun ..."
1,Just silly!,I am a devout follower of the the Law of Attraction. I read almost everything on the subject I can get my hands on. But this movie is just plain silly. I have to be honest and say I haven't watched the whole thing because I couldn't get through it - TWICE! One of the most annoying things for me was the some arrogant woman who believes she channels some long dead Atlantian. (I'm rolling my eyes!) The Law of Attraction is THOUGHT combined with ACTION. There are so many better sources of information on the subject out there. I cringe to think of people unfamiliar with the subject watching this for the first time and seeing all these goofballs. Its hollywood silliness as far as I'm concerned.
3,more spiritualism propaganda than real science but interesting.,"It is an odd DVD, to say the least.It looks, from the start to be a piece of science reporting to the masses. Like PBS's special on quantum nature a few months back. But watching the whole thing and maybe 1/2 of the interviews it becomes more obvious that it really isn't science, but uses science to make a spiritual point.Is the spiritualism types of points right or true? i don't think so, but that really isn't the point. The point is trying to pass off science and it's authority in the service of spirit possession and 40K year old avatars.Look at who made the DVD, look at a few good science books on the topic. Most of the film is pure speculation dressed up as physics. Shame on you, present things for what they are, not clothed in borrowed rags."
1,What the bleep were they smoking!?,"As an undergraduate engineer who has taken several quantum mechanics courses (and has derived the wave equation for a particle in a box in 3 dimensions), I cringed through this entire movie. They managed to pay some educated people to pervert quantum mechanics into an absurd fantasy.I was surprised to see the credentials of some of the interviewees, until I figured out the filmmakers' strategy. They would use the professors to state the ""borderline"" BS, like stretching and distorting the statements of quantum mechanics, and use the crazy woman and the chiropractor to say the REALLY crazy stuff (""we are all gods"").This whole film is a big rip off of the ""Nova"" episodes on string theory, and ""The Matrix"". (They aimed to emulate the profoundess of Matrix 1, but only managed to create the WTF-ness of 2 and 3).Its alright if spiritualism makes you feel good about yourself, but don't try to justify it with science because its NOT."
2,Highly overrated,"Okay look. I saw this movie at McMenamin's Bagdad Theater in Portland - the same theater featured prominently in the film - during what seemed like an eternal run there. But even with the added weirdness of seeing the theater I was sitting in up there on the screen, this movie still didn't do it for me. Maybe it was putting a ""35,000 year old soul"" alongside so-called scientists, then affording them exactly equal weight and credence. Or maybe it was the dozens of other similar loopy concepts. The bottom line is, I really wanted to love this thing. But I just couldn't. Buy or rent I `Heart' Huckabees instead. (Check out the commentaries too.) It's at least as intellectually challenging. And it's entertaining."
1,Ooogie Boogie boogie !!!,"This work is 2% science and 98% CRACK. If you like sham religion telling you what to think about the world around you, then this is for you! Sit back, relax, and sink into oblivion. As for all the 5 star reviews..... EVERYBODY needs to believe in SOMETHING."
1,"""What the bleep do we know"" is the right title.","This ""film"" is joke. The film is filled with junk science and ""scientists"". The fact that so many high ratings for this film exist is scary. It's sad proof that the public will believe anything if you package it correctly. There are so many factual errors in the film that I will not go into listing them here. Please, if you are going to learn about real quantum theory and physics, this is the last place you want to look."
5,A little story for ya..,"My psychology teacher put this film into the DVD player the other day.I have proceeded to...1.Improve eye/hand coordination2.Slow down my thinking3.Eliminate road rage4.Gain more control of my emotions5.Eliminate speech anxiety completely with one speech6.Change my paradigm about algebra, rather than fear it7.Control my own realityAt the age of 42, all this doesn't come overnight...or does it?We're all God, and indeed connected. That's the trick to this damn thing."
1,What the bleep indeed,"This film could have been so much more. Instead we have a boring 'after school special' with some thought provoking interviews peppered throughout. Sure, our thoughts can change us and the world around us. I agree. Got it.I just wish there would have been two of me so the other one could have watched something interesting."
1,You must be bleeping kidding me...,"Anyone who even has a basic understanding of quantum physics knows that most of this film is an extreme misrepresentation of the truth. The fact that this film claims to have experts in these fields is ridiculous. Just look at who most of the speakers are. These people have an agenda, and it is not a purely scientific one. Simply put, the film is propaganda in its basest form, working for some metaphysical pseudoscience. Real scientists are certainly rolling on the floor laughing at this joke of a film."
1,Psuedoscientific nonsense,"This movie starts with a specific worldview (We can alter our internal chemistry / biology and the world around us by our emotions and outlook). It then contrives a pseudoscientific approach to explain this dubious claim misapplying and distorting concepts of quantum physics and biology. It is hard to convey how painful sitting through this is. I highly recommend you do not attempt this at home!If you want to get a basic understanding of quantum physics, I recommend ""The Elegant Universe""."
3,A Very Mixed Bag,"At the very least, this DVD set will provoke an emotional response and get you to think about it. It is doubtful you will be wishy washy. This is metaphysics meets cognitive behavioral therapy. It is science meeting spirituality. The theme is that quantum mechanics is relevant to your day to day life. You'll have to make up your own mind. Do you in essence create your reality by your thinking and expectations? Many honchos of the new age world and numerous scientists give you their take on this. My guess is that much was edited out to get you to think in the way the movie suggests you should. It may not be rocket science and it may not even be quantum physics, but it is interesting and worth taking a look."
2,"Well, not that","This movie presents an odd mix - a positive personal outlook with scientific substrate. The writers draw on brain imagining, neurochemistry, and quantum physics. Using those bases, they describe how the intention to feel a certain way or to have specific events occur comes from a personal choice. That in turn changes the body, the physical substance of the mind, to reinforce those feelings. It's a positive and empowering message.The problem is, they distort or simply invent the science to support their message. Yes, in a common interpretation, the quantum wave function collapses when the observer measures the phenomenon (creating profound philosophical quandaries). That does not imply that happy thoughts affect the outcome of that collapse. There's some unsound biology, as well, too much to go into.On the whole, this comes across as a gram of genuine fact diluted in liters of wishful thinking.-- wiredweird"
4,"Provocative is okay, too.","Obviously, this movie succeeded in touching the nerves of more than a few people. Fortunately, no one has a monopoly on ""far out"" hypotheses as evidenced by the many passionate members of the ""Flat Earth Society."" And, there are still people who deny fossil evidence of prehistoric life forms. Without the work of such ""nut cases"" as Edison, Marconi, and Edward Acheson none of the 209 people who offered their opinions here would have had the platform to do it. If provoking thought was the producers goal I would suggest that ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" was a resounding success. The level of thought this movie provokes is another matter. We would do well to beware of the ""true believer,"" in whatever dimension we may find them. I am astounded at the number of ""true believers"" who quote the writing of other ""true believers"" as necessary and sufficient evidence to prove their hypothesis. What the Bleep do they know?"
1,Two Dimensional - (aka - Not All That!),"There are a couple of problems with this metaphysical new age movie. the main character, Amanda, is so two-dimensional and the film itself is so tedious that despite its boasting of many dimensions its spirituality comes off as .... well,.. two-dimensional!Also, ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"" takes some cheap shots at mainstream christianity - which was not exactly necessary for this film.Your better off watching the 'Star Wars' movies and learning about the ""Force"" with much more interesting (three dimensional) characters and probably with better results,... and not to mention, their alot more fun to watch!Peace out & cheers-CrowTurtle"
1,This Move is Not Science ! It's BS !,"This movie is neither a documentary nor scientific. I am a physicist and have studied quantum mechanics. This movie is a new age recruitment video that preys on the average unscientific thinker. People watch this movie, think they are learning physics, and think that it connects to the spiritual world. Go read a book about physics rather than watch this cultish, pseudo-science, touchy-feely mocumentary."
1,Ouch - What the F*** is this,"As a physicist who has studied Quantum Physics I can quite definitievly say that this film is crap from one end to where I stopped watching it out of sheer frustration.The basic premise of this movie seems to be to prove new age mysticism and a single god called the ultimate observer. The makers of this movie have little knowledge of the field and have edited the experts to give the solution that they, the producers, want. If you liked ""The Secret"" then you will love this film, else you should avoid it."
2,read a quantum physics book instead,"this movie will get you fired up about science, which is good. go read a book about it. but this movie is full of half-facts and distorted truths. EXTREMELY unscientific. EXTREMELY. i cannot stress that enough. worth a watch, just to raise questions. QUESTION EVERYTHING IN THIS MOVIE. any scientist in the whole world will tell you not to believe the results of ONE study. single studies are bullhockey. they like to reference a lot of studies that were only conducted once (maybe they're leaving out reproductions that proved them wrong...)"
5,For those with ears to hear and eyes to see,Some may be offended by this movie - GOOD!It's time for the world to wake up and move into a new era.The concepts are the whole point of this movie. If you don't like the concepts then I'm sorry but you are not ready for them.This movie will resonate with those of you who are ready to hear.For those who are not you can go back to watching Michael Jackson trials and Fear Factor.
5,Amazing & Provacative,"This movie is so incredibly thought provoking if you let it sink in and really try to grasp the concept of it. I would never impose my thoughts or feelings on anyone but if you want to understand your life and the role you play in not only your own universe, but the universe as a whole, it provides a myriad of answers. If you're into the study of Law of Attraction and want to intentionally create a better world for yourself and those around you, check this movie out. It is more of a documentary than a 'drama' (as it is listed under this category). While there is a fictional story to follow with the lead character, played by Marlee Matlin, the majority of the film is a series of commentary from experts within the fields of quantum physics. This particular version ...""Down the Rabbit Hole""...is more insightful than the original movie which is slightly dated."
4,Question reality and this movie.,"I like this movie, but you should know where it comes from before judging its ideas. [...]. It seems that a cult/sect is behind it and some of the scientist aren't much of scientists and other scientists are misrepresented. Still some good idea to live by, but also mixed in with mystic garbage that is as unbelievable as the fundamentalist religion that the movie critiques."
5,Looking down the rabbit hole,Its a great movie. It really challenges one to look beyond...What IF..............
5,Change your belief system,"If you sometimes want to give up on the world, buy this movie. I watch it over and over again because it is inspiring and hopeful. You will definitely want it in your library."
2,Don't hate. . .,"At least these guys went out and created something, now it's surpassed all expectation in sales. That's amazing. The bigger it gets, the more validity it will have, so don't hate. Hop on board. Lot's of cute chicks dig this movie, and so what if their not all right in the head?It only takes one thought for a man to have an erection. . .Well that depends on the thought, but the Sally Struthers clone does have a point, regardless of her ability to create that reality herself. Although, if she is a she-male, as rumour has it, then she probably speaks from experience. Decent comedy/fantasy, doesn't quite pull it off. . .Definitely a rental, tops."
1,Ramtha is not a major character!,"Rama is the embodiment of the knight, the first chivalry. He was at first an ascetic, banished by his father, but his main action was in life. ""The life of Rama suggests that, spiritual strife apart, the struggle in the world is the first thing to face; and if one keeps to one's own ideal through every test and trial in life, one will no doubt arrive at a stage when he will be victorious. It does not matter how small be the struggle, but victory won in the end of every struggle is the power that leads man farther on the path towards life's goal. The life of man, however great and spiritual, has its limitations. Before conditions of life the greatest man on earth, the most powerful soul, will for a moment seem helpless. This video doesn't have enough Rama!"
2,Not as good as expected,"A couple of acquaintances raved about this movie, so I bought it without reading any reviews. My mother and I both tried very hard to get into it, but after 45 minutes of silliness we gave up. I gave it two stars instead of one because at least it seemed earnest. I didn't know this was the output of some cult ideas, but I do know that it was amateurish, often incoherent and well...dull. Perhaps my acquaintances were high when they were watching it? That might make it more tolerable."
3,Opens your mind,This movie will change the way you think. It was very fascinating and absorbing. Gives you details of how the universe and all humans function. Though to be honest I was expecting slightly more. Some parts of the movie get a bit dragging. But on the whole its not bad. Normally I see movies 2 or 3 times. So far I have seen this once.
5,Amazing Movie,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie. It sounded interesting but strange. It blew me away! To hear so many prestigous, intelligent, science oriented people concur with the likes of Ramtha was astounding. See this movie if you're an atheist, an agnostic, a Moslem, a Buddhist, a Christian. See this movie."
1,Pedantic. Boring. Human Potential Hogwash Masquerading As Deep Thought.,"Wow. This movie came out and I read reviews that praised it highly. I cannot see why. This movie is like watching a scientology video. The movie was presented to be scientific. It is instead a mish-mash of new age practitioners and academics that are presenting sophistry as science. All within a cheesy story line and laughable special effects. The story was a joke and the science was unscientific. Therefore it will find its way into high school science classes. Save yourself the trouble. If you want to know more about the scientific theories, go read a book, and rent a comedy. That way you will be laughing at the story rather than this movies hilariously poor production value and script."
1,This movie is a Sales Pitch,"Science is used as nice window dressing here. But ultimately this movie is a sales pitch for cheesy fringe new age gurus who make MEGA bucks from their business in selling spirituality. The shame is that one or two respected scientists agreed to be involved with the making of this film. It's a con. Capitol C.The film never once identifies the large blond woman dressed in Captain Kirk's caste offs. (JZ Knight, who caims to channel a spirit from Atlantis) Anybody telling you there's no such thing as good, no such thing as bad... there's a hidden agenda there. Just close your eyes, bliss out, and send in those dollars. This film could be the pilot episode for a whole fresh season of TV tele-newvangelists."
5,Where science & spirituality meet,"This is an amazing look at the way our intentions and thoughts create our reality. If you are looking for any new information about creating your future this is it. Even the most sceptical of people will be inthrawled with these scientific masters and their perceptions of reality. I suggest everyone watch this as it leaves little doubt to the next step in human evolution, the power of thought. The possibilities are endless."
1,Vile Piece of Trash- WORST MOVIE EVER,"Ahhhh Ramtha. What a joke. This movie is channeled through a red headed freak, from this ancient joke of a god. They butchered segments so as to present ""supporting evidence"" from ""scientists"". Trash. Those scandalous culty buggers. The acting is the worst i've ever seen, Marlee give me a break baby girl, and the animation illustrating the magical possibilities of every day IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS WASTE OF TIME I'VE EVER HAD TO ENDURE. I would sooner peel my face off with a spoon before watching this again. I am an astrally minded girl, friend of physics <we go way back> and thusly bamboozled. Save yourself, read a real book or watch a real documentary. Hell, even a real cartoon. RAMTHA IS A SHAM."
5,I can't understand how anyone could try to discredit this movie!,"This entire film is pure fact. I can understand the disbelief about the indian chief bit, but it is a story merely to help further implant the idea they are trying to explain. Aside from this, everything has been proven hundreds of times. This is a very inspirational film backed by proven scientific facts. This movie has the ability to change someone's life in one sitting. I couldn't count how many times I have seen this movie yet its still seems new every time I watch it. Highly recommended!"
5,dr. jane's opinion,"This is an extremely interesting DVD. It makes you look at what we consider reality in a whole new light. Fascinating visual images--the presentation took and held my attention fully. Unfortunately, I have yet to see the last third or so; I had borrowed the DVD from a friend and misplaced it. So I will have to borrow this replacement one and be more careful! And then I plan to purchase the later version for myself."
4,Questionable science at times but metaphysically intriguing,"I have studied Tibetan Buddhism for 12 years and Psychics for 5. This movie tries to bring the two into some cohesive discipline and often provides questionable actual science. But, its asking really interesting questions and looking for deeper answers into our reality. I think it is a good place to be exposed to so new ideas about our lives and surroundings. I still feel that the best place to start with these ideas might be the sources: Ancient Eastern and Tibetan teachings, Mystical western sources and actual physics."
1,Disingenuous Drivel,"I was duped. I want my money back. This steaming pile of dreck was marketed as a documentary about quantum physics and it was really a brainwashing piece for charlatans like ""Ramatha"" aka J.Z.Knight.Quantum physics is indeed wonderful and exhibits properties that are nonsensical to our everyday senses. BUT.........That doesn't mean it has ANYTHING to do with human consciousness, alternate consciousness or the sexual ""energies"" of Ramtha and her drooling minions.This is bad.Like Scientology.A perversion of science to the adgendas of the lunatic fringe.Avoid. I beg you."
4,the only proof..,"the water experiments in this movie is the only physical proof i've seen of god..this movie will floor you..entertaining and educational...but, it kind of leaves me with a ""now what"" feeling - there are so many good books to answer that question - my new fav is Live Like A Fruit Fly on amazon."
1,"Okay, but I would rather they left their prejudice at home.","Okay, I liked the movie for the most part right up to the point where some of the people who speak decided they'd trot out their petty gripes about religion and philosophy they didn't like. That pretty much ruined it for me.It's not that I disagree with what they said, but I disagree with it when they are trying to teach about the value of love. As far as I'm concerned they invalidated everything they said by bringing it up. If you can't stand on your own without putting someone else down, have you even reached higher, or have you just lowered everyone else to your level?"
2,Sweetness without substance,"Oh dear this is such a cleverly dressed misrepresentation of current physics that it has beguiled many in the audience. The work of people like Dr Tiller has no scientific basis, yet is presented with the same authority as famous historic experiments. The ideas are perhaps appealing but alas that should not form the basis for deeming them true. I fear those who have thought this DVD provides some inspiring new worldview are happily ignorant of the underlying science."
4,Very Interesting and Mind Captivating,"Yea this movie came up with many different concepts, im not all 2familar with quantum physics and the whole 9 yards, SOme of the ideas may sound a lttle nutty, Its either possible or not, There are an infinite number of possiblites in the Universe And beyond, which i dont think we could ever find out,its good everyone sohuld pick it up and give it a look, But hey what the bleep Do i knoe."
1,We know a lot more than this...,"I bought this dvd based on a second hand recommendation that made it sound thoughtful and intriguing. I watched it twice... the second time because I wanted to make sure it was really as bad as I thought it to be the first time through. Its worse.This piece of drivel is a travesty of smarmy pseudoscience that makes me cringe at the state of general sceientific sophistication of the American public. But why should this be a surprise, given that the teaching of ""Intelligent Design"" is now sanctioned by law in some states?After the second watching, I threw it in the trash, but not before actually destroying the disc to make sure there was no chance of polluting a naive garbage-picker who might just have a dvd player.Don't say you weren't warned."
1,Heart Bleeps----What the?,"Pure entertainment is not an egotistical lady singing boring songs onstage for two hours and people in tuxes clapping whether they like it or not. It's the real performers on the street who can hold people's attention and keep them from walking away. This dvd is so frightfully bad you cannot possibly run away fast enough, but will try your damnedest nonetheless."
2,Fancy ideas don't equal wisdom,"It's a sad, sad day when we need ""insights"" about quantum mechanics and microbiology to ""understand"" reality. All this film does is demonstrate how backwards we are.There can be no doubt about the fundamental harmony of science and religion, nor the consequences of past events on the present. But to provide a proof of these self-evident ideas with ""quantum mechanics"" is just embarrasing. The vast majority of people on this planet will never grasp these abstruse sciences, and yet they will live happier and more meanful lives than we enlightened few."
1,Completely Dishonest!,"David Alpert states that this ""documentary""completely misrepresented his views throughselective editing (""in the movie, my viewsare turned around 180 degrees""). Just doa search for the article on Ramtha byChris Lydgate, it's available on a fewdifferent sites."
1,Utter Garbage,"This movie is utter garbage and utter nonsense, as are most of the reviews here on Amazon of it. I truly hate to see actual scientific concepts ""hijacked"" by quasi-religious wackos and frauds who have no idea what they're talking about. Suffice to say if you want to learn ANYTHING of value about quantum ANYTHING, stick with the scientists. As an antidote to the sickness of this movie, I recommend ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Green, which is all about string theory, but gives an excellent accounting of quantum physics and special and general relativity along the way.As I say, if you want to learn about the world, choose science. The idiots in this movie are doing nothing except talking through their a**es."
