3,IT's ok,I though it would go more into detail but it didnt it wasnt that horrible but it could of been better..They did use Smells like teen spirit in it so that gave it an extra star.
2,Disappointing,"Unlike the reviewer from Kirkus, I found this to be an incredible disappointment after the taut and entertaining events of the previous novel. I had enjoyed all three novels to this point, but from here it seems to me that the impetus of the original idea was lost, leaving Wingrove to fulfill a contract that he had little heart to do. I could, of course, be completely wrong (it wouldn't be the first time) but from here on in the series Wingrove seems to lose all idea of character development - they all seem to do things on whims that fulfill the author's purpose (whatever that is) rather than operating as believable (albeit archetypal) individuals."
2,The fall of the seven,"While I still finished the book, the stereotypical characterisations and lack of coherant editing makes me question bothering to continue reading the series."
3,ocusoft mascara,This mascara is good for sensitive eyes but does not do much for the eyelash... It does not thicken or lenthen the eyelashes.
1,Very difficult to remove,"I bought this mascara because I have very sensitive eyes and I thought it was non-irritating. However, my eyes were still irritated but the worst part is that it was very difficult to remove. I had to use eye makeup remover twice to try to get it all off and it still looked like a bit of it was remaining as a smudged area under my lower lashes. A gentle, non-irritating mascara should also be easy to remove and this wasn't. I will continue my search for a non-irritating mascara that is easy to remove."
4,Very good product.,"This item is perfect for what it claims it will do. It's simple plug and play operation is excellent. If you need more line level from your acoustic bass, this is the pre amp for you. Bass and treble controls and good. The bottom boost is a bit fat and that is the only negative comment I have. Great item I would highly recommend. Check out my website: www.redpeppers.ca"
2,Disappointed,"Although I commend Panasonic for trying to put together an anniversary pack with a variety of episodes, I wasn't impressed with the episodes selected. Save for four or five selections, the rest are just throwaways. Where's ""The New Exhibit"" or some of the other underrated hour-long episodes? We'll have to wait and see, I guess. Also, I hope to see a ""Night Gallery"" compilation sometime in the near future."
1,Doesn't deserve even 1 star,"It's not necessary to discuss the series. They are classics, they are good BUT the preparation of this set is the most awful thing I've ever seen. First the DVDs are placed in a standart CD box, and the look really terrible next to other DVDs. There are no subtitles which are very necessary for foreigners like me. After seeing such a set I cannot say ""happy new 40 years"" :-((((((("
3,Good but could do better,"I have to agree with the other reviews, its great to have a collection of wonderful TLZ episodes but the packaging makes this a poor collection, stardard CD boxes, packed into a Cardboard box, hardly makes for a Good Giftpack, nor a great way to celebrate an Anniversary. Poor show Panasonic"
3,horrible packaging for a 40th Anniversary,"A flimsy box holds 3 double cd cases. No liner notes, no keep cases. A cheap way to celebrate the Anniversary."
3,Not intended for the serious collector,"If you are a serious collector -- or if you are shopping for a gift for a big fan of this show -- then you really should investigate the ""Twilight Zone Collection"" box sets.The entire series is available in a total of 5 sets. This 40th Anniversary Gift Pack is not comprehensive enough for a serious collector. It contains exactly the same material as Vol 1-5 of ""Collection 1,"" which goes beyond that, all the way to Vol 9."
1,Disappointed,"I agree with the other critics because I am collecting all of the volumes on DVD of the Twilight Zone and the gift set does not match the rest of the volumes. It stinks that there are no subtitles or language-switches and the fact that the first 15 volumes have a different start screen than do the rest of the volumes. I am getting rid of the ""gift box"" set (if you can call it that) and am just going to inverst in the real first 5 volumes."
1,Stop messing with great art,Please give us a proper CD Twilight Collection on the 40 th anniversary of this greatness. How about releasing a collection by beginning with the first episode then next the number two episode and then on.How about making use of this brilliant idea of mine and stop releasing strange collections of this nature.
3,Old classic,"Battle of the World was not the movie I thought it was, other wise a watchable if not drawn out movie.You would need to love the old classics and have and be will to watch the whole move to find out what is all about.No problem play this oh my blueray either."
1,TOO SMALL,Ordered this hat for an adult ended up giving it to a child. Way to small. Person doesn't even have a big head either and it barely fit the child.
4,Cute cowboy style hat,"I love this hat, it is stylish, and comfortable. It helped keep my face out of the sun, and looking good. The beads caught my attention, I think they add extra character to it. I got many complements while wearing this hat."
3,Caveat Emptor,"I bought this item, and it was exactly what I ordered, two sandisk cards. I bought it because It looked like a good buy, and I was in the market for a disk, but today as I was searching the item to rate it I found that I paid more for my two than any of the other offered cards cost, for one or two. I wish I had searched a little more before ordering."
2,Collection of new essays on old thoughts,"The essays printed in this collection are unfortunately not new to Atwood scholars. The essays rest in the familiar territory of genre issues, post-colonialism, canadianism, and post-modernism. It is a shame that Atwood has continued to write new and interesting prose and poetry yet her critics can find nothing new in her work."
3,Forget it,"well, this is one of the worst, or maybe it is just me, anyhow Pascal is a forgetten language."
5,Best module in the CM series,"Here's one of the best adventures ever written for D&D. Too often, the heroes are adventuring only for themselves, without any regard for the greater world at large. But here, the PCs (levels 15-20!) are relied upon by an entire Barony - and it's not just another kingdom to save, it's a Barony they're entitled to if they can prove their fealty! Thrown into the roles of avengers, saviors and rulers all at once, the adventurers rush into Twolakes Vale to find utter chaos - the land is beset by an enormous army of undead, ruled by arch-magi and an enormous dragon. Before they've proven themselves, they will have fought several massive battles with hundreds on a side, saved thousands, and undertaken more dangerous wilderness and dungeon adventures than they've ever done before! A great adventure to show jaded players just how much more challenge and fun is out there..."
5,A wonderful and easy-to-read guide for everyone,"This book gave me so much insight on the Bible and did it in an inviting, non-apprehensive way. I never thought I would enjoy it so much. The author truly appreciates the spiritual needs of those who may not be the most knowledgeable on the topic. I highly recommend it and have given three different people my copy to borrow. It's so popular, we even bought a second one to lend out!"
2,"The Slow Food Guide to New York City: Restaurants, Markets, Bars (Slow Food Guides)",My expectation was bigger. It's another City Guide with no new tips. It's need more refined information about places. It is a copy of other good guides.
5,NYC Eating Guide,This book covers the spectrum of eating at a street cart or a high-end restaurant. You'll discover gems right in your own neighborhood that you weren't aware of before and also have the chance to explore other regions of the boroughs. A must-have guidebook for food lovers who live in New York or are coming to visit.
1,A comically inept production.,"Any book that characterizes Katz's Delicatessen as a place to ""see and be seen"" is not a great source of dining wisdom, although it's good for a laugh. Clearly, this thing was put together by amateurs -- amateurs who write as if they've just arrived in New York and haven't quite figured it out yet. And they don't stay on topic very well: there are far more fast-food joints than you'd expect to find in a slow-food book. There may be a book to be written about slow food in New York. This isn't it."
4,Belfrage book,"Well written, easy read for an encyclopedic review of wineries in Nth Italy. Will take this book with me when visiting the area next year."
5,Great Product,I ordered two of these fork mounts to fabricate a custom carrier for the top of my toneau cover on my truck. They worked perfectly. The only downside is the total cost after you buy a few of these products (I also bought the front wheel holders).
3,Whats the point of the lock?,"Looks to be a great mount. Solid built. However you could still twist the acorn nut off and slide the ""axle"" through the middle and bam its off. Unlocking not necessary. I'm gonna mushroom out the end of the threads so the acorn nut cannot come off and make sure that it truly can be locked in place"
2,Delta Bike Hitch,"First, let me say, there was nothing wrong with the items that I received, theyjust were not the items I was supposed to receive. The items were not the quality Ihad ordered, and also they did not have the locks included with them.In the future, hopefully I will recieve the items advertised. I received a refund for the items, but had to take a lot of time to go through the process."
5,Ella Fitzgerald,The tape came in excellent condition. Plays like new or maybe it is new. No problems. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time. I'd purchase from this entity again.
1,Never judge a book. . .,"I REALLY wanted to like this book, but. . .I didn't. I forced myself to finish it which I haven't done with a book in a long, long time. I left it on the airplane when I was done, so apologies to the unsuspecting person who thought they happened upon a ""find."""
1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"My book club recently read this book. I can't believe a publisher would even publish this. Everyone in our book group hated the book!!! The story was boring and predictable, except for the first 7 pages which I thought was origional. The other 209 pages was just painful to read. I did not enjoy any of the characters. I have seen better erotica from a Jackie Collins novel. Save your money do not buy this book."
5,Yummy : ),"Little did I know (another innocent reader) what the pictures on the covers represented...even more than that, the first chapter was mindblowing!!! I never thought fruits and cucumbers were so tasty and beautiful.This is an erotic that won't be embarressing to be caught reading in the doctor's office or on the subway."
4,"Funny, wonderful, sexual imagination abound","give this one a chance. You will be so glad you did. Eat Me is erotic, steamy, and lap slapping funny. Perfect for a short vaction read. If it's a romantic vacation it might help in other ways. Let your imagination wander."
1,"Unsophisticated - cliche, politically correct","If you like poor character developement and favor a mindless attempt at erotica - this bud's , er book's for you. I sincerely hope women do not fantasize ""politically correct"" scenarios where they end up on top ALL THE TIME. I found this book very unrealistic, the characters cliche, and the erotica....limp."
2,unappealing anti-erotica,The sex scenes and the friendship between the women did not seem authentic. This was the most boring sexually explicit book I've ever read
3,"First book of ""this kind"" I've ever read...gimme' more...","I agree with one of the previous ""reviewers"" that the ending did seem like a bit of a cop-out. The conclusion was abrupt, but I guess I only feel that way because of the great story line that led up to it. I have to admit, when I began reading it I was a little embarrased by my purchase and suddenly remembered the expression on the book store clerk's face when I brought it to his register. But I continued to read, and didn't stop reading it that evening, until I was finished and left wanting more.Looking forward to see what she comes out with next."
2,More disjointed stories than a cohesive novel.......,"I had such high hopes for this book. I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, it didn't happen! The story of 4 Australian women has it's share of very erotic prose. The combination of food and sex results in a feast for the senses. However, those parts in between are long and often dull. I found the book to be more separate vignettes with threads that only occasionally tied each chapter together, rather than a flowing piece of fiction. Still, some of the juicier parts are worth the read....just skip the rest!"
4,Eat Me says Read This!,This is a very entertaining story about a young female writer. She is writing erotica for woman and basing most of it on her friends. This story takes you through the lives of a number of thirty something lady with very active imaginations as well as sex lives. A laugh a minute - and don't let the first chapter freak you out. I was wondering what in the hell I had bought when I read it.
2,Baloney and Processed Cheese,"Although this book is about two of my favorite things--food and sex--it was a little hard to swallow, for lack of a better term. The opening chapter is well-written and sexy, but the book falls apart soon after.The main characters are four women who eat food, have sex, and do little else worth mentioning. They're interchangable, forgettable variations on one another, and Jaivin's attempt to emphasize each one as she goes about her business inevitably chops what could be a good novel into a collection of erotic vignettes and dialogues, with a whole lot of filler in between.Is there a plot? After reading it once, I'm not sure, and in all honesty I'm not inclined to go back and find out.It's sexy at times, and it's funny at times, and Jaivin clearly has potential. But the book, neither memorable nor believable, misses its mark. Although not quite nauseating, ""Eat Me"" is unappetizing, a bit rough on the digestive system, and nutritionally void."
4,A taste of forbidden fruit!,"Eat Me isn't your typical women's erotica -- it is a novel full of intelligent dialogue and sharp wit. The novel's about four friends from Sydney -- Phillipa, Helen, Julia and Chantal -- who get together to dish out juicy details of their latest romantic exploits. The stories are rather explicit and sensuous. However, will they continue to open up about their fantasies and exquisite tales when Phillipa tells them that she's writing an erotic novel?Eat Me is like the forbidden fruit -- impossible to resist. This is one of the most original novels I have read in a long time. The vignettes within the novel are provocative and steamy. Jaivin is a wonderful writer of said genre and I look forward to reading more of her work..."
3,Does not run on Windows XP,"I spent quite a bit on this game and can't play it, as it does not work on my Windows XP. I heard that it was a great program, though I will never know. Hopefully this info. will help someone else!"
4,Great game but it has glitches,"This was one of the first games I got after I got my laptop. I like the classics, point and party options. What I don't like is the stalling and dropout that often happens whenever I try to run this game, and my laptop has the memory for it. My friend's computer also had the same problems when he tried this game.The game itself is loads of fun. The party option has a ""first to buzz in"" feature, and there are questions with visual and audio clues as well. In some cases, there's a brief explanation of the answers to entertain and educate you. I'm certain I heard Wink Martindale's voice on some of the questions. He did host the TV version of TP in the 90s. Overall a fun game, but be prepared for glitches and drop out, especially the longer the game goes. You need to have the disc in your PC to play it each time."
3,easy to digest,"I got this product to raise my ferritin levels and while i was very pleased about how I didnt have as many digestive problems with this, i am still struggling with my low levels."
5,Real Honky Tonk country,"If you like Toby Keith dont insult me by reading this review or buying this CD. Ed Burleson is the real deal. This cd is unbelievable, if you liked My Perfect World you'll like this one too, if not better. This guy is too country for Nashville, he's a Texas original. If you are in to Pat Green and the whole Texas country revolution than get this CD. You have to be a country traditionalist because this is fiddle and steel guitar and high pitched singing at its best. The first track will make you get up and two step and you wont stop until the last song. Ed will make a believer out of you that true country singer and song writers arent dead."
5,This kicks a**... deserves ten more stars at least!,"Texas honkytonker Ed Burleson is one of the brightest lights on the independent country scene today. This new record is simply flat-out one of the best hard country albums of the year... Heck, of the century (so far!). Sure, Burleson has plenty of rough edges... that's what makes his music so real. He also has a kick-ass band with guys who know how to play country music with real feeling, and a bunch of songs that sound like a real, live human being wrote 'em, not some committee in Nashville. Burleson's other albums have all been really good... this one is really great... his best to date. Highly recommended!"
5,This proves REAL country music still exists!,"This album is pure traditional country with lots of steel guitar and fiddle and has a unqiue sound to it unlike any other! Every track is dynamite, and each track has a different country style to it, most of them upbeat songs about women, drinkin', and playin good ol' honky tonk music! The best two tracks are ""All Bucked Up"" is a tribute to the great Buck Owens and the very under rated ""The Can"" a clever song about how drinking has ruined his life. This guy has an incredible voice and is pure talent and it's a wonder why he isn't more popular. I've listened to a lot of music in my day, and this is one of the best albums I have EVER HEARD!"
3,May take some getting used to,"After many years of passing up Birkenstocks for more feminine sandals, I relented and decided I wanted a pair of quality shoes for summer. My first thought? Birkenstocks. When viewing a Birkenstock shoe you can easily see the quality and know that they will last for many seasons to come. That said, quality may not always mean comfortable right out of the box (lol). My feet are flat and Birkenstocks appear to be made for those with higher arches. I am literally trying to wear them as often as I can to ""break them in"" hoping that they will get more comfortable as they get worn. They actually hurt my feet so much when I first put them on that I waited a month before trying them again. I have had other pretty decent quality shoes throughout my life and very few of them hurt after wearing them for a few minutes.Hopefully in a month or so the foot-bed will mold to the shape of my feet. If not, no more Birkenstocks for me... sadly."
3,LOVE THESE...but injured my skin,LOVE THESE but they are rough on the inside and wore a sore onto my foot for the first two weeks I wore them. By then they are too worn to return. I like the look of them though.
2,"Birkenstocks do NOT live up to the ""hype""...","These are my first Birkenstocks I own, I have bought the ""knock-off"" brand before and been halfway successful....my judgement: I'd rather spend $10 on fakes, than $40+++ on these real ones. They are NOT as comfortable as I had heard, nor are they any nicer than the fakes. Big waste of money. The only thing I liked was the silver color they came in..."
1,Problems with size,"I had problem doing the conversion on the size of the shoe.The size specified is very different from the american sizes. So, when I received my purchase, I`ve got very dissapointed, because I live in Brazil and lost my purchase.Be carefull when buying a shoe . The correct number that responses to the size 8,5 EUA is 39 EU, not 41 EU.Attention on this details."
4,"Cute shoes, but they run REALLY BIG.","These are nice shoes, good Birkey quality. But they really do run BIG. I wear a US size 6 and even the size that was supposed to fit size 5 were still too big for me. Order down!"
2,Already broken,"This item only worked for a few weeks after I got it. I don't know how old it was before I got it, so I can't speak definitively to its reliability, but after I had had it only a couple of weeks, the horizontal started to skip, and just today it gave up altogether. It must be electrical, because it doesn't move even when I turn the wheel manually. Vertical and buttons seem to work OK."
3,perhaps for that purpose..,"This is a product that looks good but is not very good for my intention about removing the dark stain on my wooden utensils or making them right as the natural color like before, but i think is kind a good mineral oil,etc."
4,Mineral oils are same,"I compared this Snow River Wood oil with other more expensive mineral oils, like John boo's.Only difference is just a thickness. John Boos oil is thicker, so it does a better job with one coat.If you apply this oil twice, there is no difference.It's very easy to apply to any wood surface. And the treated surface is very water repellent for a long time.The color of end grain gets much darker than plain grains.After trying three different mineral oils, I found that basically all mineral oils are same. So I don't need to buy these expensive ones. Just go to any drug store and buy food safe mineral oil with a fraction of cost.When mixing pure Bee wax in this oil(use heat), I could get a much better finished surface and a real good sweet smell too."
1,Waste of money,Why would anyone pay 5 times more for this than mineral oil? You can get mineral oil at any drug store and it is 100% food safe.
1,Buy it at the drug store,"This is the same food grade mineral oil they sell at any drug store to use as a laxative or personal lubricant (no explanation needed on those two lol). I can get almost half a gallon of the stuff at CVS for the same price. It's odorless, colorless, tasteless and crystal clear (no dyes) just like this stuff. I use plain old food grade mineral oil for my cutting bored, on my cutting shears for the garden, diamond honing stone ect ect... I use this stuff on any thing you would not want to use a petroleum based oil or to use it when it would come in contact with food (I.E. food grade mineral oil is ~food safe~).And no... you have to actually consume in the amounts descried on the bottle to get the laxative effect (like a table spoon or two worth, that`s not an accidental amount and all it will do is ""loosen"" you up not poison you)."
5,Great product,"Nothing to compare it with, but works great and very economical in use. I wish I knew what is the best applicator is for the wood oil though. Paper towel and any towel is not so good."
2,If I had known better ...,I would simply have bought food grade mineral oil from a local big box store at a tenth of the cost.
4,Want to keep my Cutting Board in good shape,Received on time and as advertised. I like the fact that it will keep my cutting board in solid shape and bacteria free.
4,Works well when used regularly,"I bought this product to use on our wood cutting boards and on our wood butcher block counter. This product seems to work well, but it should be applied fairly regularly (at least once each month) for best results."
3,"Poorly packaged, but otherwise good.","It's wood oil from a popular brand. You can't really go wrong with the product itself. I should have bought it at a brick and mortar store, though. It came to me and had leaked all over the box. The cap wasn't on well, but at least the bottle hadn't cracked. I decided to keep it because there was still quite a bit left, but it was slippery and messy and wasteful, so I docked it some stars. The bottle is part of the product and should be able to make it to me fully intact."
3,* * * 3 1/2 stars * * *,"This language learning learning set is extremely thorough. However, there is a bit too much stress placed on the conjugation of verbs too early in the coursework. While important to understand verb conjugations in Italian, they should be taught a bit later in the course, with more emphasis should be placed on conversational skill. However, this is not a problem if you have a lot of time to master Italian.Additionally I noticed the phrase ""week-end"" was translated into Italian as ""week-end"". Check your Italian dictionary! While there are some peculiarities, all in all this is a good course. The native speakers present an almost melodic conversational style which is very enjoyable. Certainly, for the money, it is a good value and a very good aid in the acquisition of the language."
1,Not worth the money,"I read the book inserts, and the reviews and bought this book expecting more than it delivered. The only time they speak English is to repeat what they just said (too quickly)in Italian. If you want to memorize phrases, without really learning the language then this is the program for you. If you really want to learn Italian try another program."
3,A fair book with some errors.,"Overall this is not a bad book for learning Italian. However, after learning a bit of Italian and looking back at it there are quite a few mistakes. Misspellings, grammar errors and maybe even more annoying; the ""cultural notes"" are antiquated and more often than not will give you a wrong image of Italy and Italians. By the way I have the second edition so you would think that it should be rid of most mistakes."
2,Toto - - So So,"I have 3 of these in my home and although the mention of the name ""Toto"" is usually followed up by contractors and plumbers with ""these are great toilets,"" I am not a satisfied user. We have had to have the toilets snaked so often we finally broke down and learned how to do it ourselves. Not enough oomph in the flush to move it all through the pipes. We now have a 3-flush rule for bowel movements: (1) mid-poop flush; (2) end of poop flush and (3) post toilet paper wiping flush. This totally cancels out the low-gallon-per-flush feature. Instead of 1/6 gpf, it becomes 3 x 1/6 gallons per flush.In addition, in the past 11 years since they were installed, we have had to replace all the flappers between 1 and 2 times each, the handle mechanism in two of them, and the filling parts in all three.I cannot recommend them."
5,"great toilet, small profile","This toilet is a great performer, it is perfect for small bathrooms but performs just as good as any larger one. We love how fast it refills. And the flush is very efficient."
5,Chicago When They Were In Their Prime. A Must-Have!,"Chicago's fifth album is in my opinion their best. It is everything that the term ""Jazz-Rock"" applies to. The musicianship and production are first-rate (especially since they recorded this album relatively quickly). The hit is obviously ""Saturday In The Park"", which is a great song. But, the highlight is when Cetera and Kath trade vocals in the obscure ""Now That You're Gone"". Kath's soulful voice in the verses is enhanced/countered by Cetera's pure melodic choruses. The rhythm track is Chicago in its prime. Seraphine is on fire and the horn break is one of their best. ""Dialogue"" is another song which contrasts Cetera and Kath's vocal abilities. There is no fluff on this release. It's a record of one of the most musically adept groups in their absolute prime."
4,The middle size! These work much better then the large size.,"The line of Raichlen skewers are all very well built using all stainless steel and somehow the handles stay reasonably cool when you are using them on the grill. This size is the middle of the line in terms of width. I think these are much better then the larger size which is too big and the smaller size which might be a touch too small.(I saw other reviews complaining that these were too wide and another claiming that they didn't cook meat from the inside...my responses, cut your stuff to fit the skewer and I'm also not sure what someone is looking for in a skewer that would cook things from the inside too, that sounds like a recipe for some well-done meat...ick)"
3,Disappointing...,"I was tired of using skewers that causing meat to spin around when I tried to turn them, so I gave these a try.Good:- They are definitely preventing the spinning meat problem.- They have the perfect length, not too short not too long.- Shape of the handle allows easy control of the skewer.Bad:- They are way too wide and if the meat chunks are not cut pretty big they get ripped into pieces when you try to insert the skewer.- Shape of the handle causes uneven placement of the skewer on the grill surface as one side sits flat but the other side will sit with an angle due to the handle shape (not such a big deal)- Sharp end could be cut on both sides. It takes some effort to go through the meat due the the thickness of the skewer.Ugly:- When I took them out the second time to use I notices rust marks! May be not such a great quality of stainless steel ..."
4,Just what I wanted,"These work great. They slide much more easily through whatever I'm skewering since I sharpened them. If you do that to yours, just be careful with them. :-)I added a picture if you were interested in seeing how they look now.4 stars since I had to sharpen them, otherwise, they are perfect!"
4,works ok for me,Check the length of these before buying. They will not fit in smaller grills. Clean up is a little hard.
2,another 'me too' product,"In my opinion, the best tasting barbecue is where the meat is cooked from the inside and the outside in about the same time. Otherwise, the outside dries out while the inside is still uncooked.To achieve this, you need to use- metal skewers- medium to high heat- have sufficient mass in the skewer to absorb heat and conduct it to cook the inside of the meatThe skewers should not be round because the meat will just spin when the skewers is turned on the BBQ.I thought the Steven Raichlen Best of Barbecue SR8026 Signature Stainless Steel Skewers would do the trick since they were wide. Unfortunately, they are not thick enough to conduct sufficient heat to the center of the meat to cook it from the inside.They join my discarded skewer pile. The search continues for the ideal skewer....."
3,Not perfect.,"I purchased these skewers b/c I grill lots of vegetables and was tired of veggies spinning on round skewers and falling apart. The flat design of these skewers is a good thing. Food doesn't slip or spin. However, these skewers are extremely wide. So wide, in fact, that one must carefully cut veggies to ensure they aren't too narrow for the skewer. In fact, the shear girth of these skewers often tears smaller veggies apart. Can't say I'd buy these again."
1,Problems make it impossible to play,"I stumbled upon this game after buying ""Scrabble"" by the same company. After reading the reviews posted, I thought it'd be a great game to play. Unfortunately, I really can't answer that question as I never manage to even get started playing the game; the game will just shut down on me just as a round begins to start. This happens repeatedly and in various degrees at startup. I don't know if it is my computer as I've done everything I can to remedy the situation -- without success, but there's obviously some kind of glitch in the game and I think people need to be aware of that before they buy it. It may be among the best games out there, but for some of us, that will make no difference if you can't play it."
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun!","If you like the board game - you're gonna love this Cd-Rom version.Once you've played, you'll be hooked - just like me! Great host, marvelous graphics, and challenging questions make this a joy to have. It's the family version of ""You Don't Know Jack""!Buy it now! Then tell all of your friends! This game rocks!"
5,Last Section doesn't work,We have had problems with the last section onthe Scattergories that we bought not workingIt just quits responding. We love the game buthate to miss the total. Any ideas?
2,The sickness outweighs the humor.,"I understand that this bumpersticker is intended as a humorous rebuttal to the annoying ""Baby on Board"" signs. However, this bumpersticker conjures up a horrific image of child abuse. There are plenty of horrific news stories of child abuse and neglect, without having to conjure up heartbreaking imagery. As I write this, I remember the heartbroken bereaved father sobbing his eyes out on the Oprah show because he accidently left his infant in a car seat on a hot day. How would he feel if he were behind a car sporting this sticker? I gave this sticker a 2nd star to acknowledge the humor, sick though it is. But I would hope people would pass on purchasing this sticker."
4,"A Prince Consort, who really should have been king.","At a time when marriages of royals were political matches, and not romantic ones, this is a story of an insignificant German prince who is married to the very young, Queen of England. Victoria and Albert actually fall in love with each other. Unfortunately, physicians at the time did not know when human females ovulated, which resulted in the many children of Victoria and Albert. However, her numerous pregnancies allowed Albert to become a more integral part in the monarchy. He became King in all but name as Victoria retired to the ""sidelines."" His diligent, untiring work set the stage for the great Victorian Era and the Pax Britannia."
4,I need to stick up for this game here...,"I don't get it. Nowhere on the packaging for this game does it say its the original arcade version of Centipede, so how is that something to complain about...?Having said that, I once had a demo version of this, and played it for hours. Unfortunatly, the disc wouldn't load into my newer PC, and I thought it was off to the same black hole as After Dark, Jill of the Jungle, Lemmings, etc.Recently I found the CD ROM for this, case intact, at a thrift store. I'm so glad I did, too. Its a fun shoot-em-up game, with multiple levels and worlds to make your way through. I'm not a 'gamer'; I play games online for short periods of time and then get bored. But, this one is a different story. Well recommended."
5,Saved us and our litter,"We had an orphaned litter of six puppies. Their mom died just two days after they were born. Luckily they got colostrum from her so we didn't have to worry about that. Some other breeders offered to take our pups and try and let them nurse on lactating girls they owned. We just didn't want to give them up. Losing their mom, who was only 4 years old, was a blow. The pups were all we had left of her, so we tube fed them, and when they got bigger, stronger and better at suckling, we bottle fed them. We've successfully weaned them off of the formula which seemed to give them everything they needed to flourish. They grew and matured at the same rate as pups from other litters we've had in the past. So, I would recommend this product without hesitation. It worked for us in the most dire of situations, and our puppies have matured beautifully."
4,Everything you would expect for less than $100,"First reviewer obviously is looking for something for nothing. For less than $100, it takes reasobly good distance photo's of sports and wildlife. have had it a short time and have already taken better photo's of the deer in my woods than I ever did with my much more expensive digital camera. light enough and yes, inexpensive enough, to tuck in my coat for going fishing or hunting. If you are a professional wildlife photographer this is not the camera for you. This is the camera for the rest of us."
4,Fun for My 6-Year-Old Son,"My 6-year-old son wanted a ""spell book"" that had room for him to write down his spells. He doesn't know how to ""spell"" yet, so the writing part will come eventually. He likes the size and format of the book, and the price was great."
2,.,"I'm pretty fondly disposed to Bataille, but Blue of Noon was a disappointment. The title and the cover are wonderful, and having read Story of the Eye and L'abbe C just before it, I expected great things. But what I received instead was a drawling, shabby, painfully tedious and remarkably unmemorable narrative ramble. It isn't as disturbing as Story of the Eye, and it isn't as interesting as L'abbe C, and it feels much shorter in the surreal atmospheric magic that made those two books worthwhile. If you've already read and enjoyed Bataille, you may want to check Blue of Noon out, but it is not one of his better works."
3,Thin sound,"I expected better from Chandos, the music is not up to their normal standards of fidelity."
5,Perfect,I was looking for a nice bow/arrow for my son without breaking the bank and without being too childish. This item fitted the bill perfectly. It it easy for my 10 yr old to handle and he enjoys it.
4,Great Bow for beginners...description of included items not quite accurate.,"Bought this as a beginning bow for my 7-year-old daughter who has gained a recent interest in archery. I received the bow today. The bow and included arrows look great. It seems sturdy in construction. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star is that the Amazon description says that a multi-color target is included. Ours did not have one, nor the the packaging seem to have any way to include one. The target is really just a piece of paper, but I will now have to buy one separate and still get it here in time for her birthday. The description should be updated. -Fred Gerwig"
2,not what I expected,"I bought this for my son thinking it would be a good bow to start with until he was strong enough for a bigger one. Unfortunately, it didn't shoot arrows so much as fling them forwards, even when I handled it. My son quickly because frustrated and lost interest in it."
2,Too big and heavy for a kid,"I purchased this thinking my son would be able to use this considering this is a ""Junior"" bow. I would call it a ""teenager"" bow because there is no way a kid can use this. It's way too big and it's too hard to pull back. I shipped back. Huge disappointment! Purchased a different bow from another place that is smaller and less weight to pull back and is actually a kid bow. I would only recommend this if your child was a young teen or teenager. It would be great for that."
5,Excellent product,This product was selected by my 8 year old. It is excellent but a little hard for a little guy.
1,hmm... it was the R.M.S. Titanic .,"To speak for the accuracy of this title, The ship was named the R.M.S. TITANIC, not the U.S.S.."
1,"Oh, Please","If pretentious language, mock-profundity, heavy-handedness, and stereotypes are what you like, then this is the book for you. PEEL MY LOVE LIKE AN ONION is nothing more than a gussied-up Harlequin Romance hiding behind the good name of literature. Don't be fooled by this one."
1,major disappointment,"While the story zipped along, the uneven and garbled writing derailed my interest. The plot was also just too contrived. I'm not sure why Castillo is considered literary fiction. In truth, this novel fits into the aisle of schlocky commercial fiction."
1,One Star is Generous,"I had wanted to like this book -- I did -- but I must confess that I agree with many of the one-star reviews here. If this book hadn't been marketed as ""literary,"" I wouldn't have minded -- namely, because I wouldn't have bought it -- but it's a disservice to other Latina writers, such as Cisneros, to place this book in the same category. My review is for those who have read and enjoyed work by Cisneros, Alvarez, Chavez, Nunez, and others. Don't be fooled by this one. Cisneros is to Castillo as Bellow is to Robert James Waller."
1,Cultural Trash,A book for the NY effete cocktail party circuit of liberal arts beer bingers & PC police. Amazon's advertising copy typists and technicians would market this sickly fodder as literature.
1,PEEL MY BOOK LIKE AN EDITOR SHOULD HAVE,As bad as anything i have read; a disjointed fantasy with nothing special to offer. I felt cheated.
1,Outdated and High Brow...Not for the Non-Academics or Those New to Outsourcing,"If you're not either very experienced in outsourcing already or a college level instructor in outsourcing, I would not recommend this book.Since it was written, a couple more creative and straight shooting books on ""how to outsource"" are available, particularly in 2005. I advise you to search and find those books independently as I found them much more enlightening, current and relevant to providing directions on outsourcing's nuts and bolts to true strategic and transformational outsourcing elsewhere. Outsourcing has evolved along way since this book was written. It needs updating or should simply be viewed as a reference book after you've read the recent selections by other authors to be on top of your game."
3,A Great Framework but no Systems Integration,"Given the great reviews from other readers, you aren't wasting your money to follow Greaver's framework and advice in outsourcing. However, I was very disappointed that he omitted systems integration. Where is EDI, e-Procurement, auctions, ASP's in the outsourcing initiative? For a book written in 1999, one would expect these to be included (ala supply chain management). If you are going to outsource, do you want a manual system of operation in your procurement in this new economy? Get real! Maurice, it's time for a second edition."
5,Nice....,"This series is awesome. the only downfall I have about this DVD is the English dubs are terrible except maybe Rena's from time to time. But the DVD does come with the Jap. and English subs, so it's not that bad. I can't wait for the rest of the season to come out on DVD."
5,A true challenge for the Intelectual Mind,This anime is a wonderful challenge for the intelecctually gifted. I thorughly enjoyed every episode and would reccomend it to any anime fan.
3,Smarttip application,"Kensington universal adapters are great. The convenience of having tips for cell phones and PDAs togheter with laptop charger, in the same package is outstanding. However be careful with your selection of smarttips: I bought this one in the understanding it works for my Palm TX, but it does not, neither for the Palm Zire 72 I also have. If you need one for Palm TX I believe it is the Kensington Smarttip Pack 24508 Handspring Treo the one could work with the TX also, but I have not tested it yet. I am planning to buy one to try it with my PDA. Also for cameras there is no a wide selection of tips, but still the system is a great idea."
1,book: absolute trash,"for people who really want to go to law school,... you REALLY don't want to waste your TIME and MONEY with this book. i need help on the logic reasoning section. i was hoping to get better explanations for each question. the book has absolutely NO proper format. i was spinning my wheels with this book. ABSOLUTELY NOT NECESSARY. i believe they are an opportunist taking advantage of sincere people who really want to go to law school. if you're hoping to get at least a 150 on your lsat get the princeton review (at least they format each section properly and give better explanations). if you want to get >160 get the 10 real lsat book."
1,Doesn't Work with Windows Me,"I expected to play Scrabble on the Scrabble, but instead I had to brush my browser arrow all over the screen, like a window cleaner, to get it to change. Then when I finally did get the scrabble board, part of it was hidden off the top of the screen. Hasbro advised that my Dell Celeron 3800 was sufficient for the job, but maybe the Windows Me doesn't quite fit Scrabble 2. I regretfully had to send it back. So if you have Windows Me, be prepared to be disappointed."
1,Bad Customer Support,"I received my new Scrabble at Christmas and I've not used it yet. When I hit play, my screen goes black and an error message comes up. (I have a new computer.) I've e-mailed many times and tried calling (the phone number included with the instructions is not valid) but I've not received any support. However, they did send a response when I registered on-line - go figure."
5,scrabble for the computer,This game is addictive. I have one and bought another for a friend and she loves it as well. I couldn't believe how fast it arrived after ordering it. The price was great as well.
4,Robin not included :),"I kind of though Robin Hood would be included, but he is not. As it turns out I also purchased kneeling Robin Hood and he can sit on the horse as well as the one pictured, if not as accurately positioned. Nice quality figures for the price. Thanks!"
5,Classic songs for dances of the 1920s.,"In addition to the opening Ragtime Intermezzio, this compilation contains classics designed for dancing Foxtrot, Tango, Novelty Foxtrot, Cake Walk, Waltz & the Two Step.Excellent!"
4,The Springs take up space.,"The unit is built to hold a set of springs that create the ""spring reverb"" that you are enjoying. It's not just for the kick pad. Any spring reverb unit will make that sound when dropped or kicked or rattled. The springs have to be a certain length to create the distinctive sound of the unit. Most spring reverb units use springs that are a foot long, or even twice that so in comparison the unit is actually pretty compact."
3,Nice Reverb,"First off, why did it have to come with such a large footprint when all the other Danelectro gizmos are one third the size? I imagine it probably has to do with the Spring Effect kick-board which for a blues harp player is as useful as a french horn at a jamaican festival. But once you plug it in, it can give you a nice reverb effect should you not have any of the other Danelectro products. Having said that, I took a star away because the tone adjustment is a bit on the tender side and a discriminating ear really can't hear the subtleness of it."
1,A big waste of time,"Maybe I've become less patient as I've gotten older, but Carolyn Sullivan is such a silly/stupid character that I found myself not really caring if she fell prey to the bad guy. When I started reading this book I thought the premise was good....but this woman is supposed to be intelligent and a good mother??? Really? Job always comes before her kids....she falls head over heels for a guy she meets in an auto accident and goes out with ONE time! When she says, ""will you take care of me forever?"" I thought I would gag. The dialog is pathetic.... When she's surprised in her home by the rapist/killer, and being held at gunpoint, the daughter suddenly dares him to shoot her? Oh sure... that's just what every teenage girl would say. I like my fiction to have some relation to reality and this was just too ridiculous to hold my interest. A parole officer who investigates crimes, gathers evidence AND confronts killers. Come on! Want a good read? Buy a Sue Grafton novel."
1,"Stupid, stupid book.","This book sucked. I made myself read the whole thing, just to prove it deserved my scorn from beginning to end. I read it really fast because I couldn't wait for the torture to be over, instead of savoring it like a really good read. I wish I could give it minus-stars or the opposite of stars. Really, don't waste your time. This was my first NTR book and will be my last."

1,NEVER RECEIVED THIS DVD,I PAID FOR THIS DVD AND NEVER RECEIVED IT. AND I TRY TO GET IN TOUCHWITH YOU FOLKS NO LUCK
2,This Sucks,"This is the worst PPV ever, only 7 matches what a load of crap!1. Chavo vs. ReyWinner: Rey (Rey's title Raign was so over rated)2.Big Show vs. Sabu (ECW Title)Winner: Big Show (Retain) (Half Way Desent, Couple Table)3.Hulk Hogan vs. Randy OrtonWinner:Hulk Hogan (Only Good Match)4.Ric Flair vs. Mick Foley (I Quit)Winner: Flair (About as good as Show vs. Sabu)5.Batista vs. King Booker T W/Sharmell (World Title)Winner: Batista (DQ) (Sharmell Screwed it Up)6.D-X vs. The McMahonsWinners: D-X (Both Teams Overrated, All the crapy Wrestlers That weren't on good enough to get on the card, And of course the Big Show Showed up to beat the crap out of D-X)7.Edge w/ Lita vs. John Cena (WWE Title)Winner: Edge w/Lita (Retain) (The overrated Superstar Prevailed Again)Grand Total: 2/5 StarsI Suggest you do what Half (The Smart Half) of the Wrestling Fans did and switch to TNA, And instead of buying this buy Slammiversary 2006 (5/5 Stars), Alot better."
3,Only 2 Matches Worth Watching,"This year Summerslam I gotta say is not the best. I think lat years was better. Contains more and better matches.There's only 2 matches that are worth watching I think is Hulk Hogan vs Randy Orton & DX vs The McMahons. Those twoare the only match that are worth watching. But the sad thing that they made the Hogan/Orton match the third matchof the night. I expect to be the Main Event instead it's Cena vs Edge for the WWE Championship. By the way this matchis not that bad. Is way better than the World Title Match. They should also add The Undertaker vs The Great Khali,instead of being scheduled on Smackdown, two days before Summerslam. By the way it's worth of buying this video foryour now and then wrestling collection."
1,What a crock o' crapola!,"This is the old bait and switch: the book pretends to be about the homosexual lifestyle, but in fact it is nothing more than a white paper for the right-wing political agenda. Getting over being gay is about as easy as, say, getting over having blue eyes. The storyline (self-loathing schmuck finds a twisted kind of redemption via hypocrisy) might as well have been written by the Heritage Foundation. If someone straight (as am I) finds this book so blatantly offensive and political, imagine how gays in search of information re sexual identity would feel after plunking down hard-earned money for propaganda that is aimed at pepetuating hatred toward them. People who spew this kind of trash are so busy hating gays they forget to love humanity."
1,Nothing worth reading,"Any book that, instead of supporting equal rights and acceptance for all, suggests that homosexuality (which exists in many animal species and is in fact a normal minority) is wrong sends the incorrect message. Legalize gay marriage and lift the stigma from homosexuality and no one gets hurt!"
1,Ridiculous,"Any book that denounces a whole group of people like this is absurdist at best, bigoted and hateful at worst. Instead of reading this, may I suggest that you attend a PFLAG meeting, or read any number of other books that will allow you to actually understand the gay movement and it's people rather than using hyperbole, blantant untruths and fear to motivate people to hate a group that does you no harm."
2,Makes a point,"The point of this book is that the inexorable grip of homosexual lust leads inevitably to the betrayal of wife and family, and ultimately the tragedy of lives cut short. Although this plot appears to be taken from films like Fatal Attraction (minus the homosexual bit of course), it does serve to remind all of us that family betrayal is usually a bad thing. It's good that there are still books out there with such a wholesome, moral message. My only query is, why couldn't the author have left out all the unwholesome references to homosexuality?"
5,"GUIRNALDA SEBASTIAN, AMORATADA POR LA VIDA","ESTA ES LA HISTORIA DE UNA MUJER QUE DESCIENDE A LO MAS PROFUNDO DE NUESTRA SOCIEDAD Y AVECES NOS PREGUNTAMOS SI PODRA VOLVER A LEVANTARSE. ES LA HISTORIA DE UNA VOLUNTAD INDOMITA, Y AVECES ES BRUTAL Y DULCE AMARGA, COMO LA VIDA SUELE SER. SÉ QUE LE VA A ROBAR EL CORAZON. ASEGURESE QUE TIENE PAÑUELOS, ANTES DE EMPEZAR A LEERLO."
3,Unexpected Load Bar,"I ordered a 100-pack of these, but they weren't what I was expecting. Amazon's page didn't state that they included a load bar. I double-checked and the load bar does show in the picture, but I failed to notice it. If you want RJ45 plugs without load bars, check out this type:C2G / Cables to Go 11380 RJ45 Cat5 8 x 8 Modular Plug for Round Stranded Cable - 50pk"
3,"boring as can be, but useful for BSD internals","this book is about as boring as they come. a collection of section 8 manpages (the admin's section) and the papers describing the release of 4.4BSD (and installation on several architectures no longer popular), this book is nothing but reference. however, it's an invaluable reference for hard core old school BSD types and deep system hackers. sometimes you have to go back to the original source, ie for 4.4BSD's filesystem design or old perl 5.an average BSD (Net, Open, Free) user/admin wont get anything out of it. and that's fine. the book is old (1994) and dated, but still contains invaluable reference material. recommended only for the hard core BSD hacker."
5,A Comfortable Concealment Solution,"Although a bit to wide, the product is very comfortable to wear for hours, does not show through clothing, and never ""set off"" alarms in the 4 airports I traveled through. I think a narrower, two pocket variety (just slightly larger than passport dimensions) would be better but this one does all it is intended to do and appears sturdy with smmothly operating zippers."
4,"Worked well, but could be improved",I purchased this to take to Italy for vacation and used it almost every day. The only issue I had was that the lower corners could have been rounded a bit more to make the fit more comfortable when using this inside the front of pants. The corners tended to roll up a little. The item is very well make and the leather worked better than I originally thought. Would recommend to others needing a secure way to protect important documents or money in areas that have known issues with pick pockets.
3,Too wide,"It's a nice belt, but it's way too wide. If I try to make it as tight as posible it still doesn't fit me. I'm not skinny but not chubby either, just a flat stomach. Otherwise no complaints, not recomended for thin people."
1,Baby steps to intolerance,"In an era where our teachers and ministers alike are striving ever harder to imbue our children with a sense of the beauty of cultural diversity and concord among the peoples of the world, Johnson and Zacharias' contribution to children's literature is shameful and backward. According to Johnson and Zacharias, being a good Christian means affirming that ""our"" God is not ""their"" God, that modern science is dubious, and that a layman's survey of the bible is sufficient preparation for spiritual independence. Ignoring modern critical scholarship of the bible (but emphasizing inconsistencies in non-Christian texts), the children's version of Jesus Among Other Gods teaches that religious exploration is for clever people like Zacharias but not for those who really want to reflect on the nature of God, salvation and religious observance. That this book should be on any child's bookshelf is a tragedy."
5,The best!!!,"When my husband was stationed in Germany, I got used to this coffee. I think it tastes like a regular blend. My husband likes Starbucks, and when I serve him this coffee he has to ask if it is decaf. Like the other reviewer, I think this coffee is a little pricey, but definitely worth it!"
5,The only one to buy,"There are lots of bra pads out their for us nursing moms, but these are the only ones that are completely hidden under your clothes. Many of the other brands are noticeable either by the crease or by the edging. These are 100% unnoticeable!"
3,Soft Silicone,"Used this mask on a recent snorkel/ scuba trip to thailand. The silicone sure is of a high quality and the view is uninterrupted. Fogs easily though, didn't have an anti-fog spray but i didn't expect to need one with a 50$ mask"
5,great cd,"such a good cd! i love zox, i'm also from their home town, but they are just so great!Take Me Home"
4,Need to choose a style?,"The complete martial arts is a style by style review of different martial art disciplines. It includes 25 different types of martial arts and gives brief history of how it came about and its origin, gives examples by using illustrations, and answers many questions that would be asked when choosing a style for yourself. A very enjoyable read with a good balance of text and illustration to maintain high interest throughout."
2,A very basic overview of Hiring and Retaining,"Not helpful for someone who knows a lot about hiring, recruiting, and retaining. It has nice concepts, but most would be difficult to apply without completely changing the organizational culture. There are a few nice tables and diagrams, and the paper is nice, but that hardly adds up to its being a great buy."
3,want money? read it,"business is not an easy philosophy. without conscience this book pulls you into the western world developed by money. {technology, power, advancement} vs. {values, ethics, brotherly love} this has been such a challenge to me living in various countries. am I majoring computer science and international studies because of plainly money? is that all I can be? computer is merely an application, not a culture itself. this book talks too much on solving in a western point of view which is a vice to the future economy of America. To survive at least for the next 10 years, people have to start thinking and encouraging others of facing world wide issues related to different cultures around the world. This is a GREAT BOOK! Yet, the reader should acknowledge the limit the author is drawing your attention to."
1,Realistic???,I found the book sadly filled with useless pages filled with photos of people (8 pages) and even more of nothing most people would ever think of carving(12 pages) that's 20 out of 63 pages wasted. Carving REALISTIC Faces.... is anything but. I find all of the carvings to be more alien than realistic. Does offer little help in the layout of a head and facial features.If your good enough to attempt carving a face you are way beyond this book.
3,Mothers & Daughters,"[...] Not one to judge a book merely by it's cover, I picked it up, and was thrust into the lives of three women: Anna (a American women who marries an Italian prince), Constanza (their offspring), and Flavia (Constanza's daughter). Since the book was written in the 50's, I had trouble understanding some parts of it. (Hey! I'm an '80s child!) The book also all took place before the end of 1929. However, despite a few areas where I was confused, I found the book to be descriptive, sometimes a bit much in some areas (leading off into tangents that made no sense), but for the most part the details added to the reader's enjoyment in taking in the ""Old World"" of Italy, France, and England. The relationships between mothers and daughters are explored in great detail, and so are their often odd relationships with men. We can actually see a little of each woman in her mother. The ending was a bit unsatisfying, but overall, not a bad read."
3,Please Help!,"My Skookie kit came with the Blue Cattle Truck Co Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix, but no recipe for how to make the mix!!! I was planning to make it tonight for a special occasion... If you remember what goes in the mix, please help me!! I appreciate any info you can provide. I may have to search my pantry for other cookie mixes as I don't have all the ingredients on hand to make from scratch..."
4,"The brownie mix was not great, however...","These are robust little skillets, and can certainly be used for a lot more than just brownies. I also was impressed by the recipe book it came with. But the brownie mix was not great, and was a ""sample"" size, not a full mix. The little ""holders"" are not what is pictured; They're so small and flimsy I threw them away."
1,What you see is NOT what you get.,"This is definitely a case of what you see is NOT what you get. Yes, you get two cast iron pans, yes, you get a bag of cookie dough, and yes, you get covers, but they are nothing like what is pictured. First, the skillets are much smaller than what I was expecting. The descriptions says 7 inches by 10 and a half inches by one inch. In reality, the internal dimensions are 6 and a half inches by about three quarter inches deep. The ""Form Fitting Hot Pad"" is nothing more than a tiny wrap that goes around the handle (picture a finger cut off of a glove oven mitt). It does NOT cover the bottom of the skillet. The cookie dough is NOT Lehi Roller Mills in a nice bag, it is a generic mix in a small plastic bag with instructions stuck on the outside. It actually has printed on the label ""Prepared especially for Skookie by the nice ladies at Blue Cattle Truck Trading Co.""Very disappointed in what I would consider false advertising. Buyer beware."
4,Pan=good/ directions=poor,I have no complaints about the pans or the recipe book. I just didn't like how they give us a bag of cookie mix then don't say how to prepare it. Its a waste of cookie mix. There's nowhere on the internet that says what it needs either. Just put the directions for the cookie mix on the box and then I have no complaints.
1,DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Cheap and tacky, this product is NOT what it claimed to be! It most certainly does NOT come with a Lehi Roller brand brownie mix; instead it comes with a little plastic bag of cheap, generic brownie mix. The so-called ""hot pads"" are actually teeny, tiny cheap fleece handle covers that are as big as my middle finger! I feel ripped off and do NOT recommend this to anyone, unless you are looking to give a gag gift that you don't mind being embarrassed over! This cheap joke of a gift is going back!"
5,The Captive of Kensington Palace by Jean Plaidy,A novel about the sentimental and sheltered princess who blossomed into the most famous queen of all time ...Description from the book back cover:She was haunted by a crown and scepter. Young Princess Victoria was never allowed to be alone. She was always protected from political intrigue and royal scandal - a virtual prisoner of her ambitious mother and her scheming lover. It didn't take long for Victoria to become aware of the sinister conflicts surrounding her. There were those who were obsessed with usurping her future power by either violence or marriage. And there were those who were determined she would never take the throne. But no one could deny the glorious destiny that awaited her ...
3,is there operating system sun os9 ?,is there operating system sun solaris 9 with this book?mean for evalution purpose for certain month
5,Vast improvement,"I bought the Solaris 8 version of this book. It was OK but did not contain sufficient material on the new technologies. I ordered the Solaris 9 version of the book because it's the only Solaris 9 book around. I am happy to report that this book covers new technologies like RBAC, LDAP and the resource manager. These are so much more important for the enterprise than GNOME. Strong emphasis on disks - format, partition, volume management, backups - is good and logically ordered. The only thing I would like to see is more coverage on application servers, databases, message queues and other uses of Solaris in large firms. But that's probably an architecture book with a different focus."
4,Different contents!!,"I'm not sure what books the other reviewer has been looking at, but there are a lot of differences between the certification book and the reference book. There is some overlap between the two because some of the topics are the same for the exam and for everyday use. But the reference book contains lots of reference infos but the certification book contains exams, reviews, test questions etc. I have both books and I use them differently. Keep up the great work Dr. Watters!"
4,The Complete reference Solaris 9,I would say that this book is really good if you had your hands dirty with Solaris 8. Gives you detailed knowledge about Solaris Administration. Have fun ! CheersManish Gaur
1,No stars- Definitely not complete,"I bought this book to learn about Solaris 9, not Solaris 7. Another example of a book that was too quick to ship. How can a book be published in April 3 when the OS is released in late June? Here are the reasons I returned mine and suggest to the publisher (author) that they go back to the drawing board and do their homework:Incomplete coverage of the Solaris Management Console- instead it covers the (soon to be) obsolete Admintool for setting up users, printers, loading software. Sun says to start migrating from Admintool in their Solaris 9 release notes. Nothing on soft partioning, and worse yet, no covereage of how to use Solaris Volume Manager. Nothing on Projects when setting up user accounts. Nothing on the SMC process tool. Nothing on how to use SMC to manage disks and file systems. Nothing on Print Manager. One page on Jumpstart- should be a whole chapter. I'm running out of space but, you get the point."
1,same contents,The contents of this book is basically the same as 'Sun Certified Solaris 9.0 System and Network Administrator' (All-in-One) from the same author. Buy only 1 of either.
4,Cool Videos from the King of Lyrics,"nobody writes Lyrics like Smokey Robinson. the Brother is a Poets Poet.He has always had a cool way with expressing himself.the videos here are cool.""Ebony Eyes"" with Him&the Late great Rick James is a Classic.Smokey's vocals are timeless.He is One of the Greatest Artists Ever."
2,Not the book I was looking for,When I bought the book I was hoping that it would contain some useful information for me as a first time owner of a Harley-Davidson Sportster. I guess I should have done my homework better because this book did not contain anything useful for me apart from some nice pictures of Sportster models thru the years. So it is a nice coffee table book for people to browse through. I guess I should buy the service manual instead so that I can get some useful info if I want to get my hands dirty working on the Sportster :-)
4,Worth Buying,"Excellent work by Mr. Bivin. He takes you back to the life setting of first century Judea, and this is truly the way to more properly understand the words of the Messiah. What was so natural to people living then is lost to us simply because of our modern culture. You will not be disappointed in this work. Whether you are in complete agreements with all or not your knowledge of these matters will increase."
4,looking for a magical girl romance novel?,"Then this manga is for you. This volume is mostly an introduction, but it looks like it may have a fairly interesting mythology once it gets going. The heroine is fairly passive in this volume, but that may be due to the rather rude shocks she recieves early in the story. If you're offended by naughty scenes or sexual coercion fantasies, you'll want to skip this one."
5,A fabulous book for anyone considering starting a sewing business!,"As a custom dressmaker for overe twelve years, and a mentor to many who are just starting out, I highly recommend this book for all of the details a person who might be thinking about a sewing business might nothave considered. After reading this one, I would recommend reading other business books that cover business principles for ANY type of business. Creative, custom businesses come with their own unique challenges, and she covers these issues well. The only information I think should be updated for today's markeplace is the advertising advice, and, since sewing is really a local pursuit, a bit more regional/demographic information would be useful."
2,Not as helpful as I hoped...,"I had hoped that this book would contain more detailed information about how to successfully start and grow a boutique-style sewing business. Sadly, the things it contained I considered to be simple, common sense, and I didn't find it useful at all. You might do better with a highly recommended book about home-based business, or a guide to being successfully self-employed. The sewing aspect of the business is almost the least important... if you're proficient enough to take on clients or open a shoppe, chances are you're already a good sewer! Better bulk up on accounting, tax prep, insurance requirements, and ways to protect yourself and your business against problem customers."
5,Aaliyah...As an inspiration...!,"I love everything about Aaliyah, cause she was trully an entreteiner, a sweet little girl that will always be in our hearts..!She was not only beautiful, but a great person with a lot of dreams, some of them came true, but not all...Iam sure that she is watching us right now, and that she would love to see us smile whenever we think about her...i loved this book, its treasure for me that i will always carry and another way to know that iam alive, and to fight for my dreams because we never know when is our time to go..!"
5,aaliyah was one in amillion,hello my name is jalisa cullwell and i just want to saythat i miss aaliyah very much and that i will miss her voiceon the t.v and the radio.she was a very big asperiance to me and every body else.I just want to say i will miss her very much.GOD WAS MISSING AN ANGEL.
5,Very Informative,"I've gotten all the Cavala books and DVDs I could and they complement each other very well. This one tells a lot more about the making of Cavalia, the people and horses behind the show, and has a lot of beautiful photos. I enjoyed it very much."
5,Very Good,If you want to know then just the mother's side of things this is the book. It is an easy read and lots of information for the mom who wants to breastfeed to the person who just wants to know more about breastfeeding/breastmilk
5,I wish I'd had this BEFORE MY SON WAS BORN!,"I thought I'd done everything I could to prepare for breastfeeding, but if a friend hadn't brought me this book at 3 weeks I really might have thrown in the towel. I was starting to think I'd never make it through the first month and wondering if I had milk supply problems. In five minutes of looking at this book I realized that:1. it would get SO much easier in a few weeks (if only someone had told me!);2. all my ""worries"" were actually normal behavior for a 3 week old baby. (If only someone had told me!)3. I too could feed lying down at night and actually get some sleep. (If only someone had told me!)If you're about to have a child - or if you're exhausted after only a few weeks and wondering if you can make breastfeeding work - then do yourself a favor and READ this book before you decide to quit, supplement, introduce a bottle, or switch to formula."
3,Really needs an index,"I'm going through my books to give to a friend about to have a baby (mine is 14 months old). This is not one that I will want to get back if I get pregnant again. I read the book toward the end of my pregnancy and while my baby was a newborn, and the information was interesting and helpful at the time. However, it was not a book I could easily use for reference when I had questions or concerns about my breastfeeding experience. The main problem is that it does not have an index. I didn't have the time or patience to re-read entire chapters with the hope I would come across the information I was seeking, so I turned to other books instead (such as The Nursing Mother's Companion). That being said, this book did provide a worthwhile introduction to breastfeeding, and some of the ""laws"" concerning milk supply (more nursing = more milk) really stuck with me."
4,Very detailed,"Unfortunately breast feeding hasn't been very simple for me thus far, but there is a lot of useful information in the book that will hopefully make sense for me in the coming weeks. Good detail around why breast milk is so important for little ones to help you stay motivated to keep with it."
5,Must read book,"As a board certified lactation consultant, I purchased this book for my daughter-in-law while awaiting the arrival of my first grandchild. I want my grandchild to be breastfed, but I also want my daughter-in-law to enjoy the experience. This book is very easy reading and has excellent advice for new mothers."
4,Good Read,"This is a good book about breastfeeding. It is a bit frightening how adamant they are about not supplementing with formula though. This is probably why some women feel defeated when they have to supplement. Overall, I did learn some things I would like to try when I start breastfeeding."
4,Lots of good info,"This book is excellent, simple and to the point. If you're a newbie like me, this covers many many questions and provides good solid answers."
5,The best book ever!!,"This is by far the best breastfeeding book I've ever read. Very clear and simple, I would buy it for every expecting mom I know!"
4,I'm not sure,"I bought this book for my daughter-in-law as my breastfeeding days were cut short due to a double bilateral modified radical mastectomy. However I personally used an old standby written by the LaLeche League, but the reviews for this one were so outstanding that I made the choice. My daughter-in-law hasn't talked about the book, but I have noticed it sitting on her end table marked for reference on several pages so I do assume she is using it regularly. I've also noticed that she has repositioned my grand son to make it more comfortable for the both of them while nursing."
2,Pay more & get something better!,"I liked the idea of not rolling a mouse around my desk; particularly since i have a laptop and i don't like the track pad at all.The Kensington Orbit was fantastic at first; up and running in seconds, easy to use and feels great in my hand.However, after approx. 3 months use, I find that the left-right action gets stuck very easily and is very hard to start again. Getting the ball out to clean the rollers is easy, but actually cleaning those tiny little rollers is a nightmare, much harder than a normal mouse.Plus, the rubber is so small it is deteriorating really quickly.I discovered the roller itself gets stuck inside the casing and doesn't spring back as it should, so the roller is not touching the ball.In conclusion: you get what you pay for: cheap and nasty!"
1,This thing [stinks],"When I first got it, it worked great. But within a couple weeks, the cursor movement was erratic and soon got to the point where it was unusable. So I pounded the [stuff] out of it and tossed it."
2,Kensington Orbit USB/PS2 Combo Mouse/Trackball,"I ORDERED THIS AND USED IT FOR 1 MONTH, THEN IT STOPPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER.I NOW AM WITHOUT A TRACK BALL."
2,Not what I expected.,"The trackball was advertised as PS/2 or USB. It turned out to be a Serial Port/ PS/2 and would not function with my equipment without special software which could not be loaded. I sent it back, no problems, and ordered a Kensington trackball from Walmart online which was advertised PS/2 or USB. It has worked perfectly with no software necessary, just plug and use. No fault of the trackball or the manufacturer."
1,Kensington Orbit 3D mouse,"I ordered this mouse..It was a ""used"" product..supposedly in good condition..The ball keeps ""slipping""..That is, you roll the ball and nothing happens... That happened to my old mouse exactly like this after years of use!"
1,Clogs too much (and hard to clean),"and then it moves erratically, or will only go sideways...drives me nuts. I will get the Expert Mouse trackball. Wish they had an optic one"
2,Uncomfortable design,"My Microsoft Intellimouse Trackball quit on me after long usage so I bought this one today at Circuit City. It wasn't an easy choice given all the confusing models on the shelves! I prefer the trackball design over the older ""moving"" mouse which was a real chore for me to use. Initially, the ball moved the curser quite quickly and freely around the screen. However, after about 10 minutes, I noticed myself frequently hitting the left button when I clearly didn't intend to.Also, my wrist became tense and would cramp up from using it. I think it was due to the wide frontal design. I put my old Intellimouse in its place and found I didn't have the pain nor discomfort. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this mouse based on my own experience with it. I think I'll get another Intellimouse which I would recommend."
3,Chip quality.,"It is responsitive mouse but tiny balls which hold the big ball made from plastic. Terefore ball turns to hard , it makes pointer jump.To difficult move pointer to exact place on the screen."
2,Fantastic At First -- But Incredibly Short Life...!,"I liked this mouse fine -- and the first time it went out on me in a relatively short amount of time I figured I would give it the benefit of the doubt and get another. The second one, also, lasted only a very short time (less than 6 months). Then I got a third one, and this one started acting screwy within the first few months. It is AWFUL. I can't believe they charge this much for something so lame.Don't waste your money."
4,Switch to trackball,"It takes a little getting used to, but the change is so much easier on your wrist.I'm thinking of going to the optical, however, as the rollers in this mouse do wear down over time.Either way, this product is comfortable and recommended."
4,Scalp Tingling,Nice oil for the scalp. Rub it in and you can smell and feel the interaction of the Rosemary and other herbs. Stimulating. Good stuff.
3,"eh, it was only $4, so its fine.","The picture & description are misleading. & when the box came in the mail, it looked like it was a long shade for the BACK window.BUT, its just a regular small shade, but the suction cups are nice to use instead of having to roll down the window to clip it on like others."
1,Bad quality!,"The shade material is terrible quality and was ""pockmarked"" upon opening. It tore after very little contact. The bottom suction cup holder was on backwards, and the suction cup doesn't even work. Do not buy this product!"
5,UNBELIEVABLE!!!,"The Red and Yellow books were bought for my son in 1982.He was never very fond of the books. However, as a childcare program owner, I am able to share books with hundreds of other children. Well, the Yellow and Red Books have been an all time hit with every preschool group we've had. The children (...)are in love with the books and are upset because the tapes are wearing out and we can not hear them too well. Were we surprised to find out we could purchase them again!! They are great for developing wordrecognition and listening skills. These stories are enjoyable. We are sooooo happy to share with you and (Susan Batko) the years of joy these books have provided.(...)Thank You!!!!(...)"
2,Not what I thought.,I love these books. I bought them because I thought I was going to get the cassettes to go with them since I Already have the books. The picture was misleading and the tapes were not wit the books. At least it was cheap!
2,Searching for Media--,Forget it. To often the system could not find the wireless Lan. The software for the PC is probably not made for the latest Xp versions.Much better products now on the market.10 july 2006
1,Incompatibility of DMS1 with Rhapsody v 3,I was advised by Omnifi Support that the Media Player may not work well with the new Rhapsody version 3 software. That's definitely a major drawback.
2,illustrations too cartoon-y!,"The written material is fine, but I have a problem handing out home programs that look like cartoons. In my experience, patients seem to understand handouts that are actual pictures of people performing these exercises, or at the very least, drawings that are more people-like. I do not like these illustrations at all!"
4,"Cute, enjoyable romantic comedy",I started working with a guy from India and have become interested in his culture. This is a Bollywood/Hollywood combination. The girl is gorgeous. The parents very stereotyped (unfortunately) but overall quite enjoyable.
3,Reminds me of Original Jersey Girl Movie from 90's,This is a really nice movie with light comedy and romance. The theme is so similar to Jersey Girl accept it's reversed with a young woman from India with a slight variation in story line. It's well worth the watch and rental but purchase price should be lower more like $5 (favorably)-$9.99 for those that like to collect these types of genre.
4,Good entertainment,"Shriya and Jesse definitely have an allure and a certain chemistry that blend into a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I found the ""fast moving traffic clips"" a little distracting and, in my opinion, not necessary. However don't allow that to detract from an entertaining, light story. The blend of Hollywood and Bollywood works. Why not? All the characters were neatly written. The acting was fine, and in some cases, top notch. The end reminded me of the final scene in ""An Officer and a Gentleman."" Shriya is beautiful to behold and I hope her talent is utilized more in Hollywood."
2,"Write your own, it matches","It starts the way you think it will. It ends the way you think it will. The pat scenes (she thinks he hooked up with his ex-, but he hasn't) are pretty trite. The slapstick, so-called, comedy of the East Indian family is disgraceful. It's a Lifetime movie wanna be..."
5,He's baaaaack!,"Q*bert for the PC is really great! You can play the classic game, an adventure game, or head-to-head with a friend. Don't worry about those fuzzy looking graphics on the back of the box; if you set the resolution to 600x800 or higher with all the features turned on, the graphics are excellent! (I personally have it set on 1024x768 for better backgrounds.) Don't worry about the system requirements as long as you have a 3D card. I have a Pentium 120 with 16 MB of RAM (waaaaaayyy under the system requirements! ), but I also have a fairly new 3D card, and the gameplay is very smooth with no slow-downs or delays, and I'm also running just about everything off the CD-ROM! :-) This game is a whole lot of fun for new and old Q*bert fans alike!"
5,Awesome line!,"I use this on myBlack & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Electric 12-Inch Grass Hog String Trimmer/Edger #NST2018and it has totally improved my performance. Not only does it cut better, but there's a lot less waste on line too. Takes 5 minutes to re spool with this product. VERY cost effective. Good job!"
1,Nothing New,"If you know Windows 98, then don't bother with this book, it's a rehash of Windows 98 info. There are very few new features in Win Me and fewer are explained. They are explained in the authors next book ""More Microsoft Windows Me Millennium Edition for Dummies"" which he urges us to buy. I'm not! Fooled me once."
1,Windows Me for Dummies,"Windows Me is an almost useless piece of fluff. Author Andy Rathbone goes to great lengths to explain what Windows Me can do, he however makes almost no atempt to explain how to do it. I found his scratchings on the Media player to be an especialy large waste of time. He listed in almost painfull detail exactly what Media Play could acomplish, he simly forgot to say how. Overall I would say purchasing this book was a waste of my time and money."
2,cute but confusin,"A. Rathbone seems more relentlessly intent on performing ""stand up"" comedy, or being unctiously cute than in giving useful, straight forward, instruction. As a complete begginner, I found his presentation aggravating. He needs an editor to weed out all his ""goofey"", material and get on with the info and instruction. Found the MaranGraphics series much more instructive, clear and concise."
5,"The perfect gift for ""everybody.""","Tuna sandwich on toasted cheese bread, hot fudge over vanilla ice cream (and the agony of deciding whether I should choose hot butterscotch), out on a teenage date with my Irish boyfriend. Schrafft's has special memories for so many of us. I discovered this when I presented several friends with the wonderful Christmas gift of ""When Everybody Ate at Schrafft's."" Everybody loves to receive this treasure."
5,Schraft's lover,My mother was the recipient of this gift and she worked in Schraft's in the 40's. She loved the book and it brought back a lot of memories and even taught her a few things she didn't know - a real task with my mother.She recommended it for anyone who worked or ate there.
2,When everyone ate at Schraffts,"As a native NYer, it was an easy, fun, jogging of memory,having had lunch there many times in the 1950s,after seeing my DDS on E 57th ST or when I worked in the Chrysler building.As a book, it was extremely ""lightweight"",not very well written, easy to put aside and TOO MANY RECIPES.I will,however. send it to our daughter, who had a summer job there & wore that black and white uniform and told us tales about the customers.So it was a pleasant little tome, but not one I'd recommend.Sorry !"
3,Good book but software demo needs improvement.,This book does a good job of describing the flaws with Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) as well as the proposed solution resulting in Post-MPT (Ch 1 and 4). The Visual Basic software demonstrates Post-MPT risk analysis of a single asset. I would have rated it a 5 if the software had demonstrated Post-MPT asset allocation among multiple assets. As it stands I have a choice of EITHER reverse engineering the software/spreadsheet and adding multiple assets OR purchasing third party software.
5,"As the daughter of Jerry Pacek, I might be bias","I grew up in Jerry Pacek's home, never knowing what had happened to him so many years before until I was about 13 myself. I was never allowed to read the book until I turned 18. With his death in 2004, I just couldn't bring myself to read his story because I knew partially what he went through. To know my father was a true gift. He was the nicest man you could ever meet and had friends everywhere! But to know him and also know his story just makes you think of what a great man he truly was. To go through this turmoil and be such a kind, caring human being is beyond me. It's a great book to read. Jim Fisher did a wonderful job proving that my dad was innocent and I am eternally grateful for that. If you have the chance, pick this book up. It's a good read. It'll both astonish you and anger you."
3,Depends on the Student,"I've been impressed by the content of the 3 ""History Pockets"" books we've used in our homeschool (Ancient Civilizations, Ancient Egypt, and Ancient Greece). I think they would be really helpful for visual and tactile learners. Unfortunately, my DD hated all the cutting & pasting involved. She found it to be busywork.I would recommend the ""History Pockets"" to students who don't mind all the prep work involved in making the folders/lapbook.Edited to update: my 2nd child turns out to love the ""History Pockets"" books. So it really goes to show that it depends on the particular student."
5,Great Activities!,"We're doing Sonlight's Core 1 this year, and this book coincides almost perfectly! My DS6 loves to do the projects, and they've helped him gain a deeper understanding of the civilizations. Definitely worth the buy."
4,Nice projects for anceint history,"I purchased the History Pockets Ancient Civilizations to go along with the Story of the World for my kindergartener this year. We have enjoyed working on most of the projects so far. We haven't done the postcards, because she is not really writing yet, but we loved the other projects for Mesopotamia and Egypt. Looking forward to completing the other pockets as we go along. I will definitely be looking into other History Pockets for our homeschool work in the future."
3,Not worth paying extra,"I got these thinking they might be more absorbant for the first few days my breast milk ""came in"", but I found it to be no more or less absorbant than the regular nursing pads by LANSINOH. It wasn't worth the extra I paid for them. I LOVE the LANSINOH Brandon and that is what I buy while nursing, but I won't go out of my way again to purchase these ""fancy"" ones."
3,Very theoretical approach to a practical system,"This book is heavy going- although as an elitist, Evola would doubtless take that as a compliment. I wouldn't mind if it contained more practical advice on how to actually DO Kundalini yoga, however the book is very theoretical rather than practical. Evola was actually a paraplegic for the last 29 years of his life- would this not have precluded him from actually doing kundalini yoga? I'd rather read a book by someone who actually does tantric yoga on a regular basis."
5,great movie,it's hot fuzz if you haven't seen it....see it hell for the price buy it ..if it's not for you there's always craigslist or friends who will enjoy it
3,Agatha Christie crossed with Ace Ventura,Not bad for a rental. 12 year old boys would probably enjoy it more than a 50 year old mom. A little slow and be prepared to embrace the British humor.
2,"Systematic, droll and easily dismissed.","I would of given this (book) zero to one stars, but since, my money was used to purchase it, I must reconsider. The idea of this plot, could and should be told, as a three sentenced idea in a drunken conversation, while at the graveyard, with all your dear Gothic friends. Out of date and style I wish they would refund my money so I could go get Flann O'Brien's 'Poor Mouth'."
1,False advertising,"Don't fall for the old ""The 50022 features a built-in ultra-bright blue LED charging indicator"" as it's not true. Sunforce Products says to use a voltmeter in their instructions. I'm going to spend $40-$300 on a voltmeter? Not me. Also the gal at Sunforce Products didn't know her stuff. She tried to tell me she was a tech. If that's their best I could snow her in 2 seconds. Amazon, where do you find these people? I'm not so stupid as to buy something and ignore false advertising. Books and DVDs ok. Something else I'll go somewhere else."
5,Battery trickle charger,"I have three of these panels. I use one to keep my ATV battery charged, One to keep my tractor battery charged and one to keep my boat battery charged. They work fine for that purpose."
5,"Capt Steve - ""Breaking Wind""",Performed as stated. Keeps my deep cycle marine battery charged. When Ileave my boat after sailing for 2-3 hours my 12V LED volmeter reads systemat 11.85 volts and the next day it is charged to 12.80 after receiving sunfor 10hrs. Tops it off - trickle charge as stated.
3,Not enough power to maintain a car battery,I found that 5 watts isn't enough to maintain a battery in a seldom driven car--especially in the winter.Fifteen watt panels and a charge controller are only slightly more expensive.
1,bad,"doesn't work, it's a piece of crap. no led indicator to show whether it works or not either! what a scam"
3,nothing spectacular,It doesn't seem to generate enough power to power a PC fan when it's cloudy.I bought the Coleman to supplement this one. It's producing power at 10 a.m. in the shade.
3,This just worked OK,"I have used the solar powered charger, which work just OK. But I have not used the pig tail yet. I may not need the pig tail."
3,This didn't help me,I bought this because my car has a GPS device to record where I go. The device is on all the time. When it is cold my battery would be dead on Monday morning from no driving during the weekend. This did not solve my problem. I do not fault the product.
1,Did not do the job,I bought this because my car battery kept dying. I installed in inside my car with the solar batter facing out my back window. It didn't help. After two weeks my car battery died again and the Sunforce Trickle Charger didn't help. So I can't recommend this product.
4,"Works Fine, but BE CAREFUL where you place it.","The black housing will naturally magnify heat, and if you place it on you dash expect your dash to crack the way mine did.Other than that, it's a fine product. I hooked it up to my dying battery and now the battery dies no more. This means I'm not constantly worrying about a dead battery when I leave town and return. I accidentally dropped the charger and the plastic housing cracked and luckily not the glass. One design feature this unit is missing is an indicator light that shows it is working. I guess the proof is in the pudding however when you turn the key and the engine fires up. Good product for the $, it does give you peace of mind."
3,Not enough power,"My wife's car got one for Xmas. The device was easy to install.Unfortunately, without disconnecting the battery, it doesn't provide enough power to keep the battery charged in the winter, when sun hours are few, even in California."
1,Melts under the sun,"First, there is no way to know whether this model is properly hooked up unless you happen to own a voltmeter.Second, there are no instructions showing you how to hook it up to the battery. The clamps came off the battery, but I think I just didn't do it right and when I laid them a different way they looked fine.BUT - the plastic casing melted when I left the unit on the dashboard! Hello - this is a solar battery but it can't be left in the sun?So disappointed because it got so many good reviews but I am returning it. I have left my car the same way under similar weather conditions for over 10 years, and I can guarantee you that the car never gets near the 175 degree maximum temperature rating in the instructions, which do not, by the way, suggest cracking the windows.I am returning it - my battery is now totally dead and I can't see keeping something which has started to melt after 2 weeks on the dashboard."
4,works well after 6 weeks,I have an old minivan that I drive every 3 months. Heck its paid for and I need to move people or something bulky every few months. This keeps the battery fresh. The starter leaps to life now rather than the old routine of requiring a charge after sitting idle for 4-6 weeks.
4,ok,"No complaints right now, keeping my to Rv batteries charged as far as I can tell ok product, helps with electric bill."
4,spk2dhand,prouduct seems to work well and has voltage keeping my battery charged while i am camping will also work great in storage when not in use . I would recommend this product.
5,Works As Advertised!!!,"The Sunforce 50022 does what it is suppose to and that is trickle charge. I hooked my multimeter to it in full sunlight and got a constant 24v charge. I bought this to trickle charge a UTV at my ranch because there are long periods of no use, and often times it is cold starting. As for the solar charger it is extremely well built and solid. It comes with quick change neg/pos clamps and cigarette lighter adapters and mounting screws."
4,compact and reliable charger for stanby battery,"I get this panel for temporary use in charging circuit for 120 amps/hr acid battery. That panel drive 320 mA aver. and keep my battery in a good chape, even I don`t drive my car for 5-7 days."
5,Excellent Solar Panel,"The Sunforce 50022 5W amorphous solar panel is fantastic. Rugged, exceeded all of the manufacturer's claims, and is reasonably priced. I highly recommend this product."
2,Did not work for us,"I bought this charger for my wife's Honda Civic. She parks her car in the employee lot at LAX airport when we travel internationally. It was in the parking lot on this charger for 3 weeks, and the car battery was dead when she returned after the trip.You'd think sunny SoCal would be a good location to use this product, but it did not work for us."
3,"Works, but doesn't suit my needs","Bought this to counter the battery drain caused by my aftermarket alarm (constant .3v drain). Car wouldn't start if not driven every two days. Even parking it on the street for maximum sunlight, it is only enough to allow me to lock and unlock my car doors, never provides enough power to actually start the car. A step in the right direction, but ultimately doesn't solve my problem. I just need a 400ft extension cable for a traditional trickle charger (street parking FTL).Also, battery clips broke after the first week of usage. I sourced aftermarket alligator clips to replace them."
4,Can kill your battery,"The male part of the 2 pin connector from the solar cell is negative voltage. If you use their battery clamp adapter, it will charge your battery.On some 2 pin quick disconnects with ring terminals, like the one listed on Amazon under Frequently Bought Together, the female part is intended to be positive. It is marked red and is fused. Using one of these will send negative voltage and kill the battery door nail dead. It took Auto Zone 3 days to recharge my new battery.My application requires terminal ring disconnects. Sunforce should provide a terminal ring 2 pin quick disconnect with the positive marked red and fused as part of their package. If they send me one, I'll change my rating to 5 stars."
3,Might be okay for small batteries,"I bought this Sunforce 5 watt solar charger to keep my RV battery ""topped off"" and it MIGHT do ok if the sun shined 24/7...but it doesn't. If you're looking for something to help keep, say, a gate opener battery charged up it might work fine. There is no light as claimed to indicate it's charging so I checked the output with a voltmeter with full sun and it puts out about 25v and that's a good thing. The downside is you might be disappointed if you buy this to keep a normal size deep cycle battery charged. Hindsight tells me I should have gone with a MINIMUM of 10 watts (and that might be cutting it to close)."
3,Worked great for 3 years.,This solar panel worked great for 3 years then stopped providing any voltage to the controller. I took it off the roof and dissenbled it. I found the ground wire disconnected from the panel. I managed to solder it back in place and also re-soldered the positive wire to the panel to ensure conductivity. It has provided reliable service since then. But for someone of less techinal abiltity they are going to probably throw it out. What a shame.
4,Sunforce 50022 5 Watt Solar Battery Trickle Charger,In the past after a couple of weeks in the hot Florida sun the battery on my boat would be dead. Now that I have connected the Solar charger battery has a full charge when I get ready to go. No having to plan ahead and connect a battery charger over night and disconnect the next morning before leaving.Works Great Not a bad price either.
5,Perfect,"Was looking for a trickle charger for the battery in my standby generator and chose this one. Delivery was very fast, hooks up easy, works well. Very satisfied."
3,Works but flimsy,"I bought 3 of these over time for different locations. I wish I could give 3.5 stars. It is the only panel I could find at this electrical rating and price category. I'll probably buy another if I need one, but I wish there were an alternative.The solar panel itself works well. It maintains the charge on a 12V security system type battery as long as the solar gain is adequate. If you have a week of rain, you might need another source, depending on your latitude. It needs to be carefully mounted on a sturdy surface or it will bend and crack. The wiring is flimsy and the connection system minimal (provide your own spade connectors...). The packaging for shipment was also poor."
2,good for a year,"I got my panel in September, connected it to my boat at it kept the battery charged all winter. I took the boat out twice in May and the battery was strong, but when I took it out in the first week of June it was dead. Got the jumper cables started the boat, ran it for 10minutes, shut it off and started back up with no problem. We went up the river for 20 minutes and I decided to plug in the charger to make sure the battery stays charged, but 3 hours later battery was completely drained. When we got home I charged the boat battery again by connecting it to my truck battery for 15 minutes and did not plug in the solar charger afterwards. The next day the boar started right up which leads me to believe that the solar charger was draining the battery. The solar charger looks like it is well made, rugged and water proof and it did it's job for about 9 month... not long enough in my opinion."
2,Battery Drainer,"This solar ""charger"" did nothing but drain my car battery. Was left in direct sunlight at all times and only to return to a dead battery one week later. Don't waste your money."
1,What's the use ... ?,"I order this product once and it arrived inside its own manufacturing packaging box surrounding a clamshell plastic packing, and that inside an Amazon box with a little bit of crumpled paper around it. When I opened it up, the glass was shattered. So I returned it and had them ship me another one. That package arrived without any Amazon packaging and just the thin cardboard box around the clamshell plastic. Again, shattered. It may be a great product, but if they can't get it to you in one piece, what's the use. I will never know. I returned the second one and I have ordered something else from another manufacturer. Hopefully that will arrive in one piece."
1,24V instead of 12V,"I discovered after opening and testing it; the equipment is supposed to produce 12V output. However, it produces 24V, which is also indicated in the back label, but not in the manual. What to do?Quality seems to be good, but it does not work with the rest of the equipment I purchased."
3,you need to get the charger for it,"you need to get the charger for it, without it it is useless and does not charge anything, in fact it will ruin your battery. Not sure why they are not sold together..... would give it a nice combination price :)"
1,Showed up broken,"Received this product from Amazon within 1 day, but it showed up broken. The packaging is not suitable to protect the glass during standard shipping. Without an opportunity to actually use this product, the quality of the plastic frame and dc connections were very poor quality. I would not purchase this product again, despite all the reviews."
4,Nice little trickle charger,"I pretty much used and abused this thing to keep my hot wire fence battery charged. As long as the sky was clear, it could keep up with the fence."
5,Darkness at Noon,"I was assigned this book (among a variety of others) as a part of a college class on European History. I assumed that it would be a typical history book - dull, boring, and repetitive. I was excited when I realized this book was anything but what I had expected. Koestler creates a fascinating read that captures the period as well as any work of historical fiction I have had the pleasure of encountering. I would absolutely recommend this book to any casual reader, and the work should be a must-read for any history nerd like myself."
1,Boring,"A friend of mine, an English major in college, gave me this book to read. In a nutshell- the boring missives of a commie who fell out of favor with the other commies. Nothing happens in the book, the main character, a weasely little left wing politician, just drones on and on until the reader falls asleep. Skip this book."
2,Sad,Here is a man who believed in communism that got caught up in the unfortunate drama during the Stalin Years. Sad. Difficult to read since I see what is happening today even in our country and rather keep my head in the sand. The danger is around in such an insedious way that I am too afriad to talk about it. Similar to the Stalin years..
3,Great book,"A really Interesting read, felt like I was getting an insider's view into the communist revolution. I say check it out."
4,Fiction is rarely as good as reality,"I had recently read Gulag Archipelago which I thought was magnificent. As so many reviews recommended this book by Koestler, I decided to read it. It held my attention, but I did not find it eye-opening. And the rather long and convoluted ""justifications of bad behavior"" put into the mouth of examiner Ivanov I found artificial and tedious. I guess it would be interesting to a sociologist, which Koestler was. It would have been much more interesting to me to read what Koestler experienced himself, at first embracing Communism and later becoming disenchanted with it. This was the course of the main character's beliefs, but then I find that fiction is never as interesting as the true story. I imagine that Koestler didn't see his secretary put to death because of his refusal to admit his own guilt. If he had he certainly would have been able to write a more poignant description of his conflicted emotions."
4,Good sci-fi from Piers Anthony,"Cluster is the first book in a 5-book sci fi series from Piers Anthony. It is highly recommended for entertainment. Follow the adventures of Flint, a cave-man in a futuristic universe. The alien species created by Mr. Anthony are very interesting both culturally and anatomically. The commentary on inter-species prejudice is a valuable reflection upon modern society. This is a short book, about 300 pages."
2,ehh,ok first off I love piers anthony but this book was ok at best kinda dragged on it was a time waster which is why i got it but there are better books out there
3,"A Camp David ""veteran"" reports","Having served at Camp David from 1975 to 1977 as the Commanding Officer of the Marine Security Company, I was extremely interested in what Mr. Walsh had to write about the official ""Presidential Retreat""....I was reminded of the day when a much younger Richard Cheney (then Chief of Staff to President Ford) and his wife Lynn got stuck in heavy snow as they were driving to the camp in a VW Beetle...the Sgt. of the Guard and I went to their aid in a jeep and got then safely to Camp David!...President Carter loved playing softball and would occasionally form some of his Secret Service agents and pilots into a team and play the Marines...if I recall correctly, the Leathernecks usually managed to come out on top!...anyway, Mr. Walsh's research certainly paid off as he is right on target in describing the Naval Support Facility, Thurmont, Maryland....for someone interested in a combination of American history and presidential politics. this book is a must."
4,Interesting inside information,"Everyone needs a place to ""get away from it all."" While presidents are never free from the responsibilities of their office, especially with modern technology, each president has a place to get away as much as possible, and this book tells us about them.It is interesting to read about how they chose their get-aways, and what they do while they're at their favorite places. I learned more about the physical layout and multiple projects going on at Prairie Chapel Ranch (current President Bush's favorite get-away), and Camp David, a weekend retreat of presidents since Franklin Roosevelt.""From Mount Vernon to Crawford"" is an informative, fun, and easy read."
2,not good for chewers,This item is a great idea but my Britney Spaniel figured a better way to get to the food or treats was to just chew right through the plastic. Maybe if I supervised him and encouraged him it would be better but I bought it so I could keep him occupied while I was away. Hope this hint helps other dog owners.
2,Wither Whithers !,"Just when this story threatens to get interesting, there is some unbelieveably bad dialog. I recommend you get it from your local library to read and not spend any money on it."
4,COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!!,"If you like horror, don't miss this one! Great believeable characters! It was so easy to step into this one and be right there with them. Mr Passarella, DON'T QUIT NOW!!!!!"
3,I can't decide WITHER or not this book is good ....,"This book is like a candy bar; it tastes good but is ultimately unsatisfying. I felt the characters were cliche and had little depth. The subplots were woven nicely and I liked the college-town setting, but ultimately it read like a second rate X-Files episode without Mulder and Scully.Ultimately, it's a fun and quick read that one can whip through in a couple of days, but don't expect a whole lot of depth."
5,Entertaining and it really sucks you in!,"With a cast of relatable and likeable characters, Passarella weaves a tight tale of a New England town that has a slight problem. Three centuries-old witches are back and want a few good bodies to begin a new life in the modern world. Great suspense with a tastefull amount of gore made this book an enthralling read. Can't wait for the movie!"
5,Woo Hoo!! Best horror in a long time!,"I really liked this book. The characters are all likable and the story unpredictable. This book brings me back to the days when many good horror novels were coming out. Hopefully, we will see some more pasarella books to reinject some life into the stale horror genre. Great fun!! The running through the cow scene actually disgusted me!! Far out, dudes!!"
3,"Like champagne, starts with a pop but fizzles out","In the beginning, the author does a great job of establishing the atmosphere and background for the story. Wither has a compelling start and main characters that I initially cared about, but it became a bit dull and predictable at the halfway point. The plot and pacing remind me of TV horror movies from the 1970s."
3,"Well-written, slightly predictable horror novel","Windale Massachusetts is a small town with a past. In 1699 three women were hanged as witches. Now the town uses their past to lure tourists. What no one realizes is the women really were witches and they're still alive, hibernating in a barn deep in the woods. But every 100 years they awaken, choosing someone's dreams to appear in and feed from their energy. It's 1999, and Wendy Ward is one of the women having terrible dreams. She is also a modern witch practicing white magic. She performs a ritual meant to dispel her nightmares but instead welcomes the ancient witches into the physical world, where they pursue Wendy, a pregnant professor at the college and a small girl.Wither is a pretty good supernatural novel. Passarella creates believable characters and keeps the story moving forward well. Some of the situations are predictable and he veers into purple prose occassionally. It's not going to blow you away but it's an enjoyable read."
3,"A brisk, engrossing read","Though I would have welcomed a deeper exploration of some of the hinted-at thematic issues (feminine power, for one), I still found this an engrossing story that moved along at a brisk clip. I have a few minor quibbles with some of the historical details, and I was a little discomfited that Wendy's spellcasting amounted to little more than a thrill-seeker's dabbling. But so what? If you take this novel for what it is - an entertaining story and nothing more - then you won't be disappointed. I greatly enjoyed the appearances of the monstrous 'witches' - these beings were very frightening, indeed, and the author conveyed their menace without overdoing it. You won't find much emotional resonance here, but if you're looking for a good, scary book to take to the beach or on an airplane, this is it."
3,Wither,"Wither, by J.G Passarella is somewhat confusing, difficult and mind turning. It is confusing because the author jumps from one character to the next. For example, ""She jumped out of her seat, Art walked up the stairs"". It is also difficult because the author makes the readers think that the dreams that are drept are actually real. Wither is also mind turning because it has excitment. Wither kept me on edge. What happened next surprised me. Everyone likes a book like that."
1,deleriously awful; badly written; silly plot,"Am I the only one who thought this book's best use is in my fireplace? What's the average age group of the above-reviewing readers, I wonder? This clunker of a book is the equivalent of a Saturday night made-for-tv movie you watch because you're too sick to be bothered to try and find something better to watch. An UTTER waste of time."
5,i highly recommend the wendy ward trilogy!,"when i first saw wither i didnt think much about it and put in in my pile of to be read. then someone recommended it to me, it was the best recommendation i have recieved! as soon as the second book came out i grabbed it up! these 2 wendy ward books are truly spookalicious! i cant wait to read the third book coming out in october! john passarella is one of the best writers i have come across! thank god it was recommended to me!if you love horror, love witch stories this is for you! superbly written and simply enchanting! highly recommended to all!"
5,Excellent!,I found this book to be an excellent read. I wasn't quite sure if the book would be to my liking but wow was I wrong. I couldnt seem to put it down and as I got deeper and deeper in the book I couldnt!
2,yawn,"I am frankly appalled that so many people recommend this book so highly. It's not that it's bad; it's just not very good. The writing is mediocre and lacks anything to distinguish it. The story has a lot of potential and is, frankly, pretty cool, but it's executed in a completely boring fashion. Passarella draws the story out so long that you just don't care what happens in the end. This is genre fiction at its most ubiquitous: formulaic, boring, and over-rated."
1,doesn't deserve the hype,"I was shocked to hear that this book won the Bram Stoker award for best first novel for one important reason: it's not very good. With sketchy characters and a sophomoric writing style, Wither is an utterly forgettable book. There is plenty of good horror fiction being published these days (I recommend Waiting by Frank M. Robinson or Superstition by David Ambrose as two great examples) that deserve distinction. Wither is not one of these."
5,COMPLETELY LOVED IT,as an avid horror reader i found this book to be one of the best it only took two days to finish it...it was fast paced and perfectly creepy...the characters were well developed and interesting...all in all a wonderful excellant five star read...
3,COOL READ,"Not a bad first novel. I enjoyed the descriptions and the way the author created the mood for the story. If you're looking for entertainment you won't be disappointed. I don't think it was worthy of any award though. If you're into this type of horror, I recommend you try another good first horror novel Windows To the Soul by J. M. Barlog. It also takes place on a college campus and delves into demon worship along with cults on campus."
3,The movie should be good.,"This book was entertaining and I loved the spooky descriptions of the old woods and the old abandoned mill. I got a good 'mind picture' of the quaint little town, too. The whole idea of an ungodly curse on this little New England town intrigued me. But.....I couldn't get caught up too much with the main characters and their nightmares. Mostly, I just couldn't `care' about them enough. The Wendy and Alex so-called romance didn't light any fires for me, either. Also, I expected more information explaining some of the weird stuff. Too many unresolved questions for me to give this book more than 3 stars. Borrow from the library or a friend or just buy the paperback. Better yet, wait for the movie. I AM looking forward to the movie. I think it could be really scary."
1,a slight disappointment,"I was disappointed with this one. It isn't the worst book I've read, but the author needed a better editor. The writing is excellent in some places, but unclear and redundant in others. The premise is interesting, but I could never shake the overwhelming sense that this book wanted to be a TV movie -- a bad TV movie. Most of the characters seemed a tad stupid, and more than a tad shallow."
1,Most disappointing.,"Despite an interesting premise and setting -- the revival of 17th century witches in a 20th century New England college town during the Halloween season, this novel relies on the typical elements of modern horror, i.e., profanity, sex and graphic violence. For a truly scary read, try one of the old masters of the supernatural, such as Henry James or Edith Wharton, who knew that by engaging the reader's mind and tweaking his or her imagination, extremely frightening results could be achieved."
3,Creepy!,"Very captivating storyline. What I appreciated the most about this novel was the unique imagination of the author ... definitely unlike anything I have ever read before. I'm not an avid horror reader, but I have read a number of the more popular ones in this genre. The plot moves well, but the characters were in need of better development. Some of the main principals came across two-dimensional. In spite of an overall satisfying ending, there were unfortunately a few unanswered questions ... such as (1) why in particular were these three characters chosen? (2) why were the witches after Karen's baby? (3) what ever happened in regards to the growing relationship between Wendy and Alex? All in all, however, I would consider this a good scary story, even though it isn't necessarily one of the best."
2,Rather Disappointing,"Nice start, a little choppy. You can wait for the paperback. It's a good first book, nothing more. I do agree with another reader who says it reads like a made for tv show."
2,"More organization, editing & focus needed, but great photos.","I enthusiastically ordered this book after hearing a good interview with the author. I was rather disappointed with the book. The photos of album covers and insides, with the narrative comments, were a lot of fun. But the author seems to include reasonably clear clues, speculation, idle speculation and bizarre speculation all on the same level. Its hard to know what to take seriously as the book wanders throughout all of those. Would have been a more enjoyable read if better organized, edited and focused."
2,"A FASCINATING TOPIC, BUT NOT THROUGHLY RESEARCHED","Patterson does a thorough job of reprinting/rewriting a lot of old Rolling Stone articles, but doesn't go the extra distance in tracking down the behind-the-scenes story of this great rock 'n' roll rumor. Anyone who is interested in this topic is urged to seek out the book TURN ME ON, DEAD MAN by Andru Reeve, available thru Amazon Books. I found it to be the superior of the two books, though Reeve's book is a bit pricey (I paid $35 for my copy)."
3,Not worth the 40 plus price,"I guess if you played the who series of Command and Conquer games from the beginning then it may be worth getting the game for sentimental reasons...but otherwise it is not worth spending this much for a game, when all that is good is the last game in the series. Its fun, a good waste of time but nothing special."
2,much better games are available,C&C; games are old and primitive. Much better RTS games are available today. recommended:codename panzerswar frontcompany of heroesrise of legendsWW3 black golddawn of warworld in conflictground control 2universe at warSoldiers Heroes of WW2Sword of the starsAct of WarSteel SoldiersAll available on Amazon !
4,Long time C&C fan,"Once upon a time, in the days of DOS, there came a strategy that was a blast to play. Then Windows came along and the game didn't play as well, but a new version came out for Windows. Time went by and now XP is our Operating System of ""choice"". None of the previous versions would work.When I saw the ad for this game, I thought I would give it a try and see if it was like I remembered. It was better! The game I like best in the series is Renegade - I like first person shooters. I completed the mission set at the lowest level and look forward to going back ant replaying at tougher levels.If you are a dyed-in-the-wool Command and Conquer fan, this one's for you. Make sure you've got the computing power for the game. Graphics get a little sloppy in intense situations, even with a 128 MB video card on a 2.7 GHz system with 1.5 GB RAM."
3,C&C the first decade,The game speaks for itself as far as gameplay. I did have a few compatability issues with the software but with a little patience and a lot of reloads it finally loaded everything and plays very well.
4,Fun game ... hard to configure network play,"I found this game was difficult to get configured for network based play ... and I have a computer science degree! The documentation is aweful, as well as the configuration interface.However .... once you get this configured, it is awesome to play. I purchased two copies so my son can play networked with another friend. They continue to spend countless hours playing. There goes my laptop."
1,JUNK DO NOT BUY,installed and wont even work. i tried all compatablities. and from reading other reviews if you do get it to work the games are missing all kinds of content. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
2,Doesn't work well on newer versions of Windows.,"Great classic game, but unfortunately doesn't work too well on newer CPU's with the latest in operating systems. Right now using it as a paper weight..."
2,Games are good; issues with functionality,These are excellent computer games; however the issue I had is with functionality as most had running issues. C&C and Red Alert had screen corruption in terms of colour. Renegade couldnt start. However the the Tiberian sequels and Generals did function. (Toshiba L35-S2366 W7)
3,Great package; shoddy packaging,"This package of games is great. It includes every Command and Conquer (to my knowledge) from the original to Generals: Zero Hour./But/, the game is buggy. It just shouldn't be. Plus, hunting down patches is difficult. There is no automatic installer, and their website seems to obscure the important information. It's like they sold you a box with a broken hinge, and although they apparently made a replacement hinge, they hid it in the jungle.Plus, the colors on the old games (at least Red Alert) get very buggy. Would this have been /that/ hard to fix? And if it wasn't fixed, why'd you sell it?EA tends to put a good amount of effort into their games, but they neglect to go the last 10% of the way."
4,Great game,"I have alsways loved the command and conquer series of games, this collection lets me play on my new computer system."
2,Doesn't work with win7,"Most of the games won't install or play on Win7 64-bit. I can still play generals, but the rest are unplayable."
2,No Online or Network Play,"The network card isn't even recognized in Red Alert 2. Generals and Zero Hour don't even start - they crash right away. I use Windows 7 Pro 64bit. So if you're a Windows 7 user, the only game worth playing is RA2, and you have to play with yourself...If you already own a legit copy of RA2 and you like to play it online, I suggest you follow these directions:[...]"
3,A good buy if your willing to tinker with Win 7,"The game is advertised as an XP compatible game. I like many other customers presumed you could just go into the Win 7 compatibility mode and run the game in XP. This was not the case, after a somewhat lengthy period of time troubleshooting the Win 7 compatibility mode I was able to play some of the games. It was somewhat frustrating that almost every one of the games required different settings in the compatibility mode. But after tinkering with the individual games, I was able to get about 80% of them to run in Win 7. All in all, a good buy if you're willing to tinker with the compatibility mode."
1,CRC errors and other problems,"I loved the C&C; games from the 90's and was happy to see that EA made them to run on XP now.I got two of these for Xmas in 2006. One from my wife, the other from my mother-in-law.One had 5 CRC errors in various files stating ""The medium from which you are running the setup may be corrupted....."" After the fifth I got the great ""Catastrophic failure"" and off it went.The second managed to go through the install with 13 CRC errors but never a Catastrophic failure, but it would not play properly (of course).So I took my wife's back to CompUSA and exchanged it with no problem for a third one..........got the first CRC error in the same file and decided I wasn't going through with the rest this time and aborted the whole thing.I'll be calling EA in the next couple days to figure out what is wrong. I'm glad everyone has been able to load it, but I just have got screwed on three different ones. Never even heard of that from any of my friends. Maybe I am doing something wrong."
5,About patching.....,Im a C&C; fanatic! and ill let you know that im also involved in the modding communtiy for these AWESOME games. A program has been created to correctly patch this compilation. Go download this helpful tool and your lovely games will be patched and ready to play like they should be.[...]
4,command & conquer and red alert doesn't work at my pc,"I bought C & C first decade today, and was hoping to play the original games on XP. I've installed it and tried everything, but i can't get the original command & conquer and red alert to work. I hear the sound but the only thing i see is a foggy blur or it's all black. The other games work perfectly, i've got windows XP and a 19 inch flatscreen with minimum resolution of 800 x 600, i don't know if it's got anything to do with that. (i've tried the patch, i run it without antivirus, i've updated my drivers and i tried compatibility), but it still doesn't work.DOES ANYONE HAVE A SOLUTION FOR ME?"
1,DVD Is a coffee coaster,"With a higher end system I tried to install the DVD and found constant ""file not Win32"" compatible errors, so I wan't able to install the game. Before you ask, I play WOW, COH, RV6 Vegas and other high end games using DVD, it's not a system error, it's just another crap EA product."
4,A Good Buy,"If you like the C&C universe of games, then this is for you! All the C&C games up to Generals with their expansion packs! Installation was easy for me and the dll error mention is covered in the read me and once you finish installation, all games run great. I had Red Alert, C&C95, C&C: Tiberan Sun, Renegade, and Generals, but this was such a good buy that it was really worth it. The only complain I have is they still have a problem in the original Red Alert that causes the game to crash under even XP with a invalid page fault at times so that hasn't been fixed, otherwise a great set of C&C games for a good price. (You can even play the bonus games without the original CDs. Read the readMe.)"
5,Great Item!,"This game was in great brand new condition. I like every campaign. If your not a command and conquer fan, once you play this you will be!"
2,Is this a bootleg?,"I have seen this game with cover as shown in the picture and color manuals, poster, and disks that were screen printed like the cover that is shown. The disks that arrived are cheaper in quality and the poorly cut book wreak of being a bootleg. I don't know whether installing the program is a good idea or not. Can anyone tell me if EA started packaging the game differently than what is shown in the picture? It's shady to say the least."
1,Disc drive didn't even load the game,Didn't even start up on my computer. So I really don't know how this game is. Both discs don't work. All my other games and music CD'S and Movies work on this computer.
4,having trouble connecting for online play???,I have got the first decade finally working and let me tell you it was a pain in the a#% getting it to connect online for online for internet play. This is he set up I have and what I did to fix the problem.. I have dsl running xp pro and a wireless linkis g router make sure no ports are blocked first then go into you network properties right click and click properties and uncheck Qos packet scheduler. For some reason this worked for me I hope this has helped someone out there because it took me a week to figure out how to connect to the net with it other than that the game is a great buy
1,Didn't recieve the game or security code in the manuel,"I had been looking forward to the game for 4 days, then when opened it, it only had the Bonus DVD, and no game. Then when I found my old copy, i looked for the manual that had the code in it and that was not there. I do not suggest ordering from this person. You will not get what you need."
3,some of the games went blarggg,the game got here fast and installation was easy. the nearly ten gigabyte install is rough but fun..on my disc the other games like tiberium sun didn't work due to a dll error but i think it was rare
4,A classic return,"You get all 12 C&C; games on a single DVD-ROM. The biggie: The titles have been tweaked/updated to run well on modern Windows XP PCs (hopefully, this will also work fine with the upcoming version of Windows, called Vista).Not much has really changed from the original titles. The reasonable $39.99 buys you a package of 12 awesome RTS titles on a single disc that runs on modern PCs. Videos/audio have not been remastered/remade. The idea was to keep the games as close to the originals as possible. The games that support multiplayer still do. So there you have it:Every C&C; game in the past 10 years optimized to run on WinXP. Enjoy."
5,Old School,I havent played any of the C&C series since around 1996-97. This package let me go way back to my childhood. The game was extremely cheap especially compared to what I remember paying then. There were slight technical difficulties with the game. The color scheme seems to be off. There are weird shades of green and pink that shouldnt be there. But it does not affect game play at all.
4,Command and Conquer,"Excellent buy. It is great to revisit the old style command and conquer that i remember from middle school as well as the new ones. And i had never played the shooter before which was better than i expected. This was well worth the 20 dollars (which included shipping). I bought a used one and it had already been registered for online use which was a major disappoint however. Buy it new, playing the computer gets really old."
3,But is it readable without a magnifying glass?,"I agree with many of the other reviews here except that reading this book is real WORK. Why would a publisherselect such a small font size? Even with reading glasses (which I need only for crossword puzzles ordinarily) I couldnot read this text and the interspersed comments were even smaller. Bottom line: content; five star, but theproduction decisions, one star."
4,A very interesting read,"This book was very good: centering on Muslim dress, it branches off into politics, religion, personal style and globalizing fashion. It covers some of the difficulties Muslim women encounter when wearing hijab. The author does a great job of showing just how complex this topic really is. This book is also fun - I loved seeing all the varieties of dress Muslim women wear. I believe the book breaks down the stereotypical image of a Muslim woman in black from head to toe."
5,Better than IntelliMouse!,"Better because the included software allows programming ""wheel button"" to several different specialized operations (Next Window is my favorite). 100% compatible with IntelliMouse. However, if you try use the Kensington software with a real IntelliMouse there can be problems using this feature because the wheel in and IM has weaker springs and you will inadvertantly press the wheel button over and over when you scroll. Better because it is a lot less expensive but constructed just a good."
3,Good choice if you don't want a mute button,"The phone is attractive, and can sit either face up or face down. It is large enough to be fairly comfortable to use, unlike many modern phones which are too small to cradle on your shoulder. The earpiece goes out in the middle, though, which hurt my ear after half an hour. Unfortunately, the phone does not have a mute button. It has a mysterious button with the label RE/PA which is identified in the product manual on Coby's website as a mute button, but the mute effect lasts only for 5 seconds, which may be a defect only with my unit or it may be designed that way. It is hard to find a cordless phone which is large enough to be comfortable and doesn't interfere with one's wireless network, so if you don't care about a mute button, it's a good choice. I'm almost sad to be sending mine back, but a mute button is essential for me."
4,Good case,"As far as I can tell it's a good case, it has padding inside but it is still quite roomy so you can fit more than a bow inside if it's not too big. I put my quiver in there too and there is still some extra space. Of course that's because I don't have a 70 inch bow.Only downside is though it's pretty much expected from the picture because you get what you see nothing more or less, literally it's shipped as it is in a box, is there isn't a strap for you to sling it across your shoulder. Now I'm not sure how many people toss this in the trunk or prefer to carry it by the handle but it is kind of annoying especially where I live to be holding something in that angle.Regardless great for the price comparatively to other bow cases."
5,Good for bathtub!! Keeps them occupied - and having fun!,"Our son is 3 years, almost 4. I gave him this bath toy - Gone Fishin' tonight while he was in the bathtub - and he had a blast. It certainly got him in the bathtub quickly and he asked to take them out of the tub to play with as well. It's a great bathtub toy - and kept our son busy - and not putting his mouth in the water.. ugh. A+++++ Good stocking stuffer, or extra ""little gift"" too."
4,Just like a previous owned set,"My daughter received this two years ago for Christmas and we just purchased a second set for her this Christmas. The first set was so much fun for her in the bathtub and she even played with it out of the tub too. The problem is that, just like most non-vinyl bath toys, these started to mold after a while. We tried to clean them but the mold was on the interior fabric layer. I say we got about a year's use out of them which wasn't bad."
2,Soaks up too much water,My daughter loves this toy but not in the bath. It soaks up too much water and then is too heavy for the magnet.
1,Magnet was very weak and sewn terribly,"First of all, the picture shown here is not the one I received. I received the ocean version although the sticker on it said pond. You should check your information here- which is which? Second, the magnet of the fishing pole is sewn very poorly so the magnet moves around and is very weak. It does not make a good connection at all. I bought a version of this locally and came to Amazon to get the other version to give to my nephews for Christmas. It turns out I couldn't give either one because the quality was so different. The local one was excellent, this was was very poor!"
4,Happy so far with the transplanter,Used this over the weekend to transplant some of my bulbs. Worked well. Will know in June if the bulbs were ok with the move. Only 4 stars because it was difficult to clean the shovel after use.
4,Nice little tool,"It seemed like all my gardening tools decided to fall apart this spring, so I picked this tool up along with a Fiskars 3 piece gardening tool set. The tool set worked great on my clay soil in the garden, but seemed to be overkill on my little flower bed in the front yard. This 'transplanter' shovel worked great to dig out any stray weeds and transplant those little seedlings into their new home. The 48 little plants went in so quick and easy that I actually had time to sit back and admire my work! I really like this new little tool!!!"
1,A Toy,"I used this shovel for two days. About 2 1/2"" of the tip broke off one the first rock I encountered. I'm a bit surprised everybody else says ""strong."" But thanks to Amazon's great return policy, I'm not out any money and am very grateful for that. Maybe mine was defective. I still can't recommend it."
5,Essential Transplanting Shovel!,"I used this transplanter to move flowers from one garden to another, and the long slender body of the shovel makes it very easy for digging them up and moving them to the other garden spot. The long handle makes it easy for leverage to help dig up the plants. The shovel is very light weight, and an essential for every gardener! I highly recommend this shovel."
1,crap,dont bye thiese paintballs they brakeall guns dont wast ur time u want good quality that wont clogf and brake ur guns go to the nearest sporting goodstore that carries guns and paintballs im warning u ur just waseting ur time and save ur money
1,Out of Sync,"Just a quickie comment: The soundtrack to Special Delivery is approximately 4 seconds ahead of the movie, so you hear Cantor blow his whistle and four seconds later you see him put it to his mouth.I am constantly amazed at the carelessness of these stupid people who put out these silent films. When they do get a decent soundtrack, they can't even bother to synchronize it up to the picture. Shameful, unforgiveable and unbelievable.If you don't mind a ruined soundtrack, OR if you don't mind using Final Cut to sync up the sound, this is a very entertaining movie."
3,"Homemade Root Beer, Soda,&pop",I found the recipes in the book were good but there was no information as to where to get bottles or the capping machine listed. If you can't bottle the root beer it doesn't do any good to have the recipes found in the book.
2,Sasafrass not leagle,"ONe of the main ingredients for the root beers in this book is sassafras, which is illegal, and causes liver damage. The Ginger beer that I made did not really taste good, but there are many other recipes in the book, which may or may not be good."
2,Not very practical,"I keep going back to this book with the idea of brewing a batch of pop and get increasingly frustrated with the complexity of the recipes. Similar to a gourmet cook book....ounces of this...inches of that...vanilla bean, cinnamon bark, sassafras root...yeah, let me go pick a bean and strip some bark. Pretty muck worthless....a real buzz kill. As someone else mentioned, sasafrass root is no longer available. I'm still looking for a better book with realistic and practical recipes. Until then it is better to surf the net for recipes."
3,Great if you live on the East Coast!,"An awesome read with tons of information, but nearly useless because I live in California! The book tells all about gathering roots and herbs and twigs for making great drinks, but we don't have sassafras or birch trees here. Some of the ingredients I can buy dried online, but others are simply impossible without a cross-country drive. Fun to read, but very disappointing, I'd like a few recipes for the west coast folks."
4,Good information,"Overall I think the book is great. Decent amount of information on brewing root beer and other beverages and a nice touch of history throughout. My single COMPLAINT on the book is the author's insistence that glass bottles be used. The problem with this is regardless of the thickness and quality of the bottles, they can and do explode. The only thing you are doing by using stronger bottles is allowing the pressure to build even further before it goes off!If you take the advice of using glass bottles you are asking for a mess and dangerous situation. Buy some PET bottles and never have to worry about explosions. Brewing sodas and Root Beer should be fun, not a health hazard."
4,Good if fits your learning style,"Very thorough in covering the field. This second edition is even better than the first one. Chapters are short and focused. Data was updated to the date of publication. However, the format is plain and a little boring to me. I can read through a chapter in short time but retain not much information besides what I already know. I think it is the dry format design that is not exciting. It is a condensed volume with a lot of good information with no illustration. It should be good for those who prefer this style of reading. It is 6 year old so needs some update, particularly in neuroscience and psychopharmacology."
4,not enough,"Pros: You can use it as a broad guideline to prepare for Part I/PRITE but it has to be supplanted by the synopsis or other texts. Solid info on major DSM d/o, psychopathology, psychopharm, CL psychiatry, special populations, health-care delivery, risk issues and neurology.Cons: The questions are too basic and short-stemmed and do not reflect the complexity of the board questions. Your old PRITE papers will be more helpful for the practice. Some of the figures are questionable and do not tally w/ the major texts. Child and social sciences sections are inadequate and too sketchy. Psychotx sections inadequate and ill-organized for review."
3,This book has lots of informaiton in it...,... but I have never managed to find any information in it to help me deal with a psychiatric issue in a medically ill patient. I'll keep looking.
5,Just what you need,"MGH Update and Board Preparation has all the elements of a good review book: easy to read, full of information, and organized. It even highlights the important stuffs to remember. Overall, this is a great reviewer."
1,Misrepresentation of Book and Poor Customer Service,"This seller misrepresented his book. It was in poor quality and also torn due to mailing in a regular thin envelope. Due to the weight of the book, it damaged the cover.I am still waiting for the refund on the book after mailing it back on June 29, 2010 and today is July 19, 2010. He sent me back the $5.00 shipping charge but not the cost of the book.I do not recommend this seller to anyone. This is the worst experience that I have had with an Amazon book seller."
5,Norpro Ceramic Butter Warmers,"Had an immediate need for a holiday family seafood feast. Already had one pair. Needed 4 more. Very convenient especially with the handles that are touchable well into a prolonged meal. Butter melts in a matter of two minutes and stays soft for literally hours on a single candle. My niece ground up some fresh garlic and included in half of the warmers for optional additional flavor. Very easy to clean afterwards. Safe, attractive, classy. Don't have to worry about tarnishing that may occur with metal sets. And, even though we paid a bundle for the quick delivery, it was well worth it. Now we're set for all future family fun gatherings. Aloha!"
4,"CRAB FEED, YES!","This is a GREAT VALUE! and works great! Small, but ample size, leaves room on the table for other things."
2,"fragile, cheap, stick","it's fragile. One of them delivered broken, and the other one broke while being used.looks cheap.things stick on the bottom. not easy to wash it off."
1,Go Team Bush,"This is the guy who brought us the fawning page-turner, Team Bush. No research in here, no grounding in reality, mostly recycling of past work. He's written this book, what?, ten or twelve times over the past two decades. Enough already."
2,Disappointing,"I admit I watched Open Cam because of its similarities to my novel, IM, which is also about a serial killer using gay internet hookup sites, but I was relieved to see the two stories are vastly different, although they do have the same basis. Relieved, I moved on, hoping for what the description sounded like would be a good gay thriller. Unfortunately, the storyline, which was pretty simple, didn't build the needed suspense very well for a film in this genre. The movie seemed more of an excuse for some admittedly hot scenes; however these scenes did little to advance the thin plot. The acting itself was mostly amateurish and this deficiency was distracting enough to remove me from the world the filmmakers tried to create."
4,"Actually, i really liked it","It was entertaining.....I seriously never expect Oscar worthy performances for a gay movie....not yet at least. However, felt the story was gripping, a nice night at home, nice eye candy, not terribly acted....the detective alone is worth the purchase price.....if you want some light, mindless fare, get this"
4,A Solid Gay Thriller,"A young (and very cute, frequently shirtless (or more)) aspiring artist in D.C. seems to be the center of a murder spree when every guy he sleeps with ends up horribly decapitated, sometimes murdered online.By the time he figures this out, it has become clear that it's someone close to him, but who and why. So, a suitably gay cop (moves in (and then some)) to lure out the perp. This film is done well overall and hangs together sufficiently to keep your attention.I question a few of the improbable turns of events, and there are a few extra characters that don't really seem to matter or add anything, but these are minor flaws in a generally good film. That this film goes well beyond an ""R"" rating could be a plus or a minus, depending on how you look at it. (I had no problem with it!) Might be a bit much for polite company, but certainly good for a quiet evening and worth checking out."
1,no more MAC support!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Do not buy this mouse if you are running Leopard osx, I have been told by tech support they will NOT be updating drivers (since 2006).Too bad, I loved this mouse.... solid construction. Driver was fine until Leopard came out.also there were issues with vista."
1,Buyer Beware,"The RAM works great if you only want 512mb total. The sticks are labeled 512, but are in fact only 256mb. Since they are sold as a kit they can label each as 512, but that is not what they actually are. Contacted ZZ and they told me it was not their problem and to take it up with Kingston. Great customer service, DB's."
5,Love this product!,"My fiance bought this as a gift for me over 2 years ago. I have gotten so much use from it and all my friends love it. I never have a problem with it not getting whine cool enough. It is the same concept as putting wine in ice water, but this device vibrates which makes the cold action quicker. I have used it on numerous occasions when we've had guests over and need more cold wine quick. We recently received a new wine chiller that allows you to set the type of wine to chill. We thought it would be an upgrade and ended up returning the new one b/c it takes at least 35 minutes to chill a bottle of white. That is way too long when the Breville (while maybe not as precise as the newer one) can chill the wine in 15 max. I don't care if my wine's off by 5 degrees. I love the Breville and have recommended it to many friends. Cheers :)"
1,Does not work well to chill wine quickly,The description does not tell you that you still have to add water to unit in addition to the gel packs. I chilled my chardonnay for seven minutes and it was still warm. I had to chill it for 20 minutes to get it cold enough to drink. Gel packs don't allow you to chill several bottles without having to refreeze them or add ice to the machine.
5,Great Product,"This product works very well. Not limited to wine alone, works well with the large specialty beer bottles and also soda. Would reccommend."
1,Failed to do much,This product didn't do anything more than sticking the bottle in the fridge would have done. We've returned it to the seller and hope to get our money back.
5,A must read for anyone who loves poetry...,"Verner Mitchell's book is long overdue. Helene Johnson was a brilliant, up and coming poet of the Harlem Renaissance when she left the poetry circuit to make a living. Langston Hughes, among others, praised her poetry. Mitchell's book gives us previously unpublished poetry as well as further insight into her life. I highly recommend this book to one and all."
3,Okay book,"I purchased this to get information on a Gilligan's Island party we were attending. Unfortunately, the party was a flop as it was held at a bar and no one really organized any fun activities."
1,Sherwood Schwartz is an idiot,"My father was the late Charles Tannen, who, with Bill Davenport, wrote many of the Gilligan episodes.I'm stunned of the strange and cruel things Schwartz and penned about the both of them. My father wasn't difficult, in fact, he was well loved. And, tried very hard to get Bill into AA where he could sober up.I'm sorry you thought so little of my father. You really are clueless.Oh, your ""golden boy,"" Bill Davenport, took a gun to his head on Wilshire Blvd. in the late 80's, and killed himself.I have no clue as to where you got your odd information.Try to show some class. God knows you never have in the past.Charles Tannen's daughter, Tracy."
4,Enter the Enchanted,"Enter the Enchanted by K.A. Applegate, is about a group of kids who get sucked into another world, a world of magic. The main characters are April, David, Jalil, Chris, and Senna. In this book they are trying to escape a crazy god, named Loki.The only character I could relate to is David. I could relate to him because he likes a girl named Senna and she puts a spell on him to do what she wants. I could relate because whan I see a hot girl, even if I don't want to do something, I'll do it.I liked the book. It was great. My favorite part was whan they were in the castle and Sir Galahad fought the god, Loki. I didn't even think any of it was boring.I highly recommend this book and the whole series. They are all action packed, not one boring moment! Any person, who likes fantasy and action would love this book. (12 and up)."
3,Dragons and merlin and knights o my,This book was ok but really isnt as good as the others in the seriesmaybe it is just meIt still held my attension an it was worthwile to read
4,This book is great. Senna is favorite character.,"The book is so breath taking. Senna is so mysterious and so strange, it's what makes her great to read about. And Christopher is funny. Katherine is obviously talented. She is going to be tough competition to beat."
4,A fun and exciting fantasy. Again,"I couldnt ask for much more to this book. It was exciting,funny,scary, and mysterious all rolled into 1 book. In it you can read about the 4 teens who try to get out of a fantasy land full of dragons,knights,merlin,and many more creatures that make this book exciting and interesting. Along with them is a witch named Senna that eveyone wants 2 use. See what happens next and read this book."
3,"stop talking, please","I'll see pretty much anything Emily Blunt is in. I just find her an very cool actress, but that doesn't help this movie all that much. It's a non-stop chick flick talkfest. Basically, I found the other two actors just there. Mr. Doughboy is a complete lump and Blunt's sister in the flick is far from the lesbian hottie she is supposed to be portraying.I won't even get into the story as it's so beyond preposterous that it must have been dreamed up by Hollywood writers who have no idea how real people would react to the things that come up. Of course, everyone forgives and forgets within the time frame of the movie, and we get a happy ending. All well and good but still I found the whole thing just plain dumb.There are no extras on the DVD so...watch it on demand, if you're into implausible emo angsty chick flicks."
2,not great,"I was kind of surprised that this movie was highly rated. I thought it was bad. The acting was good but the plot was ridiculous and all I could think the entire movie was, 'why did Emily Blunt do this film?' It was boring and the plot was really stupid and the end was one of those - is she or isn't she- which I find obnoxious."
2,Disappointing,"I find Emily Blunt very believable as an actress, but can't say as much for the leading actor in this movie, nor for the movie's story line."
3,Movie theme was so-so.,Story about a restless guy trying to find out what really matters to him given the social dilemma in which he becomes involved.What relationships may stand the stress of certain actions. It also includes the time worn story of man's wandering penis.
4,rabbitowner,"Interesting story about relationships with a unique touch. My husband & I both enjoyed the film. Good story with drama, comedy & a little romance."
3,soso,This was a very low budget movie. I thought it would be a lot better than it was. I did not like the ending
3,Cute Movie,Like the shots of the Northwest the best but overall a good film. I give it 3 stars out of 5.
3,"Nice movie, great actors","I enjoyed the movie, and would recommend. It is well written, well acted, and touches quite a few sensitive topics."
4,I enjoyed this movie,I enjoyed this movie... it has a very differnt plot!! I wish it had more of an ending.. it left me wanting more of an ending..
4,Really touching,Great pure acting without the assistance of background music to cue you in to how you are supposed to feel...
3,"Weak plot, great acting","There's not much of a story here, really just the fleshing out of the relationships between the three central (and really only) characters. Essentially the movie is just a vehicle for some wonderful acting, particularly by Rosemarie Dewitt and also by Duplass and Blunt. The dialogue seems to flow naturally, which I imagine is a result of some good writing but more from the actors' skill. The movie as a whole probably deserves more of a 2, but I was glad I watched for the acting. That said, that's the only reason I would recommend watching this. One again, you won't get much of a story."
2,Unrealistic female wish fulfillment.,"From a female perspective, wouldn't it be great if you could sleep with your sister's best friend, who your sister is in love with, trick him into getting you pregnant, but then get forgiven and everyone live happily ever after? And why wouldn't you get forgiven; after all, you took these actions because you were upset, and really wanted something, and you cried a bit - doesn't that entitle you to absolution for whatever you do?A pointless tangent regarding a dead brother and a cliche mystery ending also offend. I gave this two stars because the dialogue was often well-written."
1,your sisters sister,it was ok there were a lot of glitches and the ending could have been better. would not recommend this film.
1,Worse than garbage,"This movie is all you'd expect of a work that exhibits no writing, no thinking, no direction, no acting, no characters, no purpose, no dialog, no cinematography and no talent. I continue to be dumbfounded at what gets financed, produced and released."
1,Not at all interested,It was way to much repetition!! I guess this is just not at all what it looked like it would be in the preview.
2,Better than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick,"story line was good, i love emily blunt......i found the lead man to be rather.....lacking. again, better than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick."
3,Cute Film,"If you like romantic comedies, you may like this film. It is simplistic, but it made me smile. Great film? No. Gentle and humane, yes."
3,Not what I expected,This has a twisted story line that you don't expect. The story is for a open person that can accept things that are outside the norm. It gives you an opportunity to see how half-sister are bonded and can accept each other as family.
5,"Hilarious film, with wonderful dramatic irony","Laughed heartily many times. Squirmed uncomfortably several times. Teared up a little, too. After a fantastic opening, and great middle section, the run up to the ending was a little slow, but a terrific ending left me very happy.I'd recommend this to lovers of romantic comedies."
4,Underrated Gem,"This is one of those movies I rented from Netflix, then put off watching for as long as possible. Finally, there was nothing left to watch, and I popped it in. How wrong I was! This is a delightful little romantic comedy with, essentially, three characters. It revolves around Jack, who's brother recently died; his friend Iris, who sends him to her parents' cabin to get some alone time; and Iris's sister, who happens to be at the cabin when Jack arrives. To say any more would give a lot of the plot away, which is very simple, but still a lot of fun. It's really the acting in this movie that makes it so endearing, particularly Mark Duplass and Emily Blunt, who play Jack and Iris, respectively. Fun and lighthearted with a few dramatic moments, this is a breezy, fun romantic comedy with refreshing character depth."
3,Your Sister's Sister,it's an okay movie; did not keep my attention as I had expected; not sure if I would recommend but not a bad movie
2,Very Shallow,"The best thing here is Emily Blunt. She's brings a bit of life to the proceedings. Otherwise, this is a total waste of time. I've seen a couple of this writer-director's films now. She seems to have a knack for taking interesting plot ideas and destroying them with muddled scripts and shallow, unbelievable characters. This movie goes nowhere. Mark Duplass and his brother make more interesting films but he should stay behind the camera. Wow, is he an annoying actor! This is the kind of indie film that gives indie films a bad name."
2,The preview was the best part,"I was excited about the plot for this movie and thought it would have a good balance of love and family relationships. Unfortunately, the acting felt forced and pretty unnatural."
3,"Quirky, and worthwhile.","i have loved emily blunt since ""the devil wears proda"". this is kind of an artsy film that doesn't move real fast but is worth watching."
3,Dopey Duplass,"A reasonably well-acted chick flick, but forgettable and sometimes embarrassing, with trivial themes (until the end) and a dopey, unappealing lead by Mark Duplass. Seems unlikely that two such well-educated, attractive sisters would even listen to this ninny for more than five seconds, let alone fall in love with him and bed him. Ah, but in Hollywoodland, sexy lead girls are always sweet and sincere."
3,Fun,This movie was a fairly well done look at the transformation of three people finding themselves in a very challenging set of possible outcomes.
3,Boring,Not one of Emily Blunt's best movies. Rather boring plot that has very little impactful dialogue. Gorgeous scenery though that highlights islands off of Seattle. Not enough though to justify 1.5 hr movie.
4,great movie,"this movie was funny and unexpected. I really liked it but hated that the ending left the story hanging (this was done intentionally, however I personally don't like these endings, so my personal preference doesn't effect the quality of the movie)."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in the story line of this movie. The acting was fine, but without being a spoiler, I can only say, the storyline was unrealistic, and twisted. I don't recommend it."
2,I turned it off in 15 minutes!,Boring. although I love Emily Blunt (do see Salmon Fishing in the Yemen with Emily Blunt - absolutely delightful). Just my humble opinion.
2,Slow and boring,"It's an ok movie but, I don't care to watch it ever again...not even if I get bored. The movie was slow from begining to end. The story line had some intrest but the content flopped."
3,The movie was okay,"I don't like telling too much of the story in any of my reviews, because who likes a spoiler. I have to say I thought the movie was good. If you enjoy indie flicks, then you might enjoy this one. I wouldn't watch it over and over again, but I didn't regret renting it. I, however, get annoyed with movies that end on a note where I think.... seriously? I will not explain that, for as I mention I do not like to tell the story. I also found some of the story unbelievable and not in a good way. If your in a mood for a indie love story flick with no action, then you might enjoy this one."
4,Polyamory Exploration,This was a great polyamory exploration. I don't understand the title- shouldn't it read: My brother's lover's sister. Loved the ending.
2,Ahhh... Mark DuPlass,"He's an acquired taste, I guess. I love him on ""The League"" - but even there, he doesn't exactly jibe as a football loving Chicagoan. The movie and the methodology just never click for me, lightly recommend for some well-written dialogue and Emily Blunt - but only in a pinch."
4,Good movie,"This movie was a little different than most, but in a good way. The story and characters are very intriguing."
3,Kind of a bummer,"I thought this movie was a relatively great movie with up to par acting, but the end of the film soon came... Cuts you off like you are a cheap prostitute. That was kind of a bummer."
2,Brought Down by a Convoluted Love Triangle and Plot,"While the trailer makes it look like a quirky, independent romantic comedy, 'Your Sister's Sister' is undone by two plot twists that add unnecessary complexity to the story. I give Lynn Shelton some credit for trying to put a new spin on the genre, but her efforts to create a non-traditional love triangle resulted in the characters doing things that didn't feel natural to their personalities. It's a shame since I am a big fan of Mark Duplass and Emily Blunt, but this really didn't work for me."
4,I love Emily Blunt,"If she's in it, I'll watch it. I totally have a giant girl-crush on her and her british accent. See it!"
4,"Good story line with a twist, pleasant diversion for a rainy night","A nice relationship movie with a bit of a twist. Not high dramatic art, and not my new favorite movie, but worth the rental price. I watched this on a rainy night here in the northwest without my guy, because it was not that high on his list of movies to see. It provided pleasant entertainment during this holiday season when so many things on television are seasonal repeats. I enjoyed the acting, particularly Emily Blunt, who was very likeable, and the northwest setting was beautiful in the outside shots. I felt the last scene was unnecessary and detracted from the film, but for some reason the director must have thought it added something."
3,Nice movie if you have nothing else to do,Good way to waste an hour and a half. The ending was disappointing and the entire movie had no depth.
3,An indie rom-com with low budget John Krasinski...,"I always think Mark Duplass is the indie rom/com version of Jim Halpert. I think he is funny, but his movies and tv performances make my feel funny. Like he's not acting and just playing himself. I feel it while watching the League & also Safety Not Guaranteed (SNG)... (I didn't get the feely from his performance in Zero Dark Thirty). I think many movies that are character development pieces today fall victim to the ""feels like real people"" chatting. I kinda like the movie but won't watch it again.If you loved SNG then you'll love this movie."
1,How many cuss words do you need to tell a story??!,Because of all of the f bombs I turned it off. When did movie writers begin to lack so much in talent that they needed to rely on cussing so much? What a turn off.
1,So bad I asked for a refund,"If there was a message, I missed it. I couldn't hear what they were saying because the foul language dominated the dialogue, besides it was boring."
1,"Bad service.. Bought the HD version, quality was worse than SD","Bad service.. Bought the HD version, quality was worse than SD. I should be reimbursed the money I paid - Nick"
2,Movie,"I should have been more attentive and asked before buying. I expected to get a rental DVD like Netflix, but it was only to be used on a computer, so we did not even get to see it. This was my fault, but I think this should have been explained better"
3,SORT OF FUNNY . . .,"ABRUPT AND UNFULLFILLING ENDING. OTHERWISE ITS A PLEASANT ROM-COM WITHOUT MUCH CHARGE OR EDGE. MAYBE A GOOD, OR TASTEFUL SEX SCENE WOULD'VE HELPED."
4,Having fun learning,"Learning Resources Mar de Silabas- Un juego de construccion de palabras Sea of syllables- A word building gameI teach high school Spanish. I use this game (among others) with my students on periodic ""game days."" High schoolers LOVE to play games, especially ones that look like ""kid games."" This is a super game for beginning and intermediate Spanish learners. I let them use a dictionary to search for new words too. This game reinforces old vocabulary and teaches new vocabulary."
3,This was a gift,"I ordered this book on behalf of someone else, so I cannot review it personally. However, the person who had me order seemed please with it."
3,No inside pockets,"I bought this bag because of its excellent reviews, and it does appear to be well made, however I am sending it back because it lacks inside pockets for wrenches, etc. It has little mesh loops to hold tools against the inside wall, but these are insufficient for my needs--seems like the tools would slip out and end up in a jumble with everything else in the middle. Since the inside is not visible in the picture, I based my purchase on the reviews that praised the bag for it's ample storage. Of course the storage capacity depends on your individual needs, but I would say it has average, not exceptionally well organized storage pockets."
4,Where's the packaging???,"Purchased these cocktail picks as part of a gift I'll be sending to a couple who like to entertain. The picks are as described in Amazon product description-----except they arrived in a white plastic shipping bag and are not packaged in a box or other container suitable for gift-giving. The picks will work nicely with olives, cheese cubes, and fruits at cocktail hour. The absence of a container to hold the barbecue skewers probably explains why they were so inexpensive."
5,Worked out very well,Very easy to work with. I used them with fruit andthe kids loved the idea. Good product would buy themagain.
3,Common sense solutions,"This is a book with basic information for people who really never had any prior experience with textiles. If you are a collector, you probably already know all of the suggestions that are in this book. I didn't learn anything new, and I am not a conservator.Just getting into collecting textiles? Then this book would be for you, it offers helpful cleaning, preservation and storage tips. It's a quick read. Those looking for new ideas for removing specific stains, this isn't the book you need.For the beginner this book will be helpful, but if you have been removing stains from textiles with at least some success, and you know how to store them, this book is not for you."
2,"Martha""s Vinyard Diet Book","This book is most definitely not what I expected. The `diet' outlined here is not for everyone and even carries a disclaimer since people can, and have, died after finishing it. It is not just a watch-what-you-eat and exercise regime, it also entails various kinds of enemas, colon therapy, expensive spa treatments and very strict guidelines for ending the detox. You couldn't pay me enough to attempt everything outlined in this book, but there are some very good take-aways that anyone can benefit from. I'm referring to the guidelines for juicing and the herbs used to cure issues in various organs, cleansing drinks and how to detoxify from the outside in, not just the inside out.I've tried a lot of diets over the years and have come to the conclusion that no matter how much you have to lose, the best, and healthiest, way to lose weight is to consume fewer calories and exercise regularly. Know what your body needs then; eat to live, don't live to eat."
4,I think it is a great book for anyone interested in health & detoxing,"Well, I was looking for a detox and I read the reviews on many books. This one seemed to have great results.I am on day 4 and I have already lost 8 pounds! Crazy! I think that eating lots of veggies and taking a breakon processed foods is a great way to restart a healthy eating lifestyle. I have reflected on what I have beeneating and how I am feeling. No doubt our American diet is overprocessed and nutrient lacking.I created a blog on the experience if you want to check it out! http://marthas21poundsin21daysdiet.blogspot.com/I think the book has lots of good information. I read it quickly. I liked the success stories throughout the book.I like the plan. It is easy and straight forward. This is a detox. You can pick the length on time you want togo on it. Overall, the concepts (colonics, toxins, detoxing) were new to me but I really think they strike a cord withme."
3,"A long detox, but full of information","I read this book over a weekend and did incorporate a lot of its principles into my daily eating. I also learned a lot about juicing, nutrients, the importance of water, and the detox process in general. The title is an eye catcher but not the thrust of the book. I really liked the content more than the title, which is a tad misleading."
1,Rip-off,The book offers no assistance -- there are confusing websites with the similar names -- and there is no support or clarification available. Of course if you eat very little you will lose weight. But it can be done with alot more clarification and support. Save your money. The glowing reviews of this book must have been written by their friends.
5,21 pounds in 21 days Vineyard Diet Detox,This book is an excellent source for detoxification. The instructions were easy to follow and adhere to. After 5 days I had more energy and felt good inside and out.
1,What was she thinking!,There's no way anyone with a 9-5 could do this without getting dizzy and passing out. This is completely unreasonable fast or detox plan unless you go to the facility to be monitored 24/7.If looking into this please pass and do weight watchers or something less drastic.
1,Very poor,This book offers no practical information on how to do the diet. I consider it a waste of my money.
5,Just stick with it.,"I think this is a good book. The problem with this book and all the other books on the subjest, is that people buy them and then do not use them. This book is so easy to follow and it has worlds of benefits to the ones that use it and sticks with it."
3,need to revamp my life.,most of the steps require a complete overdo to my food pantry and to my fitness regimen but it is a total cleanse its to be expected.
1,21 pounds in 21 days,Absolutely the most ridulous book I have ever owned. Cannot wait to get rid of it.
3,"Great stuff, but unfortunately it's old news..","Detoxifying the body is crucial to a healthy body, and juice/tea fasting/veggie-fruit fasting have been around forever! A little research, and you do not have to spend any money on books or clinics to rid your bod of toxins. But I do love reading everything about nutrition so the more the better."
3,Very Extreme,"I bought this book caring less about the detox, more about the potential weight loss. Obviously, the title is an excellent marketing idea.Five days into this diet I quit; its essentially a liquid diet thats low calorie and low protein. Supplies are quite expensive too!!! I did not do the enemas nor did I plan to. Stick to Weight Watchers and exercise. You will regain this weight quickly as soon as you start eating again, even if its a calorie restricted diet."
4,Seems promising,got this over the holidays. read through it and it seems promising. doing the maple syrup cleanse first then if i need to will try this. even though i havn't personally tried it i enjoyed reading it.
2,Good but not so good,"I waited to wrtie my review and I'm glad I did. I did this diet for 10 days and lost 12 lbs. I was thrilled but not for long. I have never desired a colonic and still don't but 8 days into the diet I was very ""backed up"" for about a week--it made me really nervous so I stopped. The general concepts are great but very basic--cut out sugar, bread--eat veggies, supplements and lots of water but not eating--just drinking veg and fruit juices is potentially dangerous to your system. In the end I gained all the weight back and then some! Back to the gym! :("
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this book after seeing a recipe for the vegetable soup in a local newspaper. I am not trying to lose this much weight this quick, but figured that if I used some recipes from the book a few times a week, I would be healthier. After recieving the book, I was very disapointed in the recipes. There were only a few that I would consider using (one of which I had for free from the newspaper.) Most were drinks. I recently purchased a juicer that accomplishes the same thing, but is easier and better. Unless you're willing to not eat solid food for the 21 days, I would not consider this book. Wish I had my money back."
5,Great Book,"21 Pounds in 21 Days gives a wealth of information useful for health as well as weight loss. I was never able to get the recommended daily requirements of fruits and vegetables from meals. Using the juicing technique,or sometimes using only the blender, we consume many more fruits and vegetables in delicious, refreshing drinks. I have enjoyed the experience, and plan to continue this method for a better lifestyle."
1,BE CAREFUL! FOLLOWING THIS BOOK'S ADVICE CAN CAUSE AN ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE & WORSE!,"I bought this book in August, and launched into the 21-day detox believing it would change my life, as Robin Quivers implied it would do on the Larry King Show. I followed it to a ""T."" Since going off, not only have gained all the weight back where there used to be muscle, but I have developed cardiac arrhythmia due to an electrolyte imbalance. Electrolytes such as Potassium and Sodium were completely depleted during the detox through the use of distilled water, enemas, colonics and total lack of nutrition. Such amino acids regulate many things, including heartbeat. I urge anyone who is contemplating this detox to reconsider. It's a load of bull written by a ""quack"" that could make you very sick."
3,hard to follow,"There Way easier ways to detox and get healthy. While it does provide good information, in my opinion (and research), you don't need enzymes and colonics. I would do a colonic after a couple of months. Just make your own juice... its super easy... and you can lose weight and boost your immune system at the same time."
1,don't waste your $$,"this book sucks - what a bunch of pontificating nonsense - tangent of words saying the same thing over & over - instead of being clear & concise, & wait for it 'a coffee enema' - one of THE MOST TOXIC HORRIBLE THINGS TO DO TO YOUR COLON - Hello anyone talk to a CCT (Certified Colon Therapist) - what a joke"
1,Give my butt a break,This book is just another way for the author to make some money. Funny how in the promo by Robin Givens that she never mentioned all the colonics one needs to do. No thank you and they are very dangerous. People should stay away from them. This diet is only for the rich who can afford to go to Martha's Vineyard and be locked in a room for 21 days while people wait on you hand and foot. I want my money back.
3,I wanted more drink recipes,"Overall, I thought the book was extensive in explaining the benefits of juicing, and it gave good step by step instructions and suggestions on how to gradually get back into a regular eating plan after following the juice plan for a certain amount of days.But, I was looking for more recipes and combinations of fruits and vegetables. There were recipes for dressings and soups, but only a few suggestions for how to actually put together your day to day juicing plan.Overall the suggestion I got from the book was to put together any fruit or vegetable drinks and then consume every two hours. I could have learned all that on my own."
3,Not impossible to do,"If you're not a millionaire, you can improvise a bit, and do most of the diet plan, on your own, with little expense. Do the coffee enemas yourself... do some research, and get some vitamins/supplements that help your metabalism, and also a multi vitamin daily, just in case. Fruits and vegetables are the key. The author was on the Howard Stern radio show for a week, because Robin Quivers is a client of hers. She never once even mentioned her website the entire week. She didn't strike me as only out to make a quick buck. She seems sincere and knowledgable and cautious."
1,completely unrealistic -- for me at least,"I have no doubt that this program would be effective. However, after reading the book cover to cover I realized that the only way I could follow the program would be to go to the Martha's Vineyard and I can't afford that. I think the ""home"" program is completely unrealistic for the average person.I agree with the reviewer who said ""Too much preparation and costly purchases."" I just know myself well enough to know I would not spend that much time and effort every day preparing for this ""diet"" and I can't afford the weekly colonics. . . even if there were a place to get them in my area which there isn't.When I hit the Lottery maybe I'll treat myself to three weeks at Dr. Roni's place but that's the only way I'd ever do the program and then I'd think long and hard first."
3,Impossible to do -- I'd rather not eat,"While I enjoyed reading the book and I agree with the author's philosophy, I found the juicing and the green drinks so disgusting that I actually didn't eat for a whole day. I lasted 4 days on this diet and wasn't hungry, but even the mushy soup for dinner was so unappetizing that I knew I couldn't last seven days, let alone 21. If you don't mind drinking vegetable juice, you can probably reap the benefits of the detox. But I still feel like throwing up every time I look at the cover of the book."
1,Totally misrepresented...,"This fasting program probably works fine if you have the time and money for spa treatments, high colonics and are into enemas. I will be reselling my copy of this book to someone who does! There are some good pointers on juicing your fruits and vegetables, but that is only a small part of this plan."
1,this book is a waste,"Don't waste your time. It is just a big sales and marketing pull to the website which then wants you to buy product. There is no concrete ""fasting"" plan at all and there is a very heavy emphasis on religion so you should know that if that makes you uncomfortable. Again this book should lay exactly a plan to do the fast but it does not."
1,Not realistic.,"This book could have been written in a more organized manner. Also, the diet is better as a weekend detox, than a three-week diet as most of the people who do it for three weeks feel weak and dizzy. The author claims they feel weak and dizzy because of past issues; I doubt that. Most people feel week and dizzy from NOT EATING. I don't think people that have to work will be feeling well and there might be some sick days used up from this nutty diet."
2,"Irresponsible, Unsustainable, and Dangerous","Of course you'll lose weight if you follow this plan. You're eating about 500 calories a day, and that's if you gorge on soup.""Dr."" Roni advises people to eat no protein and no fat for 21 days, plus consume dangerously high levels of Vitamins A and K. This is DANGEROUS.The weight you lose will go right back once you start eating 2000 calories a day, like most humans are supposed to.Is this why you're supposed to do this once a year--to take off the weight again? Gaining and losing 20 lbs a year is terrible for your body, especially your skin. It will cause wrinkles and loosen the elasticity of your skin.I gave it two stars instead of one because some of the tea recipes are useful."
2,Poorly Written,"This is a good primer guide for juicing but there are better ones out there. The book is so poorly written and edited that one would think the book was self published. Here is some dieting advice; eat less, move more. Save your money from the purchase of this book. I wish I had."
2,Hard to follow,"I found this diet diffiult to follow as it it too strict and too limited. I found another book, ""The Liver Cleansing Diet"" by Dr Sandra Cabot much easier to follow as it has many choices for each meal. Dr Cabot explains that if you follow this diet you will bring your metabolism into balance and that will bring your weight into correct alignment. I was not feeling well when I decided to follow this diet and within a day I was feeling much better."
2,Good & Bad,"My husband and I made it 15 days! It was a good education in what real food is.It is way too radical. (Need to go to the retreat center.)If you want to do it, I would recomend the weekend or the 5 day options.Also, many typos and some missing information in the book. Very frustrating when your trying to get going on the diet."
1,"""dr"" roni isnt even a doctor","i wish i could give this 0 stars. dr. roni isnt even a real doctor, her ""medical degree"" was received from an online NON-accredited university. the AMA doesnt recognize it. she became a dr in less then 6 months....amazing.as for the book it is full of unhealthy advice and purports 0 scientific evidence. you lose weight because you are malnurished. colonics and enemas are harmful because they rid the body of ""good"" bacteria that have a symbiotic relationship with mammals. no doctor would recommend this as a common activity. also heavy metals and other toxins can not be excreted through the skin, it is a physical impossibility. she is a quack plain and simple."
5,Great Results,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend and I'm so glad that I did. I was not a big believer in detox but read this book and followed its shorter term program. I have lost 15 pounds the first 2 weeks on it. Dr. DeLuz includes some delicious recipes and great tips to ensure that you can lose weight without always being hungry. Besides losing weight, I find that I have geater mental clarity, memory, and focus and less joint pain. I recommend."
1,Needs an Editor,"This book needed an editor and a Martha Stewart. It is all over the place and it is padded with testimonials but does not contain a single juice recipe! It dictates juice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner but not a single juice recipe!? I didn't buy it to have to buy another book or $200 of DeLuz's products so I could follow the plan! Honestly, what a rip-off! Great on medical generalizations, but short on facts. I am so unimpressed!"
1,21 lbs lost,I was disappointed in the book. It did not contain what I thought it would. I would not recommend it.
1,Enemas and starvation,"This book's entire point is to stop eating anything except fruit and vegetables, and to have regular enemas and colonics in order to lose weight and live longer.Thank you for the obvious (fruit and vegetable) advice, and the unpleasant [and crazy] (enemas and colonics) advice."
1,Revolting and Dangerous Cash in,"Okay folks, I cant understand how these quick cash ins for dollars keep selling. Just a little hint but if you come across any ""diet"" program that mentions losing more then 2.5lb a week it does not have your health or body in mind in the least. I have seen so many folks destroy their gallbladders, health and skin by rapid weightloss that does not give you time to learn problem eating and excerise habits."
1,21 Pounds in 21 days,"The information was incomplete and not consistent with the program as described on Oprah (I think, some talk show). It took my digestive system 6 months to get back to normal functioning even following their instructions. When contacted for information they simply referred me to my physician rather than providing information that would have been helpful. I'm not happy at all with the program but I've learned to LOVE juice."
2,losing weight,"The product is an excellent source, but to expensive to purchase some of the items needed and not sensible...you can get sick from using it and also according to the curriculm you could have withdrawals. I do not like anything that could create more problems than I already have. Misleading it does not tell you you have to do a curriculm to began to eat again until after you buy the book"
1,Waste of Money,I found nothing of value in this book. It is simply a rambling series of claims about nutrition and new age treatments not backed up by a single shred of scientific or medical evidence that I can see. The plan is totally impractical unless you have no problem scheduling weekly colonics and coffee enemas.
1,I would pass on this book..,"I am following this book and losing about 1 pound per day:The UltraSimple Diet: Kick-Start Your Metabolism and Safely Lose Up to 10 Pounds in 7 Days by Mark Hyman.No intrusive procedures, lots of common sense & scientific support, no hunger, lots of flexibility. Hyman's approach is very doable."
1,Unrealistic,"I have no doubt that if one followed all the author's suggestions and bought all her supplements this plan would work. However unless you have a lot of time , (to get colonics and give yourself enemas) as well as money (to buy all the additional products you need to follow the daily menu plan) then I do not think this plan is for you."
1,No response to E-mail,"I would not recommend purchase the products. The cleansing system arrived with no instructions or guide to follow. The cleansing system was over $200.00. I purchased the book and still had questions. I e-mailed Dr. Ronnie requesting specific instruction and to get my questions answered, she nor her staff responded. Steve Harvey promotes the cleanse, I'll bet she responded to him. I wound not recommend this cleans system for that reason. I expect a return response when spending that much money."
4,Very informative,This book opened my eyes and created a healthier way of life for me. I will be starting my first 21 days soon and expect very positive results.
4,If only there were an American version,"That's the only drawback. We have trouble relating to some of these statistics because they're British or generally Eurocentric. On the other hand, all the adjectives on the cover are true. There are many eyebrow-raising facts, of both the pleasant and not-so-pleasant sort, like the humbling kind. Try the percent of people worldwide who have never made a telephone call, or the percent of people in India who have never heard of the USA.This is a great book for anyone. As a math teacher, I leave the numbers blank and ask my students what they think. The only one for which they were generally dead on was the number of Americans who are injured by shopping carts per hour. Makes for some interesting discussion, and definitely some perspective. Could there possibly be an American version in the works? If so, the 5th star for the rating is on its way!"
2,"Not much for the money, and other sources","I bought this book while trying to buy another book called Numbers. When I saw my error, I thought it might be fine as I like these types of numbers. But, at 96 pages, thin, not much per page, I returned it even though I lost money doing it. Pretty weak. The Harper's Index from Harper's Bazaar magazine gives you about as much per issue. And has a book. And is more compelling generally. Not my vote for a great use of money, though a few nice number twists are in here."
1,This movie does not offer Amazon appeal.,"I bought this movie because I find muscular women attractive and exotic. This movie featured a very fit character, named Ravinhawk, but it did not meet my needs.There is only one scene where the beautiful Ravenhawk flexes her muscles, and it's breif. Moreover, her back is turned and it's during the night, so you don't get a very good look at her sexy back.There is no nudity, and the movie is poorly made. The story seems unbelievable, and does not really come full circle. Scenes where she beats up much smaller and weaker men with her bare hands would have made this movie much better.Don't buy this movie if you want to see a lot of female muscles. Sorry guys, it's a let down that way. I recommend Skin Deep for those needs, though that's only a breif scene too, but it's revealing."
2,At Least She Looked Great At 40,"Well, I think just about everyone agrees Rachel McLish had a much better bodybuilding career than an acting one. In this Class B action film, she's the female equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first action movie, ""Conan The Barbarian.""Of course, Arnold made an incredible career out of his acting and has gone on to bigger and better things. This was it for Rachel, acting-wise. Oh, well, at least she was a two-time Ms. Olympia winner.To McLish's credit, she looked good in the film which was made when she was about 40 years of age. How many 40-year-olds do you know are in the shape this woman was here? And, in her defense, the person who wrote the dialog for this film didn't help her out much. The screenplay is really lame. Not many actresses would look good with dialog this dumb.Basically, what we have here is another simple revenge tale, and not one that is well-done. Not recommended."
5,Hospital Grade Multiple Outlet Strip,"This Hospital Grade Multiple Outlet is not your everyday ""extension cord thing.""It is quality made in the United States of a die-stamped/formed housing with mounting tabs on either side ,making it desirable for mounting to a cabinet or rolling cart.This particular one came with a 6'cord(white) but is also availablein lengths up to 15'.The receptacles are rated at 15 amperes @ 120 volts a.c and are recognizable by the green dot on the lower right hand corner,signifying hospital grade.Why hospital grade?Because it is a requirement in surgical and operational clinics nationally.I have purchased these before from other sources but Amazon offered the best price with shipping considerations over a certain dollar amount.I have been using Amazon.com and will continue to do so due to their prompt shipping and ease of billing and tracking system.Thank You Amazon.com and keep up the Great job you have been providing to us all!Tony De Falco"
5,This book gives great new ideas which motivate me.,I found this book much more interesting than the average classroom textbook. It seems to be the best answer I've seen so far in the battle against illiteracy. I believe this book should be required reading for aspiring literacy specialists!!
3,Wasn't what I hoped for,"I picked this book up because I was looking for a way to adjust my language arts classroom. I teach a remediation class and wanted to create a differentiated classroom learning environment for the language arts portion of my class. I was hoping this book would give me insight into how to go about doing so.The book does give a good description of what a teacher who developed a pilot literacy program. I was able to adapt some of her descriptions; however, I hoped for at least some definitions of her blocks. I did not have a full understanding after reading her book. This would be a good supplemental as a case study, but does not really provide a good working model/directions for how to establish a literacy workshop classroom."
5,I think.....,"Just a reminder to those who are planning to buy this book... this book is somewhat like a notebook. I personally like to stick things on it. THIS IS NOT A STORYBOOK MIND YOU! If you like to write, this can be a journal for you or a diary."
5,Potter Rules!!!!!!=^},"I Soooo loved this book. It took me 1 day to finish it, just because It was so good. I couldn't put it down. Read it if you like Harry Potter. Even if you feel kinda out of it because of it's lengthy looks, It really won't take you that long to finish, and you'll end up lovin it in the end. Go Potter!!"
1,rubbish and totally useless,i read lady killer and boy it was amazing. the GRAFT is soooooooooooooooo annoying. moves like a tortoise and there is NOT one saving grace. it is so shabby and none of the characters seem real . half way thru the book and u know nothing more than u did from the first page.total waste of my time.
5,Martina Cole books,I have never read such great books in my life as i have by Martina Cole my loss is Ive read them all and dont know who is eve as good an auther as her I loved these books so much she is precise and to the point and I just adore her
5,Fantasic Mystery Game!,"Clue Fatal Illusion is a wonderful mystifying game full of gorgeous graphics. It does take some time and patience to get through it;however, it is definetly worth it! The new and interesting characters added were a nice change from the typical Clue gang. I found the puzzles challenging and fun. The many short cinematics were great to watch. This game may run slow on older computers but it worked great for me! I highly recommend this one!"
2,It gets two stars just because it was a mystery,"I love mysteries, they are all I like to play. I must say this one was probably the most disapointing one I have played though. I have a brand new maxed out system and still experienced problems, even after the patch. I would hope Hasbro takes a little more time to work out the problems before they release another one. As far as they mystery itself, it was just okay. I went through it pretty quickly, and found the ending to be all of a sudden and somewhat disapointing."
1,What a waste of time! Too Bad,"I couldn't wait to get this game in the mail. When I finally did, it turned into such a headache! The graphics are nice, the mystery really good, but I had to re load it several times before I got a clue as to how it should work. You have to download a ""patch"" from the internet to get it to work properly, which it never did. Not only that, but I found out it's the same game over and over. To quote Hasbro ""20 thrilling hours of gameplay"", ""quick set up"". Don't pay the money for this game, it's not worth it! Sorry to disappoint you, but I was extremely disappointed, too. Hopefully, the next time Hasbro decides to make another Clue CD Rom, maybe they will work out all the kinks first!"
2,Hasbro Clueless on Cusotmer Service,"We recommend not buying this game, unless you don't mind a buggy version that is not supported by Hasbro and can't be fixed. Hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available. Save your money and wait for the next one, hopefully bug free."
2,stuck,"I like the game, but if you become stuck, there is no place to go to get help. If anyone can tell me how to get into the wheel room, please let me know. My email is jbean@mcn.net."
4,"Excellent documentary, a real eye opener of what certain areas of this country are like","Hard to believe there are parts of this country that are against sex education. And though this documentary showed this group of students as involved and caring about this one social issue, it also demonstrated that 'most' of us have our prejudices. It's worth viewing by proponents of either side of this issue."
1,A complete total rip-off...,"I bought the DVD, ""House of Shakira"", live at Firefest 2005, thinking of course, as anyone would think that it was a DVD of the one and only, SHAKIRA. Amazon advertised it with all of the Shakira tapes and DVD's. I had bought two other DVD's and audio CD's and was really satisfied with them. However, don't buy the House of Shakira because it has nothing to do with the real genuine Shakira. All I received for the cheating price that Amazon charged was a bunch of speed freaks screaming their stupid music. I really take the blame for this rip-off DVD. I and you should be aware of all the different ways that Amazon and Caiman.com cheats, probably thousands of customers. Oh, Yes, Of course there's no way that you can contact Amazon or Caiman by phone and get a refund or exchange and of course, they'll never answer your e-mail. Watch your back, because Amazon will stick a knife in it and take your money and won't give you what they represented."
1,dont buy,Ok im a big airsoft player and these sound like a awsome idea and they are a great idea but they are a horrible product. When I bought these i was exited i got home and loaded my gun which by the way shoots 450 fps. Getting them in the clips was a pain. They arnt even round there like a ovel shape. so i finaly get them in the gun after about a half hour. I shot one bb at the side of my house wich is brick and i was about 20 feet away and the bb hit the wall. Did it explode like real paintballs of course not. I have also heard about people having them break in the gun and jam the gun. That didnt happen to me but im shure it could of. Also when you shoot them they only go about 50 fps. so if u like to waste money this is the product for you. Otherwise i would strongly suggest to NOT buy this product.
1,You've seen this one before,"Thank goodness I didn't pay much for this book. I didn't care for it at all. There were only 1-2 ideas I could take from it. I didn't think it was worth it. The ideas seemed very typical, for it to be 2004, it just lacked the innovation I was expecting."
2,Go for the turbo mouse,"If you don't really care about precision don't bother reading. The Turbo Mouse, despite its name, is another kensington trackball. It's not as pretty as the orbit (just gray) but it is far superior to ANY trackball on the market and it has 4 buttons. After having to leave my old Turbo Mouse with a former employer I tried several cheaper substitutes (FYI: Macally products are nearly useless) but ended up spending the loot on the Turbo Mouse. Check it out...take apart your trackball and look at the guts. The ball rests on low friction surfaces right? Look closely now, they may try to fool you. The turbo mouse is the only trackball I've found that rolls on bearings. Smoother than a baby's...uh....frictionless surfaces. Oh... don't even get me started on optical trackballs...have you ever tried to use PhotoShop with an optical trackball? It's like painting with mud. But if you just use Word and EMail ignore me...don"
5,Orbit a joy to use.,"The Orbit is easy to install. Very fast and smooth operation. My five year old daughter much prefers it to a mouse for her games and such. Its clicks and speed of movement are entirely adjustable. With a half an inch of finger only movement, your cursor has moved thirteen inches across the screen. It takes two inches of wrist movement to do this with a mouse. The Orbit isn't perfect. It's actually too fast for some games where you need the drag of the mouse for control. Use both. Keep the mouse connected and plug the Orbit into a serial port. Works great!"
5,A Great Product-Simpely the best trackball i have ever used,"i haven't had any of the problems of the other people that have written reviews. Sure it gets durty, but it really isn't that hard to clean. It is a great product and like i said before, i have NOT had any of the problems that the other people have complained of and i've had mine for 3 years. It really deserves a better score than a 2/5. and like i said in the title of this review, it is simpely the best trackball that i have ever used."
2,Pay more for something better!,"I liked the idea of not rolling a mouse around my desk; particularly since i have a laptop and i don't like the track pad at all.The Kensington Orbit was fantastic at first; up and running in seconds, easy to use and feels great in my hand.However, after approx. 3 months use, I find that the left-right action gets stuck very easily and is very hard to start again. Getting the ball out to clean the rollers is easy, but actually cleaning those tiny little rollers is a nightmare, much harder than a normal mouse.Plus, the rubber is so small it is deteriorating really quickly.I discovered the roller itself gets stuck inside the casing and doesn't spring back as it should, so the roller is not touching the ball.In conclusion: you get what you pay for: cheap and nasty!"
1,LG Bul 18x dvdrw,Picture shows Litescribe drive however the two received were not. Also came up as different models in properties. Would not purchase again from this seller.
3,Don't judge a book by it's cover!,"This is an excellent x-men paperback. It explores one of the hottest x-women's orgin, psylocke, and how she came to be abeautiful asian ""action junkie"". There are two things that i did not like. Number one, I don't know who picked out that cover but it had nothing to do with the entire paperback. Another down side to this comic is that after 303 pages they didn't even finish off the ending. Other then that it's worth every penny to purchase this paperback!"
2,Mish mash,"This collection is a microcosm of the X-Men universe: Confusing storylines, dense text, ponderous captions and brilliant art. Don't go looking for a coherent storyline here, this is basically just a showcase for the great Jim Lee's early X-Men work."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Not as cool now as it seemed to be then. Not much doubt that Jim Lee is very influential on an artist and how comic artwork has developed, but when you look back on it you see it is very 90s, and not timeless in the way John Romita Jr. or Paul Smith's work was, so part of the reason for the fall of comics at the time, too."
5,A great X-Men Jim Lee graphic Novel!,"This is a great X-Men: Visionaries Jim Lee graphic Novel! This is Jim Lee's early work on the Uncanny X-Men series! This Marvel Tradepaperback reprints Jim Lee's early years when he was the comic book artist on Uncanny X-Men. In this book reprints Uncanny X-Men#248,#256-258,#268-269, #273-277. His early work on the Uncanny X-Men in the early 1990s, lead to to the critically aclaimed Clarmont/Lee work on X-Men #1 in 1991. All the Uncanny X-Men issues are written by Chris Claremont. Most of the artwork is drawn by Jim Lee. Unncany X-Men#273 is drawn by various artist. Buy this book if your a big fan of X-Men and Jim Lee. Highest Possible Recommendation."
1,Amaazon.Com description is WRONG and does not match SHIPPED,"Purchased this Folkmanis Rabbit in the hat puppet at full price from Noteworthy Goods LLC and also from National Video Tape Co (USA Toys). It was supposed to be a full sized hat at approximately 8 inches wide by 14 inches long according to the description. Both times all I got was the $6 finger puppet, which is about 2 x 3 x 3 inches! This is completely false description!!Somehow Amazon messed up the restock of this and put the finger puppet in the hat puppet bin so what is shipped DOES NOT match the description! There does NOT seem to be a way to order the hat sized puppet at this time. All previous reviews were BEFORE the stock bins were messed up.I still want this puppet, but I do not see ANY way to order it. Do NOT waste your time buying this item!NOTE: This rating is only for my order experience, NOT a rating for the Folkmanis puppets, with which I have had good experience in the past!"
5,The Last Storyteller,Diane Noble is an amazing writer with a gift for drawing the reader into the thoughts and emotions of her characters. Her skill with words make her characters live and breathe. I can't wait for more books from Diane Noble!
1,Not for me,"Not particularly well written right-to-life Christian propaganda, disguised as a novel. I picked this up on a whim - what a mistake."
4,Complex Clues,"As you follow Basil Coventry, an ""information gatherer"" in Elizabethan England, there will be numerous chuckles, several guffaws,and even a belly laugh or two. Basil is more interested in finding the next potable and, somtiimes, not so potable alcoholic drink than he is in gathering information. Basil, stumbles, fumbles, and bungles his way, and you are treated to Ferguson's descriptions in simile and metaphor form. Basil dreams of better things for himself but, just when he thinks he has reached his goal, he drops himself back into his old ways and the chance is lost. This is not always an easy read. The archaic words require the use of ""complex clues "" and , perhaps, a dictionary but it is fun and well worth the read."
2,Cute but not comfortable,"These slingbacks looked cute, although the fit was a little shorter than average. Unfortunately, the stitching on the inside footbed was very prominent and hurtful to walk on. I had to return the shoe."
1,Waste of Money,"The concept behind this product is sound - the opportunity to drive your dog crazy trying to get to the treat inside. And the concept of teaching the animal to press buttons or whatever correctly to get the treat is Pavlov's dream. However, the product just dosn't hold up. Literally. It's a plastic piece of junk that gets chewed up quickly by any larger dog. The one we receive even came prechewed - as if someone had returned it. The ""giggle"" noises were nothing like giggles. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,dangerous!,"My dog did enjoy this toy at first. We had it one week before she got her entire lower jaw stuck inside the opening. We had to take the toy apart to remove it and even doing that she was still bleeding from her mouth. Had we not been home at the time she did this, I don't know what would have happended!"
1,This toy landed our pup at the emergency vet,Our dog literally had to have this toy removed from her jaw with a SAW. I cannot even believe they are still selling it. The part where the treat comes out allowed her to wedge the lower half of her jaw into the toy and she got stuck so badly that it was slicing into her gums. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY. It is TERRIBLE!
4,A Sisters in Spirit BookClub Review,"This was definitely a page turner! This book was packed with excitement and drama. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Richardson touched on issues of racism, abortion, rape and many others faced in our society today. He did a wonderful job creating realistic characters although at times, some of the plot seemed a little too fictional. However the book was so poignant, that I felt as if I were actually amidst all of this chaos. I would definitely offer it as a reading selection for book clubs because the issues presented offer alot to discuss."
3,"An Intriguing tale of racism, hatred","W. James Richardson's Misbegotten is an intriguing story of the lives of two police officers - one African American, the other White - in the city of Detroit. They each learn a lesson in racism when their lives become intertwined in a rape investigation, bombings of three African American churches and several apparent racially motivated murders.Richardson overdoes it with the cursing and use of racial slurs. The fabulous thing about Misbegotten is that the key characters are transformed and covertly the author gets the reader to judge himself and his view of others because of the color of their skin. Despite the editing mishaps, the pace is quick and perplex.Richardson's story has a very unexpected ending that neatly ties all the loose ends. He also sends out a strong message: we should be careful how we treat others, one day that person may be your saving grace or the answer to your prayers."
5,amazing and hillarious show,death valley is the funniest showw on mtv and i cant get enough of it its awesome!!!!!!!!!!! if u r on the edge about buying this just do it funniest show on television period . ya i just actually said period
4,An Aggresive Attitude,"This is a album full of heavy rock sound mixed with a bit of Nu-Metal. This band from Argentina is one of the best on the genre here in latin america. I speak spanish, but I wrote in english, so people around the world will know some of this band. This record is full of heavy reefs and a machinal battery. The bass is present, but not much. The frontman Andrés Jiménez screams, sing and wispers... all this in one album. The A.N.I.M.A.L. name is an avrebiature of the spanish ""Acosados Nuestros Indios Murieron Al Luchar"" (acossed our indians died at fight). Lirics of this album talks about desesperation, the friendship union, the best of the worst, and some times like pain, happiness, is a poem to the life. Great A.N.I.M.A.L."
3,volume is terrible,"Cute little phone, but I've had for 2 months but I don't like it! I have the volume turned as high as will go, but I still don't hear it ring most of the time. I paid for a custom ring tone and can't use it because its even quieter! And no, I am not hard of hearing.Also battery life is terrible! I only use it 5-10 minutes a day, but it goes dead in 3-4 days!I'm looking for a new phone"
4,Good Phone So Far,"I purchased this about a month ago because it was a cheap unlocked phone. I really like it. The only problem I had is that I thought my phone book entries would be transferred when I put in the SIM card - that was not the case. I like the design and quality of the phone and the only drawback is that it does not seem to be able to store more than one phone number per name so I have to make separate entries (i.e., jim cell, jim home, jim work) which is a hassle and makes scrolling down the list of contacts more cumbersome."
2,phone is the pits,"This phone is a really neat phone however there are 2 issues with it. 1) It shuts off on its own all day although there is battery power so you are unable to keep your time and date set as you have to remove and replace the battery for the power to come back on. 2). after a few months the ringer volume even on all is hardly audible so you miss calls all the time, the phone also although on vibrate does not do this either after just a few months. I would not reccomend purchasing this phone, its cheap but you will have to buy another in a short time anyway."
2,Book Too Tiny,"I normally am an advocate of any book or magazine published by Cook's Illustrated magazine. Unfortunately, this series of books are too small and the print too tiny to be practical. You have to hold it very close to your eyes to read it which makes it totally impractical for putting in your cookbook holder to refer to while cooking. Since the pages are so small, the recipes span several pages which isn't great for the cookbook holder either! I find it ironic that the subtitle says "" An illustrated step-by-step guide to perfect potatoes every time."". There are only 8 illustrations in this particular book."
5,Eye Opening and inspiring!,I have been an Eddie Izzard fan for years and have enjoyed his special and intelligent brand of humor. I must say that this DVD took me by surprise. Izzards childhood and subsequent search for an outlet for his creativity is facinating! What a workhorse this man is...what humility....what heart! You have no idea what Eddie has been through until you watch this video...I have become an even greater fan.
5,Great story!,"This is a wonderful bio!!! Even if your not a ""Eddie Izzard"" fan, you will enjoy this! Although he is the funniest man in the world."
3,if you like Eddie Izzard......,"If you like Eddie Izzard you will find this interesting, but most of the material is the same and repeated. My sons (13 & 15)really laugh and roll with Eddie's 'live shows', but were bored with this, it really is a biography and not a comedy show. An adult would find the subtle message of 'not giving up' and 'taking chances'."
4,quite interesting,"I would recommnend this title, there are a lot of pictures, and therefore a bit less written information, but on the whole I think this book is worth buying."
4,Bike Cover,Dose not blow away.. dose the job I wanted it for. Our bikes are stored outside in the elements.
4,"A good, personal book.","You may disagree with Smith, but he was there, and you weren't. :) This book has good personal accounts of Smith's encounters with some Chinese masters of various different martial arts. It is highly recommended, especially for the history involved in such a work. The 1-star deduction is because it isn't in Pinyin, and also beacause it is so thin!"
1,Biased and arrogant!,"Once I finished reading this book, Robert W Smith made a really terrible impression as both an individual, a writer and a martial artist. He writes and communicates in an arrogant and conceted manner. However his book on Baguazhang was a lot better. This book is a waste of money, though you will find out what one American thinks, if that is what you want. His attitudes about chinese martial arts on Taiwan and on China are biased. He just seems to really dislike China."
1,doesnt work well bad charger,i plugged this into my genesis hoping that it would work for it.. unfortunately it doesnt fit! do not buy this item for sega genesis..
1,sent wrong item,"This product was a waste of time. I waited like a week and 1/2 for it to come, then try to test it out and realize they sent me the wrong item. I'll never buy an item like this again from here."
2,Poor Quality......Returned,"The metal used in the locking mechanism is of poor metal quality....the stem is not spring loaded and the metal is thin all around...Locking nut was easy to detach, making it easy to remove the stem, defeating the purpose of the lock. Item returned. Buying cable lock instead"
4,Does what it says,"It locks the front fork down perfectly. I mounted this on a thin plank and put it in my car, now no more falling over when I put my bike in."
3,Bike mount,very nice functioning bike mount. The mounting holes are round..... I wish they were square holes so you can mount it with carriage bolts as another safety. I also bought the other mount by delta with the O-ring in it to keep the arm in place. I like that one a lot better and it's well worth the extra $2 bucks
5,love my bike rack,great rack for the price would recommend to anybody if I ever need another I would buy another one solid
2,too wide for aluminum fork,"very good design but too wide to get my Schwinn Protocol mountain bike fit in, and even scratched my forkreturned"
4,Does what it's supposed to do.,"Nice, cheap. works good!Only problem is unlatching when bike forks are locked in. Not enought room to get fingers in to unlatch it."
4,Does the Job,"The hitch does what it is suppose to. At first it looked kind of flimsy and I thought that my fork will slip out but the fork is locked in pretty tight. In my set up, I mounted the hitch to a 2x6 board which I lay in the truck bed. That way, I can remove the 2x6 and have use of the full bed without somthing sticking out. You will also need some way to secure the back wheel or it will swing around when you take sharp corners in your truck. I got a ratcheting cargo bar which I layed across the top of my back wheel to keep it in place and secured it with a velcro tye.Only complaint I have is that the spacer tab (the tab next to the quick release) sticks and hard to move back and forth. I tried greasing that part and it helped some.I recently looked at the Delta bike hitch pro2 at a bike shop, it costs $10 more but seems lot more sturdy and the mechanism seems to be lot smoother."
4,Good Investment,I purchased two of these bike mounts so that I could get me and my sons MTB's mounted in the back of my pick up. The mechanism isn't the smoothest but it open up wide enough that I don't have to mess around with unscrewing it to get the bikes off. I mounted them onto the toolbox in the back of my truck and that worked great for my sons bike. My bike has the disc brakes so I had to use a piese of dee[ strut to mount to the tool box first to get me the clearance that I needed. If you compare the price to Thule or Yakima you'll realize that you can buy 2 or 3 of these for the same price. So far I think its been a great product.
4,Good instructional DVD,"I thought this dvd was easy to follow and interesting. It was not about sex but more so love and sex. You would not want to do the things they tell you about with a casual partner, someone you just met, or someone you are not that into. It was quite lengthy and some of the material presented may make you feel silly but overall it was good and I would recommend to those with an open mind. I laughed a few times and said to myself ""my husband would not go for that"". It's worth a try."
4,Loved it!,"This movie is very educational and fun. Your idea of fun may be different than mine, but it you are interested in taking your relationship to a new height you should learn tantric sex. It not only heightens your senses and creates a better sexual experience, it also takes your quality of life to a different height. It is something I think everyone should try."
1,Utterly Disappointing,"I bought a stick of this ram a week ago, and I'm returning it. The timing stored in the SPD does not match the datasheet, and manually tuning the timing to those values does not work either. Tech support claims that the datasheet values are for overclocking, but OC is not mentioned anywhere.Kingston is selling CL3 ram at CL2 prices. Don't fall for it."
3,Not what I expected,"I was waiting for this book to become available, and bought it right away. I was disappointed, first of all, at how pathetically small the book is for the price. Also, I was expecting to see some really awesome stuff...new stuff. However many of the photos are of murals I've seen in other books on the subject. (To be clear, I'm not saying these artists' works are bad, it's just I've seen it all before) There were a few new ones, but not incredibly impressive. I guess if you're looking for some books with some stunning work in it, I would go for some of these:Revisiting The Painted House by Graham Rust (as well as his other titles), and The Art of Trompe L'oeil Murals by Yves Lanthier."
3,Overview,"This book is best described as an overview of other books written by the author. With limited ""How To"" I consider the book for ideas rather than teaching."
5,Beautiful Album,Beautiful album. I consider this one of the best spanish-language albums I've ever heard. It's luxuriously jazzy music and lyrics have a wonderfully sensuous sound!
5,JESTER ROCKS!,"This CD, just like their debut CD ""Tales from the Boogieman""..if you can find it......Rocks! I am a big fan of 80's Metal, and after seeing this band at The Birch Hill and The Wreckroom in NJ.......I had to get the CD's. These guys are preserving the music what is almost extinct now a days in music, and they deserve credit . I rate them number one along with FIREHOUSE for being true to their style music, and being loyal to their fans. I recommend it."
5,A must have for New Yorkers,"If you have a private roof deck, you have to check this book out. I started designing a garden on my roof and the photographs in this book were inspiring. If you don't have a roof deck, well, this is great for all those New Yorkers who wonder just what is on top of some of New York's buildings (from high-rises to brownstone walkups).Happy Gardening!"
3,Well made,"This is well made and padded well. The label saying that it is a 64"" traditional longbow case is a stretch. I have a 58"" longbow that barely fits into the case and the tag on it says its for a 61"" recurve bow. Well, in any event the case is nice, but don't expect anything bigger than a 58"" bow to fit into it. Points were lost for poor labeling."
1,misinformed,"This product is really expencive, and when I asked about the quality of the masks. I was told it was sturdy. It's not sturdy and it's a giant balloon head! It looks like it's made for King Kong's head! I'm Very disappointed! The price is way too high at $ 126.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,three minute wonder,"The brush itself was just what I wanted for the job. when I went to brush the asphalt sealer on my driveway,which is a very thin liquid material. The very cheap plastic on the end of the handle that screws into the brush snapped ...with not much pressure. I thought well more junk from china.Had to go buy a much better brush for the same money."
5,A MASTERPIECE,"The original foursome of the Pointer Sisters were a very unique r@b act. They were hard to totally describe for their music was so eclectic. All four women were vocally gifted and this cd allows them all to be showcased.Believe it or not they received a grammy for the country tune FAIRYTALE. The others are all hits, no misses. STEAM HEAT is a vocal touyr de force for all four as well as LOVE IN THEM THERE HILLS.I could go through each song but will rather say if you want some quality r@b then this cd is a must have. Also, the digital remastering is amazing. It is just as clear as the album I had as a teen. Amazing and highly recommended. The early Pointer Sisters surely deserve their place in music history."
3,No Front 242 Headhunter???,"I want to order this, but there is no official video listing, just the one given by the first reviewer. That does not list Headhunter!?! :(I want the EGGGGGGGGG!I love eggs!I will order this, as the Joy Division, DM, Echo, Propaganda alone are worth it, but seriously, no Headhunter? WTF?A Grumph! (that's a play on the band as well as my disgruntled state of mind at the moment.)I have given it 3 stars, since I don't have it yet. If Headhunter is indeed included then I will come back and edit my review. I figure 3 stars is ""neutral."""
4,Item not gray as shown in photograph,"Just a heads up that the bag comes in black, not gray as pictured on the webpage as of 8/5/10.Color issues aside, this bag is very good for the money. It Velcros on to any standard bike rack, is made of fairly sturdy canvas, and has a shoulder strap -- what else could you possibly need? Considering most panniers and clip on messenger bags start at $80, this is quite the bargain for those who only have a small amount of groceries or a lunch box to carry."
4,great addition to my gear,I haven't had an opportunity to use this yet but it fits perfect with my saddle bags. I am excited to use this on our trip in June. It will hold my extra essentials.
2,It arrived D.O.A,"This watch arrived with the time and date far off, and as soon as I set them, it stopped working. It has to go back. Other than that, note that it is a bit small - in diameter, and has a very easy to read dial."
1,rip off,"This cd is a rip off....there are only 2 tracks on here......I didn't realize when I bought it.....and it was received with a cracked case...the cd is not cracked, but what's the deal with only 2 tunes??I feel a bit ripped off.....really no stars, but it would not let me submit without one..."
5,Very clear indeed.,"This a very clear and concise book--another one, all of which seem lately to contain the same wisdom: buy low (and buy smart). I'm trying. You can still pay too much, or buy too soon, or catch the wrong end of a falling knife, etc. But it's certainly a far better idea than taking hot tips from e-mails, or from brokers."
4,Investing lessons,"I learned from a broad range of investing books, and I got this one primarily because it was a short book. I'm only about half way through it, but I think it is very well written. It has some important information on how to approach researching a company. One of the glaring failures is how rapidly the trading environment can change. The book specifically tells investors to avoid China, and I've been making a lot of money investing in my first Chinese company. Read and learn, but ultimately decide for yourself on what you want to buy."
1,No Value in this Value Investing Little Book,"Having read a few other books on value investing, I expected this ""Little Book"" to be a good review and quick reverence. Nope! Not either. There is much fluff and little value for anyone with even a beginners knowledge of value investing. If you are a beginner, I would not recommend this as a primer. It was not worth my time to read this book and it is not worth the investment to purchase it. At the same time I purchased two other Little Books ""That Beats the Market"" and ""That Makes You Rich"", and they all rate one star and for the same reasons."
3,Basic Overview Of Value Investing,the book is good as far as you need them only to review the basic principle of value investing. the author explain it well with examples. but you will be hard pressed trying to put these principles into practice
5,Due diligence required before buying,"Key point in this book is your ability to look at prior history, industry averages, and how to do your due diligence before you buy. Then you have your normal number crunching and ratios. This is one of the best books on how to make profitable moves by picking the right stocks at the right time.Other must read investment books suggestion:Investing, Without Losing (ISBN 0978834607 - NOT on amazn on other stores)"
4,clean and simple,"a very simple quick read that gave the readers great insight and very practical. another great book that i am reading right now..""think like a billionaire, become a billionaire"" by Scot Anderson. this author has an amazing ability to capture the readers attention with his humor and character! A must read!!"
4,WHY ONLY 4 STARS?,"1. 4 stars is slightly above average but not overtly hyped as the best.2. Book offers valuable concepts that should be taken to heart for any investor.3. Book really offers no major details or plans on value investing. Just concepts, philosophy, etc. But for the price it's ok.For more recommended books, see my other reviews."
2,Complexity rules!,This book is well writen and understandable but the proposed method is so complex you need a team of resarchers to make it work.Don't bother!M
3,Good enough,"This is a good book to study the principles of mass transfer. It's chapters are long and it requires more specific sample problems. It is organized and has problems to practice, good enough to understand the material."
5,A hit right out of somewhere,"As a long-time Kathy Mattea fan, I have anticipated this CD for a long time. And it does not disappoint. This is simply the best CD of her long and storied career. The CD is a wondrous mix of the passionate, the sad, the uplifting, but mostly it is very thought-provoking. My personal favorite song on the CD is Give It Away. Kathy's road band plays on the CD and they are as great on the CD as they are in concert, lending a delightful mixture of instruments on the various cuts."
1,Poor quality,These sandals are of very poor quality. My son wore them 1 time for an hour and back of his heel got open and was bleeding. I would never expect such a poor quality from stride rite.
1,WELL CRAFTED,"As usual Stride Rite shoes are well made and conservative crafted and styled. This shoe is beautiful. Unfortunately, it did not fit my son's wide feet. His foot overlapped in the section of the sandal that is open, he did not like them. I returned them with no problems."
5,Great cable!,"I bought this cable to replace the HDMI cable I bought at Circuit City the day my HD-DVD player arrived. The cable I bought at Circuit City costed over $60 (w/ tax), and yet never worked properly (intermittent HDMI signal dropout-no picture). I ordered this cable by Tripp Lite to see if it was the Circuit City cable or the player that was the problem.It turns out it was the cable I got at Circuit City (NeXXtech), as this much cheaper Tripp Lite cable works flawlessly (and is much longer I might add, giving me more leeway with my component placement).I don't know if the NeXXtech cable was defective or if it was the noise reduction couplers on each end, but these Tripp Lites don't have the couplers and work great without them. Would definitely recommend the Tripp Lites."
1,"Works, sort of..","My ""ideal"" installation:TV <-> 1ft cable <-> HDMI wall plate <-> 25ft cable <-> HDMI wall plate <-> 3ft cable <-> receiver <-> 1ft cable <-> DVRThis cable just wasn't up to the config above. To get an acceptable picture at all, I had to directly connect the TV to the DVR with this cable, and then I still saw artifacts and occasional signal drops.Replaced with a 22awg cable from Monoprice, which cost a couple bucks less and works perfectly in the configuration described above."
3,This HDMI,"It leaves a straight black line across the top of my LCD, you can def see it, but fo less than 15 it is a deal cause HDMI is better."
2,Good 720p Cable,I've been using this cable for 2 years now with Mitsubishi proyector in 720p and it works great but be aware that for 1080p it won't work!
5,stopczewski,This is the second time that I bought the P568-010 Tripp Lite cable. I could not be happier with the picture that it delivers on my Panaconic Plasma Monitor. The cables are being used daily on two different inputs of my system. Both are super! Try this Cable... you'll love it(especially for the price)!
2,Added noise to 1080p,I had to remove this cable in favor of another -- added visible noise to 1080p signal. I used to in front of a 50' to reach my receiver after I moved it a little further away. (I have an HDMI extender/amplifier at the other end.)
5,Right Product Right Price,"Fine color sharpness, very useable length cable, and unable to see any video or sound difference from cables costing 10 times as much."
3,Texas bride,"I'm still reading it. It is good,but not one I look forward to reading. I am half way threw it.There is not much I can say about it.I would not pay a lot for this book."
5,better than the rest!,I LOVE this! I looked at a bunch and this is by far the best. The changing pad has a padded headrest. I couldn't find one with a padded headrest anywhere so that was one of my requirements. The case is attached to the pad but can be removed (it has velcro). The case itself can hold 6 size 1 diapers and can still close easily. There is room for wipes as well. I didnt use the case but put a travel size case in there. I get compliments all of the time and will purchase this for baby showers! Don't be fooled by the others...this one is the best and my husband even tells others about it...so that means something :)
2,Poor quality,"We initially really liked the changing pad, but after about a week's worth of regular use (5-8 times a day) the outside ripped where the velcro is sewn in. We also found that the plastic that the baby is changed on stains very easily. It's a good size, but poor quality, someone didn't think the design through"
3,You might get pink!,"Don't assume you will receive a neutral color that can be used for either sex. The one I received looks like Barbie threw up on it. Luckily I'm having a girl, although my husband will hate it and it matches none of the other items I have (all neutral colors). Think twice about ordering this item from this seller if you are having a boy."
3,The first few issue are good,"This is the only good Punisher story that Dixon ever did. And like I said only the first few issue are good. I can't remeber witch issue that ends at but the story and the art just get worst. The art done by John Romita Jr. is good at all. John Romita Jr. draws his characters way, way too big, his women and men are ugly, he gives them baggy clothes, he gives people smashed faces and borken noises. It's alright but I guess Dixon just didn't know how to end it."
1,Blah,This album was a disappointment. The listed artists are great singers. The songs offered were less than I expected from each. It felt like the producers that compiled the contents were looking for the worst recording ever made of each artist. I'll probably give this one away.
1,give this one a good think before you buy it,"Right now Ransom is intent on hyping his book on the premise that the ossuary ""must"" be a modern forgery. Big assumption for a journalist to make into the premise of an entire book, considering his arguments come from newspaper articles(!). Every argument he makes stands or falls with one lab analysis that very few scholars believe was correctly carried out. Ransom couldn't care less, because that would spoil his story. What happens if this ossuary turns out not to be a modern forgery, but something much more interesting, like a forgery from Roman times, as has been asserted by, ahem, Harvard scholars? If that turns out to be the case, Ransom's book falls apart at the seams. In any case we should know in about a year whether it's the ossuary or Ransom who's faking it. Save your money."
4,No more Batteries!,I bought it for my kids. They go through batteries like water. Only peeve is its a little bulky. I also like that the adapter can be used on the gameboy itself.
3,great looking but...,"great looking with the heat sinks and all, but I cant tell the difference in speed i went from a CL 3.5 to a CL 2 with these. and a total of 2 Gig vs .75 Gig.Just a splashy looker for me, maybe it will help your system more."
4,"A good read, even if not a follower of the comic; anything with a Gahan Wilson toon in it cant be bad","I came to the ""Odd job"" series side ways, buying the second first and this first one last. All have been good reads, "" ripping yarns"" to borrow a phrase. My only disappointments are having Hellboy and crew ""reintroduced"" over and over as I read each story- by now we know who is who and some unevenness from story to story due Im sure from the different writers. In one, Abe has an inscrutable face and speaks some what formally, in another his expression is readable and says something like ""What are ya doin'""; Hellboys is either unaffected by heat or complains that the summer heat bothers him. Otherwise, good fun!"
3,Warning! Not a comic book!,"I gotta start reading the fine print on these titles; I got totally fooled. I thought it was a comic book, just like the titles right above and below it. It's prose fiction. As in short stories. Yes there are some illustrations by Mike Mignola, but I thought I was getting a collection of Hellboy comics! ..."
4,"Not up to Mignola's best, but. . .","I truly thought this was one of the weaker Hellboy collections. After Seed of Destruction, nothing much else will hold up. However, this is still an excellent book, and Mignola again captures the feel and creepiness of Lovecraft. Hopefully, we'll get another mini-series soon."
3,Good product,"The AC Adapter is a good product. Only small problems. The dual head for the plug to Game Boy and Game Boy Color get in the way when you're playing Color because the AC spot is under the system and not to the side. Also, when switching use between Classic and Color, it's distracting to switch between 3V and 1.5V. But, it's a good product nonetheless."
1,0 Stars... you'll be sorry if you get it,"I got this adapter when my previous one wore out. However, this adapter does not work very well. If you jiggle the Game Boy ever so slightly, the game turns off and you need to start over! AAUUGGHH! Also, you need to ""adjust"" the wire in just the right position or it also won't work! Skip this adapter! There are much, MUCH better ones out there!"
4,gernade,"Very cool looking. Poor funnel design, bb's cannot pour out fast, you should unscrew the top for fast reload."
3,Just not very accurate,"I have been using this product for the last month on marathon training runs. I find that the GPS is not very accurate and the distance measure tends to drift high. For example, on my last 20 mile run the GPS was off by about 1 1/2 miles; it was accurate for some of the trip but gave me readings too high on certain segments. (I was running along a river with little interference from trees or large buildings so I don't have an easy explanation). Other than that the heart rate monitor works fine and the watch functionality is good."
1,GPS reception is very poor,"I bought the watch a week before the Houston Marathon, primarily for the GPS functionality and the design. I tried the watch out the night before, and got a signal. However, I tried to get a signal during the marathon, on a clear sunny day with no obstructions and didn't once get a signal. Very frustrating. I've tried several runs subsequent to the marathon and never got another signal. I'm returning the watch."
2,Very disappointing GPS function,"I bought this product about a year ago after having had the 1st generation Timex/Garmin GPS unit. I ""upgraded"" to the newer (T5J985) model on the assumption that because it was labeled as ""Trail Runner"" the GPS unit had been improved. WRONG! Not only is the GPS reception spotty at best in the woods, it's not much better on the roads with an unobstructed connection to the satellite(s)! Additionally, it often takes at least 10 minutes to link with the satellite. I bought this unit primarily for the GPS functionality. As an experiment I've carried my Garmin Nuvi GPS unit with me on a couple of runs and had no issues with maintaining a link in the woods or on the roads. I'm hoping that Amazon will allow me to swap this product for the Garmin 405 CX unit..."
4,satisfied,I received the product as displayed. Had been using since and satisfied with the performance and quality
2,GPS Unit,"I really like the fuctions of the watch, easy to use and plenty of options. The one complaint I have is the GPS unit. It doesn't work half the time. I could be out on a country road and it goes out on me. Why, I have no idea. Also, when I place the arm strap through it, the backing of the unit came apart, so I had to go to the belt holder. I wear a fuel belt so it wasn't that big of deal, when it worked of course. I have bought Timex watches in the past and never had a problem with their products, but this one is junk."
5,Great for a beginner,"I really like this watch, as a person who use to run and then stopped and now am going to pick it up again, I've read that this is the tool to use to monitor one's training. The watch is straight forward, as Timex watches tend to be. The only caveat, to me, is the synchronization of the GPS to the watch, I seem only to be able to sync the GPS first, then the heart monitor, not the other way around, but that is no major issue, once all is in sync, it works like a charm. Battery life is as expected for an electronic gadget that one uses, real-world scenario: the more you use it, the faster the batteries will drain, even with that, I would recommend it to everyone."
1,Car adapter for gameboy color,"I cancelled my order for this video game. I personally emailed the sender. I sent out an email within the first hour of deciding to make the purchase. If I find out that I have been charged for this item, I will take my business elsewhere and tell other people not to buy from this seller. Also, if I was charged, I didn't even get the item in question in the mail."
1,I've never been so bored. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"After 100 pages, I just can't read another word. It has been 100 pages of the heroine, White Dove, berating the leading man, Jeremy. 100 pages of her going over how inferior he is and why he will never be good enough for her. 100 pages of him trying everything to receive the slightest kind word from her, but she continues insisting on pointing out all of his short comings.The characters are typical and flat. The only one I could find any emotion for was Jeremy, and that emotion was sorrow.I'm very disappointed. I usually prefer books where the female lead character is a strong warrior woman. But this woman was too hard to like.The story is very slow. After 100 pages, there is no progression towards a future at all. It just stands still.Generally, I can get through a good book in a day or two. It has taken 3 days to get this far, and I'm not willing to spend another day hoping it will get better.Having trouble falling asleep at night? Read this book."
2,more like 2 /34 stars:),"Billy Chong stars in this movie portraying a young talented martial artist, who wishes to bring down the ching rebellion. with countless confrontations with ching masters and goons, he get's his shot at the head of the operation. A lot of action, and some good fight scenes, but not much more then that. The highlight of the movie is the very talented and acrobatic master in hiding. not a must see, but you can definately do a lot worse."
3,Commercial for PBS;Good spots if you are a fan,"I am a fan of Richard Kiley and Diahnn Carroll so I ordered this DVD. Patti Lupone and Roberta Peters also sing on it. Shields and Yarnell, Rich Little, and a brief scene with Jayne Meadows and Steve Allen are also on it. I am not exactly sorry I ordered it, but I was disappointed that it is mostly an advertisement for PBS. If you really like any of the performers who do at most three numbers each, then you may enjoy this DVD. There is no story that goes through the DVD. I enjoyed Richard Kiley singing THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM, and Diahnn and Richard singing NO STRINGS from the show that Richard Rodgers wrote alone after Oscar Hammerstein died. It was probably novel at the time to have an interracial couple. So if you really like any of these performers, you may not mind the pleas for PBS. If you like PBS, you may enjoy them."
3,Must Have For Every BDSM Collector!,"BitchGoddess: The Spiritual Path of the Dominant Woman, is a good read for any woman participating in or curious about BDSM sexual practices. This book is not a manual, but a collection of essays, personal accounts and poems that celebrate the image of the dominant woman through history. As any indivdual who lives life beyond societal norms knows, it can be very difficult to find proper reflection in media images. This book assures us that there is a place for the strong, sexually assertive woman in society. It also reminds us that it's nothing new! So if you're looking for instruction you may want to look to other titles. But if you want to wrap your mind around this inspiring archetype, or celebrate your own goddesshood, this is the book for you!"
4,"The spiritual side of ""BDSM""","Do people do that kinky stuff just for sexual pleasure? The answer is no, and this anthology explores the reality that for some people, sex can be a means to spiritual empowerment. Both roles, submissive and dominant, are explored and explained from the view of ""goddess"" imaginery. While not a follower of this particular part of the ""BDSM"" umbrella, I did learn quite a bit from the essays and now can better understand when my partners say that I've helped them see ""god"" -- they should really say ""goddess"" though."

4,Love in Thailand,"Tansy comes to Thailand when she is offered a job as a designer to a clothing manufacturer. One problem. She discovers her new boss is Vin Makram, a man she crossed swords with when she badmouthed the merchandise in a store he owned. But they put their differences aside very quickly, and very soon attraction flows smoothly. One other problem, Vin is apparently deeply entrenched in a relationship with another young woman, a young woman who's father is instrumental in Vin's business, making Vin look like a gigolo. Its obvious Vin likes Tansy, but he keeps telling her to wait for him, without apparent reason. The truth comes out later, and you really feel for poor Vin, being caught in an impossible situation while the women he loved, Tansy, is right in front of him, but he can't touch her. They have a satisfying reunion, and their romance was very gratifying. I give this a high recommendation.Cyndi"
5,unbelievable cd,"if you like pounding techno,i can only advise you:buy this record immediately.especially the first disc with the new songs is really amazing."
5,Exceptional Techno!,"The Advent create distinctive, yet true to the calssic ""four on the floor"" techno style associated with the Tresor label. In fact, it was the inclusion of the Advent on several Tresor compilations that attracted me to their sound. If you enjoy driving, deep dark thumpers, this 2CD offering is more than essential. I've been waiting for this a long time and am happy to say it was worth it!"
5,"CasePlanner, for fraud help & prevention!!!","After purchasing three different software programs, I have finally found the help I needed in CasePlanner. Had I bought CasePlanner when I first heard about it, I wouldn't have wasted over 300 hours of valuable time finding a solution to the problems I am having. With the easy to use forms, I was able to save the necessary information on my own personal computer and print out all the forms and letters I needed to help law enforcement and my creditors help me help myself without hiring high priced lawyers. CasePlanner gets TWO THUMBS UP!!!!"
5,"Beautiful book, exactly what I was looking for",I am using Photoshop and trying to emululate some artist's work. I found this book both informative about Van Gogh andthe prints had more than enough detail so I could see brush/knife strokes. very nice

5,A Powerful Book!,"""Daniel Whyte III has knocked a home run with this book, Letters To Young Black Men. It is a timely book. It is powerful. And it is a life-changing book. We need to get it into the hands of every young black man."""
2,Not easy to secure,This toilet seat is hard to install and we could never get it on tight which made it unsafe. There are better products out there.
3,Raised toilet seat,"Not very sturdy, I had to modify by adding a bracket that I could bolt to the back of the toilet for stability."
4,Zoombox review by Bernadette,"This product is a great gadget for kids and parents alike. I bought it for my son, who loves video games and TV. I liked the fact that he could watch movies or play his game in his room, without being hooked up to cable (although I think this thing can do that - but he doesn't know it!)The only problem we have found with the Zoombox is that there is no way to focus the picture, so sometimes, words are blurry in the projections. He is very happy with the product, and it has been well worth the cost."
3,Pleased but product spotty!,"Pleased because you get the picture from the DVD, but it's honeycombish and not 100% clear as far as colors go. It's watchable when the room is completely dark and mentally you adjust because it's on a 60"" scale opposed to a 37"" or whatever. Some modification's can be done but not bad for the price."
3,have no illusions here,"remember you get what you pay for .if you can afford 2000 to 5000 for a hdtv projector and have a room for a home theater . a dedicated room for this and only this . by all means go and get your self 200 bucks worth of wires and 1700 dollar projector 500 dollar screen and a 1000 theater in a box sound system you will have a really nice set up to impress everyone with . if you want something for yourself and the odd saturday football or hockey game . other wise a 300 dollar zoom box with a 74X80inch pulldown blind will do you just find,it is a home theater for under 500!"
2,good DVD player but little everything else...,"This is a toy and not a projector. Like I said in the title the DVD player is quite good no skiping or anything like that the first problem is that the door for the DVD is easily opened and sometimes while I am adjusting the image to the screen the DVD door pops open stopping the movie. The body is flimsy and weak made out of thin plastic. The resolution is one quater the amount of any projector just a few hundred dollars more. The room has to be pitch black and even then I have to strain my eyes to see the image in other words the lamp in the projector is very weak. Also as you project on a screen if you sit within five feet of the screen you can no longer see the image but rather the dots that make up the image. for seven hundred dollars or so you can get a cheap projector, dosen't have DVD player but the projector will be twice as good."
1,a lemongot a,GGot a zoom box for a xmas gjft dies not even work got 3dissappointed boys sits in the box til i can take it to be fixed at a tv/vcr shop
4,Good buy for the money,We set up the projector in the back yard using a sheet as the screen and it worked great. The sound is a little low which is the only issue. The picture is also a bit grainy if you try to enlarge the screen too much.
1,Very Disappointing purchase,"I'm a teacher, so I thought it would be cool to get a relatively cheap LCD projector for movies, powerpoints and other educational media. The image quality is very poor and the volume is too low at its highest setting. The kids could not hear or see, so they paid no attention to the movie and the kids that did want to watch couldn't hear over the talking. I paid $299 at Target and I called to see if I could return and they will take it back with the receipt, thank goodness. I would be incredibly upset if I had to keep this horrible thing."
3,DECENT,"I bought the projector looking for a bit better quality but after all it is sold as a toy. It shows areally good picture but it wasnt so ""honeycomb-ish"" it would be very good. This will be great for trips and backyard parties @ night to project onto the side of the house....overall IM SATISFIED."
4,Zoombox in the classroom,"I used the Zoombox in my history classroom to show an educational program. It proved to be a great experience. I plugged in two external powered speakers and the kids really enjoyed it (pretty unusual if you remember some of the stuff you had to see in the classroom). For educators, what a great cost-cutter too!. A DVD player, plug-ins for VCR, etc., and no tv set to hassle with! Oh yes, another feature, no [...] bulb to replace should the projector bulb go out (our librarian loved that concept). Bulbs can be puchased at any camera store for around 40 bucks."
5,zoombox dvd entertainment projector,"we use it for our selves,it's really not a toy,but we paid a toy price,thanks amazon.comwe love youJeannie Dionisio"
3,Does it allow closed captioning on the screen?,"I have a question and I hope someone can answer it. When you use the projector on the wall, can you use closed captioning? I have a Deaf son and he needs subtitles.Thanks."
1,O well....,"When i found out about the ZoomBox i was amazed , how can this be so cheap so i tried finding a reiviw but i coudent , then i looked at the specs , sadly the reiview above this is right the resolution is only 557 x 234 !! . My psp screen is only like 4 inches and has a res of 480 bye somthing . My cam on 640 res and take a pic then print it is blurry cuase it has to get streched and the paper is like 8x12 ich i think sooo blow it up to 60 inch at res of 557 x 234 and 60 ich and it will become so blurry it doesnt matter if your wearing glasses or not ""horrible"" but o well , if they made this just 800x600 ooooohhhh that would be fine but 557 x 234 NO it just wont work."
2,Zoombox DVD Player,The focus adjustment barely works so you have to move the unit around to get a clear picture. Resolution is not very good and the sound is not very loud. I would not reccommend this product.
1,Zoombox is Garbage!,"The Zoombox is garbage! This is a great idea gone very wrong. Nothing about this product is works. Even in a pitch black room, the projector's light isn't strong enough to throw an acceptable image on a wall much less a ceiling... And if you are actually lucky enough to get an image it's completely fuzzy. Amazon should discontinue all sales of this item. Please do not waste your money."
1,Overpriced Piece of Junk,"Wow, I can't believe I paid $300 for a child's projector. Here I thought I was getting this National Amusements movie theater in a box, but it turned out to be nothing more than a farce. It's like one of those big, pink microphones that kids play with. I mean, sure it amplifies your voice, but I doubt Bon Jovi would consider using it at one of his concerts. Point is, you get what you pay for, and if you think you're going to get this Hollywood movie machine for such a low price, you're mistaken, because this digital projector costs $300 for a reason."
1,Do not get this! 8 years old,"I was wondering why this item was so cheap. I tried it out, and I thought it should be worth less than even 100 dollars. The resolution is harable. Me and my sister was going over my cousins house for a sleep over. So I thought, why don't we ask my dad for this so we can watch movies on a ""cool"" projection screen, for a cheap price.But when we got there and turned it on, my cousins and I were really disopointed. The picture was so dim, that even our night light was brighter than that. The picture was also so pixelly and digitally messed up, even if you only blew the screen up to 30 inches, it would not show good. Take my word on this, DO NOT BUY THIS. I"
5,"""If you like his calendars you will love the book.""",The book is great for little ones to look at because the book is big A colorful.
3,Good,"I don't want to write negative reviews but I do feel like I need to be honest. I really like Jerry's writing style but this was my least favorite work from him. The 400 pound baby thing was a little too weird for me. The bouncing between people zoning in front of the TV was a little dull. Don't get me wrong, I read through the whole book and felt like it was a decent experience but, if your new to Jerry's work, his other stuff is so much better."
3,Okay,So far the chapters I have read have been vague on the nursing care aspect. I feel like I am reviewing psycology. I want more information on how to care for the mentally ill as a nurse. I do like that it is an easy read and chapters are fairly short.
4,This book was helpful,"This book was helpful in giving ideas, reference, and how-to on s10 customizing. As the previous reviewer complain, it does have everything that truckin' puts in their magazines; however, it is hard to come across those magazine when you are looking for something specific. The book even says that it is ""from the editors of Truckin' magazine."" My only problem with the book was it only showed what to do with mini trucks and normal trucks, it didn't give any info on lifting an s10, or anything about 4wd (which happens to be what i own). Other than that, the engine modification section, as well as the audio, wheel, and electrical, where very informative; even to some one that has just gotten in to the hobby of customizing his/her car, like me."
2,Spend your money on Truckin' Magazine,"After 5 minutes of this book, it became a coffee table coaster. It contains information that Truckin' Magazine has EVERY FRIGGIN MONTH! The detailed descriptions, oh the detailed descriptions. This thing is lucky to be receiving 2 stars."
4,It works but be aware...,"I was very pleased with the delivery response. It came within 3 days(to Ohio at the time). The couplers do not look like the picture in Amazon, but they worked just fine. They snapped onto the A/C system connections solidly and released easily.One thing I noticed while pulling vacuum was that the low side coupler would leak if it was pulled askew by the low side gauge hose. So be aware that these couplers have to seat squarely on their mating A/C system ports. I don't know if this is a general problem with the R-134a coupler/port design. With this in mind I like these couplers. They are well made and easy to use. The release rings are not colored as shown in the picture. Instead they have red and black bands on a silver colored release ring."
5,Top quality product,We are well pleased with the quality and functionality of this product. Lightning fast shipping also.
5,Great Tool,"This is a great product for HVAC repairs on automobiles. If you have a set of gauges meant for house AC's such as R410a or R22, these little adapters allow you to convert your house gauges into R134A gauges and saves you the money of having to buy new gauges. I used them the other day with my house gauges to charge an R134a system in a Toyota Tundra, they worked great. Now I can use my gauges with any system, and not have to buy a bunch of gauge sets. These adapters are built solid and work great."
1,The Price Pro's are doing a bait and switch !!!,"They are NOT 8 ball style couplers, they are only 6 ball style couplers and are pron to leak. Don't buy from The Price Pro's !!!"
1,May not work on your car,"The only reason that I gave these 1 star, is that I couldn't give them 0 stars. While they physically snapped on the connectors, they didn't open the valves. My experience was on a 1996 Ford F150. The connectors on the Harbor Freight Gauge Set (which I then went out and bought)(I'm not a fan of harbor freight, either) worked correctly."
2,Not as expected,"I bought these to use with my R-12 manifold in hopes of being able to swap between using the manifold for R-12 and R-134a. However, you have to remove the valve stem from the R-12 hose as this adapter will not release the stem. Not a quick swap as I thought it would be. Beyond that problem, they appear to be of good quality and do work. I just wish it would have been better described."
4,R-12 to R-134a couplers,"The couplers are not real rugged, but worked fine for me as I am not a heavy duty user. Good product for the average joe."
3,Good series but IS NOT the 1980s version,"This is the 1990s Mike Hammer Private Eye series which takes place in Los Angeles and has Shannon Whirry as Velda. It's a good series but is not the gritty, womanizing and violent Mike Hammer that we came to know and love from the 1980s ""Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer"" and ""The New Mike Hammer""; neither of which to my knowledge has currently has seen the light of day in a DVD boxed set (although several of the tv movies from the same decade are available)."
5,Mike Hammer Boxed Set,"This boxed set contains all 26 episodes of the 1997 ""Mike Hammer - Private Eye"" series. Stacy Keach is excellent as Mike Hammer and I like the added cast members Shane Conrad as Nick and Shannon Whirry is VERY easy to watch. There is abundant eye-candy with pretty and shapely young women in every episode. Also ""the Face"" the elusive attractive ""face in the crowd"" played by Rebbeca Chaney (the grand-niece of Actor legend Lon Chaney). Then there is Kent Williams as the ADA you love to hate. These are nicely packaged on four DVDs in separate cases. Highly recommended!!SBJ"
5,MICKEY SPILLANE COULD WRITE THEM WELL,AN EXCELLENT SERIES AND WELL WORTH THE FEW BUCKS IT COST TO PURCHASE FROM AMAZON TO ENJOY HOURS OF GREAT TV. STACY KEACH DOES THE ROLE WELL AND DON STROUD MAKES AN AFFABLE COP BUDDY... LOTS OF GREAT EPISODES AND PLENTY OF FUN....
3,Not the 1980s series,"First, I'll say I do enjoy this series. However, the sound, the video quality, the music and Velda were better in the 1980s. Lindsay Bloom is the quintessential Velda. She is what I think of when I think of Velda. Tanya Roberts is close, but just doesn't have the personality and personal characteristics that make Lindsay Bloom so adorable. She isn't just sex, she is personality, cuteness, behaviorally and things I just can't put words to. There is just some feeling I get watching the 1980s series that I don't feel with the 1990s series. It can't be explained, except that the 1990s being filmed in CA didn't help. It lost the feeling of the New York nights and the streets and people, the places and feeling of New York. The better music in the 1980s series helped a lot, too. We need to bombard CBS with letters and email asking them to make the 1980s series available on DVD."
1,Mike Hammer Private Eye,"This DVD is a great disappointment and is painfull to watch. The acting is terrible. The story is choppy and difficult to follow. As soon as Mike Hammer meets a female they go to bed portraying nothing but gratuitous sex which adds nothing to the story. The story moves along and all of a sudden Hammer kills the object of the search with little build up. After the killing he explains the why. Also, throughout the episodes there is far too much fighting ans killing. I see this DVD as having on redeeming value."
5,A Wish Come True,"My husband is a big Stacy Keach/Mike Hammer fan. With this purchase, I can't get him from in front of the TV. He is absolutely thrilled with the videos."
5,Mike Hammer Boxed Set,It was entertaining and kept us in suspense. We enjoyed watching Mike Hammer series on TV years ago and watching this DVD lived up to our expectations. Only at the end did we find out who the culprits really were. We highly recommend this movie to mystery buffs.
4,MIKE IS MIKE.,"KEACH WILL ALWAYS BE THE MIKE HAMMER KNOWN TO TELEVISION. THIS LATER VERSION EXCLUDES DON STROUD FROM THE CAST AND HAS A DIFFERENT MYSTERY WOMAN AND VELMA. STACY PLATS HIM AS HE ALLWAYS HAS WITH WIT AND ALWAYS SEEMS TO GET TO PORK THE GIRLS. NICE SET. HAIL RHODESIA, DEATH TO MUGABE AND SHIBAZZ- THAT PIG PORKING PIECE OF MUHAMMEDAN CRAP."
1,Well let's see--,"If this book is anything like their web site I'd say women will be fooled into thinking they will know everything there is to NASCAR by this dynamic duo. Just look at the flag page on their website (which looks like a pot headed high school student put together, ""Hey garage girls it's not that hard to learn HTML!""). It's missing a flag and the description of the blue and yellow strip flag say's the flag is just for Rookie drivers! HEH? WHA?? Just rookie drivers??? The best part is they ""Thank"" some D.A. who wrote in to tell them this little fact. And thank god they stopped posting information on the upcoming Nextel Cup race's, (since they screwed up the Daytona 500 and said it was 400 miles long).Oh I see they have a Bristol page for this weekends race coming up. I'll check that out and when i find the obvious errors there i will post back again on this page.I'm not here to promote this book or any other but I did read Nascar for Dummies..... They got the flags correct."
3,Pastor Resources,"I found this book to be good for Christian denomination weddings. It covers a wide range of these. However, it excludes a non-denominational or non-religious wedding. Nonetheless, for someone conducting a wedding, it will provide you with some great ideas about different facets of the ceremony."
4,Good resource for chaplains,"This book is a good resource for anyone with a responsibility to marry people in an ecumenical setting. I am a chaplain, and this guide has been very helpful in planning and preparing weddings for people of different ecclesiological backgrounds. It is clear, concise, and well-presented."
1,Misrepresented on Amazon,"I just received this book. The description states it is leather bound with ribbon markers. This book is NOT leather bound, nor are there any ribbon markers. The book I received was a cheap copy, produced with fiberboard covers. Going back. Not acceptable."
3,"Love this scent, does not last as long as the car trees","I purchased the Jasmin scent in a bottle because I love the car trees. It's the exact same scent however, it does not last as long as the trees. This particular vendor's shipping is extravagant. If I had to do it again, I would not purchase the spray. Stick with the trees."
3,READ THIS !!! It might change your mind!!!,"I bought this game, and I expected it to be awesome. I was kind of disappointed.Well, 1st of all, the gameplay was ok. The stability was not so incredibly good. Sometimes the game will shut down after a mission( the missions are ok, but it takes a long time for each 1). It was easy to learn. Multiplayer on the web isnt that great, because NO BODY plays on the internet with this game. Its just too old, which also is the reason for my 3-star rating. The graphics aren't as good as the cover looks, believe me. The smoke from planes is a greenish color. Sounds weird, huh? Well thats the way it is on my computer. I guess I should have considered that this game was made in 1998. Well, I guess this game was good a few years ago, but its just too outdated.P.S. this game doesn't run on 2000 or ME (it says 95-98 on the box)"
2,euorpean air wars,"this was really highly reccomended by several but was a major dissapointment=after playing world war 11 fighters I guess I got spoiled=the sound and special effects just were not there.flight control not bad=I have more than enough system requirements to handle any game out there=as I said, a really ho hum game!"
1,European Air War,The problem is that it doens't run on a intel based graphic card. But the helpdesk was really professional.
5,User add-ons to European Air War make it the BEST!,"This game is the best WWII European theater Air War sim available. Yes, it is 3 years old now, but there are TONS of very high-quality free add-ons available that really take it to a completely new level. Don't judge this game by what is just in the box-- new planes, terrains, campaigns and other graphical improvements by the user community are what make this so special. Do a google search on European Air War or EAW and you can find some nice sites for add-ons."
1,Disappointing,"This ""strategy"" guide is mostly maps and a very high level walk-thru.I own multiple guide from Prima and are normally very happy with their products, butThis one is a disappointment.My advice - Don't waist you money on this guide."
2,Chotto hayai!,"The material in this book is excellent, as the cover of the book states it is equivalent to 2 years of college study.However, while that might be the case I found the pace of this book too fast. One definitely does not get enough practice of the material covered in the chapters (some of it is NEVER practiced or tested), so a few days and chapters later I would forget what I'd learnt. And just to reemphasise, the pace of the book is very fast. Might be good if u had Japanese people around all the time to practice with, but if you don't - something like Japanese for Busy People will go down much better.Although the material in the book is excellent - the quality of teaching is mud."
4,Ultimate Japanese,"A lot more product for the money spent, well worth buying this product. Getting two years worth of education on the Japanese language."
2,too fast,This book assumes that you have a basic understanding of japaneese words. This is very tough for a beginner to follow. The sentences are very fast and there is no time to get the basics. Not recommended for the beginner.
3,"Some good, some bad","I like that this set includes CDs that are entirely in Japanese. They have some very realistic conversations, uninterrupted by English, that are great for listening to just to get the feel of the language.What I didn't like was that the CDs that did include English often offered translations that I considered to be rather inaccurate.My biggest complaint was that one of the CDs was entirely in Italian--quite a shock, I tell you, when you load it into the car CD player. Fortunately, it was one of the CDs with English translation that I didn't like anyway. Annoying nonetheless.This set offers some good Japanese conversation for those that are studying Japanese in a class setting, but I would use it as a supplement and not depend on it to learn the language."
3,A good guide,"This book serves as a very solid textbook for learning the language. Each lesson is well-structured, starting with a conversation and then explaining different grammatical points and usage. It has been and will continue to be my primary guide for learning Japanese. The audio will be an important pronounciation tool for those of you who don't have a Japanese mother (as I do).However, you must be your own teacher. There are no exercises, only limited testing (you can pass the tests without having mastered the material, such as vocab), and very little added fun. I don't mind the additional work of making my own exercises, but it's not for everyone. And I have lots of personal motivation to keep me going, which is absolutely necessary if you use this as your guide."
4,Useful Tool for Brushing Up and Expanding Vocabulary,"I studied Japanese for 2 years at college level 11 years ago and also spent 2 months in Japan then. Since that time, my Japanese has suffered considerably since I live in the States and have very little opportunity to practice. I am travelling to Japan this year and really want to be able to communicate with native speakers. I have been using this series for the last 3 months and it has been a very useful tool for re-learning what I have forgotten as well as expanding my current vocabulary. Some of the lessons move a little quickly and should use a few more verbal examples when introducing new usage. I think it might be a little difficult for someone with absolutely no Japanese experience, but for people wanting to brush up (and not waste time learning to count to 10) it's great."
3,"A real commitment, and then some","This is _very_ flat. Not at all fun. If your trying to use this to learn on your own, good luck, I found it do be very difficult. The quality of the CDs is excellent, however its very dry. The lessons are not structured to make you feel accomplishment, so it was very hard for me to keep with it. I have switched to another book, but the ""learn on the go"" cds are still good, even if boring."
3,eh.,"i don't love this book, don't hate it. i don't know what i was hoping for... maybe some exercises to help me learn. still, the content is informative. if you're good at teaching yourself stuff, this book would be helpful."
3,excellent ... but,"I have only got up to Lesson 5 so far and everything is fine but for one MAJOR drawback.The translations in English for the ""double O"" sound, simply use ""oo"" rather than as in other books an ""o"" with a horizontal line above it.e.g the book has IKIMASHOO, YOOHOO, DOOZOIt is almost impossible for any English-speaking reader to read the above without giving those ""OO"" syllables the usual pronunciation in English as in 'shoot' or 'fool'. Thus the English text rather than being a help with pronunciation, is actually a definite hindrance.Putting a pencil stroke through all those second Os is very time-consuming!"
5,These are not the WSJ glasses,"I inadvertently ordered these to replace the glasses recommended by the Wall Street Journal. These are not the glasses. The recommended glasses are the Spiegelau Vino Grande Burgundy Wine Glasses. These are slightly smaller, with a less broad bottom.Still, I'm sure they're wonderful...just not what was in the Journal."
3,Cuts well but auto feed does not work with this line,"The hexagon string cuts much better and lasts longer then the round .065 string that came with the trimmer. This is a 40 volt battery powered trimmer that has a string feed that differs from the traditional ""tap on the ground"" feed but I don't think the string feed is the reason the feed does not work. When I open up the string reel I find the sting has partially melted in spots and causes the sting to stick together. I have had this happen with other larger diameter strings with other trimmers. I live in south Florida and the grasses I trim probably have a much tougher stem than in a more northern climate. I will still use the product, it only takes a minute to manually pull more string. It is not a perfect solution but it is one that I am willing to use."
5,A love-song to Belfast,"I am currently reading Eureka Street for the third time. This time I am reading it and taking notes at the same time. - I am going to write my Extended English Essay about Eureka Street and therefore I am studying the novel down to the smallest detail - it makes the novel even better! After having read some of the other's reviews, which I have found somewhat helpful, I was thinking that it would be lovely to hear what you Eureka Street-lovers out there think of it. So feel free to write me and tell me your opinion on the novel. Thank you so much. Also I can recommend a book called Writing the North by an Italien author, Laura P. It deals with the modern Northern Irish literature. It is fab and very interesting, indeed."
3,Lots of laughter in an unusual view of everyday Belfast.,"The female chararacters are just caricatures, the author's own politics intrude too much into the plot, and I didn't believe the story's happy ending. Despite that I would recommend this book to anyone. Some of the phrases in here are pure poetry, and there are lots of moments where you'll find yourself laughing out loud (embarrassing if you're on the morning train). It's obvious that McLiam Wilson loves the city of Belfast, and this book helps you understand why."
5,"Eureka Street, The best novel to be published in years.","Eureka Street was by far the best book I have ever read in my life (so far). Being that I have never read a novel having to do with Northern Ireland, and that I am rather naive about the area, I found myself to be VERY interested in Belfast and the characters Wilson had created. While reading this book, I found myself falling in love with Jake Jackson and his small adventures in his everyday life. I have never grown so fond of a novels' character then I have of his. Chuckie was also quite lovable, but I tend to favor Jake. When the book was comming to an end, I found myself sad that it was over. The ending surprised me, but at the same time, it didn't. Now, I have become one of Robert McLiam Wilson's greatest fans. He is a genius in his writing and a brilliant story-teller. I will always enjoy a peice of writing from him. Eureka Street is a wonderful novel, and just as Wilson states, ""A Novel of Ireland Like No Other"""
5,A book I was afraid to finish.,"""Eureka Street, Belfast"" really touched me. It was not only the sort of newly-invented language but the whole story. The ""I""-form was very fluently to read and, so, great sympathy with the narrator had its space to develop. And though I got hit by reality (well, that's life!), especially in chapter 11, I took a deep breath and soon recovered to enjoy the rest of the book. I must say I was really scared to finish it because it could have lasted much longer for its greatness and the emotions it makes the reader go through."
4,Understated Look at Belfast,"Wilson's ""Eureka Street"" is a look at Belfast that is not redily available in the U.S. The character's are not. They are people with definative characteristics. The interwoven tale using different narration techniques lets the story unfold and does not overload the reader with unending minutia that is, unfortunately, all too common in fiction today.A great book that would be five stars, but I'm waiting for his next book, which I'm sure will not dissapoint."
2,review for Eureka Street,"I quite enjoyed this author's previous work, but this novel of two friends in Northern Ireland fell flat for me. The book editor needed to reel in the author's desire for boring, non-essential details of the characters' lives that neither moves the story forward nor gives insight into the character arcs. This is not the era of Dickens. You need not worry about getting paid by the word. If I were the editor, I would cut the middle, because the beginning and the ending were quite good. The characters are intriquing, but I got lost in the lackluster sections of the novel."
5,Slaying the Dragon. by Michael Johnson,"This is a fantastic book and will inspire any person in any fieldto motivate themselves to better things in life.Regards,Leo. (Australia)"
5,The Dragon is Dead,"I am an elementary school librarian who is always also on the look out for great books. My father walked in the house one afternoon with Mr. Johnson's book. I picked it up and couldn't put down, it is just that good. My father was planning to donate the book to his school's college library. I loved the book so much that he bought me my own copy. The thing I like most about Mr. Johnson's book is that the brother is real. He shares his defeats as well as his victories. He is clear about his goals, discipline, and consistency in character and values. He believes that each individual has a gift that must be developed and used to make life better. Lastly, what is most refreshing about his book is his display of love and admoration for his parents and family; in addition his respect for teachers. This book is well worth the investment of money and time."
5,This book is changing my kid's life,"When I bought the book at a used book store, I had no idea what it was like. I just wanted a book for my 13 year-old son to read and maybe enjoy. We had been to the '96 Games and had seen the 200M race so I thought he could relate even though my son hates to run. I had him read a few pages out loud each day so I could hear his pronounciation but within a few days I began to realize what this book has to offer. I also noticed a change taking place in my son as he read the words. I really can't do justice to the book but I can tell you the message Michael Johnson has for young people has the power to change lives. I am grateful to Mr Johnson for what he has given my son."
1,Fuzz everywhere!,"This throw was a big disappointment. It's soft and warm -- I'll give it that -- but in no time your clothes, your nightgown, your cushions, are covered with lint from this throw. Not only that, but it says you can't dry it in a gas dryer (actually, they tell you to put it on ""air only"" in ANY dryer, which is insane), I would have sent it back, but it was just too much trouble. I won't use it again, however. Buyer beware!"
5,The best,"This throw is so soft and comforting that I own two and gave three away as gifts. Everyone who sees the one on my sofa, or owns one, compliments it."
4,Softest blanket I've ever had,"When I took this blanket out of the package, I couldn't believe how soft it was. I thought it was going to be a fleece throw but instead it is very plush. I have been using it for a little over a week and it is warm, lightweight and a pleasure to feel on my skin. I have noticed that some fuzz does come off and stick to my clothes but am wondering if that will be taken care of once I throw the blanket in the wash. I'll write an update once the blanket has been washed a few times."
5,I never want to leave my sofa again,"This is the BEST throw - much more than I expected for the money. It is so soft and warm, and the larger size is great. You can pull it up to your chin and still cover your toes (I'm 5' 5"")! I got the Cuban Sand - it is a very nice, soothing color, complementary to just about any other color. It did shed a lot for me on the first washing and I had to vacuum it a few times (and I'm still picking up beige fuzz balls around the house) but I think it's worth that little bit of temporary inconvenience for such a great blanket at a good price. It does get fluffier after washing for the first time too."
2,Dissapointed,"I'd seen my daughters blanket, same label, so I ordered one. Not the same thing at all - the pile on the one I received is only half the length of the pile on hers. Hers can be described as cuddly - mine? A very poor second in the cuddly stakes. Pity the picture didn't show the difference. The label says Berkshire Blanket and below that it says A touch different. It certainly is!"
2,not as expected..,"My daughter gave me a Searasoft throw for birthday.. I loved it.. but when I ordered three of what I assumed would be the same, they were a huge disappointment.. Mine was three times more plush, soft, and almost sensual.. The ones I received were not as I expected.. I know there must be several varieties, but was most sad to find the difference so huge. I still gave them as gifts. I know mine had a picture of a face on the front of the package, and the ones I ordered had a scene on the package.. I later found out that the former style was very limited and no doubt sold out.. Hope you continue to make the really plush ones.. they are most superior."
2,Too PC,"Ok so this is the plot. A young, beautiful, firefighter, belonging to a ""hotshot"" elite unit dies due to cutbacks, and bad policy stemming from protocols designed to protect rich people's property. So the flat girl character died on the job. Everyyear firefighters risk their lives in similar situations and yes some do die. So we are led to sympathy because she's a woman. Its just as tragic if a man dies. Bad ploy. I think that Joni should have entered the corporate scene and stayed away from high risk employment. She might not have made as big a statement as by tereading on traditional ""man's ground"", but she would have lived and spared her family all that grief. I just found it hard to have sympathy for her."
5,Noise + beatz =,"dialectical friction between ripping d-n'-b programming and galactic-terrorist monoliths of improv guitar shreik synthesizes into the most compelling genre cluster-funk since Derek Bailey's _Guitar Drum n' Bass_ ...the future sound of the underground grabbed impatiently by the scruff of the neck and shoved in your face today, without any consideration for bandwagons or medical histories...on the same label as diabolical culture-jamming noise legends Condemek, which may reveal the identities of certain of the otherwise anonymous bandmembers...""hard step""? try ""hardcore crush""...the Chemical Brothers will never sound like this; maybe you'll be grateful..."
2,somewhat sloppy editorial work,"For the Millennium edition that many people might choose to keep, glitches should be reduced to minimum. Adrienne Clarkson is Canada's Governor General since the 7th of October 1999, not Roméo LeBlanc. Canada highest peak (Mount Logan) is 50 meters lower. Printing white-red Polish national flag in black is an error no corrector (proofreader) should miss, if they cared to take a look at the page (there are no flags like that). After explaining Imperial and metric systems editors used yet another one (CGS) in their explanation of the famous Einstein's formula."
2,"I love Clamp, but I was unimpressed by volume one","I did research on the plot of this manga online and through friends, and it seemed really interesting (in a good way), so I purchased volume one. Unfortunately, the plot moved reaaaaaaaaaalllllyyyyy slowwwwwwwwwww. I felt unfulfilled reading volume one, and I am hesitant on purchasing volume two. Again, the plot sounded amazing, but the pace is very slow and the battle art was just a tad but unimpressive to me.I apologize to the people who love this manga, especially since I love CLAMP as much as the next person, but based on Volume one I don't think the story will move at a pace that's comfortable to me."
2,I'm rather indifferent to this manga so far,I hate to say it after being told how good this manga was but I had a hard time making it through the first volume with out falling asleep(which is rather short). I'll still buy the second volume to see if it gets better(the first Gunnm(Battle Angel) wasn't so hot either but improved by leaps and bounds by the second volume). And I am slightly interesting in what happens to the characters. But for the most part the story telling fell flat.
5,Excellent but somewhat Confusing,"X/1999 is a wonderful, compelling series that almost anyone could enjoy. But its not for children under, say, 10 - 12 because there is language, violence and nudity. For those of you that don't know, X/1999 is about the earth ending, and 7 members of the dragons of earth, who want to destroy the earth and start over, and 7 of the dragons of heaven, who want to keep the earth as it is. They are all chosen, but one, Kamui, was chosen for both, and has the power to decide which will happen, but frankly, he doesn't care about it or anything but himself. If you like sci-fi/fantasy (sorcery ect.) and a touch of romance, you'll love this."
1,Terrible recorder,It stopped working 2 weeks later. Poor manufacturing. Its settings are barely readable. What a waste of money!
2,not for me,"My skin feels itchy and sticky from this toner. After you get past the stickyness though (which lasts ages) your skin is silky smooth. I don't recommend this product to someone who has sensitive skin (like me.) If you don't have sensitive skin and you don't mind waiting a few hours for the stickyness to pass, then you might want to try it."
2,Only for DRY skin,"Smells nice and very mild cleanser. However, if you have oily skin, or average skin, I would not suggest this product. It is highly moisturizing (the soap and cream) and causes moderate to oily skin to break out more severly. Again, this is a good product is you have severily dry skin!"
2,Not Reliable Information,"It has a fairly good section on anatomy, carpel tunnel syndrome and hand exercise, but too much of the information presented in the book is incorrect, some of it is foolish. The author is not an qualified expert, but has lots of opinions. Unfortunately, she presents many of her own opinions as if they were factual. Her erronous opinons are often derived from common nail myths and misunderstandings. In my opinion, this book is not reliable source of information."
4,an enduring influence on the Slavs,"Obolensky gives us a scholarly, well footnoted discourse on the interactions between Byzantium and the Slavic peoples. He describes how a multiethnic and multicultural interaction that went on for centuries. As Byzantium turned its focus north and east, into what is now eastern Europe and Russia.The use of Greek Orthodox missionaries to convert those peoples led to a great influence by the patriarchs in Constantinople over the Dukedom of Moscow, and an enduring imprint on Russian culture and language.We see many struggles with the Ottomans, which would ultimately lead to the downfall of Byzantium. But its legacy lived on in the Slavic realms. The book should also help you appreciate why Moscow traditionally called itself the Third Rome. Constantinople was the Second Rome. And when it fell, many refugees fled to Moscow, which then took upon itself to assume that mantle."
4,Ezra Jack Keats' DVD,This is a great DVD for the holidays. Our granddaughter enjoyed it over and over during her visit with us. Actually we have purchased several Scholastic videos and have been pleased with all of them.
2,"Unoriginal, unilluminating gloss","This Penguin series, which looks so promising on paper, has become increasingly disappointing. Excepting Gary Wills's argumentative, riveting St. Augustine and Peter Gay's predicably smart Mozart, they read like Landmark Books for adults, and this one is especially lite. How corny is it to begin with a paragraph of bad puns or to assume that whatever Joyce wrote in his fiction can be applied to his biography? If Dedalus said his mother smelled better than his father, is it fair to say that of Joyce without even a source attribution? You might as well stick with the man himself, though if you really want a biography, invest the time in Ellmann's masterpiece or search for Scholes's brief In Search of James Joyce. I can't see that O'Brien brings much to the party."
2,increasingly disappointing,"I agree with the previous reviewer, that while this series Penguin Lives series looks so promising on paper that it is becoming increasingly disappointing, particularly this book. It tries too hard to be a novel and employs too many literary tricks and devises to pull it off as even a short biography. As a real biography nut I have been following both the Penguin Lives series and the Lives & Legacies series by the Crossroad Publishing Company. While the Lives & Legacies series does not tout the big authors this series does, the writing is exellent and in just 192 pages they manage to include the backmatter, that as a reader of even short form biography want and expect. Really, this series is worth checking out. Admirably as well, this series supports both new and established authors. First, that's rather rare these days in the publishing world; and second, it's great to hear some new voices."
2,Junk,"I had it for 2 weeks when I had to tape the tubes together. went nuts trying to get bags for it. The bags are too small, have to keep changing them. Thats fine for a tagalong but you are carrying it on your back it means you have to keep taking it off! not designed for what a backpack is designed for."
5,Best of Ernest T . Bass,We had one previously years ago and we watched it so much that it broke. I was thrilled to find another one. It will be for my husband's birthday.
1,Terrible.,"I Ordered This Item Because I Was In Need Of A Mouse Pad For My Desk, When It First Arrived, It Was Darker Than The One In The Picture, And I Noticed That There Was Some Peeling At The Edges. At First It Wasn't A Big Deal, And I Decided To Use It Anyway, But After Two Days It Had Peeled All Around The Edges From Normal Use, And I Was Left With The Base Of The Mouse Pad Being Barely Covered By The Flimsy Fabric. It's Been A Week Now, And The Fabric Had Peeled Completely Off, So Now I'm Left With A Black Foam Square That I Paid Three Dollars For."
2,Does not grip the desk as a mouse pad should!,"Although the color and the light weight of this mouse pad are fine, it does not adhere, or ""grip"" the desk as it should, so the slightest movement against it will dislodge it from whatever position it has been put in. Had I known this I would not have ordered it. This is not a normal mouse pad, and I am surprised the manufacturer thinks that it is acceptable ""as is."""
2,Not much to say about this mouse pad,"Needed a cheap mouse pad for the kids and this did the trick. It does tend to slip around way to easily though because it's small and so light weight. If you use your mouse at all, investing in a larger and heavier mouse pad will save you headaches."
5,So many Russians could'nt be wrong,"This tea is a very big surprise. I have really enjoyed this tea in the evening. It is like desert to a diabetic. It's like cheating. The taste is mild and slightly sweet without adding sugar. Importantly to me is that it does not have a lot of caffene, and I can have it at 8:00 pm when I am reading a novel and allow me to go right to sleep. I will order this product again and again."
2,Junior slump,"Having waited for the album for a long time, I have to say I am disappointed. They are trying to go for a new sound here, more harder, and in many cases end up coming off like Nirvana wannabes. Hotter Than the Sun is the only great track, with Deadly Handsome Man certainly good but not exceptional. Many of the lyrical ""stories"" Woz puts in here sound forced and highschoolish to me. I would MP3 a few songs and wait for their next album, hopefully a return to the style of their first two."
2,Something's missing...,"I love Marcy Playground, but even after multiple plays this album is not as good as their previous two. I don't know the make-up of the band enough to know if it is the departure of one of the original three members, or if they are just stuck in a rut (some of the songs almost seem like the same concept, like ""Rock and Roll Hero"", ""Punk Rock Superstar"", and other lyrics that make you think of High School). There are a couple great songs here, but also too much fluff that sounds forced in order to fill out an album. Maybe a trip back to Memphis is needed."
4,As good as their other albums...maybe a little better.,"There's nothing radically different here with MP's latest. Same delightful sound, same great lyrics. If anything's different, it's that this album shows a little more wisdom than the first two. If you're an MP fan, you'll love this album. If you're familiar only with the radio hits, then this album is as good as place to start as any other MP album. Either way, you'll be happy."
1,poor product,i would recomend going to a local home center to purchase this type of product. If you have a problem and neeed to return it it will cost more that the price you pay for this.
5,Liftmaster 373LM,Originally I had a 20 year old Genie door opener on my home and a 5 year old Liftmaster door opener on a storage building. I upgraded the Genie opener with a Liftmaster 355LM receiver and purchased the Liftmaster 373LM remote for a third vehicle.The device works fine with both door openers.
5,Fast Service Great Price,I was amazed at how quickly the garage door opener came. The price was great on the three I bought as well. I had priced them at almost double elsewhere.
5,Works great with Craftsman garage door opener (Purple Learn button),"We have a Sears Craftsman garage door opener with a purple learn button (315MHz), and this LiftMaster remote worked perfectly and right away. Also, it has a very good range.The original remotes are $40 on the Sears website, so I saved more than $20 with it. My in laws need a couple of remotes for the same garage door opener, so I have a placed them an order for two of these.Recommended."
5,Works as Expected,Got this remote for a third vehicle and it works perfectly; just like the originals. Shipping was quick and I had absolutely no issues with the product or the seller.
5,3 Button Remote Control,This item worked great and came in less than 2 days from purchase time. It was easy to program and was exactly what I purchased. Thanks for a great buy.
5,Works Great,We wanted a remote control for each of the vehicles. This works perfectly. I did end up having to re-sync some of my old remotes at the same time however.
4,Garage door opener,"Simple set up so far, all is well with the extra openers. Works just like the OEM units I received with new opener installed prior. Great delivery time and price. Design is protected by mfg. otherwise price may be less and more brands offered in the future, thats my only reason for four stars. I super glued metal clip to plastic case so it won't fall off, just for my needs.Happy so far.."
5,Liftmaster 373LM Remote Control,"This remote control works great and is very easily programmed for one or two garage doors, with options for programming the garage door opener lights. Was reasonably priced by the Amazon.com affiliate that fulfilled the order--Cinderella's Cellar. Shipping time was satisfactory; and when notified that they had shipped the wrong model, they quickly sent the correct model without waiting for me first to return the wrong one they'd shipped."
5,It works!,It was easy to setup and works as expected. I would recommend to anyone needing a 3-button garage door opener.
5,Chamberlain LiftMaster 3-Button Remote works just as promised,"Our original Chamberlain LiftMaster Remotes became unusable after only 6 years of use. We decided to try the replacement remotes as we have had bad luck with universal remotes. The product arrived within a few days after ordering. It only took 5 minutes to program the remotes to our existing LiftMaster garage door openers and they have worked perfectly. Hopefully, they will last longer than the originals."
5,AWESOME,Programmed in less than 3 seconds and works from a further distance than the Craftsman remote it replaced...Extremely happy with this product
1,"Chamberlain LiftMaster 373LM 315Mhz 3-Button Remote Control (Purchased on June 17, 2012)",Both identical remotes didn't work. I had the correct serial numbers on the models and I tried several sets of new batteries.
1,"This is not a book, and is not worth the money.",Don't be fooled. This is not a book. It's a fold out cheat-sheet on glossy cardboard.
5,Excellent reference for SAP developers,I am an SAP developer. My productivity soared after acquiring this reference card. There is so much information at your fingertips. Seeing so many of the pieces of the SAP SD puzzle in one place is very beneficial.
5,A story that needed to be told...,"...and it is well done, by one of the ""Sisterhood."" Very engrossing, and goes to show how valuable their contributions were during wartime. They didn't just type and file papers--they were in the thick of it as well as the men. It's about time that their role was given the recognition it deserves!"
2,Valuable but sketchy,"I love the premise of this book, and I admit that I learned a lot from reading it. It reveals a part of OSS history that is not often explored in detail. The contributions of women to the wartime efforts of the OSS are impressive.I did not find the book easy going, though. There is no narrative. It's a string of anecdotes, often told backwards or sideways. The author skips around from telling us where the woman was from to telling us where she lived after she retired, then throws in a bit about what she did in the war, then skips to her husband's story, then back to the war, then maybe back to her early schooling. The reader is left dangling when important bits of the wartime history are simply omitted. Some stories are told in a way that only a WWII OSS enthusiast could make any sense out of them.I wish it had been better. These women are fast disappearing, and their stories need to be told in a better, more compelling way."
4,Sisterhood of Spies: Purchased at Amazon.com,"Sisterhood of Spies was a very different type of book for me to read. It is about men and women who served in the OSS; Office of Strategic Services during World War II. It was a good book, but with an awful lot of detail to read through. Mostly I read this book to see what women would be like as spies. Imagine my surprise when I read that Julia Child was working for the OSS, I think in China and met her future husband over there. In most ways this was a really good book, but be prepared to read through lots of information."
3,Women in World War II,"Elizabeth P. McIntosh does a good job of describing the structure and functions of the OSS. She does an even better job in the telling of the duties, trials, courage and contributions of the women who served with the OSS. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in WW2 and with espionage in particular."
2,MY GRADE: D plus to C minus,"There's some very interesting information in here about the formation of the OSS and particularly the women who were in it, including field agents and even a couple of celebrities like Julia Childs and Marlene Dietrich but the presentation is vapid and ponderous at best. It got to the point where I found myself skipping chapters and skimming others until I realized it was more interesting to dig this information up on Wiki. The patriotic tone may turn off a few people. And, before an Amazon troll steps in and tells me I can't rate something if I haven't read it the whole way through, well, you're just flat out wrong. It isn't my job to read through something if it's boring. That's the job of the author to get me to want to turn the next page. OVERALL GRADE: D plus to C minus; WHEN READ: March to April 2012."
4,Lolila,This is a beautiful fragrance. The company is sweet. They have lovely items. The perfume arrived in excellent condition. Thank you.
2,"...waiting, waiting, waiting AND more waiting!","We ordered the product on Mar 2 - it wasn't shipped until a week later on the 8th - we didn't receive the product until the Mar 24th. Not very happy with the amount of time we had to wait to get it.Sent an email to customer service, they did respond very quickly but offered no explanation why it took so long for the product to arrive. We are in Canada and the item was shipped from Seattle - should not have taken over 3 weeks to arrive.We're happy with the product but probably will pay more attention to who the seller is next time."
5,Vintage Stephen King,"Skeleton Crew is second only to Night Shift as my favorite among King's short story collections, and it's second by about inches. Great book! The novella ""The Mist"" starts this anthology off with just the right tone, and then tales like ""Nona"" ""The Reaper's Image"" and ""The Jaunt""--the only King story that ever really scared me--continue that nice touch of unreality. This is among King's best books of all time and would be a bargain at many times its price."
3,An alright book!,"I thought this was an alright book. The best storie in the book was ""The Raft."" My second favorite story was ""The Mist."" I also like ""The Monkey,"" ""Nona,"" and ""Survivor Type,"" was alright. Some other ones were good, but I forget the names. There are a few stupid stories though, like ""Gramma,"" ""The Reach,"" and ""The Ballod of ???."" An alright book that will pass time."
4,plenty of page-turning scary stuff,"I have not read a lot of Stephen King novels and Iactually don't like scary movies but somehow I foundthe short stories in here enjoyable.King has a cultural shorthand, a sort of jivey patterthat substitutes for real characterization - his writinghere is full of references to rock and roll songs of theperiod. If you know and like the song this createsa sense of identification with the character.I'm not really sure how you define horror fiction. PerhapsKing has defined his own brand of it. It's sort ofworking-class folk in a world of hidden supernaturaldread.I read this a long time ago. I think the story ""The Mist""was recently made into a film. It's a novella and it'sthe part of the book that stayed with me the longest."
4,Another Winner From Mr King,"While this collection of Stephen King tales may not be up there with the monumental collection NIGHT SHIFT, there are enough macabre pleasures to make this worth reading.By far the best of the tales is the first, the novella length THE MIST, a claustrophobic story of the survival of a small group trapped within a mist that contains creatures out of a Lovecraftian nightmare. A real page turner, which would make one hell of a movie. Other stories worth reading are the sci fi tale THE JAUNT, which has a cracking ending and THE BALLAD OF THE FLEXIBLE BULLET, a moving story of madness. Many of the others are good, but just do not come up to the standard of those three - and the poetry sections are something that I'm afraid we can do without."
4,About one short story in it.,"The Raft is the best story I ever read and the most disturbing one, too"
3,Hit and Miss,"The first story (or rather novella) in this books, 'The Mist' is amazing. Brilliantly scary, horrific and with the kinda of downbeat ending you love to hate it would make a brilliant straight to video B-movie! The rest of the stories are so-so. The Monkey is really a predictable, sentimental piece of cliche, Gramma is actually superb and very very frightening (it kind of reminded me of Georges Marvellous Medicine by Roald Dahl for some reason...) ummm Survivior Type is bleakly funny but the rest of the stories are bland and forgettable. However the Mist is worth the cover price alone and then some."
3,Not King's Best,"I picked this novel up and decided to save it, Stephen King I have found is like a candy, something that should be stored and savoured.The first story in this collection ""The Mist"" is in my opinion the best. It is classic King - slow in its rise before the true nature of a terror is known, terrifying and possibly (though not as plausible as The Stand) real. Other stories are quite good, such as ""The Word Processor of the Gods"" (immediately comes to mind).Overall however, I must say this is not my favourite piece of his work. Of his other short story/novella collections, I enjoyed Four Seasons, Night Shift and Four Past Midnight more. Many of these stories are either less polished, less frightening or worst of all less interesting than I have come to expect of Stephen King.Nevertheless this is Stephen King. Although this might be my least favourite piece of his, it is his still his, he is a master storyteller. These just happen to be some of his lesser stories."
4,Scary Stuff,"Skeleton Crew is another great collection of short stories by horror master Stephen King. Every original story is premised on ideas that would scare the pants off any child: from freaky death monkey toys to witch possessed grandmas to flesh-consuming oil spills. The overall atmosphere of unbridged terror is, of course, executed to perfection by King."
4,Worth It,"I'm not a big fan of King's short stories. They never seem as effective as his novels. I do own this collection though for the short novel called The Mist that is contained within. This is a fantastic story, and I find it hard to believe that this has not been mined by Hollywood for a movie. The rest of the collection is very hit or miss."
2,horrible!,"This book was horrible, the only decent story was the one about the killer toy monkey. And that wasnt even that good!!"
1,skeleton crew,I thought the book was not very good at all. The worst thing was it was boring. It was boring because there was not alot of action. It also was disgusting some what.The part that was disgusting was when the guy was dreaming about his wife and his kid getting cut by the window shattering in the store. The way he described it made it seem disgusting. I did not like the book.
1,disc issues but nice enough to give refund,"I love scooby doo, and got this, but the disc was crap. It skips and freezes all the time. Worth the money, but not worth the trouble. It almost ruined my dvd player because it kept getting stuck. But I WILL say that goHastings, who I bought the movie from, gave me a refund because of my trouble. I do thank them for that."
3,7keto,I don't know if this product is really working because I have not lost any weight. Could be because I am very stress and eating out alot.
3,not overly impressed,broken in the box. embarrassing when my mother opened it up as a gift and pieces fell into her lap. maybe it happened in transit but i was fairly displeased nonetheless.
5,Stopped using my electric razor,"I had been using an electric razor for a while to keep my skin from getting irritated, but occasionally I would use a Mach 3 to get a more ""clean"" feeling. I thought at first that the M3 Power was just a gimmick, and when I first took it out of the box, I thought so even more (you push a button, and the whole thing vibrates). But somehow, it works! This thing gives an amazingly close shave, and I notice NO irritation. I've stopped using my electric razor and now use the M3 Power pretty much every day."
2,"OK, but...","One would hope for more than just a compilation of music videos and a few stray bits of material. The Palm Director Series started off with a bang (see the excellent, truly excellent Michel Gondry Director's Series DVD), and has degenerated into formula...throw down a bunch of music videos, go get a few musician soundbites, take the customer's money. No real insight here into Sednaoui, but then again, maybe there's nothing to see."
4,Great for small parties,I use this product for a small DJ business. It was compatible with my current sound system and is very user friendly. I would recommend to anyone who is just starting out. It is a very good learning system.
1,good idea bad product,paid under 300 for a product taht was damaged durning shipping and would not even trun on when i contacted customer service they offered me a replacement but i refused in fear of the same thing happening so i went with zzsound.com. the product its self is very limited the only posative i saw in it is the abiltiy to mix cds but any most computers and programs now adays are cheaper and more effective. my advice is give this item serious thought and research because there are other options and products out there.
2,no game descriptions,My son loves these games and we have many of them. I would be interested in purchasing this IF I knew which games were included
4,mozart the great,"I heard other recordings of Mozart's k 310-none of them were so powerful and touching as Gilels'performance.Mozart and the other composers seem to be playing through Gilels. Sometimes I was distracted by the coughing and sneezing-some of those people sounded like they should have been in a hospital, not a theatre!-but the music is so great I could still listen spellbound."
3,coughing and sneezing,"All the tracks are live, with a lot of distracting coughing and even sneezing. What a shame. The performances are otherwise quite first-rate."
1,young good looking and cant act,This film introduces itself like a reality TV show. : the teams dumped in the desert with survival tasks to compete with Meanwhile keeping us guessing who will shag who and the casting has filtered out people with normal bodies as if that toned is normal.Oh yawn and I couldn't give a damn. to watch the rest of it.
5,My husband loves this watch!,"I got the ESQ watch for my husband for fathers day. I wanted to get him a nice watch that he could wear to work. I was nervous because he is very particular.Well, I am very pleased with my purchase and then some. It is a very handsome watch. The diamonds are really nice against the dark face and the watch looks very well made but, best of all, my husband loves it."
5,Excellent work,The best work of one of the best music videos director. I recommend this Dvd.Saludos desde Ecuador!!!
5,This book is Great,This book is superb. I've read vol1 and vol2. Books on programming are generally boring but this one is an exception. Bruce's style of relating programming concepts with real world and his lucid explanation will make you read complete book once you start reading it. Anyone seriously interested in knowing C++ in depth should have this book.
3,"May be a good start for C developers, but not for 4GL folks.","First of all, I should not that I haven't get this book yet. I'am reading PDF versions of both Volume 1 and 2. If you are experienced in C but a novice developer for OO world this is one of the best books available to start with. On the contrary, if your experiences coming from a 4GL tool (PowerBuilder, Centura/SQLWindows, Delphi, VB...) you may get confused with the many recalls from C (SmallTalk and Java). Besides Volume 2 , which is not published yet, contains much more valuable stuff if your mission statement is ""I know object orientation, but wanna learn how it's implemented with C++ and in STL"". I probably wait for the second volume and buy that one, but use PDF for this one."
1,As clear as mud explanation,"The authors' explanations are so wordy and misleading that even some simple stuffs, which can be easily explained, become very confusing for the readers. This is the worst C++ book that I have read. I would rather picking no star if I could."
2,Not what I expected,"This book is for those that have an understand of the C language as stated in the preface ""I decided to assume that someone else had taught you C and the you have at least a reading level of comfort with it"". I would recommend Sam's Teach Yourself C++ over this book if you are like me and looking to jump into C++ and have no programming experience."
2,Not for newbies,This book is definately not for newcomers to VC++. I am a 13 and started reading this book and it wasn't for me. I have very good experience in Visual Basic 6 and a good knowledge in Java. I decided to come to C++ and writing the code wasn't difficult with online tutorials.This book is for intermediate to experienced C++ programmers with some knowledge of C. This book doesn't cover how to use the user interface just the syntax of VC++.If you know of a good book that explains how to use the user interface in detail would you please E-mail me.
5,The Best Book for Learning C++,"After reading a number of tutorial books on C++ I found Thinking in C++. I wish I had found it earlier because in my view it has the easiest to understand explanations of any book I've seen. I write C++ programs for a living and still use this book along with Vol. 2 as a reference. Of course I also use The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup as a reference, but sometimes he is pretty hard to understand so I turn to Bruce Eckel for a simpler explanation."
2,Looking for a Good C++ Tutorial for C Programmers?,"As a C programmer, I purchased ""Thinking in C++"" to learn OOP and C++, but I'm sadly disappointed. I find the book very wordy and poorly organized, and the gradeschool-style of large type makes reading it even more difficult. And you can forget about using the book as a reference, as clear definitions are difficult to find. The CD-ROM may be helpful to beginning programmers, but don't expect too much from it. And realize (arrgh) that you have to use Microsoft products exclusively to run the CD! On the plus side, the book contains lots of code examples showing how to use the language attributes, which is very helpful.If you like a fluffy, narrative style of writing then perhaps you'll like this book, but most readers will find the book to be like wading through molasses."
3,"Good content, haphazard presentation","The content of this book is definately top notch, however presentation of this material isn't ideal for a computer novice. Not to say its unreadable, but it leaves some gaps. Additionally the premise that a reader should program C before tackling C++ [while being one that most colleges believe in..ahem..more classes = more $$$] it is not one that I believe in. Sec"
4,Great way to improve your programming skills,Thinking in C++ is quite different from other C++ books. It's for experienced programmers and contains a lot of useful and advanced topics. The book printing is quite disappointing though..
5,Fabulous Book for learning C++,"When I first picked this book up, I did not knowanything about C++ or object-oriented programming.Now that I have finished the book and used C++in my projects at work, It almost seems likeI always must have known C++.This book is terrific. When reading the book,you can tell that Eckel was an experienced andeffective C++ teacher before he wrote this book.He knows where students get confused and does agreat job at explaining those points clearly.After you learn C++ using this book and you wantto express yourself fully, I recommend""Thinking in C++, Volumn 2""."
4,Finally I understand C++ (and a lot more OOP),"I thought I knew C++ well, until I read this book. This is really a great book. While learning more of the C++ programming language, I also learned more of Object Oriented Programming. This book doesn't only show HOW the language works, but also WHY it works like it does. It shows alot of what happens ""under the hood"". There are also alot of examples where he shows how C++ differ in some aspects than C, and also the C++ equivalent of some old C stuff. The exercises at the end of each chapters are also very good. If I have to choose a negative point of the book (only if someone put a gun to my head), it would be that the chapters are a bit long. But hey, if you're a C++ programmer and haven't read this book yet, buy it now, you won't regret it."
4,Better than most other C++ books,"This book is an excellent guide to C++ for those with a good knowledge to C. Even though the author tries to convince you that knowledge of C isn't necessary for following the book, i think it will be great help if you could first get some idea of C before you read this one.The way the author introduces the various features of C++ is great. For example, the way he introduces classes from structures is commendable. I havent seen any other book that has done a similar treatment.The book is mostly practical advice on C++ programming. As and when new features are introduced, common pitfalls of using the feature are discussed. Also some good guidelines are provided as to how to use the feature.Overall, a good book! You wont repent spending your hard earned bucks on this one!"
3,"Good for the beginners,but...","I waited for this book with great expectations but in the end it felt short of my thoughts. This book should have been named ""Learning C++"" rather than ""Thinking in C++ "" because it doesn't really teach you how to think in C++. The most problematic aspects of the language and of the OO programming are hardly covered. I still don't know well the difference between containment and aggregation , virtual inheritance is hardly mentioned as well as multiple inheritance. I recommand it but only for the beginners"
5,Very wordy.,"This is a good book for C++. The text is large(size wise) and very readable. The only complaint might be that it is very wordy.Meaning that you do not compile and run any code to about page 94. The two books could be combined into one.But the explanations are clear and the problems are workable. Although it is wordy, I gave it 5 stars."
5,JUST PERFECT !!!!,This is one of the best books in C++. It starts with the basic differences and similarities with C and then proceeds on to C++. It covers everything from simple concepts to major topics in perfect clarity. I use it as my companion in my CS course 1st year at Uni and it's great. Anything you ask will be here in detail. Recommended to anyone serious in C++
4,very pleasant reading,"This is a book that covers c++ almost from scratch. I've had no other programming experience than some php and a tiny bit of C before I read this book. It is a real nice introduction both to the language c++, but most important, it is an introduction to the mindset of object oriented programming, it has some real good chapters in the beginning detailing different processes to begin and plan a project in an object oriented fashion."
5,Great gentle reading.,"I love books about how ordinary people found thier way across our country. Most of all I like to hear about how they overcame the hard times. When you read about some of the hardships they had it makes your own problems seem rather small. It is hard today to find good wholesome books that have no explicit sex, violence, or foul language. I found these to be very entertaining, calming books to relax with."
5,Excellent product if you like a low toilet,"My wife and I are relatively short, and we find the new ADA (AKA ""comfort height"") toilets to be too tall and therefore uncomfortable to sit on.If you are NOT looking for an extra-high or ADA compliant toilet, you can't do better than this Toto toilet.The seat dampers are a nice feature, as well. They allow you to put down the seat or the lid without them slamming."
4,Good Overall,"This toilet looks and feels great!We bought this toilet to replace another brand that was always stopping-up. This TOTO rarely stops up. However, when it does stop-up, the toilet is usually impossible to unstop with simple plunging, even when the load is light. (We have tried many different plungers operated by some very strong people.) Unstopping usually requires an overnight soak with baking soda and vinegar to loosen the clog before the plunger will work."
1,It shoots stuff back at you!,"I have heard that toto is the best, but this toto toilet actually throws poop back at you when if flushes. This toilet looks like it is for the oompa loompa's. It is so small. It also doesn't hold much water at all. I am not satisfied at all with this toto model!It has gotten to be the family joke because it is such a conversation piece. Everyone who uses it comments on it as they laugh. It must have been made for a small person. Maybe it is good for a child's toilet. It is ridiculous! Of course, who will take back a toilet? So, we are stuck with it. The site also says free super saver shipping but charges $50 and there is no way around this. Additionally, you cannot place anything on the toilet tank because it is not flat. A huge problem with me! No tissues will sit back there or extra toilet paper. My bathroom doesn't have any toilet paper storage. Totally not satisfied!"
5,one and done...as it should be,"A toilet is not just a toilet. Our new Toto is a water saver that not only flushes completely first time/every time, it somehow needs cleaning less often as well. I think the quality of the finish leaves a longer lasting clean. What more could you want from a toilet?"
2,"cap broken in two years, leak noticed at 3rd year","First time I use Toto, after two years the cap ear broken due pull up wire too thin and rubber too soft. There are two ears so I use another one in center and drill a hole.after sewer changed to ABS at 3rd party I noticed even the toilet works fine there is drip every second - it may drip since new but most won't notice, unless you work close to abs pipe in a quiet basement like me."
4,"Great look, good performance, not so quiet","This is a great contemporary style, and the low flow usage is amazing. Only negative is the giant gurgle in the flush; I'd hoped for a smoother, quieter performance."
2,Arrived damaged,"Damage must be a really common problem for this product. In my case there is a crack that the installer found. I am lucky to have this discovered during the return window, but still lots of hussle: return, find another one, re-arrange installation...."
2,A Waste,Advertised and recommended for superior flushing. Double or more the price of standard units at Home Depot. Not discernibly better at dealing with my high fiber diet.
4,Young Energy for Old Standards,"It seems strange to be recommending anything originating from Sea Cliff, New York, but Repertoire is a well-crafted CD of jazz, pop, and fusion, bringing some fresh young energy to some old standards such as ""Let's Face the Music and Dance."" Dunham's voice ranges wide as she covers these songs, and the accompaniment is provided by established jazz players such as Phil Woods and Harvie Swartz. The recording is first-rate, a studio job all the way, but excellent of its kind."
5,First Aid for USMLE-Q&A,"This is a great resource for boards prep. It breaks down questions by organ system, has a large ""practice test"", and has some basic science sections too. Its nice because you can review a specific organ system or area and then quiz yourself with questions directed toward that specific area too."
2,Not a great book,THis book has to be one of my worst buys for Step 1 study.The material did not reflect the exam and many questions were much easier than the actual exam.I would suggest using USMLEworld instead...much more reflective in terms of the Step Exams
5,red mouse pad,"its a mouse pad ok, its great if you want a mouse pad. if your looking for a matress its not good"
1,you sent the wrong perfume,"you have sent us perfume when we clearly ordered aftershave, as is shown by your picture. we have now sent it back, but have recieved nothing in return, it has now been some weeks and have heard nothing! It was a birthday present for my father and we are really upset as this money was not easy to come by.We would be very pleased for an end to this matter, and would look forward to a reply.Thank-you."
5,"Finally, real help for management issues!","I throughly enjoyed this book. More importantly I found easy to understand and easy to implement strategies to help me manage and lead people to the levels of productivity that I knew they were capable! I know that others must need and want help with the issues that we all deal with managing and motivating people today. This is what everyone has been looking for.Kim Ward's conversational and entertaining approach to explaining not only the issues, but his common sense instructions to solutions make this the most useful and valuable decision and management tool I've seen to date!I'm thrilled to have found such a ""grass roots"" solutions approach for current everyday problems."
4,Good rainy day workout,"I think the video is pretty well done for what it is, and a well spent hour. I do like the explanations that Chris Carmichael provides on what is being done, and why. I think this one is a little harder than the CTS Climbing Workout because it requires three power intervals that, if done properly, will wipe you out. At the end of the video, Chris suggests a 'bonus' power interval or two because all did so well. NOT!!"
3,Boring but effective,"Ok - I've used other training videos that are more exciting and easier to follow, such as Spinervals. Chris Carmichael puts me to sleep, and he constantly talks about how ""Lance does it."" So the video itself is a snooze fest and Carmichael doesn't appear to have much of a personality, but he does know how to train champions. The workout is very good and you'll find yourself getting stronger in no time."
3,not for a beginner,"i am very new to belly dance. i have only been practicing for 3 months now. i do like zoe's style i bought this set based on the reviews that said alot of the drills were useful. being very new to this dance form, i can not use these dvd's. im keeping them in the hopes that i will be able to use this further down the road in my practice. the drills are not broken down enough for someone with no experience, like myself. so if you are thinking about this set and are a beginner like myself, i would hold off until you have more skills under your belt. i was disappointed, but im hoping to use this set soon. i bought sadies cd and that one has been very good for my level."
1,Spider in the Sink,"One of the most worthless books I've ever read-and I don't ask much from pulp mysteries. What's with this chick?!? She meets this preacher who almost minute one inexplicably starts talking of wanting to marry her, and even though she seems to barely like him she considers it ... over and over again?!? Even if she did like him, what kind of fool must she be to seriously think of marrying someone she has had so little actual contact with?!? His actions were so bizarre at times that any sane person would be running for the nearest exit. Their whole interaction was ridiculous. As were the antics of the schoolgirls. Do not waste a single second on this book! I only gave it 1 star because there wasn't a lower option."
3,Grumpy!,"THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!I have been excited to see this movie ever since it came out in theaters but didn't get a chance until now. And I really enjoyed it....most of it. But I am now sitting her in shock, and a little grumpy, because that movie was NOT a romantic comedy. I cried my eyes out. I just want to warn viewers like myself (who still really liked it and would have watched it anyway) that this movie is not a romantic comedy. But I thought it was well done and I loved the romance between Emma and Dex."
2,Disappointed,"Sorry I have to say I was disappointed in this film. Without giving away the ending, I can't say why!"
3,Watching a train wreck,"This was a beautiful movie and yet I will never watch it again. It was like watching a train wreck. You know, you see it coming and yet you still keep watching! They ended as if something was not finished. To realistic and painful for me and yet beautiful all at the same time. Are you confused yet? Goodness knows I am."
4,Lasting love.,"One Day starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess is a beautiful love story. I have also read the book prior to seeing the movie, the guy who wrote the book also wrote the screenplay, it's a faithful adaptation...stays true to the deep and chaotic friendship/relationship between Dex and Emma. I thought Hathaway was an excellent choice to play Emma, she really brings out Emma's sarcastic, slightly insecure nature while Sturgess brings out Dex's womanizing and yet kind-hearted playful banter. Dex is not very likable in the beginning but you really feel towards the middle of the film, he's a good guy...he's just a little misguided. Parts of the film felt rushed to me, whereas the book gives a lot more space and we get to see Dex and Emma's deep love for each other. Beautiful film if you enjoy romantic dramas (like I do), give it a try!"
4,Bittersweet story of enduring love,"So many years of annual reunions to rekindle a love that somehow is allowed to lapse while life goes on.With all the struggles and success they each encounter, the one thing that endures is the tender moments these two have shared. It makes you wonder if they will ever get together for a lasting relationship as they meander over the years, without each other. The interaction between these two is quirky and romantic and it develops more intensity over time although they always regard each other as special friends. I loved the dialog, the looks they gave each other, and joy they conveyed while together. But throughout the story was a sadness and longing for them to be together, never knowing how it might turn out. I especially enjoyed seeing Anne Hathaway in a role as a Brit. I thought she seemed very convincing with her demeanor, accent and all."
1,Disappointed,"I rented this movie for my wife and myself because I saw romantic comedy. It should have been categorized as romantic depressive. I realize the previous reviewers love this movie based upon prior knowledge of the book etc. The movie matches their description. All that I am saying is that it is not a romantic comedy, so if that is what you are looking for, then don't bother with this movie."
4,Love & Tragedy!!,The movie made you realized that don't take love for granted because you will never know what will happen in the future.
4,"If you can relate, this is a really good movie.","Once again, all I want to do is give this movie a rating to get better recommedations, but Amazon is hiding the rating system inside the movie's info page. Please bring back the rating system, Amazon. I don't want to have to write a review to improve my recommendations."
5,A+ movie,This movie was really good. It kept you guessing and had a good ending. I liked how it was kind of a timeline of their relationship. Hathaway was amazing in this movie. I loved that it was set in England. Definitely worth buying. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
2,"Boring, dull, and slow...","Couldn't finish the book, don't know why I thought the movie would be tolerable. I ended up watching the whole thing, but not in one sitting."
3,great book ok movie,"I rented this movie because i read the book.. i loved the book which was way better it develops the characters more and makes a great book the movie left out a lot of key moments in the book that make the story really great, i feel like the book had too much to put into a movie.. i thought the movie was ok but i recommend you read the book"
1,One Star Too Many,Send this to the MCA graveyard. I've seen many Anne Hathaway films and loved her. This film was a waste of reel time and actors energy.
1,One LOOONNNGG Boring Day!,"This movie was so awful I felt compelled to warn others off of it. Hathaway's accent is cringingly embarrassing and distracting. Patricia Clarkson is a fine, lovely actress, but again the accent is horrific. Are there no British actresses? Other reviewers have covered all the defects of this film in better and more detail than I will here. Suffice it to say it's boring, tedious, and silly. The characters have zero chemistry, no charisma, or any true redeeming qualities. I didn't care whatsoever that Hathaway's character died. By the end of this travesty, I wanted to run them all over myself."
2,Again?!,"The film could have been better, and more successful, if the people who make films took the time to find out what people like AND DON'T LIKE in a film. After being victimized by The Good Heart, I've tried to avoid the same happening again, but you just don't see it coming. (There, no spoiler!)The acting was fine, btw."
2,Formulaic,"Spolier alert! Don't read if you don't want to know what happens to Emma!I was disappointed that this was just another spin on the old, old, very old plot of two people falling madly in love only so that one of them can be creamed by an oncoming truck (or die of consumption, or whatever). What a waste of time...to become emotionally involved in these two only to watch one of them die violently right in the middle of the story. It doesn't even seem worth it...Emma dies so that...what...Dex gets to finally ""grow up?"" Gimme a break already! If I had known it was one of those movies, I wouldn't have bothered!"
1,Terrible movie,"This was one of those movies where the best part of the movie was the trailer! We got 25 minutes into it, and just turned it off. No plot. All sexual jokes. (I have no problem with that--just make it part of the story!) No character development. No action. In one scene, he had to hurry to catch the plane to India and in the next scene he was in Paris. Just sloppy.I wish I could get my money back...and my time."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,OMG was this boring. A lame british version of when harry met sally. There was no climax and it was very predictable. Total snoozefest
2,One Day,To me this movie was extremely sad and disturbing... if I look at it objectively... it is a lesson on how not to live your life... For myself... this movie is an absolute waste of my time!!! I would not recommend it to anyone who has any sort of moral fiber...
1,A present for my wife.,I bought this for wife so I can't comment sorry. I hate Anne Hathaway and her stupid fish slapped lips and big alien eyes. No way is that her real name either. I mean an actress in the 21st Century with the same name as Shakespeare's wife. No way.
1,Most depressing movie ever!,"Are you looking for a beautiful love story with two imperfect people who end up happily ever after? This is not quite that. Think more of a romantic tragedy, on par with Shakespeare."
3,A little long...,"And boring. It jumped around so much that I never did feel a connection with the characters or the plot. After the ""climax"" the movie still kept moving along through 2 or 3 more years. Ugh."
1,DEPRESSING!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!! IT IS NOT A ROMANTIC COMEDY! IT IS SOOOOOOO DEPRESSING! don't waste your time on this piece of junk! they are good actors, but the storyline sucks, because they do not end up together. When they are not together in the movie, the other parts bore your socks off. It just goes from bad to worse. I don't know how the critics can call this a romantic comedy! It makes me really mad when they say ""Romantic comedy"" on the back of the movie and then it is not even romantic! They do that for lots of bad movies."
1,One Day,"Why can't we have a sweet story that isn't all about immorality. This could have been done so much better. Hollywood do you have to have to smut to sell all the time? It was slow, boring and unmeaningful. What a waste of time. Should have turned it off, but kept hoping it would get better."
3,Wonderful story,"This wads wonderful movie about true friends and true love. Anne Hathaway was wonderful with her British accent. The movie was different and surprising. Get your tissues, because you will need them."
3,WHAT?!?,"So, I knew nothing of the story line other than it was a romance set over time. I have a completely free weekend to catch up on movies so I'm like ""hey, I like Ann Hathaway. Why not see this movie?"" I liked it enough - up until the ending. I won't ruin it for you, but don't rent this if you're in the mood for a classic hollywood happy ending. On the other hand, if you're in the mood for a more realistic/tragic love story then this is perfect. Note: If I wanted to see tragic endings I have nothing more to do than to look around. Movies that leave you with a sad feeling, or shall we say a more ""analytical reflective feeling,"" can be just fine... I just wish I would have known that was what I was getting from the beginning."
2,Book was so much better than the movie,"I had high hopes for this movie because the book was great. I was so disappointed I had to force myself to get through the entire movie. The accents are so horrible, so fake. The only thing I liked was the scenery of the countryside. Otherwise, the book did a better job unfolding the wole story. You are better off buying/reading the book."
1,YUCK,"Boring...... horrible British accents....dull characters. I have to admit, I got this because of Hathaway, but I couldn't even finish the movie. Very disappointed in her decision to do this movie. Times must be tough."
1,Nauseating,It was a terribly boring and slow movie. Couldn't sitck with it to the end. It was a display of the lack of creativity and morals of the European culture. Well displayed was the decay of the European mindset to a society growing ever more heartless and irresponsibly self-centered.
3,Sweet and sad,"I couldn't bring myself to giving this four stars, but it is a pretty good movie, but not great. Anne Hathaway is wonderful in it, but if you are looking for an uplifting or inspiring love story, this is probably not what you are looking for."
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"I like a good romantic movie, and I thought this would fit the bill. There is some romance, but you have to go through an awful lot of crap before you actually get to the good part, which is roughly in the last 20 minutes of the movie. And then, the good part is extremely abrupt! Suddenly, I was shocked to learn that there is a twist that turns this film into a tearjerker! I don't really want to sit there on a plane, crying over some sad movie. It had some good points, but I think they should put a warning on it that it's not all sunshine and roses. I might have still watched it at another time, but it would have been nice to know what I was in for because I'm not one to purposefully watch a sad movie. So my advice: watch at your own emotional risk!"
2,Don't waste your time,"First of all, I didn't read the book on which the movie is based, so my judgment of the film is based simply on the film itself.I get the whole premise that we are seeing only a ""slice of life"" in the lives of this couple--one day each year. And yet, I felt like I missed something important that must have happened during the intervening 364 days. Throughout, we hear them say what good friends they are, but I'm left scratching my head as to how they became friends. Much less how they fell in love.On a more positive note, the lead actors are beautiful people and it was nice watching them. Umm...that's about it.Seriously, don't waste your time on this movie."
2,Depressing,"Funny dialogue, if you can hear it. Anne's British accent verges on Irish at times. Its frustrating and then sad and then sadder... If you want to cry or just feel depressed, go for it."
2,One Dimensional,"One dimensional, no subtlety in the performance which made the characters fall flat in my opinion. Redundant scenes, disappointing ending made it feel like a complete waste of a potentially rich story plot. Fell far short of a success."
1,One Day....One Star....,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as I enjoy watching Anne Hathaway and love a good romance. From the start it looked pretty good and the premise of their first (remembered) encounter in July 15 1988 and peeking in on the same date through the years was a an interesting idea. Somehow, the movie seemed likable but disjointed, as you only had a bit of insight into what had happened the entire year before. I found it especially hard at the end to feel anything but disappointed. My husband and I both looked at each other, shook our heads and said nearly in unison ""Worst movie, EVER"".Overall, I am not quite sure who may like this movie, like I said I enjoy a good romance, but this just isn't one I could recommend."
3,"A good work, whose magic can't totally be taken away","I enjoyed most of this translation, but I noticed some sections that I found to be incorrect. The strongly disagree with the translation from ,I believe, the Fourth Chapter- ""I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before God."" I feel this to be incorrect because the Chinese tradition does not have an idea of a capital G god who is the ruler of the universe. I suppose from a pantheistic standpoint this translation could be more accurate, but to most first time readers this will sound as if it is talking about the Judeo-Christian god. I hope those who get this translation because of its low price will read on the internet or download audio files to supplement this reading to get a better understanding of the original work."
3,A King James Version of the Tao Te Ching,"You get what you pay for. This version is a modern update of an 1891 translation of the Tao Te Ching. It suffers from the same defects that ails the King James Version of the Bible. Only purists will go through the linguistic contortions to read it. This version does include a commentary to explain each chapter, but it does little to bring the text alive for modern readers. The Tao Te Ching doesn't need to be dissected, it needs to be experienced. Part of its magic comes from its rare combination of profound simplicity. In this translation, the magic is gone."
3,Path of Virtue if yur eyesight is good,"This a beautiful little book with the emphasis on little. The illustrations are old oriental paintings and are beautiful. The translation is poetical without giving much additional insight into the Tao Tai Ching. My primary problem with the book is that I cannot read it without aid of a magnifying glass. Though of a certain age, I generally do not have problems reading anything (except the finer print on contracts). For those computer literati, imagine a font size of 6, maybe less. It is a pretty coffee table book for those with better eyes."
1,Not very helpful,"I found this translation to be unusable. Passages that were easy to understand in every other translation turned into gibberish in this one. I know nothing about the quality of the scholarship, but this was virtually unreadable and I gave it away to Goodwill."
2,19th century translation of Warring Kingdoms volume,"James Legge (1815-1897) is all you need to know about this translation. This thoroughly Victorian volume was one of 50 books in the Sacred Books of the East Series which Legge (and Max Mueller) translated into quaint missionary English. Legge's work lies entirely in the public domain, can also be found at Project Gutenberg, and in modern history is one of those antique but praiseworthy free texts that find themselves constantly dragooned into electronic book readers. There are several excellent modern translations of the Tao Te Ching, written by scholars for whom Classical Chinese is, as it were, an open book. Not recommended. Legge's missionary style is occasionally prudish or even deliberately obscurantist, although for the time and place it stands as a monumental beginning in Western sinology."
1,What the heck?,"After downloading this and beginning to read it, I thought ""Wait, did I open the right book?"" Really, it is that bad. I have had a copy of the Tao on my bookshelf forever, and this aint the Tao - LOL! Wordy, kinda like an annotated edition with the annotations as part of the text.I agree with the other review. This ain't even worth $0.99!~_~"
3,"Great book, not so good translation","I love this book and have read many versions. This translation seems to be very different and has some additions that I'm not sure belong. Maybe a good thing, maybe a bad thing. Just not what I was expecting but still a good read."
2,"Was looking for a translation of the Tao Te Ching, not an interpretation","This is a long interpretation of the Tao Te Ching, not a simple straightforward translation. For a very clean, elegant and clear translation, I thoroughly recommend ""Tao Te Ching (Kindle Edition) by Burton Watson"" instead - seeTao Te Ching(Burton Watson translation for Kindle)"
3,It's Alright,"I suppose if you can't get your hands on any other translations, this one will do. It's alright, in the sense that it does follow along with the original stories rather well.The main problem, to me, is that different languages need to be represented differently. You can't take a Chinese book and translate it, expecting it to stay true to its beauty in English. I found this book to be a bit dry, and I lost interest in it rather easily.If you're looking for a translation that doesn't strictly adhere to the Chinese version, but interprets it, flowing into a gorgeous English version, I suggestTao Te Ching: An Illustrated Journeyby Stephen Mitchell."
5,It's great,I know the man personally and never knew he wrote a book till just recently and I learned it from his sister he is a good man that was caught in a bad war. He didn't write this book to talk about himself if that was the type of man he is I would have heard about it from him.
2,A Troubling Read,"Let me qualify this by saying, there may be a context in which this book is not a waste of money and time. If you are new to running or have never considered the idea that there is a spiritual side to running or if you are new to the idea of meditation than this hackneyed over wrought phoney-boloney (he claims that the journal passages are actaully from his journal) book is for you. I found it to be fairly contrived. I found it impossible to buy into his journey. It read like an exercise manual for the soul with all the grace and diginity of a photo set explanation of the squat, cold and without life. I imagine if you enjoy things like that, it just wasn't good. I would recommend, Running and Being by Dr. George SHeehan. Thats personal, that invites you in to the good Doctor's life. Even Thomas Merton and then a good long distance run."
5,It changed my approach to running,The personal view into Roger Joslin's life added new life to my running. In this world of ego goals this book has the power to inject a positive new dimension to running and training. I thoroughly enjoyed savoring this book.
5,Great as toy or collectible,Fine quality item for both a child or adult collector. Unbelievably great price w/good shipping policy too.
2,Please spare yourself this toy -- it's terrible.,"This pool is a good concept. The hose attaches under the pool, shooting swirls of water into the air. The water collects in the pool, so it's a two-for-the-price-of-one. Right?NO. The sprinkler and hose connections have to be held on with zip-ties so they won't slip off. The connection that goes into the sprinkler head leaks badly, so the ""geyser"" only goes up 18 inches. This could be forgiven if the material that makes up the pool part wasn't so flimsy that it got leaks and collapsed within a few days. My kids are bummed, and I'm out a chunk of money.Save the [...] and get something else."
2,Would have been fun,"We purchased this pool for my son. It would have been fun if it hadn't come with a hole in it. The included patch kit didn't work. We returned it to the store where we purchased it and exchanged it for the last pool in stock--which ended up having two holes. We've tried silicon sealant and plastic patches, and duct tape.Despite the fact that it didn't hold water, my son enjoyed it. He's too young to be picky, I guess."
5,Very cool!,This toy was a great way to introduce my little ones to water play. They had so much fun and it lasted all season! Absolutely amazing! Thanks a bunch!!
2,Spotty Research,"I am in the middle of this book just because I hate to start something and not finish it and although it appears to be exhaustively researched and written I have come across some glaring errors that throw the whole book into question for me: in the photo section she captions a photo of Lillian with Hollywood producer Hal B. WALLACE - shouldn't it be Wallis? And in the section about Lillian's first stay in Hollywood she lists Mae West as a ""Kansas City runaway who starred in Hell's Angels"" - doesn't she mean Jean Harlow? These are such simple facts to get right it makes me wonder about the rest of the author's research and fact checking skills . . . So I am giving it two stars for now . . ."
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I bought this used and i'm glad I did. I wasn't completly happy with it. The book seemed to be a quick insight of Vivien Leigh's life. Also I was aware she did alot of Shakespeare play's but I thought it focused alot on this soley. Yes, it's good to know, but I like books that focus on ""the life"" of a star not more on the play's. I almost couldn't keep up with all the traveling talk either. Just happy I didn't spend the actuall cost of this book."
2,MORE OF THE SAME,"This book have nothing new to offer the same thing as the others book plus few mistake like he said jean pierre aumont and his wife tina were doing a show his wife name is marisa pavan still alive today and twin sister of pier angeli, tina is his daugther with maria montez many in correct thing in this book"
3,Only Fair,"I really like the cover photo of this book. However, the other photosare not high quality printing. It looks like a photocopied book of another book The text is interesting too read I don't think the use of profanity in the book is necessary at all. Vivien Leigh is a complex, beautiful person and this book barely does justice to her."
4,A worthy successor to Million Lights,"I'll get this tidbit out of the way: Million Lights is T21's best album, 2nd only to The Cure's Disintegration on my list of all-time favorites. That being said, Works heads in more of a commercial-sounding direction. Heavier drums guitar solos and more traditional rock arrangements make for a completely different mood this time around. I don't have too many complaints about this album. The percussion, at times, can sound a bit dated, and a couple of the instrumentals border on mediocre, but there are definitely some T21 classics on here. Tracks such as ""The Golden Age"", ""Betrayed"", and ""The Missing Piece"" helped me embrace the 'harder' sound of this CD, and the live version of ""Joh'Burg"" was a nice addition, though I'd rather T21 release the whole Official Bootleg recording on its own CD! Oh yeah, ""War Outside"" is an excellent instrumental. A must-buy for T21 fans, and a good chance to take for the casual listener."
5,Republished: A Girl and Five Brave Horses,A Girl and Five Brave HorsesThis is a very touching book of a woman and her exciting life. Sonora Carver has been an inspiration to many people. The republished book is as good as the original. My only problem with the republished book is the picture on the cover. It's not the original cover photo and the photo has nothing to do with a diving horse. Sonora was a great woman and I'm so glad that I now own my own copy of this wonderful book. I'm happy that others will discover the story of Sonora and the people who have wanted this book for so long will now have the opportunity to purchase it.
1,I AM DISGUSTED WITH AMAZON FOR SUPPORTING THE SALE OF THIS BOOK,"The Gates of Janus: Serial Killing and Its AnalysisI bet Amazon does not have the guts to publish this. Anyone who supports Brady's coffers by buying this book is as bad as Brady himself. He was a serial killer of little children and has no remorse. Why would anyone see him profit? I am disgusted, Amazon."
2,Not worth your time,I bought this because I thought it would be interesting to study the mind of Brady through his writing. This was a disappointment. The first part is just him raving about how cruel people are towards criminals and then he just talks about other serial killers and how he is smarter than both them and the police. I could only get about 3.5/4 of the way through before I had to put it down. I can sum it up for you by telling you he's a narcissistic socio/psychopath (not sure which).
3,MORE OF THE SAME,"I have purchased all the Laura Fygi CD's I could find...this one I paid $25.00 for on Amazon. I thought it would be ""better"" than the others CD""s due to the price. It wasn't. It's more of the same & I was disappointed. Ms Fygi has a beautiful voice & a ""gift"" in language, however, he style never changes. I have purchased my last of her CD's.If you have never heard her nor of her....chose a CD, it's worth it. I think I just own too many. Her Spanish is beautifully sang...as is her French & Portuguese. I can't tell you how good her Chinese is but it sounds good. Versatile lady, sweet sexy listening....good ""mood"" music.Worth a purchase or two.Suzanne"
4,Slaughter Dagger,"The Slaughter Dagger is a solid build but weak. The Body is a simple make, (in some cases even simpler than the Shenlong Gundam 1/144). The shield actually looks better if put behind the hand and not on the side. The backpack item is very dull but has move-able boosters and carries two extra beam saber handles (short hilts). There isnt much paint needed to look like the picture, just the shield. NOTE: The gun comes in a black color, not the advertised blue. The model itself is well built, but the sabers beams are a like fragile and break easily into the holding part of the hilt.Pros:Starting an army? Basic grunt figureShield is cool and sturdy attachmentFour hiltsSolid buildCool colorsNearly no stickersCons:Overall not too remarkableFragile beams (yellow btw)back back is a hindrance"
2,Bossa Nova is Brazilian not Cuban Music,"Bossa Nova is not to be played as if it were a moving salsa. No 'maraccas' or 'bongos', please.As played by Schifrin in this album, Bossa Nova does not hip."
2,not very good,"What can I say? This book is only okay. It's the kind of book you pick up and then don't think twice about putting down again. Wish I would have spent my hard-earned cash on a better one. Oh well. Better luck next time, I guess."
3,Tying Up Loose Ends,"For fans of the 'Movie Without The Movie' Event: Shadows of the Empire, this is a great little epilogue. Author Steve Perry takes the opportunity to explore life for Guri without Xizor and the future of Black Sun in this collected series.The Empire is directionless, yet still dangerous, as the post-Jedi years continue on. Looking for allies, Luke, Leia, and Han get caught up in this tale that is artistically lighter than its predecessor. And also, learn Dash Rendar's true fate!Recommended for die hard Star Wars nuts, and a nice read for an occasional fan."
2,disappointing,"A past reader of J. Benson's A-Z guide, I was heartily disappointed by this year's edition. The combination with the rotissere guide does neither a service. The old guide, with more stats and capsule summaries, was by far better than this year's effort."
4,A Perfect book for beginers in this huge sea called Ferrari,"Excellent book with the essencial info needed to understand the philosophy of the most famous car maker in the world. Customers looking for advanced technical information may feel disappointed, but the marvelous glossy pictures worth every buck spent."
5,I love true stories,"This was a gift for my brother who had been on a safari. He let me read it too. It is a true story, well written and a good read."
3,Dr. Berendzen does it again!!,"In a really good book, reminiscent of his other works, especially ""Come here:a man overcomes sexual abuse"", Dr. B takes us into the life of a university president. (And I always thought they enjoyed all those fancy dinners!!)Read it for fun, ..."
1,rotten,I got one book not a ten volume set and berton braley was not even in it.False advertising. really discusted with this purchase.
4,Okay... Not best for Spark Plugs,This is a nice hard steel. The socket needs a magnet if you want to use it for spark plugs. Other than that its worth the money.
4,Good kung fu movie selections,"The films in this set are good to have Chen Shen is great in Shaolin monk, Shaolin hero has an allstar cast some good spear work by Leiang Kar Laing also stars Meng Fei and Phillip Ko. The weakest film is Shaolin Monk fights back which gets boring at times but the final fight scene is good."
2,Commercial Electroplating,"The book has some good ideas in it. The only problem is that it looks like it is copied on a photocopier and stapled together! Some of the pages are even cut off on the edge of the type. The information is a little hard to find in the book, but otherwise it is a good book."
2,Plater's Review,"Very short book. It needs to be more comprehensive. Being a professional plater, I had no problems following the book but I would not recommend it for novices. Too hard to follow for those not already in the business."
4,Amazing cutting board,"After using this cutting board for a while, I realized how puny looking my old cutting board was. This thing is huge. I can dice 4 large onions and still have room for cutting other vegetables.It is extremely dense and sturdy feeling, despite being 1/2"" thin. The description says it's 2.5 lbs. -- it's not. It has got to be about 5 lbs or so.The only downside is that while it is dishwashable, it doesn't fit!! It's too large to fit in my dishwasher. I would have to remove the top drawer, and then put it in sideways to fit."
1,Great If You Don't Mind Cutting Board Particles In Your Food,"I brought a black Epicurean cutting board and loved it so much that I went back and brought 2 more. Then one day, while cutting meat,I noticed black particles on my knife. When I checked my meat, it had black particles too. It turns out that it came from the cutting board! After consistent repeat incidents of this, I had to throw all 3 boards away because I wasn't sure what was getting into my food when I cut. Very expensive lesson - since these aren't exactly cheap."
3,folding shelf bracket sp1794,"I was disappointed in the strength of the brackets...I thought they would be ideal for my fold out work bench,but unfortunately they were flimsier than I expected. I did however make them work,..but I would have liked to seen more rigidity,they bent very easily."
3,A Pity Really,"I had such high hopes for this book. However it fell short of the mark. This writing style is a little lackluster and the character sketches were weak. Each major character did and said things but their individual personalities were not well developped. Each character had a similar way of speaking, as though they all had one voice.The writing style is younger, grades 5-9, than a few of the plot developments. I thought the incidence of promiscuity on pages 68-70 should have been reserved for a book written for grades 9-12. I would have it alluded to much more subtly for the age and writing style of the present book.The historical research was terrific, well developped, and fully displayed.This time period deserves to have an engrossing historical fiction read for middle and high school. I wish this had been that book."
1,Misrepresentation of product,"I purchased the Kettler Edition Power Stepper but was supplied the Kettler Montana Stepper instead. I refused the product and after speaking with ATAFA (Amazon Sporting Goods Affiliate), was told that the Kettler Edition Power Stepper was not offered anymore and the only stepper available was the Montana Stepper. Additionally, I was informed that I would be charged with a 20% restocking fee if I wanted to return the product making it costly for me due to Amazon's and/or ATAFA mistake. Therefore, I now have the Kettler Montana Stepper purchased at an elevated cost associated with the Kettler Edition Power Stepper.Amazon and their affiliate, ATAFA do not represent good business practices and I will never do business with either again or recommend Amazon to any of my friends.PeterKettler Edition Power Stepper"
1,a not-so-true account of a sad life,"Knowing some of the parties mentioned in this book, I have to say that Tammy wrote this book for sympathy on her part. While she was one of the greatest female voices in country music, she also did not accept her share of the blame for her bad marriages. I have sympathy for much of what she went through, but parts of this book were greatly exaggerated, to portray her as a ""victim"". She may have been a ""victim"" at times, but it took two to tango."
4,As advertised!,The book came pretty much as advertised. We are very pleased with the condition. Thanks!
5,Pure entertainment in applied analysis,"The book is like a David Attenborough animal show: at every turn there is a new marvelous ""animal"" that pops its head out. What makes this possible is the subject: building approximations using asymptotic methods. Each remarkable approximation comes after the author has showed us how to almost painlessly ferret it out. This is why the book works so well, chapter after chapter we learn beautiful tricks through a clear and concise presentation."
2,Not good for the price,I purchased the math one and was very happy with it. This one is not that great for the price. You could buy other abc products for much less and better quality.Sent it back after this was opened.The math / pattern one is great...
2,For this much money it should have had an editor,"Honestly, the sentence structure in this book is so dismal that it is challenging to read. I'm not sure if I'll read anymore out of my own copy - and I just read two pages after opening to the chapter on cointegration."
4,"Very catchy material, with solid playing","This is some really good, original material. I was surprised at how well the songs were crafted. Better than most of the new bands out there."
4,nothing to fear here,"I was recently at Kenny's Castaway's, in greenich village, when these guys were playing. They were definitely the the best band playing that night, and I meant to get a cd from them. but I forgot. luckily, I remember they said it was available at amazon. so here I am! if you like gin blossoms, goo goo dolls and foo fighters, you will definitely dig this band. I thought they were signed, but they're not. it's refreshing to hear radio friendly tunes instead of another rap & roll band. this cd is very good. check it out and add it to your collection."
2,Chuck is basically defective,"I bought one of these over a year ago. The chuck recently failed. It will no longer lock, no matter how much I fiddle with it. I thought, at this price range, I'd finally be buying a drill that would last.The chuck is pretty bad, even when it works. Good luck getting it more than a little tight.Other than the chuck, it is a pretty solid drill."
4,best drill ever,"This is the strongest cordless I have used. I work construction. This drill is powerful, dependable, and takes a lot of abuse on a job. I now have two of this model. Only thing I can say bad is it is a little heaver than most, but worth the weight."
5,Great for those susceptible to headaches,"I have a hard time finding headbands because the tight ones give me terrible headaches and the loose ones won't hold my hair back. This is the perfect medium. I holds my hair even after 45 minutes of running and isn't so tight that I get headaches.I don't care about color - although they were dead on. There's not much difference to be found in black, grey, tan and brown."
4,Good for Bikram/Hot Yoga; Keeps fly aways at bay,"As earlier described, colors are much different than picture, but these 4 headbands are functional for any hot activity (Bikram, running, etc.). Stay put design doesn't roll off the back of your head (even with short hair), and it keeps the sweat out of eyes. Withstands the washing machine well (I hang dry). Certainly a great product."
3,Nice yoga headbands,"I only gave three stars because these headbands are a little lose. I have a pretty large head and when I wear these to hot yoga classes, the weight of my hair pulls on these, causing them to slip out of place. I have short, chin-length hair and I was disappointed they didn't stay in place better. Also there is not much elasticity to them, so if you like the feel of a tight and snug headband, try something else. I still use these to pull my hair back when I'm washing my face."
2,Disappointing,"Given the promising title, I expected the book to be just a bit longer . . . . sadly, it fails to contain the entire Internet or even a small fraction thereof."
2,Looks nice but...,It looks great! But it made me break out in hives on my finger. I have never broken out in hives if its sterling silver...i was shocked! Beware!
3,NIKKI FRITZ RULES,"Although it's true that this is a compilation DVD, the sequence with Nikki Fritz alone is worth the price of this, or at least a ren tal."
1,Futuro size L,I got mine got more then double the price from CVS. had pain and had to have it. didn't work for me. slides and folds and more annoying then helping. waste of money.
5,"great product, good seller",This is a great compilation. If you don't feel like going back and buying all the old CD's this will definitely hit the high points and maybe make you want a bit more.
4,Join this Cult.,"The Cult always seem like they're one of those bands that everyone wish they got into sooner because they were so good. To me they represent everything cool about rock n' roll. Good style, smart lyrics, a bit mystical, and above all else, rockin' songs. Something good to crank when you're cruisin' down western highways in your convertible. This is about as good as one disc could be, and I'm really happy it contains ""The Witch"" from the ""Cool World"" soundtrack. Don't know any Cult songs? Imagine The Doors mixed with Danzig and a dash of Cinderella. Well...something like that."
4,Pure Rock,"The Cult are an overlooked rock band that produced some great music from the mid 80's to early 90's. They only had one top ten album, Sonic Temple, and no hit singles in the States. Their music always reminds of the Doors with a harder edge. ""She Sells Sanctuary"" is a truly great song and makes this disk worth buying by itself. Other stand out tracks include ""Fire Woman"", ""Love Removal Machine"", ""Rain"" & ""Edie (Ciao Baby)"". There are few cuts from their later 90's albums that could have been cut out, but one can't really complain when you get 19 songs on album."
4,"Always good, occassionally great, and lots of it.","This disk raises some questions, such as why wasn't this band more popular in its heyday? Not consumately a ""Hair Band"" or really any of those odd '80's Rock sub-genres, they were just a really great band. If you liked ""Love Removal Machine"" or ""She Sells Sanctuary"", it's all pretty much like that. 19 songs from 6 great albums, it's a really good time. Bravo!"
2,The Cult is overrated,"Many people refer to the Cult as ""underrated"". But anytime someone mentions The Cult, they describe them as an awesome, often overlooked band from the 80's. Therefore, I'm going to refer to them as ""overrated"". This album, even though it contains the band's supposed best work, doesn't do much for me. The one song on the album that is definitely a classic is ""She Sells Sanctuary"". That song is the only reason I gave this album a second star. All of the other material is standard hard-rock fare. I've heard many other bands that sound just like, or better, than The Cult. Many people would argue that's because The Cult were ""trend-setting visionaries"". I disagree; there were many bands slamming out hard rocking music with a country-esque flair long before ""Fire Woman"" hit the airwaves. If you want a flavorless taste of hard rock, go with The Cult."
3,another action film,"nothing new here,but never gets shown on tv,so makes a change,lots of action,and not bad story,moves fast as well,only old vhs copies left,so buy soon if you wish to view."
2,Great movie...bad version,"This is wonderful movie with a great score. Highly recommended. However, this particular copy seems like a bootleg. If you look closely at the cover, you can see that it says ""Witt & Funny"" and there are lots more typos in the small print below the title.When you try to play it, the default menu is in Asian characters. Also, it is called ""Special Edition"" but there are no special features.Disappointing!"
5,It's Finally Released on CD!,"Lobo Delivers with this blast from the past collection. This double album CD of his earlier works, shows the many talents of Lobo. From his first album which features ""Me and You and A Dog Named Boo"" to his best selling album titled ""Of A Simple Man"" which yielded his biggest hit song to date ""I'd Love You To Want Me"". with other top 40 hits including ""Don't Expect Me To Be Your Friend"" and ""A Simple Man"", Many titles in this package such as ""A Big Red Kite"" ""There Ain't No Way"" and Running Deer"" could have been hits. This CD is just the ticket for a long and stressful day. All Lobo's albums are worth the investment. Wounded Bird Records did an excellent job of reproducing these albums. Thank you!"
5,LOBO,"Great service and arrived promptly. Me, You, and a Dog named Boo was my wife and my first song. We loved it and it came out when we first started dating in 1971. I bought her a stuffed dog and she named it ""Boo."" Here we are 40 years later celebrating our 40th anniversary on Dec. 4th. My old vinyl album ""Introducing Lobo"" is a bit scratched up and ""Boo"" is history; so I was glad to find this one. Plus I got a bonus album along with the original. Brings back a lot of memories, all good."
4,A Good Read.,"I liked this novel. It's actually better then the main X-Men novels, with the story centering on the characters and not on long, drawn out plots that go no where. (Which is what we see in many X-Men stories today). Elliot S. Maggin is a good writer here, developing Lobdell's plot for Generation X into a smooth story from start to finish, A surprise villian turns up in this novel, which adds to the suspence right up to the final chapter."
2,a surprising letdown,"I am a huge fan of the X-title comic books (or at least when I can afford to buy them) and I usually find them wonderful to read. I am also a fan of the comic books that have been written as novels (I've read the death of superman, a couple of spiderman books, and golden's first book in his x-man trilogy) and I've found most of them to be excellent. Especially the X-titles. But this book just didn't have it. The characters were never developed (they spent most of the time moping around), the plot was weak. The drawings were good though. There just didn't seem to be a purpose to this story. I know the authors can do better work, and I hope to see them do better in the future. This book makes me want to only read a comic-book-turned-novel if it has Chistopher Golden's name afterwards. But, if they write another X-book, I'll give them another try. I see room for potential."
1,Tote bag tears after 2 weeks,The tote bag only last two weeks of limited use before the thread that holds it together starts to shred on the upper bag. Save your money and freeze your water overnight and add water when you are ready to drink it will be cool.
1,Doesn't last,"This water bottle is great until the seams fall apart, which happens quickly. Too bad - since totes like this are hard to find."
4,In Search of a Commendable Legacy,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two sections on family and sports. Although the third section, which contains a lot of technical information, had the potential to be difficult to understand it is a fairly easy read."
1,I'll admit I misread the label,"I originally thought this was gop hand cleaner. However goop or gop, fact of the matter is it didn't get the job done."
3,Not for everyone,"The author has a tendency to speak down to his readers and get very deep into some subjects. Beginners may be a little intimidated. Some of the subject matter is a little repetitious as well. Please note this is a study on wisdom in Proverbs, not just Proverbs, which means a few verses from different chapters are studied, not a chapter by chapter study.That being said, I believe if God is present, any study can be beneficial, this one included. Our small group has mixed experience levels and we are all growing, learning and being challenged with this study."
2,How could Carlos put his name on this?,"I had higher expectations from a brand like Latin Percussion. The ""musical instruments"" in this kit are barely better than toy quality. The maracas are plastic. Everything is made in Thailand. The most important instrument, the one that holds the whole band together -- the cowbell, sounds dead. I hate to say it but...Less Cowbell!!"
2,Good Game,"This game is fun...but takes ALOT of time to beat a level! In alot of the levels you have to play for AT LEAST 3 hours to beat it, even if ur fulfilling all the requirements of the level!"
1,NOT WORTH IT,"Great game but it gets so Frusterating when all your guest get so mad. I have this game, and at first i liked it but it is a mission impossible to win or inprove your park. If you ever make a cool ride all your guest's hate it and start to get mad and then leave."
1,"Would love to play the game, but I can't see the graphics","I'm fairly adept with computers and have a brand new system and the latest OS and driver sets. I have tried repeatedly to play this game. What I get is a blurred (ghosted) monitor screen. My display adaptor exceeds requirements, I have sent e-mail messages to Hasbro for technical help, but have not gotten any response."
1,this game took away my innocence,"ok, i had have played bad games before but this game took the CAKE! This game was the reason my dad told me how cruel the world can be and how people make junk just to take your money. ok so long ago, when i was 7 my dad bought me this, i wanted it to ride coasters and cool stuff, but when i started the game there werent any roller coasters! JUST GRASS EVERYWHERE! i tired for weeks y there werent any roller coasters but could not figure it out, it was AWFUL. so i told my dad and he and me tried very hard to figure out where the roller coasters were at 4 HOURS. MANY, MANY, MANY, HOURS! we never figured it out and my dad was upset and told me y he had to return it. with my innocence taken from me i instead played doom 2, WHICH IS SO MUCH BETTER!!"
5,Don't Buy it if You Want a Life!,"We bought this game for my nine year old son who loves roller coasters. He absolutely loves it. We hav a race to the computer every morning to see who gets to play it first. It is completely absorbing, so don't start playing it if you want to get anything else done that day! My son is really good at designing the rollercoasters himself (his mother unfortunately is not!). We also bought the expansion pack to go with it, which gives you some fun options. I highly recommend this game (just be careful, or you may forget to eat!)"
5,a great game by william wise,the game is fun all the roller coaster and stuff build your on roller coaster it took me about 3 months to beat the game its a cheat u can do by does value parks all u have to do is close your park people that want get out of your park you have to throw them in the water then your park value will go up when you get to mega park your achievement is to have fun so im at the park Evergreens Garden i been playing with that park for ten years you need to go get the game the game is fun
3,"Awesome, Fun, Dull, Boring.","When i first bought this game roughly a year ago i thought it would be something that would last for a long time. Dont get me wrong or anything, the game was great, but after a while the fun dimmed down. After playing the scenario over and over again got boring. Also, the game gives you goals for your park and a timelimit to achieving that goal, in my mind i believe the game should have let you win if you achieved the goal before the time limit, instead of waiting for hours to complete. The gameplay is good and balanced and graphics aren't bad from a birds eye view point. Replay on the other hand is a set back. After coming back to play this game day after day, its seemed old and boring. Sounds are also bad and annoying (except the people screaming on your roller coaster.) All in all i expected more, but i was glad i bought it and it is still on my hard drive today."
5,"Innovative, creative, and spectacular","An idea developed from Chris Sawyer's ""Transport Tycoon"", this game takes amusement park building to a whole new level from previous games like ""Theme Park."" The animation is nothing special, but if it was more detailed, the game would take a hit because it is necessary to have kind of an aerial view of parts of your park. That way, you can find out where there is vandalism, vomit, or lost guests. Also, it will be easier to you to build rides such as ROLLER COASTERS. You can either build premade roller coasters or build your own. It is difficult to get the hang of building your own roller coasters, though. There is a fair amount of gameplay variety, and you can build parks in a forest, in a desert, in a mine, even in a lake. Highly recommended. If you buy this, get the expansion pack ""Loopy Landscapes"" at the same time, or if you are not sure, get this first."
5,"Easy To Learn, Great To Play","A great game. Do Not Waste your money on Sim Theme Park,or Sim Coaster, this is so much easier to play,and has a lot more features. I loved this game so much, I went out and bought Sim Coaster, but I couldn't even learn how to play it. I highly recommend this game!!!!!"
4,One Of The Best Games Ever.,This is one of the best games I have ever played second only to worms and starwars droid works.
5,Addictive Personalties BEWARE,"This is a brilliant fusion sophisticated simming, and simple engineering. The ability to build roller coasters is easy to learn, and the levels increase in challenge as the players skill grows. Held together by an arcade style level structure, where after completing one challenge the player enters his or her name complete with score, this game can consume more hours then most of the world. Put both arms up, and get ready to scream, this is the best sim game . . . EVER."
5,awesome game,"This game is great, wonderful play it all the time. Lost my old one...had withdrawl needed a new one to play corkscrew fallies and roller coaster 2"
5,Blows Sim Theme Park away!,"This game is great, and extremely addictive! I bought it a few years ago when it first came out, and I have bought both expansion packs. But now I am devestated because I got a new computer that didn't it have it installed, and now I lost the original CD, so I can't install any of them. But if I don't find it, I am going to definitley buy a new one!"
4,Hours of fun,A great christmas gift for my 10 year old nephew. It is the best thing I could have bought for him. It allows him to play and explore and learn at the same time. I wish they had this stuff when I was a kid.
5,THIS GAME ROCKS!!!,"THIS GAME IS SO FUN. AS SOON AS I GOT IT I WAS HOOKED ON IT. YOU CAN BUILD ROLLAR COASTERS, MAKE FOOD STANDS, GIFT SHOPS AND PLACE REST STOPS TO MAKE YOUR COSTOMERS HAPPY. IT IS REALLY FUN AND I SUGGGEST IT FOR KIDS 7 AND UP. THE BEST PART IT THAT IT HAS NO VILENCE OR FOUL LAUNGUAGE, SO IT IS SUITABLE FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN"
5,"Yes, this game is ADDICTING :^)","Great game for kids to adults. Too bad it doesn't have network play which would make it; 6 ****** stars? Save your games so you can go back and practice making great roller coasters at Forest Frontiers. The shorter the ride time, the more money you'll make. Have FUN & ENJOY the game ;)"
5,Lots of fun for all ages!,"I love this game. I bought it for my sister and I ended up playing it more then she does. My aunt has the same problem. I think one of the best aspects of the game is how the situations gradually get more difficult, adding a real challange to the game."
4,Great fun but addictiveness wears off quickly,"This is a terrific, nonviolent, constructive (so to speak) game. It's great fun, and when I got it on a Thursday, I played it for a few hours that night, then a few more hours Friday night, and then all day Saturday and Sunday.Since then, I still play it, but not with the same feverishness as before. It's still fun, but the beginning scenarios have started to look the same. Pump up the research, but food courts, make the park smaller by breaking up paths, etc. I expect that some of the later scenarios will get more difficult, but right now, the game isn't too hard.It's pretty and neat to look at it, but be warned that it may not be as addictive as made out to be by other reviews."
3,"Good, but...","This game is pretty cool but not nearly as addicting or as well done as the Sim line of games. The inability to perform certain function (speed up time, search for rides in your park by name, etc) makes managing frustrating. If you've played The Sims or SimCity, this is probably a step down."
3,"Excellent game, *but*...","It does not work well on Windows NT. It crashes now and again, and the houses won't get roofs, for example. (I know they say it is for Windows 95 and 98, but still, I'm just warning you.)"
3,Ok,YOu can waste your money on this game or spen a few extra dollars on the second one. The second one has more rides and is easier to control.
3,"Fun, but gets boring after a while","When you first purchase it, this game is really fun. My friend had it and I loved it so much, I bought it with my own money. I shouldn't have, becuase there was another game I wanted, and now I'm sick of this one. Being twelve years old, my attention span is very short. This game would be more fun if you didn't have to beat the first (most boring) levels to move on to more exciting levels. Another thing that bugs me is that- It seems so long to get through one year. It takes forever to accomplish your ""Object of the Game"" thingy. Though this game is really fun the first few times you play it, It gets really boring just staring at the little men with brown hair and clothes in really messed up color combonations. Overall, this game could use a little more fun. I think that one thing would make this game better. The ability to ride your rollercoasters and go to other attractions. But, for now, this game is just boring."
3,Good Game but......,I am what you would call call a tycoon junkie but not much into the scenerio games that come with the tycoon games.If they only had more freeform games this game would have gotten a 5 star.I suggest you wait until November when they release RCT 2.
5,I love this game!,It's old school but SO much fun. I accidently uninstalled it from my computer and had to buy a new copy. Totally worth it.
4,Possibly the theme park sim game so far...,"With tons of replay factor, this game is a must buy. It requires the right amount of skill and gives 50+ hours of fun. A wide variety of pieces to use makes your theme park the best. The idea is to gain money. You need good rides to do that. But it isn't all about crazy rollarcoasters that make dudes hurl. It is an attraction for the whole familly which makes sissy rides for infants nesscasary. Plus you will need stores, snack boothes, restrooms, and more to stay in business. This game is fun for the whole familly. The only major con is that the game is a bit slow. But it is still a great game. I recommend this game to all gamers who like to look at picture perfect graphics and are willing to put a lot of time into a game. 4 out of 5. Laterz!"
5,This game is addicting...beware,"My boyfriend got this game a few weeks before Christmas, and when we are not together, working or going to school, we usually can be found playing it. It is very addicting. There really isn't anything that I would change.Now that I am back at school, I have my own verison and my there is also one at my parents' house. I recommend this game for anyone that has ever complained about a a theme park, this is for you. You can personally see how hard it is to design and opperate a park. This is one of the best games I have ever played."
4,Fun Day,This is a fun game. If you have a good scenario and start well you can have a real good time.
3,An O.K Game,"When I first got roller coaster tycoon I played it for 5 hours. The I played it for the whole summer!but then it started getting boring. Vandalism everywhere,Everyone is throwing up everywhere and you can't build your own rides because it gets too hard. I won't say this game is bad and I won't say this game is great. I have to say it is worth the money."
2,ok,"well it is not that good as the others. I suggest getting this than any of the sim theme parks.... U probably want to get corckscrew follies or loopy landscapes because for one thing u can't keep your customers from exiting the park whereas in the others u can.. Just place a sign in front of the exit and place no entry and they can't leave!! There aren't very many good stalls or rides or anything compared to the other games. I suggest loopy lanscapes. Because it has all three of the games in it. it has corkscrew follies this one and even three (real parks) where u can get like 105 thousand dollars!!! and there are things like coffe, t-shirt, and hat stalls!!!"
4,Really addictive!,"I downloaded the demo for this game, loved it, and bought the real thing the next day. Now, months later, I still play this game every day when I get a spare second! I love all the different roller coasters and how you get to design your own rides. I rated it 4 stars only because I really hate how you can't minimize the screen. I also dislike the fact that people barf on the pathways, despite the many trash cans and bathrooms they could do it in instead. However, altogether it's a brilliant game and appropriate for anyone old enough to control the mouse! I highly recommend it to everyone."
5,Rollercoaster Tycoon is Addicting.......................,I have had Rollercoaster Tycoon for at least 3 years....and I have all of the expansions and wish that there was another expansion to it. I am working on my 52nd theme park.....and still have loads of fun left to it. It is addicting....like when I am waiting on more money to work with I go and do like my house work........and keep checking on the computer to see if I have money to build things with. I love the game and it is one of my favorite games. I am always telling people about it and to download the demo. I started playing by downloading the demo but soon got mad cause when I would get start.....I mean really get started on building my theme park the demo would automatic shut off on me and I would get mad so I went out and got me the game and started playing it.Does anyone out there know if there will be another expansion coming to us? And if so when?
5,The Best of the Best,It doesn't matter whether you hate sim games (I do!) This game is by far the most fun game I have played! It has an easy to use control set-up (point and click) but is deep enough to keep you playing forever! I recommend this one to anyone with a computer... The rides are awesome and can be built in any way you can imagine and the parks are so cool. Don't dare pass this one up.
4,rollercoastertycoon,i bought this game on a whim and i didn't think that i would like it--but guess what---i can't stop playing it! i don't like games but this one is the easiest and most addictive game around! I would recommend it to all that love the thrill of riding and capitalizm at it's finest! Spend the $$$ and get this game--you will not be disappointed and maybe you'll want to open your own park!
5,Great Family Game -You'll get caught up!,My ten year old son received this game as a gift and loves it! With very little outside instruction from(parents)he was on his way to building fun and challenging amusement parks.It teaches many things including making & losing money.It also encourages taking care of what you own and that you can build something that works well if you try. I pass by and end up standing behind him for 1/2 an hour. I can't wait to try myself. This is a great game if you want to avoid the dark magic or violent action ones that parents try to avoid.
5,Great Fun,This is a great game! The custom coasters are the thing that really gives this game its value. There are so many different options you can add to your park. Hours and hours of fun A must buy!
2,"Fun,but gives one the feeling of being under preasure","this game is fun, no question about that. But on all scenarios that you play there are goals like must have 1,400 guests at the end of year three and stuff like that which makes one feel ""oh no, i only have a month left to attract a 1000 more guests! i can never do that. I might as well just give up"" I think that kind of defeats the whole purpose of HAVING FUN. But, the alternative is to ignore the objectives and deal with failing the goal. Of courese, if you do that, you'll be playing the same 3 levels over and over again! But overall, it a cool game."
5,awesome sauce,"When i received the game, I was so happy. Loved this game, lost my copy and easily got a new one. Works well with windows 7, just some pausing issues. other than that, it is amazing!!"
5,"Gives New Meaning to ""Cyber-Space""!","In this awesome computer sim, you can control a roller coaster dynasty. As owner and designer of all the rides and attractions, you call the shots for every detail of this game. One of the best features is the ability to create the most death defying, gut wrenching roller coasters ever. From winning awards of ""The Tidyest Park in the Country"" to ""The Best Roller Coasters"", this game takes the cake! A feature I like is the power and speed ability to launch rides ""To Infinity and Beyond!"" So therefore, you can build a roller coaster with only 2 track pieces and put it on power launch mode, and watch customers fly into Cyber-Space! So, if you want a great game to satisfy the addictive conrol freak within, Roller Coaster Tycoon is for you!"
5,Addicting,"A must have. This game is down right addicting. You cannot stop playing. On this game, you can name the people who enter your park, but not the workers. On future RCT games, you could name the workers who work in the park. It's a fun game, and sometimes challenging. I recommend this to people who love strategy games."
5,Amazing Detail,The most amaizing this about this totally addictive game is its unbelievable attention to detail. You don't need to be a rollercoaster enthusiast to enjoy this game!
4,Pretty Neat !!!,"This is a pretty cool game. The graphics are great and I think the programmers programmed it superior. You can build snack shops,water,rollercoaters,paths, and can raise or lower the land. Snow Resort tycoon probably is better but that's okay. Although it's addicting and time-consuming,this is still wonderful. Of all the other tycoon games this is the most popular. If one has time, they should buy it."
4,A good game,"Roller coaster tycoon is a fun game. If you want a good simulation game, get roller coaster tycoon. It is better than any Sim City game I have played, and easier to beat. Different levels adds a twist to this game. Unless you get stuck on a level, you won't find yourself board."
4,Such a good game for such a good price,"It is usually hard to find good games for cheap prices. This is such a good game because you can build unbelieveable Roller coasters, see what your customers are thinking, and make a very sucessful theme park. I recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy. The only thing is that the graphics aren't really great. There pretty good but they could have been better. Have Fun!"
5,Totally Addicting!,"I guess that's a good thing, when you are up all night playing a game, some might consider it less than ideal when you have to go to work the next day.I did run into a couple problems with it not reacting well to some other Windows programs I was running, but it never crashed, just reversed colors or other weird things until I shut the other programs off. No big deal.The game itself is very well done, tons of fun. I don't know what I enjoy more, building the park ago, but have found most sims since then rather boring. This one is NOT! Definitely a winner."
4,THIS GAME IS A GOOD SIM,"At first, you fall in love with the game!! It can not be put down. The graphics are incredible. There are also many different rides to choose to build. You can build and manage your very own theme park!! It is a must have for any sim lover or any theme park enthusiastic."
1,Roller Coaster Tycoon Good...... NO WAY!!!!!,"I all-ready have this game. First when I got the game it was fun. But then I got tired of it. I say ""Don't get the game."" Let's review shall we. First good. Next bad!!!!!!!"
5,Audio,"The game is wonderful, my grandchildren love it, but when they installed it in my computer,a Compaq 2100 series, it knocked out my audio. I no longer have sound. Has anyone else had this problem? I have worked with technicians over the phone, and so far, no luck with the sound."
1,Roller Coaster Tycoon,"i recently just bought the game online but, the game will not install or start up. i use windows, is there something im doing wrong ?"
3,Roller coaster tycoon,the game had it's good points...unfortunatly it was contradicted by the downs. even though it in its self is fun the concept and places are too hard...mainly because of the darn trees that can't be built over but rather deleted which costs money.in term it ... totaly!!
3,"Good at the beginning, like most",Rollor coaster Tycoon is like most computer games because it fun at the beging like most computer games. At the beging it's a trill. All you want to do is make your park succesful. But after you master the game that's it. The trill last about 3 weeks.
3,An OK game,"This game fun sometimes,but is can also be really anoying. I hate the roller coaster design thing because it is hard to use. I hate when I have built the world best roller coaster only to find I can't connect the last piece of track. Overall this is an OK game."
2,fun...for a few weeks,"This game is so addcitive, or should i say WAS ADDICTIVE. It keeps you glued to your computer for about 3 weeks and then after that, you wanna glue it to your shelf and never touch it again. This has little replay value."
3,(Insert Annoying Shrieking Rollercoaster Sound Here),"Roller Coaster Tycoon is sort of reminiscent of the Sims. Why? because after a month of playing, it gets about as boring as possible. I beat about five of the levels but it took forever. Why? Because the game makes you wait for a real long time to reach the objective. By the third month I have already reached the objective and need to go do other things for three hours while the days pass onscreen. and then, a the end of the second year my computer goes to sleep and I can't get it back up again. Great. Now what? A wasted five hours? I bought the second expansion big deal, a few more Rollercoasters and themes and new levels. But I can't understand how anyone can beat this game. It's impossible unless you suddenly live in a Starbucks and have a month off to do whatever you want. My advice? Don't buy unless tyou've got some time to urn on something that's not even worth the time spending looking for it Online, much less the money you're paying on it."
5,the best theme park game on the market,"I played games like theme park and sim city all the time when i was young. Then one day roller coaster tycoon hit me in the face like a rock. It is theme park but 120% better. you build rollercoasters and stalls. You manage you finace, staff and ride reserch. When you first start the game you can choose out of 5 senarios and every time that you compleate one another one becomes available. They get harder as the game continues. It would take a long time to compleate all the senarios and i have never done it myself but if you want to find out what they all are you can download a trainer of the internet and enable them all. You enter the game and build build build untill you compleate the objective given. Exciting, challenging, intellectual and requires imagination."
5,The Best Computer Game Ever,"RollerCoaster Tycoon is the best computer game ever, in my opinion. Unlike SimCity, there is action, and you get to see what you build in use. You can custom design more than just roads, too. There is a ton of excitement and most of the time when I'm playing I'm only a couple inches from the computer screen. It's always fun to get new scenarios and rides, and you can do that .... This is the best game I have ever played."
5,An epic game of the 90's that never gets old,"I used to play this a lot as a kid on my Windows '98 computer (haha, so old). I forgot about it until recently, when my boyfriend was playing it on his laptop, so I decided I wanted to purchase the game and play it again. Low and behold, it is still as fun as it was ten-odd years ago. It is one of those games that never gets old, along with The Sims and Mario Kart on Nintendo '64. :)"
5,It's the best Tycoon game EVER!!!!!!,"This game is a great game and is my favorite. My favorite part of the game is creating your own Roller Coaster. You can advertise your park and your rides, give half price and free coupons to keep your tourists coming back for more. The only flaw is that they stop giving you rides after a few years. The expansion games are even better!!!!"
5,Really fun game,"I couldnt afford it, but my friend had it. I went to his house almost every day. Great grapics, but the ppl are all men. The rollercoasters are good, but some of them stink. This rollercoaster I built it launched, and just exploded with no reason. This little glich on the screen made my waterslide go up in flames. It is still good tho."
4,RCT Is Great!,"I like computer games. Roller Coaster Tycoon is my second favorite game, only Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is better. I like how real the game is, for example, weeds grow in the grass and people get hungry. It is very realistic, but there are some problems. One problem is that the guests are so stupid.They think that the exit for a ride is the park exit and get lost! Here are some ways to possibly solve that problem. Don't build long winding paths or dead ends. I don't have an expansion pack, but they might open the game"
4,one of the best computer games ever,"this is the best game ever for your computer at home.youre first place is forest frontiers which is pretty easy,then it gets a little harder. if u have too many people at youre park,people will complain and there will be all throw ups everwhere.try to keep youre people capacity to its normal rate. also when u have enough money get the roller coaster called mischief and if u can build a long que line youll have lots of money to make!!"
3,Average,This game is average. It is a pretty fun sim. I played it for about a month straight. You get to make your dream theme park. One problem i didnt really like is there isnt enough room in the parks. It gets pretty boring when there isnt enough room to build a really cool roller coaster you want to build. But all and all this game is fun.
4,Roller Coaster Fun!!!!!!,"This is THE best game for computers in the entire world. I spend hours a day playing this and trying to build the ultimate amusement park. Once you get the add-ons - Corkscrew Follies and Loopy Landscapes, the fun really begins. So, Go. Buy. Now."
5,Good battery,This battery is just right for my Olympus 35mm film camera. It lasts a long time since it's Lithium. Long shelf life
4,Battery life,"This panasonic has already lasted longer than the last ""generic"" brand battery I got locally. I am satisfied so far."
1,Dress,"I work at Target and every day I'm there people are talking about Bratz dolls. I honestly don't understand why everyone is crazed over them, but I do think that they are cool and what have you. I, as a teenager think the close look cool except for this &quot;Girl's Night Out Collection&quot;. Honestly, when I am eventually a mother I am not going to want my daughter having a doll thats dress like this. Seriously, do you honestly think this is a good influence for your 6 year-old daughter? Just think about it."
3,This book is a winner!,I just got through reading and looking at the beautiful photography of an area that I am very familiar with. Yet I found that I learned a great deal about facets of the Bay that I din't know existed. It is going to make some wonderful gifts for my family and friends. The views are spectular and Anderson has been able to catch the light and color so effectively.
5,Great Diaper,I love the way this diaper fits. We switched from Pampers Cruisers because our daughter seemed to be in between two sizes. Huggies Supreme fits perfect.
1,Horrible diapers.,"Like others, i REALLY wanted to like these. we have been Pampers Cruisers fans for a long time, and then the Dry Max problems came along, so we wanted to try something new, and we bought these.At first i thought they were okay. i was miffed after one of my diapers (not a soaking wet full diaper, just a regular-one-pee diaper) started to leak THROUGH the membrane (not from the sides, but through the front of the diaper). As annoying as that was, i thought it was isolated.NOT. Now we leak everywhere. My daughter can go from a totally dry diaper to suddenly leaking from everywhere in just one single, tiny pee. Yesterday she went from being dry to having wet pants and a wet stroller in just one go.I'm taking the unopened boxes back to Target. We're done."
2,Liked them before but they started to leak,"We've been using huggies for the past year and really liked them, until the last 2 shipments. For some reason the diapers leak on the sides, as if the elastic was loose, but the diapers are on securely. We haven't changed the way we put on the diapers, and I noticed that the diapers we have now seem thinner and also the elastic is not as tight as ones from previous boxes we got. Will definitely be trying another brand after we finish this box."
2,Not as good as Pampers to us...,"We have tried all of the major diaper brands and keep coming back to Pampers. I found that the Huggies brands don't fit as well, don't hold as much and leak more than Pampers. My son is very tall for his age and Huggies don't have as much stretch or as the side tabs that let me really get the diaper wrapped as well around his waist as Pampers do. They make them sound good, but we did try them again recently (I had a coupon and we were broke!) and I was disappointed. The front has one large panel which makes it difficult to wrap around my son's waist well. And they definitely don't hold as much as Pampers do, which is a problem at night. During the day I can change him frequently, but that means we're using more diapers so it costs more in the long run."
3,very good diapers,"These diapers are very good. Only down side is that there are some defective in the box, that's why the three stars otherwise would have been 5."
1,Leaks,I purchsed size 6 for my son 2 days ago.(He's almost 2 yrs old) It's either I don't know how to put on a diaper (even though I have 3 children) because it leaks everytime and the diaper is not very wet. My son sleeps on his belly and yesterday morning and this morning I got up to see his pants and shirt wet because it leaked in his sleep and again the diaper wasn't all that full.This was my first and last time buying this product.What I liked was that the tabs have elasticity to them.
5,Fantastic Diapers,The Huggies Little Movers diapers were fantastic for my daughter. They never leaked. She wasn't able to pull them off by herself either.
1,"INCORRECT FIT Using Amazon's ""make sure it fits""",I'm very disappointed as well. This does not fit my vehicle even though I used Amazon's make sure it fits.
1,Wrong information,"When I ordered two of these air cleaners, I confirmed that they were correct to fit my vehicle. Using Amazon's ""make sure it fits"" is incorrect.Now that its to late to return them I'm stuck.Fram CA7597 Rigid Panel Air Filter"
3,Questionable design?,"Unit works well as advertised but the bed locking screw should be on the other end of the base. The brass rub guides with their locking screws, as I use it, are on the tailstock side, and the screw that locks it to the bed is on the back side. Makes it awkward to tighten it to the bed. If you reverse the unit then the headstock is in the way of the three locking screws as I use it quite close to the headstock to support clock arbors while turning pivots."
2,not new material. . .,"This book describes will how moral choices can save us from victimization. The parts about holiness or ""positive energy"" as a defense against people who would use us through physical means is also good advice. The thoughts on how to achieve a state of holiness are crude to non existent. The book also neglects to show us the very phenomena that the book's title advertises.If you are looking for a book that tells you instances of people avoiding physical threats, the you will appreciate parts of this book. However, many authors have illustrated adequately these situations and in my opinion in much more completely and appropriately. As for the phenomena of psychic vampirism, the subject is not adequately addressed."
5,Great insight!,I feel that there are many energy vampires out there. They are those who drain you every time you are around them. I have found this a helpful book to help me not be so effected by those who are out there who does this.
5,A fun and entertaining documentation of the relatively unknown occurrences that shadow the lives of many of today's celebrities,"Celebrity Anecdotes: Funny Stories About The Stars by J. Julian Payne is a fun and entertaining documentation of the relatively unknown occurrences that shadow the lives of many of today's celebrities. From who got expelled for mooning his teacher, to who's fart was sold on eBay, Celebrity Anecdotes is packed full of random facts sure to make the reader laugh and reflect. Highly recommended to the general reader, bust most especially to connoisseurs of modern entertainment industry and celebrity gossip."
2,It's ok but...,This is a decent mousepad for the price but after 4 weeks or so of owning it the cloth cover came off leaving me with a sticky black square of rubber. You get what you pay for I suppose.
3,Good for its worth,"It's a cheap mousepad and good for it's worthHowever using it, it didn't have much attraction to the ground so it slid everywhere and its materials were like cardboard."
3,Not that good,The mouse pad does not really lay flat on the desk. I bought other mouse pads for the same price which were much nicer. Look elsewhere.
2,Ok if you want cheap!,"Very cheap mouse pads, ok, but not something I would purchase again. kind of like a black cardboard for the mouse :)"
2,Not tacky enough - slips around on desktop,"The mouse surface is nice, but this mouse pad is virtually unusable because it slips around on the desk. Most mouse pads have a rubberized or slightly tacky bottom, but not these. You end up holding your wrist down hard to keep the pad in place while you move the mouse around. Not comfortable. Also, the mouse pad is warped up slightly, so every edge is off the desk.Fortunately they were inexpensive -- so inexpensive that it would cost more to send them back than the refund I would get."
3,Pretty good book,"I was pretty pleased with this book. It's a very clear, easy to use, step by step guide. I really like the spiral format."
3,"nice enough, but not quite......","I liked the spiral binding, but it would have been better had there been room to actually write in it. This is a reference book, not a journal book with memory-joggers to help you along. If you buy this one, better buy a nice notebook to go along with it, so you can actually write something!!!"
5,An encouraging guide,"I've jump-started many a Senior Citizen into telling the stories of their lives by turning them on to Mary Borg's WRITING YOUR LIFE. That's been a pleasant & encouraging surprise. It's exactly as the subtitle says ""easy-to-follow."" It's also light on the lecturing & language, & the spiral bound edition let's you lay it out flat as you work on those memories."
5,Vandas & Ascodendas & their Combinations with other Genera,"This book offers a concise description of all vandaceous orchids, with wonderful pictures, descriptions and differences between each genera. I am a grower of over thiry years, and have not realized that there were so many. I find this book to be more friendly to the average orchidist and if I could would give it a ""10"". This is truly the best on the market today."
4,Excellent Vanda resource,"This is a great book on the Vanda alliance. It has many wonderful pictures of both species and hybrids. It even includes a bunch of botanical prints (artistical renditions) of a number of species. This book is great for the hobbiest or breeder. Many pages go into detail about the history of breeding Vandas, and what qualities certain species impart. I have used this section a number of times when creating new hybrids. I have also used to book to identify an unkown Vanda, what a relief!"
3,Book lacks color illustrations,Very sad to get the book and find the illustrations in black and white. Hard to imagine why a book this expensive could not have had color illustrations.
1,doo doo butter,NEVER watch this movie. ever. I've seen a lot of bad movies and this tops them all. this movie will make you want to die
3,Hard to tell pieces apart from each other,Remeber to uswe the shift key to view the numeric value of your pieces.
5,Great recreation of a classic strategy game!,"I purchased this game in December of 1999. I am very pleased with this game. It has animated battles that are very entertaining. Also, the on-line playing option is exceptional--with a lot of challenging opponents from all over the globe!If you are looking for a great strategy game and a lot of tough competition, this is a winner! If you buy it, look me up on the zone!matt_da_brat"
5,Great!,I had ordered this book before and it was so good and the service was outstanding so I ordered one for a friend.
4,A Safe Choice,"If you are looking for a respectable, straightforward guide to Asperger Syndrome then you will be happy with Tony Attwood's well written and thoughtful offering. This book is one of the best sellers on the subject, and has remained popular despite many similar books continually coming on to the market. It covers diagnosis, social behaviour, language, interests and routine, motor clumsiness, cognition, sensory sensitivity, and frequently asked questions, and includes helpful summaries of practical advice at the end of each chapter. It is easy read but still a very comprehensive introduction, and while it focuses mainly on children, it can be relevant to adults with the diagnosis too. It's not perfect, but nonetheless I consider this book to be helpful and sensitive, and if you are the parent of a child with AS and you are only going to read one book on the subject then this one would be a good choice."
5,Can't put it down,"I love the book. It arrived in a timely fashion and is in great condition. Also, the book itself is a terrific read with great, practical suggestions, and is very thorough. Highly recommend the book for practitioners!"
4,Aperger's Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals,This is a good book to help you better understand asperger's syndrome and high functioning autism. It defines the basic symptoms and discusses areas that are problematic. Goes through some great social skills techniques and career ideas too.
1,Would like info about adults,Where are the books for adults with this condition? Do people with Asperger's just disappear? I don't think so.
1,The harm that inaccuracy brings,"I'm sorry to say that this book was quite inaccurate in the portrayal of patients with Asperger's. I have Asperger's and very few of these things describe me. My hand-eye coordination is fairly good, my eye contact is normal, I know how to tell if people are even slightly irritated with me, I can pick up on social cues and I CAN carry on a conversation WITHOUT interrupting or babbling incessantly about some trivial topic on which I am fixated. Thank you for your time."
5,"This book helped me to ""step into"" my child's world.","This book has a wealth of information in it. It is not ""heady"" though.It is a must for parents or care-takers of aspergers kids.It sheds some light on the mysteries of some of the behaviors of these kids. It helped me to step into my childs'world. I know I will refer to it again and again...it is like ""gold"" to me."
5,Highly recommended,"I have Asperger's syndrome, and would highly recommend this clear and sympathetic account to anyone who wants to understand what Asperger's syndrome involves."
4,An AS Bible,A must-have for any AS parent or educator. If you're not much of a reader - look for Tony Attwood's video of the same title. He covers much of the material (superficially) during a lecture on this tape...
5,Life-saving!,"I didn't realize how much I could depend on a book! It's like an instruction manual for children with Asperger's Syndrome. I plan on passing it on to each of my son's teachers every year, so they can understand him better, and therefore teach him easier. Thank you, Tony Attwood!"
5,This book deserves a six star rating.,"When I received Tony Attwood's book on Asperger's Syndrome, I had only a few minutes to glance through it....or so I thought! Surprisingly, I could not put it down! As a retired speech-language pathologist, I highly recommend this book to parents, educators, medical specialists, friends, and neighbors."
4,DVD Does Not Have Songs from theVHS Format,"We had the VHS format for Mike Mulligan and Steam Shovel when my 19 yr old son was little. There was a cute song called ""No Steam Shovels Wanted"" as well as a couple of other catchy tunes. Sadly, they are missing from the DVD version which I recently purchased for my 2 younger sons. However, the story as per the book is still the same, and the DVD includes 3 other stories: ""I Stink"", ""Trashy Town"", and ""Dot the Fire Dog""."
4,Final closing: LTV,"Coke works at Hazelwood closing chapter on demise on steel in entire region. Read also: Homestead, with new forward by author, best one-town summary"
2,Poor Form,"I did not read the previous reviews and I am paying for it. The ""Two Volume"" set is a false statement. I only got one volume. Beware!"
3,so-so,"Obviously you'll quibble with some of the selections or rankings, which is probably the point of a book like this. A short synopsis of each film or some stories and trivia are included (example: Toto the dog from 'The Wizard Of Oz' made $125 a week in production; the munchkins made $50). Some nice behind the scenes photos are another highlight. Not an incredibly insightful book, but good to pass an hour or two."
2,pretty bad movie,This movie was mindless shakey camera garbage. It may be because I watched the english dubbed version so if you really need to see it watch the spanish version. The english voice over actors were really bad.
3,doesnt play on US dvd players,"Yeah, I don't actually know if the DVD is good because it won't play on my American DVD player."
5,Didn't see this.,I guess the ex ordered this on my account. Guess I'll have to check it out. Looks interesting. Not much else to say.
4,(Rec) 1,I have been reading that Rec1 and Rec2 are good but I do not like subtitles. Was this also made in English? Alot of people did not like Quarantine because they compared it to Rec 1. Please let me know I would love to this.
3,didnt realize it was uk...,"it is the same movie as quarantine, but in a different language. lol i felt so silly when i realized it. :) but the movie isnt bad. :)"
2,totally redundant,"As I understand it this movie came out before Quarantine. I have seen both based other reviews that this one was much scarier. There were differences but they were so slight that I was bored throughout the entire movie since I already understood what was happening. The disappointing part is it was all totally in spanish I has to change the settings to watch it in English. And there was a lot of hand motions that didn't belong. And it was like watching an old japanese movie that had been dubbed. Their mouths were moving but the words never matched. I sugest if you care about these things. And paying attention to them would irritate you durring the movie, then forget this foreign made film and go American. I enjoyed Quarantine much better since I wasn't distracted by all the other glaring irritations as I was in Spanish version of of a decent horror flick."
1,An Absolute JOKE,"It is genuinely shocking how much international attention and positive acclaim this ""film"" has received - it is awful. Please, please do yourself a favor - if you'd like to pop some corn, turn the lights off, and enjoy a REAL found-footage cinema experience then watch ""Atrocities"" and/or ""Lake Mungo."" This ""film"" is garbage.I gave it one star for the look of the 'thing' at the end."
4,Handheld spook,"I had watched 'Quarantine' so watching the Spanish original (with subtitles) was not all that thoroughly exciting. Still, one can't deny that this one led the way in handheld spook and provides some effective chills and thrills.Must watch if you are a fan of this sub-genre...Try 'Grave Encounters' too if so.."
2,Not worth the time.,"I rented this from Amazon and felt that I wasted my time and money for the following reasons:1. The whole thing felt staged (forced acting, bad directing, shallow and predictable story).2. Barely over an hour long (you need to do better than an hour in my opinion if you expect me to pay full movie prices).3. Not scary in the slightest bit. In fact you could call this boring. I found myself on the verge of nodding off at points!4. Absolutely God awful English dub!!! I would have rather Amazon had the original with English subtitles because this dubbing was plain garbage!Save yourself the money unless you want to have a good laugh at a poorly done ""horror"" movie."
2,suffers from couldashouldawoulda syndrome,"interesting plot and good effects couldnt make up for repetitious dialogue and unending camera shaking. hello people, its the 21st century and the steady cam has been invented. story is this; a face and her cameraman do a piece on the local fire dept. they accompany them to a call; woman is ill and in need of assistance. seems simple enough. what starts out as an ordinary call turns into a nightmare for the entire building.the build up was decent enough and the acting wasnt deplorable. hard to pin-point where this lost me at. there was too much of something and not enough of something else. i dont think they could have trimmed it anymore than the 80 minute run time and i doubt making it longer would have helped either. i dont know, this just didnt do it for me."
1,Amazon instant video version is dubbed,"Skip the Amazon Instant Video version of this movie. It's dubbed. Kind of funny for the first 5 minutes if you're a fan of old-school kung fu movies, but not worth watching if you want to experience the impact of the original film."
5,HooAA!,"If you don't own a region-free DVD, do what I did and get one here at Amazon thru it's various marketers. I got a JVC that is both region free and converts PAL to NTSC - and it was cheap. That said, this is the type of film that made my purchase of a region-free player, worthwhile. With the pending release of the american ""version"" of this film (and those who prefer the asian version of Grudge, The Eye...etc know what I mean)I was not overly hopeful this would come to us in our local version. So I bought the import and have been VERY happy with the film. just think 28 DAYS.........after drinking a whole case of RedBull."
2,I did not care for the dub,"The dub is simply awful. I tried to watch for about three minutes but the voices were so out of sync and badly matched with the characters I couldn't do it. I just purchased it and feel like I wasted 3 dollars. I'm actually going to rent the spanish version and have no idea what is going on, rather than trying to listen to this terrible voice-over."
1,Better time spent taking a crap.,This movie was so horribly bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. Even by my standards. I want my time back.
3,Are you all on DRUGS? The American version is MUCH better!!!,"The American version is MUCH better, despite what the feedback here shows. To my mind, the positive ratings here must be the result of some concerted effort to ""stuff the ballot box.""Why is the American version better?Better pacingI Too many boring little interviews in this original version---MUCH better pacing in the one with Jennifer Carpenter (despite the dubbing, you can tell she's the better actress, too).(I also don't remember yawning at about the :25 mark in the American version.)But, hey...YOU decide."
1,This version is dubbed,"As another reviewer has mentioned, this version of the film is dubbed and NOT, as I had expected, subtitled. If you're cool with that, fine, but after watching about 5 minutes of the dubbed version I couldn't take it anymore. It just looks jarring and silly, it's much easier to take the film seriously when watching with subtitles..."
1,Horrible phone,I have 2 of these phone and they are like 6 months or so old. They both cracked in the same spot then totally fell apart. Sprint would not replace either of them unless i paid $50 or more. Very bad cheap phone and it's one of the newer ones.
3,A640 needs help,"I changed phones when adding my mother to my account. At first, I liked this phone, but the more and more I use it, I wish I would have kept my other phone. One bothersome thing: when I receive a call, the phone displays the wrong time - displays the time of the last call received or made. You have to turn the phone on and off to clear the memory or something. Another problem: one does not have the ability to tailor the hot keys on this phone as you can with other models. I'm stuck with this phone until I reach my anniversary date and can trade it in. :("
3,Meh...,"It works, but it was much more beat up than expected. I think the price asked for was too high for the quality."
2,Powers Off,"I received this phone as a replacement from my old phone when it's screen went out. It would be a good phone, except it powers off at random and I get maybe 10 minutes notice when the battery is dying. It's no wonder it's offered in Sprint stores as a free phone with service plan. It's not worth trying to market to the public."
1,Disgusting!,"I have read many books since purchasing my Kindle. I appreciate the free books and other offers and therefore downloaded this book based on the description and reviews. I have never written a review before, but I am compelled to share my opinion on this one. This book is simply disgusting! The actions and plots described here have nothing to do with romance or love. I wish the descriptions would have given a hint at the sadistic scenes. I will be avoiding books from this author in the future."
5,Not your ordinary historical romance. Lots to keep you interested,"I was expecting an ordinary historical romance. I only hoped the story would have enough going on to keep it interesting. I got a lot more than I expected with this book! You'll travel along with the beautiful thief Madeline as she runs away from Europe to Texas. She encounters more than she bargained for along the way. Love, kidnapping, a evil Mexican war lord and there is even an evil step-mother. This book has a lot going on, yet the author put it all together in a way that kept me engrossed in the story all the way through. I really liked it a lot."
4,CAPTURE THE NIGHT,The novel's plot is well thought of and unusual. Capture the Night was fun to read and hard to put down.
4,Fun and entertaining,"I really liked this story and it's multiple cliff hangers. It was a really fun read and had some new and interesting story lines. It was a little too gruesome for me in the end and I admix I felt a little queasy inside, but I kept reading and finished."
4,Primo Viaggio SIP (Toffee),"Couldn't compare with any other infant seats because this is my first one...A bit on the heavy side, even for a male, to carry around...A bit pricey, compared to other infant car seats...Cool colors to match strollers, nice fabric, excellent safety rating, but then again, so are other cheaper infant car seats..Overall, you're paying for looks and the prestige of having an infant car seat that costs more than others, except Bugaboo...It's like buying an Acura over a Honda and Lexus over a Toyota..."
5,Great Hobby Glue,"If you are a hobbyist, and need a quick drying clear glue, this is the product for you. I build model airplanes, and this is a lightweight clear drying product which is powerful enough for my applications especially in high stress areas like the wings. I would recommend this for general use, and modeling."
2,Doesn't do the job,"I bought this to repair a broken toy for my daughter. It didn't come close to doing the job. It may work on some materials, but definitely not on plastic."
1,Didn't work,Bought this to fix some kitchen stools whose crossbars were wiggly. Followed the instructions and it was as if I hadn't done anything. I'll be using Gorilla Glue or Elmer's carpenter glue next time.
