3,"Good, but not universally compatible","This seems to be a very good switch for the price. And it's definitely and upgrade from the 54G wireless that I was running before I put in all the cabling! BUT, for some reason I can get it to run a gigibit connection on my PC. From everything I've tried, I think the DLink Green or Auto-Sensing tech is incompatible with me Realtek gigabit PCI card. If I leave the card on my PC setup as Auto-Sensing, it continually connects, then boots me from the network - it's almost like it can't get an IP address through the switch, it's so odd. Anyway, I change the PC card to 100Mbps Full Dup and it works great. So, yeah, it's nice to have a wired network, but it would be nicer to have the full gigabit speed that my devices are capable of. I'll probably end up selling this DLink on CraigsList and trying a Netgear or something else..."
2,Poor quality,"The unit have hard time to work at gigabit speed.I was fully aware before the purchase that this switch won't work at gigabit speed if even one device connected to it doesn't support it. That's fine, since all my devices are (supposed to be) Gigabit ethernet.The truth is that it doesn't work at all. Even with all the devices at GbE the switch can't handle GbE speed.My data transfer between computers are exactly the same as my old 100Mbps switch..."
5,Worked as advertised...,This is a good Gb switch at a reasonable price. It does not seem to generate much heat.It seems to work correctly with Jumbo frames up to 9000.Not much else to say about it...
5,It Just Works!!,"To think that one can have Gbit ethernet in the home/small office at such an affordable price is just amazing to me. This switch really gives you no other option for high speed network connectivity. I also own a linksys 8 port and a netgear 8 port and both of them have had the same issue, requiring me to power off/on to restore connectivity. That being said, it could be a bad NIC somewhere on my network. However, I now own three of these 8 port D-Link switches and I have not had to power them down once.There's really no reason to post pros/cons. This switch offers a complete management-free switched environment that performs up to expectations. I would definitely recommend buying this for any home and/or small office. Especially, if you transfer large files such as videos and/or music and image collections. Also great if you have a central backup repository for PC's/Macs."
5,"Cheap, fast, reliable","My title pretty well sums it up. Cheap, fast, reliable. Not to mention easy to use. I just plugged it into my existing router (which was full) and presto! Room for more devices!"
2,Not Compatible with all my equipment,"While this D link works fine with my Toshiba Laptop, I can't get it to function with my 802.11g HP C4385 All In One Printer/Copier, or my Ifit Module for my Nordic Track which all worked fine with my Netgear Router before. It won't accept the 64 digit Wap security code this machine puts out, and seems not to be able to find the B band which this should also be putting out according to the settings. Compounding the problem is in calling the help center, and not being able to understand the Indian Techs they are so fond of hiring. I spent 25 minutes frustrating both of us with every other word being pardon me, or excuse me I didn't understand what you just said. I will never buy another Product that doesn't have local help center access, instead of overseas. I have ordered another Netgear router, and this one is going in the closet where it best serves everyones needs, or I have someone I want to frustrate by giving it to them as a gift."
2,disappointed in the GOLD DEAL,"Ive look at the reviews, and this switch seems to be good compare with other for the price. I was a little disappointed in the gold deal by amazon. If you search newegg you will find this available cheaper (37.99 shipped AR)and you dont have to hurry to order it within the four hour ""SPECIAL"".Some dont like the review caz i mainly took into account the price. sorry to bad, price is a killer for me. ""GOLD DEAL"" should mean something."
2,Not reliable,"This had worked well for a month or so. Later, it started showing negative signs. While using, the traffic drops in between. Slowly the ports stopped working entirely. Technical support was not good enough to help me out. For the price quoted I was expecting better product."
5,Groovy,"Works great... good price. What more can I say? (granted I didn't do any super geeky bandwidth testing, but works fine)"
5,Great and low price,"I am using Jumbo Frames 9K with no problems through this switch. Getting transfers over 110MB/sec from Synology DS1010+I like the status lights showing whic ports are gigabit speed. I actually prefer the layout of this switch for my desktop use; lights in front, ports in back. Please note the layout if you plan to use it in a more ""rack mount"" style arrangement.Also, do follow the 5-4-3 rule (wikipedia has it listed as ""Ethernet Way versus IEEE Way"") if you expect reliable network communications and before posting reviews stating you are having issues with multiple hubs involved."
5,I love invisible tech!,"So few things are truly plug and play these days so when I can say that I haven't given the router a second thought since plugging it in, it speaks volumes. I only feel the need to measure performance of some tech when it doesn't perform as expected and I haven't had to do that once with this switch. If you love set it and forget it tech I can highly recommend this product."
4,Very solid gigabit switch but...,"This switch does exactly what's it'd designed to do. And does it very well. One of the features is power management - automatically shuts down inactive ports to reduce energy consumption. This is supposed to be a good feature but when combined with the same feature on other devices, it becomes bad. For instance, I had my HP laserjet printer plugged into on of the ports on this switch, and when the printer is on power saving mode, the switch senses no activity from the port thus it shut that port off. The end result is that I can no longer print until either device is reset (turn off and turned back on). I ended up plugging the printer directly to the router to fix the problem."
2,it all depends...,"...which hardware version you have.as one of the user reviewed, only hardware version 2 does not throttle back to 10/100 when you have mixed network. i was hope against hope that it's been a long time since the switch has been out, so i'd probably get a newer version of the hardware. but no luck.first i tried the following(cat6 cables):router(10/100) ---> dlink switch(giga) ---> dlink nas(giga) + pc (giga)then i tried(cat5):router(10/100)--> dlink nas(giga) + pc (giga)basically, with and without giga switch in the middle, copying the same file from nas to pc, both took the same amount of time, and window shows the same speed. checked switch, it has hardware version c1.so i guess it's all depends on which one you got. you can save yourself the trouble by skipping this one or bet on your luck."
5,Great little switch,I picked up this switch because I needed to extend my network to hook in a few more wired devices.It works perfectly. I just plugged in the other devices and they see the internet. All the devices can see each other. Pretty simple.
5,1 Gb Switch Great Price and Support,"D-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop SwitchMost home wireless networks run out of ports. This product allows you to keep adding more ports without slowing anything down up to 1 giga bits per second.What more can you ask at this price, with Prime shipping and D-Link support?"
5,Just as it is advertised,"No problems, Hooked it up with cat 5 out of each port behind a Linksys firewall. Perfect."
2,very preachy little book,"I'm thinking Berenstain Bears = FUN! But this book is just a dreary collection of cautionary tales. Too much TV, too many sweets, messy rooms, watch out for strangers, EVERY chapter is more alarming than the rest. I bought this book to read amusing little tales to my 4 year old, not to preach and scare the pants off of him. Truly, if they wanted to change the title to something like ""The Berenstain Bears Tell You What's Good For You"" then that would be one thing...I could have avoided it. But ""Big Book of Stories"" just seems like it's going to be a random collection. Buy the individual books, skip this. Or consider yourself warned."
4,Call Of Juarez,Good graphics and most of all it has a great story line. If you like westerns then Call Of Juarez was made for you. It has to be the best western available at the present time. I would highly recommend it to a friend.
3,Read why it gets 3 stars,"Ubisoft a while back pushed a big sale for DRM-free versions of some of its games. This game gets 3 stars because while it deserves 5, it came with a serial code and a serial checker prior to allowing itself to install.That is NOT DRM-free. Thankfully Amazon keeps your serials in an easy to find location, but Ubisoft, as good as their games are, just doesn't have a clue. Thankfully for true drm-free, there is GOG ;)"
2,Graphics and gameplay from the Stone Age...,Really not sure why people like this game. It's like a time machine back to graphics and gameplay from 2001.Skip it.
5,Highly Underrated,"The most underrated game this year. Excellent graphics. Fun gameplay. Very good story (as far as stories in video games are concerned). The writing and voice acting didn't suck, which is more than I can say for 95% of the games I've played."
4,Enjoyable,"This is an enjoyable game. The story is engaging, and the game play fun. If your looking for a western diversion get this. It is not earth shattering in any technological way (as it appears to the player), but it is a lot of fun."
3,"Good Game, Great Price","I played the second one first, Bound in Blood, which was a better quality play. This one isn't bad, but Bound in Blood is playable over and over. The vendor I purchased it from worked out very well."
2,Not for me,"I just don't care for 'race against the clock while jumping through hoops' types of games.I tried too many times to 'sneak out of town' and got killed every time.Although I did enjoy ""Gun"", this game was just too difficult for me."
2,disappointment,"I expected a game that was more fun. The part in getting out of town never did work. I was in the right passage, but could not get over the fence into the next section. I then read that the mother was murdered. The game needed to lighten up and a little humor somewhere would help."
3,"Great game, great story line.",This game is real good. The only thing is that I felt that the game isn't long enough. I played it for 4 days and then I finished the whole game. That kind of disapointed me but the game is great.
4,Call of Juarez,"I thought the game was pretty fun and a different take on the ""First Person Shooter"" genre. It was a litte too easy, but it has some very cool graphics. I especially like the bow and arrow as a weapon. Overall...a very entertaining game."
3,"Somewhat fun, for a short time","Its an ok concept, but there's alot of time spent hopping/climbing around like its Super Mario. Its also completely linear, so replay value is very low."
2,Not So Good,"Lousy graphics, dumb story, not very fun at all. However, no freeze-ups or hiccups. I played it for a while and then just gave up on it. Instead, buy ""Call of Juarez: Bound In Blood"" - now this is a fun, worthwhile game to play."
3,Decent Game,"It's a decent, older game. I was looking for something to save me from boredom for a few days and I was able to buy this with a $5 credit I had."
1,disappointed,"When I received this art kit, I was very disappointed. The wood of the case was split in the back, and the screws that were supposed to be holding the lid onto the box were not present. The wood on the lid itself appeared to have come from two separate pieces of wood- and the glue used to adhere the two pieces is still visible. I have not yet used the art supplies, but I am hoping they are of much better quality then the wooden box."
1,It's disappointing.,"My opinion: very sad. It's disappointing. The DVD features only 6 of Paula's 16 music videos. Coincidentally, the only music videos on the DVD are Paula Abdul's #1 hit singles... in which she only had six.The DVD had been rescheduled for release multiple times.After waiting as long as we have for a DVD collection with all of Paula's videos on it, frankly this is a disappointment.Why not put all 16 videos on DVD?"
2,Simply not good enough.,"I really enjoyed Paula Abdul's videos back in the peak of her popularity, particularly ""Opposites Attract"" and ""Straight Up"", so I figured I'd buy this and be satisfied. Then I popped in the DVD and saw right away that Arsenio Hall was blurred throughout the ""Straight Up"" video, which was very distracting and a little disappointing. Perhaps it was an issue of rights, but if whoever released this disc thinks that we don't know by now that he was in that video, I feel sorry for them.Sadly, the highlights of this DVD were ""Promise of a New Day"" and ""Cold Hearted Snake"", simply because they seemed to be the only ones untouched or edited.The lack of ""The Way That You Love Me"" and ""Knocked Out"" was disappointing, also. In all, I give it two stars and hope that Paula later releases a collection I'd be content with."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Paula Abdul rocks, but whoever was in charge on putting this medicore compilation together needs to get fired and has no place in the music business... Com'on, only 6 videos, many of her hits still missing... blurred brands in videos! Rush Rush is cut out! What a sloppy job.I will give it a star for the high picture quality of the videos, that's all.Disappointing all the way..."
3,Only 6?,"It's nice, but why added only her 6 US #1's???? Paula is one of the best females in the world who has amazing videos, i wanna have full collection with her 16 videos!!!!"
1,disapoint,"I am one of the Paula's fans who order this DVDit contain 6 songs,straight up, forever your girl, cold hearted, opposite attract, rush rush, promise of a new dayonly 6 videoes from the 2 earlier album6 out of 16 videos she made >.<Paula, is this the way to treat your fanwe all had been waiting for this video collection for such a long timethe quality of not good, i dun think this is DVD qualityand there is sth weird about the aspect ratio of the last song, promise of a new dayshouldn't it be widescreen version, and they just ......destroy such a good videoyuck , i love to watch Paula dance but I don't like this DVD"
5,"If you are a Paula Abdul FAN, this is a must!",I was looking for Paula's videos on iTunes and couldn't find but a few. Then I found this DVD that has 6 of her BEST videos and at an average of $1 each I thought I'd order it. I was really glad that I did! I really enjoy watching these videos from the very late 80's and early 90's!!!!!
3,Straight Up,"An enjoyable collection of Paula Abdul hits. My favorite song was ""Straight Up"" and I've always loved the ""Opposites Attract"" video with Paula interacting with the cartoon cat. ""Cold Hearted"" was a rather sensual dance number. ""Rush Rush"" was a surprise to me because I did not know it was Paula who sang it back then."
4,A nice collection.,"Well, I had owned 2 of Paula Adbul's VHS collection and this DVD has MOST of the videos she has made. There are NO extras on the DVD, but the videos play fine (I was surprised ""Cold Hearted"" was done in Widescreen/Letterbox). If you're a purist fan of Paula Abdul, you may not want to get this DVD, but it does contain some of her better videos from her first 2 albums."
4,A BLAST FROM THE PAST !,"THIS VIDEO GREATEST HITS OF PAULA ABDUL.IS LIKE A BLAT FROM THE PAST AND SOMETIMES WE NEED THAT.BECAUSE WE WILL NEVER SEE THESE VIDEO'S ON THE TV MUSIC VIDEO CHANNELS.{AND THAT IS A SHAME}BECAUSE THEY MAY SEEM OUT OF PLACE NOW.BUT AT THE TIME THESE WERE THE HOTTEST VIDEO'S OUT THERE.AND PAULA ABDUL WAS A GREAT DANCER AND A BIG PART OF THE LATE 80'S AND EARLY 90'S.SOMETIMES PEOPLE FORGET THAT;OR DON'T WANT TO ADMIT THAY WERE A FAN OF HERSBUT YOU DON'T BECOME WORLD FAMOUS WITHOUT FAN'S.AND THESE VIDEOS WERE A BIG HELP TO HER ALBUM SALES.AND SHE DID HAVE A LOT OF HIT'S(GOLD+PLATINUM).SO PICK UP THIS DVD IT IS A GREAT PRICE;COMPARED TO MOST DVD'S OUT THERE.PUT IT IN THE PLAYER AND FOR 30 MINUTES PRETEND IT'S 1990 AGAIN.MOST PEOPLE WHO PUT THIS DOWN SEEM TO FORGET IT IS FROM THEN. [A FAN OF THE 80'S AND 90'S] {ROME,NEW YORK}"
3,Expensive,"...But since there is such a lack of Pagan children activity books out there, I went ahead and bought it anyway. It's a nice book to have for your children, my daughter really likes it. Since it is so expensive, though, my suggestion is to make copies on your printer. My daughter didn't want to ""ruin"" the book, but happily colored away on the copied pages. Now that she's older, she's more willing to color the pages directly in the book and I have copies for my son!"
4,Great book!,"Very good book for all beginners wanting to learn more about the world's greatest and largest cities. This book also discusses the history of many of these cities along with their social geography. Overall, a very good read!"
1,2003? seems more like 1950,"This book is poorly written, full of factual and gramatical errors, and suffers from what I would nicely call ""eurocentricity."" The book blames the problems of less developed countries on the populations of those countries and does not discuss the effects of colonialism or neocolonialism. I was expecting an unbiased, interesting, enlightening text on world cities, history, culture, and urban systems, what I got is a lot of population ecology and an unabashed advertisement for globalization and the IMF."
4,Learning and Using Natural Foods Daily,"This undersung book is a precursor to many of the more ""modern"" natural foods cookbooks; e.g. C. Lair's ""Feeding the Whole Family."" But what is a treasure in this book is Mary Estella's experience both as a gourmet chef and a mother, teaching how to not only make delicious meals but how to organize and do it expeditiously. The book has beautiful photos, a practical section on cutting vegies and even how to sharpen a knife and set up a kitchen to cut and prepare foods.Nightshades are used in the book, but can easily be eliminated from the recipes, IF desired. This is a treasure especially for those first coming into contact with whole foods. This book, coupled with Lair's book, or Rebecca Wood's ""The Splendid Grain"" or ""Whole Food Encyclopedia"" gives a firm foundation to your kitchen."
3,Affordable addition to your cooking library.,"This book is easy to follow and contains some interesting, tasty sounding recipes. Many of the recipes are adaptable for those on a healing diet."
4,Cyclo Memory Cooler,"It is a good product, but I think that he should throw more air, Having more RPM in the fans, and this way it would cool much better.On the other hand, the aspect tunning and the super silent fans do of the Cycle Memory a big product of Thermaltake."
1,not worth it!!!,"first off the cooler was $6.90 shipping was $7. shipping should not be more then the product. second the thing didn't fit in my case. it hit my video card, and its not even a big card just standard size. the clips are not strong enough to support it once the case is up right, hence it hitting my video card. you'd be better off glueing a fan to your memory then buying this thing. but the light look cool. the shipping was not slow, but it wasn't fast 5 days after 3 day Processing."
3,More Inverse...,"If you're still interested in that flat chested, wildly acerbic child- errr Woman. and if you can indulge her in all those Dragon Slave explosions. Then this here is the treat for you!"
1,RATING IS ON PRODUCT QUALITY NOT ON QUALITY OF SHOW,I don't know if I'm the only one having bad luck here. I bought this as a gift to update their Slayers collection to DVDs. The brand new DVDs were already scratched upon opening causing the DVDs to pause frequently. I returned the item to Amazon.com for a replacement which was quick and easy. The replacement came about a week after I submitted the return request. Once again the new DVDs are scratched though not as badly. This has never happened to me before at any store.
5,Truely a Hall of Famer,"Scooter never disappoints. We should all be so gifted. Some people may not see the poetry, but just ask White or Seaver - they know"
5,"Keats, Byron, and now, Rizzuto","This literary gem is destined to be handed down from parent to child for generations to come.Long before there was politics, or correctness, there was Phil Rizzuto. Rizzuto ably scoops up the essense of morality and ethics and fires to first with more deftness than Shakespeare, or that guy from Ireland (I can't remember his name--not Joyce, though; it was somebody else.) The poem we always relate and remember around the old campfire--when we go camping, and we have a fire, is the story Scooter tells in the honored oral tradition of Homer: of live-trapping squirrels in his attic and then letting them loose somewhere over by Yogi's house.No doubt Rizzuto will forever be linked to the other great American Poets: Frost, Angelou, and Walden."
4,"Nice drill, great quality, professional product.","I received the drill (a bit banged up as it was a refurbished model) but in good order. I am not a professional construction worker, but need a quality drill for some work around the house. The drill is lightweight and powerful. Recharging the battery is quick. Leaving one on charge all day helps with the recharging. The quick chuck exchange is easy to use. I've purchased drills for the company I work for and this one easily compares to the Makita's that I bought for the factory. If I were to consider buying it again, knowing now what I know about the drill, I'd still buy it."
5,Good . Read,This was better than expected. Would definitely recommend.Sometimes it's difficult to write a long review. I would suggest reading it.
3,"Good Reference and well written, BUT....","Presents a good overview on most of the elements. The basic edition is realy the same as the Advanced edition but with some of the Transition Metal stuff tossed out... I wouldn't buy the Adv. Edition, unless the school was shoving it down my throat... Not that this is bad, but I think that there are WAY WAY WAY better books on the subject of Trz. Complexes and Mechanisms (Spessard comes to mind in the fantastic ""Organometallic Chemistry""). It is undeniable that FA Cotton can really write well and that the man is a genius on the subject, hell the guy lived through the glory years of Inorganic, but the book never really shows people what really happens mechanistically in the book... Everything is presented in an encyclopedic fashion, which sometimes makes things ambiguous... I think that this is a landmark of a book, but one that is really a first reference on a particular subject..."
3,The title suits the book:it is Very Basic.,"A very simple and very basic book. Overall it is a good book, but it is just not for me."
1,Showed up Broken,I ordered these for my son's science fair project and they arrived snapped in half. Extremely disappointing. If I wanted to spend $20 on smaller pieces I would have done so.
4,Stout but stiff,"OK, guys have nipples too. The front part (everything past the leather) is a very stiff weave - I had to move them well away from my nipples to avoid having them cut in (hard). That said, they are also very durable, the clasps are functional and hold well. The elastic is on the back straps below the leather only, and seems to work well. I bet these would hold up a reasonably apportioned tool belt as well as they do my carpenter jeans with square, leatherman, large tape and razor knife in them.Added plus: Suspenders with no belt = much more comfort for those of us with no hindquarters to support the weight in our pants without cinching up our belts like a python killing it's prey!If plumbers wore these they wouldn't need longer shirts!"
2,Not what is pictured,Received these quickly but I am disappointed with them. They are not what is pictured. They red webbing is two different shades compared to the top and bottom straps. The leather diamond in the middle has some company lettering advertising all over it. Makes it look like a marketing freebie picked up somewhere. Very disappointing.
1,wasted money,I was not aware that there were suspenders that had no elastic in the front. They are very difficult to put on and my husband refuses to wear them. Wasted money.
4,Durable and Bright,"I received this one time and it's a really nice color. I bought it just for an outfit I was putting together but they really do seem ""heavy duty"". The material feels strong and it's heavier than a normal pair of suspenders."
2,Elastic broke after a few days,"My husband is 6'4"" 300#. After wearing them for just a few days the elastic all frayed and broke in the stretchy part. I gave it 2 because the clips are strong and he's still using them because we can't find another one that works. He also likes that the over the shoulder part isn't stretchy."
1,Delivery,According to the tracking information i recieved this item but i actually did not. The supplier should consider sending via FedEx or DHL so the delivery has to be signed for. This would make someone accountable should the customer not recieve their goods.
2,"Too-Short, Live Performances","This CD was like attending a concert comprised of medleys or abbreviated songs. Thusly, James Brown's performances here left me with an incomplete experience. Just as I began enjoying a song, it would transition into another."
5,Satisfied my replacement needs for my electric generator.,"I own a Hyundai generator (new model) and wanted to have spare parts for future use. This particular plug was hard to find, and so I ordered from Amazon.Plugs came quickly, were pre-gapped, and appear to be high quality (haven't yet installed this particular one).Would recommend!"
4,If you can find it - enjoy it,"... It is one Steele's more gripping novels. It started slow for me - only in that I had to guide myself into Steele's alternative history and get used to Presidents McGovern and Dole. I had to convince myself that Neil Armstrong was NOT the first man on the moon. These were just minor distractions. However once I figured it all out, I became totally entrenched in this book. He breaks up each chapter with a newspaper article or television report that provides a chronological alternative history to the space program. I liked that idea. It gave it more believability. There were a few unexpected twists and turns toward the end, which I won't give away..."
2,Not enough details on the alternative space program,"Sorry, I wasn't satisfied with TA. I was looking for more specifics about an alternative space program that started in the 1940's. Instead, I got a silly plot set ahead to the 1990's with a disappointing ending. If you are looking for hard details about an alternative NASA and its accomplishments, try Stephen Baxter's ""Voyage""."
4,snowcap,"A little dated but still a good read, if you enjoy strong, opinionated, always right men! If so, you'll love the sparks shooting off the two main characters as they determinedly stomp into each other's personal space. The others members of the family add a delightful mix to complete an entertaining read."
2,Confusing and Too Academic,"I must say I was very disappointed with this weighty tome on Chinese grammar. It's authors insisted on quoting every previouse Chinese grammatician to such an extent that it proved difficult to read between the lines. Granted they try to cover a very difficult subject but the inclusion of 'wrong grammar' examples only further added to the confusion as I tried to read this. I am sure there is some useful information to be gained form this book, but be warned you will need a lot of patience. This is something I have not!"
3,brain pain,"This is not for the regular student of Chinese. Too muchtechno mumbo-jumbo. If you are a linguist, then good. Mighthelp with specific questions. I think the Routledge grammarbooks are more usefull to the student. ""Basic Chinese: A Grammar and Workbook"" seems great so far. There are also ""Chinese: An Essential Grammar"" and ""Intermediate Chinese: A Grammar andWorkbook"". I hope to get the other two soon. I also lookedat ""Practical Chinese Grammar"" and it looks very good. Itis a companion to the ""Practical Chinese Reader"" series.These other books seem to be a better place to learn fromthan this heavy scholarly book.Zain jianZhu Ni Hao yun"
3,"Good for syntacticians, poor for computational linguists","I have owned and used this book for about 6 years. The coverage is good, and there are detailed descriptions and discussion of each of the pheonomena covered. The greatest strength (for linguists) is the diagnostic tests used to demonstrate what lexical/grammatical category a word or phrase belongs in. The weaknesses are that a) it is not concise; b) everything is presented only in romanization; c) The descriptive terms are sometimes odd or outdated seeming. For example the chapter on ""de"" postverbal phrases has some long, strange title. To readers of current linguistic literature, these would more handily be classed as ""resultative phrases"" to capture the similarity with phenomena in many other languages. If you want a succinct reference/descriptive grammar (for example for developing computational linguistic applications) ""Essential Chinese Grammar"" by Yip and Rimmington is a better choice."
1,Just not perfect,"I bought this ""Functional Reference Grammar"" just because I wanted to own one concise grammar with plenty of examples and clear explanations of some complicated chinese grammar parts. It was a big surprised when I found out that in Chinese grammar book are no Chinese characters. It is quite obvious it makes the book nearly useless because Chinese language cannot exist without Chinese characters. I didn't explore the book anymore and I do higly recommend ""Modern Mandarin Chinese Grammar"" by Claudia Ross."
1,Not worth buying,"Title is deceiving. This is nothing more than an advertisement. If you are looking for helpful information about guitar finishing, look elsewhere."
4,Mountain Lion,The movies is a great game but unfortunately there is a flaw and the game does not work with Mac Mountain Lion. I contacted the makers 'Feral' and they talked me through some trouble shooting which didn't work.They then kindly gave me a pin to download an extended version of the game. I'm stillWaiting to see how it goes as it ate up my download allowance at only half way do have to wait until next month.Aside from this though- the actual game is very fun!
2,Good game Bad support,"The game was fun to play but the company the put out the game does not pay attention to it, I have a brand new 24 inch i mac loaded and the game had weird graphical issues that there seems to be no patches or updates to fix it, It got so bad that i couldn't even play the game. Oh well, for now i will stick to windows for my pc games."
4,Clean bass.,This bazooka tube fit my needs. I wanted a small package that packed a punch. The dual voice coil allowed me to hook this speaker in parallel with my amp. This 8 inch speaker fills my car with clean bass that adds to my music but doesn't dominate it.
4,Tony Soprano on Management: Leadership Lessons Inspired by America's Favorite Mobster,"If you like the TV series, and Tony's Management, this is a book for you. Leadership and effective management. I know Tony Soprano is not exactly a ""Role Model"", but leave his business aside and just explore ""the chain of command"".Well written, easy reading."
1,Cigar time? Please......,"Of all the wasteful themes, this book takes the cake!!! Who would want to learn lessons from a mobster? A 'friend' suggested I might think it was funny---and I do! While the author seems to be writing tongue in check for most of the time, it makes NO sense to put such a character up as an icon for management success!!!!!"
5,Nuggets of Management Wisdom,"Schneider has mined nuggets of management wisdom from the first four seasons of Sopranos episodes, and he cleverly uses quotes, anecdotes, and vignettes from the show to illustrate his lessons about management skills such as delegating, negotiating, and giving praise.Tony Soprano on Management has additional attractions, if you're not a Sopranos fan. The book includes an excellent chapter offering advice on how to manage up (that is, how to influence people in management positions above you). There are also plenty of case studies and traditional advice on good management practices, along with worksheets to help readers identify their hot buttons or concerns and plan future corrective actions.Kathy GradenSociety for Technical CommunicationNovember, 2004"
1,Disappointing Copycat,"Once a concept takes off, others jump on the bandstand. The idea of using fictional characters to give leadership advice is not new. This author tries to use the actions of mob boss Tony Soprano to teach management. Unfortunately he falls very short. His examples ring stale and reworked. As a management practioner, there is no way I'd use what he has to say. He misses the mark by a mile. Save your time and money. It has already been done much better."
1,I Was Robbed!!,"I thought this book would offer me something new---along with insights gained from one of my favorite characters. I was robbed! The suthor IS slick--and summarizes some great 'Tonyisms', but what he knows about business and management wouldn't fill a gnat's eye. His applications are forced, trite and very old. Nothing new here. Guess it takes a real manager to write a real book about it. All those reviewers who told how it saved their businesses must be in a business world other than mine! What a rip off!"
5,"Smart, Funny and Clever","It's a great book. I love the Sopranos, and I've often thought that Tony's management style could go a long way in today's overly circuitous business environments."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not what I expected, from the cover forward. The cover image shown on amazon is not the actual cover of the book. There are a few outstanding photos intermingled with some great photos and some mediocre photos. The layout and design of this book could have greatly enhanced the content. The format is too small for the number of photos, giving it a cluttered appeance and overwhelming feel when reading. I was not looking for a ""pretty"" coffee table book, but I was looking for something visually stunning, informative, and inspiring to my own work."
1,Deceptive Description!,I ordered 7 SETS of these . . . your item says $1.99 and shows an image of FOUR forks. Instead I received 7 individual forks instead of the 28 I expected. Now days away from my event I have to figure out where to find more of these or something similar. PLEASE CHANGE YOUR DESCRIPTION TO STATE THAT THE PRICE IS $1.99 FOR EACH FORK.
3,underdeveloped and outdated,"This review refers to the 1965 Hardcover version of the book.It's quite apparent that the 40 years that have passed since this book was printed have very much dated it's content. The definitions of many key concepts (such as an ideal) contain the right ideas, but are not formulated in the modern viewpoint. These, however are only minor setbacks. The main flaw of this book is its subject matter. There are 11 chapters, and it was not until the eighth that the ideas start getting deeper. Even these last 4 chapters do not delve very far into the heart of things.The text is written with the reader in mind (almost excessively so). Useful equations are clearly labeled and the steps in the proof are clearly outlined, though sometimes to an unnecessary degree.I would recommend this book for a mathematics hobbyist, or perhaps an undergraduate number theory course. For anyone with a stronger background, they wil not glean much."
3,A Strong Introduction,"Proceeding from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, into Fermat's Theory for Gaussian Primes, this book provides a very strong introduction for the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student to algebraic number theory. The book also covers polynomials and symmetric functions, algebraic numbers, integral bases, ideals, congruences and norms, and the UFT."
4,Pleasant reading,For the experienced mathematical person this book is very relevant and nice to start with when digging in algebraic number theory. Basic knowledge of algebraic number theory is also in the book coupled to a lot of exercises.
5,Senior BMET,I got one of these a few years ago. It's works great. Great size. Plenty of power. Great battery life.
4,Worked Well to Replace Hospital Bed Mattress Cover that Ripped,"We rented a hospital bed for an ill family member. The mattress that came with it had a cheap plastic cover that ripped within a couple weeks. It was also really noisy, which this one is not. We replaced it with this one which was for a much deeper mattress -- but, we inserted a 3"" deep Memory Foam Mattress inside and it fit fine and made the bed ever so much more comfortable and protected the previously unprotected Memory Foam. Air out the vinyl cover for a couple days before putting on the bed. The vinyl smell goes away pretty quickly if opened and aired outdoors, or somewhere where the scent can dissipate."
4,matress protector,A little bit too big for a XL twin mattress but worked well and was easy to put on.
4,Nice experience>,I recieved this set in one piece and I am very pleased with the quality and workmanship of this set.
2,Quiet but cord does not retract after 2 uses,"Pros:Extremely quiet, the dog does not even barkGood Suction.Cons:After two uses, the cord does not retract.Difficult to slide on carpetHose got clogged once with combo of run and dog shedding."
1,We thought we were renting the movie - wrong,"We thought we were renting the actual move ""Titanic."" This was more background info.Total waste of money for us - just beware."
5,Good Book,"I read this book a few years ago, it was very gripping, kept me entertained until the end. Recommended it to a friend and he liked it as well, definitely worth a read."
5,WOW!!!,Finally someone has produced a unique and extremely helpful tool for skaters and skating coaches. This CD manages to convey performance enhancing messages that are believable and invaluable to the serious skater. The music is upbeat and fun. Ms. Loundagin and Mr. Mitchell have really put together a quality product. I'll be on the lookout for future editions.
5,Best facial exfoliator!,"This product is the best exfoliator I have ever used! It's so refined & removes all the dead surface cells without leaving your face red or raw like other products can... it's a very gentle, yet effective, exfoliator. It's defintely worth the extra cost!"
5,Easy peezie lemon squeezie,"My favorite line in the movie is ""easy peezie lemon squeezie"". All ages will LOVE this movie even if you don't like golf. The little kid in the movie steals the show. Great family film."
5,"Very good movie, inspiring","Very inspiring movie about a boy who stands for who he is and doesn't let the big shots get in his way. Learning to play golf and going to the top. Also the learning of respect in the family and the relationships between the members of the family and the consequences of everyone's actions in the learning experience. It's not just all about golf, it's a great movie."
2,Are you kidding???,"Could have been such a great movie, such interesting people involved, great story, instead we get a typically inane, over-simplified cliche-saturated Hollywood pile of ..... I did like the lighting and the visuals quite a bit myself, as well as the actors playing the English golfers and the lead character's parents, hence the 2 stars. The rest of the acting and the script and direction was high-school caliber at best in my opinion. Shia La Boeuf (not sure of the spelling) could not have been a worse choice---seemed like the male hero of a movie made for kids, and bore no resemblance in any way to the man his character was based on. Real disappointment for me---i was really looking forward to this."
3,Not bad,"While this movie is inspiring, it can be a little boring at times, and unless you have a long attention span or really like golf, you may not be able to sit through the whole thing. It has a little humor in it, but it's by far not the most fast-paced or humorous movie. It has a couple of cuss words in it (I only recall about three of them.) Even though it's a little slow, you should rent this movie, because you see how perserverance really works, and it's inspiring. When you rent it, you can fastforward too, if it gets to where it's incredibly boring and you're about to fall asleep, but I advise you to at least view this movie once."
5,One of the Top Ten of 2005,"Based on a true story, this is a first rate retelling of an amazing event in the sporting world, not just golf. Expertly weaved into the plot are the themes of social status, sportsmanship, and integrity. A feast for the soul..."
3,The previous review,"Whomever wrote the previous review was obviously not a golfer or did not follow the movie very closely. I have not seen the movie yet but want to get it. But, you would think that that person would at least know Quimet was American and not British..."
1,"Oh, no! Not another class-warfare story!","This is a tired and threadbare tale that once again attempts to show the inherent nobility of the poor but honest working class versus the aboslute rottenness of the idle wealthy. Why Disney feels that audiences want to be force-fed any more of this liberal clap trap is beyond me, but judging by the number of positive reviews in this forum, perhaps the studio is right: there's always a market for a trite, predicatble story in which the stuffed-shirt aristocracy gets its come-uppance from a working class underdog.Unfortunately, neither the rich nor the poor in this story are very are very likable, and it's hard to feel much empathy for any of them as they plod through life. Viewers will do well to heed the advice given by Ouiment's 10-year old caddy, Eddie: ""Keep your head down."""
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This is an absolutely wonderful movie! The story is true. The videography outstanding. The acting superb! If you haven't seen it, buy it. If you have seen it, buy it."
5,"An all-around enjoyable, uplifting movie.","I rented this on a whim after seeing Stephen Dillane--whose work I've taken an interest in since his fantastic portrayal of Thomas Jefferson in the HBO miniseries ""John Adams""--on the cover. I wasn't sure whether I'd really enjoy it or not, since I've never been much of a golf fan, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The story and characters are engaging and the movie has the usual Disney combination of humor and drama. Dillane's performance as Harry Vardon was great, but Shia LeBeouf also shined in his role as Francis Ouimet. You don't need to be a golf fan to enjoy this movie. I actually liked it so much, I'm planning on buying it now."
5,Inspiring Movie,"I'm a big fan of movies that are based on true events. This was very inspirational, motivational, and I thoroughly enjoyed how the range of characters were portrayed."
4,Greatest Game Ever Played,"The Greatest Game Ever Played has a great cast, from the 20 year-old ""Mr. Francis Ouimet"" (Shia LeBeouf); to the English legend, Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane). Other characters woven into the story create a minor masterpiece. Of course, the caddy, Eddie Lowery, just simply steals the show. This is a true story to touch the hearts of golfers and non-golfers alike!"
4,The Greatest Game Ever Played,"This movie is a little heavy handed on the social-economic class issues. At times the story drags because of this. However, the casting is solid, and the cinematography is lovely. Best of all is the real life story of Francis Ouimet. Inspite of knowing almost nothing about golf, this movie has inspired me to research the real person.The Greatest Game Ever Played: A True StoryThe Bonus feature showing the interview with the real Mr. Ouimet is a definite plus."
4,rising star,Hadn't seen this til yesterday. A pleasant surprise. Today the young hero named to play in new Indy movie. He looks like he has the stuff.
4,Good but truncated version of the book,"As with most screen adaptations, this movie lacks the detail of the book. But what's in the movie is well done and fairly true to the book. Virtually all of the characters are consistent with the mental images that I created when reading the book (except for Francis' mom, who is much too pretty in the movie). Eddy the caddie is a stitch!Congrats to Disney for making a good family film about a real story. You will like the period landscapes, clothing, and golf. If this movie grabs you, go buy the book - it's five stars.Things that I didn't like or were left out:- The Open was portrayed as Francis' first competition - he had fair experience in amatuer contests before- Francis and Vardon shared hard scrabble youths, would like to have seen more of that."
3,The greatest good from The Greatest Game,"The Greatest Game Ever Played is certainly not the greatest movie ever made. It lacks a little in sense of purpose and in character development. We were also disappointed by gratuitous foul language. But overall we were delighted in the charm of the true story it portrays. It is quite clever in its use of special effects to enhance the otherwise boring experience of ""watching golf."" We were able to use it to talk with our children about the power of pursuing your dreams. In all of these comments, we'd say The Greatest Game is quite similar to the movie Secretariat."
4,inspiration for the true golf fan and player,"Good family entertainment and an inspiration for golf fans or players. Have watched it twice while my son, who has just taken up golf has watched it 4-5 times."
4,"The usual Hollywood distortion, but not a bad film.","It's pretty much inconceivable that Hollywood will ever tell a true story in a completely accurate way. A certain amount of dramatic license is forgivable, and probably even necessary in order to compress the story into a couple hours. Even fabricating a sub-plot involving a fictional love interest is okay if it doesn't take over the film.So, despite the historical inaccuracies in this movie (with regard both to Francis' personal life and the details of what occurred during the Open), this is an enjoyable film that captures the spirit and the essential facts of this classic David and Goliath story."
5,A good Golf movie for all,"This movie, despite some reviews, is a very GOOD Golf movie for anyone. It really surprised me because it was one of those movies that keeps you on your toes and doesn't let you guess what will happen before you see it. Shia LaBouf (From Holes, I Robot, Even Stevens) does a very good job playing Francis Ouimet, the star of the film, a boy with a dream to play his idol, Harry Vardon, on the U.S Open Championship. This DVD is a good buy for the price, and since it probably would be very hard to get at the library (Everyone wants it. I had to wait for 92 people in front of me before I got it) you might have to buy it just to watch it.Sincerely, RedHawk48. GO COWBOYS! GO DESPERADOS! GO WHITE SOX!"
1,One star is too much,"Don't wast your time with such a summary of dullness and ignorance. Please read a good book about ancient philosophy and don't bother Plato and Aristoteles.The silliest book I have ever read, and not funny either."
3,Sweet Enemy,"I thought some of the characters' arguments with each other and comments to each other did not make sense. However, I thought the psycology of the characters issues and reactions were right on."
4,sweet enemy,this book was added to my diana palmer group that i have collected our ten years. she is one of my favorite writers
2,Sweet Enemy,"First off - The hero in this book is a jerk and, such a wimpy heroine. She needs to fight back. Many of DP's heroines in her books are as such. Ah,Diana! No love scenes? No sweet talk? No warmth? The way he (the hero) treated her (the heroine), why would she want to spend the rest of her life tied to this jerk? I don't blame her. I would have run also. I am an avid follower of DP's writings but in my opinion this is not one of her better books."
2,"over, and over, and over","This song has been out since summer of 2002 in Spain. Ok, well, it's summer 2003, and they're STILL selling it?? It's one of those songs that, the first 20 times or so that you listen to it, it's great. I actually got the full CD when it was still an import from Spain. But now that I've heard it about 200 + times, it's getting just a bit annoying."
1,god almighty!,"dear me, the second when i thought they would have dissappeared from the charts, this piece of garbage was released. it's basically the same as the original, with some tinky bells added for the effect."
2,Renamed G'N'R,"After doing a cross reference with the original G'N""R debut album. I noticed that Velvet revolver is basically G'N'R without 2 of the the original G'N'R members and the old lead singer of stone temple pilots. I like both STP snd G'N'R, however i think that velvet revolver is nothing compared to these two bands. I feel that slither from the album contraband is the only good song and i was very disappointed with it that i got rid of the album a wk after i bought it now i just want a single of slither"
4,Nada mal para Fans de GNR y STP,"Un Saludo este Single no esta nada mal ya que tiene un tema raro en vivo que no esta en la version normal del CD. Una union de Guns n Roses & Stone Temple Pilots nada mal se escuchan sonidos de Guns clasicos como el sonido de Stone tambien, es un poco crudo el sonido nada mal un rock bastante bien creado es un CD de coleccion al igual que este Single hay un fan de coleccionistas de Guns N Roses que es en español y mencionan datos de Velvet revolver solo hay que subscribirse mandando este correo: polarworks_Collectors-subscribe@yahoogroups.com es en español y conparten en su web musica muy buena!SALUDOS"
1,doesn't do a thing,"Because it's a gel, it's initially cooling to apply it. Has a slightly bad smell to it. Doesn't do a thing for bruising or pain though. Simple massaging will help a bruise go away faster anyway. I have tried this for sprains and backaches but it did not help the pains."
5,Boiron Arnicare Gel ---excellent product!,This product is helpful for neuropathy and general arthritic pain. I have enjoyed using it for several years.
4,GEORGE THOROGOOD & DESTROYERS - VIDEOS - DVD,"THESE ARE FUN VIDEOS TO WATCH. JUST DON'T TAKE THEM TOO SERIOUSLY, AND LOOK AT THEM FROM A FUN & ENTERTAINMENT VEIWPOINT AND YOU SHOULD ENJOY THEM.

1,lousy camera,I bought this camera because it was relatively low in price . You get what you pay for. The room was well lit but I could barely see the image. Colors were blotchy. I will stick with logitech
5,FNL scores with an amazing episode,"""I wanna see my dad.""For a show that is consistently great (except for those horrible Jason Street episodes in the middle of season 3), Friday Night Lights went to another level in season 4 with an incredible hour of television unmatched in the history of the series. ""The Son"" deals with the emotional disintegration of Matt Saracen after being told his father was killed in Iraq by an IED. This is Zach Gilford's episode, and his tormented portrayal of a son who both loved and hated his dad is just brutal. Matt's father-son ""reunion,"" his dinner with the Taylors, and his actions at the funeral are among the best scenes the series has created and will haunt you for days. By the time the credits roll, if you aren't devastated or at least shaken then you don't have a heart, and if you don't have a heart you have no business watching Friday Night Lights. / RATING: Excellent!"
1,RIPPED OFF - Where are the last 2 episodes???,"This is a review for the Producers / Distributors of the DVD set.I gave this 3 DVD set as a present to a friend.We were both very excited to finally sit down and watch Season 4, which is supposed to come with 13 episodes.There are only 11 episodes in the boxset!The last 2 episodes are missing.Not happy. I would like a replacement."
5,Amazing Drama,"I read where some feel the series is regressing, I beg to differ. Times change, especially in a small town. People do come and go because some try to escape the small town for bigger and better things. So for me, this adds to the realism.The acting on this show is truly amazing for such a young cast. What a talented group of young actors. We'll be seeing more of them in other things I am sure.Kyle Chandler is so wonderful as Coach Taylor. He is exactly what a coach should be. A positive role model who has his finger on the pulse of his team, and a compassionate fellow who will go out of his way to help better the lives of his students. All the while fighting the system that seems to want him to fail.If you like emotional TV, and real life issues you can't, and shouldn't miss this show. Although it is Football that holds the people together, this series really is not a football intensive show. So you non-sports fans are missing out on something special for no reason :)"
5,"I LOVE the ""Friday Night Lights"" TV series, THANKS, Amazon","I waited YEARS for seasons 4 and 5 to come out on video. The minute I saw Season 4 listed as available I bought it, and pre-ordered Season 5 at the same time. Now I own all 5 seasons on video. I'd recommend buying all 5 seasons to anyone and everyone. One of the best TV series ever made, and 5 years of it just wasn't enough."
3,"Still good, yet not as riveting as previous seasons","This was recommended to us and it hasn't disappointed, yet the last seasons of the series do not hold the appeal of the former seasons. There is a lot of good acting by ""unknown"" actors and I hope this show propels them on to more acting jobs."
5,Thank you Netflix!,"During the last couple of weeks, I had the opportunity to watch FNL seasons 1-4 on Netflix. When I first tuned it in, I really did not expect much, but I was rapidly pulled in to this fine drama series. For the first time, I was glad to have insomnia!Season four was excellent. I think it was the second best of the four (the first being the best).I was extremely disappointed to find out season five will not be available (outside of DirectTV) until the Summer of 2011."
4,Wonderful gift for the grooms dad to give the bride,"This bracelet was our something new, something blue and someday maybe a gift to be passed on that will be the something old too! Very nice price and beautiful to look at. It looks like soft, satin ribbon & your shocked when you touch it & see that it is silver."
4,A must read for Ph.D. Candidates,This is a quick read that provides some of the best advice on controlling and writing the dissertation that I've seen. Much of the advice Bolker provides seems common sense but I've known few graduate students to use it without a guide like this. Applying her suggestions for writing and organizing will get you done with less agony.
4,Useful and logical....,"This book is very useful to a struggling student (like myself), yet it doesnt actually say anything that surprising. It basically says...sit down, shut up, and WRITE! It does talk about using positive reinforcement though, which might be useful to some. When reading the part about ""do some work then reward yourself with a phone call, or chocolate bar"" I couldnt help but think ""how about I don't write and just eat a chocolate anyway?"" I suppose it is working on the assumption that you have some self control and some motivation to achieve, or else you wouldnt be doing a PhD in the first place. With this in consideration, I do think it is a useful book, and even just reading it is somewhat motivating. I am still trying to develop a writing addiction though...Ill let you know when I start feeling withdrawal symptoms on my days off! I'd buy it again, coz there is nothing to lose, and a PhD is too important to risk."
3,Good Tips,"Writing a dissertation requires all the help and resources you can get your hands on; therefore, I recomment this product."
4,Quick overview,"A quick guide to write your dissertation. Moreover, practical for those who are overworked and have little time to write"
3,Dissertation Cheerleading,"I was hoping this book would offer insight into a mysterious, terrifying process. It has some helpful information, but is mostly fluff. I read the book in a couple of hours. I walked away with some hints (write every day, met regularly with your advisor)but nothing earth-shattering. I wouldn't buy it again or recommend the purchase. I threw it away after reading it."
5,Insightful!,"I bought this book while I was working on my own dissertation, and I found it very insightful and inspirational! It breaks down the process of writing a thesis from your ""zero draft"" to a final copy. Students will get over their writing blocks more easily when they understand the process of polishing such a large document.The author lists relevant questions which you can ask yourself at every stage, to help you get more organized. She also discusses how to work with a thesis support group, and to strategies to keep yourself going day after day. This is a much needed resource, for everyone who wants to write their thesis.Dora Farkas, Author, ""The Smart Way to Your Ph.D.:200 Secrets from 100 Graduates"""
3,Writing your dissertation......,Okay. Is a pretty good guide with practical information. I guess i was expecting more specifics however about the writing process.
2,Eh--- not so much,"I am a doctoral candidate and basically this book is not telling me how to write my dissertation and complete it giving 15 minutes a day to the writing (let alone the research) but really how to overcome blocks and start writing. Haven't we all been there, done that already? To me, this book didn't offer anything I hadn't already read, figured out or been taught. Perhaps it would be a good book for procrastinators, but not for me."
5,Good book for dissertation writing,"I am midway through my writing project, and this book has helped with tips on how to write, e.g. free writing, zero draft."
1,A disappointed PhD student,"Dissertation writers need a systematic approach of how to construct the dissertation and advice on how to do the critical writing not just writing tips that are designed for high school students. 15 minutes of writing is good for a student that has not been involved in writing at all. How could author expect a PhD student to write the dissertation in 15 minutes a day? Is it a joke? Dissertation needs structure as well as a systematic approach for doing literature review and critical thinking. It certainly cannot be messy as the author suggested. However, it will be messy if PhD student does not have the dissertation at the end of the term. As a new PhD student, I am extremely disappointed that this book had no original contribution and did not provide anything that I did not know about dissertation writing."
2,Idiot's guide to writing your dissertation,"That might have been a better title... The Idiot's Guide to Writing Your Dissertation... yes you idiot.The point is that this text is extremely simple. Good advice, but for true starters. If you have never written something serious, you need to read this, but if you have... skip it."
1,Codswallop and Claptrap,"I should've known better, but, being midway through my dissertation, I guess I'm vulnerable to some hideous distractions. This book substitutes cliches and platitudes for scholarship. The piece of advice Ms. Bolker forgot to give was one from 1066 and All That, and I paraphrase to fit the occasion: don't try to start, revise, or finish your disseration by writing on both sides of the paper at once.Save your money and sanity; search elsewhere."

3,"Devlin's Biochemistry, 6th edition","I expected better from a 6th edition medical textbook. There are still grammatical and sentence errors that need to be corrected, and we have found multiple diagram problems throughout the book. The sentences can be poorly worded at times, and the book occassionally makes leaps in thought that are difficult to follow. It does contain a large amount of information, which is good, but the presentation of that information definitely needs to be further refined."
3,vs. Stryer,"Fair clinical book. The Devlin just does not read as well as the Stryer. If Stryer is poetry, Devlin is a newspaper, informative yet not very moving."
1,Hmmm...,"I could not pull together the ""big picture"" for all the details. Major concepts can be easily forgotten, especially by me: by the time I had read 3 pages containing a pleothra of details, I found myself making many wrong conclusions about how the major concepts fit together. On the other hand, I am a second year medical student, and I have found that Lippencott's Biochemistry paralleled my course rather freakishly as the concepts were introduced in lectures in the same order as in Lippencott's. Obviously, this book was definitely made for someone who has an extremely high capacity for sorting things out...i.e., it wasn't for me."
5,"Shipped fast, and arrived as described.","It arrived exactly as described, and fast. New text book for less than half the cost."
2,Too detailed and wordy for medical school,"I just finished first semester medical school, and we used this book. The chapters read like a bad and verbose novel. With the time constraints in medical school, you really need a book that gets to the point. That's why the Illustrated Review Series are much better for medical school students. I will admit that this is a great book for graduate biochem if you're interested in research. Stay away if your in medical school and rely upon the notes and a supplemental book like Lipcotts. You'll get more confused reading this text b/c it's way too detailed."
4,Get your Ox fix here,"Who knew. This gem, which I ignored for 25 years, except for ""Fallen Angel"" and the title track which are on ""Thunderfingers"", showcases great music, John's distinctive voice, and a dose of good time rock and roll.My particular favorite is ""Sleeping Man"", with great vocal harmonies, bass licks, and Joe Walsh's distinctive guitar work. All of the other tracks are solid, and the CD includes the usual detailed liner notes with John's thoughts behind the songs. If you are a fan of his, you won't be disappointed."
4,A must listen...,"John's excellent bass playing on this recording is a standout as you might expect from The Who's long time bassist. However, I find his vocal ability quite appealing. ""Try Me"", ""Lovebird"" and ""Fallen Angel"" are three of my favorite cuts. Not to mention Joe Walsh's fine guitar playing. This solo effort is truely underated and overlooked! The Ox rules!"
3,JE's fourth-best solo album,"All the rough edges that you'd expect from the core trio of John Entwistle, Joe Walsh & Joe Vitale have been polished off. The result is listenable but not particularly memorable.Note that Amazon lists the title incorrectly. It's actually ""Too Late the Hero,"" not ""...for the Hero.""The title track is a fine mini-epic. ""Dancing Master"" is disco, even though it claims it isn't. ""Love Is a Heart Attack"" is fun, and vaguely reminiscent of ""Trick of the Light"" from ""Who Are You.""In short, it's not as good as JE's other 70's albums, but superior to his 90's albums."

5,Drawn together,It's amazing! It comes with a game and the best moments of this adult comedy cartoon. I recommend!!!
3,Could have been better,"Okay I recently watched this whole series on Netflix It centers around 8 cartoon characters Captain hero , Xandir , Toot , Princess Clara , Foxxy love , Ling - LIng , Spanky ham , and wooldoor All which are parodies of actual famous cartoon / video game characters ( Super man , Link from the legend of zelda , Betty Boop , Belle, Valerie brown , Pika chu , The evil piggies , and spongebob ) all living in a house together as part of a reality TV show . While the basic plot line of the of the show is interesting it fails to deliver anything it hasnt already done . Every joke is just the same one over and over with a little gruesome violence thrown in . The jokes dont seem to be written to make the viewer laugh but to shock and disgust them . Along with that the show is only 30 episodes long and gives on of the most pathetic and disapointing finales I have ever seen in a show ."
5,"Genious recording, ALR is phenomenol at finding the talent the world craves",You cannot find a better collaboration of songwriters and song selection on any other colaboration. Buy this album and share it with your music loving friends. You won't be disappointed.
3,"No other choice, be carefull when connecting the tracks.","No other choice, if you want to build something trucked its only one choice for reasonable price. but be careful when connecting the tracks. Ribbon might be damaged, good thing that if its connected its OK."
5,"This is an amazing item to buy, if you own a HD home theater system","This is kind of a must to buy if you own a Home Theater system that is capable of taking digital signal transmitted from an optic fiber cable.If you own a mac, you already have the headphone jack allowing you to transmit a red lighted signal (I'm not sure, but this is what I have heard...).If you own a PC, you might want to check. I own an old dv6000 laptop which has one of its headphones jack doubling as an SPDIF port to transmit the red lighted signal for digital audio.This item is used to connect a standard Optic fiber audio cable to your headphone jack which transmits the light."
5,Great item,"Bought this with a 12' optical to connect my macbook pro to my logitech surround sound and it works perfectly. Adapter is small, so be careful you dont lose it!"
3,Slides out of the port,"The audio quality is great - as expected, since it's digital.However, the plug keeps slipping out of the audio port on my 2008 Unibody Macbook. Very little movement is required to cause this. I have not had this problem with any other mini-TosLink plug or headphone jack in this computer. This results in a significant disruption to my musical experience.Pros: Right-angle design makes it much harder to break the plug.Cons: Slips out easily.I'll be looking elsewhere for a higher quality implementation of this product."
4,dated information; but good historical background,"Excellent review of linguistics, history and development of Hebrew from an expert in the field. Some of the material is very technical for the casual reader. An excellent starting place to study the history and development of Hebrew. Obviously a lot has changed in the world since 1969, but it remains a solid piece of scholarship."
5,Lost Jewel,"This book is a jewel. It has been out of print for over 20 years and it's almost impossible to find an unused copy. I bought a 1957 edition at Amazon which was in amazingly well preserved. Regarding the book, the author exposed the Hebrew language with a historical perspective and linquistic framework in a scholarly manner which does not bore. Highly recommendable."
5,Wonderful gift for a daughter,"This book was a gift to my daughter, who is very active in her church and it's Women's Group. It was well received and she has even conducted some classes for single women using this book. It is nicely interactive and lends itself well to an adult education classroom environment with chapter summaries and checklists for each chapter. Not for the cynical, this book is decidedly for those with a strong Biblical orientation...in fact it might even be useful in promoting and supporting belief in those lost in today's world."
2,Great Title Weak Content,"Loved the title of the book, but was not crazy about the content. Was looking for something with a bit more depth, not generalities. Stopped reading the book and just gave it a passing glance. Was disappointed in the lack of real life difficulties and realities."
2,Was it the mail service?,"I was very disappointed in the service. When I went to pay for this book I was told that if I place my order before a certain hour (on a Monday morning) the book would arrive by that Thursday. Well, the book arrived on a Thursday for sure but it was more than 2 weeks after the order was placed. I was not happy. This is not my usual experience with on-line purchases, but I was counting on this item reaching the address on a timely basis and it did not happen. Can't actually attach a rating, as I am still waiting for it to be forwarded to me."
5,Great eye opener,"This book is great for the person already dating as well as one preparing to enter into the realm of dating (or courtship).The 1st half of the book has quick tests at the end of each chapter to help you evaluate where you are, as well as advice and encouragement. The next few chapters are to evaluate your boyfreind, along with tests, and evaluations of where he is, as well as advice and encouragement. Then a chapter on your compatability (spiritual oneness) and finally chapters to evaluate how to walk away when it is not a good relationship, or stay if he is the one for you."
2,Okay 12v compressor - annoying fittings,"This is an okay portable 12v compressor. The connectors are 3/8, rather than the much-more-common 1/4 size, so if you have any other hoses or accessories, they're unlikely to work with this device. I found the included connector for tire inflating hard to use (compared to most others) and because of the straight geometry, I can't use it for inflating the small tires (such as on a stroller or child's bicycle)."
3,Cannot find a hose replacement as the one that came with the product dried out from being in the car.,The MF-1052 Air Compressor is a great product it's the fact that you cannot find a replacement hose for it. The plastic hose dried out from the heat and simply cracked and now is unusable. Is there any one out there that can find a suitable hose for it /
5,Amazing Product!!! Outperforms those small cheap compressors!!!,"WOW!!!I was skeptical when I found this, thinking I'm gunna pay over $50 for this?? Well, if you want to air your tires up quickly, then this product is definetly for you.I have a Jeep and I use this to air my tires up after those rock crawling trips.Great Product for the price!!!"
2,Good Emergency Device...If You Have Time,"Keep in mind that this is the same sort of compressor that comes included with batteries in more expensive, heavier units. Can it fill your car tires? Yes, if you can wait...and wait. It will not fill your car tires to 30 psi in just a few moments. It will get just over 20 psi and then it will bog down. It looks like a good grade electrical compressor, but it struggles at what it does. I have a 125-pound tank that I've attached these to and it never gets over 60 psi...and it takes a long time to get there. So don't expect miracles from this little guy. Small tires, okay, but larger tires, better get something better."
5,Great Product,This product is of high quality. Very sturdy. Plus it has a wonderful design. The price did not stretch our budget.
2,"Looked nice, don't fit.","To the naked eye, these should have been perfect, but they were just a whisker too narrow in diameter to go down over the socket part of my chandelier candles. One sixteenth of an inch more would probably been fine, Had to return them."
2,Nice Look but Didnt Fit,I received this item and was very excited when the package arrived. It took me a few days to finally get around to changing out the mixed socket covers that the previous owner had on the chandalier. I thought they were universal but soon found out that these were too small for the chnadalier. I was so disappointed so now I will take one off and go to local merchants to locate a replacement. Hopefully I can buy just one and then seach Amazon for the product that fits.
3,Decent for the most part.,Pro-Can effectively fit most materials needed to make it portable. Things fit well if you have the patients to put it altogether.Con-Can get really annoying if you are constantly porting it place to place. Also if you are planning to carry a deluxe package (add in all remotes and numchucks and a couple games) it is a bit small for it.Overall-Good if you are planning on bringing enough for two people with a couple games. You may need a second bag or disc carrier if you want to carry everything and the kitchen sink.
2,only for the basics,"If you have any more than the beginning Wii setup this bag will not hold it. I bought one for my son last year--he has 2 controllers, a wheel & about six games. The bag can't even hold this minimal setup. I'm going to try the G-pack this year."
2,Why can't they make a decent sized bag for the price?,"I purchased this bag to keep my Wii games and nunchucks in. I wanted an attractive bag in my family room, next to my Wii. I realize that is not the intended purpose of this bag. It is so small that with my 6 games (in plastic cases), and two nunchucks, it barely closes. The cardboard cased Links Crossbow and Wii Sports fit in the front pocket. Instruction manuals don't fit. Hoped my extra two guest wimotes would fit. No chance.The quality of the bag is fine. It looks nice. For the prices charged on Wii goods, give us some value. I wish I went I went to the local bowling alley and purchased a child's bowling bag to keep my Wii accessories in. They are $15, larger, and more attractive.The bag is not large enough for its intended purpose. I usually give high ratings. See my reviews. Not on this mini."
2,too small,"I suppose the bag does what it says, but in all honesty this thing is just too small. I bought one and promptly took it back and purchased a carrying bag made for a laptop that worked much better and ended up costing a little less.Fits what it claims, but really, who wants to take the Wii over to a friends with only one set of controls? Just poor design."
2,Small Wii bag,I received this item but I was surprised by the small size of it! The item is much smaller than that shown on amazon which is kind of upsetting.
2,Too Small!,"The Wii Messenger Bag is definately cute, I'll give it that. But, it's way too small. Controllers would not fit in side compartments like picture depicted. And if I put the wheel in the front compartment the front flap would not snap closed. With the console being so small, this would've been the perfect opportunity to make a roomier bag to hold things (like even the basics)more comfortably. Small console doesn't have to mean small small bag. My son is actually using his Xbox 360 back pack for his Wii. It's not designed for the Wii, which stinks, but he doesn't have to cram things in. My advice, purchase something else that's bigger, or wait for Nintendo to make something that's bigger."
2,bag ok,"The messenger bag is nice, but not quite big enough. There is no room for the base or for additional games."
2,Not what I hoped,"While the Wii is still hard to find, I bring mine over to play with friends on a pretty regular basis and hoped this would be perfect. But I have an easier time using a generic bag made for a laptop.For a bag that is specifically designed to easily & conveniently transport the Wii, this was poorly designed. Had it been just a little bit larger with a few extra pockets for a second Remote + Nunchuk and games, I would easily rate this a 4 or 5*. But it isn't, so I can't.UPSIDE -- It DOES fit most things if you're willing to work at it and toss a lot in the main compartment with the console, but I can do that in most laptop bags. And the padding is nice.DOWNSIDE -- I would have preferred 2 additional pockets for Controllers/Nunchuks, a pocket or wallet-style slots for a handful of game disks, and maybe a dedicated place for the sensor bar.Look for a better bag or settle for using a generic tote bag you already have because this design doesn't offer much. I missed opportunity."
5,"Fits everything inside safely, easy to carry","I bought this case despite a few negative reviews, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the reviewers were in error. This case will hold your Wii, sensor bar, video cable, AC adapter, 3 remotes, 3 nunchuks, and even some spare batteries. The only thing it doesn't hold is your games, but I think you're better off having a separate CD case for those anyways.The point being, this case is everything it promises to be. I packed our Wii in it for the holidays and then packed it with clothes in a suitcase. It survived the trip just fine. While out of town, I carried it to two different houses. The carry strap is reasonably comfortable, and the case kept everything secure for the trips.Overall, I'm very happy with this case. When you do pack it, just follow the diagram included with the case, and everything will fit with no problems."
1,The messenger bag is too small.,"The messenger bag is way too small. All I could get in the bag was the wii, two nunchuks, connections and the IR bar (which I thought would break if I forced it in). The remotes I had to put in the side pouches after I took out the batteries. I could not fit any games in it. I took it back to where I purchased it. Nintendo needs to revisit the carrying case department!"
2,Way to small,I bought this the other day to be able to travel with my Wii and I find you can barely find the basics in the case and you can't even fit a game case in it. I''m taking this back to the store you can barely fit everythng in it.
3,Oh yeah it can fit the Wii but...,"As for one I would say it CAN fit the WII in without forcing. But the thing I didn't like was you can't even fit any games in. If you were to try to fit any games in you would need to take the DISC out of the thing and slip it in their, for me I think the game would crack. You CAN fit the WII and ever other thing (Sensor Bar, Adapter ect.) in. The Wii has a nice slip in pouch that is easy to keep it safe. The Sensor Bar has a pouch above the Wii that you can slip it in (and the stand for it) but it could snap the Sensor Bar. As for the Adapter and the otherthing, there are two velcro straps to slip 'em into but it's impossible to get them in, so I find myself just shoving them in. Its terribly impossible to fit any Wii/GCN games in (Well maybe GCN, but not Wii) the case any ways.Overall A nice case to hold ONLY your Wii but you can't fit any games in"
2,poor strap construction,"The strap which attaches to the bag has comes out of the retainer. This has never happened to me with any other bag I have purchased. It can be put back in but leaves a sense of wondering when, and not if since it has, it will fail again"
3,rescue at Los Banos,This book is a good version of the events but does not have the same level of non-military background that a much earlier and now out of print book by Anthony Arthur does. Arthur wrote his in the eary 1980s when many of the participants could still be interviewed.
1,"AMERICAN RAP, MUCH BETTER","crap!!!! most of the rap francais artists are BUNCH OF CRAP!!!!! if u want to listen to french rap music just listen to 'rap mersaille' such as : ""113, booba, MAFIA K'1 FRY, etc..."""
3,Sanitized version of the CIA,"This seemed like a very politically correct version of the CIA. It never gets into the CIA complicaty with the drug trade from Cambodia to Columbia, or terrorist from Pinocet to Savak. If you want to think the CIA is not that bad get this. It is very long just not complete."
2,Bad Textbook,"This textbook was very appropriate for the animation course I bought it for. The lessons and information in the book included many good insights and points about art. However, the way in which the book was written destroyed one's ability to process the information. The text was heavy with metaphor and redundancy. Because the chapters are long and don't have summaries, the reader feels left alone in a sea of words, not knowing what is important or where the book is going with its points."
5,great art book for boys- and girls!,"This book had a lot of really fun art ideas that my boys loved. It is very hands on, and you can mix in science with your art. My history buff loved the art history, and this book inspired much online investigation and a planned trip to our local art museum. It is a great way to introduce your child to real art- but is also fun and ""crafty."" My high-energy boys loved this book, and I can not recommend it enough."
4,"Seems like a great book, but daughter not into it","This seems like a great book. I loved that it came WITH supplies, instead of being a book to give your kid ideas, and then make YOU go buy stuff for those projects. Our 11-year old is VERY into art, and we though she would LOVE this book for Christmas. But it didn't grab her interest at all. Finally, after it sat for several months unused, we gave it to a friend. Their daughter did seem to be excited about it."
3,a mathmatical cat?,"Hi I'm a Pima Community College student and, I read the book to a friend's daughter for homework. She loved the book because it was a cat doing and solving math. The book had a lot of short stories about Penrose doing math. Some of the topics she didn't get but, that was because, she was not to that level of math in school."
4,This Book Makes Math is Fun!,"A delightful book that introduces youngsters to mathematical concepts in a fun, painless way. Simple and interesting activities are included after each short story based on an adventure of the author's cat that include the abacus, binary system, fractals, origami, bubbles, triangles and more.This book is an excellent way for mathphobic adults to explore math with their children and learn right along with them!"
3,OK book,"Loved the explanation of binary numbers and the cat concept is cute, but all in all, I am not sure who is the target audience. My eight year old gets easily frustrated, and it is not entirely clear in each story/lesson what the point of the learning is. But since my daughter loves cats, and math, this is a pretty good book for the price."
4,7 year old math fiend enjoyed this book,My son really enjoyed this book for its interesting presentation of math.. he even named a cat puppet after Penrose.
3,Could be better.,"While I think the CD is valuable in that many mantras are compiled on it, I do think the quality could have been higher. The author does not identify the mantras before recitation, leaving the listener to figures which mantra is being chanted. Also the background instruments almost drown out the author's voice."
5,Lovely,"Beautifully shot, well done. The dialogue was well-written, realistic and relatable. Pop open a bottle of red wine and enjoy."
1,Sizing misleading,"I put this outfit on my daughter's gift list for Christmas. When she got it, I was disappointed. First, the color doesn't quite look like what is in the picture and second, the sizing is way off. This outfit is very baggy and much bigger than the size. I ordered a 4T so my daughter could wear this for a while and she won't be able to wear this for the next year or better. The jacket looks like it is about a 4 or 5, not a 4T. This outfit would be better labeled for husky kids."
2,Too hard to type on,"Keys are too small, especially the shift and space bar. It seemed that I had to constantly stop and retype everything because the key I hit didn't take. I had gotten a free keyboard at work for ordering some office supplies and I liked it ok. Not as easy to type on as a regular keyboard but good enough for every day use. I bought this one for home hoping for the same quality but was extremely disappointed. I would definitely want to try before I buy next time because there is a big difference in quality with this type of keyboard."
4,Make sure your frame will fit these fenders,beautiful fenders but my bicycle frame was too small. return shipping got me to a point where I could not effectively return these fenders. Not a huge loss I will try and sell them on Ebay but it would be nice to understand how they fit on the bicycle frames before I ordered them.
5,Intimate Fingerstyle Guitar at it's Most Beautiful,"The sound quality of this glorious guitar music, as well as the extraordinary warmth and beauty of El's playing, must be heard to be believed. Highly personal, this is music exquisitely rendered with heart, humility, tenderness and deep feeling. Truly luminous playing by a true poet of the instrument."
1,Don't waste your money,"I love Bonanza-its my favorite tv show. So one would think I would prrobably enjoy this book--wrong! Its not only dull, its totally inaccurate. Did the author ever watch the show? It looks like he read some bad fanfiction (the Calder books) and wrote his book from there. There is no excse for such poor research--and why the big price tag? It should be a nice coffee table book for that price. BTW, this book was totally unauthorized by the show's creator. I can see why!Spend your money on the Greenland book--its the best Bonanza book out there. More entertaining and much better researched."
2,"Painful, but diverting","For anyone who has ever been a bridesmaid, this book has a handful of entertaining moments. When you could not admit to anyone at the wedding that your dress was hideously expensive and uncomfortable, the bride was a self-centered, irrational witch, and you didn't want to be there at all, it's nice to read someone else's horror stories.None of this, however, makes up for the dully repetitive sentence structure, the painfully clumsy dialogue, and the lifeless characters. Books like this make me want to sit down a write a novel, because if this can get published, anything can."
5,A fun read...,"It took me just a few days to read this book. I enjoyed the authors style, sense of humor and the main characters quest for love while all her friends are getting married.There are scenes in this book that made me laugh and some that made me feel sorry for Cate, being the last single girl in her group of wedding planning friends. I liked the character of Cate, and thought she was written very well. She is real and flawed and funny.If you have ever been a bridesmaid, you will certainly relate to purchasing a hideous gown (or several of them) you probably will never wear again, the elaborate decorations of the weddings, the bachelorette party in Vegas and spending tons of money on a present for the happy couple who so considerately registered at Crate and Barrel for their expensive gifts.Great book, great author."
2,Mediocre read,"I am a fan of chic lit, but this one is a disappointment. The plot is predictable and the writing style is dull. Stick with the Shopaholic series!"
2,"drinking, blacking out, and acting like a high schooler","The fact that this was by a first-time author certainly shows. The main character Cate's habit of drinking, blacking out, and blaming the resulting consequences on booze and/or hangover is no more ""fun"" in a novel than it is in real life. Not once, not twice, not for the third time.I think attending AA instead of yet another snotty, self-centered ""friend's"" wedding would have made more sense.It's a bit silly for a kindergartden teacher to be ""scared to death"" of a kid's booger-- I'd say consider a career change if that's the case.The book's theme was drink lots, get drunk enough to pass out, attend weddings of horrible women, then act like idiot due to hangover or booze. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. And eat many burritos.Would someone please tell me what the heck is a ""schwartzky"" crystal? I don't want to confuse it with a Swarovski crystal."
5,I could not put this book down!,"This book was great, I read it in only 3 days after work! That is how great it is. For anyone who has been in at least one of her friends weddings you can totally relate! And for anyone who is ""always the bridesmaid"" you will totally appreciate every part of this book! Enjoy!"
1,"Trite Sit-com, plus alcohol, alcohol, and hangovers","The laughs were predictable, the characters were overblown stereotypes, (I could almost hear the phony laugh track repeating, as on a TV somewhere) and toward the end I thought I could hardly bear reading about another round of drinks. Do real people actually get drunk every time they have a social engagement? What a lot of wasted (pardon the pun) opportunities to really get to know each other, or to develop hobbies, learn something, or do good for the community. I prefer clever books that show how the main character uses her wits to overcome a situation. This main character seemed to live for a buzz, and had a serious lack of wisdom or wit. My one word summary: VAPID."
5,Always reliable,Have used this product on drafting boards (remember those?) for years. Am trying it out as a cover on a hollow core wood door that I have set up as a computer desk.So far it is working as expected.Eliminates the need for a mouse pad and is smooth for writing on. And it is easier to keep the computer area clean. Great product.

3,Leaves Me Hot & Breathless,"This is the first FIRM DVD I tried, and overall I have a blast with it. The second Cardio segment is my absolute favorite, with all the jumping and kicking! The two Sculpting segments are definitely more challenging for me because I only recently began weight-training with 5 lb dumbbells. In the end I feel energized from head to toe.My only issue is in the first Cardio segment Sue Mi quickly introduces a ""ski jump"" type of move that is fast and confusing, and never demonstrates how to actually do it. It throws me off each time even though I've done the workout a dozen times already. I end up continuing the ""four knee repeater"" during this and it's just as effective."
3,Good Total Body Workout,"I thoroughly enjoyed this workout, albeit the instructor did confuse some of the cues. Once you do it a few times you get the hang of it and you really feel the affects of the moves. My muscles feel great, and when you don't have a lot of time this is a good workout to do for overall body conditioning. I would recommend it in spite of the few missteps."
3,Cardio Quickie,"This is a good workout for a cardio quickie. Its a 30 min workout thats definetly gets your heart rate up. Sue Mi is a decent instuctor, she miscues once or twice. OK workout overall."
3,I didn't see the negatives that these other reviewers note,"I want to preface this review with that I would have given this workout 3.5 stars, however that's not an option.I bought this DVD in a package with other FIRM DVDs, and I'll admit it's not one I would have bought on it's own. However, I found it to be a light but challenging workout, and one that could easily be interspersed on days when my muscles might still be sore from, say, an extra-intense workout the day before.This is a good one to get the blood flowing and work total body, but fit in on a busy day."
1,Horrible,"This DVD is so complicated it is not for the ""Average"" woman. You have to be an aerobic instructor to be able to keep up with the constant changes and add ons! I feel that I was completely ripped off in purchasing it. I called the firm's customer service number and they would not give me a refund as I did not purchase it from their site. I would never purchase another one of the Firm's DVD's!!!"
3,Okay for beginners,"This was a nice, low-intensity workout that would work for someone new to exercise. There was too much ""take it from the top"" for me to really have fun with it, which is a shame, because it could have been so much better!"
2,Not what I was expecting,"The title of this video turned out to be a bit misleading. I thought it was going to be along the same lines as Cardio Party. It seemed to me it was more sculpt than cardio, and what cardio was there was low-key. Yes; It gets your heart rate up, but so does Hi-Def Sculpt, and that one is all sculpt.This is the first video I've done with Sue Mi as the lead. Her cueing is different from the other girls. She cues fast with little demonstration of the move. There were several times I found myself standing there staring at the TV. I'm sure it will take several times through the video to get the steps down.I own serveral of The Firm videos. I think this one will be something I go to on days that I'm tired and don't really have much energy to put into a workout.If you are wanting a good cardio video from The Firm, I recommend Cardio Dance Fusion with Alison Davis. This one will get you sweating!"
3,I'm bored,"I've never done the FIRM workouts before. I'm a huge fan of Jari Love and figured I would do FIRM workouts during cardio days. What a bore. While the instructor does do a nice job of explaining the moves there were a few that I'm still confused about. I'm used to a bootcamp cardio style from the gym and if you are too, this will be incredibly boring for you. I hope all the other FIRM workouts are up from here."
3,"Great workout, annoying instructor","I love the firm. This was my first workout with Sue Mi. The workout definitely gets my heart rate up and makes me sweat. It is very enjoyable. However, I will never buy another video with Sue Mi as the lead instructor. She is incredibly irritating. She talks WAY too much, doesn't cue very well, and her voice is so high pitched and irritating I can barely stand it. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the actual workout. I just have to watch the video on mute with other background music."
3,nice review but rather pedantic,"i bought this book for a class on speciation. however, as a botanist i was somewhat disappointed to find 70% of the papers cited throughout the book related only to drosophila. coyne and orr's personal research deals only with drosophila so this seems like their bias on display. they also use superlatives more often in relation to their own work than anyone else's. though it's a harmless habit, it can become annoying and detract from the rest of the content of the book. the book is a probably the best review of major developments in our understanding of speciation in the past several decades, but it isn't perfect."
4,Good Introduction,I felt like this book had a well planned and consistent lay out from start to finish. The authors present a topic then discuss competing theories and then provide both experimental and field data that may support or refute the different theories. Most of the research that is mentioned is only mentioned in passing but at least it gives you a place to start. On the whole I felt like it was a good introduction to the science of speciation.
4,Highly Recommended for Portability,"Although this tripod is limited in its functionality, it is extremely lightweight (1.6 lbs) and folds down to about 14 inches which is what I was looking for. It also holds up to 3.3 lbs and seems to be built relative well for its size. I originally looked at the ultra compact tripods which have the telescoping legs (like an antenna). Although they are smaller and lighter, they don't hold has much weight and the legs look like they will eventually break after limited usage. As someone stated earlier, this Sunpak would not be your main tripod but a second tripod you could take on hikes, tours, etc where carrying a heavier tripod would be cumbersome."
4,Good all around coveralls,These were a gift for my father and they have served him well for many different work activities. It was great that they came in a shorter inseam.
1,Useless,"I purchased this phone through AT&T; and it has been nothing but a headache. After receiving it, the Sync worked for several hours, then, abruptly, it could neither receive nor make calls.I took it to an AT&T; store and they explained to me that the Sync sometimes has problems recognizing sim cards. They installed a new one. Again, it worked for several hours and then stopped being able to make or receive calls.When it did work, the sound quality was awful.It does have a beautiful display...big deal.I would strongly urge anyone to stay away from this piece of junk."
3,Bluetooth Problem.,I just bought this phone 3days ago and i have access the three different bluetooth headsets. I hear static on all of them when phone is in my pocket and im on a call useing headset. Anyone else have this problem?
3,Good Media Device,"I purchased the Samsung SYNC to replace a Motorola v551. The SYNC is sleek, has a beautiful display, good camera (except for the lack of autofocus and flash), and an OK mp3 player interface.Unfortunately I am very disappointed in the sound quality under normal phone calls. On even the loudest setting, voices are noticeably muffled. Using a bluetooth headset, I've heard, overcomes this problem, but 75% of the time I'm not using my headset and want to use the phone as a phone.Also, for Mac users, the Sync can connect to your mac to transfer address book entries or photos, but it does not work with iSync at tbis point in time. Therefore you cannot syncronize the calendar on the phone with outside applications, so you would have to re-enter all of your appointments on your phone instead of doing a nice and simple sync."
2,"Phone is fine, aftermarket chargers won't work","I have no real issues with the phone. It's annoying that it is impossible to keep clean, inside & out.It has the MP3 player, which sounds decent. It has a nice looking screen (even though I ALWAYS wipe it off.)But aftermarket chargers won't work. I found out this is a common problem. I don't know what they put in their $30 chargers, but the ones I've tried from ebay (2 wall chargers & 3 car chargers) don't work. I know, I know. I could have purchased the $30 version with all I've spent on aftermarket chargers. But that's just lame."
2,Huge disappointment...,"This phone started out cool when I got it. Was impressed that it took an S/D card, and you could load your own ring tones. But the phone quickly broke down with normal everyday use.Rolling around on the carpet wrestling with the kids smashed the mini outer LCD. Then a few weeks later, I dropped the phone getting out of my car, and that killed the main screen.Now I can't use 90% of the phones features. As a last resort, I bought a A707 USB cable to try to fetch some of my contacts. But apparently the USB cable does not work with the Samsung software under Windows XP. Its totally hosed. Cingular always put up signs in their window that said ""FEWEST DROPPED CALLS"", and I used to think they were just completely full of BS. But now I'm wondering if it was the phone... HMMMM.Caveat Emptor."
3,Samsung phone problems,"Hi all -Got this phone and within four days it kicked into a boot loop that cannot be fixed (even taking out the battery does not stop it). It starts up, kicks into the main screen and none of the buttons work, eventually shuts down and then starts up again ad infinitum until you pull the battery. I got a replacement phone from amazon and this happened AGAIN - this time it only took a day. I don't know what's going on (i did find another online account of this from someone who bought through a cingular store recently), but i'm suspicious that samsung has released a batch of defective phones. So beware - i just cancelled out my plan and am rethinking my cell phone options."
1,"Poor Quality, Bad design, poor reception","1. The phone keeps dropping calls - where my Motorola Razr had no problems.2. I cannot get it to sync reliably with my outlook - suddenly the USB connection will say, ""Device Not Recognized"". All my other USB devices work fine on my PC3. Let's play ""find the camera"" - to get to the camera ready to shoot I have to go through 4 menus - by which time my kids have invariably moved on. So long kodak moment4. Music player won't work with my blue tooth headsetBuying this phone was a big misake."
1,Don't buy this phone. It is bad.,"This phone is bad.It is only two months old. We turn it on and use only 2-3 times a day to make 1-2 minutes calls, and the battery completely discharges every second day. We already replaced one phone because the battery died on very second day, but new phone is the same.Also, almost every time we use this phone it tries to connect to the internet. The internet access button is located right in the middle of all major keys, so it is very difficult not to press it. We use this phone very carefully, but still get about 20 internet data transfers on each monthly bill.To compare, our Motorola RAZR does not have any of these problems. Battery lives for at least two weeks with the phone turned on for 12 hours a day. No accidental access to the internet at all."
2,Ok Phone with Terrible Interface,"Ive owned this phone for well over a year and frankly, am dissappointed. No voice dial and a speakerphone that is basically unusable due to its ridiculously low volume. Outside of that, its slim and has great battery life. Voice quality is ok but it definitely seems that when both parties are talking, it cuts out.Next phone wont be a samsung. The interface is just plain terrible."
1,Very Poor Quality Phone and AT+T Service,BAD phone/Sevice! Renewed my Cingular/AT+T service with 2 of the Samsung SYNC A707 devices with AT+T. Been 45 days and could not be more disappointed! Very Poor quality! been through 2-3 batteries each phone and now one does not get any signal (eventhough bars showing). Spend many hours with AT+T tech - since over 30 days AT+T/Samsung not very helpful at all. I read these reviews everytime I purchase something new -please DO NOT get this phone or AT+T service!
2,"Like AT&T, but not the phone","Purchased this phone in March of 2007, and have already replaced the unit once due to severe lag between menu prompts and continuous dropped calls. Replacement phone displays the same problems of dropping calls more than it should as well as severe lag between menu prompts. This is not so much an AT&T issue as it is a Samsung issue. Overall, phone has nice features marred by poor performance. Not a phone to recommend out of AT&T's selection."
1,It Disconnects,My opinion of Samsung SYNC is:1. Disconnects you on a daily basis.2. Phone had a hard time keeping the right amount of charge time.3. It is a nice looking phone. Had to return it due to the amount of disconnects and it was gotten 09/08/2007. (Returned it 15 days later for full refund.)
1,terrible phone!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the battery on this phone is terrible...evewryday i'm charging it, and the reception is very poor.....i miss my nokia"
3,charging's a problem...,"i liked this phone a lot when i got-- sleek, great camera. yet charging is very backward. first there is this little plastic piece that covers the charging terminal. i am sure it will break off shortly as it is flimsy. second, it is v. difficult to properly place the plug so that charging begins. the first couple of weeks were fine, but now i can't get the plug in the right ""position"" and cannot charge. my crummy previous lg 1500 has a far superior infallible plug. plus, i am a big speakerphone fan. half the time, the speakerphone is inaccessible. bottomline, i'm returning it w/i the 30 day period and shopping for a replacement."
1,fried my drive,"this product fried my drive. i am an experianced IT professional, when I plugged it in to the power source began smoking."
3,works. Lots of cables.,"Works as advertised. I just needed to connect to a drive temporarily(hour or so), and disconnect. I wouldn't want to use it long term. 4 different cables to connect together. Obviously no case for the drive, could see a drive being knocked off the desk or something."
3,Works fine. Wish it had power over usb though.,I thought I would be able to take this with me and use my SATA drives with USB but you also need to take the rather large power adapter. All the external usb enclosures are able to power over USB so why can't this?
2,Great while it worked,"I needed to pull files off of a fried computer onto my new Windows 7 box. This adapter powered up the HD and was recognized right away as a new USB device. I was able to copy over about 100Gb of data with no problem. However, about a half hour later I went to copy more and it no longer worked. I thought maybe it was a Windows 7 issue, but it no longer is seen as a USB device on an XP machine I also connected it to, and didn't work any better on either machine with another drive attached. Maybe it overheated, but at least I got the critical files over."
2,Doesn't really work much,Got it to transfer data from one hard drive to another but in the middle of large data transfers it will randomly disconnect from the computer and then reconnect making the transfer corrupt...It does work if your transferring one single large file (such as a iso or a movie) but if you want to transfer tons of mp3s or text files look somewhere else... Tested on windows 7 x32 and x64 and xp pro
2,Sorry but this item only worked for a week,Sorry but this item only worked for a week it was a nightmare to me to make it work. It was not what i was expecting.
2,"Good descriptions, Bad Zones","I got this book a couple of days ago and the first thing I noticed were the gret pictures and descriptions of thousands of plants. On second inspection I noticed the Zone that many of the plants I grow (in zone 3) are listed as zone 6? who chose the zones? did they just guess. I buy plants from all over and many of the plants listed in this book are great, but I can't tell if they will grow for me when most of the zones listed are wrong."
2,Overpriced,"There are only really 8 half hour episodes. After a while it became overly repetitive: Why is Darkseid always trying to conquer Earth? Don't they have other worthy adversaries?Only two episodes stand out: Fear, which features the origin of Batman (almost like an episode of the celebrated animated series of the nineties), and The Death Of Superman, which at least showed some emotion. The rest is average."
4,Came as advertisted.,This DVD came as advertisted.The DVD set did have all the storylines and the extras that were in the ad.
3,Memories like the colors of my cape,"When I first heard of this compilation, I was excited. MY youth!!! Cyborg!!! Firestorm (two ids in one!!!)!!! Then it arrived. Some cool mid 1980's pre CGI art, neatly handed stories. Yet, some stories fell flat. Overall, it's okay. Don't miss ""the death of Superman"" eight years before the comic intoduced Doomsday. Plus, the Royal Flush Gang and Bizarro stories R pretty good too. Fun!"
5,"Well, I'm the author, so this is like cheating.","Well, I absolutely love this book.I'll confess, I'm very biased.This book has a good deal of me in it, and I like me.Although it starts off a little less smooth during Cow Defender's teenage years (which is fairly appropriate when thought about), it eventually hits its stride and Cow Defender really starts to come into his own."
4,Great DVD,"I found an article in Shape magazine highlighting this DVD, so I bought it in an effort to mix up my workouts. My intentions were to use it on ""off"" days when I didn't go to the gym. It's turned out to be a very good purchase. Her accent is a little difficult to understand at first, but after you get used to it, following her direction becomes quite easy. She's positive and explains each new move while allowing ample practice time before adding them to the routine."
4,This is a great workout and very challenging!,"Ilaria has a great technique which makes it easy to learn the moves. The karate moves are a bit challenging, but after a couple of times, it gets easier."
4,Christmas Present,I bought this for my fiance for part of his christmas present. He loves it! The design is great! Two logos on a baseball
5,Nice replacement,"I twisted my last bit, so this is a nice replacement. It seemes better then the set that I have."
5,Why Can't We Talk,This book is an insperation for teens and thier parents. It shows teens that the problems they are having are normal and they are not alone. It also helps parents to understand thier childs point of view and hopefully will open up the lines of communication. Mikki Trujillo did an excellent job and the book is amazing!
2,Confusing,"I bought this book thinking it was for parents but I got confused as to who this book was for. That isn't such a big deal, I guess but as I read on I didn't find any earth shattering information. It is clear that the author cares and that is good, but I think more research and a clearer title might have helped this book. It is extremely difficult to be a parent of a teenager today. We know all the things that our parents did wrong and we know we don't want to repeat those mistakes. BUT we don't have clear and researched advice on what to replace those old mistaken methods with. This is what I was hoping for. I was dissappointed, although I don't feel it was terrible book, I just didn't get anything from it."
3,SOMETHING DIFFERENT,"I love christmas music, have to start listening to all my music after Thanksgiving to hear them all, was looking something different"
1,Review of Elina Mermaid Halloween costume,"The costume was poorly made - I had to sew it 3 times before my daughter went trick/treating. Then after she got back, I wound up throwing the costume away - it completely shredded along the bottom sides.Not at all worth the money that I paid for it!"
4,Love the game but tin is too bog,i love the colors however i could probably fit twice the amount of dominoes inside the over sized tin. i hate that there is so much room left inside for no apparent reason.
2,OK,"I've read so many books on writing ,it was mostly repetitive. I loved the way it was written though and enjoyed reading it. Probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone but a novice."
2,Easy to Read,"This book gives a simple explanation of what the Bach Flower Essences are and how they can be used. However, I did not get much more information from this book than from a 50 page pamphlet offered for free by the Dr. Edward Bach Centre.There are many opinions about Buddhism and Karma mixed in with the information about the essences. I have no objection to reading about these things, but I feel the strong religious slant of the book should have been mentioned in the book's description."
5,Great resource to learn about flower remedies,"I love this book, and have used it many times to help me prepare remedies for myself and my friends. Each person that I've created a remedy for has told me how much the remedy had helped them feel more emotionally balanced. This book does a great job of explaining the characteristics of the different essences, making it easy to choose the appropriate remedies. You won't regret trying Bach Flower remedies--they're easy to use and amazingly effective ."
5,Made HTML Seem Easy!,"I was tasked with taking over my company web site and redesigning our web pages. I was up for the challenge, but I had no skills with HTML. On the recomendation of a co-worker who has used several IconLogic books, I purchased the ""Essentials of Web Page Development.""I was not disappointed. The book is written in a tutorial format and was very complete and easy to follow. Lessons were offered on tables, frames, style sheets, image maps, links, colors... everything I needed to create web pages.I highlighly recommend this helpful book."
4,The true history of Native Americans,"In this book, Eguiguren reveals the true history of of Native Americans. This is the stuff that they don't teach you in school! He covers the past, from the first 'treaty' in 1778, up into our modern times. Completely unreservedly, Eguiguren exposes the U.S. Federal Government's policy of Indian affairs, and shows just how corrupt Uncle Sam actually is when it comes to dealing with the Native Americans. This book will open your eyes, and I do highly recommend it to anyone!"
3,It's okay,We love Victor Borge and these are fun for the money. They are all black and white. I must say this collection is not half as funny as his later comedies...but still worth the cost I think.
2,bad sound,It's very hard to hear what is being said. The film is just too old to reproduce properly.
1,Victor Borge Show,I would not have ordered had I known it was merely a collection of dated black & white video clips from early TV.It even includes the original ads for Kellogs cereal!In fact there is more footage of Kellogs than of Borge.Someone put this together on the cheap & markets it to the unsuspecting public.It isn't worth a dime as entertainment. It belongs nowhere but in a TV museum
5,Perfect,"This handle fit and works perfectly. I used it many, many times and it is a great accessory. Not much else to say. I'd recommend it."
4,"My father, my childhood, my legacy","My father, Howard Warren Lewis, wrote this book when I was in high school, 1964 - 1968. It was published in 1969. The book follows the adventures of our family from the time I was only a small child in the middle 1950's, as my parents raised my brother and I to be accomplished mountaineers. With very little fictionalization, it details trips into the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains of the American west and Canada. Through harrowing episodes that would make modern parents cringe we back-packed, rock climbed and ascended prodigious peaks that still had Sierra Club summit registers signed by the likes of John Muir. An incredible legacy for me and my brother Greg Lewis, we delight in the sweet phrasing and adventurous spirit of our father's writing. An enjoyable true story."
5,Awesome Marinade,All these marinades are awesome. I put 1 packet of the seasoning and cure with some water in a bag with about 1.5 lbs of meat and let it set for a day in the fridge. The meat tastes so good afterwards. Just perfect all the time. Not too much or too little. 1.5 lbs of meat seems to be the perfect balance. You bite off a piece and as you chew the flavor comes out perfectly and is oh so good!!!Def Recommended!
1,This stuff tastes terrible,"I bought this stuff with my Dehydrator to test the waters of what homemade beef jerky tastes like, but this stuff is terrible. It tastes like pure chemicals, like they used only liquid smoke and preservatives. The first time I marinaded it for about 16 hours and I thought that might have been too long, so I did 4 hours the next batch and it was just as bad. Don't waste perfectly good meat, just use terriyaki if your feeling lazy, I bought a bottle at the store and that batch was way better."
3,Good stuff..3.5 stars....but I think it was on the shelf a while....,No complaints...good seasoning...I used the same batch several times with good results...the material was hardened in a couple of packs...which didn't defer from the quality....I make my own marinade...and the original and Teriyake were OK..the spicy was VERY VERY good which I can't duplicate...forget the variety pack...if you like a kick go for the spicy which is really awesome...
4,Nice and Spicy,"We've tried a few spice recipies for making jerky, but this is the easiest and best yet. The directions seem a bit unclear if you are making jerky from sliced meat, but we follow the directions for ground meat, adding enough liquid to moisten all the meat before marinating in a bag for 6 hours or more.By mixing original and spicy flavors, we get jerky that is not too hot, not too bland, and not too salty (which has been a problem with some recipies). We think it's good, and our friends all ask for more."
5,A touching story of one girl's look beyond appearances.,An inspiring story of how the human spirit comes alive when Sarah Jane looks beyond the mysterious green door of an elderly neighbor to discover the beauty within.
4,Go cat go!,"Album incl. hits: ""Runaway Boys"", ""Stray Cat Strut"", ""Rumble in Brighton"". ""Fishnet Stockings"" are absolutely inspired by ""Bop Bop Ba Doo Bop"" (Lew Williams classic), ""Crawl Up And Die"" is inspired by Please Give Me Something (originaly Bill Allen), ""Double Talkin Baby (Gene Vincent's original), ""Jeanie Jeanie, Jeanie"" (Eddie Cochran), ""Ubangi Stomp"" (Warren Smith's), ""My One Desire"" (written by Dorsey Burnette for Ricky Nelson), ""Wild Saxaphone"" is Montrell Roy's (originaly named ""(Every Time I Hear) That Mellow Saxophone""), and ""Storm The Embassy"" is a New Wave song. Produced by Dave Edmunds. Good rockin' album!"
2,Not the same...,This isn't the same group I saw on TV some time ago.It's like they are playing just slightly out of sync.It's a shame. I really liked the originals.These - not so much...
1,Buyer beware!,"I just got off the phone with Audiovox customer service who say that this product has never been able to play anything more than an Ipod-- never had an RCA input jack, never had USB connection capability, and never had a memory card reader. If, as I did, you buy this product for any of its non-Ipod features, you will end up returning it. Someone from Amazon should read this and change the description!"
1,Audiovox CE609CR - Not worth the money even if it is inexpensive,This product showed promise but within a few short week the sound button broke off. I tried to fix it but the little plastic wheel was snapped in pieces. Also had another friend who had the exact same problem. I would not recommend this
2,confusing,I have already purchased Arabic on CD-ROM by Eurotalk. These versions differ markedly. There should be more info about product on the label and also provided by the manufacterer on the Amazon-page - otherwise buyers will be purchasing apples and orqnges.
3,Easy to use but a bit costly,"Cost is a bit high for what the product contains, but the pump is nice for easy mixing with food, especially if your furry loved one is not to good about taking the gel tabs.If you don't start seeing results after the first bottle, try switching brands...different brands contain different ratios of Omega6 and Omega 3. The trick is finding the product with the ratio that works best for your dog."
2,Not really sure about this one,I was recommended this item from our vet. She did mention it would take atleast 6 weeks before you could tell a difference.I have not noticed too much change with our dogs coat and skin itching problem. It is winter right now though and our biggest problem seems to be the summer time. Maybe I will see a better result during that time.
3,Not an easy red in some ways,"Only three stars because I've only read abut 60% of the book!I come ""not to bury nor to praise"" this book but to warn folks that it's not as accessible as some of his other works.(I've read Lempriere's dictionary and The Pope's Rhino)..I had some trouble focussing and integrating the threads of the story, but will have another go sometime."
5,Terrific,"This was my home town growing up. City Island is a very unusual and ideal place to grow up and live. Very close knit community, home town feel in New York. Really enjoyed the detailed history that this book provided and it filled in alot of information that I, an Islander, did not even know! Highly recommend this book."
4,"Rockford Fan (Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","This is a great book. If you are a Rockford Files fan, this book is a must buy. The author (Ed Robertson) has gone to great lengths to even include the phone messages at the begining of each and every episode."
3,"Good reference, a little pricey","It's a nice addition to the TV library, and there is a good deal of information in it, but I was a little disappointed for the value received for price paid.I paid a similar amount for a complete compendium of 'Mission:Impossible', and it provided much greater episodic depth (this book only lightly deals with individual episodes).When I was done with it, I knew Garner and the show a LITTLE better, but it really could have had a lot more depth.If you are a strong Rockford enthusiast, it's probably required reading and a nice addition to your collection....but try to buy it used somewhere. It' really not worth thirty bucks."
4,Great resource guide,"I enjoyed reading about one of my favorite, ""classic"" TV series. I have been diligently purchasing the DVD's as they are released and found the book to be a great behind-the-scenes episode guide. I found the background information about the series as a whole to be interesting as well."
3,If you're Rockford File fan read it.,"This is a good book, but like all genre of show books it's only average as far as interest and enjoyment. I loved the Rockford Files and still watch them when on one of the cable channels. I've seen some of the episodes at least 5-6 times. There are a few bummers among them (mostly the last two years), but 75% of them I enjoyed. After four years or so I think any writing staff is challenged to write fresh & creative material for a show and I don't think Rockford Files was an exception to the rule.The books tells quite a bit about the actors & actoresses who played in the show. It also talks about the Pontiac Firebird that Jim drove. If your a James Garner/Rockford fan do read the book."
5,"No soul, you won't like this....","Cost of Loving got a bad rap. A bad rap song too. No matter, no one in the eighties seemed to have a sence of humour, or a sence of grace like TSC did. I've always felt good listening to their records. Although this is not their best effort, I had to write in defence of the review you first see. This journalist obviously does the whiteman's overbite and has to be dragged out onto a dance floor DRUNK to have a good time! The ninties could have you used a challenging band like TSC...make you question yer suroundings and yer heart....that's what they do and did for me.Lou"
2,ok mix,"Nothing special, starts quite good, although I didnt like that breakdown style, some pieces fitting good together, most dont. The last two pieces are too long and have no relation with the rest. If you like a good funk - soul-mix check out DJ Miles'""Funky Sole"" or ""Kings of diggin"" the Mix by DJ Muro - highly recommended."
4,A stellar polar year,"In the course of a few pages, this nonfiction picture book takes us through a year of activity in the Artic. We start in the barren unknowns of the Artic winter, where an artic fox looks at a distant moon, norther lights flicker, and the polar caps begin to melt. When Arctic summer comes, so do birds, plants, polar bears, seals, and whales. Then birds migrate, bears prepare to migrate -- winter has come comes once more.The illustations by Margaret Chodos-Irvine are full, tender, and haunting. The words, while teaching a lot about Arctic ecology, are very simple, with a good deal of repetition. This is a lovely book. However, because of its simplicity, instead of the suggested 3-7 age range, I think it is more appropriate for 2-4 year old animal lovers."
4,ten short stories by Mishima Yukio,"Ten stories by Mishima Yukio; three of which are translated by Edward Seidensticker, two by Ivan Morris, three by Donald Keene, and two by Geoffrey Sargent.Personally, I don't care for Seidensticker's style -- his translations always seem so lifeless -- and reading through his three stories [including the ""Death in Midsummer"" of the title] was nearly torturous. My favorites of this set of short stories were ""The Seven Bridges"" [Keene, trans.] and ""Patriotism"" [Sargent, trans.], a look at the last days of a soldier and his wife.Mishima's stories often lack a traditional plot, focusing instead upon the slow development of a single scene, or on emerging human emotions and motives. Death is a recurring theme in all of his work, and is portrayed with a terrible beauty and admiration.Recommended."
4,Not my chosen car but this guy has the goods.,A lot of this was pretty confusing too understand but he wrote one really great story dealing with Buddhism.He definitely has a gift for details and dialouge.
2,not the best choice,"I gave this to my fiance for Christmas, who loves Sudoku and video games, so I thought it would be a brilliant combination. He was excited, but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play. He can't always tell where the cursor is on the board, so if he sets it down for a minute, he can't see where's he's left off. Then when he was playing in the semi-dark while we were on a train, he couldn't see anything either (backlight would be a nice feature). It just seems this model is not designed very intuitively: he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number, but it clears the game. all that to say, 2 million puzzles sounds great...unless it's too frustrating to play!"
1,Not Good,"This particular Sudoku handheld was not as expected. It has only basic functions and the person I purchased for said it is easier just to do Sudoku on line or in the newspaper or in a puzzle book. Really inconvenient functions. May be good for young children, but not adults."
2,needs to evole,"when i first heard this album i was boncing off the walls in indescribable ectasy, the sheer adrealine intoxacated me....now that i've onwed this for over three months, im already consetering selling it. im not in anyway saying this cd is not fast, brutal or terrifing, but thats exactly all it is. it's fun for the frist five plays, but the same rapid fire drumming, muted chords, and gory lyrics and imagry get boring very quickly. the atepts at solos are pathatic as well. for the life of me, i can't understand why a band such has cannible corpse whom have been around for over a deacade have changed so little. they would be much more exiting and intesting to listen to if they simply expairmrented with there sound somewhat. however, it's pointles to go on compaling about there sound, seeing as this mediocricy has earned them cult status. canible corpse zelots, discard this, you know your tastes."
3,Don't Believe The Hype,"I have to disagree with my fellow reviewers. This album is somewhat generic, and nowhere near being their second best album. (You guys actually think this is better than Tomb of the Mutilated or Gallery of Suicide?!) A decent release from Corpse, but a far cry from their past glories. If you're new to Corpse, I recommend starting with Butchered at Birth or Tomb of the Mutilated."
3,gore obsessed- pretty good- better than bloodthirst,"well i was little weiry of getting this cd, only because cc is sounds the same just about every cd they put out. at least in the past 8 years. some cool stuff on this, sounds alot like gallery of suicide. paul really needs to be more exciting on the drums though. he should listen to SOILS OF FATE and take lessons. soils is very brutal. very sick!! anyway if your a cc fan than buy it,i did."
1,Just plain BLOWS!,"I'm as big of fan as any other Cannibal Corpse fan but this disc blows. The guitars are muddy and all over the place. The guitar work is too technical with no rhythm. I see most people reviewed this as a great release; I just don't see it. I almost fell asleep listening to it; it's that boring! I'm a huge death metal fan and I see Cannibal every time they tour but their older stuff is much, much better. Watching Pat play guitar is wicked...His style is the best I've seen. Jack, on the other hand, looks like he doesn't have a pulse. George needs to lay off the cookies. I would avoid this release. My copy is going on ebay."
1,PURE TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you like this kind of music, then go see a head doctor, cuz you need to go"
1,old,things that are older than dirt decribe this album. This has to be one of the worse albums ever done but lets not forget they have yet to release a bilboard classic but i guess that does not matter if you have stunk since 1993 things just seem to get easier to screw up for instence every song on this album.
1,Another classic,"Went to the local record store last Wednesday. Looked under the Mariah Carey section. Found this in its place. Put it in my CD player. I have never heard such disgusting, disgraceful, despicable garbage in my whole life. Once you have been exposed to this kind of filth, you have been contaminated for life. I may never be the same again."
3,its all right,"this cd really isnt as brutal as cannibal can be, but theyre are a lot of solos and some very catchy songs like ""when death relaces life"" and ""mutation of the cadaver"""
5,INCREDIBLE,"I bought CC's ""VILE"" on cassette tape a year or two ago, and still listen to it over and over in my car to this day. I just picked up my second CC album, ""GORE OBSESSED"", on CD today. It had a black cardboard slipcase covering up the front artwork, for good reason. If any little kid saw this album sitting on the shelf, it would scar his mind. Whoever does the artwork for this band is extremely talented. Musically, this album is INCREDIBLE and JAW DROPPING. The riffs, basslines, drums, and lyrics stick in my head. They are brutal, in-your-face, and memorable. All of the members in this band are extremely talented. I can't wait for their next CD. I heared it's going to be called ""Kill""."
5,"TERRIFIC BOOK, UNIQUE IDEAS THAT WORK!","This book is a must for anyone who lives in a small space and is searching for ways to make it more efficient and attractive. These ideas work well and not all of them cost a fortune to implement. My personal favourite was the tree house - it brings out the inner child in each of us no matter what biological age we may be. Not that everyone would want a tree house, but the idea was purely unique and creative.This book has beautiful coloured photography and is ideally suited to apartment dwellers or those working in a small office space that is in need of a make-over. The author has put together a book which displays talent, creativity, and an expert eye for design and colour. ""Small Spaces"" is highly recommended and deserving of a five-star rating."
4,A wealth of ideas,"This book is jam-packed with creative ideas for small spaces. However, I felt the majority of the designs were ultra-modern and had a sterile feeling. (It could be that my personal taste runs in a different direction than the author's!) Having said that, I really appreciated the floor plans and interesting case studies, and I'm sure I'll be referring to this book again and again."
3,I expected more creativity,Banal works. This book is not what I was expecting. Poor creativity to deal with small spaces. Don't spend money with this book.
3,Misleading title,The title of this book WAS misleading. Samantha is not a bride and she never shows up in a wedding dress like on the cover. Just because Will might be looking for a bride doesn't make Samantha one during this book. I picked it up thinking it was a wedding story and it wasn't. It was a little confusing but didn't affect how I felt about the story. The beginning of this book was good. The rest wasn't as good. I started out liking Sam a lot. She was really strong and courageous. As the story went on it ended up being too much about Will saving her over and over. She was the professional not him so it was disappointing to see a book where the man still had to save the woman. The mystery was good. I do wish Sam was kept as strong in the end as she was in the beginning.
3,Its ok but little miss leading,"The silicone fits psp 3000 perfectly. Although, all buttons are covered(unlike the picture). The umd slot is also covered(unlike the picture): Which that is what I was hoping for anyways. When the case is on the psp, you have to hold the umd slot open to change game because it wont stay open(due to silicone pushing it close). Also, it was suppose to come with a screen protector. It did but it must be for psp 1000 because it was wayyyyy to small. I was looking forward to the screen protector so I was disapointed about that."
2,Not enough color and content,"Much of Celtic art is very colorful, yet I found the examples in this book to often have only 3-5 real color variations. Most of the designs concentrated on crosses and swirls, and of the 75 designs listed, most of them are just small repeatable motifs. I was hoping for some actual Celtic Art reproductions pieces and a lot more big complete projects to do, rather than just ornamental designs. I was so disappointed with this book, knowing that I would never stitch anything from it, that I returned it.The book does offer a brief history of Celtic art and each different type of design has an introduction explaining it's history. I did find this quite interesting.Since tastes in stitching projects are so wide, this book may have exactly what you're looking for. I would just suggest you try to get a look at it first to be sure before ordering site unseen."
4,Delighted,Just what I was looking for. I particularly liked the the design snippets at the back and there were plenty of them.
5,Unique designs,This book was exactly what I was looking for. All patterns are in colour and easy to follow. The unique designs are well interpreted. I use this book for beading and not cross stitch- the patterns work well.
4,One good book to get ready for the final show,"This is one of the very good books that came to be very useful in my final preparations. If you have spent enought time to study the subject matter, this book will be an outstanding help for you.. But if you think to start with this book, this may not be that useful ..I have liked the way the auhors organized the book.. My sincere gratitude to them....."
5,without due process,I was a very good book to get into. I could not put it down and carried it with me everywhere I went and that means in the house. IT WAS GREAT. Thank you. And the large print is great.
4,"Nice, quality case","Nice case that fits my Epi Thunderbird perfectly. Big compartment inside for cords, books, etc.FYI, my case had the full Epiphone name written on it and not just the ""E"" Logo. It also included 4 small chrome legs on the flat side opposite the logo to protect the case when you lay it down, very cool."
3,Heavy but pretty,Got this for my 14 yr old. Thunderbird bass fits well but once in the case it is very heavy. Beautiful inside with inside compartments. Ended up finding a gig bag that will fit the thunderbird. This one is now collecting dust. Just too heavy...
4,Only case that will fit this bass - decent for the price,This is a decent quality case and the only case that will really fit this bass. There are others out there that say they will fit a Gibson Thunderbird but the Epi version is slightly different so go with this - plus it's way less expensive.
5,Holds my Bass,Perfect for the T-bird. Great quality. Holds and protects Bass. Would also work with other fish of similar shape and size.
2,Don't get it unless you have to...,"I can't stand these workbooks; answering any of the questions requires lengthy copying of passages from the textbook itself. If it's not required for a class, I wouldn't bother, as this is not a ""study guide"" but simply a workbook."
3,This is not 2 Guage,"It says 2 guage but the package i recieved definitely was not a 2 Guage. On the wires themselves they say 2 Guage but it's at best a 4 gauge. Don't get me wrong, I think its a good deal still especially with the free shipping. If you need to wire more then one amp then this isn't what you want."
3,Power cable is only 17'....not 20' as listed,"The product description says that the power cable is 20' long. I opened the kit and noticed that the power cable couldn't reach my trunk. Then I read the front of the kit, and I found out that the power cable is only 17' long. 17' of power cable should be long enough for most cars, but if you drive an SUV or a long car (like my linc. towncar), you'll most likely come up short."
1,Misleading,"As everyone has been stating, the cabling is definitely not 2 gauge... i have a xxx brand 4 gauge amp kit in my car already, and got this one to add in so i can wire a 4 channel amp.... that 4 gauge wire is thicker then this supposed 2 gauge wire..."
2,dont buy if you need real power,"This kit is definately not 2 gauge wire, im in school to be an electrican so i know my wire,its no bigger than 8 gauge wire with a very thick insulation jacket, i bought this tp ower my 1600 watt phoenix gold amp and 2 12 inch phoenix gold rsdc,definately will be ordering a new kit, save yourself the trouble and spend a few more bucs and get a kit that has the size cable that it says it has."
2,I wouldn't trust this,"Okay, as I am sure you read in the other reviews this is DEFINITELY not a 2 gauge. I'd give it like a 5 or 6 gauge. Honestly, it is fine if your hooking anything up under 1000 watts. Honestly, if the company lied about the gauge of the wire they could be using cheapo metal alloys in the wire and stuff. I wouldn't trust them, and I kind of regret buying it, I am only using it for the Fuse and terminators and stuff. DON'T BUY!!!"
3,Ya get what ya pay for (mislabeled as 2-Gauge),"The Power Acoustic 2-gauge wire looked an awful lot like what I grew up calling 8-gauge. Maybe somewhere between 4- and 8-. Oh well. You get what you pay for and I expected as much from the other reviews. The other wires and hardware in the package were perfectly adequate and did the trick for my install. Not the highest quality, but pretty fair for the price. I just wish they would give a more accurate statement of what to expect so that potential customers don't have to rely on reviewers to get snapped back to the reality that this isn't the great deal it might appear to be.Here's an idea: All the product descriptions from wire and cable manufacturers should include a precise measurement of the average diameter of the metal in a cross-section of the wire, e.g. 2.475 millimeters.Wouldn't that be great?"
3,good value purchase,"this was my first purchas for wiring. it was a very cheep package that came with everything needed. my only complaint is the interconnects provided are not of high quality. they produced awfull scratching noises caused from the oddest things, like turning on the air conditioning on high or turning the fog lights on and off. my recomendation is that if you buy this kit, that you replace the interconnects with some Monster interconnects. after switching to monster my system performed perfect."
4,Several editions available,"Sold out? Prajnaparamita in Tibetan Buddhism by E.Obermiller, Edited by Harcharan Singh Sobti M.A.,Phd. by Paljor Publications, is an exact copy of the 1988 Pilgrims version with ISBN 81-85132-05-04 who might still be available."
4,Excellent value in a pocket-size package.,"A value-packed book with a strong emphasis on overcoming stage fright. Detailed description of how to write a quick speech, keep note cards, what to wear, how to use visuals, and how to deal with hostile audiences, among others. Provides most of the good solid speaking tips and presentation skills found in larger and much more expensive books. A good book to bend the pages and mark up useful passages with highlighter. Definitely worth the price in paperback."
2,"Not for practioners, but great for students","I must say that I was quite dissapointed with the book. The book was stale and at times too disciptive. Perhaps, it was meant for students and not real world practictioners. However, to be fair, I am quite sure that both the authors are experts on the subject and would be great if they had written a more applicable / practical follow-up for us in the (service) game. Like I said, this would be a good text and that's about it."
5,"Fabulous tool for parents, grandparents, and for teaching child development to all levels of students!","My profession is in Child Development, particularly autism, and I have been searching for many years for an effective teaching tool for parents and students that is enjoyable and informative at the same time. I have even tried rather unsuccessfully to video typically developing infants and children myself to use as tools. Nothing can even remotely compare with this series of documentaries: ""To Walk"", ""To Talk"" and ""To Think"". I cannot wait for the release of The Baby Human II which includes ""To Relate"" and ""To Belong"".Not only a great teaching tool, but a WONDERFUL baby shower gift!Pauline A. Filipek MDUC Irvine School of MedicineDirector, For O.C. Kids"
3,Ok but not great,"We purchased this video thinking that it would offer some tips on what we as parents can do to help our child develop. Rather, the video is a documentary on three/four aspects of child developement but not offing tips per say. I would say this video is more like the next step for the In The Womb series (by National Geographic) rather than an instructional video. All in all it was interesting but not what we were looking for."
4,Worth the investment,"It is, just as the second part, a pretty good tool for everyone who's interested in human development, specially children's and babies'. I only believe it'd be a great help if it also had subtitles for the hearing impaired or other languages, but it's a real jewel to have."
4,Amazing!,"Too many things to believe, if there was only more detailed info rather than just taking there word for it."
2,Book,"It had a lot of interesting ideas and info, but with out much actual evidence it wasnt that great a read. There was really no detal to any of the items brought up."
2,Not a story,This is not a novel although it starts as one. It quickly desolves into chapter after chapter - some 30 chapters - of example after example. I understand the point the writer was trying to make but this is not a story. It's not even a book. It's an argument.
1,gives no info,"for a book on discoveries, it gives almost no information on them. it simply lists supposed discoveries. exactly where, exactly when, and by whom? who knows? this book doesn't tell you. it's a real disappointment."
3,Interesting -- but skims the surface,"Interesting -- but skims the surfaceThis book is mostly brief references to historical anomalies and odd findings of past civilizations. The actual references for the sources of the book are lacking detail, which takes away credibility.The majority of the book is complied as a few paragraphs at the beginning of a chapter followed by a list of items which are suppose to back up the authors contention that a civilization much greater in technology than our own once inhabited the Earth.Time might better be spent reading ""Ancient Man: A Handbook of Puzzling Artifacts"" by Wm. Corliss or ""The Hidden History of the Human Race"" by Cremo and Thompson.Overall entertaining if you are looking for light reading on the topic of historical anomalies."
2,Intriguing premise but requires of leap of logic & faith,Interesting premise w/ some tantalizing evidence but sorely lacking serious scholarship -even for one such as myself who has a propensity to buy the whole thing I was disappointed by leaps of logic and dismayed by lacking substantiation of conclusions. I would love to see a serious scholar `a la the late Barbara Tuchman take on this subject and give it the treatment it deserves.
4,Dead Men's Secret's,This book is the most complete book I've read so far on out of place artifacts. I gave it 4 stars due to a few spelling errors but it covers the so called out of place artifacts the world over. However if you have an evolutionary world view this book will probably give you nightmares.
4,great for the collection,"heard about this book on a radio talkshow one day and had to have it, really good start but then just starts listing items found around the world, wish there was more of a story to it throughout. but over all great read and edifying"
3,PCITURES POOR,SHOULD HAVE CHECKED TO SEE IF THIS WAS A HARD BACK BOOK WITH GOOD PHOTOS. THE INFORMATION WAS GOOD AND INTERESTING.
5,Interesting and thoughtful,An interesting book that takes a more careful look at some of the neglected aspects of the history of humankind.
5,The most fascinating book I have ever read.,"This book reshaped everything I believed about ancient history, it is guaranteed to blow your mind even if you don't believe all of it. I can almost guarantee you wont believe what you're reading at first, but when the book is over you realize that we could have it all wrong after all. In a very distant past some civilizations could very well have been more advanced than us. What is most amazing is how he backs up every claim. Whether you think its nonsense or the most ground breaking understanding of history you have ever seen, it is a fantastic book and I think more people should read it."
2,Mr. Gasket air filter,"I have a t bucket with dual carbs. The carbs and air cleaners are in plain sight so I wanted knew ""white"" filters for the season. Local store only could get one. I ordered another from amazon and it was the correct number and size, however, it was in an older and dusty box. The filter element was different in appearance and yellowish. I couldn't use it!"
5,An ecstatic and agonizing love story!,"In this incredible piece of prosaic poetry, Smart tells the story of the greatest love affair of her life. This book literally rips you from the passionate highs of ecstatic love to the agonizing lows of a love that has ended. Born into the high society, this is Smart's account of her great love for the poet George Barker, and told as powerfully as any love story that I have ever read"
5,Despite the claims of the camera work...,"I personally found no problem with the filming! Very enjoyable and a great joy to see Sarah back doing what she was born to do...entertain! This is a fabulous concert. I feel like I was on stage with her. The real special part was the encore when Sarah came out with her guitarist for an acoustic version of The Beatles ""Blackbird"". Fireworks appear for her to see (and you) but apparently the audience can't! Now those are good seats! Sarah is majestic, beautiful and then she can rock like the best of them! Thank you Sarah!"
3,It's great if you're not looking,"The CD sounds great. As always, Sarah is at her best live & emits an energy through music that is electric.The DVD contains a backstage interview, lyrics, photos, Afterglow's music videos, & of course the concert.The interview & music videos are fabulous, but the concert isn't edited very well.While Sarah is singing the camera views are all over the place.Over the course of 20 seconds the camera quickly flashes to Sarah's eyes, the audience, her band, a distant view of the stage from the back of the arena, Sarah's hands,& the back of her head.I don't regret buying the DVD/CD, though. I was disappointed that the editing wasn't as advanced as the other Sarah concerts, but satisfied that the sound quaility was better than I expected. Mirrorball is great if you don't like it loud, unlike Afterglow.If you're a Sarah fan Afterglow Live is a great addition to the collection.If you just want to hear Sarah's live material, I recommend Mirrorball."
5,Afterglow Live,"Amazing DVD, the sound is perfect! So much better than Mirrorbal. Sarah is a great artist. This one's a MUST.- Patrick."
5,"great CD/DVD, especially for us fans who are not concert freaks","It's a great enjoyment watching Sarah performance on-stage, wish I had been there. Her band is great as always. The way she re-mixed her songs just makes you feel like you are listening to her songs for the very first time.The only complain I have is that it doesn't have two of Sarah's MUST-HAVE songs:Elsewhere, Full of Grace and Time. otherwise you could buy this CD as a gift to someone who haven't been in touch of Sarah's songs."
1,will not buy this do to copywrite protection,"I don't know whats up with this copywrite protection garbage, I would love to own this, but I cannot afford to ruin my computer. good luck all."
5,How Can I Not...,"How can I not mourn all of my lifes problems to this sweet and original vibe of an album, wonderful..Dark and light collides in this, the Goddesses album. The best songs, ""Posse (-I am! -)-ssion"",""Hold On""(..original..) and ""Perfect Girl.."" among others..You really must see and hear the (buy her cookbook..) eloquent and gallant Sarah sing and play and speak, this is the best (also buy ""Living In Clip"" by Ani DiFranco..And Sarah's ""Possession"" on ""Fumbling Towards Ecstacy.."" And the Indigo Girls first, third,.. and second cd's..And Sarolta G. DeFaltay's contribution in the book ""Spiritual Bathing"" by Nadine Epstein and Rosa A...)Live album..Love Sarah Vanes"
4,Sara's Back......,"This was a great addition to my ever growing DVD Concert Library.Being a Canadian, it is always good to see Canadian artists go out there and deliver the goods.I enjoyed most of the songs played, but had a hard time keeping track visually with the camera man who couldn't stay on one shot very long. Maybe a little less coffee next time. All in all it was good show.The additional CD is also a nice way to package a product Look forward to the next one."
4,great,"I wanted to give it 5 stars, but couldn't.The audio and picture quality are great.I think it was a very good idea to include both a cd and dvd together for an affordable price.The performance is very very good.Definitely put this in your must buy list.The only part I don't like is how much the camera angles switch around. Watching it on a smaller TV is fine, but when you try and watch it on a large screen projection it makes it much harder to watch. This isn't the only music video that is like this. Seems like a trend to be constantly switching angles."
1,Thanks for the warning!,"I must admit I haven't seen or heard this item. I just want to thank everyone who posted warnings about the absurd content protection software, and the lousy video editing. If not for those things, I would probably buy this in a heartbeat and really like it. It's sad that Sarah's wonderful works is being botched so badly by greediness and incompetence!"
5,LOVED IT,"love it! and the DVD is great too. She has such a beautiful voice. My favorite is ""The Answer"". Great!"
1,Avoid! This CD is crippled,It's got DRM (Digital Right Management) attached that won't let you put it on your iPod. Funny how Digital Rights Management only protects the record company and strips consumers of their rights.
2,Bland Sound & Editing,"I was pretty excited to get this DVD. Thought it would be great. Well, Sarah is great...but the producing, editing & sound mix are pretty bland. Now, I am known as an expert in sound - so I am definitely biased. But the video leaves a lot to be desired too. Pretty boring.Tom Lord Alge is known as a great mixer (when you get a huge credit on the outside of the DVD box, you are big...) but I feel he 'pushed' the 5.1 mix from a stereo mix. Pretty lazy Tom. I am definitely disappointed. Stereo mix is OK but lacks any dynamics.Overall I felt the only reason it is a 2 is because of the talent of the artist. Sorry."
3,Afterglow DVD doesn't glow,"First, the CD is outstanding! Anytime you can catch Sarah live is worth it. I bought this the day it was released and love the CD...give it 5 stars!On the other hand, the DVD leaves much to be desired from a camera angle point of view. I found it very difficult to watch as the camera jumps around continuosly and doesn't stay on musicians long enough to appreciate what they are doing. If you think you're going to watch something similar to Mirrorball, think twice. I only speak of the camera work...Sarah's performance is 5 stars, as always. She should have used a better director and editor,though"
4,"Great DVD, excellent audio, fair to poor video","The set and the lighting was incredible, enchanting. The music amazing...her voice is flawless, she never hits a raw note!The default setting is 2 channels, but when you change it to 5.1....WOW...what a difference!!!I recommend this DVD highly, however I must warn of the film quality. It looks somewhat grainy....otherwise, it's a great buy. It should have been filmed in Hi-Def. My advice is buy it for the audio, the experience, the performer...the rest is second-place."
5,Afterglow beats Mirrorball,"I get more than i paid for , im deligthted with Sarah s voice, beautifull presence, and such quantity of lovely and extraordinary music (140 mins), blackbird is included also in DVD , however i was a little dissaponted here , because i always get the picture on my mind with Sarah playing her guitar and singing this song but in DVD i saw that one of her musicians plays while she sing, but no problem it sounds amazing anyway , backstage interview is an incredible bonus with some personnal aspects of Sarahs life , and 3 extra videoclips are awesome in particular ""world on fire"" very original concept and call for world conscience that everybody should take note, cd live is onother bonus awesome the same as concert DVD, delicious combo for Sarahs lover like meHM"
2,NO!,"CD/DVD set is great!But the big problem is CD has copy controlled!!!!Stop making this kind of copy protected CD, BMG/SONY!It really hurt our hearts when we pay for the artists!"
4,Just the right size.,I purchased this table because it is a smaller table than most dining tables. An umbrella fits in the post and the heavy base acts as an umbrella holder. It is a perfect fit for my narrow patio. The umbrella hole is a little larger than it needs to be.
1,Not helpful,I bought this booking looking for some tools that I could use to help my son with making friends. The bottom line of the book seems to be that the parents are modeling bad behaviour or your kid isn't really having problems. The book was not helpful.
3,disappointing,"I am a fan of this series and will continue to be.But this story lacked tightness. It was spread too thin with too much going on. Not enough tension. The plot seemed tired, as if she threw in characters just to fill the space.But I still can't wait for the next one. I am sure the next one will be better."
2,I though the Keys were supposed to be enjoyable,"We have all heard ""If I only had a nickel for every ...."". In this book, I wish I had a nickel for every adjective I read. The thin plot of this book was mired down in the weeds of needless prose. To further drag this book down was a bunch of uninteresting characters. I couldn't have cared less for any of them.This was my first, and last, Barbara Parker book."
4,a good read,"This was a good story. I could not imagine the finish of the book and that is good. The plot and story was ineresting. I would happily read other books by this author.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,A good description of toleration,"This book's strength lies in its many examples and systematic structure. The topic is engaging, and it will keep you reading. The fact that it was begotten out of a lecture series helps to keep it brief and not overly wordy. Worth the read if you are interested in the relationship between different groups."
5,Lucky to stumble apon it. BG albums too rare in SA,"This album creates such a powerful atmosphere without trying to be 'mean'. Brilliant lyrics combined with fast, mellodic guitars. I just wish it was possible to get hold of the other albums in this country."
3,Power Metal Stalwarts From Germany,"Blind Guardian are a much-loved band in power metal circles. Anyone who had the guts to play this sort of metal since the beginning of the 90's and has not wavered deserves my respect.To be truthful, I own only the 3 domestically available BG albums, this one being the next-to-last in their oeuvre. The best thing about BG is their tremendous vocalist and the vocal arrangements, bombastically operatic in nature. When they work, they send shivers down my spine. My main criticism about their approach is the busy nature of their drumming. Instead of subtlety, the approach is to go as fast as possible, so it is nice when they relax a bit and throw a ballad here and there. ""Bright Eyes"" is one of my favorites, especially the beginning. A few other songs are as good, but most are mediocre in my opinion."
5,Minstrel Metal,"I had only heard clips before buying this album....this is second only to ""Nightfall In Middle Earth"" which came out shortly after. These guys have been a mainstay in the thrash/speed metal genre for many years now. They have truly risen the bar with acoustic/orchestral arrangements along with operatic vocal harmonies that compliment the higher energy sections (piercing melodic dual guitar harmonies and strumming patterns) which inspire the listener to envision adventures in times long past, and fierce devotion to something other than themselves. Anyone who is into speed/thrash metal should own this album along with nightfall. According to its genre, this is a five star album for sure."
3,Not Blind Guardian's finest,"This album starts off headed in the right direction with the magnificent title-track, but from there it seems to fall a little flat. The overall song-writing just doesn't seem to compare to the stuff on the other two albums I have from them (_Nightfall in Middle Earth_ and _Somewhere Far Beyond_). Hansi's vocals are as cool as ever, and the musicianship is right on par with their other releases, but the great songs just aren't there. I was surprised at this, because before _Nightfall in Middle Earth_ came out I saw a lot of people list this album as Blind Guardian's best. Apparently my expectations were too high. Not to sound too greatly displeased, however, it's still a good album, but I would definitely pick up both _Nightfall in Middle Earth_ and _Somewhere Far Beyond_ first."
5,just unbelievable,"This album is by far the best metal album that the Guardians have recorded to date (obviously not counting Nightfall, which is busy cracking heads with Rush's 2112 for best concept album ever), showcasing both their power and their maturity. If the next album follows in this vein, and Virgin distributes it better, or Century Media re-releases the rest of the catalog, the Guardians will have a hard time _not_ taking over the world."
4,One of their best.,"I you're new to Blind Guardian then I recommend Tales From A Twilight World or Somewhere Far Beyond first, but make no mistake - this is still a great album. [Actually], it was my introduction to Blind Guardian and I was blown away! Generally, it's more epic than those other albums I just listed and it has a more medieval style as well. I'd say the song-writing was more sophisticated too. You're probably asking why they're better albums. Simply because I feel that this album tapers of a bit to the end. The last couple of songs aren't as good as the first few, and generally I feel that the other albums have more good songs. But as I said - still an excellent album. Highly recommended..."
5,A great resource for parents,Simon Johnson picked an opportune time to launch his book. The arrests of the paedophiles and Current Affairs Programs segments on chat rooms predators underline the dangers that can exist on the Internet. The book or rather guide certainly covers the risks to our Kids and pulls no punches. It is an excellent resource for any parent concerned with their child's assess to the Internet. It has all the helpful hints on protecting children from the risks.
3,a little bit out of date,"I found this book a little bit out of date, since software described in it it has changed the book isn't very useful: And it only talks about software, not other techniques.It doesn't explain virtual communities.In this issue, I think the best book is Cyber safe kids, Cyber-savvy teens.Best"
5,Great Product,"Husband has used many power 'staple guns' over the years. Bought this one with the corrugated staples, and says that it is absolutely great. Recently used for 'tacking' 45-degree joints to facilitate setting clamps on joints. Big thumbs-up for a great product."
3,Slipping a little,"Orange Goblin's first 3 albums revived my faith in modern bands to produce good stuff. As an old timer who still has the Black Sabbath and Alice Cooper LPs that first appeared when I was a teenager, OG was a welcome discovery after a decade or three of whiny, self-absorbed [junk].However, Coup de Grace just doesn't grab me the way the first three albums did. I like every song on every other album, but for some reason I just haven't been able to get into this one. The rhythms seem more frantic yet less powerful, and the vocals step out in front of the music rather than blending in with it. IMO 'Red Web', and to some extent 'Stinkin O Gin' would be the only exceptions.I know bands evolve, its a fact of life, but since there aren't any other reviews of this album, I thought I'd toss this out here and hope for a return to roots that aren't that old for these guys yet!"
2,Maybe their worst album,I iked very much Time Travelling Blues and i liked their 2 other previous albums. Well this album unfortunately is a big dissapointment. The riffs and melodies are really terrible. It is just an albim only for huge fans of Orange Goblin or just for collectors. I dont like any song.
4,mind melting horror? mind melting metal,"having been suitibly impressed with frequencies, i bought this album. i was not dissapointed. The difference from previous releases is a change in sound. with a more prominent punk persuasion. The john garcia tracks are a nice touch, reminiscent of unida. Part of me feels a loss of style however it is more than made up for with attitude.buy it."
3,sometimes excellent but spotty,"The author had some sections with great explanations (like sections on bootstrap) but some chapters were overly simplistic or overly complicated. The mathematical parts were neither simple enough for a non mathematician nor extensive enough for someone with a mathematics background to follow. I think the book would have benefited from discussing less subjects but in more detail. Examples would also have helped. The sections on software omit R, which was probably because this was fairly new when the book was written. Several sections referred to StatXact without even naming the tests."
5,Did exactly what it's supposed to do.,Pretty straightforward product. Apply power and it opens. I wasn't able to find one of these locally so I ordered it here. Works well and no complaints.
2,Not so great radio,I bought this radio to listen to when I am doing my houshold chores. It is not the best. The sound cuts out for no reason and the channel changes sometimes when the radio swings around on it's leash. I would not recommend it.
5,Grandmix 2005,The Track listing here is incorrect. For more infomation about this cd go to Benliebrand.nl for complete list of songs.
3,"Acid hippy rock from the 70s, Canada","Don't get confused - this is an album by Canadian band from New Brunswick, and not by cult Joint Effort from Texas (and later Hollywood, 1967).Although highly praised by die-hard fans and considered as a rarity, it is rather sub-standard pirate re-issue of live gig, recorded by the band in 1974 (just before calling it a day).The band was a kind of local attraction in New Brunswick and maybe somewhere else, but never made it big - it might have some appeal for the followers of Crosby, Stills & Co., but otherwise it is not not so remarkable - a couple of covers from Eagles' repertoire, plus America's ""A Horse With No Name"". Predictable acid hippy rock, which varies both musically and sound-wise. The artwork by Maurice Escher is the major achievement.I don't want to be harsh, and perhaps I am the wrong person for this album - I bought it out of greed, and wouldn't recommend to the people who share my taste in music"
4,Gloves,The gloves are in quality and appearance just as expected from the description and the price.
4,I don't know why people give it less than 4 stars.,"This is an excellent cd. It's quite a jump from their original cds and songwriting however, it's for the better. I love the musicality and intricacies. I also like the addition of an epic feel to songs like Eternity and Stratosphere. The singing is a little different but I grew accustomed to it. Overall I would recommend this to any power metal fan."
4,A magical episode...,"Ok, so this is where they touch the starsmaybe Visions has many great tunes, but in the end, we found this as THE stratovarius album to own. Why is that?First of all, there's a great mix between fast songs (father time, will the sun rise, speed of light), and ballads (forever, eternity), and they passed the test with A+The reason why i didn't rate this album with 5 stars, is very simple. This is a masterpiece, but not the top of ther abilities, so, to me, the 5 stars should be considered when that happens (like Metallica's master of puppets, for example)the other reason, is that the riffs in the chorus part of the song ""tomorrow"", are very VERY similar to the ones that appear in ""Forever Free"" (go check it out if you want to), anyway, 4 stars, and a big THANX to stratovarius, you made it this time..."
4,A solid metal album,"""Episode"" contains the best song Stratovarius ever made, ""Night Time Eclipse"", so this CD is special in that respect. You find many great (and fast) songs on ""Episode"", the best of which are ""Father Time"" and ""Speed of light"". This is the first Strato-record with Jens Johansson & Jrg Michael and it could be said that the guys found their style with this record. Definitely a good buy, though ""Babylon"" and ""Season of change"" aren't exactly Stratovarius at its best."
3,I love bizzy Bone music but this is not his best of at all!,"There are a few good songs on here, but whoever decided on this tracklist has absolutely no taste in Bizzy's music. I may have picked a few of these songs but come on this is nowhere near his best songs. Since Bizzy is such a great artist at times this album is still worth 3 stars. I have all his albums so I did not purchase but I guess it is worth buying if you do not have all of his solos. Peace out! redant2"
5,Vanilla beans,Great beans. Nothing like homemade real vanilla. Split them and let them soak in vodka for 5 to 6 months and you will never buy store bought vanilla again.
3,could not get to sprout,I planted these 5 different times and could not get them to germinate. Next I will try a wet paper towel in the fridge and see if that works.
1,Not a single sprout....,"I purchased these seeds from this seller because of the price and a good description. I put all the seeds in a very good rich soil, followed all the necessary directions (believe me I am a good gardened) and.... NOTHING CAME UP!!! I kept waterring for about a month and still nothing... Very disappointed.For the future I will never buy any seeds from unsure source. If I had bought them from Lowes or other local store, I could return there and complain... What to do in my case? Nothing..."
5,"Great germination, beautiful blooming spinach","These seeds were fantastic. Arrived quickly and grew lovely, tasty organic spinach in no time. I planted them the first weekend in September and we're eating delicious spinach today!"
4,"My lover, my enemy","As an officer of the Alliance, Sha'Nara had been trained to destroy the psychics who sought galactic domination. But on a mission to protect the Director-General's daughter, the beautiful bodyguard was abducted by one: Tristan-the most dazzlingly sensual man she'd ever encountered. Far from the monster she'd been prepared for, her enemy was a man whose dreams and desires she admired. And in the duel they waged, she felt him parry every thrust, and found herself pierced to the soul by the riposte of his kiss. Soon the fiery beauty knew that as surely as her body was Tristan's hostage, so was her heart, and she questioned all she'd ever known-for if the Alliance was right and Tristan's people were evil, there would never be a time or a place for their passion. But in his ardent embrace, Sha'Nara found herself hoping, praying, telling herself that they could be together somehow."
4,Nice product could be bigger.,"Nice product but this could be larger in capacity. 1 gallon really is not enough. 2.5 gallon would be perfect. Used as fountian for iced tea at wedding reception. Good product, Sephra is a good company to work wth."
3,"Decent sequel, better than part 2!!!!","It was a big improvement from part 2!! If you watched that one you know what I mean, one question, how is AJ related to both CJ (from part 2) and BJ (from part 1)?! They don't even acknowledge CJ's character in this movie, they say BJ is in jail!! The acting is still bad especially George Boyd!! I recommend it if you watched the first two!!!!"
4,Excellent game for the price.,"This is an excellent game for the money.If you like Splinter Cell and games like it, then you will like this game.Of course, this game is not perfect, but few games are.The XBOX 360 version of the game is probably the one you want. The XBOX 360 achievements, as with most games, give it some additional replay value which is nice."
5,A definite title to own,"This version of Hitman has countless hours of replay value. The Xbox 360 achievements alone will keep you coming back for more. With an almost endless variety of ways to accomplish each hit, you will definitely find interesting combos. The game is also packed full of little surprises (like the Rats Club in Curtains Down). Play as a terrorist who kills all and doesn't care if he is seen or as the coveted silent assassin. Both paths have their benefits. This is a definite buy as even the non-gamer crowd will be drawn in to the world of Agent 47."
4,47 the Hitman,"I never played Hitman before so one day I decided to buy it for $30. When I first played it I thought to myself ""What a great buy"". Hitman is a really a great video game. You can play in either 1st or 3rd person and choose what ever weopons you want. If you buy Hitman: Blood Money you will get addicted and especially when you try to get all of the achievements. There two different ways you can play. They are stealth(like in Splinter Cell)or you can go nuts and shoot everyone. The graphics aren't really Next-Gen but it's nothing to cry about because the game play is just teriffic. If you like shooters and strategy games you will probably love Hitman."
3,Hitman: Blood Money,"Overall, this game was fun to play. It needs more work in regards to character mobility and interaction. However, the 360 degree view is excellent and much needed in a game where the top priority is to remain anyonymous."
1,Garbage,"I don't go around giving 1-star reviews, in fact this is my first.The game is garbage to the point of being unplayable.- Fiber wire, sometimes works sometimes doesn't- Gunplay controls feel terrible- Movement controls feel terrible- Disguising yourself with clothes, is almost random. Sometimes you get thru, sometimes you get caught first second.- The AI is terrible- There's not one aspect of the gameplay that was good- I suspect many of the reviews here are sellers trying to get rid of their copy. As a buyer this was my worst game purchase decision in forever. Avoid."
5,A great Spanish book about butterflies and camoflage,"I like this book because it's a good way to learn about the science of camoflage. Kids' books in Spanish are great ways to add some vocabulary to your repertoire. Ok, so I've misspelled some words. The point is that I like these books because the illustrations are so great, the storyline is fun, and the science is good.These books could even be good for College level Spanish learners."
5,Excellent reference book,"Located in a transition zone between the Sonoran Desert and the tropics,this region is well known for its biodiversity, thanks to a 1942 study by botanist Howard Scott Gentry. Revision of his classic work began before his death in 1993. For researchers, this is a must-read book. It provides a clear overview of botanical studies of the Rio Mayo, a contemporary view of the vegatation, excerpts from the original text and an annotated list of plants."
4,A good Christian thriller that isn't a glorified tract!,"With Virtu@lly Eliminated, Jefferson Scott has given us a very good Christian thriller that itsn't just a gospel tract with a little fictional veneer to make it a nice story. Scott's strongest points in this novel are story/character development, suspensful pacing and believable dialog. If you like technothrillers (e.g. Chrichton and the like), and appreciate a novel without gratuitous cursing, etc., then this is a book for you. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading Terminal Logic (Scott's new novel that I am in the process of ordering from Amazon)."
1,Pattern does not match the other three valances ordered!,"The quality is wonderful, BUT...of the four valances ordered, one pattern does not match the other three. I returned the mismatched valance, only to have the replacement also not match."
1,"Overpriced, go to Bed Bath and Beyond",These valances are 24.99 at Bed Bath and Beyond This is a rip off especially when you add in the shipping.
3,so-so-,"having looked forward to hearing this CD I was somewhat disappointed.tho the musicians are all capable and Harlem Nocturne and Santana's Europa are an allright rendition the rest of the album is somewhat lacking. The vocalists need to concentrate more on silence. This band, group, whatever should stick to polka parties and Jewish weddings."
5,A must have,"A must havethe fact that some can still be found on the web is a real surprise to methe whole ""elvis book"" series stands out vs anything else in the elvis worldall is there: paper quality, large format, all color pix and a textno other work has got such a balance - and all the content is original though copied by bootleggers for their cs coverssean shaver was there with elvis, he invested a lot to be there and asked for nothing else but get pix of the man. He has his own stories to tell and pix to sharethe man deserves our respect and the book deserves to be prizedmikael (from paris)"
4,A Storybook Travel Through Washington State,"Bruce Hansen has written a great travel guide for the motorcycle enthusiast. It doesn't have as much about the roads as it does the places to see and visit. My wife and I have read it cover to cover and Bruce's writing style is easy to read and entertaining. I recommend it for anyone looking to find some out of the way places to visit in our fine state.If you're looking for the best and most challenging roads for motorcycles in Washington, look no further than ""Destination Highways Washington: A Motorcycle Enthusiast's Guide to the Best 346 Roads in Washington State"". This is a very comprehensive collection of the curviest, most scenic, and best engineered roads, and has the best road specific details available.Between these two books, you can't go wrong. Both are well worth reading."
2,not what I was looking for,This book mainly covered west of the cascade mountains. We ride harley's and I was excited to see a book that might give us some new day trips or new places to explore. If you live on the coast it might be useful but if your in the eastern part of Washington I wouldn't get it.
2,Disappointed,"From the title and the various reviews I expected this to show rides from all of the Pacific Northwest. By all definitions Northern California where I live is part of the Pacific Northwest. This book does not cover a single ride in Northern California. It stops at Oregon. I was looking forward to plotting out rides I could go on from my house, as well as further routes. There are literally hundreds of beautiful rides in Northern California, especially the Northern California coast but this book doesn't even mention them."
3,Ok to sit on but it fits loose in the top.,"Pros, Holds 225 lbs of my butt sitting on top of it.Cons, It does not fit snuggly and will come right out. I tried putting some duct tape to snug it a little bit, but it is still loose."
1,Didn't Fit,The lids did not fit the standard buckets that I had. The lid quality appeared to be good though. It was either the bucket or the lid. Either way though they didn't fit.
4,"Good, but maybe not altogether necessary","If you have a scenario where the best place to sit is a bucket, and that bucket for whatever reason can not be turned over in order to sit on the bottom of it, than this item serves a purpose for you. If not, it still serves a purpose, but one which you may want to re-evaluate the urgency of.The design is pretty much flawless. It has channels which prohibit water from gathering in the seat, which is important for outdoor use. It is comfortable, and as far as I've had experience with, it fits all round 5 gallon buckets.However, it is hard plastic. While molded into a more butt friendly shape, it really doesn't facilitate any discernible increase in comfort over an overturned bucket.Ultimately if you need more comfort from your bucket sitting experience, you may want to look into a solution that offers some sort of cushion."
3,Doesn't fit so well,"It's OK, doesn't snap on - just sort of sits on top - afraid it might get lost in a move"
5,Love this thing!,Turns my 5 gallon buckets in to seats in a snap and it nicer than the another 5 gallon bucket seat I have. Giving that one to a friend and getting another one of these.
1,bucket seat,"This does not fit a 5 gallon bucket well-it is to small and comes off easily, not a great product"
5,get what you pay for,"Good product. It shipped quickly and arrived in only 3 days from order. Immediately took it to the garage where I had a 5 gallon bucket waiting. Fit perfect, tight enough not to fall off but loose enough to come off easily. It also has a small triangular tab that can be used with a bungey cord or small rope to tie it to the bucket handle so it doesn't get lost. I'm happy with it."
4,Every garden tool bucket needs one,"I've been using this for a couple years now, after sitting on it a gazillion times it's still hanging in there! Durable product, not 'cushy' but not uncomfortable when working. No spiders have made it to my garden gloves inside so I'm very happy."
4,okay,works well with my bucket and i do like it since i have a tool bag insert. loose fit and does not stay put in a regular empty can. falls out if you tilt the can or flip it.
3,LOOSE FIT,"I bought this seat and a tool apron to go with a 5-gallon bucket. This seat seems reasonably sturdy; however, I expected it to fit a 5-gallon bucket snugly. It doesn't. Thus, I wouldn't buy another one. If you need it, I suggest buying it first and checking the fit before buying/obtaining the bucket."
3,A Little more truth,"This story is not exactly the way I remember it, I guess that is why they call it fiction? All names have been changed to protect the innocent & guilty?? ;)"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this book after reading the rave reviews here, and was very disappointed. The book does contain tips and strategies to help you perform better, but when it came to actually working out answers to questions, _Cracking the LSAT_ failed. The book contained several typos: on p. 117 in the ""Here's how to Crack it"" paragraph, they write, ""You've had (A) in question 5, (B) in question 6, (C) in question 6 ...."" One question cannot have two answers! This example only makes me wonder how many other such errors this book contains. In other ""Here's how to crack it"" sections, the authors did not explain all of the answer choices and why one choice was passed over in favor of the correct one; and more than once, the explanations for sample questions were contradictory. This book did not help me in answering LSAT questions. Instead, I recommened the Triple-Prep books published by LSAC."
5,Great LSAT Book,"The book was great, the shipping was great, and it came to me in an extremely fast manner. Great to do business with!"
2,Major Errors throughout the book,"The book is OK, at best. Chapter 4 - concerning Reading Comprehension Questions - contains an entire section that refers to questions that are not in the book. Full explanations are given, not to the questions in the book, but to some other set of questions from a totally different reading comp passage. After seeing that the problems in that chapter and many other errors throughout the book, I am convinced that the book was very poorly edited. I would not recommend this book to prepare for the LSAT. I rank this book as marginally helpful."
2,Answer mistakes,I'm also disappointed by this book. I've encountered a couple answer mistakes and I've only checked one of the two practice tests so far.
1,I'm glad others know this is bad,"I found it somewhat a relief to find out that others were criticizing this book. Just last night, I was about ready to give up on even studying becuase of that 'social heirarchy' question. What frustrated me is that the reasoning behind one of the WRONG answers could have just as easily applied to the RIGHT answer. Granted there are many well written questions and I allow for imperfections in 'simulations' and just move on but with this one I kept finding myself saying 'yeah, but what about...' etc. I seem to like Kaplan somewhat better after looking at it. I also have ordered the REAL LSATS which is what most people seem to be suggesting. I guess right now I don't know which study guide would be the best but I""m certain in NOT'S PRINCETON."
2,Avoid this if you want to use the CD-ROM,"After spending two hours taking a sample test on CD-ROM, the software would quit with an error every time I tried to grade the test. The written portion of the book is fine (but not without errors) just don't spend any extra money for the CD-ROM version."
1,ABOVE AVERAGE TEST TAKERS BE CAREFUL,"These books are ok but they aren't for everyone. I test well on standardized tests and took a practice test and scored very high. The more i worked in this book, the slower I became and the lower i scored. Take a practice test-If you are someone who scores high on standardized tests usually, you may just want to take the test on adrenaline and your good wits. That is what I will be doing next time, as I did on the SAT's as well. These books help lots of people I'm sure, but this is one case where someone scored significantly lower due to practicing methods not necessarily needed."
2,Don't waste your time,"This is the first book I bought and I wish I'd made a different choice.Although the writers of the book try hard to be clever, their tone is patronizing. The technique sections are superficial and are not followed up by practice sections. This makes for a very dull and tedious read.However, the CD-ROM has four practice tests that you can grade and review (although some seemed easier than real tests) so okay for instant gratification."
4,Pin Curl Clips,Product was received in a timely matter and was the same as advertised. I would purchase again from this seller in the future.
5,Shake yo money maker - worth every penny,I bought this as a gift for my dad who is an avid blues lover and he was so impressed and happy that i was able to find the CD for him. He hasn't stop listening to it.
4,For the Price it does the job....,"Great price. Wish the quality was a little better. Since I wear them to run every day, I don't see them lasting very long."
3,Not very sturdy,I liked the description of the product and it came on time. The product is not very study and has started to have frayed ends.
1,Not worth the money,"I feel buying this DVD was a waste of money. You can find plenty of free videos online for general interview tips, and tons of resources to help with the medical school application and interview process (try studentdoctor.net). You're already paying out the nose for MCAT prep (not to mention the MCAT itself) and med school applications; no sense spending more money to prepare for something you can't really prepare for.Medical school interview tip #1: Keep your cool and be yourself!"
3,Worth about $19,"This DVD did provide me with some insight into the process but only went over a handful of questions. Like most in this situation, I have felt desperate to increase my odds of success, and gladly paid the $30. If you can stand the urge that you may miss some mystical secret, you may want to watch Youtube interview videos and read books about interviewing instead...I don't know if I could take my own advice though. Dr. Ferdinand knows what he is talking about but the information is too limited and it is too short for the money."
1,Not what you want!,"You start by watching a girl that is terrible at interviewing ... Then he critiques her interview. The information he gives is good, but you can get that same information by reading one of the med school interview books or watching youtube videos. agreed, not worth the price."
3,Okay movie,"My daughter is 9 and LOOOOVES mermaids. I bought the movie hoping it would have lots of mermaid scenes in it. Sadly, it doesn't. The movie itself is okay and entertaining, but would be dissapointing to a little girl hoping to see lots of mermaid action. I recommend ""Fish Tales"", which I also bought. Lots of mermaid scenes in it! ;)"
5,Not Who You Think.,"Be advised: this is the *other* Bill Evans. Not the modern jazz pianist, but the progressive bluegrass banjo player. But if that interests you, you'll enjoy this immensely. Evans is a master of his instrument and has assembled some top flight players to join him on this well recorded CD. He's also a darn good tunesmith, as all but one of songs presented are his own compositions."
4,So Far so Good,I recently received this product. It apprears to be a good deal. It is heavier than other clippers. I turned it on and it virbrated a lot.
2,Wahl 79900B Clip-N-Trim 23-PC Complete Haircut Kit..not so complete,I have cut my husbands hair for 3 years now. I have always used Wahl products and never have encountered a problem until I bought this item. The trimmer does not align correctly to the main blade and therefore does not make the proper horizontal movement to actually cut the hair. I ended up returning it. The only good thing I can say was that amazon did a great job with delivery time and accepting return/crediting my account. Over all I recommend Amazon; I do not recommend this product. I would purchase a Wahl product that has the smaller trimmer separately (not interconnected with the main trimmer. Thank you.
2,Very noisy,"I've been cutting my husband's hair for 18 years, with a Wahl. I purchased a new one, 23-Piece, almost a year ago, and while it does cut hair pretty well and all the accessories are there and nicely marked, due to the noise I am giving up on it. It never was very quiet, but now some attachments cause it to make such a loud noise that it's unbearable. Yes we have tweaked with the screw on the side but to no use."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I bought this since my haircut is pretty simple. Slap on a #3 guard and go. My wife is cutting my hair with this now and hasn't had any problems with it. It also saves me $20 every time I get my hair cut so it's definitely worth the investment. The only problems I have with it is that it's not very easy to clean up and the included apron thing is pretty much useless. Other than that, it cuts well and even has pretty good instructions included."
3,Very Loud,"It cuts great but very very loud. I had to use ear plug. I already used it twice and compare to what they charge for the hair cut today, it's already paid off."
5,Best clippers ever,Absolutely pleased.Great for beard trim also.I've never been displeased with Wahl
4,great item for the price,"I had a Wahl trimmer for 20 years and it finally gave out so i gave this one a try.Well it works great, my old one was a little better but for this price i can't complain."
4,Awesome!,"This is great. It pays for itself quickly, and my haircut went effortlessly.No pulled hairs -- this is definitely a nice cutter, and I appreciate the effort that went into it. The price just went down too! I think I paid $29 on amazon. But worth it regardless of the price. One thing, sometimes it's confusing finding the blades because they're all black. Would be nice to have a multicolored one.And also-- no battery charger!! This is definitely annoying, but not too bad, since I live in a cold climate and wouldn't be able to cut my hair outside for 8 months of the year."
3,Decent for the money,used once and works fine. several of the pieces do not fit properly on the clipper which causes it to rattle and be extremely loud. although after one more clip it will have already paid for itself.
4,Well worth money,"This is a pretty decent trimmer set for how relatively cheap it is. You could spend $100 and get a better one but it's not worth it in my eyes. So far I've owned this product for about 6 months and its never presented me with any problems. The detail trimmer is a bit loose and makes an obnoxious noise if you don't keep a little pressure on it, but that wouldn't be a deal breaker in my opinion. I've saved so much money it's ridiculous. At this point if you're in the market for a trimmer I'd say this one should be up for consideration because it's cheap and does the job well w/o pulling any of the hairs out of your head. Quit making the hair stylists richer and just order one, you will be so happy you did."
4,A gal's view,"I bought these clippers after spending over 80 dollars (again) for a horrid haircut. My hair is ultra thin, fine, and prone to breakage no matter what high end products I Use. Six months ago, I decided to go super short. Problem? Finding stylists who know what they are doing. I tried a barbershop once, but ended up looking like I was AWOL from boot camp.These clippers were easy to use and gave great results. I have never shaved my own hair before, but the instructions were clear and it was a fun experience in a strange sort of way. One problem was that the instructions describing the clippers were incorrect (color coded instead of all black), but the guard combs were clearly marked so I couldn't screw up.Being a novice, I was nervous about trying this, and my hair ended up shorter than I intended. If your hair is thin, use a longer length comb. Otherwise, very easy to do and no bald spots from the salon! Well worth the low price and has already paid for itself."
4,Very good product with one problem,"I brought this set about six month ago and has used it for a few times. It gets the job done, nicely at this price, and that's why I would give 4 stars for it. The issue so far is that the trimmer (which has been criticized by some other users): it is very fragilely connected to the clipper. To make things worse, the clipper will produce a very loud noise when the trimmer part is connected. I discovered this problem and removed the trimmer permanently; problem solved! I would suggest the producer improve the design about the trimmer part (or maybe just simply remove it!) which is really useless and sometimes can be really annoying.At this price, I'm happy enough to have such a sturdy tool to save money on my haircut. If you are looking for something economic to cut your hair, this can be what you are looking for!"
3,Don't make them like they used to..,"Wahl 79900N Clip-N-TrimI have to agree with one of the other reviewers that the detail trimmer is not the best quality. It's flimsy and doesn't clip on like the other attachments. It takes fiddling to get it to work and the plastic seems like it will break eventually. The case that it comes in is roomier that the last wahl I had but again the quality is subpar. The plastic pieces are used to hold the clipper/trimmer unit was broken off with this unit and 1st one I received. Also the first 79900N that arrived looked like it had been opened and tampered with before I received it. The level attachments have been 'downgraded' from the older version that I had, the plastic is more flimsy and thinner.With that said, the clipper itself seems like a decent economy item."
5,Second one I bought,"I have owned this model for a couple of years and it has been used many times. We now have ""haircut night"" where it gets used for several haircuts in a row. It is starting to shows signs of slowing down, in really thick hair. Time to buy a new one so why mess around, this one was so good I have bought another.Angelo ""the town barber "" must hate these things.."
4,"Great product, but don't count on the flipover trimmer part.","This is the very first trimmer I ever used. I was tired of waiting in line and paying what I can do at home in 15 minutes. The trimmer is fairly easy to use and requires minimal maintenance. (I just brushed the hair off after each use.)It would deserve a full 5-star if the latch of flip-over fine trimmer didn't break the first time I used it. The fine trimmer still works with my thumb pressing to hold it in place. Since then, I have given and received haircuts 20+ times using it (that's what starving graduate students do other than subsisting on Ramen noodles.) When I save enough money, I think I will simply get a beard trimmer to do the fine touches. After all, one can't expect a $20 tool to do everything."
3,Just good for the Price,"Its a very robust tool! is heavy and very noisy, but works great.As a bad thing... he plastic part of the detail trimmer is cracked.i prefer to spend a little more money for a more light and silent trimmer."
3,Not so great ..,"The clipper vibrates and makes humming sound.Not so loud, but still not ignorable. The conair is much quieter.The cutting is fine. Does the job as intended.Don't think of returning this one."
1,Disgusting! Will never buy personal home products from Amazon again!,"Was looking into buying a hair trimmer at a competitive price since my old one has died on me. I looked around on Amazon for what would be a good trimmer based on customer reviews. I read plenty of reviews that reported customers buying NEW trimmers from Amazon but unfortunately, they were receiving USED trimmers. I took the gamble, what are the chances right? First thing I did when I got the trimmer was look for hair and skin follicles. I am unhappy to say that I found plenty of hair and skin and was actually happy to have received a used trimmer because this will be the last time I buy any home or personal use item from Amazon. I kept the trimmer because I needed it that day, so I just disinfected it. If Amazon only cared enough to sell what they say they sell, they could keep a loyal customer base. They have officially lost a lot of $$$$ from me, and that's too bad."
1,Not My Ideal Hair Clipper,"After reading all the reviews and seeing the star ratings, I'd thought this would be the best hair clipper. However, I was instead very displeased with the product. First of all, the hair clipper is really bulky and heavy. Product dimensions are listed at 4 pounds. Secondly, I had a problem with the attachments. They did not fit sturdy on the clipper and made a rattling noise when it was turned on. Lastly, the whole thing is just way too noisy. I felt like I was about go deaf when cutting near my ear. Despite the many positive reviews, I would really try to avoid this product.I also looked into other hair clippers and bought the Wahl 9655 Rechargeable Clipper. The power is ridiculously weak and stops when the hair gets too thick.I am done with Wahl products. They're are honestly all very poorly made. Better luck with everyone else's experience."
5,The BEST body clipper for the money !,Like I said...the best clipper for the money. Hands down. I clip my entire body and this does the trick. My old clippers would pinch my skin at times...not with these. Awesome product.
5,The GIs love it,"I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law. He is a soldier in the U.S. Army. He loves it because he can cut his own hair very, very short. It is also very popular with other soldiers in his outfit, they keep borrowing it. If you want to send a soldier a gift, send one of theses. Tested and approved by U.S. Army soldiers."
2,Detail Trimmer is not of good quality,"The detail trimmer is of plastic and the mechanism is not of good quality. It does not serve hte purpose of a detail trimmer. i intend to go for hte Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper & Trimmer, 27 Pieces"
3,busted,I just got mine in the mail today and the product must have been updated because the accessories I recieved are not what is displayed on the website. Amazon you need to update. I did not recieve a neck brush and only one comb. To top it all off the plastic part of the detail trimmer is cracked. I have not used it yet but hopefully it will work.
2,Poor quality,"Cheap trimmer with a lot of extras, but the overall quality of the parts is pretty poor... The plastic parts for the length adjustment were bent after using them for like 3 times. I would recommand to go for a more expensive product, if you plan to use it regularly..."
3,good but needs improvment,"Definetly cheap, but you can buy a more expensive version which will pay for itself too. noisy. gets hot easily. side trimmer is useless. catches onto hair if you go a little bit faster, and that is so annoying. I'm buying a different one."
2,"Amazon, please stop sending me used items","I cannot provide a full review of this clipper because Amazon sent me a used one. It was pretty gross to see hair stubs. However repackaged tried their best to make it look new. As for the item, I cannot use it. However from observation, there is a broken plastic piece on the lid for the trimmer."
4,No need for a Barber any longer..,"Purchesed this product after reading many reviews. We were looking to save some money on haircuts for the hubby & figured for the price why not give this clipper a try. I basically just started out using the longer comb guides until the length of hair cut looked the way we wanted (you can always take more hair off, but you can't put it back on if you cut too much off). If you follow the instructions it's not that difficult. I would guess over time I will get even better & faster. I may even feel brave enough to experiment on different styles. I wouldn't ever attempt to use it on my hair, but I'm a female that requires more style then a buzz cut."
2,Broke After 3 Uses,"I've only used the unit 3 times, and the flip-over trimmer broke when I ""flipped"" it over to attach to the main clipper head. The plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head, that cracked in two, and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor. It's very disappointing. I'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer, I can't seem to find the receipt."
4,Good for home use,"I cut my own hair (what's left of it), and this is perfect for me. The clipper is strong and cuts very well, and rarely ever pulls out my hair.I don't love the attached close trimmer, it tends to be a little flimsy and a little awkward to use. Also, some of the length attachments seem to just be for show... I can't imagine anyone buzzing their hair on the longer settings... doesn't really seem to have a point. The scissor isn't terrific, but you're not buying this for the scissor... think of it more as an extra.The set, as a whole, does a great job... and has saved me a whole lot of money."
4,hmmm ... useable cheap clippers with way too many attachements,"the 23 pieces consists of mostly clip on depth guides ... not sure how many ... around 12 of them ... you really only need like 5 at best. The scissors are cheap. The clippers are good for shaving your head and giving yourself a buzz cut with an 1/8"" depth guide. I use them every two weeks and for that they work perfectly. I never pay for a haircut."
1,Save your money!,"I got this because I was impressed with everything it came with for such a low price.I used it for the first time today and it is awful. It is so loud!! I had to put duct tape over the trimmer area to keep it from being so loud. My son was scared of the noise so I had to do something. The plastic attachments are junk!! The are so flimsy when you start clipping the hair they bend to the side and don't stay in place.Seriously the best thing about this whole kit was the cape it came with, worked well keeping my son hair free."
1,Hair Trimmer Broke,"Hi All,Dont buy this item,as this is made of poor quality Plastic.Its hair trimmer broke after the 2nd use."
4,"Wahl clipper, very satified.","I cut my husbands, sons and grandsons hair, I have had a Wahl for many years and it finally went to hair heaven. I purchased another brand and quickly took it back, it wouldn't even trim there necks. I went to Amazon and pulled up Wahl and ordered one. I am very satified and it cuts wonderfully."
4,It's cool,This is a great product. It's great to put your feet on while sitting in your comfy chair or using it as a table while sitting on the floor. Very sturdy and easy to keep clean.
4,"good product, ? on packaging","We bought blue and raspberry bean bags for our kids for Christmas. The blue came first and shipped ahead (in a box), the raspberry came a week later (which was fine), but was NOT in a box and in just a see-through plastic bag. We were shocked to come home and find it still there in our driveway. Wasn't too happy about that. The bean bags are nice though."
3,Not what the picture looks like....,The shape of this beanbag once delivered isn't at all like it is in the picture. Overall not a bad beanbag but just not in the sit up shape as pictured.
1,Not worth the money,"I spent several days looking at bean bags on Amazon. Against my better judgement, I purchased this bean bag that had no reviews at the time. Everything in the description looked good! Unfortunately when we got the bag we notice that every time you sat on it, moved it around...basically used it, that the filling was seeping out of the seams. When we opened it up, the bag was filled with what appeared to be crushed/grated styrofoam. It was coming out of the seams because some of the filling was super fine like shavings/dust. It was a mess! Since I had noticed that there was a 15% restocking fee and I would have to ship it back, I kept it and cleaned it out. We had to replace the filling with a better material. Nasty filling! I would not recommend purchasing this item."
4,Big Enough for Adult,"I ordered two of these for our basement. These are definitely big enough for an adult - I'm glad I went with the Extra Large. They are a little stiff so you kind of have to mold it into how you want it to be....I assume they will ""break in"" after a few months of use. Overall I'm very happy with the quality and size of the bean bag."
4,beanbag,"Works well for my wife AFTER removing a significant amount of the styrofoam beads. It was too ""full"" prior to this to be comfortable."
2,GOES FLAT - BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM HOME AND LIVING,"Shipped in just a thin plastic bag. 1st one came with a cut in it. I ordered 2 and they were not the same size. I called Home and Living customer service and they agreed to send me refill. After 2 months of waiting and numerous calls to them, I never got the refill (I gave up). These bags went flat after a couple of weeks of use. Deffinately not worth the price paid - about $60 each."
4,Vary satisfied,I bought this bean bag chair for my grandson's birthday that was what he wanted and was so happy he sits in it while watching tv and playing video games. He did not know that I was getting it for him he saw a huge box arrived and was so excited to open it up and saw the chair. Thanks for making my grandson so happy!!
1,Made with material that is know to cause cancer,I returned it because it had a sticker added to the tag that said that that more or less this bean bag can cause cancer and birth defects.
1,Plastic Blanket!!!,"Not worth the money!! This bean bag chair lasted only a little over 4 months. All the beans are flat so its not worth the 1/2 refund. I bought this for my son's 10 B-day he weighs about 85lbs. I have even refilled it once, and it still wont hold the shape. Very dissapointed. Funny thing Is I bought one for my 9 yr old son at a second hand store that looked cheaper but for 2 dollars it is still holding its shape and is still full!!! and its been three and 1/2 months."
3,Beanbag chair and bead fill,"The beanbag chair appeared to be of adequate quality. However, we were puchasing it for our 4-year-old grandaughter who has significant physical disabilities. This chair was definitely not big enough for her, nor was it stable enough for a child who could not sit without support."
4,Love this extra large,We bought beanbag chairs last year and were ruined within the first two weeks of Christmas...this chair is higher quality and definitely made to last...the price was a bit excessive for what it is but at least the quality appears to be here....let's see how long this lasts
1,"A work of fiction, file it next to Dan Brown",This book takes liberties with it's sources and attempts to take half-truths and spin innuendo on top them to provide another urban myth. The factual inaccuracy is breath-taking and the book is highly selective in reporting/spinning certain events. It is safe to assume that the author would find himself in court if some of the individuals mentioned in the book were alive today.
3,Detailed,"Excruciatingly detailed account of the ugly business of war. Frightening and meticulously researched, this book is not easy reading. I found it somewhat dull because of the writing style, but for those interested in WW2 or for those who lived through I would still recommend it."
1,Not a single source reference,"The book makes radical claims but does not have a single source referenced throughout 220+ pages of its text to substantiate its allegations.It does include an appendix with the list of books and documents that the author allegedly used, however there are no references to these sources from the main text to support author's statements, and the document list is not accompanied by archival case numbers. Some of the documents, for example, are listed as ""FBI Reports, Various, 1942"".Overall, the book appears to be of the genre generally described as ""folk history"".Tellingly, search in JSTOR database does not find a single academic review of the book. As a matter of fact, there are only two references to the book at all -- one in a theoretical article unconcerned with particulars of real history, another in an article published by Canadian labor history magazine."
2,Cheap bootleg copy!,This title has never been released on DVD by the company that owns the rights to it. A Chinese 'import' but with NTSC coding? Obviously a bootleg.
4,"Buy it for John Hubley's ""Moonbird""","This has a mix of good and bad public domain animation just like the other Toon Factory $1 DVDs, however, this one stands out because it includes famed animation director John Hubley's 1959 Academy Award-winning short ""Moonbird."" This short is also on ""The Hubley Collection - Volume 1"" DVD, but that costs upwards of $20! It's a brilliant short and worth more than the price of this $1 DVD. There's also a notable Orson Welles-narrated short from 1971 called ""Freedom River.""The 17 shorts in this collection are:1) The Big Bad Wolf2) Toonerville Picnic3) Flop Goes the Weasel4) Freedom River5) Frozen Frolics6) A Scout with the Gout7) To Spring8) Goofy Goofy Gander9) Ding Dong Doggie10) Wolf! Wolf!11) Bored of Education12) Snubbed by a Snob13) Moonbird14) Gold Rush Daze15) Shuteye Popeye16) Out to Punch17) Insect to Injury"
3,Not for Big Boys,"I was looking forward to this title and had heard good things about it. But I was disappointed as I felt I should be reading it aloud to a five year old instead of for myself. While the artwork is decent, it is not nearly good enough to make up for this tale for tots."
2,Pretty pictures to satisfy concept-art nerds,"I quit reading about 1/5th of the way in because the story was beyond tedious. It's really just a concept art book with a boring story slapped on. It seems clear that Chiang is a talented artist who is completely out of his element when it comes to actually ILLUSTRATING. Telling a story with pictures. I've never read any Orson Scott-Card before, but I can't imaging any writer worth anything wanting to have their fingerprints on this train-wreck."
5,Robota,"Stunning Artwork and Extraodinary Characters!I received my copy of Robota last week from Amazon, a month before the scheduled release date and I have immersed in it for the past five (5) days. Seriously, I cnnot pull myself away from this great book. This book is truly one of the incredible I've seen in many years. The artwork is amazing! Chiang's paintings simply take your breath away.The collaboration between Doug Chiang and Orson Scott Card has resulted in an outstanding book. Chiang's incredible artistry blows me away and Card has a brillaint grasp of human emotion and personal interactions. The story is completely engrossing. It's no wonder these two guys have achieved such success in their respective careers.What more can I say. I love this book and highly recommend it. I plan on taking good care of it and passing it down from generation to generation like a family treasure."
5,The Wait is Over!,"Man meets robot. Great storyline, tremendous conflict, and profound illustrations make for a wonderful book. A must-add to your science fiction collection, along with Star Wars and the Matrix. Go to places in Robota that you could never go in real life."
4,cool story and awesome photos,More of a portfolio from Star Wars concept artist Doug Chaing but an awesome story to group his amazing art with storytelling! A must have for any future artist or sci-fi fan! A rare book!
5,"Home, Sweet Home","I work for a school that just purchased 600 acres of the ranch described in this book. The area IS as beautiful as she describes, is as rugged and the people are just as hard-working and caring.I found the book to be a great story. She says she is just a story-teller, but what a good one! It makes the past come alive. My husband and I read parts of it out loud, while camping in the very ranch she describes.WARNING! Once you start, it is hard to put down."
4,Who the heck are Publishers Weekly?,"Check out this quote from Publishers Weekly listed above... ""In 1966, Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys released a revolutionary rock album that would influence the Beatles' Rubber Soul..."" I find this very odd given the fact that Rubber Soul was released in December of 1965 and Pet Sounds wasn't released until May of 1966. Duh!"
5,"Whoops, you're both wrong.","I haven't read the book yet, but Wilson's inspiration for Pet Sounds was the Beatles' Rubber Soul, while the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper was subsequently influenced by Pet Sounds. When Pet Sounds was released, the Beatles were already working on Revolver, their album between Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper."
2,Several mistakes,"I'm surprised at how many little mistakes there are in this book. I found three during discussions of the individual tracks. Pg 90. Wouldn't It Be Nice. You know the more we seem to talk about it should be ""You know it seems the more we talk about it. "" pg 105. I Know There's An Answer. Says the b section of the verse starts with I Know there's An Answer. It should read "" But what Can You Tell Them"" . Finally, pg 106. Here Today may be semantics but it states the structure as 8,7, and 5 bars respectively. It actually appears to be more like 8, 6, and 6. I suppose this last one could be subjective, but to my ear, and with the way the instrumental section feels, that's how it sounds. I hate to nitpick, but I hope the rest of the book is a bit more accurate. I am a huge fan, and this album has inspired me beyond words. Thank you Brian and Tony for giving the world this piece of work."
5,The Pet Sounds Bible,I loved this book! I have been a PET SOUNDS diehard for six years now and nothing I've read on the album so far has answered all the questions I had. This book does that and more. He explains why this album was so brilliant. He explains wonderfully the collaboration process between Brian Wilson and Tony Asher. He gives a pre-Pet Sounds examination of the Beach Boys catalog to show how Brian grew artistically as well as a post-Pet Sounds examination of Brian's random spouts of greatness. This book has everything you could want. It is written by a man who truly loves PET SOUNDS and understands every fans need to personally thank Brian for this gorgeous album that changed our lives.
3,review of the physical book,"I really pushed this book to the limits. The front cover is pretty thin, so it bends after a few uses. I tried putting it under a few heavy books, but it still flips up. The pages aren't bound with thread... their glued, so expect some fall out after a while if you bend the pages back too far. I also highlighted a lot, and it kinda bled through with a new highlighter, but not so much with an older one.I would suggest a different copy if you can find one, especially if your going to be using this book heavily."
5,Very good workout :-),"I haven't got many of The Firm workouts because their older ones didn't do it for me and so I didn't give many of their newer ones a go. This however, appealed to me as a straight toning workout and I really enjoy it a lot. Allie Del Rio Pointer is a new instructor to me, and I found her to be very good, not annoying and easy to follow along to.The entire workout uses weights and to get maximum results, nearly every fast paced exercise works multiple muscles in one go. She also starts with a basic routine and then adds modifications to increase intensity. I also like this because all you need is two sets of weights and you're good to go.This is a good 40 minute routine to really do almost every muscle in your body and based on this workout, I'll definately give The Firm more tries. I enjoy this and highly recommend it."
1,"Disappointing, like other new Firm DVDs","I love the Firm and particularly Allie, but I'm very disappointed with this and the other new Firm DVDs. Some of the four-limb segments are good, but I find the aerobics segments unnecessarily complicated and they don't even raise my heart rate. With my older Firm DVDs, I always feel like I've had a workout; with these new ones, I don't. Also, these new routines feel harder on my knees (because of twisting more than impact) and back. I have minor back problems, and I find myself modifying the moves in these new DVDs to protect my back from being strained/""put out."" And I miss the fannylifter/transfirmer. I don't know if these changes are because Gaiam now owns the Firm, but I really hope they go back to the more intense, more straight forward routines. I would return this one and get my money back if I could. Sorry Allie!"
3,just o.k.,"I am a firm junkie and especially like Allie Pointer, but this was a little bit of a letdown. I think this would be a good beginner video for someone NOT looking for a cardio video. This is definitly more of a cross-trainer. I really would like to see more of the old transfirmer upper body moves integrated with some tougher plyometrics like in Allison Davis bootcamp video (which is tough )now that would be the total package!I hope they can make my wish come true since the last few videos have been not so good.(sculpt and burn, time crunch, killer legs) they just don't have that old muscle exaustion I love.Stacie"
4,Nice toning video,"I like this one. It does the job in a short amount of time. It doesn't burn many calories, but it does tone your body."
5,My absolute favorite exercise video,This video is the perfect length and it gives you a decent cardio workout while toning. I love how they get your upper body and lower body working at the same time. Very efficient.
4,I liked this one.,Out of all of these new Firm dvds this one is my favorite and honestly the only one I will continue to do occasionally. I got the Transfirmation set and those were terrible. This dvd is good though. Enjoyed it.
2,Firm Not What It Used To Be,"Some of the moves are new and interesting, but overall the workout is too short, not enough reps on anything except lunges. I am returning and buying FitPrime and Tracie Long DVD's; in the meantime I'm pulling out old Firm videos from the attic."
1,Short and Incomplete,"This workout is very, very short, and lacks any rhythm or development. Indeed, much of the supposed length of the video is spent telling the names of the women in the video. Good workout videos gradually introduce movements and then proceed to incorporate those movements in a creative and yet logical way into a full, robust workout. This video confusingly introduces a bunch in a small space and then never builds on them; we kept looking for a second chapter entitled ""workout,"" but alas, it's not there. Very disappointing. p.s. If you do decide to buy this for whatever reason, know that dumbbells are required, not ""optional"" as stated on the cover."
5,I love this one!,"Allie is a great instructor. She's clear and gives you encouragement during the whole video. Also she throws out phrases like ""you'll looke great in those jeans, sexy shoulders and backside"". My favorite is ""zap those hips away"".Although it's recommended to use light, medium and heavy weights, I just use three pound and five pound weights. You use them during the whole workout. There is a beginers version and advanced version.You swat, bend, pump weights, sqeeze gluts, crunch the entire time. I feel guilty when I skip a day.I've been using it for a month. I notice my baby gut is slowly going away, my thighs are tighter and loosing inches. Plus I've been watching what I'm eating.I highly recommend this video."
5,Great Video!,"I am a huge FIRM fan, and my collection seems to grow weekly! This video is one of my favorites, although I keep having to switch them up to make sure I dont get too used to it :) I would definitely recommend it, its tough but doable and I think Allie is one of the better instructors the Firm has!"
3,Good workout - not enough reps,"I like all the moves, I like Allies techniques, but there just aren't enough reps to feel like it is working. I'll stick with it, but I find all of the new Firm videos are so abbreviated compared to the old ones. I still do the old ones and they really kick butt. Funny having to watch their outdated outfits and such but they are still the best."
5,The Firm - Total Body Toner,Allie at her best! Results in less than 10 workouts. Great when paired with the Cardio Inferno for alternating days. You won't get bored with this one.
2,Big disappointment,"I'm really disappointed with this video. I thik Allie's queuing is much better than some of the new Firm instructors but the video was still a bit tough to follow, mostly due to the really poor camera work. Most of the time the shots were very tightly zoomed when I really wanted a whole body shot so I could actually see how to do the moves. This seems to be a problem for all the new Firm videos. I won't be buying another one. As for the music, I'm not sure who it was trying to appeal to; it goes from rock to electronica, to disco and isn't right at all for the pacing. The only good part about it is that the music is so soft you can tune it out."
3,Bizarre,"The film focuses too much on a miscast, cadaverous Gary Cooper. Deborah Kerr's character is interesting, but she looks bored throughout most of the film. Eric Portman is delightfully evil and sinister. You will never view bathtubs or razors the same way after the finale!"
2,"Good idea, but not worth it","The premise of this book really interested me, but upon finishing it, I wished I had used my time for something else. It's a shame, because the first chapter does a good job of grabbing the reader's attention and setting up the book. Once again, however, I find that a full-length novel by Ballard has only enough plot for a short story. The whole car crash-eroticism idea is an intriguing one, but it can't substitute for a storyline. Ballard goes into overkill, beating the reader over the head with all the minute erotic aspects of car crashes; meanwhile, the plot becomes less and less important, and the characters remain stagnant. I would almost say that this book is a parody of a sex-thriller, but after reading ""Crash"", I think that the other has more merit.*Also, I found Ballard's use of smells in this book laughable. The main character must have some Bloodhound in him."
4,Not for the faint of heart,"Holy cow, is this book INTENSE. Ballard takes a patently out-there concept--a gang of car-crash enthusiasts who derive erotic pleasure from getting maimed in accidents--and makes it vivid and compelling, if not exactly plausible. Written in tightly coiled prose reminiscent of Don DeLillo, ""Crash"" seems excessively repetitive with all these endless descriptions of carnal doings in smashed-up cars, but keep in mind that a book about obsessive behavior perhaps ought to be obsessive in its execution. This is a gutsy book, one that makes ""Tropic of Cancer"" look like Oprah Book Club material. (I found myself wondering how Ballard managed to get it published at all. I even found myself wondering how he managed to stay out of jail.) It is not for everyone, but for adventurous readers it is a memorably wild ride through the dark side of the human psyche."
2,One idea doesn't make a book.,"Ahead of its time, yes. Disturbing, yes. Would make a great 5 page short story, yes. Is it a good book? No. It's prolonged and boring. After a hundred pages reading the same thing over and over again becomes a torture, the characters are underdeveloped, and the plot is almost non-existent.This book would've made a wonderful short story. It's written in good style, but if you skip a page, or two, or ten at a time, you're not missing much.I recommend it only for its novelty value."
1,Trash,"Ballard's writing has a certain descriptive fluency and some of his earlier short stories were good. It is depressing to see a real talent turned to the production of pretentious, convulsive trash. Who needs a guided tour through nasty, pointless obsessions?"
1,An Awful Book,"Two-thirds of the way through it, and not going to finish it. It is garbage. It doesn't have a single redeeming quality. Even the use of language is poor. It's just an endless, nauseating, and thoroughly perverted musing about semen, crotches, and crumpled vehicles. Even the one or two times an infant appears in the book, it is involved in a sex act.Can't imagine what the author and publisher were thinking. Worthless trash."
1,Dumb Cult Classic,"This is the stupidest book I've read in a long, long, long time. Why it's a cult classic is beyond me."
1,Over Descriptive,"I purchased this book because I am a big Spader fan, and James Spader played the leading role in the movie. If I had not seen the movie, I more then likely would never of purchased the book, and I would never of gotten past the second chapter.Every paragraph is so over descriptive, and it's confusing to process if the character is day dreaming at any given time or actually doing something.I finb it a little errie that J.G. Ballard names himself as the character in the book."
2,Kind of dumb.,"I bought this book for two reasons. First, I like David Cronenberg movies a lot and I wanted to read this before I watched the film. Secondly, Ballard was recommended to me because I liked ""Fight Club"" and other books of the genre. I didn't like ""Crash"" a whole lot though. Sure, the idea of people obsessing with the sexuality surrounding car crashes is original, but it's a bit tiresome when it's dragged on for 200 pages (thank goodness the book isn't longer). I guess the book would have been a lot better if it hadn't repeated itself so often. I tired after the fourth or fifth time the main characters had sex after either causing a car crash, witnessing a car crash, or staging one. I gave this two stars rather than one because it has potential to be a good book. I don't know if I'll like Ballard's other works. I also want to say the Cronenberg film was pretty dumb too."
1,Excruciatingly dull....,"This book *desperately* wants to shock and disturb you. Unfortunately, Ballard's hackneyed prose only succeeds in boring the reader to distraction.The third time Ballard used the phrase ""natal cleft,"" I threw the book across the room in frustration. You know an author is reaching when he runs out of synonyms for CROTCH!! (Perhaps Ballard needs Roget's Sexual Thesaurus!)I regret that I can never reclaim the precious hours I wasted reading the first half of this book. My only consolation is that I DIDN'T read the second half.Do yourself a favor and avoid *both* halves of ""Crash."""
2,AUTO-erotica??,"This book is really just a relatively boring look at perverse psychological adaptation. I didn't find it disgusting or disturbing, just an overly magnified examination of sado-masochism bound to modern machinery. The author's relatively sparse insights are suffocated by his dronning repetition and zombie-like characters."
2,Don't Be Fooled,"I've read a lot of books from various genres and written by crazy authors. I have to say though, that this book is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. The story is completely disjointed, and you have no connection to the characters (you neither hate them, nor love them). I absolutely did not care what happened at the end of this novel. Given all this, the reason I allowed this novel to have two stars is because of the lack of emotions in the characters and the storyline - this seems to be a central theme. All the characters are striving to have some kind of emotional attachment to SOMETHING, whether it be cars, or people, or whatever. The author has done a spectacular job of extracting emotion from the characters and the story. This being said, the story is so terrible that I would never recommend this novel to anyone."
3,"Is it genius, or just strange?","While the idea behind crash is certainly original enough to give Ballard props, the book itself, at least to me,was almost one-dimensional. The point of the whole sex/auto/violence thing, while an interesting analogy and comment, can't sustain itself over the length of the book, because there's not a lot else there to hold everything together. The graphic content just seems ot hang there sometimes. To that end, the book is far from brilliant; it's just weird and quirky. Worth reading? Yeah, why not? It's well-written and, as noted earlier, certainly original, and about as different as you can get. But I wouldn't put it on the ""immortal literature"" shelf."
2,"Repetitive, taboo for the sake of being taboo, overly-long.","I really wanted to read this as a darkly-poetic statement about the direction in which our technology is taking us and/or alienation and the desire for connection (physical or otherwise), but was just too personally alienated (perhaps intentionally?) by all the issues I mentioned in the title-line to do so. I can appreciate the power of creating characters the reader doesn't entirely relate to, whether for the purpose of exploring a taboo or some sort of disjuncture or any other desired intellectual terrain, but the author's repetition and lack of major progression made it hard to even appreciate this book as an intellectual exercise. I had to push myself to complete it.I gave it two stars because of Ballard's use of language (he creates some powerfully repugnant analogies/allegories) and exploration of ideas. However, intellectual exercise, alone, does not a successful novel make for this reader."
4,powerful and graphic,"I bought this book with full knowledge of its controversial subject matter and I was not dissappointed. The book immediately opens with graphic descriptions that made me cringe and hesitate, for a moment, to read on. This is something many do not enjoy. I, however, did enjoy the novel and its graphic nature. I found the book to be slightly confusing though one must take into account the way in which J.G. Ballard wrote it, with a hallucinatory feel. The book itself is a whirlwind of eroticism and violence that caused me to see the link between the two, made so apparent by Ballard, that would have been unrecognizable prior to reading the novel. It was a great read and I fully intend to read more works of this skilled and powerful author."
5,Exceptionally well written and original,"I hesitated a bit before giving this book a try, as the subject matter sounded violent and disturbing. But Ballard does a brilliant job of creating a rich world of desire and eroticism, and the characters become quite real and compelling. The book was a very pleasant surprise, and I recommend to anyone to pick it up with an open mind and go along for the ride"
2,Crash. And burn.,"I read the book. I had no problem with the subject matter. In fact, I was intrigued by it. BUT.. the writing was PAINFUL, repetetive and weak. How many times can you use the words ""Stylized"" and ""Instrument binnacle""? Perhaps the idea was to make to characters and prose as mechanical as the object of their obsession. Maybe. That MAY make it forgiveable. But that doesn't make it good.The 2 stars I gave were STRICTLY for the subject matter. The writing itself was tedious. I think it's been a very long time since I've read a book that BORED me this much. I hated the characters, they were shallow and self-obsessed, and BORING! Any chance of erotic tension was lost because I honestly didn't give a rat's behind if the characters had sex or not. I stuck with the book, because I hoped there was a point. There wasn't."
2,Yaaaaaaawn............,Even though the images in this book disturbed me at times and turned my stomach the plot of this novel was very mudane and boring. The characters were never fully developed and I had no compassion or even interest in their lives. Perhaps with a little more character development and a faster moving pace (the book was very repetitive) it would have been a more worthy read.
2,Not my thing,"I did not like this novel at all. I respect the author's audacity, and I admire his descriptive powers and use of language. Also, the issue of technology and machinery in modern human interactions is an important subject; it's what brought me to the book.The problem is that nothing much happens. I didn't mind the gore or explicit sex; I minded the fact that I didn't care about the characters or the plot. It's a theme-driven novel, and the theme doesn't change or evolve. The descriptions of cars, airplanes, crashes, sexual escapades, drug trips -- they're the same at the start as at the finish. I wanted to grab the author and yell, ""OK, OK, I get it; can we move on now?""The only reason I don't give it 1 star is that Ballard's use of language is great, and his themes are important. But that's all I got out of this novel."
3,Crash provides an eerie sythesis of man and machines,"Crash is a pivotal work in cyberpunk writing... A truly scary representation of how far humans have been devoured by our love of machines. Highly influential, it's spawned reams of philosophy, including commentary from Baudrillard, one of the most important nihilist/philosophers of the next millenium."
2,Lame,This book -despite a provocative concept- is not good. I don't recommend reading it. Ballard's language makes no sense and tries way too hard. If you read the last two pages you'll find out just how unworthwhile -blatently stupid- this work really is.
2,I entirely understand what Ballard was writing about here...,"however, the story just never takes off. The comparisons Ballard draws between the metaphysics of cars and sexual response is slightly engaging, however, it is not engaging enough to carry you over these 220 odd pages. The story is lackluster. I give the book 2 stars for this concept Ballard explores - drawing parallels between cars and the human experience, etc., however I found the book tedious and repetitive. Bloody shame, too, the book came under high praise."
3,"Intelligent, but Boring","It is a work that is beautiful, unique and significant in terms of literary premise, but it it is not grabbing or attaching. It lacks human empathy and sympathy."
1,CRASH - absolute peurile drivel!,"I have read a number of Ballard's works - Hi-Rise and The Drowned World are decent enough. His writing style is dry, mechanical; he's certainly no lyricist. Crash is one of the worst books I have ever read, not because of the 'shocking' content but because it is just BAD! No real plot, reams of description about cars crashes, etc ... in fact the whole book feels as if the same five pages are being endlessly repeated ... I can think of nothing whatsoever to recommend this book."
1,Don't waste my time.,"The book's title would have been better as ""Crap"" As a hugefan of books that shock and offend, I was very excited aboutreading this book. However I was sadly disappointed afterabout 50 pages (I was also bored!). Maybe I'm missingsomething with Ballard's connection between the sexual actand cars, but I don't see any relevance. Ballard is lookingdown his nose at the reader, assuming their stupidity. Thebooks characters are weak and transparent, and the story isfar to meandering to really have any point. I was veryunhappy. And PLEASE, stop using the words ""pubis"" ""chromium""and ""semen"" over and over and over again Mr. Ballard."
5,great item,great price for quality product. i used it as a child guard for the fireplaca and installed 2 hooks and a small piece of decorative chain to each side. it has worked great for 4 years now
3,Works but Smells Gross,"This shampoo was recommended to me by a sales clerk at Whole Foods. I have very itchy scalp and dandruff that other non-medicated shampoos were not helping to alleviate. I wanted something natural and not full of Earth harming chemicals. I have to say that with the first application it worked fantastically. I did not itch and my hair did not come out dry or frizzy. I did end up returning the shampoo because the darned shampoo made my hair smell like truck stop beef jerky, and quite frankly I don't care for beef jerky. I thought the smell would go away once I dried my hair, but it did not. I will admit, though, that the smell wasn't quite as pungent. I'm a city girl, and I don't spend a lot of time in the woods, but the time I have spent in the woods I can honestly say that they did not smell like this horrendous shampoo. So, it works. Just watch out for the smell."
2,Doesn' do a thing,"This shampoo doesn't do a thing, in fact it leaves my hair with even more dandruff. It is very oily and leaves my hair greasy looking. Equates' (Wal Mart) version of selsun blue worked much better and it is by far cheaper. I had used this product many years ago and obtained the same results, NONE. Just goes to prove that traditional, home remedies don't always work out..."
4,Islam Muhammad and the Koran,It gives good insight into the reality of islam hidden beneath all the GOOD vineer from the vantage of a middleeastern. this is valuable in understanding mid eastern culture and why and how islam developed the way it did. It gives good comparisons to the bible and in everyway draws back to the bible. there are a couple of minor misspellings but they are minor as i said according to the valuable information inside
2,RoadPro 12v hair dryer,"I purchased this hair dryer/defroster for the purpose of defrosting in my mobile windshield repair business. I was disappointed due to the fact that it did not get very warm at all and really did not blow very hard. I also believe that if it were used as a hair dryer, it would take a long time to dry hair."
1,My 1st and last Road Pro Product.,My wifes RoadPro 818 died within a month. It started smoking and the switch melted.
1,"Do NOT buy, terrible product","To start things off, the plastic package was half open when I took it out of the shipping box. Then, after the first 5 seconds of the first time using it, smoke started to come out of the back.I got this even after reading the bad reviews because I wasn't going to use it as a hair dryer or defroster. So I didn't care, as long as the thing blew air. But it cant even get that right.Don't waste your money. I'm returning this thing immediately."
2,12 Volt Hair Dryer,"This dryer puts out a small amount of heat, making it not worth the time and trouble to dry my long hair. I think I should have purchased an inverter that allows a more powerful watt dryer instead. If you have short, thin hair I suppose it would be o.k."
1,worthless,I could blow air from my mouth harder than this hairdryer blows....awful. totally worthless. Do not buy or try. It is a total waste
2,Low Volume - Low Heat,"Listen to the other reviewers who complained about this item. They were right on the money, and shame on me for buying anyway."
1,Product did not work properly and clearly had been used!!,"The product I received came in an opened clamshell package indise a shipping box. When I turned it on there was a burning smell and it had very little power. It was also scuffed and did not have a new shiney finish! Clearly it had been used!! Inside the warranty advice was not satisafactory, no number to call and basically a brush off!I have never before has a problem with an Amazon product but this has definitely made me thnk twice about ordering again!I had a number of friends waiting to see if they should order the product and clearly they will not due to my experience!!"
1,Piece of junk,I got this hoping I could dry my very short fine hair while we are in our RV. I could dry it faster using a paper fan. Horrible product.
2,thumbs down,works fine if you have 20-30 minutes to waste defrosting your windshield. only practical use is to warm your hands until the car heater begins to kick in.
1,Pls dont buy,"I bought to use after swiming at pools. But didnt work as expected, its poor than car's ventilation with max hot. Not work for the price..or can't get more out of a 12v heater may be.."
2,Disappointed,This product is advertised as a Hair Dryer/Defroster. It is not even powerful enough to generate any amount of warm air. It does not perform well as a hair dryer and it certainly does not work as a defroster. I would not recommend buying this product.
2,better than nothing!,"very basic auto-plug drier. one switch. one heat. one air speed. does not get too hot and wind not that strong, but if you're camping or in the middle of nowhere, it's certainly better than nothing!"
2,No Heat,My defroster went out and i was looking for something to help defrost the windows and i ran across this. It has no heat. i can hold my hand diretly on it and it wont burn.
4,you wouldn't believe what I'm using it for,"The Roadpro RPSC-818 12V hair dryer serves many purposes for me. Works great to dry your hair on a boat, RV, in a car after a rain. It's very convenient to have with you. It's small style makes it easy to transport. When it warms up it throws off enough heat to do what it's intended to do-dry hair. I also use it to give some heat in my 1952 MG TD replica since the VW engine doesn't have a heat exchanger-ie no heat. The Roadpro is hookedup to my air duct behind the dashboard and i wired it to a remote switch to control it's operation. It throws off enough heat to keep the inside of the car warm. The volume of air pushed is not a lot but given time it does the job. I live in New England and it gets pretty cold. Also it defrosts the windscreen as well. So far so good"
1,12v Hair Dryer,It lacks power it will take ages to defrost anything I'm afraid. I wonder if there is something out there more powerful.
2,Weak.,"As an earlier reviewer mentioned, don't bother with this product if you have longer hair! (Mine is only a few inches long.) Additionally, don't expect it to be useful for styling (with a round brush), it doesn't get hot enough.It did, however, eventually dry my hair. Next time I'll just let my hair air dry like I usually do, though, and save the space in my luggage."
1,Does not work.,Does not work. Why do I have to write 11 more words to complete this review? Why oh why oh why...
5,NGK is the shiznit,I was having Honda generator issues with smooth operation. This plug did the trick and it now runs mint!
3,Honda Generator use,"I got this for my Honda Generator use. After 1 year and less than 2 hours of use the plug didn't work, I mean the generator won't start. After changing to a new plug, the generator start up fast as usual. Not sure what's the problem was. I thought these plugs should give me 100+ hours of use..."
2,Not bad for newcommers to Maya7,"When i received this book in the mail I was excited because Kelly did such a good job with 3D Studio Max Bible. On opening the box i noticed the book seemed cut in half, but it was complete, thinking OK let's see what's in it !.Well it glosses over allot of topics but doesn't go into any detail on any. If you just want to find out what Maya 7 can do and where things are and how to get to them easily, this book will tell you how. There are allot of very simple tutorials to get you started on using Mayas' features, but none that will enspire you to go further.Seems to me that Kelly realy knows his stuff when it comes to 3D Studio Max, but Maya is more of a ""I suppose i will have to do a book on this one too."" task.Don't get me wrong, the book is good, but not to the level of the ""3D Studio Max 7 Bible""."
3,they say ceramic but they are painted,These are awesome hooker headers. Bolted right up to my 70 chevelle. Unfortunetly the discription says Ceramic Coated Headers. They are not! They came to me painted. My mechanic was in a hurry to install my exhaust and need the headers to finish so I kept them. Wish they were Ceramic like the site said they were.
5,We have seen such sights!,"I learned to love Pulp with this compilation, and I think that anyone who's interested in this band should do the same. ""Hits"" is just a perfect compilation, covering the non-Fire period of Pulp, from ""Intro"" to ""We love Life"", and also featuring a new track, which is ironically the only deceiving track of the compilation. This cd is good from the first to the last song and slowly takes you throughout Pulp's wonderfull career, making you (re)discover unforgettable hits such as ""Babies"", ""Lipgloss"", ""Common People"" and ""This is hardcore"". Needless to say there's no fillers here. Weither you're already a Pulp fan or not, I strongly recommend this beautiful retrospective of Pulp's best years, that will make you want to here more and more of this incredible band."
4,Politics of Pre-revolutionary Boston,"John Galvin guides the reader through Boston politics in the fifteen years preceding the Revolution, 1760-1775. Mr. Galvin focuses on the three men he contends were the most influential in the events in Boston in the pre-revolutionary years (Thomas Hutchinson, James Otis, and Samuel Adams).Very readable and a good source of behind-the-scenes activity that led to the beginning of the American Revolution."
3,Caution,"This is not an insertable piece for your inlet. This part is intended to be installed after removing the stock inlet and cap. Unless you grind down the ribs or attach a small hose to squeeze on and into your stock inlet , it won't fit."
3,Decent protection,"This is a good product for protecting your Zen device from bumps and scratches. However, I bought it for the arm band. Sadly, that's the one thing that is severely under-engineered. The silicone material which the sleeve is made out of stretches far too much to be of any value when used with the armband. I've resorted to simply wearing shorts with pockets to the gym and placing my Zen in a pocket.So, to summarize, if you want protection for your Zen, this is great but if you want something to strap it to your arm with then skip this and look for something a bit sturdier."
1,A very limited view,The author seems to have invented a device to make testosterone injections to the penis more effective. He fails to mention less invasive means of delivering testosterone. Nor is Viagra ito be found here.I'm sure there are some for whom penile injections are appropriate but I want information about all the alternatives before I make a decision. This booklet does not provide information on those alternatives.
1,Terrible Unit,"I have had this toaster since January/2012 and the first problem is that it does not toast evenly over the complete surface of the toast. Now starting less then two months ago, the middle setting burns my toast and now it does not pop up and it has almost caught fire."
2,Broken after only 3 months,"The toaster broke after less than three months of use. The handle would not stay at the lower position, so we had to hold it there for two or three minutes to toast our bread. We will contact Hamilton Beach, but this kind of defect is unacceptable."
2,Stopped working less than a year old,"We really loved the look of it and it did the job (albeit slower than our 20+ year old not-so-pretty toaster), but in its last months alive, the spring that keeps the food in the toaster stopped working and you had to hold it down continuously. Then it just stopped working all together. At that time we had bought three different items made by Hamilton Beach and each one malfunctioned much earlier than even a ""cheaper"" product would. You are much better off paying less for a different brand unless you are cool with having to replace everything regularly. HB just doesn't make things to last.In general many products nowadays are made to not last as long as they used to (we actually bought two of this toaster with that in mind; the second one is already starting to show the spring issue). But with the amount of money you have to pay for this product you would think it would have lasted long enough to get some value out of it. You are better off buying a $15 toaster."
2,Worst Packaging Ever,"This is a good product. It makes my hair feel fuller, manageable, and healthy. BUT, It has the worst packaging ever. The container is very smooth, and hard to hold onto in the shower. The lid is also slick and difficult to turn with wet hands. It says not to get water in the product. I have difficulty, however, getting this slick lid off, dipping one hand into it, applying to hair, and somehow keeping the conditioner from falling off my head while I attempt to twist the slick lid onto the slick container with my now wet and conditioner covered hand while in the shower. The first time, I dropped the smooth, wet container onto the shower floor and lost half the product. There is no reason this could not be in a tube or other squeeze type container. It's not so thick that it wouldn't work. The packaging engineers at P & G should be severely chastised for this obviously poor design. I'll not be buying again, unless they change the packaging."
2,Cost of Software $50,Cost of MS SQLServer 2k5 Software: $50Cost of tech support to install MS SQLServer 2k5 on my new MS Vista laptop: $99.Success after 1 month: None.
2,Vista Trouble,SQL Server was a pain to install and get up and running on Vista. The updates required were huge and very time consuming.
2,Does not work with Vista,"I bought this product so I can get training in SQLI have a brand new Vista system from Dell, and it will not install, I get error messages that seem to show it is looking for a Network Server account, and this program is designed to be installed on a normal PC for development, so this should not happen."
4,THE Relational Database Software`,"SQL Server 2005 is pretty much the Microsoft standard for server based relational databases. I bought this product in conjunction with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 standard edition, and they are a good pair. If you are planning on doing any Windows Forms based programming, or web programming that requires relational databases then I recommend this product for testing on your own servers during development work.MySQL and similar are often used for third party web hosts; if you can do SQL with this server software, then you can probably do it with MySQL. This software, however, is for more enterprise level software and web design, and if you are a beginner, then sticking to MySQL is probably your best option.If you are new completely to relational databases, using Microsoft Access or similar can help you get familiar with the table, key, and relationship structure. Server side databases often times aren't as visual and can hamper learning for beginners."
5,For DIY's as well!,"Yes, I do work on my ""German"" vehicles; nothing wrong with it! This coverall is excellent quality, versatile and a must if you want to look good under your car. Keeps you protected and clean. A must for DIY's."
4,"Environmental Marketing-Strategies, Theory, Research and pra","Aunque no ofrece una perspectiva global de lo que significa el marketing ecológico, este libro recoge algunos de los artículos académicos más relevantes en materia ambiental. Muy recomendable para aquellos lectores que buscan una visión de la materia objetiva, cientifica y avalada con investigaciones sólidas. Para el lector que busque un libro práctico, con casos empresariales, probablemente esta no sea la lectura más adecuada."
4,Good summer read,"Dr. Laura Donaldson is a cancer researcher looking for the elusive cure for cancer, when she happens upon information and evidence of a death row inmate who seems to have an immune system that just eats up cancer cells. David Haines is the death row inmate with the super immune system along with a fanatical religious belief that will not allow him to give his blood. He's on death row for killing numerous doctors. Dr. Laura Donaldson's attempts to acquire a sample of his blood through legal means backfires when Haines makes a somewhat predictable escape from prison. Kevin Sheldrake, the FBI agent who captured Haines the first time, is on the case again. Can they capture him alive?With a gritty edge of suspense and a little background on cancer and cults, this makes for some entertaining summer reading. You'll see the depths reached by religious fanaticism and the fervor of a scientist with a goal. The ending was left open for a sequel and, to me, a little disappointing.Recommended."
5,It''s in the Blood,"Psychotic killer David Haines is on death row, awaiting execution, when cancer researcher Laura Donaldson (whose own daughter has cancer) sees a video of a blood sample taken from Haines only days before his execution. To her amazement his T-cells are fighting and destroying cancer cells. Haines may be carrying the cure for cancer in his blood. But he doesn''t care and he''s not interested in giving any of the precious stuff away. He thinks it''s ungodly. Besides, he hates doctors and has tried to kill as many of them as he could before his capture.This is a five star book full of thrills and chills you won''t want to put down."
4,"Terrific mix of suspense & drama, medicine, crime & religion","For those readers interested in the likes of Robin Cook, Iris Johansen, and Patricia Cornwell, Kenneth Oppel's ""The Devil's Cure"" will be a nice treat.A medical researcher, Dr. Laura Donaldson, studying treatment for cancer becomes involved in a search for an escaped religious nut who is set to be executed for murdering doctors.The plot is interesting, the characters, convincing, and unlike far too many popular books in this genre, the writing is skilled. If you are a fan of medical science combined with criminal investigation, I recommend checking this book out."
4,"Not Your Average ""Electronic"" Band","Way back in 1990 I was a techno dj and I blindly bought a record called ""O'Locco"" by Sun Electric. It turned out to be one of my most favorite plays...it was just a bunch of different iterations of ""O'Locco"" all blended together and the entire thing was sheer bliss to listen to.""Beauty O'Locco"" doesn't approach the brilliance of the original, but it's still quite good. The entire album is quite good. At times it gets a groove going and you suddenly find yourself bobbing your head and saying ""oh yeah."" Other times it's just purely hypnotic.Kitchen is a thoroughly satisfying excursion into the more intellectual realms of electronic music. If you even remotely enjoy this type of music, you'll love the album."
3,Back to Future- Is Classical Education the Answer?,"This is a book that seeks to present a broad overview of the classical Christian model of education.Today's America's schools are in a mess. Violence and drug-usage at schools are no longer news. Learning to read and write gives people the tools to ask and answer questions in life. But our schools fail miserably in this basic task.Douglas Wilson is strongly against government schools. He argues that all these happened because we falsely believe that schools can be neutral about morality. He says that education is basically religious. Education deals with the basic questions if life, and these questions demand religious answers. He proposed that we must turn to Christian classic education- in styles, philosophies, even curriculums, with an emphasis on the children development.Has Wilson gone too far? It is your call. However, he will convince you that education is not the world's savior. Education itself needs to be saved!"
5,Great Devotional,"Finally, a book for teenagers that is actually about things teenagers deal with. I highly recommend this read for any teenager looking to improve their daily quiet time."
2,Comfort COLORS?,"The book should be entitled ""1000 shades of beige"". I bought the book to learn how to bring some color into my home.This is certainly not the book for those that are trying to develop some color courage."
3,"Works fine, but no mounting screws",An easy fix for a very smelly problem. I would have given it more stars if it had the mounting hardware it said was included and that was shown in the photo. I had to scrabble around to find four nuts and bolts of the sort of right size since the ones on the old valve had corroded and broke when I removed them. Don't leave it till the last minute to fit this valve when all the hardware stores are closed and you're going on a camping trip the next day as I did...
4,Easy to replace.,The item was received in good condition and was easily replaced on the sewer line of the trailer. No more leaks!!
3,It works,"Seems I reviewed the wrong product here a while back, so I'll remedy that. This gate valve was easy to replace and works well."
2,Poor product quality,"These are supposed to have prohold tips.However, the smaller ones either had just a hole in the tip or a poorly injected bristle like element of plastic. This is no BONDHUS quality."
2,Handles too small,I had heard that these were a nice wrench set for a good price. I tried them out and found the handles on the smaller hex wrenches were too small to get a good grip. I tried them on a few different screws and couldn't even get the screw all the way in. I have a cheap set of ball end wrenches that I tried on the same screws and I had no problem. Not a good feel to the small handles at all.
4,great coverage of the Confederate's last big invasion,"Season of Fire proves to be a well written and well researched book on Confederacy's last effort to do something meaningful by trying to attacked Washington DC. Led by General Jubal Early, the Confederate forces came pretty close to success and the authors were correct in saying that even if the occupation of Union capitol would only be momentary, the political and morale cost would be devastating for the north. While hindsight make this campaign almost a sideshow, the book revealed how close it really was to being a main event."
1,Boring characters for whom I had no sympathy; poor dialog.,"Did anyone really say:""He was out of line. He used a racial epithet""(p. 179). The characters are very up-to-date (ecology guru, aids victim, homosexuals), but are stereotypes, not real people. This novel could have been successful with more work."
3,"Not Lurie's Best, But Still A Fun Read","Alison Lurie makes novel-writing look easy. And while that is not necessarily a good thing, this book makes enjoyable reading for a lazy Saturday. Lurie has a lot of insight into character, and she can paint a good picture of academics, writers, artists, and affiliated hangers on. She's also really funny in an understated sort of way.One thing I noticed in this novel that I haven't noticed in Lurie's previous novels is her use of clothing to reveal character--hardly surprising for the author of a really good book on the culture of clothing!Another thing to watch for in this and other Lurie book is references to her other novels. Lurie has Stephen King's habit--or he has hers--of placing sly little references to previous novels or having characters in one novel be connected somehow to characters in another novel."
4,Grown up fiction,"I bought this book, having read lurie before, in order to escape all sense of trend or fashion. it is exhausting having to read in order to hold forth. lurie, i knew, would take me in to the real world, away from the sunday papers and the chatterati. and i was right, she did. a lovely book, this, for grown ups."
4,sheer elegance and entertainment between two covers,Alison Lurie takes us on a journey of gentle discovery of humanity and its shortfalls.Everybody falls in their own way as we view inside each characters' mind as they meander on the brink of life and death on this far away island that is a perfect vignette setting for each of their story. A perfectly charming read and immensly enjoyable.
1,"Zero stars; slow, dull and insipid","I have been an Alison Lurie fan for 20+ years and have enjoyed all her other books. I eagerly bought this one in light of my past good experiences and have never been so disappointed. This is not a finished work; it is a rough outline of a plot with cardboard characters, no motiviation, dull description, etc. that neither the author nor her editors cared enough about to turn into a finished work. It is also surprisingly poorly written; Lurie is usually a fine stylist. But, really, what is one to make of sentences like ""'Okay,' Lee answered repressively."" (see p. 221). These words are not only awkward and graceless, but also totally devoid of meaning. Skip this one; read War Between the Tates, Foreign Affairs -- or anything else."
2,Missing: Last 100 pages,"Although I read through this book rather quickly, I kept hoping for more of a sense of ""closure"" for all the characters. Wilkie and Jenny Walker, and a number of others, were meant to be sympathetic characters, but they somehow lacked the warmth I needed to feel this way. Not enough information was given about them to make me in touch with them. Lurie would present little tidbits of information and just when I thought I would learn something intimate, another character would be introduced, leaving previous descriptions simply floating. It was distracting and at times confusing. I expected more from Lurie, who has an established reputation. As my review title explains, it seems as if the last hundred pages are missing. Just as the characters are reaching the turning points in their lives, the book ends. There is no denouement. A climax, but no release."
2,still searching,Lurie's latest is an interesting distraction but I have yet to read anything by her that tops Foreign Affairs or The War Between the Tates. I may have to look into her earlier works. In the Last Resort she sets up a lush Key West scene. Too bad the characters aren't as flushed out. The end left me dangling. This work seemed unfinished.
5,Excellent drive at a great price!! Easy to install.Perfect!!,"This was the first ever Internal CD-RW drive I bought.It was great.This drive is of nice quality with a great price and is very easy to install.Once I installed It into my PC then hooked everything back up,when I turned my Pc back on It was instant.Windows XP automatically reconized and installed the drive and gave It a designation letter.I was burning my own cd-rs in no time.And as If things could'nt get any better,This drive comes with The excellent full version of the Nero 5.5 burning software.Perfect for all your burning needs."
1,Poor Tech Support,"I purchased a drive from Cendyne in March. It quit on me in July. I have yet to be able to obtain technical support or replacement. You sit on hold for 10 to 20 minutes, then their voicemail asks you to leave a message. When they do call back it is usually the next day when you're not there. They don't respond very well to their internal user support system, either. I don't recommend anyone purchase a drive from Cendyne.By the way, their CD-RW is very fussy about what disks it will use, and none of the name brands is on their acceptable list."
1,"Support, what support?","Had problem with the software installing. E mailed support listed in the installation and troubleshoooting guide. Waited 3 days and was provided with a contactus.asp link that brought me to the ""amazon.com"" page for cendyne drives. Seems to work, but have no ""WIzard"" or ""Ahead"" in the programs. Support my ........"
5,CenDyne (Lite-On) 32x12x40,"I bought this product around Easter and love it. It is so fast!Installation is a breeze and if you've ever worked with Nero, you know it's a great software product for burning or copying CD's. This CD-RW also works great with WinXP's built in software for copying files to CDRW discs. I've use 2X CDRWs and 10X CDRWs and WinXP recognizes the different speeds and writes VERY fast to the 10X (I have yet to find 12X CDRW at my local stores). I also have used 32X CD-Rs and they work great (and fast) too. This is a great product for the money."
4,My two cents,"I was surprised by all the negative feedback on the book. I really liked it. I know it's not pure, pure, GSD, but dogs are dogs, you're going to run into some overlap.I wish I had bought the book, before I got my dog, but it was still helpful none the less. I got my GSD from German Shepherd Rescue. The book talks about like programs as well as breeders.If you're thinking about getting a GSD, I'd recommend the book."
5,The best!!!,This is the most useful and user friendly of all the GSD books I have in my library! It has a lot of information none of the other books have.
4,Helpful book,We have only just begun to dig into the information in this book. We love how it does not try to fancy up the language. The book keeps the information simple. Dumbs it down! :)
2,If You Haven't read any other books may be you will like.,"Well, for a start this has all the details that anyone would write about GSDs. Nothing unique in details. Not sure if the author is expert on THE GSDs. Having read few other books, I found this is not much unless this is your first book, if this is your first book then you will definitely be encouraged to read more about GSDs - thats the only good point as far as i can see."
5,All the basics,This is a great basic training guide for a first time or long time GSD owner. I highly recomend it!
3,"Hell, Fire, and Brimstone","I am well aware that owning a pet of any kind is a HUGE responsibility, I don't need it shoved down my throat every other paragraph. Furthermore, the author had a grim way of reinforcing the fact that neglected Shepherds would indeed be problematic...well, duh! Sardonic predictions and lack luster descriptions of this beautiful animal made me doubt if indeed the author had ever actually owned a German Shepherd.That being said, if there are individuals out there that don't know that a dog of any kind is a huge undertaking, this wouldn't be such a bad read."
2,Terrible German Shepherd book!,"This book is good if you want general advice about dogs. However, if you want to know specific details about the breed then your out of luck. For example, the book doesn't cover taping the ears AT ALL. Which is odd since it's a book about German Shepherds."
3,Agree with other reviewers,"I've had this book for two years now and agree with many other reviewers. While the information in the book is helpful in a general sense, the cover picture and title could be changed and it could apply to any dog breed. Really nothing specific about German Shepherds."
3,Pretty Basic Book,"This was a pretty basic dog training book and not necessarily targeted for GSDs. I understand that you can't categorize dog behavior by breed, but lets be realistic-GSD's are naturally protective and territorial. I wish that this book would have gotten into this a little more.I did appreciate the information on the hip issues."
5,no damp basement,"this dehumidifier is a little louder than expected, but quieter than many other brands, very nice unit"
5,asking for trouble,"brilliant book, it was the first book i have actually read from cover to cover. from his childhood to his escape from the troubled country of south africa it kept me in the book and was very interesting"
5,My Girlfreid bought this and loves it!,She says it's huge and has a TON of deffinitions. She's going into Social work so she says she will need it mostly when she first gets started.
4,"Adorable Costume, Runs a Little Long","We ordered this costume for our son's first Halloween. He wore it when he was 10 months old. It was incredibly cute on, and we received more than a few 'adorable baby' comments.The fabric is pretty light weight, a kind of one sided flannel. Our son, at 10 months, was in the 95th percentile for height--and the costume was a bit long for him, but not uncomfortably or unattractively so. The feet are big (as can be seen in the photo), but our son wore his tennis shoes underneath and was able to toddle around about as well as could be expected for a brand new walker.The item consists of 3 pieces-the body (Velcros in back), the headpiece (Velcros under the chin) and the lily pad. The seller we purchased from did not mention that the lily pad has a little sound button that, when pushed, makes a 'ribbit ribbit' sound.Overall, a cute costume."
2,smudged costume,"I recently bought this for my son, and it arrived today. Once I opened the package I found a large dark smudge on the chest of the frog suit. It's not extremely noticeable unless you are close up, but it's very disappointing to pull something out of a package and have it already soiled. I am afraid to try to wash off the mark since the felt is very flimsy and already can be seen through if you so much as stretch it, so I guess he will just go to the party sort of dirty."
2,Eden: nice. TTSG single songs: that's a different story.,"This is a compilation of ""Eden,"" Sarah's blockbuster album from last year, and all four songs from the 1997 single ""Time To Say Goodbye."" The songs from ""Eden"" are good. I have that CD. However, I caught a glimpse of the TTSG single, and I was totally disappointed at what I saw: three of the four songs (""Sleep Tight,"" ""You Take My Breath Away,"" and the intimate version of the song ""Time To Say Goodbye"") are all Sarah's recordings, even though she AND Andrea were featured on the front cover of the single together. For shame, Ms. Brightman, FOR SHAME!"
5,Suzy Q from toronto,"I read ""Chasing the Truth"" in just 2 days, I especially like it when a book grabs me from the beginning as this one did. If I get thru 1 chapter and I'm not hooked, then I tend to put the book aside and never finish. This grabbed me and kept my interest. Story and flow are what's important. It had just enough mystery, action and intrigue.Reminded me of a Grisham novel. I thought it was terrific,and I'm going to watch for his 2nd book."
5,THE BEST! THE BEST! THE BEST!,"Having lived in and around Philadelphia my whole life, I can easily say that TastyKakes are a Philly tradition that is unsurpassed. I don't think there is such a thing as a bad Tastykake variety, but everyone has their favorites. For me, the Kreamies were always my number one favorite since I was a kid. The Lemon Pie, TastyKlair and Coconut Junior are next in line. For some reason though, it's getting tough to find Kreamies everywhere which is disappointing. I was thrilled to see that they were being sold on Amazon. They're still the best Tastykakes in my opinion, and I highly recommend them to anyone who has never tried them but loves chocolate cake."
5,Top Notch Dean Koontz,"This is a review of George Guidall's recent audiobook of this older Koontz (Paige) book. While I'm not generally speaking a Guidall fan, he definitely outdid himself with this book. A commanding performance, and raised my opinion of his ability.The story presents one with the question, how could anyone for any sane reason do this to a 3 year old girl - ANY girl - especially their own daughter. The lesson taught is don't mess with mother nature, she bites back. This definitely one of Koont's best efforts. I find that I only like a few of DK's books - e.g. Odd Thomas trilogy, Sole Survivor, Watchers - this book quickly became one of my favorites. While the main police character was sort of mundane, Guidall's reading added much humor to the conversation and kept the story from bogging down at times. This is a definite must for any DK fan and especially for George Guidall fans."
4,The Invisible Enemy,"That's strange - a number of rather unpleasant people seem to be dropping dead, of highly unnatural causes. Their assailant leaves no fingerprints. Or footprints. Or eyewitness descriptions. He - uh, ""appears"" to be invisible. And there's no locked room he can't get in. Dear me - what can the matter be?Astute readers will figure out most of what's happening, early in the piece. It doesn't matter. It's a fun, wild ride, anyway. Koontz has played with this theme before, but he handles it best in The Door to December.For what it's worth, I know people who haven't read any Koontz but this, or this and one or two others, and each of them have mentioned to me how much they love this book. I do, too."
4,can'tthinkofanything,"In true Dean Koontz fashion, non-stop twists, action, unexpected turnsand great characters! Mr Koontznever (well almost never) disappoints."
3,Always enjoy Koontz,Even though many of his story lines seem familiar I always enjoy reading this authors books. Although farfetched I hang in there til the end.
2,NOT HIS BEST WORK!!!,KOONTZ is one of my favorite authors...this book may have been my least favorite of his.I had pretty much guessed the outcome before the end of the book--but I wish it could've had more of a follow through with what happens in the aftermath. I guess I like everything tied up in a bow at the end.I really would not recommend this book--especially if you have never read Koontz because it will leave a bad taste of a VERY good author!!!!Try another Koontz book---avoid this one.
4,This one is one of his more scarier novels ...,"but still not one of his best. Read ""Intensity, Hideaway, and Lightning"" and do the comparison yourself."
3,Good but I've read better from Koontz,"""Very satisfactory,"" as my high school Phys. Ed teacher used to say. The characters are well drawn and appealing. My only complaint was that I knew the ending after the first few chapter. In other words, I found the story quite predictable. However, the interaction between the characters kept me interested."
2,Mind Candy,I found the book a good bedtime read where you don't need to think very hard to see where the plot is going but it was full of flaws that needed overlooking.
3,Too Predictable,"I love Dean Koontz and have read over 20 of his novels and I was disappointed by December. It was very predicatble and at the end I thought to myself, I knew this was goign to happen 300 pages ago. If you can't figure the ending out early on, you must be very unaware. Skip this one and choose something, anything, else."
5,The best and most suspenseful book I have ever read,"WOW!!!! This book was incredible. The plot was eery, intelligent and original. It had great twists and the climax was mind-blowing. You can't stop reading from the first page and you can't put this down until you are done. A great story and this is a good book if you want to read Dean Koontz. A great read! YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not Koontz's best,"I liked this book, although I felt it was way too long for the type of story it was. It had a lot of different characters, more than neccesary i believe. I liked ""A voice in the night"" much better. And one more thing, if your not interested in the supernatural and poltergeists this is definately not the book to read."
5,One of the best,"This is the 3rd DK book I have read, and by far the best!! The story keeps you going till the end."
5,One of the best Koontz books i've read.,"I can say, as a good reader of Koontz, that this book was as good as Watchers in a different way. I admit it might have ended more affectively but I loved it. I read it in Turkish 5-6 years ago and I'm looking forward to the day I'll read it in English."
2,it dragged!,the author dragggggged this story way too long.....too many minute things mentioned instead of just getting to the point.
4,A Plausible Approach to the Paranormal,"I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. I am very critical of Dean Koontz because he has written the best fiction book I have ever read, (""Intensity"") while also being the author of other books that I found severely lacking in quality plot or plausibility.You may read the other reviews to get the synopsis of the story, but I am writing this review because I am so pleased with this book. Koontz tackles difficult topics such as teleportation and telekinesis. I say ""difficult"" in that it would be hard to write a plausible story with that subject matter. But Koontz pulls it off in ""The Door to December"" suprisingly well. The book is well-paced and the descriptions are vivid without being overkill. Your heart will ache for this little girl and her mother. I actually cried a few times during the story. This is one of Koontz's better novels."
5,suspense-packed from beginning to end!!!!!!,"this is one of his greatest books ever! I always love reading Dean Koontz's book, they simply keep me awake! And shake the hell out of me! Awesome! I recommend 6 stars, though:)"
1,My least favorite Dean Koontz book to date.,"I was very disappointed with this book. DK is my favorite author and this book was recommended to me as a ""must read"". However, I felt it drudged on and on and I had to force myself to keep reading to the end. It really just bored me and I could not get into the characters or the story. Not recommended. For a good DK read try Intensity, Midnight or Hideaway."
5,Dark Paths,"This book takes you into the darkest recesses of the human mind. It takes you to the depths of a mother's love and a father's obsession with science and psychiatry. This is the first novel I ever read by Koontz and by far one of his best novels ever. If you love Koontz, you'll adore this book, even if you've never read him, if you enjoy the strange and obscure this is the book for you....Read and enjoy!"
2,Just another opinion...a total snore!,"Wow! I was actually glad to read all the positive reviews of this book, because obviously it has some redeeming value. For me, however, this book was a big disappointment. I figured out what was going on as soon as the toaster started jumping around...and was bored ever since. If you have read or seen Stephen King's Firestarter, you will feel that you have seen all this before. I started skipping large parts of the book after I had gotten two thirds of the way through. Sorry folks but...I beg to differ!"
3,"Strong start, but weak ending...","The story was gripping in the beginning and really grabbed my attention, but got weak halfway into the book. The ending was particularly lacking and predictable, in fact, quite laughable, like starting out with an original masterpiece, but ended up as a poor reproduction."
3,get what you pay for,"nothing was exceptional. they were just helpful but nothing was a five star item. that's what happens when you buy online,you don't know what you're getting."
3,"Same Koontz, different words.","Dean Koontz always has great plot lines, but for me, his style is too repetitive. Every book has at least one golden retriever. And his story lines bounce from one extreme to the other. On one page it'll be 'He loved her to a depth and breadthhe never imagined his soul could experience.' On the next, he's describing a pistol grip shotgun, how many shells it holds, and why the hero chose it over an uzi. It's like a Harlequin Romance written by Charlton Heston. While I'm sure Koontz doesn't care what I think, there it is."
5,so great i hope they make a movie of it,i usually do not read science fiction but i could not put this book down. all i could think of after i finished with it is i hope they make it into a movie . this book also needs a sequell.
2,A very average Koontz book,"I've read many of Koontz's books over the years, and was disappointed by this one. I don't know how ANY of the readers here could say it is great, or ""the best."" I'm a big Stephen King fan, and have enjoyed many of Koontz's books in the past, really liked Odd Thomas, and some of his older books, like Phantoms, Whispers, Strangers, Whispers, and The Bad Place. This was barely worth the read. I will continue to peruse Amazon for reviews of his better books, so wish me luck. I'd hate to give up on Koontz entirely."
3,Great but predictable,"I have to agree with some of the comments already posted. This was a really great book, full of drama, and it really gets you involved with the characters, but the outcome was predictable from early on. I would still recomend this book though. Its a great story about the love of a mother for her daughter, and the length she is willing to go for her."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a fan of Dean Koontz, but this is definitely not one of his better works. The dialogue is artificial and hokey, and I actually found myself rolling my eyes during Dan's conversations with his colleagues. The story was predictable and slow. I usually pass good books on to friends and family, but I am not recommending this one to anyone I know. Don't give up on Dean Koontz if this is the first book you've read by him. Read The Bad Place, it is absolutely fascinating. Also recommended: Midnight and Lightning. I guess you can't win them all. Pass this one up and read his other books instead."
3,Is Dean Koontz Really Two People?,"I have always wondered whether Dean Koontz is actually a whole number of people who merely use the name to sell the books. I have always found that his work varies considerably with regard to a number of factors. It is difficult to understand how the genius that inspired 'Watchers' and 'Phantoms' can also be responsible for some of the other stinkers that seem to have been written by him. I always approach a Dean Koontz book with a little trepidation. Needless to say, I was impressed with this one. I figured out the story pretty early on but there really was some joy in waiting for the characters to figure it out for themselves. The characters were rather two-dimensional but they were able to evoke some sympathy and Koontz took one of his staple characters - the tormented child - and actually made me care for her a little."
5,One of my favorites by Koontz,"Suspenseful. Speaks to the lengths that a mother will go to in order to protect her child, even from the unnatural."
4,DTD review,"Overall, a pleasant and entertaining read. Character development is a strength of Koontz. This book does not disappoint in that regard. The characters come to life throughout the book. The story line was completely predictable."
3,A good book,"Worth the read. This was not my favorite Koontz novel, but definately worth the time. I would recommend it to fans of this genre."
4,Door to December by Dean Koontz,"It was a good story, but not quite as good as most of his work because I was able to guess the ending too near the beginning of the story. I really love SURPRISE endings.However, I continued to read it because, despite that one flaw, he told the story well. This book contains a lot of suspense and I recommend it for others to read."
2,Not one of his best works,"The basic concept of the mother finding her daughter after six years, only blocks from her home and under unusual circumstances had me intrigued...at first. Then it is the usual boy meets girl and they fight the good fight together to go on to build a life together. In between is the typical surreal settings that Koontz is synonymous with in most of his books. I had this one figured out after about 100 pages and was disappointed to find out I was right. Read it if you must but there are better books in this genre."
2,There are better reads...,"As a Dean Koontz fan, I must admit that I was rather dissappointed by this book. It was way too long, and although I usually find myself tearing through the pages of his books, I muddled along through this one. Before you read this, read Lightning and The House of Thunder. These are Koontz at his best."
1,Very depressing ...,"I can't even get into this novel because it is so dark. Also, it just fails to grab and hold like so many of Dean Koontz' books. It has a creepy air about it with all the abuse and swearing. Give me something that's more exciting and in better taste."
3,Koontz can't leave himself alone...,"...he has this irresistable urge/desire to tinker with his past books. To polish and update. The Door to December, a thriller about a traumatized child's outbursts of psychic rage suffers from that syndrome. Although the setting, clothing, and political views are clearly recognizable in parts as the seventies, Koontz stuffs in 'contemporary' references to keep the novel 'current'. It doesn't work. The story is good enough to be left alone, as it should have been in the first place. Recommended for Koontz buffs."
1,Yukkk! Please don't think this is really Dean Koontz,"The Door to December is the newest Koontz audio book in my local library system and I thought it would be up up his usual standards. Was I mistaken! Creepy but not mysterious should be an oxymoron but that describes this book. Child abuse and S&M; does not really make for entertainment, even in Koontz's hands. I felt depressed after finishing this book because there seemed no hope for the characters nor purpose to the story except for a generalized fear of the government.After Odd Thomas, The Face, Watchers, and other Koontz wonders, I was beyond disappointed. This book was originally published in 1985 under another name and I can only hope the author has left this junk behind. Thank goodness for George Guidell. He made listening bearable. I probably would not have finished a text version.Please Dean, even Steven King learned not to torture kids.(See Cujo.)"
4,Door to December,"Very well written, suspenseful, could not put my kindle down!, felt as if something would jump out of the page and grab me at times, all characters were very well described!"
3,Very Dark Story,"I read this story a very long time ago and it is a very dark story and very depressing because of the major long term sensory deprivation the little girl was kept it. It was an extremely cruel experiment that greatly damaged her physically, spiritually, and emotionally. It is a good thingthis was all fictional. I got a pretty cold feeling reading this book and was glad to put it down. I cant imagine spending years in darkness with no human contact and nothing to see or hear or smell. Fans of Dean Koonz probably will like it because he writes good suspense novels. I no longer read Stephen King or Dean Koonz novels cause they just plumb scare me! The movies are scary too, if well directed."
3,Not Dean's best,"This book, along with"" Strangers"", is one of the very few Koontz books I found not fascinating. It gets stuck with the lurid details of torturing a young girl. The morbidity is not unusual for Dean, but it usually is a sideshow to his great characterization and plotting. Couldn't get through this one with others begging to be read."
2,A fan of Dean but not this book.,"Like all Kootz novels this book is readable. The totally predictable outcome and excessive length make the overall experience much more boring than the average Koontz book. I have not read all of DKs books but of the fifteen or so I have finished I would rate this effort as tied for last place ( I also thought Demon Seed was a waste of my time).I still plan to read all of DKs books. When he is good, he is very good. Even when he is bad I think he rates two stars for some snappy dialog and decent (though brief) characterization."
1,Substandard,"I love Dean Koontz. But totally disliked this book. It was too pushed. What was happening was more than obvious since the very beginning of the book. The writer should know his fans better - most of us warmed up to the truth long, long before the grand revelation at the end of the book.Also not a fan of George Guidall. He narrates terribly. I can hear him licking his chops, and he sounds weird, sighs in strange places, his women voice is way weird, he disconnects me from the story, instead of drawing me closer. Total disappointment.Just listened to the Frankenstein series, last few narrated by Christopher Lane - loved it, both the story and the voice. This book - substandard. Save your money."
5,Another Great CD!,"If you are a fan of Willy Deville you will not be disappointed with this CD.If I was forced to pick a favorite song on this CD it would be,""Crow Jane Alley"".I think I stumbled onto what it is that is so darn wonderful about this amazing artist and that is this: When Willy sings he is wholly present in the moment of that song.I think that is why the listener feels as if he is singing directly to you."
5,Broken Trail Alan Geoffrion,Read novel after viewing mini-series film and thoroughly enjoyed both. Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church embodied essence of book characters in their performances. Vendor sent large-print book which I had not expected and did not catch in product description.
1,"Very disappoint, like great panda with frown.","In my rush to exude all things Pocky, I get rid of them with sparkle way and come to this. I get with haste of sumo and think that this instill in me the anger of 10,000 lions. I think it anger, anger tablets but it come to find out and realized by me here that it not at all that way at all. It only candy for little childrens. It no make anger, anger, but only causes teeths to become stuck together like glue from on high mountains. Avoid this now, rightly."
3,OK... not great,"I was attracted to this book because of its theme of Purple Martin enthusiasts, but was disappointed. By the end of the book it seemed clear to me that Auch has an ax to grind with public schools. I believe that the issue of Grady not fitting in at schools he attended could have been handled with a little more grace and been much more effective. Instead, public schools are put in the role of whipping boy to explain Grady's problem.The book does do a decent job of explaining the special needs of Purple Martins as a species, and the large role played by humans in their survival. In addition, the storyline of a single mom down on her luck raising a challenging adolescent will be very familiar and all too real to most people."
2,too idealistic,"Corporate governance is almost a term of oxymoron..can searching for profit be able to contain the behaviors of the few greeds? or could profit searching be able to interact with the change of corporate executives since whether it is public or private, a company is still governed by a few executives which constantly cannot be controlled by BOD...Corporate governance is very difficult to reach because people change and often there are change of people's role within the company even the company's mission is originally to set out for the goodness...but very difficult to do."
4,"continues to contribute to ""best practice"" with children","Even though this book is somewhat dated, it provides valuable information on assessment. Most of the information will always be useful. It continues to be a useful tool alongside more recent texts. It is very easy to read and very practical in its orientation. Will always remain a classic in the literature on child psych and assessment."
5,"Powerful, still useful...",I used this as a text in graduate school and I still refer to it on a regular basis in my clinical practice! A must for anyone interested in psychological assessment of children.
3,Psychological interplay.,"Extremities gives a look into the depraved psyche of perpetrator and of defendant alike, in conflict mode.The tables turn on a would-be womanizer. The woman(ized) must decide what to do with the criminal. How far should she take justice? Will she risk her own criminality? Her friends temper her reason a little..Talk is the main structure of the plot. Violence is rationalized by some of the characters, but could be construed as gratuitous.Personally I was intrigued, on some lower level. The conflict takes place at the extremities of the characters' prepackaged morés.Includes black and white photos from a New York performance of the play which starredSusan Sarandon as MarjorieJames Russo as RaulEllen Barkin as TerryDeborah Hedwall as Patriciaphotos (c) James Hamilton 1982, play (c) William Mastrosimone 1978 ."
3,World Reference atlas,I bought the book on sale at Borders too. While it does have lots of interesting facts the maps can be hard to read and it is very difficult to read the names of rivers. Also state capitals are not clearly indicated.
4,Fabulous for $14.99,"I just bought this book at borders today on sale. It is a fascinating book that is teeming with facts and stats. I do have one issue though, the color schemes used to indicate facts and areas, are very similarly colored, making maps not very friendly on the eyes. Since this book is 14.5 (in) x 11 (in) and easily 15 pounds, I would not recommend buying this book online since s/h is going to be hefty, and all sellers love pad ""handling"" costs."
2,Not what was expected,"This DVD has been a disappointment. I purchased this DVD for my father as a gift. He grew up with the comic books and the movie is not what we expected.First of all I expected a DVD in the native language of Spanish ""Argentina"", or at least the option of Spanish sound track. Who is going to view this beautiful memory in English?The DVD does not have a menu optionThe name of the horse is not fosforito. It is ""Pamperito""It has no way to identify the character that the actress Norma Aleandro portrays. (No credit given as to the voices)Great Idea but a great disappointment."
5,Excellent Reading,I must say the previous 7 reviews say it all. The story isvery well written. All I can say is keep it up Timm. Waiting for more.
5,YOU MUST READ,"UNTIL......IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK...ONE YOU MUST READ....IT IS ONE THAT WILL REACH YOU. THE CHARACTERS ARE SO REAL THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE THAT HAS GONE THROUGH THIS,BE IT YOURSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE...I FOUND IT TO BE SO INTERESTING THAT I FINISHED READING IN ONE DAY....I DIDNT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN...I TOLD MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS BOOK..AND THEY ALL WENT OUT AN PURCHASE THEIR COPY...AND ENJOYED IT SO MUCH ,THAT THEY TRIED TO FIND MORE MATERIAL ON THIS AUTHOR....DONT JUST TAKE MY WORD...GET YOUR COPY AND SEE FOR YOURSELF..."
4,Pyle Home PT610 Amp/mixer with 70V output.....,Bought the PT610 amp to replace an amp in our buildings PA system. Works great and the price was very good.
4,Be Careful of the Cherry Clafoutis!,"My daughter and I made the Cherry Clafoutis recipe on pg. 17I thought it was a little strange that there was no flour in the recipe...it baked into a custard and didn't turn ""puffy and golden"" as described. I then researched Clafoutis recipes and they all had flour in them...I'm not quite sure how much to add. Maybe 2/3 cup?Could the author let us know?Thanks for a great book and bon appetit!Lynda & Reilly"
5,Help,"I didn't read the book but I do have a question about a mobile home? I know someone who needs to move a mobile home to Kentucky from Michigan about 340 miles, but I can't find movers to do that. Can you help me find a list of movers so I can call for bids or have them call my friends dad at 517-434-5710. His name is Wesely McDavid. The problem they say that they are not license in those states. Thank you if you can help."
2,Nice but old,"Perkinson is competent and caring, structured and paced. But it's a bit old, as if all CD treatment was unadulterated Minnesota Model, 28 day inpatient care. Now , in fact, more than 1/2 of those facilities have died on the vine due to managed care, and outpatient rules. Plus we've got patient placement criteria, all kinds of research from Project MATCH and etc., and new techniques like motivational enhancement, stages of change. Maybe if Perkinson put out a second edition and updated it, we'd find it more useful"
5,Chemical Dependency Counseling: A Practical Guide,"This is an excellent, book on the science and art of counseling. Highly recomended. My clinical advisor in my graduate school placement recommended it to me."
2,Difficult to install. Better brands out there.,I had one originally installed by contractor. Lasted only 4 years. Went to replace with same model. Connection ports updated and now face downward making it difficult to access to place the wires. I finally gave up and bought a Honeywell model. Much easier to install. Don't recommend this product.
5,white rogers prog themo 1f78-151,"A little difficult to attach all wires. Easier if you leave box hanging, rather than attaching to wall first. Easy to program. Product works great."
4,Programmable thermostat does the job,"Just finished installing my new White-Rodgers programmable thermostat. It does everything it was advertised to do. Easy to program, easy to install, and easy to read. Some thermostats show when it is calling for heat or the AC. This one does not. The display alternates between the time and the room temperature. This can be annoying as some have a bigger display showing both simultaneously. All in all, for the price, you cannot go wrong. Let's hope it gives me many years of maintenance free service."
5,Back to the Future,"This was a great book I could not put it down. It made me think of what it would be like to go back to the Old West from the 21st Century.Trey and Amanda's reactions to their different worlds keeps the story moving right along.I like to read historical romances and this is one of the best.It makes me want to look for a white horse to show up in my yard. I would highly recommend this book it is a good light summer read,one that helps you to escape from the real world for a while. I give this book 5 stars."
4,Very comprehensive view of old art techniques,"I found this book to be a very fascinating how-to manual. A lot of the terms, however, would have been lost on me if were not for my Making of Art Supplies class. This is definitely not a book for the beginner to pick up and start making art supplies. Very useful for the Renaissance Faire attendee looking for a way to polish up an artist character."
4,very useful,"This is useful book, although not a beautiful one. I will use it for recipes to do things the ""old way"" maybe as the masters did."
3,"After reading this,one can truly appreciate some of the perks of being an artist in 21 century...","When you open this little book you are in for a shock. Or, shall I say - a jolt back to a reality show from a florentine painting workshop circa 1400?It is a completely unrefined(even quite raw to some tastes)step by step manual on the nitty-gritty of paint and medium preparation which can generally attract two types of readers - the professional painter who has heard of this little collection(and its mysterious ""painting secrets"") from word of mouth; or else, the seeker of bizzare and obscure literature of times past - in both cases you will go through this book alternating between bouts of disbelief and hysterical laughter...Great entertainment, and perhaps even a thing or two to learn about how renaissance artists saw themselves and their work."
2,"10k White Gold Journey Circle Pendant (1/2 cttw, H-I Color, I3 Clarity)",Cheap quality and it shows in the clarity of the diamonds or rather the lack therof. The old adage is right> You get what you pay for.
1,We returned it,I have always been 100% satisified with Amazon but this item was low quality and we returned it. My first bad review for a product from this nearly perfect online shopping site.Diamonds very low quality and just looked like it came out of a gum ball machine.Amazon gladly refunded money and paid to ship it back.
2,Good For a TZ Fan's Coffee Table,"This is a highly interesting book, which also includes the script to the episode ""Eye of the Beholder"". Stills from the original TZ are included and captions include lines from the episodes. However, the stills are of very poor quality and this works against the tolerance of the reader. It was published in 1990, five or so years before computer screen-capture devices were developed, and before the internet emerged. A creative little book, but 10 years ex post facto, it's no more than mildly interesting. If you're a TZ fan, buy a used copy and put it on your coffee table, like I did."
2,"Wanted gardening, got a cookbook","To me this book was a disappointment. I had hoped for in-depth gardening information. This book has very basic tomato gardening information. The majority of the book is devoted to tomato recipes. So if you are looking for a cookbook that gives LOTS of tomato recipes, this may be the one for you. If you want detailed gardening information and troubleshooting, this is not the book."
4,Everything you've always wanted to know about the tomatoe...but were afraid to ask!,"This book is an excellent primer for the novice and an interesting read for the accomplished gardener. Over the years I've bought several copies for friends particularly when I learn that their anxious to begin a foray into the wonderful world of garden-fresh tomatoes.I am prompted to write this review as I just had an email from a friend thanking me profusely. I had given her and her husband a copy of this book last spring, they read it and followed the advice for growing and ""putty by"" tomatoes and, at the completion of their first year, they are ecstatic to have many jars of canned tomatoes lining the pantry shelf...as well as a whole freezer full of frozen summer sunshine to last them through the winter.The book is interesting, informative and accurate. If you are interested in tomatoes you can't go wrong with this one."
5,My favorite book,Double Luck is the best book I've ever read. I loved Chi Fa. He was so brave. I want all my friends to read this book.
1,Ripped the skin off.,"I bought this as a replacement for an old Remington soft and silky because I could no longer find a replacement head for it. This was highly rated so I bought it. The first time I used it, I just as well have used a dull blade. I used it dry because that's what I want it for and it was awful. I couldn't shave my legs for days until they healed up. I tried again and got the same. It might work better if used it wet with shaving gel or something but I don't want that. It is useless to me. Now I'm looking for an adequate replacement for my old Remington 5000 which still works, by the way, but is getting a little dull so it takes me longer to shave."
1,Going back to my Remington - what was Panasonic thinking?!?,"I wanted to like this and I bought it at a local store but:1. Charger design is pitiful! It's a block that plugs straight into the base of the razor and from there to the outlet. It is beyond impractical. If charging is a pain, a rechargable unit is useless.2. The blades are a lot narrower than my Remington WDF-3600 (which also has a cord to charge). I have had it for years and I a buying a replacement head and blades for it to renew it instead.Bottom line, it's going back and although not perfect, I am going back to my Remington!"
1,Useless,"I don't think I ever got one decent shave with this razor. Wet or dry it is far from a close shave! I bought it mostly for dry shaving and easy clean up. I don't know if mine was defective or what, but it felt like it just pulled my hair instead of cut it. I tried going over areas several times and never felt satisfied with the result. I didn't buy this razor to go over areas over and over again... It's time consuming and uncomfortable; worse than using a disposable razor. Defeats the purpose of buying an electric razor."
1,Horrible,This razor requires you to go over the same area multiple times; as a consequence it takes a long time to shave. I have used electric shavers for years and this is by far the worst one I have ever used. Remington is much better in my opinion. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Horrible Razor!,I bought this after reading the reviews and was hoping to get a decent razor. It is horrible. Doesn't work well wet or dry. And....I have tried using it with my hair being different lengths (wanting to make sure that it had grown out enough and other times not too much). It never really worked. Even right after shaving my legs were NOT smooth. They felt like it had been about a day or so since shaving with a regular razor. How disappointing. Even the bikini area groomer wasn't all that great. You're better off paying more and getting a men's Panasonic razor instead.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this because I thought it would be an improvement to the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018A32XS/ref=oss_product electric razor that I usually purchase. Unfortunately, the razor completely stopped working within less than a month. While it did work, I found that it did not shave as closely as it would appear to, and my skin was often left chafed."
3,OK performance,"This shaver works so so. But I have never used other electric shavers before, so I have nothing to compare with. The cut is not too close. The skin still feels rough afterwards. I use it in the shower. The mainternance is easy. It is easy to clean. I expected better performance from Panasonic than this though. I kept it anyway because I won't cut myself with it."
1,waste of $$,This shaver does not get a close shave. It scrapes your legs up. Waste of money. Get a remington instead.
1,Panasonic Wet/ Dry Ladies Shaver,"I have been a prime member for quite a while now and I shop at Amazon a lot but this is the first time I wrote a review. I was disappointed when I got the Shaver yesterday, the box was already open. It looked like it had been cut open at the bottom with a pair of scissors. I did not expect Amazon to send me an open box when it says in the description it's new. I dislike the hassle of returning and reordering stuff, thus, I did not bother to return it."
3,good but it doesn't shave well and sometimes it injure,good but it doesn't shave well and sometimes it injure specially when when the battery lowthe good part it's very fast when the battery is full
5,Great first experience with a razor,I bought this for my daughter when she was 10 and ready to start shaving. It is the perfect razor for her and her sister. I recommend it to everyone!
4,Going green,"I bought this after a great deal of research. We are working towards going green, and decided that I would switch to an electric razor in an attempt to save the landfill space (and our cash) from all of those disposable razors. It works pretty good, not as close as the other method, but close enough that you can't see anything. Also I have been using this in the shower and find that it takes a great deal longer to shave with this than it did the other way, although from what I hear, once you are used to it, it actually takes less time."
2,Not a good basic shaver,"At 62, my shaving needs are basic, so I have nothing to say about the bikini features, for obvious reasons. I don't particularly care to shave in the shower either. All I want in a shaver is for it to work well for my armpits and legs. I have sensitive skin, so I took a chance on this shaver; it's my first Panasonic, and my last.The reason this gets two stars instead of one is that it does do a good job on my legs, and the shaver holds a charge well, for several shaves. That said, my primary concern is shaving my armpits without irritation, which it does, and without having to keep going over the same area to catch all the hairs, which it doesn't. You would think that with the rotating head that this contour feature would help, but this shaver will not give you a close shave under your arms without several passes. I don't even have thick hair, so if you do, I certainly wouldn't recommend this shaver."
2,Worked great for 1 month & now it's dead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I first received this shaver, it worked great! I have it one month & now it won't charge any more. I was extremely careful with it & only charged it when the charge was gone, and never over-charged it. Now, I can't get it to charge at all any more. I'm very disappointed with this shaver - worked great for one month & then died! I would not buy this type of item from Amazon again either, because they don't even know how much of my money they will be refunding. They can't promise me a full refund because it's been over 30 days since I placed my order, even though the shaver is now useless!! Lesson learned here!"
4,Panasonic Ladies Shaver,"My husband got me this razor as a replacement for the Panasonic ladies razor I had for ten years. In the interim Panasonic has made some improvements on the razor. For instance, the head is larger which I liked but for some reason the edges on the razor's head are noticeable when you shave. I didn't care for the head's swivel mode either for the same reason. The one thing that really improved is it does shave leg hairs easier and closer. It also has the easy clean up and is great in the shower."
5,"Awesome, especially for the price!","Really great razor! This is a great razor for everyday use. It doesn't get as close of a shave as a regular blade razor, but it gets close enough for me! I love the attached bikini trimmer, too. Very good buy, especially for the price."
4,"Convenient, great for travel","Like all electric shavers I've ever tried, this is not going to shave as closely as a standard razor. That said, I think this product is great for quick and convenient shaves out of the shower. I was also impressed with the battery life. I took this on a 14 day vacation and was worried because I forgot the charger. Turns out I didn't have to worry - it lasted the entire time!"
2,Disappointing,"I was rather disappointed with this electric shaver. I found that it does not shave as closely or as evenly as previous electric shavers I've used. I noticed that regardless of the angle I held the shaver at, the left side of the shaver would always work better than the right, making it so that I had to repeat the area multiple times. Also, the blades seem to go dull very quickly- afte about a month and a half of moderate use! After that time, the shaver kept pulling the hair instead of shaving it, leading to an unpleasant experience and numerous bumps and redspots. The one advantage to this shaver is the wet/dry function which is very useful for using in the shower. Overall, I would say that this is an okay shaver for the price, but if you can afford it, get a slightly more expensive and higher quality shaver that will shave evenly."
5,better than any i've had before,"i gave it a 5 star because it works great, beeter than others tried. the price was good . i always read other peoples reviews before buying and it has worked out great."
2,Did not perform well,bought it for my wife and she wasn't happy with the performance of the product. Used it a couple of times then went back to her old razor.
2,Poor product for the job :(,"I have this trimmer and it just does not to the job well for the bikini area. It trims in some areas and then in other areas, it leaves the hairs long. The aesthetics of the trimmer is pretty, but don't expect your bikini-lined hairs to be the same length because some will be long while others will be nearly gone."
1,boo,"unfortunately, this item never worked properly even though I kept trying. I eventually just threw it away. would not recommend this item to anyone"
1,disappointing,We bought this for our daughter to begin learning how to shave. It wouldn't even shave her fine hair. It was extremely disappointing. I definitely would not recommend this item. It was a waste of money.
2,Don't Like,"On the first day that I used this thing, I couldn't get the pop up trimmer to stay in place - it finally broke. No worries I thought, I don't need it. A few months later....oops....it fell in the shower but did continue to work. Went to use it again recently and now it is DEAD! I won't buy this one again. I didn't like it since day one. The one positive thing about it though, is that it did stay charged for a decent period of time."
4,Like this shaver,"I do like this shaver, however, I still feel a razor shaves closer. But I recently had 3 surgeries and could not reach down to shave my legs in the shower, so I use this shaver on my legs and it does well but not as well as a razor. However, I would recommend this to anyone who can't use a razor due to any reason. It does not pinch or hurt in anyway and does shave close enough but you'd have to re-shave in 2 days or so depending how fast your leg hair grows."
2,Not that great,"I bought this product hoping to use it for a long time. Unfortunately, it stopped working well after 3 uses. The shaver would slide across the skin but all the hair would still be intact. I am not sure what the problem is, but if the blades get blunt after just 3 shaves, then I would not recommend this product."
3,It's OK,"I bought this shaver a while ago, and I hardly use it. I bought it to use on my legs and bikini area. I liked that it could be used in the shower, but the battery does not hold a charge for too long - I have to keep it on the charger constantly. It also does not shave as closely as I would like on my legs, but I do like the bikini attachment. I still use it here and there, but it's not my first choice for hair removal."
5,Great shaver for the price,"This shaver is better than the more expensive one I used to have. It gives a pretty close shave without leaving my skin irritated or feeling ""scraped"". Of course it doesn't shave as close as a blade, but none of them do. If you want perfect silky smoothness, stick to razors. (and cuts and nicks and bumps...) The adjustable pivot on this one is great, it really hugs the curves nicely. Overall, it's a great little shaver, and I'd recommend it."
2,It functioned normally for one year and one month.,"I've been using an electric razor for over ten years. My first one lasted about 6 years, the second one about two years before I had to replace the screen and head and instead of replacing the head for the second time, I purchased this razor. Mistake. Last month it started pulling leg hairs but didn't remove them."
3,It's Okay,"It doesn't shave as close as I want, but it's better than all the razor blade cuts. Haven't tried any other brand."
2,Product Didn't Last,"For the first few months of use this electric shaver worked fine. It needed a few passes to really trim the hair on my legs, but I have found that to be the case with all electric shavers I have used.However, after a couple months it began to not cut very cleanly, and then began to snag and pull out hairs painfully. I treated the shaver gently, stored it in a dry place and cleaned it carefully once a month. I don't know if the product just gives out after a short period, if I got a lemon or if there was some user-error on my part, but I am displeased with my purchase and I wouldn't buy this model again.Another point of note about the product is that the charger plugs directly into the wall, so keep that in mind. I couldn't plug it in the outlet in my bathroom because the outlet is immediately below my medicine cabinet. It was nice to have it up and out of the way for charging in the outlet that I did plug it into, though."
1,"Weak Dull Blades, bad trimmer","I ordered this shaver as an upgrade. I have bought the ""Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver"" 3 times in the past (they die about once every 18 months) and thought this would be better and was only a few bucks more. But I was wrong. The trimmer is difficult to push up and down, hair clogs in the trimmer and is impossible to get out. The other blades are pretty useless because the pivoting head makes it difficult to create any pressure for a close shave. It doesn't keep its charge either. This is the first out of hundreds of products I've bought on Amazon that I am unsatisfied with. Unfortunately they won't let me return it either. What a waste of $30, Amazon customer service is usually great, but this has been a disappointing experience to say the least."
1,PanaJunk X 2!!!,"This Shaver works great for about a month! Then, it dies and will not turn on. This is the second one that quit in a months time."
2,Close-less,"If you have course hair, this shaver will probably not benefit you. You have to put pressure in order to get somewhat of a close shave."
5,Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry,I've been using this product for about a month now in the dry mode and love it. My old one of 25 years finally died & I had to replace it. The Panasonic is very quiet compared to the old one and does a good job of shaving. I like the pivot head as it provides a smoother flow.
5,Very Happy,"I bought this for a blind friend with sensitive skin and diabetes and she is very happy with the product and said that is was easy to set up and is performing well. She keeps the razor on the charger that plugs into the wall.One word of caution about the charger, which is a 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch block that plugs into the wall: the blades of the charger plug are vertical blades on the left and right below the socket for the razor device charger plug. If you have wall plugs with horizontal blade holes on the top and bottom, the charger will need an extension of some sort, or one will end up charging razor on it's side (which I imagine is extremely hard to do).The Amazon price was excellent and I appreciated the super saver shipping.Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve"
3,Scratchy shave,"This shaver does a reasonable job of removing hair. However, it feels like it is scratching my legs. It doesn't actually break the skin, but it does leave white streaks that last for several minutes after shaving. I much preferred my old shaver, which never scratched."
2,Didn't last long.,"I was new to electric women's razors, and chose this one because it was relatively inexpensive. I really wanted it to use outside of the shower, for quick ""leg"" shaves. As a few other reviewers have mentioned, I had to go over several spots on my legs continuously. Sometimes, I had just had to give up and go back to my disposable razor/shaving cream. I'd only had it a few months when it started to give out. The ""push out"" feature, allowing a closer shave for certain spots gave out first. No matter how many times I cleaned the thing out, it just never worked as well as it did the first few times I used it. I was getting nicks/pulls and finally I tossed it. I'd considered calling the ""parts"" number, but after reading several reviews about never getting any replacements for it, I gave up."
3,Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Ladies shaver,"Wife says it does a good job, but is somewhat tedious to clean, due to the ""articulating"" head.More serious of an issue is the ""recharge"" docking device. Two things noted: One, the unit does nothave a power cord; it has two prongs that need to be slipped directly into a wall socket, or,if desired, plugged into an extension cord. The combined weight of both the shaver and the recharger is such thatit takes a very tight fitting wall socket to keep the unit plugged in. Her previous unit had a counter-top rechargeunit with a short cord allowing it to be set on the vanity while being plugged into the wall. The second issue, is the fit of theshaver into the recharge unit is such that it requires ""fiddling"" to set it in place--especially if the unit is plugged into the wall while trying to reinsert the shaver. In short, Panasonic needs to redesign the charger base."
3,"Not great, but ok.",This shaver is not great but it's ok when you don't have a lot of time. I like that you can use it in the shower. It's also easy to travel with.
2,Barely good enough for winter,"This razor is not as good as I expected. I wish my 25-year-old corded ""R"" brand razor hadn't died. This one does not shave very close at all. And it feels rough, like I'm shaving with sand paper. I was able to shave 3 times on one charge. I could never use this if I plan to wear shorts. A little disappointing. (I have only used it dry.)"
1,Does not work!!!!!,I am a big one on reading reviews and after this shaver received 4 stars I decided to buy one for myself. What a waste of money. All it does is leave your skin red and irritated. I hope you would look for a better shaver given the price of this one.
5,good shave,"i've had this shaver 6 months, just now replacing the blades. it is almost as good as a blade, but is easier to use. you can even use it in the car, if you can shave without looking.i haven't used it in the shower, but i experience no irritation under arms or bikini area."
3,Didn't last long,I purchased this razor for my young daughter. She barely used it in the winter and about every 3 days in the spring/summer due to having super fine hair on her legs (lucky!). This razor lasted about 1.5 years with that light use. The other problem my daughter had with it was that the on switch was very difficult to slide. The razor did do a good job for her when it was working though.
3,princess,This shaver has long battery life and shaves fairly close to a traditional razor.I like to be environmentally friendly and choose electric shaver for last 25 years.
2,scratches my legs,I picked this one cause of the good reviews. It does a good job shaving if you press hard. I don't recommend shaving before a shower cause the cutter things on the edge scratch really hard resulting in sensitive skin so it stings in the shower.
4,Great alternative!,"I am thoroughly impressed with the Panasonic Wed/Dry shaver. Underarm and bikini shaving is super close without causing razorburn, easy for beach days that I just need a touch-up. Ideally, the reason I purchased this is that the cost of blades for Venus and Gilette shavers has skyrocketed, and even shopping at Costco anymore has become super pricey for replacement blades. When I want a fabulous shave for my legs, I'll still use the Mach 5, but for everyday shaving, I like this product for it's versatility in and out of the shower.One star deduction for the awkward plug/charger along with the battery life. It certainly does not last for 12 days on one charge, so I suppose if that expectation were lowered, I would not have been disappointed. Would purchase again!"
1,Won't hold a charge,Very disappointed.....After a minute of use it loses power and the blades slow down pulling on the hair instead of cutting it. I need to replace it with a better product. Waste of $30.00
1,Product cost Vs. Charger cost,"I bought this product 3 months back; took it to India, my wife used it for few days and then charger (adaptor) got out. I thought of buying a new charger but guess what.. the adaptor cost is around 31 USD (on pansonic offical website). Ah! too expensive when compared with the full product cost.I was expecting it to work on 50/60 Hz frequency and on 220-240V voltage but I believ, it is not made to work under those cases, though I don't think it was written explicity anywhere.May be designed to work only in US; but still... adaptors might go out even in US also."
3,Item Review,"Great service. Although we did not need the item and returned, the service was great and we were refunded for the product very quickly."
2,Not so clean,Not really worth the money. I got a cleaner and faster shave from using non-electric things like mach3 or tracer razors.
4,it does what its supposed to do!,"i was skeptical when i bought this product, but when i tried it i was amazed at how well it works. not only does it work well but it is very easy to clean. the charger is not bulky at all so it fits easily into luggage. it was worth the buy."
4,Review of Panasonic Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver,Shaver works fine - not as close as I would like when doing underarms. I haven't tried the bikini attachment yet. Is adequate for the money. Next time might spring for a more expensive one. Works better wet with shaving cream than dry.
2,Don't waste your time,"I was excited to try this product because blade razors usually give me razor bumps. This product worked great for the first two times but on my third use it started pinching my skin, grabbing and pulling the hair on my bikini line... if i wanted my hair pulled out i would get waxed... extremely painful. It also doesn't hold the charge for a long time. The swivel head seems like a great idea but it doesn't work well, such a waste of time and money because i plan to put it in the garbage."
2,My Wife Loved it,"Shopped womens razors till I dropped. My wife loved it, first timeit gave her a great shave. She/I would definitely recommend it.Unfortunately the battery in this razor died in a little over a year,"
5,OMG! Ladies this is IT.,"So, I jumped on this a couple days before Christmas. A little gift from me to me and it was well worth it. I use it in the shower with a bit of shower gel and it is great. Good for in between waxing as well as on it's own. This works great everywhere, yes even the bikini area! Do not hesitate to get this, I'm glad I didn't."
4,Shaving Happy,I've been very happy with my Panasonic Close Curves Shaver. Its comfortable to hold making it easy to use as well as convenient being cordless. I have a nice close shave when finished without all the nicks.
2,Not a close shave,"I am disappointed with this shaver. I bought it based on the other reviews, but I have tried it wet and dry and it is does not give a close shave."
1,Bad design leaves scratch marks,"I was completely unimpressed with this shaver. Perhaps I received a defective one, but it scratched my legs all up. The design on the shaver part is a bad one (right next to the bikini trimmer pop-up portion). It made the edges of the shaver scratch my legs as I attempted to shave. This is the worst shaver I've ever used - and I've been using electric shavers for about 15 years. I sent it right on back to Amazon. I have to say I was extremely impressed with Amazon though - they fully refunded my money, even including what I paid to ship it back to them."
2,Panasonic Ladies Shaver ES2208,"This razor worked well for only a few months and then suddenly stopped. On August 1, 2007, I mailed the razor in it's original carton, with sales receipt, to the service address indicated in the product paperwork. Only after an inquiry, I got a reply stating they were ""waiting for parts."" Four months later I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THE REPAIRED RAZOR OR HEARD FROM PANASONIC AGAIN.Therefore, I would NEVER buy another razor from that company."
3,"Great for awhile, but...","I've owned this shaver for about six months. I bought it originally to save money on replacement blades, save water and also produce less waste. I'm a really low maintenance type girl, so I thought this would suit me fine, and it did for the first 5 months. Now that the blades are worn, the razor refuses to cut all the hair on my legs even after multiple passes. The replacement blades are about $20 and foils another $10. A whole new razor is $40. It only holds enough charge for one shaving (legs, bikini, and underarm) and although that's not a big problem, I do have to keep up the pace or it tends to sound like it's about to die and the shave gets REALLY crappy. SO....do I spend $30 after 6 months (I think I'm not saving much money vs. disposables) to replace the blades and foil, chuck the whole thing in a landfill and buy a whole new one for $40 (this does not save any waste) or go back to regular razors?? Sounds like a lose/lose situation to me."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I have very sensitive skin and razors irritate me, I bought this Panasonic because I had seen several reviews as being very good and the price was very good. However once I used it found that it pulls the hair, it does not cut them and it irritates my skin more then a razor, I had used a Remington shaver for years but it was time to replace and I did not want to spend $90 on it. BIG MISTAKE I SHOULD Have!"
3,Not as good as razors I've owned before,"Overall I am pretty disappointed with this razor. I find this product occasionally pulls the hair, and it takes multiple passes to remove the hair in an area; even then I feel like I still need to shave. I have owned wet/dry shavers in the past that shaved comparably to a regular razor, but this does not. There is no way I can use this and still feel comfortable wearing a skirt or shorts in public."
4,Panasonic ES2216PC ladies shaver,"replaced an older Panasonic ladies shaver that I had had for 20 years, but should have replaced sooner. Good shaver, much quieter then the other one was. As someone else has pointed out the plastic tabs that holds the blades are raised up more than the blades are. This can cause red lines on your legs. I usually use it on the bikini line and underarms only so not really a problem for me. I use mine in the shower daily."
4,"as promised, thus far","I haven't used the product often enough or owned it long enough yet, but, thus far, it has provided a good, close shave, and i have no complaints. it arrived a day early."
2,Disappointing performance,"I ordered this shaver based on the excellent reviews, and to switch from a Remington that didn't shave very closely. What a disappointment. I like the shape, but it leaves very long stubble, not smooth at all. The on/off buttons and head are really cheap plastic. The blades did not last very long, and the replacement blades and foil cost more than buying a new shaver. I will be buying a different brand intead of refilling, probably back to Remington."
5,Great Product,"I've use this product several times now and am extremely happy with it. It gives a close shave, easy to handle, and great in the shower. Set back on the recharger when done. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, nice looking, and effective shaver."
4,panasonic ladies wet dry shaver,"For the price this is a good razor. I have had others that gave a closer shave but paid much more. Do not find the bikini attachment works, but I did not buy it for this purpose."
2,panasonic hair puller,Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies actually pulls the hairs as much as cuts. Wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money!!
2,"Value and close shave, but failed in less than 6 months","Although this product is value priced delivers a very close shave, it broke in less than 6 months. I only used it about twice weekly. The trimmer wouldn't slide out anymore, and was loosely held in a partially extended position. I was able to continue use for a short time like that, but then it started tearing my skin. Also, the charge held nicely when I first got it, but after a few months didn't perform as well.This was actually my second try at this product -- the foil on the first one broke. I assume the break occurred while I was cleaning it or reattaching the head, although I am surprised since I feel like I handled the product reasonably. Since I did like the close shave, I decided to order another and handle it extra gently.Since it was the trimmer that broke on the second, it was certainly not my fault.Both shavers wound up in the trash too quickly. Not worth it.I would not recommend this product."
1,JUNK!!,"First one lasted 5 months - just quit working. Traded it in for a replacement, and that one did the same thing - don't waste your money!"
3,Battery has very short life span,"I really like this product, but the one downside is the battery only lasts about 45 days. I've been using this shaver as a disposable every month and a half. The battery just kaputs and slows waaaaaaaayyyy down, and then it takes 45 minutes just to do your lower legs.But it works great. No nicks, and you can do it dry.Just be aware that the batteries are crappy, and not replaceable on this model."
4,I Love it!,I love having the freedom of using it wet/dry to shave. Especially on those days when I forgot and need a quick shave. It is a high quality product for a great price. I really like it!
1,NoGood4Me,I'd like to review it but I can't use it! I wrongly assumed that as it was sent to Australia It would be Auto Voltage 100-240. End of Story!
3,not so hot,"Bought shaver for my daughter (16) for Christmas, found it at bottom of cabinet today (6 weeks later)."
5,Best Electric Shaver I've ever owned,"Many people purchase an electric razor expecting it to shave as close as a standard razor and that's not realistic. However, this one comes pretty close. The fact that I wear glasses and can't see in the shower well enough to shave close, and that I have an uncomfortable shower for shaving, forces me to look at alternatives. This shaver works great for touching up areas I missed and I often use it in place of my standard rasor just because it's more comfortable to shave sitting down!"
5,excellent razor,This razor shaves great. I have very senitive skin and this razor was perfect. The head pivots so it reaches all parts of the leg. I would recommend this razor to other people.
1,Want a close shave? This isn't it!,"This is the first electric shaver that I've ever used. While I like the look and feel of the product, it is useless to give a close shave. I have tried it wet, wet with shaving cream and dry, and none of the methods I have used have produced a shave anywhere near my manual throw-away razor. I have sensitive skin so decided on the electric razor as opposed to an epilator as I understand they can be rough on your skin. At this point I think I'll put this shaver in the next garage sale and go back to my throw-away razor!"
1,Service sucks!,"This shaver broke after less than one year's use. I called the ""service"" department, and they expect me to pay for shipping to repair/replace. If it breaks one year into a two-year warranty, already not a good sign. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Any company that will not pay for shipping when their product breaks within warranty period is NOT a company you should do business with."
2,"Great at first, but slows down over time until it's ineffective","In the first few weeks, I loved this shaver. However as it got older it shaved more slowly until it barely worked (=pulled hair painfully) after a few months. So, short term this is five stars but long term it's one."
2,Awful,No use after 2 months. The blade is spining and not cutting. Also the blades cannot go back in when you take it out to clean
2,DEFINITELY BETTER RAZORS OUT THERE,"I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a manual razor due to constant razor burns, etc. I went on a hunt for a good razor, hoping that I could find one that would give me a close shave.Well, this isn't it. You would assume that the pivoting head on this razor would be a GOOD thing. But it isn't. It does ""okay"", but just isn't what I was looking for.I do want to say that the Panasonic ES2207P razor, which seems to be this exact same razor WITHOUT the pivoting head, gives a shave that feels exactly like I have used a manual razor.Ladies, if you are looking for a good, close shave out of an electric razor, don't buy this one...get the cheaper one without the pivoting head. You won't regret it!!"
1,Dissapointing,"This is a second one of these that I got. First one was June 2011, then this one in December 2011. On both of them, the trimmer is starting to pull hairs. With the first I thought it was my fault, by letting my guy shave his face with it a couple of times before it started pulling. But this time, he has not touched it and it's pulling hairs again just 4 months in. And I do not see a way to replace a trimmer. I am definitely not getting a 3rd one from them. On to find something else it seems."
2,WIfe disapponted - I know Panasonic can make better products than this!,"Looking forward to Panasonic creating the same quality razor for women as they do for men.This 'top of the line' electric razor was encased in plastic and hard to open. The materials used in the razor itself unfortunately matched that lack of quality. Cutting heads were rudimentary and did not provide a close or even shave. My wife is going back to a blade not because she loves it, but at least it works as an effective tool."
2,shaver,"Does not shave closely. When used on pubic hair, ended up looking like a poor dog hair cut. Too large. Old one worked better."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I had high hopes for this product,it didn't live up to them. I was hoping for something that I could use quickly in the morning, but it takes more time then they regular razor. It also doesn't shave very well. I find all kinds of spots that get missed. I've tried it with and without the shaving cream. Neither way seems to work better. I use it once in a while to shave, just so I feel that I get some of my moneys worth out of it."
2,Please read this and try to get a better product,"I like the overall design, mostly the pivoting head, but I think the engine or system is not as powerful as it should be, to get the job done, I have to run it up or down several, several times and it does not give a close shave, so i have to finish it with another device. I've had this one for 6 months, but not to long ago, I bought another one, the ""Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal shaver"" and I think that is more effective than the panasonic. Oh.. another thing that I didn't like about the panasonic is that while I was shaving, I could feel how is pulling the hair out, so that's not fun when you have sensitive skin and after that some irritation follows."
4,Reliable,"I bought this as a replacement for my other Panasonic that broke and died, and I have had it for 16 months now. The battery life is better than my last one, and it works well. The trimmer attachment works so-so, hence 4 stars instead of 5 - it will snag on longer hair when ""trimming"" bikini areas, etc. And only does an iffy job on landscaping. *ahem* But on legs and underarms - it works great."
3,Great for the Pits...Not so much for the Legs,"I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a traditional razor without serious razor burn no matter what brand of razor, type of blade, variety of shaving cream, etc. So i had been using my husband's norelco electric razor. Finally he got sick of me using his and told me to get my own. :p This one had good reviews on Consumer Reports, so I went for it.It does a spectacular job on my pits. No nicks or cuts, no discomfort and it does a great job of getting the hair.I have not had as much success with my legs. I prefer to shave dry with electrics so that's what I tried first. No matter how many times I went over the hair, I still had stubble. I had better luck when i tried it in the shower with shaving cream, but it was still just so-so.Was tempted to return it, but I don't think my pits have ever been so happy, so I'm keeping it."
5,Nice Improvements!,"I bought this shaver to replace my old Panasonic; the battery would no longer hold a charge. Not bad for over 15 years! This new razor has wonderful improvements such as a floating head and charge station right at the outlet (it's also pink, love it!). It works great. I would definately refer this razor to a friend."
3,Could be better,"The pivoting head can be annoying. At times it feels like it is not doing a good job although it does shave well. I had a previous panasonic and when I lost the rechargeable battery I decided to ""upgrade"" to this model."
1,Did not work,This did not work so I had to return it. It pulled a lot and did not cut close enough. It hurt and left too many hairs.
4,PM shave review,The shaver runs smoothly and does not irritate my skin. It has a nice long reach and is easy to hold.
2,Panasonic ES2216PC,This razor works great. I really liked it.I bought one for myself and two more for gifts. Too bad the charger was poorly designed. The reason for the low rating is how it charges the razor.It will not stay on the charger. I tried every way you could think of to keep it on the charger. Still would not stay connected.
4,I like it,"I've only had the razor two weeks so, time will tell on battery life, etc., but I like the razor. It does legs and underarms comfortably. And, I have been using it on that facial ""peach fuzz"" women of a certain age get. Very comfortable, no irritation! We'll see how long the blades stay sharp but replacements appear to be available. The switches are stiff at this point and a little diffiuclt to use in the shower."
2,Dead after 3 months,This shaver wouldn't charge anymore after three months. We followed the instructions about charging and it still didn't last. Called Panasonic and they said there was nothing they could do about it. Girl on the phone was kinda rude as well. It worked well when it was working...
5,"Great buy for price, works better than expected","this was an impluse purchase, and I'm so glad I bought it! It holds a charge for a long time with regular use. the attachments are very useful, love that the head has some give and moves a bit. Got a trim as wanted and shave as needed. Surprised and very pleased, love it!"
4,Great Shaver,Bought this because the reviews stated it was a good shaver. Recommend shaver. It does what it describes in the specifications.
5,Great product,"My wife loves this product. It does everything she wants, she loves the wet/dry functionality, and the battery lasts for a long time. This is a great purchase."
1,waste of money,Right out of the box did not cut just grabed hair very pain full. Will never buy this product ever again.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this razor one year ago. I used it properly, charged it when needed, then it died on me last week. With the other reviews I trusted it would last longer than a year. It worked okay, not as good as a dry razor I use (bikini area), but again I'm just disappointed that it died. These things should give you more than a year!"
3,Terrible as a trimmer!,"As a shaver, I suppose this is as good as you can get with an electric. I still prefer the old fashioned razor blade and shaving gel method for the closest shave. Recently, I tried out the bikini trimmer attachment, and it completely tore my bikini area apart. I bled all over the place. So, as a close shaver, it's alright, but use extreme caution if you're going to use it as a trimmer. It might be alright for others, as I have extremely sensitive skin... but I definitely won't be using it that way again."
3,What you expect,I can't say it is the best or the worst... I use it all the time and I get what I expect out of an electric razor. Of course it is no where near as close as a razor and you still have a slight stubble but if you are in a hurry and just dont want to look like a cave woman it works well!!! I DO NOT recommend this for the bikini line!!!! It ripped out the hair and not trimmed it!!!
4,"Storm, New York","Great item, you will get a very close shave every time. Beats regular shavers!!! I usually use it in the shower. I'm very happy!"
4,Ladies Pink Wet/Dry Shaver,"Bought this product for my 11 yr. old daughter who began shaving her legs several months ago. Razors intimidated her and made her nervous. The shaver has performed wonderfully and she loves it! It is easy to hold and use, it is not slippery at all. She has not used it in the shower but there is no reason to think it would not perform well there, too. 2 thumbs up!! Great product for the price. (and what girl wouldn't like the pink one! mine did.)"
1,Broke after a few uses,"I bought this shaver and was pleased with it until the trimmer blade broke after a few uses. I called Panasonic to get a replacement and they gave me nothing but a run around. I was disappointed with the razor breaking but was even more disappointed with the God awful customer service from Panasonic. If you buy is razor, just cross your fingers it never breaks!"
1,I thought a shaver was suppose to shave off the hair?,"I was really disappointed with the Panasonic ES2216PC. I've been a long time user of straight razors and I thought I would save money from buying expensive replacement cartridges and save the earth from tossing out blades by buying an electric razor. So I choose this razor hoping to get the same close smooth shave that I got from the straight razor and boy, was I wrong. This razor did not get as close to the skin, even after pushing really hard with the spring loaded head, it still left hair stubble! The head of th razor also pulled on my skin which hurt! The button to turn the razor on and off, seemed flimsy like it would break at any moment. If you accidently pushed the wrong button, the button on the head of the razor, then the cap on the head and the razors inside would go flying across the shower. What a mess! So I returned the razor, and I am back to using my straight razor for a smoother shave."
1,Not good,This product does not shave well and it scratches the skin should you use it dry. I tried it a few times with and without cream and soap and whatever else I could think of. It just does not work well. Shaving dry did not work either as it scratched my skin.
1,A waste of money!,"Like ""Kari"" from Colorado, I've always used Remington ladies razors and needed a new one, so I started researching and found this Panasonic. I decided to give it a try since it was less expensive and sounded like it would work well. I am SO SORRY I spent my money on this one and will be going back to Remington even though they cost a little more. I can't believe there are not more women complaining about how uncomfortable this razor is to use! Like Kari, I ended up with scratches up and down my legs that actually burned until they healed (from the raised sides)..OUCH!! I do NOT get a close shave like I did with my Remington and it takes me twice the time because I have to keep going over and over the same areas. Very disappointed with this purchase!"
2,Not Really Impressed,I am not sure why manufacturers can't make a high end razor for women. Skip this and just by a better men's electric shaver.
1,Didn't like this one,"Too loud - doesn't have a close shave, but would do in a pinch..which is what it will also do to your skin."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this after reading all of the great reviews. I was highly disappointed. Not only was it impossible to get anywhere near a close shave, it gave me a rash."
1,Worst shaver ever,"This is the worst shaver that I have ever purchased in my entire life!It doesn't even shave your skin clean.No matter if you keep shaving over and over, the result is the same.I am not pleased at all.Really wish I could get a refund or choose some other item."
2,Worse than a manual razor,"I bought this razor after studying other higher-priced razors & decided that this was a good price/performance bargain and also because I had really not heard of a bad Panasonic product. Turns out that my assumption was totally wrong. This one was so lame that it was worse than a mechanical razor. If you had a Venus or Gillette in your hand, you atleast had better control. This one was the same physical effort but without the clean shaving blades to it. All it has is a fancy head and batteries. Both the dry & wet-mode were equally disappointing. So I ended up promptly returning it & getting a refund.Please pass on this one & move on to the next in the list"
3,Buzzzzzzzzz!!!!,This electric shaver is so not quiet. It makes a loud noise. You should charge it after every use. It does an okay job. It could have been a little cheaper.
2,Not happy :(,Very dissappointed with this product. Doesn't shave close enough and its not durable because it comes apart easily. My manual dissposables are better than this over priced shaver.
2,Don't expect a close shave!,Don't expect a close shave with this shaver. In fact I have to go over my legs twice to get to where I don't feel razor stubble on my legs. I would not recommend this product.
2,Not the best choice,"I wouldn't recommend this shaver to anyone. The batteries die frequently and unless you shave your legs from all possible angles, it just leaves your legs stubbly."
4,close shave,my former shaver no longer charged after two years....so wanted to try a different make. So far I like it... and it gives a close shave.
4,Nice razor,Mrs. John: The razor works well for me. I had a little trouble connecting it to charge it but that's my little disability problem. Worth the money if your satisfied with an electric shave vs. blade.
1,horrible!,"I purchased this shaver to replace a remington that died....this shaver feels as though it's scratching my legs when I use it. it does not give a close shave. when I called panasonic, they said it sounded as if the foils needed to be replaced, but their warranty DID NOT COVER IT, even though I purchased this shaver a few days ago. they suggested contacting amazon, where I purchased it. I told them it was THEIR product, and they should do something about it, but they refused. DON'T BUY THIS SHAVER.....it's horrible....and panasonic's customer service is deplorable."
2,Worked well for a month . . .,"This worked well for a month, then started to fall apart. The tin wrapped around the one section fell off completely. The button that you need to push up to extend the shaving section broke. The on/off button broke."
1,The Most Useless Womens Shaver / Razor I Have Ever Tried,"This razor is by far the worst electric shaver I have ever bought. It is pretty but looks are deceiving especially in this case. I would rather shave my legs with a butter knife than to ever use this piece of garbage. I was looking at razors to replace my wonderful Remington razor. The new Panasonic simply does not cut, it is flimsy, it makes your legs itchy. There are no redeeming qualities that I can even share. Oh, it is pretty in pink but in this case screw the color. I would take one in puke green as long as it worked as well as my oldRemington WDF-1600 Smooth & Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeabledid."
2,Panasonic ES2216 Shaver,"I bought this razor in January 2011 and it has stopped working already. I realize it's only $30 but for only 9 months of use, not worth it."
2,Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver,"So far not so good. The dry shaving results did not meet our expectations. After several tries the results did not yield a smooth shave. Perhaps some adjustments need to be made, but she has not been happy with the results so far. Perhaps the wet mode will be better, but that wasn't the intent."
2,Works Great Until It Breaks,"I purchased this shaver in July of 2011. By the end of August, the pop-up trimmer switch had jammed. I called the warranty number for Panasonic. After the ""automated assistant"" was unable to understand what I needed, I was referred to a human who also had trouble understanding what I needed. She told me I would need to ship my entire razor to either New York or California to have it fixed. I asked if I would have to pay shipping; she did not answer. She gave me a telephone number to call which was not toll free. I asked for and received a toll-free number, but when I called it I was referred to the non-toll free number. The razor cost less than $30; it's not worth paid calls and shipping costs and who knows how long a wait to get it fixed. I'll just buy a different razor to replace it, and it won't be a Panasonic!"
2,I was expecting better,I read all the other reviews on how good this razor was. I was pretty disappointed when I used it. It's not something I can use everyday with getting a clean shave. It gave me razor burn in my armpits too so I highly recommend not using it there! It doesn't trim the hair unless you grow it out long enough. Not recommended.
1,bad,"It does not work well. I only used it once but it hurt my skin, I doubt its quality and recommend you to take a lesson and not to buy it."
2,Not as great as when I first bought,"I bought this razor back in June, and it was fine. However, after only 4 months (maybe using it twice a week), it is terrible. I run over and over the same area and no hair comes off. I've ordered a new Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set, so we'll see if that solves the problem. If it does and I have to replace it every 4 months, I'm going to be upset. Also, I found the set cheaper on 1800 parts dot com with free shipping.ETA: I've replaced the foils, which doesn't seem to have fixed the problem. There are also no instructions on the web that I can find on how to replace them - we had to take a tiny screw driver and pry out the old ones. The new ones seem to pull on my skin/hair. I think I might just try a men's razor. I'm sad this is the best reviewed women's electric razor. It seems like my old one that bit the dust was much better."
1,Worked OK while it lasted,This was never a great product. It worked OK but charges never lasted very long. I didn't use it a lot as I usually shave w/a blade. I tried to charge it recently but it wouldn't recharge. It is only two years old and lightly used. Ridiculous that something like this would last such a short time.
3,"Good, but...","I have coarse, dark hair that grows quickly and fair skin, so I normally shave with a razor every other day. I have never tried an electric shaver before. I have only used the Panasonic shaver dry at this point. It was easy to use and gave my legs the appearance of being shaven, but my legs still felt rough and stubbly. It's something I would use if I didn't have time to shave with a razor before going to the gym, but not if I really wanted my legs to feel smooth. I tried the bikini attachment,and all it did was catch and pull the hair. It did not cut it at all. I would recommend this for people that don't have coarse hair or for occasional use when appearance is all that matters."
2,"great experience for 5 months, then turned dangerous","I've used this product for about five months and originally wrote a glowing 5-star review of it. It worked great, except for the battery charge (instead of 12 hours, it lasted on average 45 minutes per charge). After five months, however, when shaving my arm-pit, I felt a sharp pain. It turned out that the blade closest to the bikini pop-out trimmer had partially popped out and had given me a pretty big cut. I am not sure whether this malfunction was a very rare exception or not (judging by other reviews, it seems like it may be),but it shook me up (I'd hate to think what may have happened if I were using it on a more sensitive area, which it is advertised for). Amazon, however, has been very prompt with the response to my complaint and has promised to issue a full refund. I hope this is an exception to an otherwise great product."
4,Great choice for girl's first shaver,"It was time for my granddaughter to begin shaving. But razors can be a bit scary with sharp blades! Even though an electric shaver does not shave as close as a blade shaver, it also does not nick! This is a pretty device (I ordered the mauve, kind of a pearlized pink color) and is easy to hold and to use. It holds a charge for a long time. For closest results, go over the area in every direction and do both straight and circular movements."
4,Sharp blade. Must charged directly at power supply since there is no cord,"This thing has very sharp blade, no accidentally pulling of hair. Howerver, charging it is a nightmare because there is no cord at all on the charger. It need to sit directly next to the power supply. Taking it in and out of charger is difficult since there is not much room near my power supply. Keeping it, due to its good price and blade but with a grudge...bah."
2,cheap buttons,"I was astonished. I am trying Amazon Prime, and I ordered this AND RECEIVED it the next day! I was thrilled. The unit itself is attractive, and I liked it over all, it worked very well. And then the very first time I used it, the button to lift the pop up trimmer broke. I was very disappointed. This is a $30.00 item. I would have paid a dollar or two more for metal, or at least hard plastic, buttons."
4,Panasonic shaver,I had a old Panasonic electric and this one is so much better. I shaves much closer & has less drag. I love this razor and wish I had purchased it years ago. Be sure to follow the charging directions and do not leave it charging while not in use or it will ruin the battery.
1,Does not work,"It worked great in the beginning, but then after a few months it would no longer hold a charge. I left it on he charger all night and it still only worked for about 30 seconds. Company I purchased it from will not let me return it."
1,Stick to Old Fashion Razors,Never purchased an electric razor and boy I never should have. This razor does not do a good job at all. I would use this then have to go back with razor and finish the job. Could never get a smooth feel at all.The sides scrape your legs and the on/off button is hard to use when your hands are wet.Sure wish I would have never bought this....will trash this and go back to the good ol razor and shaving cream
3,"Great trimmer, lousy razor","trimmer & attachment works great, when wet is best. Razor only works ok when it's dry. If you're looking for a super smooth close shave, go with a manual razor, otherwise this is great on the go."
1,bad quality,"I bought this half a year ago. It works at the first few times, but not as clean as the straight razor. After a few month, it fails. Really bad quality!"
3,It works for shorter hair,"I only use this shaver for the edge of my bikini area- not the whole thing. I think it would really hurt if you are going for the Brazilian look, because it has yanked a couple of hairs that it shouldn't have in the past! I am happy with the purchase however, because it trims what it needs to trim so that I can wear a swimsuit without... well, you know. Plus, it doesn't give me ingrown hairs/bumps like my regular razor. As other reviews mentioned, it doesn't really give a super-smooth shave, but if that isn't important to you, this is a good buy."
2,Panasonic Close Curves Wet//Dry Ladies Shaver,Contrary to their claims Panasonic does not have the sharpest blades. Previously had a Remington which shaved better and closer. Their advertisement got me but I will not purchase another Panasonic Shaver. ACM
1,Horrible,I purchased this to replace another razor that stopped working. Like another reviewer said you have to go over the area a lot of times to get the hair. It let my armpit very irritated.
1,Terrible,"Unfortunately this product didn't work for me at all. It barely shaves any hair. It is completely useless for the ""bikini"" area, whether using the attachment or not. With the attachment, it did not get rid of any hair AT ALL. It's like just running a comb through your hair. For legs and underarms, it would randomly skip patches of hair. And like another reviewer said, whatever hair it does get, it then spits out back onto your skin. (This happened the very first time I used it, so it wasn't because it hadn't been cleaned). Even when pressing it down hard onto my skin, it still didn't get the hair. I tried wet, dry, with shaving cream, without. Nothing worked. You should also know that the manual claims the battery will last for ""7 shaves, 3 minutes per shave"" so that's 21 minutes. I would give it 0 stars if I could. Huge waste of money.Edited to add: It also kept tugging on the hair, which was painful."
4,good,My wife says it's very easy to use and does a very good job. The one she had before would cut and scratch her legs.
1,shaver,i bought this electric SHAVER IN BED BATH AND BEYOND AND AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS IT DID NOT WORK . WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO NOONE
4,Does the job.,"This product does the job but it isn't as great as the shaver i was using. I was using my BF's Norelco but he got tired of me forgetting to charge it and made me get my own.I chose this one based on reviews and honestly expected a bit better. The longer hair shaver piece isn't as powerful as my old one, but nonetheless it does the job."
4,Product seem OK for the price point.,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She tried it and said it was very good but didn't cut as close as she had hoped it would. She's used to using a disposable razor which I'm sure would cut closer. This was expected so she was satisfied with it since it would at least avoid being cut from a razor nick. It is also a little bit noisy during use compared to my Norelco electric shaver I use on my facial hair.
3,its ok,I'm still trying this product out and I'm not sure how I feel about the purchase yet. the item did come in quick.
2,Chintsy,"I bought this in May 2011 on sale for $15 and just recently threw it in the trash. I used it about a dozen times.My original intention was to have something handy for a quick decent-ish dry shave. I know electric razors don't get as close as the real thing, but this Panasonic left me feeling like a wildebeest.Maybe I am a wildebeest. Hard to tell these days.First few times I used it, it worked o.k. Maybe a 3 star product. Definitely lacking in the longevity department. Made of cheapie plasticky pieces.Battery life seemed decent.I would definitely not use the bikini attachment or get this thing anywhere near my crotch."
2,Dead in 7 months,"I purchased this in November of 2011. Granted that's awhile ago. My main problem is, once the battery stops charging, you can't replace the battery. I took it apart to see if there was a rechargeable battery inside. If you plan to do the same, don't bother. I thought it should last at least a year AND have replaceable batteries. Now it just has to go to the landfill. I gave it 2 stars only because it did work well for a shaver. Not as close as a blade razor but good enough if you're not picky about being picky"
4,Panasonic Curves ladies shaver,Convenient. Not powerful but accessible. Charges quickly and holds the charge through an extensive shave. Item arrived quickly. Packaged extremely securely.
4,Works Great,"I got this in time from amazon.This works great, but need to be careful with handling, if it falls, it won't work as expected.The blades seem to run but they don't do the job.But in all works nice, the battery seem to work for 45 min at one go."
4,Women's electric razor,I was very pleased to find this item in your stock. I had been looking at many stores for this item but none of them carry it anymore. I had this same razor but broke it so this was an added bonus.
4,A Cleaning Precaution,"I like this shaver. It's very gentle, as promised. I ran into a problem when I tried to give it a Spring Cleaning. I am used to being able to take shavers apart to clean them and then put them back together. I ran into a problem with this shaver. I had a hard time getting the foils back in straight, and two tiny metal pieces popped out from a crevice behind the foils. I never did get the two pieces to go back in. The foils are no longer evenly spaced, but the shaver works as well as ever, so I guess it's okay. I will be hesitant to take it apart to clean it again, even so."
2,"Bad Battery, disappointing",I really liked this shaver until the battery stopped holding a charge after about 11 weeks. I looked into buying a new battery but the cost of it didnt make sense. I am really disappointed in this product. It is a shame because the shaver is very good otherwise.
3,Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves,"I think it is adequate--no better or worse than any other electric razor I have owned. But that's just me. I think razors perform at a different level for women based on various factors. I am still searching for one that works really well for me. Haven't found it in nearly 40 years, but maybe someday...."
4,supersaver,The shaver works great and keeps its charge for quite a while. Delivery was a little slow.
2,Horrible Charger Design,"Bought this for my wife. The charger is a small block designed so that the razor balances on top while plugged into a VERTICALLY ORIENTED outlet. If, like our house, your outlets are oriented horizontally, the razor sticks out sideways and will not remain on the charger. I called Panasonic's support line hoping that they would have an alternate charger available. Their only suggestion was to visit a hardware store to find an adapter to turn the outlet. Unacceptable, horrible, short sighted product design."
4,Good dry shaver,"This shaver works well dry, I have not used it wet. I do not get as close a shave as I do with a regular wet razor, but for a quick shave it works fine. I got tired of having to always heat up the bathroom, take a long shower or bath in order to shave and not have goosebumps on my legs. That is why I bought a dry shaver, and I like it so far. I have had it only a few weeks and have only charged it once."
3,Close shave,Easy to clean. No nicks. Shaves well. Would have liked it better if it had a stand to put it on when recharging instead of sticking it on an outlet. Actually would have liked a razor that you could use with or without a cord but couldn't find one. It is okay for the price.
4,it works,"This is a bit of a change for me since the last trimmer I had, which did not have protective foil on it. That one did a great close shave, but sometimes it pinched the delicate parts a bit, so you had to be real careful. Fortunately, I don't have that problem with this one, but the foil makes it harder to get a neat close shave. It's still possible, just takes longer..... which starts to hurt my back after being hunched over in the shower for a while. It's nice that it's wet/dry and I still prefer it to waxing or razor shaves."
5,Wonderful Shaver!,"After using regular blade razors my entire adult life, I wanted to try an electric razor and, on the basis of the favorable reviews here on Amazon, decided on this one. I've used it on legs and bikini area for about two months and am very pleased and quite impressed with the close shave - never expected the great results I get. It's doing the job and I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,Just love this razor!,"This little razor is just wonderful. I thought that I wanted another name brand but my price point and their price point were way off. So based strictly on the reviews I got this one. I love the wet/dry factor, I love how easy it is to recharge(my previous razor had a home base and a cord which took up a lot of space), and the one thing that I thought I'd never use, the pop-up trimmer, I use all the time. I do agree with some of the previous reviews the bikini trimmer is useless but everything else makes up for that. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!"
5,A very good shaver,"After about 2 weeks of using this shaver, I must write and say this: It is better than any other I have used in a long time. It shaves closer and smoother, hugs the curves better, and has a longer battery power than the brand I have been using for many years. I have only used it dry without shaving gel and I have suffered no nicks, no burns, no irritation, no bumps. The price is also good."
1,Disappointing,"I had a Remington wet/dry trimmer that I loved, until it stopped working out of nowhere. I decided to try to upgrade to something a little larger, that wouldn't crap out on me after a few months, and eventually decided on this one after researching and reading reviews. Unfortunately, I can't say anything good about it. If I use it to try to trim longer hair, it pulls and pinches but doesn't actually cut the hair (whether I use the shaving head or the pop-up trimmer head). On shorter hair, I still don't feel as if it actually shaves, and it scratches uncomfortably against my skin. I don't think I've gotten one good shave out of this thing."
1,Agrrrr.......,"This product came as a faulty one. I can't charge it with the charger that came with. Actually I can get it to charge if I hold and tilt the shaver to one side but as soon as I let go, it stops charging. I tried using the shaver and I have to say I wouldn't give up my Gillette razor for this. It could be handy if you travel and only need a relatively decent shave, as it didn't cause me razor burn when used dry."
1,Does not give a close shave at all,I found myself having to go over and over and over the same spot on my leg and I could still never get a smooth shave. I was pretty disapointed with the product and will go back to my boring shavers.
2,Already Dull,"The first time I used this fresh out of the box, I was amazed. I thought I finally found an electronic razor that actually did something. But a few months later and it's just like the rest of them. Doesn't cut much...seems dulled already. I wanted to use it for quick shaves when I didn't have time for a full one, but it's pointless now as to shave any hair takes 5x as long as a shave in the shower with a regular razor."
1,Panasonic Wet / Dry ES2218 Equates to GARBAGE...,I bought this product for my wife and she barley used the device attempting to make it last; the unit still looks new out of the box and its DEAD.I can't believe this PANASONIC died with minumim use and Panasonic is suppose to make a great product however I don't think so and could and would not recomend their product. What a waste of $$$ and time...
5,First Time Purchaser,Excellent product--Very satisfied. Will definitely purchase a Panasonic shaver for my personal use after the quality and performance of this ladies model.
4,Great razor for sensitive skin.,I don't think any electric razor is as good as a regular razor but this one is fine. It is reasonably priced also.
2,More like the epilady for bikini area,The bikini shaver pulls hairs out and causes hair follicle cysts.This does not have any closer of a shave than the other electrics I have used.
3,wow - in the water skills . . . but definately not a close shave,"so, I've wanted to dry one of these since I've heard they've come a long way. And yes, it is cool how water immersible it is. And I don't have anxiety that it is going pull or hurt - so those are improvements.but if a close shave is what you need, this doesn't do that.it is my quick go between that helps make things a little softer -- but still in need of a razor shave."
4,Excellent product!!,Excellent product. Battery last sooo much compared to my last one!! Needs light to tell when battery is ending and a brush to clean it.
5,This is it!,"Having had a previous shaver that didn't shave closely, I was apprehensive about finding 1 that did. This is it!! Closest shave I've ever had with an electric razor. I highly recommend it!"
3,Serves the purpose,"I bought this so that my daughter can learn to shave her legs. It is what I would consider adequate. It does the job, both dry and wet. Do I consider it a particularly close shave for someone like myself who normally uses an Intuition razor? No. Is it wonderful for a girl just getting comfortable with shaving and does it do an acceptable job of it? Yes. I would never buy one for myself but it's great for helping her have a safe, easy way to shave."
2,BE CAREFUL!,"The very first time I used this, things started out fine. However, by the time I was done, the corners of the razor had nicked me four times- and by nick, I mean take out a triangle chunk of skin! I was careful the whole time, but there was no avoiding it. The shave was alright, not the best, and definitely not worth the ugly painful gouges!"
3,Not as expected!,"Ive used ladies electric shavers all my life. I expected this product to be one of the best since its from the reputable panasonic brand. However Im disappointed. It does the job but have to run it several times plus it gives me ingrowths. I used a cheaper conair shaver where the blades were sharper & gave me a much closer shave, almost like the razor and never had ingrowths either. I wouldnt buy another panasonic shaver again in a hurry."
4,Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver,"As others have stated, this is a good (not excellent) shaver. It does not shave as close as a razor. This is fine for a rush job -- I still have a little stubble left after shaving. The charger, to me, is upside-down -- meaning the shaver hangs from the charger rather than sits on it and sometimes may fall if not really secure."
1,Too Small,This is definelty NOT the large piggy bank that it claims to be. Very small and do not believe the user photo that was added. This piggy bank would fit in the palm of your hand
5,Perfect Piggy Bank,I purchased this for my niece on her second birthday and I immediately got a video message from my sister letting me know how pleased she(along with my niece) was with the purchase. There was an actual tinge of jealousy in my sister's voice. Apparently she'd had a bank like this when we lived in Germany and it somehow got lost and/or broken during a move. I know it's going to get taken care of.I was pleased to see how large it was and I know that my niece will get a lot of use out of it.
1,Buyer beware!,"When I looked at this item it had a picture of it next to a baby that showed it as large as a newborn child, when I received it in the mail to my surprise it was only about 5 inches long and the box it came in was in pitiful shape and the satin was all frayed."
2,Shattered during shipping,"Very unhappy with the vendor. They shipped this ceramic piggy bank without extra care. No ""fragile"" label was put on the shipping box and the shiping box doesn't have extra padding inside to absorb any unwanted impact. When I got home and picked up the box from the front door, I could hear the noises from the broken piece rattling inside the box. Obviously the shipper heard the rattling noise from the broken ceramic too but didn't care at all and just left the box for me.Thankfully Amazon was great and gave me a full refund including return shipping charges.I like the piggy bank, but I won't buy it online again because I'm afraid that it will be broken every time. I ended up going to our local baby store and get another Mud Pie Geramic Piggy Bank. The store only has the other pricess design with the crown on the head, but it is okay, just as cute. Have to get the Giant size though, it is 10x cuter than the Large size."
5,Great for cake pops!,These candies worked great for coating cake pops! 1 lb package was perfect for 1 batch of cake pops that made about 3 dozen pops.
4,Merckens white chocolate,"The white chocolate discs arrived quickly. The flavor was outstanding, I would like to find them in a local store. My only concern was that they arrived in one large block of chocolate, instead of the easy to seperate discs. But, chopping it up was easy enough. Great chocolate!"
2,merckens white coating,"I was very excited to not have to go to the store. I received the product on time, however it was in a big clump. I think it melted during shipping."
1,WILL NOT EJECT or TURN OFF!,"We bought this a few years ago, but have hardly ever used it. So the problem is not because it's wearing out, or because of abuse.It stopped ejecting this last year. It won't turn off either. Sometimes it indicates a DVD, sometimes not. Pressing eject generally starts the DVD if it does anything.I just called the customer service number on the DVD player, and the recording says that Sanyo is 'in the process' of discontinuing (or has already done so, since I didn't get a live person)their customer phone service for audio, dvd players and something else that I didn't catch. No luck there.I would definitely not recommend Sanyo products at this point. A quick search on the internet also indicated several similar problems with this model."
5,"Deep smart thoughts about the misteries of Wall Street,","I red this book once and about thirty years ago. I remained immediately impressed by the original and strange way to face problems of communications between traders, brokers and the entire world around the stock exchanges of the world. After so many years, I still remember the intriguing profoundness of its contents and now I know how the entire financial world is totally dominated by these unsolved problems of communication much more that by rationale behaviour and logic reactions of people involved."
3,not so great...,"In contrast to other reviewers, I was less satisfied with this text. I have two main complaints:1) Too many stretches are described as dangerous or damaging. I'd argue the key to avoiding such injury is to learn to listen to the body...performed gently, most of their 'bad' stretches are perfectly safe.2) Since stretches are identified only by numbered photos, it's rather awkward to use the book to find stretches by muscle group or common name (eg., side-kick stretch, neck roll, etc)."
3,"Outdated, I Think","While there are a lot of good things about this book they show almost NO stretches for the feet and ankles. I am a long distance over 50 walker and the way I found out about stretches for my feet and ankle strength and shin splits was to go to P.T. The pictures are good and they do show stretches for a wide variety of sports.I think, for its time, it was really good but there are probably way better books nowadays.."
5,Josephine P -D.C. Homeopathic Medicine,"This book is a fantastic reference book. I recommend it to all of my patients and non-homeopathic medical colleagues. This book guides you to the remedy better than almost any book I have seen. In homeopathy everything must be individualized. If you give the right remedy the patient gets better very quickly, however, if you choose the wrong remedy little will happen. This book will help you increase your accuracy and get people better faster. Your family will thank you!! If there is only one homeopathic book on your bookshelf, this should be it."
4,Great Classic,Great basic book on homeopathy! Good distiction between things you can take care of on your own and symptoms that would require more attention from a professional. Gives you basic concepts and practical applications.
2,Textbookish,This wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for a concise listing of homeopathic items and uses. This was over the top. TMI (to much information)
3,Everybody's Guide to Homeopathic Medicines,"This book is jam packed full of information, but a little difficult to learn how to put all of that information together for a correct remedy for a specific illness. All the information is in the book, it's just hard trying to figure out how to use it."
1,Leave It At the Store,"I personally found the book uneasy to read and not something that I couldn't find in other books that were much more reader-friendly. The section on understanding homeopathy is much better described in ""Impossile Cure"" and the info on case-taking is explained better in ""The Complete Guide to Homeopathy"" I wouldn't recomment this book at all."
3,I wish they would have sent me the newer version..,"I am not mad at the book however I am mad at the time it took for my book to arrive also the fact that they sent me the wrong version. I am not sure if there is a difference but I imagine the newer version may have corrections and such. So I am a bit disappointed. I also wish the book was set up differently, I was looking for more like a dictionary and a bit more history. Also a bit more info on why and how. I am aware it will take a lot more research, I feel this book definitely did not answer my questions. I will work with this book for now until I find a better book on Homeopathic Meds..."
1,400 pages all blank.,"You can say that this book is detailed in the same way that a book on unicorn anatomy might have lots of horn diagrams.A book written with irresponsible self-important delusion for the unfortunately misled and wilfully ignorant.If you took a tiny piece of this book diluted it in 100 parts water, banged it and repeated the process 200 times it would be no less useful."
3,"Alright, but definitely not ULTIMATE","I am an avid Taebo fan, but the intensity is lacking in this one. If you can fake smile and high-five each other during the routine then the workout is too easy. The ""dance"" section is cheesy. This workout is longer (90 mins compared to 55mins), but less intense. If you are looking for a difficult workout, I would HIGHLY recommend the Taebo Get Ripped:Advanced Series. There are (2) 55 min workouts and (1) 8 min workout."
5,Great work out,"This dvd is longer, the work out is 90 minutes but it is doable because some of the sections are not very intense. It really gets the calories burning and I am certain I burned more than 600! I would highly recommend it. As always Billy Blanks delivers and is a great motivator. The dance moves were fun."
4,Ultimate Tae Bo,"Offers a really good workout. There is even some dancing in the middle of the set to change the tone a bit. If that's not your thing, then you can just fast forward to the more advanced moves for the last thirty minutes of the video."
5,A.W.E.S.O.M.E.,"I've been a fan of Billy Blanks Tae Bo for years. I bought this DVD and let me just say, you're work out clothes will be dripping in sweat. I agree with one of the reviews that someone posted. If you're a beginner,I wouldn't suggest it until you work you're way up. Everytime I do this workout, I feel I won't make it, and I never stop in a workout. I always go to the finish line! Just like Billy Blanks saids. GO TO THE FINISH LINE! LOL. This workout is for an hour, then there's the extra 30 minutes, that you feel you won't be able to do, but I have a few times..and it's so awesome when you finish. The music is awesome. And so is his crew, aren't they always! Billy Blanks voice is so motivational, it helps me thru. THIS ROCKS AND I WOULD SUGGEST THIS TO AN ADVANCED PERSON who wants a BIG CHALLENGE! =) Good Luck!"
2,"Too much dance, not enough TaeBo","I LOVE TaeBo but this video seriously missed the mark. It's a longer video but there is very little actual TaeBo workout here...I could have done without the dancing...I don't do TaeBo to dance. I have so many of his other dvds that truly deliver...unfortunately, this one does not. I gave it two stars for the 10 minutes or so of an actually workout."
4,Fun workout,You get actually 3 workouts on this DVD. the first one is 1-1/2 hour but actually has a break after the first 60 minutes so you can quit then or keep going or just do the last 1/2 hour and then there a separate 30 minute fat burning workout as well. I sometimes do the entire 90 minute but sometimes I break them up. The 30 minute fat burning workout is good too. They must have the workout rooms temperature turned way up because I barely break out in a sweat with the 30 minute workouts on Taebo and everyone on the video is soaking wet.
3,Nothing like the original...,"I'm a HUGE Tae Bo fan. I lost 20 lbs over a summer during high school thanks to the original workout: Tae Bo Advanced. I also have 3 other Tae Bo DVDs, but I have to say none of the newer workouts and especially ""Ultimate"" Tae Bo compare to the original. What's great about the original workout was the intensity of it, Billy Blanks would start you out with a technique and then increase the speed and intensity of it without and breaks in between. This DVD has nothing like that. I used to sweat bullets doing the orginal Tae Bo Advanced on VHS and with this DVD, I barely broke out a sweat. This DVD is good...but not great like it used to be. If you love everything Tae Bo, then this is for you but if you want a true challenge(and to burn over 800 calories like I do in less than an hour) then buy Tae Bo Advanced, it's only on video but it's very good."
2,not what they promised,"I really do not understand everything that is written on this site about this DVD. I kept reading how intense this workout is and I must disagree strongly. I have been using the TaeBo II Get Ripped DVD for almost 2 years now and I have grown tired of it. So I went looking for something new from the Billy Blanks series. I wanted to be sure it was going to be a nonstop intense workout, which is what the Get Ripped workout is. NO GO! This Ultimate DVD does not live up to its name. The biggest problem is that there are too many slow periods. With each new move, Billy does at least three slow sets before moving to the double time. Then he only does two maybe three double time sets. That is not what I call intense. If you want intense, get Get Ripped. I guess I am back to my same old workout until I can find something that lives up to its advertisement."
2,Lacks Intensity,"I've been doing Tae Bo for several years and love the Tae Bo Advance workouts. The Ultimate Tae Bo is good for someone who is just starting an exercise program, but it lacks the intensity for people who already have a decent degree of fitness. Even with weighted gloves I struggled to get my heart rate into my training zone..."
4,Good workout but...,The workout itself is good. I bought it to alternate with turbo jam workout. I just can't get used to all that counting. To me it's annoying. I also wish music was a bit louder.
3,Extra Long Workout,"You have to make sure to strech before you put this video on because Billy jumps right into the work out. This video seems like it works more of your arms and abs. This work out is very long, you start with a hour work out and take a quick water break and jump right back into in for another 30 mins, so if you have that time, go for it. He does have a dance part as other viewers have mentioned which i did not like. Its a good work out though."
4,Could be a great workout,"I need to try this workout on a high energetic day. When I tried to workout to this DVD it just to not get me enthused. Billy is always motivating however at the start of the workout the participants in the DVD seemed uncoordinated, and lacking energy. Personally, I just dont like the stage set up either. Very dark colors and small."
5,The Most Incredible Test,"I am new to writing out a review but i had to comment about this dvd. I love it! I am not new to TaeBo or to working out. I prefer Zumba and The Firm but wanted something to kick my butt. THIS surely did the job. Its long yes and I had to modify a few movements but don't mind because i was dripping sweat. Billy is his usual self, motivating and willing you along. If you want to increase stamina and push yourself to the max this is one dvd for you."
2,The original Tae Bo was way better,...My title above says it all. I didn't feel the burn or work up a sweat nearly as much as I did with the original Tae Bo series. There are 2 workouts on this DVD. One's about 89 minutes and the other is 23 minutes. So you're either stuck with an hour and a half cardio session or one so short you don't even work up a sweat.
3,not that hard...too long,"I bought this excited that I would get an advanced calorie burning long workout. It was really long, and not that hard. He does werid dancing gyrating moves for the abs in the middle that is annoying, and all the people in the background are annoying as well. Cathe wotkouts are harder and they are not annoying. I will look around for a more advanced Tae bo workout, because I really like kickboxing. I will add weights and do jacks when he is resting to make it harder and keep my heart rate up."
2,Pick a different one if you want an intense workout,"I would say I am in fairly average or slightly above average shape and this workout was not challenging in the least. The back of the package promises a ""super intense workout"" but does not deliver. Do not let the word ""ultimate"" scare you away from chosing this DVD for a regular workout--it is fairly entertaining. Just choose another DVD if you want a high-energy workout. Sorry I can't recommend another Tae Bo...although I am not new to kickboxing, I am new to Tae Bo, so you'll need to refer to other reviews for a better choice of DVDs."
2,not what I expected,"I am a semi-athletic 28 year old female. Taebo has been around a long time and I thought I would give it a try. I am very disappointed. Billy may have good technique but this workout is really long and poorly filmed. Billy talks at the same time as another girl repeatedly counts down 1.2.3.4... for every movement--very distracting not to mention annoying. Everything seems so disorganized and tacky. The room looks like an old cigar lounge. I have no desire to work out with it. Maybe there are other Taebo videos that are filmed better but I don't want to waste any more money to find out. Another option would be Turbo jam (I got mine for $12 by a seller here on amazon)which is similar technique but filmed much better,not annoying, and better atmosphere. Also, 30 day shred by Jillian Michaels is professional, pleasing to the eyes and ears, and is just 3 different 20 minute workouts you choose by difficulty level."
3,"Not so great, not so bad.","I had read Sick of Shadows and thought it was pretty good. I ordered Lovely in Her Bones despite the poor reviews and sort of wish I hadn't. Not great, but not bad. The character of Elizabeth is a bit whiney and vapid, and none of the others really took shape in this one. The plot was a bit out there and didn't come together, either. Read some of the other books in this series instead of this one."
2,Amateurish,"I have read and enjoyed several other Sharyn McCrumb mysteries--She Walks These Hills, for instance. However, this book disappoints. The characters are not believable, the dialogue is stilted, and you arrive at the end of the book not much caring how it resolves itself. My error, friends, for not checking the Amazon customer reviews before buying."
2,Elizabeth MacPhearson,"This is the weakest book of the series. I have now read them all, through PMS Outlaws. The book has the witty style of the other Elizabeth MacPhearson mysteries, but didn't hold my interest very well. It is important to the series, though, because it tells us a lot about Milo, who is featured in two subsequent books, and it introduces Elizabeth to forensic anthropology. The ending is a bit of a surprise, so I guess that's in the story's favor."
3,Lovely in Her Bones,"Reading a Sharyn McCrumb book is never dull, but because I was ""hooked"" on her characters I liked this book. She starts out with an intriguing plot but simply fails to follow through. Her volunteer deputy is great. The perfect dolt to add humor to murder. I wanted to hear more about the medical lore and was a little disappointed when that character was revealed to be so ""human"". Perhaps because I have read so many of her books I know what she is capable of expected more. It didn't keep me from going on to the ""next"" book about Elizabeth Macphereson."
3,Cute and witty,"Having been my first mystery novel ever, I enjoyed Lovely in Her Bones. Not for the developed writing style or character development, but for the simple plot that was thoroughly enjoyable to read. Need to relax? Grab hold of this who-dun-it!"
1,One of the weakest Conan books,"What first catches your attention is the terrible, stilted style of writing. Very flat with corny dialogue. Not enjoyable to read, more of a chore. Perhaps a younger reader may enjoy it for the simplified language, although there are some adult themes in the books. A real dud. Avoid it."
1,Hard Book To Finish,"What good things can you say about this book? Nothing. Carpenter is not the best writer of conan. Some where in the middle of the pack or below. He's had some that were ok and some not very good. This one, sinks to an all time low. The main character's name is conan, but that is the only thing this character and the one we all know of as Conan have in common. This book should be hidden away from the public and forgotten. See all other reviews."
3,Not bad but not great.,A simple unsophisticated Conan tale. Slightly different in tone with Conan being a Gladiator rather than a free roaming death dealer. Not terrible but not great I would recommend if you want a generic Conan fix.
2,Russell Crowe...the Barbarian!,"Well,....what can I say. The book is pretty weak. The plot would've been better suited to the Conan cartoon series (remember it?),seriously folks. I honestly can't see Conan staying that long in a city being a gladiator, no less. Also, he strikes me as too intelligent throughout the book. For example, in the arena, he orders them to form a phalanx! He's a barbarian from Cimmeria! How's he gonna know what a phalanx is? I thought the priests of Set might be cool,too, but they were more like Renaissance scientists or something. I only read this book because I want to read all of the Conan books. The end battle was cool, but that's about it. This wasn't one of the better books."
5,inspirational,"This book changed my life. It might seem silly, but it is very true. His advice and outlook on life is infinitely helpful.The exercises will NOT teach you how to beat some one up, but truly that is what is so great about this bookI recommend this book to anyone"
4,"Great book, well written","Buy this book if you wish to be a practitioner of martial arts. No matter what system you are in, you must stretch and breathe, this book walks you through, while explaining philosophy."
5,Yan Ming Shi: Shaolin Workout,"Superb editing & ""reality based instruction"". A true marital artist in the spirit of Bushido. A must for anyone with an intent to prosper in career or life."
5,A most worthwhile purchase!,"Of course it cannot serve as a total substitute for experiencing the real thing, but this book still manages to share a tremendous amount of knowledge in a very accessible format. It contains gorgeous, often stunning, photography as well as helpful and concise instructions. I particularly like the conclusion of each section with a passage of philosophical thoughts. The book does a great job with balancing the presentation of techniques for improving oneself both physically and mentally.Even if you ultimately do not adhere to the exact 28 day regimen as suggested by the subtitle of this book, you will most certainly find many valuable lessons to incorporate into your daily life."
5,Excellent Workout,"I have been working through the Shaolin Workout after receiving it as a Christmas gift. It is a well paced workout, thoughtful and excellent for increasing or regaining flexibility. I find it to be uplifting physically and emotionally with focused meditations after each day's workout. I highly recommend it."
5,Amazing Book,"I feel like this book calls me every morning into action! I love this book. The wisdom of Sifu Shi Yan Ming pours out of every page. I train Choy Li Fut Kung Fu. The workouts are great, but the way of looking at life is even better! In this day and age, everyone wants to ""Be Like Mike."" This book makes me want to ""Be Like Sifu!""Thank You Sifu!Matt KrebsSt. Paul, MN"
4,shaolin workout review,"I found the workout to be wonderful, it is designed to get you doing stuff in baby steps. The only issue I have is that going into week three, the material is quite a lot to remember and if you do not have a martial arts background some of the moves can be very tricky.Otherwise, the reading is wonderful, the pictures are excellent and the workout is awesome, low impact, and makes you feel great. Sifu also instructs on light meditation which is a wonderful addition."
4,Its okay,This is an okay book it is very basic and i didnt understand how exactly this would benefit me so I didnt even try..............unless your dedicated.....I dont recommend this at all........the first chapter is streching...2nd/3rd is basic kicks punches and stances......all i can recommend is you find a shifu or get a different book or movie....try some products from ymaa...much better..Good Luck
2,Shaolin? Sure. Workout? No way!,"The exercises in this ""workout"" are far from challenging. You could learn any (or all) of these techniques in your first week at any martial arts school. There is a certain inspirational spirit that the book does well with, and that's the only thing that saved this book from being a 1 star book.Check out the used book section. How many are being sold (52 copies right now)? Why are so many trying to sell it? How is the price in comparison to the new price (starting at 9 dollars)? Why are people selling it for so little? It isn't just coincidence."
4,Great warm up routine,"This book contains streches and joint rotations not normally done in my routine. When put together, they make for a great morning routine."
2,Fun for his disciples,"This book is one part basic wushu manual, and one part self help book, never really succeeding at either.If you love Yan Ming, ofcourse you'll love this book. It features great pictures and all of his buzz words and daily exclaimations (i.e. ""train harder!"" and ""more chi"").To perform the techniques as he does takes relentless hours of practice, so the 28 days mantra is deceptive at best.The history of the shaolin temple is standard fair and falls behind the current wave of scholarship on the subject.A book best considered entertainment rather than an actual text book on the martial arts.Two stars because the photography is so good."
2,Use Caution,"This is a very glossy, slick book, as is typical of Rodale publications. As such, it is a pleasant -- if over-priced -- overview for the casual reader of basic Shaolin exercise routines. However, as a martial arts practioner for several decades and an instructor with years of experience, I have a serious concern. Some of the stretching exercises in this book are potentially dangerous for the uninitiated, especially older readers who may lack the flexibility to do them safely. If taken seriously as a training manual, this book should almost come with a warning label."
2,Not For Beginners,"This book is a glossy, full color collection of philosophy and exercises that (apparently) Shaolin Monks do. It will not teach you self-defense and only focuses on calisthenics. That would be fine in most cases; however, this book is big, sprawling, and confusing. It is not for beginners. Many of these are exercises are difficult and unorganized. You don't know which to do, and how much, and which would be suitable for your body type. This book is more to satisfy your curiosity about ancient kung-fu than something of a sensible guide to exercise(s). 28 days to transforming your body, it says... Yeah, but how?"
1,Review,This article was never sent for 2 months. I calling for reimbursement! I can not rate it well. Poor service. Be ready for disappointment
5,ID tag for Littman stethescope,After losing another stethescope I decided I needed to permanently ID it. This works well and is impossible to remove unless the ID tag is cut off. I will buy this again when I buy another scope.
3,Everything the picture shows it to be,Didnt like that I had to mail back to the company to get it engraved. I wish it would have been done right away in a one stop purchase. Also to get it engraved it is 7.00 extra.
2,identification tag,I would have preferred an engraved tag as apposed to one I had to write my name onto. It would look more professional.
3,Sturdy but super small,"This product seems quite sturdy but it's better as a stocking stuffer than an actual gift. It's the size of a large hand, but the price isn't small. Further, there were only ""2 left"" when I ordered a new one. When it arrived just days later, the box look quite battered. Rough trip overseas, I guess. We'll see how my 7 year old son likes it once Christmas arrives."
4,"Thorough, Evangelical, and Stimulating","I purchased this volume primarily for Clendenon on Malachi, so this review applies only to that portion of the book.I have found Clendenon to be thoroughly scholarly and very stimulating as I study through Malachi in an expository preaching series. He covers all the critical issues thoroughly and gives many insightful comments on various passages. His comments spur thoughts for personal application of the passages and are very helpful for preaching.I have noticed a few references to the work of the unbalanced John Piper which can be ignored. Piper's one theme approaches sanctification in an unbalanced way. In spite of these comments, Clendenon's work is well worth your purchase if you are studying through Malachi."
1,Do-we hafta read this stuff?,"Clearly a quickie knock-off on the Patrick O'Brian series, about the only thing these books seem to have going for them is that the ""hero"" is so frightfully obnoxious the reader keeps hoping Alan ""Lurid"" Lewrie will get his just rewards. Literally stuck on an island will little choice in reading material, I'll admit to reading two in the series...the second (A King's Commander) in the hopes that something would rattle the prick's marbles sufficiently to make him semi-interesting. Don't bother with this garbage; get the master in historical naval fiction, Mr. O'Brian."
1,A Disappointing Quicky Sequel,"It is disappointing to start a series that had such promise only to have to toil through this poor effort obviously rushed to press. While it is surprising that Lambdin apparently never learned to punctuate properly, it is even more surprising that the publisher did not have an editor on hand to correct this very rough draft. A re-read of anything Patrick O'Brian ever wrote is far more enjoyable."
1,Pandering to the Visual Audience with Gratuitous Sex,"There's no reason for this book to even exist, let alone be published. Lewrie is a '90s sterotype of the 18th Century Gay Blade who has no morals worth mentioning. Though charming in some respects, he cannot be relied on to keep an oath. Why should anyone trust him? Indeed, why should we like him?"
2,Poorly manufactured.,"Very plastic, and cheaply put together. I didn't really have high expectations for such an inexpensive sewing machine to begin with, but not one things about it impressed me. The needle seems woobly, bobbin is difficult. I returned mine."
1,a disaster,"I wasn't expecting anything fancy for the price. I did, however, expect the basic functions of a sewing machine. For example, I expected it to be able to stitch a straight line. Unfortunately, every time I tried, it would go a few stitches and then get tangled up horribly. I adjusted the needle tension over and over, but nothing works. Also, the bobbin tension is pre-adjusted at the factory, and you can't change it!"
1,Junky and hard to use. Cheap!,Purchased 2 of these (separately) for grandaughers learning to sew. It is difficult to use and doesn't sew nicely at all. Better off buying an inexpensive REAL sewing machine to learn on. This is clunky and cheaply made and very frustrating. Wish I had returned them. I let them use my full sized machine and they do just fine.
2,wow i like this machine but.....,i dont really use it i mean i tought it wud be easy to sew wit a machine like thiz but itz not so i gae it to my grandmother and she luvs it....
1,DONT BUY THIS!,"My mom bought this for me when I was nine. The directions were hard to follow and it was and the threading instructions were confusing. At first it worked O.K. But now the machine is jammed for good and I'm very unhappy. No matter how good the machine looks, im telling you, you will wind up returning it!!!"
3,works!,"i ordered two of these as i have weak knees ,am old and overweight but exercise every day but the squats and lunges were killing me.these help a great deal by providing support and i find that my knees actually feel better now that i am able to do some squats.you sweat underneathe but when you remove it you actually feel heat in your kneecaps.these were the cheapest price but after barely a month the material is unraveling on the bottom from the neoprene.wrote to company to tell them ...but never heard back.but these do work"
3,weak support,"I bought this because of the disappearance of what I had, but I had gave me a better support. with the old feel safer playing ball and to go hiking in long slopes, too, yet it is a good product."
2,felicianas architecture,"The book is really not all that great, the writing is below average and the information is really scant. There are pretty pictures, yes, but there is only about a page of text (or less) for each house I would have liked to read more about each plantation house."
5,It is a picture book; an important title,"The winner of the first Coretta Scott King Award for illustration, making it an important title in the history of children's literature. Perhaps the customer who gave it one star did not expect a picture and thus gave it a low rating."
1,Childrens book,"This is nothing more than a childrens little hard back book with 34 pages of reading !It took me approx. 5 min. to ""read "" it !Mostly "" drawn "" illistrations!Would've been a lot better to have gone on the net & read his "" biography "" for free.Don't even bother with this one."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I purchased this thinking it would help my hair after it had been fried by a stylist. The shampoo doesn't lather, the conditioner doesn't detangle, and the ""shine serum"" leaves your hair feeling greasy enough to fry food in it. Biggest waste of money I have ever spent. Wouldn't bother with it again for free!"
1,"Doesn't ""hide fly aways""",I got this for my wife & she really hated it. She used it for about a month & had to stop. She said it dried out her hair & the serum made her hair look oily. It also never hid the fly aways which is why I got this for her in the first place. I ended up buying her the Nexxus damage control and she really likes that.
3,average,"the shampoo & conditioner feel about like most other shampoo & conditioners. the serum works good in very small doses & not used everyday, my hair felt very oily. it smells very good though. overall, I would not spend the money again for these products, next time I will get pantene, it makes my hair feel softer."
2,Be sure you're getting the right product,"I bought this trio pack from a Target store. The shampoo and conditioner are fine but the silk drops have been watered down. I buy the silk drops regularly and they have an oily consistency. These ""drops"" poured into my hand like water and even the scent was light as though it were watered down. I can't speak for ordering online but I can assure you that when shopping for this product, you should be sure it's sealed and not tampered with."
1,don't bother with this - the conditioner is lousy,"the conditioner was very poor - it felt like it had no slip agent for detangling. after rinsing it out my hair felt dry.the main product, a hair serum, is excellent however."
2,These were just OK,"Out of all the CHI products I've tried, these were the least effective as far as the shampoo and conditioner. The silk therapy, however, is pretty nice...I've actually seen people use it on their hair as a finishing product and even on the skin."
5,bill nye,"this is a great video, kids love bill nye. great information and very well delivered. what can you say, bill nye IS the science guy"
3,"Decent bio, but should have been longer","This is a decent bio of Joe Louis, but it only scratches the surface of profiling the ""Brown Bomber's"" career. Too many great fights are not even shown, such as the Primo Carnera bout, and the clips that are shown are way too brief. For example, they show about 25 seconds of the first round of Louis-Braddock. Yet the producers of the show fail to include the moment when Louis is unexpectedly knocked down! This video has some memorable fight clips and interviews (such as Tony Galento whining after his loss to Louis), but it always leaves me wanting to see more. Billy Conn is one of the hosts of this special, and while he was a great fighter and person, he wasn't a good commentator. Still, for $10 bucks I guess you can't expect too much."
4,I Didn't think I liked modern dance,I'm not a fan of Modern Dance but I love Pilobolus. They find many ways to simulate slow motion and create creatures with their bodies in ways that you forget that they are made of human bodies. I saw this when it appeared on PBS TV many years ago and was disappointed that this doesn't contain the whole show.
4,Many stickers to keep the younger ones engaged,"This is hours of fun for the younger ones and will definitely keep them engaged with activities.Recommended if the family has atleast one member who can teach the younger ones of various objects, thus adding educational value to this book. Even otherwise, it will help the kids to be entertained but they wont know what they are playing with.I feel the book is a bit overpriced for $11 and hence removing a star out of 5."
1,If you like sticky stickers...,this is not the book for you. The photos are good enough but the stickers peel back the instant they're affixed. I can't wait for my child to get through the book so I can throw it in the garbage and never have to think of the money I wasted ever again.
1,NO STICK,"I bought for the stickers only, so I could put on my jumbo calendar... Edges curl, and won't lay down.... The actual book is beautifully illistrated, pics are clear & bright (more like photographs)... For my purposes, I won't buy any more of this brand"
3,Only one book...,"I bought this book specifically because the description stated that it was six books that came in a little box with a carrying handle. I thought it would be perfect for my 3 kids so they wouldn't have to argue about who gets the book. When the shipment came, it was only one book, as pictured. It is a nice book and my kids love these type of sticker books, but we were all disappointed that it was not the six individual books as described."
2,Good book- poorly printed,My 2 yr old has been playing with this book for over 6 months. The stickers are very educational though the cars and computers and trains are a bit dated. We've peeled just about every sticker from it and I may buy another copy. Our copy suffered from poor quality control. 20% of the chapters have poor printing that cut the sticker images in half. Make sure you check your copy BEFORE the return deadline.
1,Terrible toy held together by tape,"I literally unpackaged this toy, gave it to my labrador and the toy broke. The ropes are held in their circular form by electrical tape. Needless to say, I got this toy in the mail yesterday and it was in the trash yesterday."
5,I had this book when I was a kid...,I bought this for my daughter because 30 some years later I still remembered it. Hope she remembers it as well. :)
5,"Wise Woman, Wiser Advice","In the spirit of this book, I hope to say more with less words.This is hard to do with many important life lessons discussed! If we're all start ups then this is how to debut your IPO. Most women will experience the corporate carrer during their lifetime. It not only gives ideas to those already in this environment but also to those in high school and college who are on their way. Even better, the writing approach is very down to earth, friendly yet firm, in a mission to make me my best both professionally and personally."
5,Excellent HOB Filter,I have been using the Whisper filters for several years. I just bought 3 more of these and three more of the 30's. They work well are easy to maintain and reliable.
2,Started off fine,"When I bought this filter it was working perfectly and was really quite. I took my tank down and put the filter up for two months, when I set my tank back up and hook this filter back up it was extremely loud. I've tried jiggling the intake tube, pulling it up slightly and letting it catch on it's own instead of me forcing the impeller in place, still no luck. I don't know why this happened but the filter started off great. Even with the loud noise it still cleans the tank well."
4,Nice little filter gets the job done,Taking care of my little extra tall 20 gallon tank with gold fish. Was happy it came with a filter to start me off and its quiet to.
2,Leaks,"Not sure why the maker of this product puts a valve in the bottom of filter, more chances of leaking and I just received the filter that leaks, always fill the filter with water before you put it on the tank to check for leaks."
1,Lasted 2 Months,"I bought this product in August to replace my very old filter, and it died in October for no apparent reason. I had done nothing that would effect the filter, and could not get it to start again. One night it was working, the next morning, it was dead. I am very dissatisfied and unhappy with this product, especially one that is meant to help keep your tank healthy!"
1,not the same as before,Found them a pain to eat. Wrapper is very hard to get off. Not the same old Jolly ranchers
3,Not for experienced musicians.,"This is probably a good book for children and/or complete musical novices, but those with even minimal musical experience might better look elsewhere."
3,NOT PARTICULARLY ESSENTIAL,"The book isn't only about Led Zep IV - it provides a general history of the band and many of the author's own interpretations. It's arguable - very arguable - if anyone would agree that the title of the book ""When the Levee Breaks"" is the most essential rock track ever recorded after Stairway to Heaven...highly debatable! If you've read ""Hammer of the Gods"" or other Zep texts - this will seem somewhat superfluous. No real new observations. The portion on the making of Zep IV is good - but really wouldn't fill up a book. More like an article..."
3,Repetitious but informative,"This book would have been a lot more enjoyable if Fyfe didn't repeat himself endlessly. It read like the half-baked essay of a so-so college sophomore.Some of the information was interesting however, and I did appreciate Fyfe's ability to contextualize the events of Led Zep's existence in the world of music and otherwise. He clearly knows a lot about the music industry."
5,Easy to run and hide than RG6,It is very flexible and smaller than the usual large RG6 cable which will not bend around tight corners and stands out when surface runs are needed.
5,the best there is,This is definetly smoov e' s greatest cd and there all great. This is the best production on any smoov e cd and it has all the best songs. The reek daddy songs are off the hook and mac dre & dubee don't disapoint. King Nicky is at his best here(...). You can play it all the way through w/ skipping a single track. There are 2 instrumentals but they're sicc beats and worth listning to. Bong filled with ice G rap ain't dead and unleash the cracken are also top tracks. & playboy style.
3,Great book for Gen Xers in love,"This is an excellent book for those ready to take the premature plunge under the age of 30. However, those of us over 30 may not find his advice applicable (i.e. At 38, it's difficult to find individuals that have NOT had multiple sex partners.)An easy read, this book focuses on the many issues that should be dealt with before making a life altering decision. I would highly recommend this to my younger brother."
2,Could have been better,"I bought this book used and was disappointed by the amount of underlining I found in the book. The comments about the book that the provider gave did not specify this. Also, I found the overall content of the book disappointing. The author, I felt, spent most of the time telling about his success during his dating years avoiding bad relationships and his success in confronting dating people with his counseling. I felt he was more or less bragging on himself then actually giving practical help and advice. Some of the tests were good, but some of the information/questions were repetitive throughout the book. Definitely glad I didn't spend much money on this - I would not recommend the book, or consider rereading it."
3,Suitable but not very sturdy and lots of noise,"I purchased this item to use along with a supercardoid microphone for capturing audio with filming. The cable does everything it is supose to, it is and XLR male to female, and it fits fine. However after only 2 weeks of filming I can see that it wont stand up for too much longer. Also, the audio isnt amazing. There is alot of noise (static) sepeialy if the cord is kinked in any way.It works, just isnt great"
4,It's stll doing its job,"I've gone thru a million of these cables this one has lasted a few months without breaking. It is decent quality. I Use it for recording music with Mbox, using Protools"
3,It works but cable is flimsy,"This cable is lower priced and it shows in the quality of the cable, very flimsy and will not stand up to constant use over time, spend a little more to get better."
3,Very much acceptable... but not perfect.,"It works very well so long as the cable isn't too twisted. I had to duct-tape the cable at the part before the prong comes out to help eliminate wire buzz. It only happened when the cord wasn't coming straight out of the input jack, and bent at that ""joint""otherwise, you can't beat this for price. If you are new to the music scene, I recommend this and just deal with duct taping it to work if you have to cause it's not worth buying a more expensive one when it'll probably work fine or may just need some minor adjustments."
1,Did not work,"The connectors are not Molded ones, they are soldered and screw ones. Hence does not last, and not at all durable. This one did not work on arrival, and I had to manually fix it to get it working. The Cable itself is of very low quality, and gets too much interference when near speakers and/or other instruments."
4,Mic Cable,"The cable seems fine, yet the pic shows one in a package...This came without a package...not a big deal, but not an honest representation."
1,Disappointed after one year's light use,"Bought a pair of the cable for two SM58 microphones using in a Karaoke system. Initially was very happy for the purchases due to low cost and seemingly good quality. However, after about a dozen uses over a little more than 16 months, both pairs became loose where the cable connects the microphone. Now they are useless. Very disappointed."
3,Good for for about 5 months,"I got this with my first XLR Microphone I ever bought and now have a little personal home studio thing going on now.For the first 5 months the cable Was holding good to my Shure Beta 58A. But I started to notice that the XLR cable Female side's locking pin (what ever you would call it) was not holding right. The connection where fine as long as didn't move the mic much. I kept this wire for about 1 year and now it's time to hang it up.I would not recommended this Product for stage uses, but it's good for a temporary cheep substituted for someone that just bought expensive microphone."
3,Standard XLR cable - nothing special,The value for the quality is reasonable. It works and the connectors are wired correctly.is wired correctly. Pin 1 & 3 are crossed.
3,"Not bad to start out with, use it with my MXL 67G","Not bad for the price. Wire can be thicker and the heads can be of better quality. The heads feel a little light to me. However, I have not had any noise problem from the wire so far so good purchase for a cheap wire for cheap mic."
1,XLR 15ft,i got this mic when it was on sale for 6$...now i see why......this cable stopped working after a few weeks. i have to pull the cable to the top of the mic and hold it vary tight 4 the sound to work. if i just let it sit there like your spose to it wont work....wast of the money..6$ for the cable and 6$ for shipping....SUCKS
4,Do This come with a Microphone adapter ?,Do this mic come with an microphone adapter? I wanted to buy and i need to know if I need ti buy an adapter with it because if I dont i can just order it now I really want this mic.
3,Voltron: paradise lost dvd,It is a comic anamation cartoon. Like the old Golden book videos from the 70's & 80's. Not a bad prequel telling of the story.
4,Bed Rails,"Bought this item to cover up some damage to my bed. The extra material on the side did the trick. These are nice bed rail caps. Texture almost matches my factory tailgate cap. I went with the stake pocket holes because I work my truck but I think I'd really like the no holes caps a lot. Oh yeah, almost forgot. Amazon was almost HALF the price that Stylin' Trucks was asking"
5,If you have children a must see,"raising children is difficult in itself, but to have a special needs child is beyond difficult. If God nly gives us what we can handle doesn't he know it is enough?"
4,"Home Truth of the ""Lucky Country""","""The cars that eat Paris"" is a story of an Australian country town luring actively strangers to be robed and lost their life for a better of this semi-prison settlement of which inhabitants are free to hang around a few streets between a pub and body-works shop while de facto short of possibility to move out.""The Plumber"" is of a hippy-style handyman making idiots from a family of intellectuals interested in discussing fantasies and producing writings aka science papers with no practical outcomes for co-citizens and life surrounding. This movie conveys so many issues that better it once to watch than a dozen of reviews to read of.Produced in the seventies, both seemingly distant works have been joint with a sarcastic depiction of Australian realities as it's even much more explicitly clear recently."
4,Great Product for Beginner Robotics,"I bought two of these, probably could have saved some money by purchasing the dual motor gearboxTamiya Double Gearbox L/R Independ 4-speed TAM70168instead of two units, however I like my robot to have a wider base. The kit once built is secured to a solid piece of wood, and can be easily modified to just about any size needed. The kit is rather noisy, I'm not sure if that is due to the plastic gearboxes, or the motors.I'm powering my kits with a R/C car battery pack, andArduino MEGA 2560w/2A Motor Shield. My sensor package is quite large so the components are changing daily, however the Tamiya tracks remain the base of my project. I can't testify to how the tracks perform on carpet, on my tiled floors however it moves rather quickly."
4,Awesome Chassis,"This chassis comes with a single wheel motor. Its really cool, i switched the switch and programmed it to work with an Arduino.Works perfect, easy to assemble and come with some extra parts. It was delivered fast also."
5,The best,I have the whole amped series. It is the best work out ever. It is vigorous and versatile. I have been doing it for years now switching off between the different videos and walking somedays. Love it love it love it.
3,The title is misleading.....,"Based on the title I thought the routine would be a lot more intense instead I barely broke a sweat even on first try. However, I'm a Billy Blanks fan and I do love the energy. If you're looking to shred lbs. this may not be the right dvd for you."
3,Disappointed,"I was looking for a workout that would compare to P90X's Kenpo X workout. This DVD did not measure up. I put 20 minutes into the DVD, and my heart rate peaked at 80% of max and the average was less than 65%, and that was after I strapped on 2.5 lb weights on each wrist to duplicate the single 3 lb bar used in the DVD. In addition, even though I watched the instructional section, there was foot work in the DVD not covered in the instructions. I gave it a 3 because if you are looking for less intense workouts, this would probably be good, but if you are used to Insanity and P90X, don't bother."
3,Meh.,"I too was looking for a cardio supplement for my regular workouts. I have been doing Turbo Fire for over a year now and am bored. This workout will not give you a high heartrate and cardio results. It will, however, give you a decent full-body workout. I suggest weighted gloves if you have them. I didn't bother buying the stick- not needed. I love my Billy, but this workout fell short for what I was looking for."
5,"Love, love, love Tae Bo","I've been using tae bo on and off for years, and recently got back into it and have been doing it 4-5x/wk for the past 6 months. The results are amazing. I am toned where I've never been toned before and feel great. I have about 10 different Tae Bo videos that I switch between so I don't get bored, and I'd say Amped Full Throttle and Ripped Extreme are my favorites. I like how they both incorporate weights, so I am seeing results in my arms, a difficult area for me. I don't have the bar for Amped, but I just use light weights, and it works just as well. Definitely would recommend this video and any tae bo work out. Fun and it works if you stick to it!!"
3,Not bad at all,"Debbie looked alot better here than in the past few years.. the band hasnt lost their touch.. IT was sureal watching them perform in 2004... The one thing I didnt like was how she sang ""Call Me"". The hook ""CALL ME!"" yell was gone...it was more like she was talkin to you rather than Yelling it at you like the original.. otherwise not a bad gig at all... Worth a look.."
