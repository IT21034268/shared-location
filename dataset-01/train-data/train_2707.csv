1,Pathetic,If I could rate this movie below one star I would. It is poorly written and acted. Do not waste your time or money on this one.
1,Bad. Just bad.,The building this movie took place in is cool - but unfortunately that's the only thing worth watching. I have to admit I pretty much gave up about half-way through - I left it on but did other things while it ran in the background. Even then I didn't like it. Next time maybe I'll mute the sound and just look at the set.
1,Death Tunnel,I don't understand where the previous review came from when the movie isn't set for release until next week...Did he watch a bootleg copy? I give it at least one star for all the work that must have gone into it. I will review it for real when it is released on DVD since it was never shown in theaters.
1,SCREAMING BIMBOS,"Take five sweet looking chicks, throw them into a haunted sanatorium and add as much derivative camerawork and plotlines as you can and you get DEATH TUNNEL. Based on true events that occurred in a sanatorium in Kentucky, this movie tries to jolt us with the horrible things that happened to tuberculosis patients and their subsequent haunting of the infamous institution. It might have worked with a little more finesse and imagination, and hiring good actors. What happens makes little sense and the girls involved will not be known for their thespian skills.It's all been done a hundred times before and much better."
3,"Sick and twisted, fun!","On most levels, there's little remarkable about ""Death Tunnel."" Old scary building? Check. Scantily clad babes in distress? Check. Masked psycho goon? Check. Profanity is place of actual dialogue? Partial check. Befuddled conclusion? Yeppers.On the positive side, for an independent low budget film, the production value is very good. The special effects are impressive, and the acting isn't too bad either. What I do fault is the editing and direction. While the opening sequence and credits were well done, the herky-jerky flashbacks and foreflashes are confusing and annoying. The ending is also confusing as well.This is a bright spot of the DVD. Check out the special features and the mini-documentary on the Waverly Hill Santarium, where the movie was filmed. The true history of this historic site will amaze and terrify you. The filmmakers were especially clever to incorporate actual EVP and ghost footage into the movie."
3,Frustrating and disappointing,"I am sorry, but I found this book to be very confusing and incomplete in some ways. As a 4th year MT student, this text was very disjointed. Things were never where I, and logic, would have placed things. I was constantly having to go back to the index or table of contents to find information that should have been right where I was. Information seemed incomplete, too much about the genetics, and not enough about the day to day significance of specific antibody/antigens. A nice chart or two would have been nice, one that had all the RBC antigens on it. The chapter on Rh was incoherent...especially when trying to cover the Fischer Race schemes, as well as the chapter on secretors. This text was extremely frustrating to use.Bailey, BS MT(ASCP)"
1,Extremely inconvenienced,"I never recieved the book. Because I was notified a week later,I was delayed applying for my certification, and lost an excellent employment opportunity. I had to look elsewhere for the book. I do not believe I will be making purchases in the future, unless it was absolutely necessary."
4,The essence of Captain Kidd,"This was a light hearted chronical of the exploits of the notorious Captain Kidd. Our children have been learning about him in school. While the dialog was a bit hard to follow, and there were a few historical inconsistencies, it gave them a sense of how people dressed, what the ships looked like etc. Lots of fun to watch."
2,DisneyMania 4 fails to deliver-- Don't waste your money,"I usually love Disney pop, no matter how enhanced the performers' voices are (which is usually the case, since Disney uses actors with lots of appeal and only marginal vocal talent), but this ranks as one of the most inane, bland compilations.The only songs worth listening to are ""A Dream Is a Wish"" (which is carried by the talented Raven and Alyson Michalka) and ""If I Never Knew You"" by the Cheetah Girls.The worst songs are ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" (Tisdale has a terrible voice, and this version of the song is constructed poorly), and Miley Cyrus's rendition of ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,"" which is too slow to be enjoyable."
5,A DREAM,"I loved this CD and I was looking for one song, A DREAM IS A WISH YOUR HEART MAKES, because i saw it on disney channel and thought it was awesome but along with that i found a whole heap of other songs like the Yo-Ho one which i worked out is what the main pirate i forgot his name but it's Johnny Depp said it when they were on the island in Pirates of the Carribian The Black Pearl (Number 1).Elvie,14"
4,Second Best in Disney Mania Series,"Don't get me wrong; I loved listening to this CD, especially to the Disney Channel Stars singing A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes. I remember seeing the music video for it when they first made it on the Disney Channel. B5's Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf (which also has a bonus music video) is EXCELLENT in my opinion! I love how they 'spiced it up.' Great job on their part.The thing that was missing (or group I should say) is Jump 5. They were one the previous Disney Mania CDs, but for some reason, were left out of this one. That is really the only downside to the CD. Other than that, if you liked the other Disney Mania CDs, I recommend this! The songs have upbeat melodies and are enjoyable to listen to."
4,4 Stars For Disneymania 4,"In a way, this cd is good, and in a way, it's bad.""Disneymania 4"" definately isn't the best in the ""Disneymania"" series, but isn't the worst either.I think Disney messed up with songs like ""Supercalafragilisticexpealidocious""(turining it into a rap), ""Bahama Roller Coaster Ride""(which isn't even a Disney song, it's supposed to be Hawainn, not Bahama), and ""Monkey's Uncle""(Which Disney actually allowed a pathetic youngster group like Devo 2.0 sing).Some of the better songs are ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"", ""Zip A Dee Doo Dah"", ""Look Through My Eyes"", ""You'll Be In My Heart"", and ""If I Never Knew You"".I wouldn't highly reccomend this cd, but for absolutely HUGE fans of the Disneymania series, they might want this."
4,New Beats From Old Songs!,"I absolutely LOVE this cd! I recommend track 1. A Dream is a Wish Your Hearts Makes by the Disney Channel Circle of Stars! I think it's really cool how they included the star of Disney Channel's newest show(Hannah Montana)Miley Cyrus! It's definantly worth your money. :D Like I said in the Title, this cd makes new beats from old songs!"
4,"Good,But Not Great","It`s a good cd but not a wonderful cd. It has it`s succeses,and failures. Here is the catagories and what songs I think go under them:THE GREAT:A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes- Disney Channel StarsZip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah - Miley CyrusReflection(Remix)- Christina AguliaraI'll Try- Jesse MccartneySomeday My Prince Will Come- Ashley TisdaleCan You Feel The Love Tonight- Sara PaxtonTHE GOOD/OK:Who's Afraid Of The Big Bad Wolf- B5If I Never Knew You- The Cheetah GirlsLook Through My Eyes- EverlifeYou'll Be In My Heart- Teddy GeigerThe Pretty Bad:Candle On The Water- Analiese Van Der PolBahama Roller Coaster Ride- Baha MenMonkey's Uncle- Devo 2.0The HORRID:Super Cali(BoIB Version)- Orlando BrownIt's a cool cd,but it isn`t the best in the series.Maybe if there's ever a Disneymania 5 it will be better."
4,Five year olds love it!,"I purchased Disneymania, Vol 4 for my daugher's fifth birthday and she loves it. She is a big fan of the Disney Channel and Radio Disney so most of the songs were very familiar to her. But, heed this warning, be prepared to have the cd requested EVERY TIME you drive anywhere."
3,Its ok but not all that,The Disney Mania 4 cd is ok i guess. There is only one song in my opinion that is awesome and worth listening to. That song is Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf by B5. They made the song more worth while with Kelly Breeding's rap skills and Bryan Breeding's vocals. So would I recommened this cd well its perfect if you are only going to listen to the one song i recommened other than that it is like ok I guess.
4,for the any1 into Disney,It has some decent songs on the cd among them:A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes - Disney Channel StarsIf I Never Knew You - Cheetah Girls (its cool)Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf - B5 (pretty nice update to it/check out vid attached as well)Christina Aguilera - Reflection (Remix)I'll Try - Jesse McCartneyLook Through My Eyes - EverlifeYou'll Be In My Heart - Teddy Geigerdidnt really care for the majority of the stuff personally. It might work for some other people. But i really wasnt into them especially not song 13. I really could've done without that one altogether personally.But there are more than enough good songs on the CD and is a decent purchase.
5,All-time Favorite Boxed Set,"A fantastic birthday gift from my daughter, Nichola, who isn't a Conway Twitty fan. On the other hand, I consider it to be a wonderful tribute to Conway's music. Great enlightenment for those of us not familiar with his early recordings. No one can compare with his redition of these songs. May his music live on forever. I have used our family trips to expose my family to not only Conway's music, but other superb country artists as well. I rate this boxed collection right up there with Merle and Marty."
5,Conway Twitty Collection,This is the greatest collection of so many great songs. Hours of enjoyable music. The collection also includes many hits with the great Loretta Lynn.
5,Great,"I saw Youtube Gurus rave about this product and how effectively it blended foundations, concealer and creams.I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try.All i can say its an amazing product.My foundation looked flawless like a make up artist had done my make up.Only downside is that it stains, so make sure you clean it often."
4,The Beauty Blenders are AMAZING!!!,At first I was saying to myself they look MUCH smaller than I imagined but when they're damp they expand... it applies makeup so smooth and the right amount just soaks in for that flawless look
5,Must have beauty tool for your makeup bag,"Great product, especially for liquid foundation and cream blushes. I also use it with my MAC paint pots if they are a little dry. I get even coverage and no little hairs from my brushes now that I use the blender only. This is not your typical makeup sponge.Definitely wet the sponge before using and clean after every use. Mine is stained but I know it is clean when the water runs clear.Would purchase again in a heartbeat. :-)"
5,spongy nice,The beauty blender was all i heard it would be. it allows your makeup to go on smoothly and without lines. I just recently purchased the pure sponge as well. And the cleanser is fabulous. Cleans brushes as well. Keeps all your cleaning tools on point!
4,Awesome,I can't believe I'm just now learning about the Beauty Blender! I first read about it on a make-up website I use and had been contemplating buying one for some time. I finally bit the bullet and bought the Beauty Blender 2 + Blender Cleanser combo and I love it!! It spreads my foundation evenly over my face and makes me look dewy. I no longer have make-up all over my hands after application. The sponge is easy to clean and the cleanser works on brushes too. Love this product will never be without again!
5,"High Hopes, Higher Performance!","I am loving this beyond words! I use a liquid foundation and have very fair skin, so lines are a bit easy to see if I leave them on my face. This sponge is a wonder tool, no lines, supper soft, and easy to use. It cuts down on time in the morning for me and helps me avoid the 4 different brushes I normally use. This is an all-in-one tool that is great for a air brushed finish! =D couldn't be happier it was worth the splurge!"
4,Good Sponge. Not amazing.,"After reading and watching many reviews, I finally splurged and got this sponge. My foundation application before was done by drug store sponges and lancome sponges. And truthfully.. results are identical. But what I've found with the BB is that I can also put on powers as well and not change to a brush. In addition, application is much faster. For those who are complaining about the dye running, I've noticed this running only occurs with certain soaps. When i first washed with the BB soap there was absolutely no running of dye. However the next day I experimented with a different soap and wow so much pink came out. Certain soaps are just more potent in grabbing the dye along with the makeup. Nonetheless, it is a good sponge, and will be used till it can apply foundation no more. However I will most likely not repurchase, mainly due to the price."
2,Not Worth It!,"I bought the beautyblender due to all the good reviews on youtube.I personally preferred regular sponges. Unless I dont know how touse this, even though I've watch videos that shows you how to use it.And it's too expensive! Not worth it!"
1,never got the item I ordered.,"I ordered this item 3 or four times, each time I got the same item and each time the item was wrong, it is suppose to have a spray unit in it but it didn't come the way it is pictured."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!,"I am completley amazed with this product. I can honestly say that this is hands down the best product to apply foundation, cream blush, concealer, and pretty much any other formula. The Beauty Blender is easy to use and creates the most flawless application. I wear this mostly to apply my foundation and my concealer. I have also used it to apply cream blushes and I love it. I can't see myself applying my foundation/concealer any other way EVER again. Do not hesitiate to buy this product. This is the best beauty investment i have ever made. Thanks Amazon=)"
5,Works well for natural coverage with less foundation!,"This is my second purchase of a Beautyblender, it's really great for getting the right coverage with oily foundations, especially drugstore foundations. I found that it does give more natural coverage than using brushes. But it is not as travel friendly as a makeup brush.However with drier foundations (for summertime, I usually use oil-free), it can be harder to get the foundation off of the Beautyblender and onto your face. Most of it will get soaked up by the Beautyblender.The cleanser works well, however you want to make sure that you don't use too much and dry out your Beautyblender, so think of it more as spot cleaning than trying to soak the entire thing in soap.Highly recommended, well worth the money!"
1,Received something different!,The cleanser I received didn't come with the dispenser head as shown in the picture. The bottle is stiff and it's hard to squeeze the cleanser out. I would be happy if it came with the dispenser. Unhappy!
4,So much better than latex sponges,"If you prefer to apply your foundation with a sponge, you can't do much better than this one. I've recently switched from latex sponges to the beautyblender and I'm happy I did. I get a much more airbrushed look without wasting too much product. To minimize the loss, I apply foundation to my face with a brush, then use the beautyblender to stipple it onto my skin. Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had any issues with dye coming out of the sponge, though the cleaner doesn't 100% get the sponge clean. Clean enough though. It smells a little funny but that's not the end of the world. What annoyed me is that mine didn't come with the plastic stand to dry the sponge on. I had to save the insert of the plastic box and I've been using that as a ""pedestal"" of sorts. Otherwise, no real complaints."
4,"Works well, smells good","I had tried many other soaps before this one to clean my beauty blander but this one is by far the best. It really cleans and doesn't leave residue. It also has a nice scent, smells like lavender and tea tree."
3,"good shape, too much makeup","The shape of these sponges is perfect for the application of makeup, but I always tend to end up with too much makeup on when I use it."
5,Beautyblender and Blendercleanser Combo,These beauty blenders are great for applying make up. Using them my make up goes on a lot smoother and lighter. It is also convenient that it comes with the cleanser which smells good. I actually use this cleanser for my brushes also. A little tiny bit of this cleanser goes a long way.
4,Love it!,"Never used a blending sponge before, so I was a little reluctant to buy this. After reading tons of reviews, I went for it and am so happy I did. Very easy to use and the cleanser works great on brushes as well."
3,Not worth it for me,It's better than a brush but I found it just ok. I saw some cheaper versions in Marshall's and I was very disappointed. Not worth the money to me. They have cheaper ones on CVS and other stores.
4,beauty blender,"the beauty blender is a great sponge for foundation. i really like it, but i dont see what all the fuss is about (its not life changing). its probably one of the the best beauty tools ive used, but the price is definitly a splurge. if it were less expensive i would give it 5 stars."
5,use it everyday!,"It works so well evening out your makeup! I use it every time i need to put base on or even concealer, it makes it look like your makeup is effortless!"
4,Exquisite...,Exquisite text and images make this a great hit with the two-year set. Be prepared for repeated readings/retellings.
4,Fantastic!!!!,This is a great story with delightful illustrations. I read it to my 2 year old every day and he loves it.
5,My 4 1/2 year old has this memorized!,"We LOVE this book! What a delight to hear my daughter ""reading"" this book to herself! Not only does she enjoy the repeated text (""Little Babaji, I'm going to eat you up!...""), but the pictures put us into stitches (those wonderful tiger expressions).Like so many of the reviewers here, I was a Little Black Sambo fan as a child, and was so disappointed when I could not share this wonderful literature with my children. (Of course it is an unacceptable book - I see it now - but my siblings and I loved it!)But the Story of Little Babaji is an excellent equal, and in fact is even better.I highly recommend the Story of Little Babaji!"
3,a good book,"The book has lots of black and white photos of bonsai plants, tools, pots, and how to deal with pests. It's a good book for bonsai though the pricing info will be out of date since it's a 1975 book."
3,good book,"The book has lots of black and white photos of bonsai plants, tools, pots, and how to deal with pests. It's a good book for bonsai though the pricing info will be out of date since it's a 1975 book."
4,Its a good guide,"A very good guide, great reference for that era of doll collecting, It could use more of a ""condition"" guide for pricing."
1,Not like they used to be,"I've bought several of these over the years, but these were not like the ones that I'd seen in stores. They're made of a lighter, cheaper plastic that feels like it's going to break, and the microfiber cloth is terrible quality. Make sure you hold out for the real thing; these are an overpriced knock-off that don't work half as well as the original"
5,These really do work!,"These cleaners are the most convenient things to have around. I've got one on my key chain, one in the SUV, one at work, and one by the computer. It's not necessary to spray your glasses with any type of cleaner; these are fine when used dry. They are easy to clean; just warm water and soap, press the pads against a towel to get rid of the excess water, then let them sit until the pads are fully dry."
1,Not as expected!,I have tried one I bought from a store in London similar to this one and it cleans really good. But this one does not clean good. The material is cheap. I don't like it. I would't recommend it to any body.
4,A kids book.,I bought this on the one review available. I should have paid attention to the number of pages this book has since that would have clued me in that this book is for youth. If you're looking for something in-depth you'll be better off without this one.
2,Detention,"The dvd arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I would highly recommend this seller to other Amazon customers. The movie itself was garbage. One really never expects TOO much from a movie such as this, but in was weird, scattered, confusing and detached."
4,Entertaining Parody of Teen Movies,"I had this one recommended to me, and I ended up laughing at the quick dialog and crazy antics. The movie does stumble around somewhat, but it feels like it was done on purpose to be as out there as possible.The movie is a mash-up of slasher/teen comedies/sci-fi/action. It draws on elements from a wide variety of movies and pokes fun of them along the way. There is plenty of fake blood, some nudity, and plenty of references to sex and other more adult content.I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes movies like Scary Movie and other good parodies. Be prepared to get a little lost along the way!"
5,my absolute favorite,"quirky. rad. funny. exciting. everything i want in a 90's-obsessed teen movie. backstreets back, alright. if fast-paced, out-there plots don't suit you, i understand. but for anyone eager to watch a high-energy, absurdest film with stereotypical teen-angst plugged in, rent this for movie night."
5,Mind-Bending Masterpiece,"I absolutely adore this movie. There were times that were admittedly exhausting, and a bit off-putting, but Joseph Kahn's ""Detention"" is one of the most engaging, original, and effective movie I've seen in years. Despite very little attendance for its theatrical run, I believe that this film will has a happy cult run. It's smart, bizarre, funny, shocking, bloody, sexy, and all around charming. I must say, though, some ppl will be turned off by its ADD, blink-and-you'll-miss-it style, but for those able to keep up you'll no doubt have a blast. One of my favorite films in years."
4,A darn good attempt at something fresh!,"Someone may have bitten off a little more than they could chew here, basically parodying ALL genres and sub-genres of film; HOWEVER, they do a pretty good job of pulling it off most of the time. Definitely worth a first watch, at least!"
1,HIGH SCHOOL HIJINKS DON'T CUT IT FOR ME,"With all due respect to my fellow reviewers, I just didn't enjoy DETENTION. Yes it attempts to be original, blending horror, comedy and social commentary. In my opinion, however, the movie throws in so many ingredients that it results in a real mess. Time travel, alien abduction, serial killer from a slasher movie, etc. never really congeal into any sense of coherence. Performances are appropriately campy but as usual, the actors appear to be in their twenties. I ultimately lost interest halfway through and only finished watching in hope that it would come to a logical resolution...but for me, it just didn't. I can't recommend DETENTION."
2,Dane Cook Fan...Detention? Not So Much.,"Detention apparently was made for the teenage viewers.Being middle age I felt it to be very familiar and predictable.For years I have enjoyed Dane Cooks comedy,owning all his CD/DVDs.His acting career is as respectable.Unfortunately he has a small part in this movie.So if your watching this to see Dane Cook, you could be very disappointed."
2,movie sucked,this movie was not worth the time or money spent on it. i cant recommend this title to anyone i know.
3,Eh,"Detention was an okay movie in the ""so stupid it's funny"" kind of way. I gotta say I just watched it because Josh Hutcherson was in it, if he was the main character I would've liked it better, but that's just me. I wouldn't rent it again though."
4,Pretty Good,This movie was okay but was not really something I am in to. It was funny at parts but I think it gets carried away and a bit confusing towards the end.
4,Amazing for the right audience,"Joseph Kahn is a cinematic madman. I adore his previous film TORQUE- it is an underrated action movie deconstruction that actually works as the genre it is taking to task. DETENTION has scenes that absolutely blew me away, but I do recognize that it isn't made for everyone. Having said that, not making a movie for EVERYONE should really be applauded. Most movies are predictable and generic, but those terms could NEVER be used to describe DETENTION.The acting is top notch- seriously all of the kids are great (and actually LOOK like high school kids) The football coach is played with sublime genius by James Black.Seriously, if you love cinema, you owe it to yourself to see DETENTION. If you are uncertain about it, rent it. But if you appreciate a visionary director going off the deep end- making a comedy/horror/I-don't-want-to-spoil-it/Can't-even-describe-it masterpiece, then this is a must own disc. I only hope there are commentary tracks galore."
2,Strange movie,"Movie was incredibly strange, was similar to Jennifer's body if you liked that one. I would not see it again."
1,Horrible...,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wish I could get that time back...I'm a little more dumb now for having seen it. I wish I could use that bear time machine to go back and stop myself from renting this movie.
3,"I Loved Half Of It, But Hated The Other Half","Detention has a great start, with amazing gore, a kick-ass killer, and some clever humor. However, and coincidentally, the movie becomes a big mess once several students get detention. Then the film gets really confusing and headache-inducing. Worth watching once, but I wouldn't watch it again just for some great death sequences and some funny lines when the movie as a whole isn't great."
1,detention,"terrible wanted to throw up durring the entire show. I didnt want to watch it, but had already spent the money on it...for some reason it got good reviews. I have no idea why"
1,Simpsons Did it.....,"After hearing all of the positive hype, I had to check this out and was very disappointed. Ok now, really? This movie is a poorly done ripoff of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (self awareness, obvious contrived dialog, etc) with a Scream storyline inserted where Scott Pilgrim had video games. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World pulled it off with good acting and a creative/fun arcade spin. Where is this movie creative or different in a way that doesnt ripoff something else? This does not deserve these high reviews. It's not Heathers....it's not Mean Girls....it's not even Scream...it's just bad..period."
2,Wanted To Like It ... But Just Couldn't,"I am a big fan of movies like Scary Movie (first one only) and Severance, horror movies which are skewered to poke fun at their own genre to produce a very funny, without being insulting, horror parody. I THINK the makers of this film intended to do the same thing, but failed. Lot's of elements of The Faculty, Scream, Jennifer's Body, Ferris Bueller, Donnie Darko, etc., in fact so many elements of so many movies, that it contains no single cohesive story element at all and comes off as sloppy and amateurish. I was very disappointed, too, cuz I was hoping for a great film. I read the reviews, went with my gut (and the very slick preview) and was proved wrong on all counts. I would not recommend this film to anyone, definitely not as a purchase. Free would be -- okay."
4,heathers plus speed = a lot of fun,"I had a blast watching this. There are references to everything in your whole life (as long as you're not over 40). What is interesting is that while the movie is very direct about all those references and teen movies it satires, it never mentions the one it most reminds me of - the classic Heathers. Anyway,if you're too young to have known and loved Heathers,if you enjoyed watching Michael Cera battling deadly exes, chances are you'll get a kick out of this flick as well."
3,self,I seen the previews and it looked like a good movie. I wached it and really didn't care for it. I gave it to my nephew.
2,Teenybopper Comedy/Horror,"Detention just was not for me, I made it through the entire movie but it was hard. Almost turned it off several times. Maybe I just am not in the age group this movie was filmed for, (I'm 29). Only thing saving this movie from getting 1 star is it has a couple pretty cool kill scenes, the characters in this movie annoyed me so bad it was nice to see them get killed off. So only I would only recomend this movie to kids in middle school or high school, anyone older will prob feel the same way I did."
2,Out there,"I only watched this movie because Dane can be funny from time to time and because I know someone who helped make this movie. But basically, this movie was terrible, it made no sense whatsoever and didn't make me laugh or anything. After the first 10 minutes I was hoping it end so I could start the rest of my life without the set back of watching this movie."
5,Funniest movie in a loooong time.,This movie was absolutely hilarious. I don't think it is for all personality types at all though. It has a very dark and satirical humor to it. It is super witty and a movie that I will definitely watch over and over again.
1,"Should work OK, but Not returnable to Amazon.com","Heal Cups are a Hit or Miss item. Either it works or it doesn't work for you. I ordered three different ones (classic, gel, heavy duty) for my son to use. He tried the regular ""classic"" ones. It seems to work ok, but he decided he did not like how it feels and stopped wearing it, claims the pain went away.I tried returning the other two unused ones, but found out they are classified as personal items, and are NOT returnable!!! Buyer beware, these are not like shoes that are returnable, even when new.3 stars for the item, minus 2 stars for Amazon return policy for this item."
5,Great product at reasonable price,"Since I have plantar fasciitis my physician suggested I get Tuli heel cups. Having failed to find them locally,I went online. In my search I discovered that other heel cups did not have the honeycomb construction on the underside of the heel cup that the Tuli brand did. This feature seemed to make more sense to me making them more cushioney, so I purchased them and have been very satisfied. They are made of a flexible gel material that can easily be cleaned under running water. They are just inserted into any shoe and do not need to be adhered to the sole in any manner which allows me to transfer them between shoes. The price was very reasonable and I would definitely buy them again. As long as my condition persists, I shall be using them in my shoes.Tuli's Classic Gel Heel Cups - Regular (under 175 lbs)"
3,"its not bad, but it dosn't stick under your heel","its not bad, but it dosn't stick under your heel .... it give u a good feeling if you have pain or you stand up for long time, but it will not stay in place if you wearing a sandal or slipper, but it would if you wear a boots or shose. sometimes, i feel that it's not fit right, it helps a little bit."
4,Great Product!,My doctor recommended these for heel pain that I was suffering from. They have been great. The constant pain was almost immediately alleviated.
3,An Okay Product...,"I recently purchased these heel cups on the recommendation of a podiatrist. I was having foot problems due to training for the 40-mile Avon Walk; I was getting a repeat blister on the inside of my right heel. The podiatrist recommended these to help my thin heels fit better into the shoes. It did help enough to allow me to finish the event, but I did still get a blister on day one (26.2 miles). I am rating them as just ""okay"" because they helped a little bit but not completely. Also I don't feel that they offered a lot of extra cushioning on the bottom of my heel--I feel there are other ""gel"" products out there that are a lot more useful if you are looking for heel cushioning (such as Sof Sole)."
2,It works but not great,I weigh 135 lbs and I purchase the heel cups for 2 purposes: reduce impact to heel and to reduce friction causing calluses around the heels. I found this product a bit too flimsy. The impact reduction is minimal but it does work on reducing calluses.
3,Comfortable but squeaky!,"I am wearing the Tuli's Classic Gel Heel Cups for the first time today. They are comfortable but didn't blow me away. Unfortunately, I am wearing them at work and they squeak every time I step on my heel (due to air between my heel and the heel cup being pushed out when my heel strikes)! It's actually pretty embarrassing and I'll probably have to take them out. Has anyone else had this problem? Maybe I should put powder on my feet?"
4,Work great!,I use these to cover a heel spur. Works great and makes ballet flats a little more comfortable. They do get a little dirty though.
4,Good comfort for regular activity,Good comfort for regular activity. Generally not noticeable in my dress shoes or my daily wear sneakers. Do not seem to move/shift once the shoe is on.
2,My Doctor asked that I order this product.,"I had bruised by heel while working on the tractor in the field. I was asked to try this product to give me a little more support in my shoes. I find that it too much in the shoe and causes my toes to wadge in the from of the shoes off setting the good that it does to help soften the heel. If I had a larger shoe, say a half size bigger, waybe it would work just fine."
2,Made Well but didn't help,This product didn't help my plantar fasciitis at all. There is a thicker one that helped slightly but still not very well.
2,Not very helpful,The gel heel cups fit but just add to the heel pain. I have found a better alternative at the drugstore.
5,A Thousand Memories,Rhett's first album and the best of his 3 the others are great to. Seen Rhett at Billy Bobs several times and he can put on one hell of a show..
4,this disc BUMPS,"Knowing that his career was on borrowed-time, Rhett Akins remixed the entire album with hot hip hop producers. The result is the bootleg disc circulating in Europe as well as in and around the Southeastern United States.P diddy (?) guests on Rhett's joint entitled ""Yo That Aint My Escalade"" (that aint my truck), and lil Joe shows up on 69 memories.check it out"
5,A storehouse of both history and horicultural practices,"I am affiliated with a large strawberry grower and have had more than a passing acquaintance with Victor Voth. Mr. Handcock's work is so rich in strawberry history, horticulture and other useful information that I have been unable to put it down. I recommend it to Grower and shipper/packers alike for facinating reading..."
3,"Adequate, but nothing original","I anticipated a great book from Solomon, who writes a weekly antiwar column. I have to say his book is a mild disappointment. There's nothing terribly original about it. It's pretty much a well-known fact that Bush lied about Iraq's WMD programs in 2002-3 and that LBJ lied about the Gulf of Tonkin incidents.Yes, most of us concerned citizens know the media, especially during wartime, is heavily controlled by the federal government. Walter Karp and Rick McArthur covered this theme many years ago. War Made easy basically echoes what they and other antiwar authors have already said. One other example of a better book about wars and deceit is Eric Alterman's When Presidents Lie. If you've read nothing on the subject, Solomon is OK, but I would read these other authors first."
2,Why stop there?,Why doesn't Solomon write about all the lies that lead up to American involvment in WWI and WWII?Why start in 1965?Americans were being lied into wars long before 1965.You could make an argument that except for the Revolution we have been lied unto every war we have been in.
5,NORMAN SOLOMON CALLS A SPADE A SPACE,"If you are proud of America, and have an open mind, you may comeaway from this book with second thoughts. If you are not proud of America, you will get plenty of support from Norman Solomon.War Made Easy documents with penetrating facts and boldness the unnecessary wars and misadventures that our leaders have gotten this country into since the end of World War II.What is just as frightening is the role of complicity played by the media, repeating the lies told to the American people over and over, including our present nightmare in Iraq.If there is any silver lining at all, it's that Norman Solomonhas the freedom to speak his mind, and tell us what many of usthink but have not dared to say, namely that America has lost its way."
4,Tricep Rope,It works great. Only negative comment is that it is a little expensive for a piece of rope. The quality is good though.
5,Classic Daniela.,Warm & sensual. This is Daniela's foray into a much more mature adult contemporary sound. Daniela's unique voice (one that a lot of people seem quite dived on) works extremely well with the simple and minimalistic music that fills the record.
2,Fast but Fragile,"This car is fast and sticks to the road like glue. The battery drains quickly, though. Battery access requires a screwdriver, unlike similar products. Minus on accessibility. The internal steering mechanism has already sheered a gear. The gears are plastic, no surprise, but I have other RCs that never had this problem and are still going strong after several years. I'm currently trying to find replacement parts. No luck yet. So it still goes fast, only in a straight line."
3,i love this toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i just reveced this for my 13th birthday i am a huge bratz fan i also got the baby yasmen they r sooo cute u can put the blanket in the carreg and use it as a bed.u also can store the diper bag in the trunk.the little froggy fits right in the front with the doll i luve bratz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
5,cant wait till xmas!,MY mum lybyed this toy for me for xmas with bratz babyz yasmin.I already have cloe.this toy looks seriousley awsome.
4,Slightly Illogical Collection,I don't have any complaints about this collection- except it doesn't include All My Sons. Which just seems illogical to me.
5,EVERYTHING,"You have two options, buy all his plays for 12.95 and up, or buy this with all his plays. This is the best book of plays I could have picked up."
1,Bedtime stories Consultants read their Children,"I have the 2nd edition of Block's ""Flawless"" and find it an essential reference, true to its reputation. Disappointingly in this Companion many of the authors seem to treat the readers as a captive audience - at the level of first year college students. For example - a diatribe on Romeo and Juliet as an illustration of human diversity, or three pages of ""my worse experiences"" one of which transpired to be freezing on stage and losing the point. These type of chapters annoyed me and distracted me from some of the worthy contributions. So much so that I returned the book to the bookshop and asked for my money back - the first time I have done so in 30 years of buying management books. In my opinion this book is a dud riding on the coat tails of the previous 'flawless' success."
5,Best Consulting Book in a Long Time - Suitable for both External and Internal Consultants,"I cannot say enough about the depth, accuracy and inventiveness of the material in this book. As a consultant internally and externally to organizations for decades, I use this book in my work and as a resource when I teach coaches and consultants. Packed with examples and strategies that work!"
5,"Minimum skills required of review ""writer""-->Valdez Ladd","People in glass houses shouldn't throw rocks. One would expect people providing criticisms of written works have the ability themselves to construct at least a single grammatical sentence.The ""dating"" of the book should come as no surprise to individuals who check what operating systems it covers before purchasing it."
3,Disappointing and Dull,"I almost put it down after the first two chapters. I tried to like it--several other women had recommended it to me, and I didn't want to go back to them and say that I hadn't finished it. I won't recommend it to anyone else.Has this writer never heard of the most famous adage in fiction, ""show, don't tell""? If you have to belabor a point, or constantly tell the reader the backstory in lengthy paragraphs that go nowhere, then you aren't doing your job as a writer.The reader should be able to infer from a well-crafted work what you haven't told them.The dialogue is stilted and the ""epiphanies"" aren't.Many book clubs have chosen this one for their members, and its reputation appears to be growing. I don't quite understand how.This reads like a first effort, from someone who was published well before they were ready. It's not horrible, but it's not praiseworthy in my opinion, either."
2,Family reunion redux,"Engagingly written and populated with real characters, I wanted to ""like"" this book. Unfortunately, it felt overly forumulaic in the sense that it reads like too many of its forerunners: a stimulus for a family to go home for a reunion, all members with their predictable crisis and secrets, marital strife, single pregnant woman, recently disabled man, the overdone lesson that you can't go home... Not to put down a sophisticated narrative and emotional achievement, but I've read this story a hundred times."
1,Do phans really need this?,"I couldn't help but notice this is the 5th best selling CD in the Phish section and I couldn't help but wonder do phans really need this? Most Phish heads could tell you the band's history, a complete summary of gamehenge, as well as million other minor details not mentioned on the cd off the top of their head. So why waste 12 dollars on a narrative cd that contains none of the Band's tunes? That's being read by someone who has less to do with Phish than the people buying the album. If your clueless about Phish the F.A.Q. section of phish.net is an invaluable resource that will give you up to 100 times the information for free. Or click over to phish.com for an official history of the band in the section fittingly titled ""The Band"". In summary please don't contribute to someone trying to leech of the success and beauty of Phish."
1,NO PHISH HERE,THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT ==== WARNING THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PHISH MUSIC ON THIS CD.
4,call for more of the native music on nx,"nx is a really great collection of music, but I would like to hear more of the native peoples' music that they played in the series."
5,RADIO STATION KBHR FAN FROM DOWNUNDER,"If you enjoyed the show,you will love this cd,I have always been a fan of the music (Chris) the best DJ in CICELY Alaska, played in the series,he always amazed me with his choice of music.. sometimes strange but always compelling....love it....a must buy if you loved the series"
4,More music from Northern Exposure - review,"Additional selected music from the series not included on the first music CD. Most music is ecclectic in a good way, available elsewhere but difficult to assemble together, an overall pleasing selection. A few selections are Native American songs, and original music scores from the producer's musicians that wrote the theme song. This CD includes the 45-second version of the theme song -- that is the version length that is heard at the beginning of each episode."
1,More Music from NX,Didn't buy the CD because I wanted more of the Native American music and chants that were used on NX. It's easy to find the pop music featured on the CD. At least give us the list of Native American songs and artists that were featured. Then I'll know what other CD's to look for.
2,Only use for thick fluids,"Whatever you do, don't try to use these squeeze bottles for thin liquids---they leak around the top every time you turn them over to use them, shake them up, etc. A particularly thick sauce should work fine. I also don't really like the little red stoppers---they're so tiny they're very easy to drop and lose."
5,classic Jams,"talk about a fun and feel Good Band? KC and the sunshine band had the kind of cuts and Grooves that just made you feel good and you just vibed. that's the way I like it, shake your booty, please don't don't go,I'm your Boogie Man,etc... still stand the test of time. it is music that brings a smile across my face after all of these years. classic songs and KC brought the musical flavor and thensome."
4,Track list,This applies to Rhino's CD number 70940.The track list is:1. Sound Your Funky Horn2. Get Down Tonight3. I'm Your Boogie Man4. Shake Your Booty5. Queen of Clubs6. That's the Way7. Keep It Coming Love8. Please Don't Go9. Boogie Shoes10. Let's Go Rock and Roll11. Give It Up12. Do You Wanna Go Party13. I Like to Do It14. Shotgun Shuffle15. Wrap Your Arms Around Me16. All I Want
3,Solid,"I bought this book because I am learning to play the guitar and wanted chords for some songs that I know, but couldn't find on-line chord charts for. The on-line chord chart world is a bit skimpy when it comes to traditional hymns. Hymnbooks are useless for beginning guitar.This book is not necessarily the best value for a beginning guitar player. I've marked seven songs as being ""worth the effort to learn at this level of skill"" (nets to $2/song, which is cheaper than buying sheet music). Not too shabby. Presuming my skill increases, I'll be able to master at a whole lot more; there's also a lot to be said for having the melody line available (instead of a chord-chart-only) so I can work out the tricky bits of a tune I don't quite remember.Elsewise, solid format, nice layout, like that it spreads flat on the couch and I don't need clips to hold the book open where I'm playing (or to crack the spine permanently).I'm not unhappy with the purchase."
5,Reader's Digest Lift Every Voice and Sing,The first copy sent was missing the lyrics booklet. Amazon rushed a replacement copy to me quickly and it came in perfect condition.
4,Excellent Keychain,"This item is great. Well manufactured. I have put it through alot in the short time that I have had it. It is definatly a must for any true FMA fan. I get questions about it all the time, and I gladly tell them about the show. f they could somehow figure out how to put one of those small keyfinders in it, AWESOME!"
3,Not sure about this one yet,"I am a loyal user of Pureology shampoos and conditioners, but this is the first time I've tried this particular product. I've seen a lot of good reviews on here and a couple other sites that sell this product, but so far, haven't seen the results I expected. It's possible I rush doing my hair in the morning and haven't really taken the time to use this product like it's supposed to be used. So far, I'm disappointed, but will keep trying and will continue to buy other products from this brand."
2,out of control,"I have very thin, fine hair and thought that the pureology products were a good idea. Unfortunately, I have found that it leaves my hair very dry and full of static. Sorry, but I think I will go back to my tried and true Redken BodyFull line."
2,Expected more,"Love the brand and expected more from this product...oh well, guess that is why it was on sale real cheap. The amplifier makes my fine hair feel sticky and coarse when first applied and that feeling doesn't change while blow drying. I have a short, layered cut to give baby fine hair some boost and wanted a product that maintained lift and shine to the hair after blowdrying. Definitely not the right product choice if you have fine hair."
4,short and sweet,"this album is really good, it has ivy queen, don omar, and daddy yankee etc..it's just too short! but all the songs are good to dance to and blend together well"
3,Why I brought this dictionary,My son needed this dictionary for school. We like the print. We were happy to find it online at Amazon. The book got to the house really fast.
5,Great value for 4 DVD's,"Cheaper than buying separately for sure.My 21 month old LOVES these videos. They're very entertaining and she seems to enjoy interacting with it...we sit together and watch and she watches alone, too. I don't think there is any problem with her watching programs like this, it's fine, my husband and I watch TV so it's unrealistic to have NO TV in the home. In any case, the videos are all a big hit with her, she just loves them and I actually like them more than Baby Einstein. Plus they don't have those annoying repetitive intros and 2 menus every time I put one in!!!!!"
1,More of a babysitter than a teaching tool,"Although well meaning, the brainy baby line often makes claims to education through TV that are less than convincing. Working as a professional, private educator, and having studied the development of creativity in my M.Ed. from Harvard, I find Brainy Baby's claims of their product's educational value dubious at best. While studies have shown that shows like Sesame Street and Blue's Clues--through symbolic repetition--can have a substantive impact on preschool cognitive development, there is little reason to believe that these same techniques have comparable impacts on toddlers. If your goal is to enhance creativity in your youngsters, give them three-dimensional toys that fit with their more tactile and auditory stage of development. Save the TV for your own time."
4,Literal Title,"Most people will read the title and think it's a 101 book on Wicca or Witchcraft or both. However it's NOT either. Taking the title literally it's a book on CRAFTS. Basically a how-to book on making robes, candles, brooms, wands, crosses, pendulums, smudges, books, athames!!!, holiday related, etc.So if you really want to learn how to do it yourself for pretty much ANYthing that deals with working magic, ritual and what to do for the holidays this is it.The only part I found...bad was the athame part. It's almost copy and paste from Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft. Not only that, the book makes it out that every craft is simple and easy to do and everybody can make these out of stuff lying around. I'm sorry I don't have a metal cutter and metal grinder just lying around my house. White glue and newspapers...maybe."
5,Great for Starters,"I have read other reviews about this book, and I have to say that I may disagree with some of what was said. I loved the book and couldn't put it down. No, many of the crafts call for equipment we all don't have laying around, but I was actually surprised at how much I did have in my own home and what I had that could be used as a substitute.This book is a great starting point for Wiccans looking for simple to in depth craft ideas or just a little boost in your own creativity. No the book is not a complete encyclopedia of everything a Wiccan might want to craft, but it definitely gives you a starting point, some great ideas, and is very easy to understand for the most part.I would recommend it to anyone with the curiousity to explore Wiccan crafts, but I do admit I will definitely be searching for a more detailed and intese book of crafts, recipes, etc."
2,stick to the unabridged single volume edition,"I recently purchased the two volume edition of The Wind In The Willows to give as an xmas gift. I was disapointed to see how heavily edited this version is. The twelve chapters of the original have been rearranged to seven chapters in this edition. Some of the chapters seem to have been incorporated into others, but some (chapter 7 from the original) are missing in their entirety. It is ashame because the box, binding and illustrations are all wonderful in this set, but I think it is too large a trade off for all of the missing and edited text."
3,For collectors--the illustrations are glorious,"It's the most beautifully illustrated edition of Wind in the Willows I've ever found, but the abridgement is a disappointment. It's not immediately apparent that the stories themselves have been ""updated"" along with the illustrations, and I don't recommend this edition for the most satisfying read. However, for those who love to collect children's books, and find pleasure in revisiting old and beloved stories with new eyes, these books are a true bargain for the illustrations alone."
4,Buy this book for its wonderful pictures!,"I'm a diehard fan of _Wind in the Willows_--and a purist who thinks that Shepard's illustrations aren't authentic because they aren't Rackham (the illustrator of MY childhood copy). And I hate abridgement. So go figure: I love this new illustration of Wind in the Willows, principally because it brings to life the atmosphere of the book in a wonderful way that resonates with my own strong feelings. I'm not fond of abridgements in general, and the ""Pipers at the Gates of Dawn"" chapter, strange as it might be, is central to the book and therefore its omission leaves a gaping hole; nonetheless, I recommend the book for its illustrations alone--one could read the original text along with Moore's atmospheric art."
3,Nice but I had to modify,"I like the size and the sparkle it has to it. It's silver-sparkly with black outline. What I didn't like is the edges beyond the black outline is just white, like you see in the picture. So it looks like a cheap sticker when you put it on your car (unless maybe you have a white car, which I don't). So I took a razor knife and very carefully cut along the black outline to cut off the white edge, and now it looks great. And I like that it's a magnet instead of a sticker, making it easy to remove."
1,A total waste of time and money,"Can't bend my mind around as to why this totally boring movie got an average of four stars??? The story line is uninspiring, I didn't laugh (or even smile) once, and the characters were totally flat and lifeless. If this is the best that Hollywood has to offer these days in terms of romantic comedies, then I think I'll stick with You've Got Mail. And Katherine Heigl should really go back to Gray's Anatomy and not waste her talent on such nothingness."
1,Boring! Awful! Save your money!,"If I had seen this movie in the theatre, I would have walked out in the first 10 minutes and demanded my money back. The next two hours don't get any better. This was the most unbelieveable romance I've ever seen between two actors. Josh can't act his way out of a paper bag. In fact, he gave it as much believability as a sack puppet. The romance between the woman and her doctor boyfriend was far more believeable.Can we talk about the baby? For an entire year the kid doesn't get any older. Oh, they have her going through the motions of learning to walk and talk, but it's the same exact baby throughout the movie. Then they go from autumn to winter and bam! She advances at least a year!There's nothing about this movie that is funny or romantic. It's just plain boring from start to finish and about an hour tooooooo long."
1,dvd did not work,I was so sad to get this dvd home and realize it didn't work! I put it in one dvd player and it didn't work so I assumed it was the player. Then I put it in a second one and it didn't work and I was mad. I hate throwing valuable money down the drain!!! Please sell quality products. Thanks.
1,Warknig: This movie will lower your IQ,"Lame, predictable, vulgar, sloppy -- in one word, post-modern. I didn't care about the characters, I have no idea why the parents would choose them as godparents, I couldn't even bring myself to watch the last 15 minutes of it. It's simply a waste of time and brain cells.I wonder how the actress could go from ""Love Comes Softly"" to this junk."
2,"Ok, nothing more","This movie was not great by any stretch of the imagination. I'm sorry, but Katherine Heigl is just not likeable in anything I've ever seen her in. She always plays the uptight, wrapped up in herself career girl and this movie is no exception. I can't even begin to feel sorry for her situation because she is so unlikeable. Josh Duhamel is okay for a leading man, but there was just no chemistry there at all between the two. Overall, a pretty blah movie."
1,Suckville !!!!,"Probably one of the worst i have seen don't bother, The good reviews up top must of had blinders on don't waste your money."
5,Life strikes,"When you want to take a break from your norm this is a great distraction. You learn that life hits us in the face but we can manage whatever cards we are dealt. This is a great movie, with the perfect amount of humor related to a very serious issue. Both big name stars came through with grace. I took my son to see it and it is a bit much for him, but the R parts are obscured so well. Watch it."
2,Poor romantic comedy,"Throughout the movie I found myself annoyed by certain things...such as why the parents chose two godparents who not only are not married but hate each other. And of course, since they don't have children, taking care of a child is the ultimate hell for them and they have no idea what to do. They were told that it was a choice for them to take care of the baby, so they could have chosen for just one of them to be the parent. But of course, they have to fall in love... Most of the jokes weren't that funny and it was very predictable."
1,Not so good and overrated,A typical Katherine Heigl movie. Yeah it is that predictable. The trailer gives away the entire plot.. You are better off watching something better.
2,Heart rending ..not in a good way,The best actors in this film are ones playing the child protection caseworker and the teenage babysitter. Enough said.
3,Nice movie,"Cute movie, baby is adorable. I enjoyed it but that's probably because I like Josh Duhamel and Katherine Heigl is a decent actress."
2,Broken case,"The DVD arrived with a deep cut about three inches long, from the top down. The case had a sticker placed over the cut, marked ""new"". I had an extra case to transfer it into but very disappointed the company would send a ""new"" DVD in a case that was basically destroyed. Not good business."
3,Okay...,"It was funny, but relatively predictable. Nice entertainment for the evening, but not overwhelmingly rememberable. The baby was pretty cute..."
4,Entertaining with unexpected depth,"From my wife Sarah: From the previews I expected a silly slapstick romance, but found that this was a drama, romance and comedy rolled up into one movie. It had surprising depth, character and story development. It was kind of a believable story. There were times I was touched enough to be tearful, and there was some decent chemistry between the leads. There were some laughs as well.It was good, but was it fantastic? Not so much. Honestly, it wasn't strong enough for me as either a comedy, romance or drama to be terrific. Regardless, it was entertaining, moving and worth seeing."
4,Good movie if you really look deep.....,"This movie has received more than its fair share of bad press. I went and saw this movie when it was in my local theater last summer. I think the major reason people are giving it bad reviews is that they are expecting the whole movie to consist of a mismatched couples attempt to raise a child to yield roll on the floor laughing moments. However, to truely understand this film, you have to look deep for the hidden meaning. I found that when you discover that the movie truly revolves around a child who's parents are killed and is left to be raised by two different people who really didn't want to be together, much less raise a child together, then you get the true spirit of the film. Once you understand this point of view you will truly enjoy this film for what it is, a coming of age story."
4,cute movie,This was a cute movie. It is a pretty typical romantic movie that keeps you laughing and smiling throughout most of it. I thought it had a good mix of funny and serious moments. Would definitely recommend.
3,Adequate movie,Inoffensive is about the best I can say. I would rather have waited for it on cable and not paid for it.
4,Nice movie,"I really like this movie. I think it is nice, funny and entertaining. I wanted to have this movie in dvd and add it to my collection."
2,just ok,"heard alot of hype about this film and i saw it recently and i didn't find it funny or that memorable. things were obvious from the word jump and it was all long winded and drawn out before it got to the obvious. the acting was ok as well, nobody stood out and this film has been made 499 times already and about 480 times better as well. the storyline was sad, but the formula of the film was just kinda there."
3,Leads save this Life,"I just got around to watching this movie that I bought on DVD. It was OK. I liked the chemistry between Josh and Katherine the best. Definitely predictable but I like happy endings and romantic comedies. I didn't like some scenes like when Hollie smashed up Messer's motorcycle...like she would even go on one with the baby's parents dead from a car crash...even with a helmet. I also thought the pot scene was not necessary. It was OK since they baked it into brownies? The neighbors were funny...the gay couple who always gave a wink to Messer and Melissa McCarthy who stole every scene she was in! Jean Smart was wasted as Hollie's mother. While I liked the ending, I thought Messers declaration of love was out of the blue. I will say this, I liked Life as We Know It better than Heigl's other romantic movie, 27 Dresses."
2,life as we know it,No real chemistry between the main characters. I didn't really care what happened between them. The girl from Bridesmaids was funny.
3,No Life as We Know It...,"Mediocre movie -- rather disappointing considering that it had so many well-known, funny and likeable actors. Glad I only rented and did not purchase."
4,Good drama/comedy for a Friday night,"It's a great date night movie. Also it's a good reminder to do your will! i would recommend it for anyone, especially parents!"
3,Good movie but...,"We enjoyed what we could view of this movie, however the streaming quality really sucked. Movie kept timing out & took several minutes to retrieve again, making it a long, boring process. Ended up using a laptop to finish watching the movie. Movie is funny, sometimes just a bit too much focus on sex, sometimes a bit slow. Didn't like how neurotic/bitter the heroine was, at times just a bit too much."
1,"Unfunny, annoying and looong, really bad. parents killed off so couple can get together in the end, lame!","I have no idea how listening to TWO hours of a SCREAMING BABY is funny. I got stuck watching this HORRIBLE movie on a date and was forced to finish watching it to be polite. It was PURE TORTURE. Katherine Heigl must really think she is very special to make people pay to sit through this annoying, unfunny, predictable and offensive movie. The parents are killed off(terrible idea) and the 2 idiots end up getting together as a couple in the end, shocking! You could not PAY ME to watch this movie again."
3,It's OK,I wish they could make movies that were cleaner. Not everyone goes to bed with everyone they meet and movies don't need to suggest that they do.
4,It is cute when they are together as a couple. But it is sad when the partents die?,And it is cute they get back together again at the end of the story which is good they happy together!!!
4,Likeable movie,"I love just about anything Kathrine Heigl does. Overall, this movie took you from happiness to sadness and reminded me that you never know what to expect out of life. Overall, it was poignant, funny and an insightful movie."
4,Made me laugh!!,"Is silly comedy, most unlikely to happen, like the cast, Katherine did a great job!!! will recomend to adults only."
3,It's ok,"The relationship that put them at odds seemed very forced many times. I do like katherine, so it made it easier to watch."
4,good movie,"i like this movie. romantic, funny, and the perfect blend of everything! There was one or two sad parts but it kept you watcing"
3,An entertaining flick via Amazon,"While it's no Academy Award winner, the actors in this romantic comedy are charming, the script is decent, and the direction is good. There are also enough warm-hearted and funny moments to make for satisfying viewing.All-in-all, an enjoyable way to spend an evening."
3,Not bad,"This wasn't a bad movie. Got kind of annoyed at some of the parenting stuff they did in the movie. Probably wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't already a parent. But, it was entertaining and pulled on my heart strings some because it is a very real thing that could happen to anyone."
2,Potential but Filled with Unnecessary Parts,"I really wanted to like this movie, as it sounded like it had a great premise. But it had to throw in all of these unnecessary plot points, like their tryst one night, and the wholly unnecessary scenes with the drugs."
2,"Boring and predictable, no appeal",This movie had me watching the clock to see how much more I would have to endure. A cute baby is no compensation for boring characters played by actors with no chemistry and predictable plot contrivances.
3,Not Bad,"Not bad, but not the most fantastic movie either. A lot like ""Friends With Children (or kids)"" actually. I do like Katherine Heigl, however, and it seems that she can play opposite almost any man in Hollywood and make it work."
3,good watch,so we were bored and we needed somethong to watch..we wanted a chic flick but my bro in law was there so we decided to watch this...not bad...the streming quality really bugged us...but good overall
3,Great Team,Life is to short and we never knows what live will bring us. Have to be prepared and let people know your plans if they include them.
4,LIFE AS WE KNOW IT,"VERY GOOD MOVIE ABOUT CHILDREN AND ADOPTED NEW PARENTS,.. QUALITY ACTORS, GREAT SCENES AND FUNNY FAMILY INTERACTION...MOVIE HAS A GREAT child interaction too"
5,Loved it!,"I believe this is one of the best movies I have seen in a really long time. Movies are becoming so pathetic and lame, where I don't even go to the theaters anymore to see movies. There are hardly any movies coming out that are suitable for children. This could be a true story of love, hope and faith, when you truly love someone as much as these two loved Sophie. Wonderful movie for the entire family."
2,One that I thought was going to be good,"This was one of those movies that I thought was going to be really good. I waited for it to come out on netflix and saw it. I kept trying to watch it but there just isnt enough to keep your interest. There are quite a few funny parts throughout the movie but overall, I dont believe it is worth buying. I'd recommend renting or borrowing it first, then decide whether or not you want to buy it."
3,One Laugh Wonder,"Cute movie, but nothing that kept me laughing. One part that is uncontrolled laughter, but that's it. Cute storyline. I would suggest waiting till it goes on sale. ;)"
4,I love Heigl,"I think Katherine Heigl is one of the best comedic actresses making films today. I bought this movie sight unseen and was not disappointed. It was not as 'soft and fuzzy' as it might have been :0), it was just a light, pleasant and funny movie that didn't require a lot of emotional involvement. It's a keeper!"
3,Just okay,Movie was cute and had some funny spots in it but it was a little predictable and boring. A typical ending.
5,Heart Felt,"I can't imagine dealing with a loss, much less trying to communicate and fulfill our responsibilities with someone in stark contrast. But, they did it and it is an amazing movie. It arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition."
3,Life as We Know It,"Nicely filmed and touching story. The attraction between the two lead characters is not plausible. Some of the hystrionics are shrill with strangely petty dialog. It didn't give me nightmares. However, it didn't put a smile on my face, either. And that's what I'm looking for in a romantic comedy (a smile)."
3,DVD review,"The write-up on the DVD jacket, pretty much sums it up in explaining how life is as life is for a growing family. It has its funny moments and some not so funny. It was okay. There is nothing more to say about this movie."
1,Disappointed,"I was really excited to see this movie, as it had Katherine Heigl and Christina Hendricks, and this was Hendricks' first big film. When I started it, I was immediately in awe--how could any characters be less likable?Heigl's and Duhamel's characters were vapid, immature, and whiny.They got into a fight after their one ""night together"". Duhamel should have ditched her for being too clingy. Of course he should take the promotion--don't hold him back.Duhamel's shining moment was when he was silently sitting in the airport looking at a video of Heigl and the baby and a sweet old lady had to plant the notion in your brain that they made a cute family.Heigl came off scatter-brained and, well... stupid. I was pretty offended--I'd held her to higher esteems prior to this movie.I never leave reviews. This movie was awful."
2,"Good premise, stupid execution",How slowly can you grow up? How can two very different people make a life together? This movie will show you how NOT to do it.
3,Endearing,Enjoyed this movie and the reactions the actors had to some of the emotional situations came off as real and honest. Had a great time watching this.
3,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""NOTHING FABULOUS ABOUT THESE BIRD'S BLUES!""","As ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"", I don't agree with some publications that listed this CD in the blues section. For the benefit of novice blues aficionado's, this Thunderbird group is ""post"" Jimmie Vaughn, among others. If I were to pick a category for this CD it would be in the pop rock area. If I were to review it in that area, which is not my ""schtick"", nor my desire, I would rate it a little more favorably. But this does not pass Shaq's test for any type of blues rating. So, if you're one of Shaq's worldwide blues followers, I wouldn't buy this CD. If you're a Mary Joe Shemply type (a generic alias) in Bismarck, North Dakota, who wants to rock a little, then buy it. Meanwhile, Shaq, needs to get back to the electric blues world, and has left the building!"
4,FINALLY THE RIGHT MIX,"After Jimmy Vaughn's departure it seemed the T-Birds were quickly becoming Kim Wilson's vanity project. The cohesiveness was gone, band members coming and going from each album to the next. However there is a new stability to this once vital band. Kirk Fletcher and Nick Curran have brought the birds back to the forefront of contemporary blues on this sparkling disc. Time has done wonders to Wilson's vocals. No longer the derivitive shouter his voice, despite the great instrumental prowess is the driving force. He also keeps things at a lively pace co-producing with Steve Berlin of Blasters and Los Lobos fame. Let's hope the revolving door is closed and a new and exciting chapter in this groups rich history will be written."
3,Painted On - Fab T-Birds,"Kim Wilson is in good form in a band with great players, but it somehow nonetheless fails to really grab you. The early albums with J Vaughan are a very hard act to follow!"
2,Dissappointed,"I am primarily a fan of Nick Curran and Kirk Fletcher so I eagerly awaited the release of this album. When I heard it, I couldn't believe that their talents were not utilized more. Why get two of the best blues guitarists alive and waste their abilities on run of the mill blues/rock songs. I'm sure this album is a step up from recent Thunderbirds' album, but when you consider the talent in the band, it is a definite disappointment. Both Nick and Kirk put out FAR BETTER music on their solo efforts."
1,This book was the menace,"I had to read this book for a graduate class, otherwise I would not have even bothered with it. In all fairness, the author does make his arguement in the first four sections of the book where he evaluates each of the first four Potter books, which were what was out when this was published. Yet the last half of the book jumps into a tyriad on the dangers and horrors of all branches of occulism and sounds like a mad rant rather than a ordered presentation of interpretations. This is just one in a series of books ...And the Bible, so I'm sure the formula for them is the same, the targeted book and characters just changes."
1,An offensive and unwarranted attack on children's fiction,"This book was an unwarranted and offensive attack on a successful series of YA fiction -- perhaps the best such series to come along in some time, with perhaps the sole exception of Pullman's Dark Materials series. In order to hold his book together, Mr. Abanes quotes liberally from the very books he would prefer that no one read, and gives blow-by-blow summaries of each of the four books published to date.I strongly encourage people looking for insightful analysis of the Harry Potter series to look elsewhere."
1,Richard Abanes is JEALOUS OF ROWLING (probably),"I look at this book and laugh. Harry potter promotes Satanism? Evil? Well, maybe in some people's eyes, but this is ridiculous. I don't mind people sharing their opinions, but they can be harsh.If you ask me, I wouldn't like it if my writing was called evil. This book (which I have combed through and made a parody of it on my computer) is nothing more than a cold, oversized critique bound with professional binding glue.Cinderella has magic in it, so does Aladdin. Same with the Little Mermaid, The Sword in the Stone, etc and I don't see people ragging Disney!!Please don't think I'm evil, but people can turn over to the 'other side' if they want. It's their life. If you don't like Harry Potter, then don't read it. Some people do belive in magic, and they don't worship the devil. Simple and Clean."
1,retarded very retarded,first I am a big harry potter fan I have read books 1-5 and I already know that Harry potter is not real. But it is very enjoyable to read. I havent read this book but I know it will be a boring times infinity. HP is not showing the dark side of magic it is showing the good side
4,Very informative,"I found the book very informative especially the first chapters. Although a lot of people can't see the value in it, I feel parents need to be informed about what their children read. You know the terminology GIGO. Garbage in, garbage out..............."
1,Absurd,"Utter, utter nonsense. A pack of desperately sick lies. There's not a shred of reason to read this tripe."
1,I haven't read this but-,"It really frightens me that people can get so worked up over words.It's a brilliant set of book. This author hasn't read it. He just saw the film. HP teaches morals. (...) It also tells children not to give out personal details online because Ginny's diary is like a chatroom. This shows that the same moral as the last book. There are lots of morals in this book, even the 5th one. So please don't hate this book because it has magic in it."
1,Missing the point,"Honestly, you're missing the point. The magic in Harry Potter is a prop in the story line, not the story line. It's not as if the books are promoting the usage of magic (without a ""k""). Over the summer I started an article against all the accusations insulting the point of the Harry Potter books. I didn't finish it, due to time and scrambled thoughts, but this may have given me a new fire to do so. Climb out of your box; if you're going to compare something to the bible, compare the world and criticize is. That would be a worth-while mission. The Harry Potter books aren't real. As long as kids (and adults) don't get carried away with them, there is no harm in them. Focus on the larger influences."
1,This book is a pack of lies!!,"This book is a pack of lies would have given it 0 stars if could. Harry Potter teaches children to stand up to your friends and to respect the other person no metter where she or he came from , what religion they have ,or what they read.Actually I can only quote a good friend of mine ""False faith and witch fear work are things, which harm us more then any occult. The fubndamentalist church builds its power on lies! What became of the rock, on which Jesus wanted to establish its church? A rotten bit stone? If the faith will be kept upright by lies only, then it is more worth nothing.The burning of books makes this statement een more evident.We can not live in the 2nd century anymore we as human being have to progress."
1,Teaching the Occult,"I am a fan of the Harry Potter series and when a relative bought this book for me and told me what is was about, I was interested and was wondering if the books could really lead a child to occultism. I began to read the book and found that most of the references were misleading, biased, and informed more about the occult than it helped to prevent it. I realized that if a child read this book and learned that such things were possible, (even if the child knew that attempting such things was wrong or evil) the child might then take an interest in the occult that this book has so kindly informed the child of. My opinion of the book is that it does more harm than good in then sense that it teaches the child about the occult. If I were a parent I would not buy this book for my child(ren)."
1,Me thinks thou protesteth to much.,"If I were looking for witchcraft information this book is fantastic source. Using Harry Potter as it's springboard it identifies scads of things that ""real"" witches, warlocks and other occult figures mess around with. I find it to be full of typical fundamentalist scare tactics, finding dangers everywhere and trusting only in themselves for salvation. While it is well written and picks many issues to hammer on it does it with tricky spelling of words (""magick"" an ancient spelling) and spooky tales that connect to Harry Potter in only the most tenuous ways. Harry Potter when all is said and done is a fantasy and is fun to read. This book is a lot of petulant whinning. I think all parents should be aware of and make their children aware that occultism is dangerous but if we react as foolishly as the author of this work does our children will look for wisdom elsewhere."
1,What an idiot,"As Hermione said in the first movie, ""What an idiot..."" Abanes is using the Harry Potter name to publish his crackpot ideas and cash in on the phenomenon. Best to leave it alone; there are much better books out there covering the spiritual aspects of Harry Potter. This one is better left gathering dust."
5,"If you were having this discussion with God, what do you think he would say?","Are the Harry Potter books just harmless fantasy or do they go against God's Word & His principles?'Harry Potter & the Bible,' answers this question & more.Richard Abanes gives the Biblical Scriptures and the page and book title where the harmful actions orstatements are located in the Harry Potter books.Additionally, he compares acceptable, excellent Christian fantasy books such as those by C.S. Lewis, & J.R. Tolkein to the fully occult deviant Harry Potter books. This is a tremendous tool for parents that are interested and concerned about their children's spiritual health & future welfare. Parents that wish to ignore what their children are forcibly reading in the public schools & are not ready to give up their Harry Potter books, videos, games etc.; will not be happy with the conviction or knowledge of the damage that these pagan materials cause."
2,i can not agree,There are two ways of looking at Harry Potter. You either love him or you hate him. Obviously the author of this book hates Harry Potter. I decided to read this book with an open mind and I have to disagree with what the author is saying. While it's obvious that the author is sincere this is not a particularly good book. The writing is stiff and many of the conclusions make no sense. The author's near hysteria made it difficult for me to take him seriously.
3,Parents' Responsbaility,"Regardless of the validity of the points within the book, there is one thing that can make it all irrelavent. If parents have control over their children and raise them the proper way, then ANY media-type influence shouldn't make a difference. If you want your child to be a Christian yet you have to worry about a book (or song, or movie) driving them away from that, then you have not instilled the proper foundation of faith in them. I frankly think that exposing children (and all people) to different ideas goes a long way to strengthening their current beliefs by challenging them to justify why they believe in something in the first place."
5,Exposing the Menace,"I learned as a child that if you throw a frog into a boiling pot he'll immediately jump right out, BUT, if you put him in cold water and slowly heat it he becomes accustomed to the environment and will be content to be boiled. Have we become like those frogs? Are we so accustomed to some practices that before we know it they have overtaken us?The Harry Potter Books are being marketed as wonderful children's books and are being used in our local school system as a means to encourage children to read. But by de-sensitizing our children to the occult practices in these books are we doing more harm than good?This book is a well documented, well written and thought provoking work. My children are grown, however, I feel it is a MUST READ for any parent, grandparent or educator. After reading it I know that I was more than prepared to make an intelligent decision about this series."
5,Great Read for Boys,Non fiction + Mystery a great combination for young male reluctant readers. Providing books that combine history and social studies bring that lesson to life.
1,Just a start!,"This book is like a textbook (very small textbook) probably written by someone who knows a fair bit but has no ability to teach and explain. The book is a small paperback book with minimal illustrations that tries to cover the complete building of a model boat. If it were a map, it would be one 8.5 x 11 map of the whole United States."
4,"Great value, good bike for the price",I purchased this bike for my son away at college and he was pleasantly surprised. He has been riding it now for a few weeks and said that it handles the bumps and potholes very well. He said that he wanted a bike that he could ride to and from work and class in all types of weather and so far this bike has delivered. He's also had it out on the bike trails in his free time. We've had no complaints thusfar and it was very easy and quick to put together. Good bike for the price!
1,Using with Kyocera S3X not working,"When I used this card in my Kyocera S3X Fincam, this card was not working successfully. All the photographies were stored, but couldn't displayed on the camera screen. Using a card reader it worked, so I could store the photographies on a CD Rom. The seller tried this card on a S3X Finecam out of his store with the same result described above.Maybe the card is ok, but seems to be not compatible to the camera"
1,Card died,"I got one for a Magellan GPS unit. It worked fine for awhile. Recently, however, while I was trying to load a map onto it using an SD reader, I started getting error messages. I reformatted it, but scandisk found unusable areas, so I ditched it."
5,Good stuff,"We eat this brand of soy butter all the time - I love it on sandwiches and apple or celery. The honey creamy is a little better, I think, but hard to find unless you have a Whole Foods nearby. This is a pretty good price too"
5,The best,I will have to say that MY LIFE is one of the best cds that MARY has put out. I haven't bought her current cd yet so I stiil have yet to judge that but Im almost certain that My Life will reign over it because this cd is so real. I have about 6 favorites on this joint and that is pretty rare to have that many favorites. The songs that I reccomend isTrack 3 You Bring me Joy- Good dance track with funky beatsTrack 7 My Life- this song is a reality heart felt track backed with good music and LyricsTrack 9-Never wanna live without you-Good vocals and lyricsTrack 14-Dont Go- good songTrack 15- I Love you- good beats and LyricsTrack 17- Be happy- Good Lyrics Beats and VocalsOne Love
5,No surprise this album has it all.,Only a diva can come out with a hit cd everytime. The record is interesting because it is giving you advise straight out of her mouth. Only true fans I recommend this for.
5,...,"...mary been carryin that 'no more drama' banner since this cd came out! the exception is that besides puttin her heart and mind into this album, she truly put her SOUL into it!!! yall can feel it!!! whatever nonsense was brewin in her life at this time lead to some truly inspired craftsmanship between her and puffy...she sings the blues honestly on this and you can feel it in her voice that she still has that hope and confidence that things are gonna work out..., mary tears it up!!! no lie!...this is my favorite...when she says ""i'm the only woman"" i believe it and yall will too..."
2,the best,"this is the best album mary has ever made. its a classic, u can listen without skipping around"
4,Outstanding!,"I'm an old school guy (70's, 80's soul) and got into Mary J. very late in the game, this being the first CD I bought of her's. Truly outstanding. I love her voice, it sounds so true and honest ... and from what I've read about her, I just like her, period.Mary J. is just an outstanding performer and singer and for me, better late than never in buying her music. I look forward to many more purchases."
4,Definitely the Queen Of Hip Hop and R & B,Mary J. Blige is a wonderful artist. I truly respect even more because of her testimony of hardknocks of growing up in the hood. This 2nd album shows her pain and suffering all expressed on a CD. My favorite song on this album is 'My Life'. This song talks about basically what she went through and is going through. People need to definitely get this CD because it is a go getta.
5,This album is the pinnacle of Hip-Hop soul!!!,"There are few albums that have dropped in recent years which have the emotional and lyrical power that Mary J. Blige's sophomore album ""My Life"". This album connects and identifies with anyone who has ever had hard times or been in love. Lyrics such as, ""Life can be only what you make it, when you're feeling down you should never fake it,"" and songs such as ""You Gotta Believe,"" illustrate the deep emotional level Mary was on when she dropped this album. This album is the gold standard for Hip-Hop soul. The Alpha and Omega of the industry!!"
1,Do not buy a Western Digital HD,"I bought this hard drive thinking it would be good because Western Digital was a good name that you could trust. It works fine for the first 6 months and those of you who just bought it might think I'm dead wrong, but just wait. Everything begins to go wrong, and I've taken every precaution to make sure it stops messing up. Nothing works. I have to reformat every month because it doesn't want to work for some reason. Do NOT get this drive, it will give you fits. And this isn't because I had a defective drive, I exchanged it for a different HD and had similar problems. I recently bought a new hard drive from Maxtor. Maxtor seems to be making good hard drives. I've had no problems with the 160GB drive and it works wonders compared to the WD drive. Those of you looking for a new hard drive, do not be fooled by this one."
1,Two Failed WD80 GB HDD in one Year,"For many years I used and recommended the WD products. I can no longer offer any such advice but would recommend that anyone looking for a quality HDD look elsewhere -- Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung, Hitachi are all superior drives and far more reliable.Both drives simply suffered meltdown failure of the motors, shorting out the computer Power supply until removed-- two different computers at two different times, both being used moderately, not ""heavy office"" or workstation use. Western Digital was useless and insisted that such failures are rare and likely due to abuse. They know that the 80 GB Drives are faulty and they refuse to ""fess up."" The government should order a recall and everyone should get a credit to buy some other brand of drive. Even when HD drives were delicate in the early 80's, I never had any just burn up like these bits of WD paperweights. My current favorite recommendation is the new Seagate 160 GB and 250 GB drives, fast, quiet and reliable."
2,Good luck mirroring your old drive,"If you are like me you are buying this drive to replace a smaller and slower hard drive. So you want to move all your old data to the new drive and go on like nothing happened, right?Well, I followed their directions on the Data Lifeguard product to the letter and when i booted up off the new drive I had lost functionality in several of my programs. After hours of struggling with it I gave up and just did a clean install of Win XP. Hopefully mine is an isolated case but it is not like I'm running some obscure system. I have a new Dell desktop running Win XP.I think the Data Lifeguard program needs some work. Aside from that, the drive itself is working great so far."
4,What a voice,"I first heard this cd on KCRW and had mucho trouble tracking down a copy. Once I did, it is a cd that I recommend to all music lovers. Her voice, the songs, and the audience make this a must have."
5,like listening to a sparrow sing at the rising of the sun,"Chante is awesome. Her words are crisp, her lyrics moving. Tender. Seductive. Innocent. Real. Embodied with so much passion. Each word, her every breath takes you to a place so pure and etheral. I've been a major fan since I heard her live in Hollywood, then witnessed her humble and witty personality on BET, back in the Donnie Simpson days. Loved the snippet she did on NY Undercover. I never tire of listening to her CDs. I've played her music so much, that if my CDs were old fasioned LPs, they would have googol scratches! So when's the new one coming out! I'm going through withdrawls!"
4,awesome cd,"awesome cd, bought it one time before and lost it, now i have it back...every song is good, all CD's should be like this. CD was in great condition and arrived on time."
4,Great CD if I had never heard her first CD.,"This sounded great. I've had the CD for 2 years now, and I still love it!! Her voice is so unique, and strong. I wish she'd leave the remakes alone though. She is better than the original! Do your own thing girl!!!"
5,Chante is one of the most talented artists who is slept on!,This is her absolute best album! Every song is a work of art. Her voice is so smooth and sultry. Chante definitely has skills and she does not get recognized for her talent. She is one of the best vocalists of all time.
2,"Official Price Guide to Books, 5th Edition (Official Price Guide to Books)","As a book collector I was disappointed with this book. The text was generally informative but I found the collectible book listing unreliable vis;The author Patrick O'Brian was spelt O'Brien and his first book ""Master and Commander"" (the most valueable in the series) not even listed.Also a number of collectible authors of modern 1st's were not listed.Little things like this jaundiced my view of the efficacy of the publication.A much better book is ""Guide to First Edition Prices 2008/9 R.B Russell."
4,Pretty Good Guide - But needs more non-fiction titles,I sell used books on eBay and bought this to bring with me when I go to estate and garage sales. I tend to find and make more money with Non-fiction and this book is heavily weighted to fiction. But it's a pretty good resource none the less.
3,"REVIEW OF OFFICIAL PRICE GUIDE TO GUIDE, 5TH EDITION","Honestly, I was a little disappointed with this book. I thought it would go more into depth about how to recognize an older valuable book. It was just a list of ""valuable books, and what they sold for on the Internet.""I thought the book would explain how to recognize a valuable book."
1,offical price guide to collecting books,"I felt it was a waist of time an money. I id;nt care for it what so every. Rating 1 to 10 Id rate it a 0 That's how bad it was,,,,offical price guide to collecting books"
4,A remote control for toddlers,"This was a gift. We have the little non-remote cars & trucks, and they are a hit. The remote took a while to get used to, but now he finds it a very amusing toy. There are two navigation buttons, straight and rotate. It takes a little trial and error for little ones to understand, but they do get the general idea. Push buttons and it will go.Straight is not exactly straight for very long. Beware, it goes under couches. A plus is that pieces from other tiny n tuff are interchangeable. The cars, remote or not, are a great size for toddlers. It does seem to be reliable and sturdy for a toddler remote control toy. A negative is that it's noisy. It does require two different types of batteries, a 9v for the remote, and 3 AAA for the car. We use rechargeables for most toys, so that helps."
4,Real Puerto Rican music!,"I had this LP back in the late 70s and had the chance to see this group live in NYC oh so long ago. This is a beautiful CD, something I want to share with my child and family. An authentic example of Puerto Rican folkloric music and other Latin folkloric rhythms."
3,MP3 ALBUM,"Its a great album but the upload is of very low quality,One of the tracks didn't even download to my computer!"
4,Mega Bloks Dump Truck,"Our 9 month old received this for Christmas & he loves it. He likes pushing it around, putting items into the bucket & putting bloks onto the truck. We love it!"
2,A Disappointment,I was disappointed with volume 1. My daughter has The Going To Bed Book and Hippos Go Beserk! which the whole family loves. The books in volume 1 are boring and aren't as fun as many of Sandra Boynton's other books.
5,Perfect!,"I bought these as a grandparent for the triplet's first birthday. They love the stories, are engaged in the colorful illustrations, and are ready for bed following a few of their favorites each night!"
5,Love these books!,"My 14 month old daughter loves reading, and she is obsessed with these books. They have cute pictures and very catchy writing, and are very sturdy. A must-have for your tiny reader!"
2,Only two were good enough to keep - and those just okay.,"I purchased these books for my 6 month old son due to the positive reviews and found them disappointing overall. Only two were good enough to keep (A-Z and Moo, Baa, La La La) and Moo, Baa, La La La - just barely. Besides the A-Z book, the others do not keep his interest. He really likes when we read books that have more than just one or two words on a page, along with some rhyming in them. Books like Eric Clark's ""Foolish Tortoise"" and ""Greedy Python"" are favoirtes. Baby laughs at the melodic stories & they are entertaining for mom and dad to read too."
2,Love Boynton but these are not my favorites,I don't recommend this group of books. They are boring compared to other Boynton books. Dull with no interesting rhythms like some other books like PAjama Time or Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs.
5,wonderful set,"This is a wonderful addition to my grandson's ""library"". Each book is fun, unique and sturdy construction so we can enjoy them together or he can ""read"" alone. I'm very pleased with the purchase and would recommend it to everyone."
4,Good set of books,"I like these books, and so does my daughter. They are a good set to add to her growing collection."
5,MY SON ADORES THESE!!,"My 2 year old son just loves these! Not only did he love listening to them, but now, he ""reads"" them to me!! I am so proud of him that he is able to read them, almost word for word, but that is to Boynton's credit.Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set"
3,Book review,I have other Boynton books: Pajama Time and Barnyard Dance (LOVE THEM!). Was hoping this set would be as fun as the other 2. Boy was I wrong. No fun happy rhythmic songs. I was quite disappointed.
4,Enjoyable Book Set,"Enjoyed reading these books with my son. We loved other books by Boynton and wanted to purchase more, but these are not as funny as some of the others she has."
5,"Great books, great author!","I purchased and was given some other Sandra Boynton books for my daughter. I have been reading these books to her since she was a baby. I also check out books for her at the library on a regular basis and she always loves the books written by Sandra Boynton. I purchased this book set as my second set of Boynton books and as expected my daughter loves them! One of her favorites is ""Blue Hat, Green Hat."" I recommend any of Sandra Boynton's books!"
4,A New Type of Nursery Rhyme,"These are wonderful books. They are easy to read and memorize!!! If you do more than just read them (add the sounds, point to the body parts, point out special features in the book (like numbers and letters), etc, they also make learning fun.Moo, Baa, La La La: Great for learning animal sounds!!A to Z: Goes through the entire alphabet!!Doggies: Counting the number of barks 1-8 (in a 12 Days Before Christmas type of pattern)!!Blue Hat, Green Hat: Great for body parts and where different articles of clothing go on the body!!"
1,Boynton Books are over overated,"I bought this set for my 9 month old daughter after reading all of the rave reviews. I was excited to order the set but was dissapointed when they arrived. These books are not written well at all and the illustrations leave a lot to be desired. Honestly, anyone could have written these books. None of the books make any sense, have any real meaning or teach anything to children. The illustrations are not eye catching like they are in ""Goodnight Moon"". My daughter displays absolutely no interest for these books at all. She does have other books that she enjoys. There is no real benefit to reading these books to your child. If you love books like ""Goodnight Moon"", these books are not for you. The only benefit my child gets from these books now is she uses them to teeth on."
2,blah,i got the volume 2 of boynton's greatest hits and loved reading it to my daughter so i decided to get volume 1 but it was just sooooo boring. i couldnt get through any of them. i wouldnt recommend this one but volume two is great
4,Love Boynton's Books!!!,"What I love best about Sandra Boynton's board books is that they are fun for both my son to hear and for me to read. Our long-time favorite was ""Moo Baa LALALA"" - at 17 months, my son could recite every one of the animal sounds (well, except the pig). The only down-side of this set is the ""Doggies"" book. My husband and I hid this one because we detested reading it - all the barking, howling, whining, arfing, and woofing was tiresome."
5,My Baby Laughed,"We were at a local playgroup and they read Blue Hat, Green Hat. My 7-month old son laughed out loud. He had laughed before, but I think this was the first time he laughed without direct eye contact or being tickled. After playgroup I inquired -- Sandra who?? I hadn't heard of these books, but have since purchased several.My baby is now 2 and has a 4-month old brother. These books have become very popular favorites for reading time in our home.I wonder how old our new baby will be when he laughs at the ""silly chicken""."
2,Don't really care for any of the books in this pack,"We love The Going to Bed Book and illustrations, so I bought this to add to my 10 month old's library. I personally don't care for any of these books. The illustrations are cute, but rather than little stories they seem to be more rhythmic, rhyming words. Maybe when my son is more interested in looking at the pictures he'll enjoy them, but for now he just likes to listen to stories so these aren't for him."
4,Funny books,"Great for kids who are exploring board books and silly vocabulary. Boynton has created silly books, and this collection is less expensive than buying each book, one by one."
4,Fun books,"My daughter loves Doggies & Moo, Baa, La La La the best. It's probably because of the fun sound effects from mom & dad that the text lends itself to.Fun books that I'd recommend for your toddler."
5,Boynton Board Books Higly Recommended,"I highly recommend these books for all little ones. My two year old read these by herself and now reads them to her baby brother. The predictive, yet humorous text and entertaining pictures make this a pleasure to read for both children and adults!"
5,These are my favorite books to read to my girls,My girls are 5 and 3 and they love Sandra's books. I can't wait to get the whole collection. We have barnyard dance and snuggle puppy. My kids know every word and read/sing along the story with me.
1,"Very basic information, not very useful.","Just plain bad. From uniformative to downright incorrect, this book fails miserably to achieve it's goal. After reading this you will not be able to shape your personal sound beyond knowing the names of the knobs on various effects. I want my money back!"
2,Don't call it a Transformer!!,"I know you shouldn't expect too much for $ 6.00 - $ 7.00, but I was very disappointed with this guy. There is NOTHING to his transformation process - flip the dinosaur head up and take his tail off and that's it! Too easy to call it a Transformer!On the plus side, I do like his clear sword/tail and he looks good in dino mode.Only recommended for completists...."
3,Both Good And Bad,"I bought this for a friend as a Christmas present and it went over really well. The gift itself is an awesome idea, however, to be honest, this stuff tastes awful. It goes on your skin very thin, the paintbrush is incredibly cheap and the stencils are nothing more than cardboard with push out hearts and stars, etc. There's a fairly small amount of body paint as well, I'd suspect if you put enough on for it to be seen, all four containers would only last a night. So, while it's a great idea and a great gift, beware of the drawbacks before you buy."
1,Above All,"I am very sorry to give this book 1 star.I would have preferred not to give any.As I was given this book I was very much looking forward to reading it.Unfortunately I was terribly disappointed.I think this book could be sold as a reference book for adjectives concerning Jesus.B.Menning mentions that people can get helped by Jesus in different situations,but does not go any deeper into it than that.I find it very difficult to believe that this book and its writer are as popular as I read on this website."

1,Pedantic and unhelpful,"I had to read this book for a graduate music education course. When it was assigned, I looked forward to reading it because, up to now, I have found Canadian scholars of music education (e.g., Bowman, Elliott, Stubley, Lamb) to be exceptionally fine thinkers with excellent, cutting-edge ideas. I expected the same from Woodford, another Canadian. Unforunately, I was very disappointed. Woodford is not in the same league as his Northern colleagues. The content of his book (it's just a booklet, actually) will be unhelpful and uninspiring to any music educator interested in learning more about music, or music education, or engaging his/her students in the joys of music making. Woodford's book is about turning music teachers and music education into political-social tools. This is not a new idea, and it has potential, but Woodford does not have the writing and thinking abilities needed to justify his spin on this topic. In a nutshell: this book is an unconvincing and pedantic plod."
1,Socialist Ideology - Not Democratic Principals!,"This book makes a case for ""watering down"" music education. All students have the ability to learn. No student should determine what is taught in a music class anymore than in a Math or Science class. If you are interested in how to teach to the average, buy this book. Those who put down contest or festival ratings are usually ineffective teachers unable to reach that level of musicianship. If you would like to help students reach their potential in music expression and performance, find another, more practical book instead of this self-indulgent garbage. I agree with the reviewer below - if you voted for George Bush, you probably believe people are able to do more for themselves than if you are a liberal Democrat. Pass up this socialist garbage!"
4,"Great Product, Get Codes Pulled Free too!","A great product for diagnosing issues at your house. However if you are near an autozone or advance auto parts, stop by and have them pull your codes and clear the check engine light at the store (it's free). I recommend this for a weekend warrior, and stopping by a parts store if you don't want to invest the money to pull codes as needed."
3,"Works fine, but....","I'm not sure the extra features are worth the price. On my 2000 Nissan Maxima, it correctly retrieved codes. However, it didn't know what the code was (manufacturer specific code), and the extended freeze-frame data was of no use in diagnosing the problem. I ended up using the internet as reference. For what I used this for, just getting the code and reseting the light, a basic reader would suffice. I've not used the CAN portion, so I cannot comment on it."
4,Great tool! A must for do it your selfer.,"Tool is very simple to use, basically plug and play. The manual provides plenty of information (and may be a bit too much).Somehow the OBD-PClink software doesn't work on my PC. When I tried to link the tool to the PC (click on Tool Link), Windows generates application error and closed the program."
3,"Good, but not great for non US cars","This is a nice product, that sells itself on not needing to look up codes. However, they do not make it very clear, that this feature only works for Ford, GM, Chrysler and Toyota. If you have any other car, do not spend the extra money. Get the less expensive unit, since you will have to go on the web to look up the code definitions anyway."
4,Works as it should,"Simple review here: this works as it should, comes in handy if you have an older car that gets ""check engine"" lights often, but at over $100, it is pretty expensive. I will say, that if you aren't pretty handy under the hood and know how to troubleshoot car issues, this won't help you much. It gives you the OBD code, which is helpful, but is often only one piece of the puzzle."
1,Not received,"Due to failure to change my address, item not received. Post office say probably will be reutned to you.Leslie"
2,No Bombshell of a transformer,"I wish I could recommend Insecticon, but I can't. The Insect form is OK, but the robot mode looks ridiculous. It is just too squat. The transformation difficulty is too high for this level of transformer, as you have to have certain parts just so. The colo scheme is only so-so."
4,Very Good Lens,"To be fair, this is my first lens other than the ""Kit Lens"" that comes with the Digital Rebel (300D). So, with that in mind I would say this is an awesome lens! Granted, not having tried anything else, I can't say how it measures up to other lenses, but on its own merits, and against the kit lens this ROCKS! I am amazed at the sharpness of the shots I am getting! And f2.8 throughout the whole focal range is amazing. Digital Rebel owners, your kit lens will never be able to capture the shots this lens can! I'm shooting away like a fiend at f2.8 in low light, while my kit lens would be struggling to autofocus.Okay, you get the idea. More experienced photographers may be able to give a more unbiased review, but for a newbie, this is a great upgrade, for when you grow out of the original lens."
1,Bought the wrong stuff,I bought the wrong stuff and its non returnable.Thats bunk!!!Anybody interested in it?lol I'll have to pay a little closer attention next time!
3,"Wrong product order, but kept it for it's quality.","I wanted to buy some baking soda, and not baking powder. I kept it for future sake baking but I think a warning, or a visible statement for the customers not make the confusion. For example: ""*Consumer aware: THIS PRODUCT IS BAKING POWDER, NOT BAKING SODA!!!"" or something like that. ///"
2,Not happy!,"I just received this not even 10 minutes ago and when I went to open the package, there was white powder everywhere inside the packaging itself. 3 bags were fine but 1 bag had a big gash in the side of it."
5,GOD SEND,"I am on auto delivery for this product because it's the only chemical free baking soda I can find. It works wonders for all kinds of ailments, house cleaning, the list is endless."
1,packaging problem,I just opened the outer layer of the box and got baking powder everywhere! The plastic packages that contain the powder are broken. I can't return it due to Amazon policy.Few days later: Amazon sent me a new package for free. This one was in good shape.
2,Packaging isn't substantial,"Nothing wrong with the product, but the bag its in is light. It tears easy and was leaking some product when it arrives"
1,"Fantastic Taste, unfortunate about the MSG, though...","I used to buy the big bags of these and eat them constantly, then I looked at the back of the bag and saw they used MSG in the cheddar kind, but not in most of the others. I ate chex mix as a healthy alternative to chips and other junk food so them using something like this basically had me switch over to another snack. You can have your own opinions about MSG, but I think it's lazy personally when they don't even have to use it but they do anyways.They did taste great, though. Maybe if more people complain about them using MSG they'll release a new formula without it. And no, I don't mean take mono sodium glutamate off the label and replace it with yeast extract, or autolyzed yeast extract when it's basically just a different name for MSG. I'd buy them again if we got a no MSG formula."
5,Love it!,I love this CD! I was so excited to find it on amazon. I lost my original copy that I bought when it first came out and thought I was doomed to never hear it again. I love the mellow music mixed with just the right amount of storm. I am prone to nightmares and this CD can calm my mind so that I can sleep. It is awesome. My kids now listen to it before they go to bed.
1,False advertisement,We ordered this item as it lists all four color cartridges for our printer. We received the black cartridge only.I wrote the provider and asked them to advertise this differently.They offered to have it returned with a 15% restock fee.Watch this company carefully to make sure you are getting what you want.
3,Good book on a substandard AFV,"Steve Zaloga's ""M18 Hellcat Tank Destroyer"" is an informative and pleasing combination of the development, technical specifications and operational history of a fairly obscure WWII US Army armored vehicle with a poor though perhaps not fully deserved reputation.The book includes some nice computer-generated illustrations of postwar variations from the ARBiH and Venezuelan armies of the 1990's. Overall, Jim Laurier's illustrations are very well done.Osprey has served up another direct hit with this New Vanguard title."
3,Did not Meet Expectations,"I had 2 lengthy outdoor opportunities to test these boots. They fell short of my expectations. They're a bit heavier than I thought they would be. Even after 6 hours of being worn, they seem a little stiff. My biggest disappointment though was the boots inability to keep my feet warm. The first time I wore them the temperature was around 4 degrees. Within an hour I could start feeling discomfort from the cold and by an hour and a half I had to come inside to warm up. I think these boots were rated to -45 degrees. I don't know where they came up with this rating, but I greatly disagree with it."
5,great condition for a vhs!,Was only copy they had wish it was on DVD but works great on my VCR. Love it very funny. I wish they'd make an updated Biography about Roseanne.
3,"A good reference, not much more.","If you want a history lesson, written in the style of an academic, with endless foot notes and references, this is the book for you. If you however are a layman seeking Chan information, I would pass. It was interesting, with a lot of history, but my search is far more personal so I walked away from it rather disappointed. The author has done his homework, but it is rather a boring read, It's more of a text book, and not a very interesting one at that."
5,A must for the serious birder in the West Indies,"I am a wildlife biologist and the manager of a nature preserve in the northeastern US where I regularly lead bird walks. When travelling on vacation birding is a major interest; on a recent visit to the Dominican Republic this bird guide was indispensable. The illustrations were first rate and the text most informative. I was especially impressed with the ""Locality Index"" which helped immensely with the process of confirming the identification of several ""life"" birds. Having this local information at one's fingertips makes this book an extremely valuable and important work. I hope Mr. Raffaele's book will influence the format of future ornithological publications."
4,Problem with the book's scope.,This is an excellent book. There are many good-quality color plates and the information is current and accessible. My complaint about the book is the misleading title. The islands of Trinidad and Tobago are not included in the book's geographic coverage. Trinidad and Tobago are certainly in the West Indies. The reason they are not included in this book is actually the very reason that the bird fauna of these islands is so interesting: Trinidad and Tobago have a combination of more northern species found in the upper islands as well as South American species that have emigrated from Venezuela and further south. There is another book by Ffrench (strange spelling) that specifically covers the birds of Trinidad and Tobago.
5,It is the Bible for birding in the West Indies,"This book is THE authority in the region. Yes, it is a heavy little sucker, and no, it is not a field guide per-se, but this book has so much useful information for the serious birder (not the coffee-table birder, but the take-it-to-the-toilet-with-you-to-read birder) that these handicaps are largely overcome.Though recent hyperactivity by taxonomists and ornithologists working the region have made just a tiny teensy bit of the info in the book outdated, it is still a must-have for the no-nonsense Caribbean birder."
4,A good book but be sure you know what you want.,"Raffaele's book is a very good one for the birds of SOME THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS ONLY. He specifically states that he is not including birds of the islands off the Venezuelan coast or birds of Central America. We went on a cruise that included Aruba, Curacao, Panama and Costa Rica and my Birds of the West Indies was not useful at all. It's for birds of the Greater and Lesser Antilles only excluding islands off Venezuela. None of the rainforest birds we saw were in the book. So just be sure of what you want."
5,A Persian Anthology: Being Translations from the Persian,"I read this book because I wanted to better understand the culture of the Middle East, especially the Iran-Iraq area. One approach to studying a people is to read their poetry, literature, myths, and first hand observations of an individual. The author has decades of research in both areas. This book is a good companion to Browne's work, A Year Amongst the Persians."
3,"Well, yes, but . . .","While the plot summary in the editorial review is essentially correct, and this book has a lot going for it, it also suffers from what seems to be a characteristic Linz failing--an excess of crudeness, basically. From the bachelorette party which consists of a trip to a strip joint, to Ellie's bizarre work situation in which she seems ok with the skimpy uniform and continual harrassment, to the advances of her smarmy boss, to the strange honeymoon pranks--all this stuff threatens to suck the fun out of what would otherwise be a pretty good story. But, all that said, I love Ben's ongoing fairytale, and Linz creates a couple of pretty fascinating minor characters."
2,Waste of money - not functional,"I was very disappointed with this map upon receipt of it. While it does give a general idea of the city, the lack of detail and smallness makes it virtually useless if you need to truly navigate around town.Purchase the map if you want a fun-type map that highlights a few areas of interest but do not expect that it will function to help you find intelligent routes to your destination."
3,substitute filler,vendor should advise buyer that a fisher substitute will be sent even if sensa refill are no longer made
1,Sensa 64003 Black Ballpoint Pen Refill,"The product I received WAS NOT a Sensa product!The product was a generic refill with an adapter to make it fit the Sensa pen.The quality of the refill was not even close to the origincal product. I feel like I was ""taken."" The price whey charged was very high and I expected the Sensa product but did not receive it."
2,Just OK,"I love Carol Jago's ideas, but I can't help but think that she'd produce a better product if she published less often. These short books provide a few interesting insights, a lot that I've seen before, and then are over before they've barely begun. I was hoping from a lot more from this one, but it turns out that by reading the ""look inside"" section on Amazon, I'd pretty much seen most of it before it even arrived in the mail."
4,Loved it,"This book was different from others in the sense that its ""train of thought"" was not consistent, but it was unique in its on right, and I enjoyed reading this account of the woman with multiple personality disorder."
5,excellent,"""The Flock"" was one of the best books I've ever read. I'm very interested in Psychology and this book brings the disease so close to you. At first I thought it would be confusing to follow because there are many so personalities but it wasn't at all. The story is told from a personalities point of view. I was shocked when I read that some doctors don't believe in MPD. Well, Ido and I want to study Psychology some day!PS: read this book! It's awsome!"
4,The single best book I've read on the subject,"The subject line says it all. It is well-written, and the authors stick to the facts of the case as they were written, making SYBIL look like a relatively healthy patient. I was also fascinated by the fact that Ms. Casey had trouble convincing other ""experts"" of the truth of her diagnosis. The bond she and Ms. Wilson develop is a bond I envy, in a way. Finally, this book proves that MD-level psychiatrists are not the only ones who can treat DID successfully."
2,Least interesting and helpful book on the subject thus far,"I have read many books on MPD/DID, and this one is the least interesting and helpful thus far. I do not wish to take any personal jabs at the author, however, MPD/DID is obviously not her only disorder. By the time you get to the end of the book and read about more post-healing ""tragedies"" and abuse, one gets the feeling that the author thrives on such drama. When people write autobigraphies, they take the reader into their world. I do not wish to be dragged into this author's world. It's not about happy endings, but it is about wanting to read truly good books written by truly healthy people who have truly overcome."
3,"Co-Dependence, Anyone?","This one's a little different. First, it is written not by the core personality, but by one of her alters. Secondly, the therapist's own notes are interjected through out in an attempt to show you both sides of the story. The main difference, however, comes from the style of therapy Casey and Wilson engage in: serious re-parenting. Personally, it went to such an extreme that I thought it was unhealthy. Yes, I want to trust my own therapist, but I fail to see how becoming a frequent visitor in his house and treating him like a pseudo-father figure would benefit either of us. Boundaries are very, very flimsy here, nearly to the point of co-dependence.That said, The Flock is a decent read. The story is involving, even if completely impossible for any multiple I know to identify with. No one I know will ever receive such therapy. In fact, I'm not sure that they should."
5,Fascinating and truly believable,"This book has been criticized (in the MPD community) as being unrealistic in the context of The Flock's treatment (essentially she was reparented). Nonetheless I think it's valuable to read for many reasons. Besides, who wouldn't want to be reparented? (sure seems to work quicker!) The author's choice of de-emphasizing the abuse descriptions (there are no graphic descriptions of abuse in this book) provides us with the rare opportunity to focus on the treatment and the growth of the Flock over time. I also very much appreciated the less than optimal description of the integrated person - Joan Casey needed post-integration therapy to deal with some of your run of the mill issues of self-worth and destructive relationship patterns. (This is very real life! Integration is usually not the END and you live happily ever after. I was very happy to see this discussed and resolved so favorably in the end.)"
1,This calculator does not calculate accurately!,"I bought this calculator for my grandson to use in Beginning Algebra. He discovered almost immediately that it is unable to calculate negative numbers correctly. I contacted the manufacturer but was told that I should not be using this calculator for Algebra, that it was designed to calculate tax functions! Negative 5 x negative 5 is pretty simply arithmetic but this unit got the wrong answer."
2,Smaller than Amazon Claims,"Amazon describes this Sharp EL-377T calculator as being .7 x 4.5 x 7.1 inches and weighing 4 ounces.The actual size is: .4 x 2 5/8 x 4.5 inches and weighs 1.81 ounces.Not worth returning, but disappointed in Amazon."
1,This is terrible,I never knew someone could destroy music so well. Hopefully this guy has a day job. Do not waste your money on this.
3,"Great sound, but mechanically mediocre","I was very happy with this unit for a good two years. It replaced the stock unit in my RSX and gave me great sound through my Bose speakers. However, after two years, the mechanical face flip started giving me problems. It would randomly get stuck and not flip down when I turned off my car, and there is no way to remove the face unless the motor pushes it down. I lived with this issue, but after a few more months, the jog dial knob broke off of the face. I'd say it has seen only moderate usage and no abuse, but the knob is made of cheap plastic. I am forced to use the remote now if I want to use the unit at all."
5,Loving this casing!,"I had bought a classy looking leather sleeve for my phone, but discovered that i was unable to make pictures with the phone in the sleeve. The sleeve is also bulky, which I don't like.I came across this boxwave suit and it adresses both problems. No bulk and picture taking ability."
4,Good Case,"This is a good case, I like it!Yes, It'll make the hardware buttons hard to press, but on the other side it protects your phone and the valuable screen. I really like it. The only thing I don't like is that after the seller send the item, I lost it (and DHL keeps telling me that is in transit), but it arrived like a week after.4 stars because indeed is a little overpriced"
2,OverPriced..,This case is overpriced for what it does. IT stretched after just 3 times of removing it and putting it back on. Makes majority of the hardware buttons very hard to press and kiss your auto focus good bye after you put this case on.Its worth it if its priced and around $5. Also it took the shipment almost a month to arrive.
4,Cover,"Very nice looking but stretches when you remove it from the phone a lot of times, and the audio doesn't fix with this"
4,Great Smoking Bisquettes,I bought these for my financee cause the price was so much better than from Cabela's. He hasn't used them yet but has used the same product in the past and really thinks they are the BEST. Happy Smoking.
1,Why don't I have my product yet!?!?!,"I ordered this just after thanks giving, in preparation for Xmas dinner. Well I'm doing the turkey without my apple chips.How does a product listed as IN STOCK not arrive after over two weeks?I love my smoker, but in the future I will order wood from a better vendor."
4,Great product,"Excellent method for smoking all types of food , do not use the applewood for smoking jerky though, the flavor is too mild."
3,"Average time travel, not worth the price","I really love time travel books and am easily able to forgive errors in history etc. if I am enjoying the story and the characters. However, this book was mediocre. I have tried to read it 5 times and finally just ended up skimming it. Even then, I still am not sure what happened, but since I paid full price for the book I really wanted to get through it. I don't think it is a bad book but rather an unmemorable one. It could be because there seems to be quite a bit of characters and names of things that I lost track of what was going on, then just kind a gave up. I wish I had enjoyed it, but it just wasn't worth 12.99. Maybe if you are curious and love time travels and Ireland you might want to give it a try if it is discounted."
4,Received Damaged Product,I like the Chimenea and think it is worth the money. The downside is that the package and product was damaged in shipment. One of the metal brackets that holds the loop handle to the Chimenea was broken. I don't know who to contact about this and the company's name and address was not on the box.
3,overpriced,"Yeah, they sound good, but not $400 good. They do block out sound nicely but that is purely attirbuted to the earbud foam. The connector is a terrible idea. I have worked in professional sound and still do not know why this would be useful. It is very bulky and pulls on the buds and feels unnatural when wearing these."
2,"sound quality is great, product quality isn't.","had mine for 27 months. loved the sound, but over the last 2 months, I've noticed more and more bad connections. well, today, they died. if I were a daily user I'd say great, but I wasn't. I used mainly for working out which was 3 to 4 times a week about 8 months each year. for this kind of money and needing to buy another set already, I am less than pleased."
3,great product bad company,"The earbuds work fine, if you dont mind having only 12 inches if wire to work with. the extension cable didnt work out of the box and Shure wouldnt send me one. Good luck on ever getting a response from Source Media Group. Amazon did the only thing they could do and gave me a return/refund. for the lack of Shure shipping me a 1$ cable they lost a 160$ sale and a customer for life"
3,Not worth the money,I bought them used so maybe that had something to do with it. Definitely has deep bass but the highs don't really get hit like other headphones I've used. It cuts out ALL noise which helps. I think the Beats headphones are much better sounding and definitely cheaper.
5,Audiophile quality earphones,"Excellent quality, high end sound but a bit expensive summarizes these earphones. Constructed of high quality materials, thicker than normal wiring, excellent connectors with form-fitting ear buds, it is built to last and take more than normal abuse. The sound spectrum is full and accurate without emphasis on any band. If you are wanting a boom box in an earphone, look elsewhere. These earphones have a similar sound quality to many high end speaker systems although the quality of the lower frequencies depends upon a snug fit in the ear. Sound isolation, although not important to me, is excellent. I own other higher priced earphones but find these to be the best for sound quality."
2,"It started off well, BUT...","I bought these back in 2007 and they were good for the most part. I did have an issue with the ear bud tending to ease out of my ear canal during workouts but that could have just been my own ears. In any case, that did get annoying after a while. I have noticed over the last few months, however, that my cord has cracked in several places and my left earphone cuts in and out. This is VERY upseting as I hoped they not have any issues with only three years of delicate, and I do mean DELICATE, usage. In terms of durability, I thought Shure would have done a better job designing these but I was mistaken. Reconsider these if you seek durable phones for your workouts!"
3,The pug Handbook,This book has beautiful pictures and good information but I thought that it will have more detailed information about skin care and problems of skin and fur.
5,A book for every Pug and future pug owners,"One of the best books for new, present and past owners of pugs. Onecan start anywhere in the book to gain good insight to pug perhaviorand other salient common issues"
1,Good intentions but deathly boaring,"All monotone naration, no interviews or interaction with riders, mediocre footage. film maker should watch endless summer or dust to glory for a good example. Dont waste your money."
3,"Just The Facts, Bard!","A real basic introduction to Shakespeare. Burton wants to stick to the facts and to avoid over-speculation. At first he seems to succeed, and his easy-to-read objective prose supports him; and then you begin to notice that he is referring to what Shakespeare thought, what Shakespeare intended, etc, to more than facts. But rather than chastizing Burton for being over-speculative about Shakespeare the man, I chastize him for being over-confident about what the facts mean.The portrait of Shakespeare that Burton paints is of a highly-competent business-and-family man (whose business was the Elizabethan stage). If this seems incomplete, it's because the facts are incomplete: a few legal and business documents, some performance and publication dates, and various births, marriages, and deaths."
1,Save your money,"Save your money. The book is light on science and specifics and seems to spend a lot of time on things that do not seem to be related to either nanotechnology or homeland security. For example, they talk about and have a picture of nanotechnology-enhanced stain resistant pants from Eddie Bauer. If your looking for the latest on nanotech, better to read Smalltimes."
1,Bound for the Discount Rack,"I'm glad I got this as a gift as I certaily wouldn't have paid for it. If you want to read it take my advice and wait a year. It's bound to end up in the dollar bin, and you're bound to find dozens of used copies showing up on amazon."
5,Louie Devito is off the hook,I am speechless L.D is the best the way he mixes i have been a fan for almost 2 years i can't get enough of him he comes to one of the hotest clubs in Providence Rhode Island and it is crazy when he is there L.D is the bomb i can't wait till his next cd comes out i loved dance diva's i bought it the day it came out and track number 5 love it
4,Turning point for club music,"I actually love this CD. Devito changes the landscape of dance music with this one release. Sure it's missing some of the best songs played in clubs in 2000, but summer wasn't complete without Zombie Nation, Sandstorm, or the amazing operatic Spente la Stelle. Personally, just buy this for the Black Legend version of Barry White's ""you see the touble with me"", simply amazing. It will make you forget ""I turn to you"" is on here."
3,so so effort here.,"this is ok cd to hear and dance here and there. i really HATE the 1st track, melanie C's ""i turn to you"". very whack! there's also the very artificial techno track ""zombie nation"" by kernkraft 400 which must be in about a 100 dance compilations i've seen already. it's tiresome. why is black legend's classic ""you see the trouble with me"" a paltry 3 minutes and 44 seconds? you are better off buying the maxisingle where there are longer versions. ditto with love bite's ""take your time"". i was gonna buy this cd because of black legend, love bite and emma shapplin but i'm gonna get the cd singles instead. you are better off too."
3,"Exciting at First, but Very Quickly a Bore.","""Patchy"" is the word to begin to describe Louie DeVito's ""NYC Underground 3,"" which at times sounds like a poor man's version of the Ministry of Sound compilations. Things get off to a promising start with Mel C's ""I Turn to You,"" and the dynamite ""Spente le Stelle"" by Emma Shaplin. The latter tune expertly merges opera with a flaming Hi-NRG groove that works surprisingly well. The rest of the collection, however, is as consistent as the cash flow in my checking account. We are later treated to the overlong and monotonous ""Final Chapter"" by Mike Macaluso. Similar tracks also weigh the album down somewhat. What works? We get a cool mix of the infectious ""Dive in the Pool"" by Barry Harris, and we get Dynamix's club anthem ""Don't Want Another Man."" Don't get me wrong; this mix isn't bad, but you have to press your ""skip"" button more than once to navigate your way to the good stuff on this uneven CD."
2,Caveat Emptor,"All the hits are here, but not the way I wanted to hear them. It just offers a little taste, but does not fulfill. With this selection of songs I'd expect so much better. I know this is Louie's mix but, his the mixing does not do the songs justice. He leaves out the best part of each song. For example, Sandstorm is cropped and has none of its defining ""build up"" . It just jumps into it. Same goes for kiss, I have to question the version. And really, how many other compilations can we find Zombie Nation on?"
2,poorly made,i hate fact that every song gets cut off before its over why would anyone make a cd like that?
2,Misleadingly titled Collection,"By general consensus, the all around best album Peggy Lee ever made, was the LP entitled ""Black Coffee"". The folks at Decca of course know it and that's why they've attached those two words to this collection. I bought it thinking to replace my LP and getting all the ""other delights"" into the bargain. However, corporate deception is alive and well. Of the original LP's 12 tracks (all marvels), only 4 are included here. A few more (mainly from the two albums ""Dream Street"" and ""Mr. Kelly's"") are also top drawer, but the rest, most of the first CD in fact, is forgettable-to-horrible.If you want her best album complete, together with one of her best (""Sea Shells"") on one CD, see Amazon's listing for it. But give this one a pass."
5,Great,My grandson loves Scooby-Doo and this one was a hit with him. Could watch it over and over. A good one.
1,Disappointed!!!,I rented this for my 5 year old son. We have fun renting Scooby movies from Amazon! I have been thrilled however this evening it stopped and skipped more times then we even bothered to count! This movie was also quite a bit more then the others! Please consider giving a credit to my account!
4,kids loved it,good entertainment for kidsjust make sure they are old enough to watch the wereworlf is scary to little ones
1,trivial content,"When reading a book/article written by professors, a reader is looking for content with deep thought. Obviously, this book does not belong to this category. It simply gathers some commone-sense tips and rephrases them, which any internet user can google them in a few hours.The title is also misleading. There is no way one can become a star perfomer by just following those tips. Call it ""become a good performer"" might be more accurate."
2,Common Sense for $15,"From a pair whose philosophical position states that there is no such thing as a star performer, this is an ironic title to be selling. Margot Lester's article ""Meet Your Deadlines with These Tips"" on Monster.com gives us a couple examples, and perhaps a little insight into why, in their world, it doesn't take anything exceptional to ""be a star"":Create and Maintain a Due List of All DeadlinesPlan and Schedule Your WorkNegotiate Due DatesLearn to Say No [to unreasonable deadlines]Ask for HelpNone are especially ground breaking. Lester also cites their final and seeming favorite, ""give no excuses."" If you didn't do it (and the others) when your mother told you, you don't need this book to start now."
2,Guitar histrionics,"Didn't like Brazil when it first came out but it grew on me. I have 4 other LAGQ titles beside GH and Brazil. GH is my least favorite of the bunch. Why? Because almost nothing is recognizable on this outing of covers paying tribute to guitar heroes. They just could not have picked more obscure songs. And then there is the sound. Nylon string guitars sound flat and stale anyway but this is just awful. I used the brightest sounding headphones I have, AKG K701's and it still sounds dull as a butter knife. There is just no crisp treble here at all.I read a review just like what I just wrote and ordered it anyway. Leave this one and get the rest."
2,I Should Have Known Better,"I'm a fan of Classical Guitar. I heard about this quartet and sought them out, buying ""Guitar Heroes"". I should have read the Amazon review more closely. If I had I would have earned these pieces are in a dissonant rock-style with little or no melodic form. A far cry from what I envisioned. I write this to warn other innocents who might be looking for melodic music in a classical style. I didn't read the review closely enough, but you should."
1,"does not work for 13"" MBA","STAY AWAY... Way to bog for 13"". It is bigger than the sleeve I use for my 15"" MBP. does not fit in my back pack like the 15"" and is useless. to return will be $12.95 shipping. add the 5.99 I paid to get it shipped to me, does not make it worth the return. wase of $$$$"
3,It's okay,"I choose this rate because is what a think about this product - The music of Michael carvin ""it's okay"""
2,Great product - TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I bought this lens in October and loved it. It's great when it works, but the manufacturing sucks, and the lens came apart in under a year. I sent it in for warranty repair and got a bill. I spent HOURS on the phone with Sigma's repair department and, after being passed around from technician to manager to Sales Manager, I was told they'd pay for the repair labor, but I had to pay for parts. They were totally unconcerned with customer satisfaction, totally unconcerned with the reputation of their equipment. They just weren't going to fix the problem with the piece of equipment I paid $800 for. Sigma makes a great product, but isn't at all concerned with customer Satisfaction"
5,TV THEME SING-ALONG BOOK,THIS BOOK IS JUST AS GREAT AS THE FIRST VOLUME. I REALLY ENJOYED THE TV THEMES AND COMMERCIAL JINGLES FROM THIS BOOK. I RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO ALL THE FANS OF CLASSIC TV SHOWS EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD!
5,a good book on an unusual subject,"The lyrics and melody, in musical notation, are provided for each TV show selected. We are also provided with a brief synopsis, a dramatis personae, statistics on how long the show ran and how it ranked, and a few trivia items.Before you buy from this listing, check the prices in the other listings."
4,Picture not accurate,"Description says ""Each piece is 3"" Diameter x "" Depth 2 cavities per mold."" but picture shows 4 cavities. I got a mold with only two.*Update: I was sent a new mold. It was the same size with two cavities and was still not the four cavity one I wanted, but I was happy enough to keep them and just make the extra large pops. Also it looks like they posted the right picture now. I now rate them 4 stars instead of 1"
2,Not full disclosure,"I was very disappointed to open my package from Amazon and discover that the hardcover book for which I had just paid $25 was missing its dust jacket. Unless I am mistaken that was not disclosed in the listing, and I feel that it should have been."
1,Horrible!,This is by far the worst sauce I've ever purchased of any kind. It reminded me more of Spaghetti-O's than Pad Thai.
1,"""Very Good Condition"" ?????? includes torn page?????","This is not so much a review of the book but rather a criticism of the condition of the book itself.In the purchase order the book was designated as ""in very good condition"".I was appalled to receive a book in ""very poor condition"" which included a torn page.It would be helpful in the future to have a realistic evaluation of the condition of the book or that Amazon would describe the criteria used for ""good"", ""very good"", etc.Thank you for the opportunity to voice my criticism and of course the disappointment is still felt.Sincerely,Paula Estorninho"
4,Slightly Stiff,"If you want a Cadillac ride these are not for you, but they are also better than the tooth jarring ride of ProComps monotube. I replaced worn Monroe Reflex shocks up from and Edlebrock in the rear of a Dakota, and I love that the ride is now balanced. The Edlebrocks were fine but not a good match to the worn out Reflex. My truck sits flat cornering and ride great at highway speed. At slow speeds the shock can be a little stiff on a cement road with busted seams, but they take speed bumps and dips with ease. Braking and cornering in my quad cab Dakota is so much better. These gave it it's confidence back."
4,Great shock but too stiff for me,Bought these for my 1999 F250 Super Duty 4x4. These are a great shock but just too stiff for me. The truck is stock and my off roading days are over so it is a pavement princess. Nothing against the shock. It appears well made and is perfect for a truck that gets off roaded or tows/ carrys heavy loads. I will be returning them and trying to get something more stock. Once again nothing against the shock its just too stiff for my old body.
5,Sacramentary by Catholic Book Publishing Co,"I LOVE THE Sacramentary BOOK MADE by Catholic Book Publishing CoIT'S GREAT FOR PRISTS, REVS, & PASTORS THIS BOOK IS REALLY MADE FOR THE CATHOLIC REVS, BUT IF YOU ARE CATHOILC BUT NOT A CATHOLIC PRIST/FR THEN THIS BOOK CAN BE USED TO FOLLOW THE ROMAN CATHOLIC RITE OF THE ORDER OF THE MASS ALSO YOU CAN THIS LOOK AT THE BOOK TO STUDY THE MASS IN IT-SELF"
3,An adventurous and intriguing speculative history,"I read this book from beginning to end, and enjoyed it. But it left me wishing I could find a more thoroughly documented, and more objective, work on the same subject. Even though I wanted to believe the author had a solid basis for his theme that he had discovered the true history of glassmaking before the Middle Ages, I didn't find his sources and his reasoning to be convincing.I had the same feeling when I had finished this book as I had when I finished John J. Robinson's speculative history that attempts to connect the origins of Freemasonry with the suppression of the Knights Templars in the early 1300s. It was an inspiring and attractive tale, but I couldn't go along with several of the key leaps of interpretation that were essential to its central theme. Too much speculation and too little solid evidence."
3,Reminds me of PBS,"This two-act play is obviously shot during a live performance , picture quality is sharp and reminds me of black and white films seen on PBS. The play is about Two gentlemen sitting on the roof top of Hope Memorial Cancer hospital (1979) . Parmegian is living with a diagnosis of cancer and Landau is waiting for a diagnosis of cancer. Parmegian an elderly man who I would describe as being annoying, bigoted, fatalistic, and a constant liar; forces Landau a controlled man to face his past as a holocaust survivor and in turn face life outside his comfortable bubble of artistic existence"
5,It`s Great,"I recently ordered Samsung 730B Syncmaster 17"" LCD Monitor to be included with my built from scratch PC. I have to say that the colour is bright and very vibrant. I dont regret buying it Plus I like Samsung brands"
5,Legally blind and loving this monitor,"I am legally blind and use a screen magnifier program so I need a monitor that has fast response time and a bright screen. Trust me; this monitor does that and so much more!I won't bore you with its specs, but it is very easy to adjust the screen brightness, the colors are vibrant and text is very sharp.Setup was a snap, and I regained a ton of desk space because the monitor is very thin and light weight.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase, and I bet you will be too.UPDATE: I heartily suggest you buy the Marine Aquarium Virtual Undersea Paradise screen saver. It is a great way to show off your new monitor, and those fish drive my cat crazy."
1,"Great monitor, dinky lifespan","I bought two SyncMaster 730b monitors a while back. I've been very happy with the monitors ... while they lasted.One died about 6 months ago, the other two days ago. I don't have the exact purchase date handy, but it seems to me that these things have died outside their warranty but WAY before their time.I was able to get a refurb to replace the first one and I've bought a used one to replace the most recently deceased, but I don't believe I'll be buying any further monitors from Samsung when these go."
3,Good LCD but too bright!,"I'm not a monitor or LCD aficionado/guru, but this is my experience:This Samsung LCD monitor works fine as a general purpose monitor, just like any other LCD or CRT monitor. I use the analog input and that works fine for me.This monitor also has a nice quick setting mode to switch contrast & brightness for the type of activity like custom, text, internet, game, sport, and movie.My one and only gripe about this LCD (and probably a lot of others, but this is the only one I bought to try/use) is that it is TOO BRIGHT!!! I guess most people like bright monitors and white screens, but not me, I'm old school and like the old black DOS command prompt. Changing the brightness/contrast doesn't help. It's either too bright or too dark. Can't find the just right setting.Next time I'm going for an LCD with a glare filter like glass display, like the HP ones, which are more like the laptop LCD screens which are less bright."
1,don't buy this monitor,This monitor is the worst I have used in recent times.The display is awefulIt is has no improvement even if you use a DVI cable(not shipped).
4,"Good Product, Easy Install, Good Price","Installed on my 07 Chevy Tahoe. Installation is easy, no drilling, but be sure and take your time. About $25 cheaper then any auto parts stores I checked with, and is a high quality product."
2,Acceptable price,"Amazon offers free shippment on this bike which caused my attention to buy it because as you guys know it's almost 50Lbs. The expected deliver date was on the 18th - 20th, but I received it on the 16th. That really impressed me.This bike kinda heavy but I admitted that it looks phat. However, I was having a problem to adjust the U-brake springs with its screws. Be sure you have all the tools, like 6mm, 5mm allens because it doesn't come with them in the shippment. The derailleur is not make in high quality materials that's what I wasn't expected. I think this bike was manufactured by Mongoose because it has its logo on it. Maybe that's why its MGX - MonGoose. The rear suspension is not the same as the picture shown on the web.In my opinion, I'd rather paid $20s more and get one with Shimano's shifter and derailleur at Target store because I think that is more valuable."
3,Not THAT impressive...,"I wasn't very impressed with this book and that surprised me, as Graham Masterton seems to be a highly recommended author. The only real character development was the main character's daily attire and there were some holes and weak spots in the plot. The book did give me the heebie-jeebies though, so I'll give it a couple of stars for that."
3,succeeds more as crime fiction than as horror,"I'd have to say that, for the most part, I enjoyed reading this novel. Masterton has a nice style of writing, and the details of Irish life, as well as the life of Detective Superintendent Katie Maguire and the bleakness of the story, were well conveyed. However, the killer remained pretty much an enigma, and there is insufficient occult detail and atmosphere for this to really qualify as a horror novel. The ending, while it delivered some neat surprises (including one involving The Lusitania which is particularly well done), did not carry sufficient weight for what is supposed to be an earth-shaking event, and left me feeling a little cheated and unfulfilled. Masterton is a good writer, but his story needed a bit more work to be truly memorable."
3,Not very stable,"I ordered this item when the product description said it comes with the free motor drive, and it did not come with it, I had to return the scope because I wouldn't have purchased it otherwise. In the short time I used it, the scope was hard for me to use because I'm not used to the EQ mount and the tripod seemed flimsy and unstable making it hard to view things. The knobs and dials seemed clunky and a bit cheap which is understandable given the price point. The actual optical tube itself was huge and metal and I'm sure it beats anything in its price range. The mount though its the weak point, the knobs and dials, counterweight, etc all bump into each other which made it hard for me to point it where I wanted. I was concerned the counter weight would slide off and land on my foot too. Overall I would recommend saving for a higher end Celestron SE goto scope intsead of getting this one."
4,Not bad for the price ...,"Assembly took about 15 minutes to complete despite instructional pics being the size of a postage stamp. Distant images during daylight were nice. The telescope itself would rate 5 stars to me due to it's clear images and great price. The attached finder's scope is ridiculous, but I solved that problem by replacing it."
4,Good telescope for upgrading,"The Telescope and mount are high quality, but the accessories it comes with are almost useless. The two eyepieces and the Barlow lenses are made of plastic and aren't fully multi-coated. The 20mm eyepiece is useful for terrestrial viewing, but is not threaded for filters. The 4mm eyepiece has a tiny eye relief so that you eye has to almost be touching the eyepiece, and it is the only eyepiece threaded for filters. Also with this eyepiece when you even touch the telescope it makes the image blur, to stop this get it aligned with what you are are viewing then just not touch the telescope, to let the vibrations stop so you can see what you want to see. The finder scope is useful, but will be knocked out of alignment by a small bump, so if you bump it during the night it will be very difficult to realign, and your are pretty much done viewing for the night. All in all my advice is to get this telescope, and also get some high quality eyepieces and Barlow lenses."
1,did not see anything,I purchased this telescope for my son but he had such a hard time finding anything to focus on. Very hard to use
2,Deceptive ratings,"This telescope is like the transistor radios in the 60's, more numbers are better. Back then they would install totally nonfunctional transistors, and boast that they were 18 transistors (maybe 6 functional) and jack up the price.Celestron specifies 1000mm focal length, with a 700mm tube, this is impossible...magic? No.Add a lens at the bottom of the focuser, and voila ! But then you are only using the center 2/3 or less of the mirror, not the whole thing.Collumation (alignment)is impossible with this pig. Truly a POS"
1,Complaint,"After it arrived, we tryed to put it toghether and found out that one of the two brackets that mound the lens on the tripod were missing.My daughter in law has offered to contact the company. However this was a major disapointment."
3,"it's ok, but can of hard to use,",its very bulky and hard to line up but for the money you can see good detail through the 5 inch newton reflector mirrors
2,Celestron 127EQ review,"The scope is a little bigger and heavier than expected, works great for watching the moon and land objects, but as for watching planets you can forget it, quality of the 4MM eyepiece, Barlow lens, and finder scope, which are kind of worthless"
4,Overall good product,Could use better instructions on calibration.The telescope is solid and well -built.It's been hard to find accessories at the local stores. will go back online for more.
3,Checking out the solar system is fun!,This is an excellent way to view the heavas or a resonable price. The only drawback is that it is difficult to maneuver when the object is over 75 degrees elevation.
4,Not a bad telescope,"This is my first telescope i bought. It was easy to assemble, only took about 10-15 min. The power is good for a beginner. You can see jupiter's moons and the shadow on venus. If you buy this telescope i suggest getting a new barlow lense because the one that comes with it is terrible. Also get a new finder scope. It may look cool but its a piece of junk.The bottom line is that it is an overall good telescope"
3,"Nice Telescope, Tripod not so nice","The directions for putting this together aren't the best, it took us way too long to figure it out. When we took it outside at night when it was about -2 outside, the tripod started to slip from the aluminum shrinking and the telescope started to fall, so we both grabbed for it and reextended the leg and went to tighten it back up and the bracket snapped. Now we have to send it back and hopefully they will find it covered by the warranty and we'll get a new one. Not too happy with this part of it. We do like the telescope itself so far."
4,Beginers scope,"This is a beginners telescope it is great for mostlly moon and maybe planetary viewing . As all amature astronomers know eyepieces are a big part of how well a telescope performs optically, unfortunately lower priced telescopes like this one have poor quality eyepieces included. Personally i would not pay more than 100.00 including shipping for this particular model. If you want a real telescope check out the celestron nexstar SE models 5 & above.Pros: very good moon viewsDecent tripodNice apperture sizeAll metal partsReasonably priced if you paid less than 100.00 inc. ShippingCons: images can be blurry with the slightest wind or movementPoor quality eyepiecesViewfinder is uselessSlew controlls are plastic and flimsyOptics are so so but for the price cant complain"
3,Very good if the piece is good,The first piece was poor in visibility and has to get replaced with a another one. The other one was having very good visibility since beginning. Difficult to collimate if one does not have proper experience and/or tools. But very good for the price offered and for the people who know how to use the Equatorial mount. The new piece contained an erect view 20 mm eyepiece but is not as comfortable as the the old piece had 20 mm eyepiece with inverted view. The erect eyepiece I did not find good for astro-photography as well. So I retained the old eyepiece and returned the new eyepiece with the old telescope.I would have given 5 stars if the first piece were working good and would have given 1 star if both would not have worked good. I'm giving 3 stars as the first one has to return and second is working good.
4,Good Telescope,Good telescope. The view finder scope on top is not very accurate so it makes it difficult to find opbjects. Other than that is is great.
1,pain in the...,I bought this over a year ago and I still can't get the thing to work. It was hard to put together and I can't figure out what is wrong. I can't see a thing through it. I am giving it to my brother so that he can work on it to see what is wrong.
2,Good Moonscope for Noobs like Me...,"First: Read all reviews BEFORE you buy. ""Doing your homework"" is not the same as ""yeah I'll just read the positive reviews and buy this"". LET THE ""DISLIKE"" VOTES GET BIGGER NOW.Second: Everything said about the parts is true. Barlow, lenses, finder and (less so)the mount, are worthless.Third: Prepare to spend just as much for the ""real"" parts as the hole scope itself, maybe even more.Fourth: Even after spending about $200 on top of this, the best Jupiter looks is like a small dot (6.4mm plus nice Barlow also multi-coated),Fifth: If you are a total noob like me, you will only get enjoyment out of howlin' at the moon.YOU ARE WARNED.PS. Starry Night is so much better than the software they give you. I'm learning alot about astronomy through my books."
4,Sigma 24-70 f/2.8 for Canon EOS,"This lens seems to be quite a hefty build. I have owned it for a little over two months. I have used it to shoot a wedding as wells as two engagements. I cannot attest to any weather proofing. However, for everyday use, this lens was built to be able to handle the use of a serious shooter.UPDATEI have a few things to add. First of all, this lens is so noisy. Using this for weddings is actually hard for me to recommend. I am sure if I had calibrated this lens to my camera body, I wouldn't have had such a horrible time with front focusing, however, the noise factor of this camera is hard to get by. It really is that loud. Maybe if you are using this as a general purpose lens in normal situations, this lens is great stopped down. However, I think I will need to specifically say that I do not trust this lens in any situation that might necessitate high quality output."
5,thank you thank you,I thought season 3 and four was lost forever I am so happy to see the episodes again. Brings back great memories!
4,Love Scarecrow & Mrs King,"Though this season is not as good as the previous 3 seasons, we love this duo and their adventures. It would not be complete without having all 4 seasons."
4,Great show!,"I love the show and it was great to be able to watch the 4th season through our Wii, but it would sometimes reload or have a sketchy picture."
4,Compelling Memoir and Call to Action,"Child Seeking the Light is a passionate call to action interspersed amongst beautifully written and compelling autobiographical sketches from the author's childhood. A 1930s childhood marked by divorce, life in an orphanage and an institutionalized parent, Barbara Becker Donner's journey to healing is inspiring, and serves to illustrate her compelling argument for effective talk therapy."
4,A life journey from bare roots to blooms,"A compelling story of a traumatic childhood, told in such detail you can feel the pain and struggle. Touching poems interspersed throughout mirror the struggles faced by the author, and ultimately the problems we face as a society."
4,Child Seeking the Light: Life's Mountains,"The author has very touching, compelling and readable story about how one child coped with a childhood accentuated by trauma after age five. Then how she learned how to live constructive adult nurturing parental life. Next she challenges society (us) to help the millions of traumatized children growing up without a nurturing atmosphere. Perhaps boarding schools with nurturing parental atmosphere instead of yesterdays orphanages. Makes you think!"
3,Faith and love,"Back Cover description: Faith Hudson was falling in love with her husband! Her marriage was a disaster.Her husband was better off in Boston without her. It had been clear to her then, and it was even clearer now that she'd traveled west and made her home on a Texas ranch. She had no plans of ever returning.But Max Hudson wanted her back. It had taken him three years to find her, and he wasn't going home without her. It was a matter of principle...Until he realized he was more in love with the woman Faith had become than he ever could have imagined. And that love just might be what Faith needed all along.The previous book, TEMPTING A TEXAN, is where we met everyone but Max. TEXAS GOLD is a good story, I just hoped for a romance between Faith and the sheriff, but it is not to be. In this book, we find out Faith left/ran away from Max 3 years ago. This story is about their growth as adults, and what they find in each other that makes their love stronger"
3,Beautiful photography of one of LA's newest monuments,"This is certainly a beautiful book. The photographs contained herein offer the reader a glimpse inside of one of Los Angeles' newest monuments. Los Angeles offers visitors much in terms of architecture. Works by some of the world's premier architects are to be found. This particular book showcases one of the greatest projects of recent years. The photography and layout are impressive. I would have rated this book higher. However, the insufferable prose of Downey prevents me from giving it a higher rating."
1,Great Rysanek no compensation for other bad performances,"Rysanek is indeed a great Klytemnestra. Unfortunately, her contribution alone is insufficient to raise the level of this dreary performance, which is, above all, marred by Behrens incompetent performance of the title role. Apart from a few shiny top notes, Behrens fails to do justice to both the music and the drama. The other performers are mediocre, and the orchestral performance is uninspiring."
2,Bad casting on title role,"Whether this opera stands or falls depend on whether we've got the right soprano in the title part. Unfortunately, Hildegard Behrens' unstable voice and chaotic lower register have failed to do the title part any justice. She doesn't command the part. Rysanek will a great force as Klytemnestra and the other roles are competently taken. However, the orchestral balance isn't that good, so is the general standard of the recorded sound. I'd suggest those who're interested in this dramatic opera to look elsewhere."
2,Let down by Behrens,"The chief flaw in this set is Behren's Elektra. The singer does not possess the kind of voice for this killing role, and her singing is often bumpy and lacking in force (and dramatic venom). De Vol sounds nice as Chrysothemis, but no more than that, and Rysanek is quite impressive as Klytemnestra. The other roles are adequately taken, but the orchestral playing is flawed. Can't be recommended as a reference recording."
2,Not worth your money,"There's nothing really in this book that you wouldn't be able to find online after searching for awhile. I got this book because someone mentioned that it talked about a ""Festival of Loki"" which it doesn't, it says that August 31st is sacred to Loki and that's it, zero explanation beyond that. - That was about the only thing that you won't find online in this book.Then it's also got JUDEO-CHRISTIAN saints mixed in there too. I thought I ordered a book on Northern tradition, not middle eastern/Jewish tradition. I was very offended by that, it's like buying a book on Indian polytheism and finding out that much of the book is about voodoo/hoodoo.Pennik also soft-soaps the relationship between Paganism and Christianity to make it seem like they go together really well, even though he mentions the inquisition.Update: After reading the book all the way through, I have to say it's not completely and totally awful or devoid of content, I mean, there's a few sentences with substance. ;)"
1,Very poorly mass produced,"These were very disappointing. The pilot holes that were drilled for the cams were much too large and compromised the strength of the stool. One of these came with broken wood and the other had chipped wood. Clearly these were not going to stand the test of time. Save your money and try another brand. From what I hear, anything made with RUBBERWOOD is pretty strong, so look for products made from that."
5,Very nice relaxing Christmas music.,"Anyone who enjoys the work of Linn Barnes, Allison Hampton, and and Celtic music will enjoy this work."
4,Classic 70s prog from Australia,"Four Moments was one of those albums talked about reverently among progheads in the early days of the internet on places like rec.music.progressive, and as the years passed its legendary status grew. French label Musea was smart to snatch up the rights to this and the follow-up Windchase and get them back into circulation. This is symphonic prog painted with very wide brush strokes, loaded with huge melodies and bathed in washes of mellotron and Hammond organ. The vocals are solid and the rhythm section warm but precise. Think of Camel circa Moonmadness and you have a feel for the sound of this album, though SH were even more ear-friendly and less reliant on leads or solos. This is an easy recommendation for anyone with a soft spot for classic 70s prog."
2,What is the big deal about this band????,"This is one band that I guess I am totally missing the boat on. Yea, they have a lot of Mellotron, but so what? So do a lot of other mediocre prog bands. I keep hearing these guys being compared to Camel, and I just have to say, ""come on, give me a break""! Sebastian Hardie don't even hold a candle to Camel composition wise. While they do have an occasional pretty melody and some nice instrumental passages, as well as some nice guitar work, most of this stuff I find to be boring, and about as clichéd as progressive rock could possibly get. All-in-all they are just ho-hum nice and totally, totally overrated."
5,Great for under kids beds for sleepovers!,I bought this bed last year for my girls and they love it. They each have one under their beds for when they have friends spend the night. It also works great for camping. The cover is really soft and not slippery. It stays inflated for months and withstands jumping (we haven't had one pop yet!). I really like this product and would recommend it.
4,Beautiful But Broken!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. I recieved it within the time they estimated and it was beautiful except for being broken. The marble looked good and the size is perfect. The lid was broken right at the swivel point. When trying to return it using Amazons system it wouldn't let me exchange it just get a refund. Therefore I will not have this Christmas present now until after Christmas. The packaging was inadequetly done for shipping this item. The box was of correct size, but the packing material used was not surrounding the item and allowed it to get broke."
5,"Really well built salt mill, lid opens really smoothly","I'm happy I made this purchase. The divider was key, so I can keep my fleur de sel in the same place as my standard Kosher salt. I was nervous about the swivel lid, but it opens and shuts very easily. Most importantly, it stays in place once you've opened/closed it.Get your self a Peugeot pepper grinder, and your all set."
2,Openings Too Small,The salt box is lovely but it is divided into two compartments and it is difficult ot use my fingers to get salt or pepper out of it.
5,Use Every Day!,"I bought this 'salt box' about a year ago and I absolutely love it! I keep coarse sea salt on one side and coarsely ground pepper on the other. I used this everyday in kitchen food prep & cooking. It's stylish, easy to fill and take a pinch out of even with my big hands. Each side holds approximately 3/4 cup. The lid swivels effortlessly. I love this so much I bought a couple more and gave them as gifts."
4,Love the marble,"The marble is beautiful and heavy, but I did not realize it would be so large. I wish I would have bought the one like Alton Brown uses. This salt box is just too big and cumbersome."
4,Festival Award Winner Quasi-Documentary,"Full of gentle warmth and humor, and with an upbeat reggae score by Jimmy Cliff, this feature from the National Film Board of Canada's Alternative Drama program provides an intimate look at the lives of four Black teenagers in Montréal. Some of the issues examined include poverty, teenage pregnancy, racism, and the importance of having a community. [1986, 95 min 19 s]"
3,not great,"Fits right, decently comfortable. Good for those with average to narrow feet. Functionally they are decent shoes, but visually the pictures online do not show them correctly. These shoes are rather heavy, clunky to feel while you wear them, and although the inside of the shoe fits narrow feet well, the shoes (when you put them on) look extremely wide.Function: 3 starsVisual: 2 starsFeel: 2 stars"
3,good arrangements -- odd selections,"I suppose there will always be selections we wish would have been arranged instead of others(after all this is the Beatles) but this seems far to heavy on the bubble-gum era. Those tunes just don't work very well as instrumentals. There are maybe a dozen or so really nice arrangements though. The Harrison songs are very easy and well done -- same for come together, across the Universe, and long and winding road. the 'In my life'arrangements is horrible though - so if you mainly are after this song, look elsewhere. Nothing here challenging for an advanced classical guitarist -- and there is no tab. But for Christsakes, if you are a musician learn to read music -- it's not rocket science."
2,No Tab,"If you can read notation very well, this book is nice, because they are pleasant arrangements to listen to and play. However, the book does not come with tab, so may be difficult to use for many players."
1,What?,"When I ordered this book, I thought that it was tablature. When it got here, I found out that I was wrong. I can't read sheet music. This book sucks because I am stupid and ignorant."
3,my fault,I ordered the wrong size. These are not for toddlers-I had no idea. But they did make the return painless. The shoes looked nice enough.
4,Great Summer Swim Shoe,"My 6-year old was getting bloody, skinned toes after days in the pool and these saved the day! They were very comfortable and worked for the pools & lakes. They also didn't get too heavy and soggy with use. Really terrific."
1,Bruce Li in New Guinea,"This is the WORST movie I have ever seen, This beats out ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", and ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" for worst movie ever. Here is the plot: Bruce Li, a cheap rip-off of the real Bruce Lee, and his friend go to ""snake worship island"", where they find some strange natives. They fight,terrible fight scenes, then they meet up with the ""snake wizard"", who has the Princess of the island hostage, they fight, bruce eventually wins, and everything is O.K. But if you watch this movie, you will know just how bad it is, i.e. the fact that you see powerlines and old tin cans on the ""uncharted island, that only primative natives live on"", or the ""gorilla""(a man in a very cheap chinese monkey suit), or the dubbing(the worst that i have ever seen), or the pointless scenes of nudity that have nothing to do with the movie. If you want to see a terrible movie, watch this one, I ""collect"" terrible movies, and this is the crown jewel of my collection."
2,Bruce Li ate my Guineau Pig!,"By the time this film was made, Li's career had gone on a downhill slide. After the disasterous attempt at mixing Kung Fu movies with comedy (i.e:The Lama Avengers and Dragon Force),Li made this turkey!. Audiences worldwide found Kunfg Fu and Cannibalism do not mix and the sight of Bruce Li and Co running round New Guineau,single-handedly massacaring a tribe of blood thirsty cannibals was a sight for sore eyes!. The final 10 minute fight scene against Li and a cannibal that just so happens to be a master of the nunchaku is hilarious,although this scene is heavily censored in most remainding prints available. Stay well away from this one."
3,its not all that bad,"like people were saying on the reviews it's a bad movie it really is but its still watchable entertainment its mainly for people in to the 1970's style martial arts flick, don't expect anything more."
1,Bruce Li in New guinea,"Just coming back to say again, this is the WORST movie ever. Wow this movie is bad."
4,big crazy action!,"This is one of my favorite martial arts films of all time.the story line is written in such a meticulous fashion that no detail has been omitted. this is a story of love, betrayal, honor, and action. This is the perfect film for any youngsters who might be interested in pursuing a life in the martial arts. PURE GENIUS! The ONLY martial arts film that the whole family should see."
1,Mikaila is MiGAYla,"Mikaila's voice is quite good if one is looking for a digitally altered clichéd sound. However, her ugliness is so revolting that whenever one sees the image of her hideous face on the CD insert, an urge arises to attempt to gouge out one's eyes. This makes it unfortunate that the record company seems to be attepmting to market her for her looks. This deals the final blow to the already doomed career of this teeny-bopper's attempts at stardom."
2,Too young & nieve for me,"Makaila may have a great voice, actually she has a great voice, but she should use it for some better music. The lyrics to this song are catchy, but it's just too much for a 14 year old girl to handle. Brooke Allison is better but not great. Maybe Makaila will mature, but her single & album didn't sell good at all & didn't concure a good number at all on the Billboard charts. So that should tell you not to waste two bucks on this single when you could buy a much better 2 buck single. The single is colorful and cool, but the music is too cheesy & young for me. We've all heard the 'I'm in love with you' stuff enough. It's alright, but it sucks coming from this girl."
1,JUST WHAT WE NEED,Some skank wailing about how she is in love with two people! How unoriginal can you get?
3,she's only a child!,"i enjoy the song, but it's so hard listening to the hidden meaning behind the song. why? she's only 13! what the heck does she know about being in love, let alone being in love with two?? come on now. and her video? well, she makes Britney look downright innocent. it's sad really. she should have kept this song on the shelf until she matured."
3,Great for a starter mic but sounds muddy,"Got this mic to get started for live and studio work, worked out just fine but muffles the vocal a bit, did not provide the bright, large sound I was looking for. You get what you pay for."
3,There are better introductory choices,"I found this one disapointing. For example, they do a nice job very carefully and clearly distinguishing ""decidable"" and ""acceptable"" languages. Then they talk about languages Turing machines ""recognize"" without saying if these are acceptable or decidable or what. This kind of thing is frustrating. That said, I did learn things from this book. Many things are well covered. But if you buy one book, buy Sipser instead."
1,We always learn something from a book!,"In this case, the point to take home is how to not write a book. This book does the worst job of explaining concepts in computability and complexity theory. There is no intuition given behind any of the proofs. Moreover, the language is so bad (I mean way beyond being terse) that most of the times it takes longer to read than it would take to read from another decently written undergraduate text on the same topic/proof. Most of the proofs start with ""It is obvious"" when it is far from it. It is really sad that such a beautiful subject is treated in such a manner. It is even more sad (and surprising) to see that it is used as the main textbook in a course on complexity theory. I would recommend reading from Sipser or Papadimitriou."
1,Worst Book I Have Ever Used,There is zero formatting in this text - it looks like its just popped right out of latex and it is hard to read. Variables are defined early on in the book and then referenced 50 pages later and you have no idea what they are talking about. The overall organization is horrible and the writing is horrible. I ask that you don't buy it new if you need it for school simply because you'll regret supporting the author for this terrible thing.
2,Frustrating.,"Couldn't they have explained just a little more? I find this book maddening as I try to deciper sometimes cryptic assertions. And once I get stuck it seems I have nowhere to turn. It's not like the local library carries texts on this subject so there's not much easily available for me to supplement this book with, so I'm left to stare at the page for 3 days until I figure it out."
4,amazing dance tracks!!,a great album with amazing beats but the vocals are not soo good but otherwise the album is a great gift or if you want to try something new!!
3,"all about the Plasmic Honey mix, not the vocal,","Imagine the Barbra Streisand recorded, Barry Gibb written hit from 1980 made into a dance mix and the vocals completely Cher-roboted all the way through, and that's what you get. Not a dance diva song, more like a really hot slammin dance tune with really irritating synthesized vocals."
3,Good remixes,"Ariel is a Freestyle artist, who I think is fairly new to the music scene. I haven't heard of any other songs she has done. She perfroms in clubs around the NYC area. The CD has various remixes of her single, Woman in love. Its pretty good."
2,nice for travel and compact,"The curlers are compact and convenient for traveling. However, they did not heat up hot enough to give me hair curl. I need HOT Steam curles. I ended up using the curling iron after what little curl I got from these."
1,not great,"The curlers heat up fast and cool down faster. Plus becase the curlers have a soft covering, not rubery, they don't stick easly in the hair. The problem is made worse by the pins not being tight enough to keep the curlers in your hair."
1,Don't Bother . . .,"I bought these for travel purposes. I already own a Caruso Salon 30 Steam set, which are Fantastic and give me curls that I can sleep in and remain until the next morning. The Remington Travel Set is heavy. Too heavy for travelling. The rollers did not heat up very hot. They are also heavy and the metal clips do not hold the rollers in place very well. I got hardly any curl at all. Very disappointed. The unit contains 5 large and 5 medium rollers; not 5 large and 5 extra large as advertised. I'll stick to my Caruso Steam Rollers. They are #1 !"
1,Size of Curlers is Mislabeled,"These curlers are great if you are looking for compact but they are mislabeled. I have been using curlers for years and these curlers were small and medium in size not large and x-large as they are labeled on the box. Do not waste your money on these curlers if you have long, thick hair like I do."
3,Traveling Curls,My wife likes to have curls in her hair. She looks great with them. We were going on vacation and she wanted a product that both compact to fit in our luggage and easy to use. We found both in the Remington H-1022.
4,REALLY WORKS,IT CAN BE USE WITH DRIED OR ALMOST DRIED HAIR. IT REALLY WORKS. YOU GET BEAUTIFUL CURLS.
4,"Good quality and price for podcasting, with a caveat","Overall, I would rate this product highly. It works, with excellent sound quality at a super price. The carrying bag is a good perk too, but...my problem with it may be a mac problem. The microphone will randomly stop working and seems to happen with any updating of Mac software. The fix is simple, but annoying:Plug in your Plantronics headset, launch ""Audio MIDI Setup"" in your Utilities folder, make sure you select ""Plantronics"" in the Audio Input pull down menu, and disable the 'mute' checkbox.For further info, paste the following phrase into Google and click on the MacSpeech technical article:""We are caught in the middle since it was not something that could have been foreseen by MacSpeech""Try this before sending it back."
2,Marginal,"Well, all I can really say is the head set and microphone work and are adequate. The switch on the cord that mutes, doesn't work. Very disappointing as that is a very important feature and a reason I selected it. Sooooo I'll probably go to a local store and find something else. I would return this item, like I usually do if dissatisfied, but just don't have the energy to deal with it."
4,"Nice looking, works well with Mac","Pros: Looks nice, goes well with Mac. Long cord. Volume and mic control remote. Would rate sound quality as 3.5 out of 5. Used with Skype, integrates very well with the software. Lightweight, and very portable since you can fold it up and it even comes with a leatherette pouch.Cons: While being portable is a plus, the way it keeps collapsing is annoying. It should have a ""lock"" to keep hinge in place when you are using it. But it's just a minor thing, it shouldn't keep you from buying it."
5,Great Toy!,"Plush Sitting Marmoset 9""This is an excellent buy!Very realistic, soft comfy fur, not the scratchy stoff you find on some.My daughter loves this so much we had to search for other products from the same maker!The design of the legs hugs your childs waist when they are holding it, so they really feel like the Marmoset is hugging them back.Highly recommended."
5,Just for Fun,"My one year old grandaughter loves Periwinkle and they are almost impossible to find unles you look where you find the impossible....Amazon.com. It has very little educational value, other than teaching her where the nose, eyes and ears are but it has great comfort value. She sleeps with it at my house."
5,It's PERFECT,"I have this for my zen vplus and I use it walking, biking, lifting weights, & everything.- I love it.Contrary to the previous review, the snap should have nothing to do with the function. I put my zen into the case and snap it, and THEN turn it on. There is no need to remove it from the case after that until you need to charge it up.ALL of the functions are easily manipulated through the case & there are actual openings for most of the switches and buttons.Don't let the snap hold you back. This case is terrific.Mine is PINK :)"
4,Lots of Juicy Tidbits,"I have been reading this aloud with my kids, so I'm happy to say it is a CLEAN book, but it does have some really neat questions about the presidents' personal lives, such as their hobbies, family life, sports they played, school, military service, and so forth. I was really impressed with so much information about some of the lesser known presidents like Franklin Pierce and Millard Fillmore and others. Obviously the author likes collecting the really quirky bits of info that make history interesting. I gather the book must have been in print before the events of September 11 2001."
1,Not even a good coaster ... the hole is too big!,"Didn't Mom tell us that if you can't say anything good about someone, don't say anything at all? Is it possible that this is the most abused piece of advice in the history of man? Certainly there must be something good we can say about this waste of plastic...I've got it! SAVE THE KEEP CASE! It'll make a good spare. (Sorry, Mom, it's the best I can do.)I cannot leave this without adding this one point. The producers of this travesty obviously have no clue about what we are looking for in a space documentary. That much is clear. But the only coherent sequence in this mess was the Challenger tragedy. What were they thinking when they put it in this video? Not only is it totally out of place, it certainly should not have been used at the end! This is The Ultimate in bad taste!"
1,Worst DVD ever...,"This movie is SO bad, that you might consider buying it just for a good laugh. It's only $.... So, if you have a good sense of humor, and are able to laugh at stupid things, this is the DVD for you. Otherwise, I am sure that if you buy this DVD you won't even be able to watch the whole thing through even once.This DVD gets a whopping ZERO STARS! WHY OH WHY does Amazon not allow a zero star rating?"
1,"Misleading, a big disappointment","Don't pay more than $5 for this DVD. Even then, you will get EXACTLY what you pay for it. Would be good for children under age 10 (maybe), but is difficult to navigate, no narration or subtitles to help viewer understand what they are seeing. My advice: pass on this one. I didn't, and I wish I had my $5 back."
1,1 disk was messed up and couldn't get in touch to get it replaced,"I like this series, I enjoyed the first disk and then the second disk showed one episode and then the next 4 or so episode wouldn't play, it was scratched badly. The other disk was okay but I feel cheated by the one disk being defective. THE SERIES IS A GOOD ONE AND I ENJOY WATCHING THE DVDS WHEN THEY WORK RIGHT. I HAVE THE FIRST AND THE FIFTH SERIES, THE FIRST WORKED FINE AND I ONLY GOT FIFTH SEASON SO I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANGE TO SEE IF THEY PLAY OKAY."
5,Earth Final Conflict Season 2 Was Excellent,"This season was never released in the U.S. by the distribution company. All of the rest of the seasons were released by the distributer (1) or the Canadian production Company (3, 4, 5). It is good to see it out. It fills in the hole between the ""what is going on"" first season and the last three which ended up being an overdone ""war between the female lead and the aliens"".It is great to finally have it available."
4,The Kingmaker,"Brian Haig makes The Kingmaker another book you are unable to put down. His main character, Sean Drummond, takes you through his client interviews and investigations with characters you'd love to meet. Great find!"
4,I love Brian Haig's books!,His books are fantastic! They are like a cross between a John Grisham novel and a Nelson Demille novel. Check them out! Start with Secret Sanctions - I believe that's the first one.
2,Junk reading at best,"Brian Haig is the son of Alexander (""I am in charge"" Haig. That explains a lot about this series. I only read The Kingmaker and that was enough. Even giving it two stars is a stretch. The whole plot is contrived beyond belief. The ""action"" scenes make no sense and the relationship among the characters is problematic at best. Really there are much better books even in this genre. Better yet, read Dickens."
5,"Finally, a teen mystery with a male protagonist!","Will Lansa is not your typical high school football hero. He proves to be a sensitive young man who relies on his Hopi heritage to help him solve the murder of his girlfriend. This novel provided a good balance of teen problems regarding heritage, romance, drug abuse, and friendships. I would highly recommend that all of you kids who like a good suspenseful mystery read this one. (I am an English teacher, so I love recommending good reads!)"
5,The Best Middle School mystery!,"This is a realistic mystery for middle school students. It is simple enough for kids to ""get"" in in terms of the genre, but complex enough for them to get to the end and have them say, ""Huh? How did THAT happen? I missed it!"" and then, gets them to REREAD it to find out where they missed the clues. This is the most stolen book in my classroom - a sure sign of its popularity. Will somebody PLEASE reissue this book?"
2,Hawk Moon,"Yo this book was so boring i dont know why i even picked this book off the self anyways. the first reason was my teacher Mrs.J made me take it cause we was running out of time. Anyways when i first was reading it, it was kinda good you know i wa all into until i found out that the dude was sorry at football. So i'll holla cause i only read a couple of pages so till next time HOLLA'ZEE"
3,Pure Victorian Romance,"John Strangeways lives the life of a country Gentleman farmer with his puritan brother in the hills of Cumberland. When actress Louise Maurel's car breaks down near their farm, she is forced to seek refuge with the misogynist brothers. Love ensues.John leaves his home to go to London, where he meets many people and situations contrary to his prejudices. Louise's patron and would-be lover Prince de Seyre is Strangeways competitor for Louise's hand. Some wonderful minor characters aid the story.This is a pure Victorian romance, strange morals and all."
1,Don't bother,I read and fully enjoyed Dreamweaver MX HOT and got through it in 2 days flat not a problem. Got this as it is by the same author and the same cannot be said for this title. The examples are flawed in a good number of cases....procedures are missed out and many examples just don't work (try the masking a bitmap with text which they even supplied a full example for on the CD and following to the letter the text dissapears) I am a qualified lecturer in the implementation of software and this book has done nothing but frustrate me
4,an attractive case,"I bought this case because the case that came with my clarinet had very little storage space for accessories. This one has plenty of room, which is great. Don't expect to put your sheet music in here because it's not that big! I appreciate the shoulder strap which the original box did not have. My only complaint is that when I have the case open to put away my clarinet, it has a tendancy to flop shut which is very annoying. I have only had this case for 2 months, so I bet I will figure out exactly how to drape the shoulder strap behind the lid so it stays open but doesn't tip the whole thing backwards. I got the brown/black one. Love the way it looks. All in all, I am glad I got this case."
3,Protec Clarinet Case,"I wanted a good case to protect my Buffett ""Prestige"" Bb clarinet away from the double case of the pair.This case is quite well made with plenty of space for reeds, cutter, cleaning cloth etc in the outside pocket. It seems to be well made to protect the clarinet from harm and has a strong shoulder strap.The less than perfect points are -- the interior 'pockets' for the different sections of clarinet are not as soft and 'luxuriant' as other brands and on opening the case to access the clarinet the lid wants to fall closed - both of these negatives are small and overall I think this case could be one of the best options on the market so far?Let's Dance Big Band."
2,Do you know EXACTLY how much 15 ml is?,"My wife tells me this eye cream works very well. The 15 ml container is an extremely small vial and NOT the much bigger jar shown in the photo above the ""15 ml"" product description. My wife gave me her Jar and asked me to order more for her. I found a photo of the jar, ordered, and recieved the vial. Ok, my fault for having a light grasp on metric volumes. The seller should have a photo of a vial above the 15 ml description.Again, I understand this Vtae product works very well."
1,Retreads,"This review is based mainly on the 7.2 Bible, although I checked the 7.3 in the bookstore to see if it had improved much. The 7.2 was basically old shallow material, with some paragraphs about stuff that had changed. I looked up PAM: ""see Pluggable Authentication Module"", look up the latter: ""p. 588"". On p. 588 there is one useless sentence on the subject! I looked in the index for ""usb"", which has been available in the kernel for a couple revs. Nary a word. I had two boot failures, and the book was useless on dealing with either one. My CD wouldn't mount: the CD troubleshooting section suggests rebuilding the kernel and never mentions trying a different jumper setting on the CD hardware (thank you, web!). Look elsewhere!"
4,An average red hat book,"Overall, i am happy with this reference book. It have guided me through many networking in Red Hat. Unfortunately, the author did not take a further step in explaining many important configuration in networking. Many times i have been left limboing and figure things out myself. It does gave a good start and I am still using this book even in my Red Hat 9 now.EQ"
2,not the greatest,"I've been messing with this book for a while and have three main points to share. First, the index is very skimpy. That may not sound like much, but it always disappoints me, and with a book of over 1000 pages, it's crucial for finding key information. Second, the book provides very little assistance when encountering difficulty installing the OS. And third, and most painful, the installation CDs were faulty (at least in my copy). If I try to install anything but the minimal of systems, CD #2 starts hissing and coughing. The installer says it can't read the disk, and everything quits.I gave this 2 stars rather than one because my first two points are not critical, and the third is most likely an issue with my particular copy, not the book as a whole."
3,OK for a reference,"I found this book to be fairly decent for a reference, if you are only looking to perform tasks through a gui interface.Very light on command line, which is the workhorse of Linux.By far, O'Reilly is the best source for Linux/Unix books."
5,Beautiful collar - and all the jewels are still intact!,"I have a female black and tan Border Terrier. The usual pink collars for females just don't seem right for her coloring. I liked the color and design of this one, and it seemed to be of a high quality. I'd read reviews on less expensive collars where the jewels fell out. I was very pleased when I received this one. It's very stylish and seems feminine enough for our little B. G. - originally Baby Girl, occasionally Bad Girl! (Just kidding.) She's been wearing it several weeks, and the jewels are all still intact. Do measure though. I thought 12 in. would be plenty, but I had to use the last hole. My mistake, and it doesn't detract from the quality. She's about 10 pounds with a slender build, and I don't think she'll grow any more, so it doesn't matter. I would think the animal print would work for a male as well. I would definitely purchase this brand again."
1,Buy different headphones!,"I bought these headphones because they are bigger than the ones I have and thought the sound would be clearer. Well, it was, until the tiny wire snapped and there go the headphones. The wires that lead into the headphones are too small to accomodate the heavy headset. Look for another if you want long lasting headphones."
4,Great Headphones,"These are really great headphones. Excellent for anything with a good strong beat (such as HipHop songs). The only reason it didnt get a 5 stars was because the cable length (even though it has the cable thing for it) is a bit too long, and feels useless."
3,"Great headphones, just wish they lasted longer","These headphones were my main set for use for the past year. Immediately I was very pleased with the rich bass and crisp treble these phones produce. They were also quite comfortable, they had an open air design but I never had much of a problem hearing my music in noisy places as I do with most headphones.My main gripe is durability. Recently the sound went out in the left channel, and when I inspected the set the wire had fallen off the left side. For just barely a year of use (and not heavy use) I had to get rid of them? Would I buy another pair? Probably not, unless they came with a lifetimes warranty."
4,Hearing Aid use w/Sennheiser HD 457 Headphones,"I have two sets of hearing aids. One BTE and one ITE. These headphones work wery well w/ITE aids, but don't ask me why. I really enjoy these headphones with my 30 GB iPod especially. If it matters to anyone, I am an active octogenarian and a former music instructor. I like 'em."
2,uncomfortable and disappointing,"Well, everything is relative and headphones (and speakers) are very subjective items, but I was pretty disappointed after getting these for use with my iPod. First off, as someone else mentioned, your ears get really hot when wearing these. I think that it's partly because it seems to squeeze your head a bit.Soundwise: for $30 it's in some ways better than, say, the iPod earbuds, however I found the bass so muddy and so distorted, that it's tough to listen to these things. For some music (say techno), it might be fine. For music with bass guitar, I found that the bass was often just a big mush.Also, I should qualify all of this by saying that I often use a $300 pair of Sennheiser HD-600's. So I may have been ruined by good sound, but I find the iPod earbuds listenable and not these headphones.I'm hoping that you can do better for under $50, but I'm not sure where."
3,NTA,"When I first got these I would have given these bad boys a 4-5 stars. However, after a few weeks the damn things started crackling in the higher octaves. bummer. I will not be replacing this pair with another set of 457's....Maybe I'll try the 497's...But if they fail I'll re-think ever buying Sennheiser again."
4,Not Sound Savvy But..,These are very confortable and have better sound than the ear buds I was using. They're adjustable and I think it was a good purchase. Only complant is that they don't cup the ear so they don't keep noise out as well.
1,These are Super Bass headphones,"If you like way too much bass then these headphones are for you. Otherwise get something else. I will be returning these for that reason only, otherwise they are OK (made in China, real Sennheisers are made in Germany)."
2,low quality,"I recently purchased these headphones and must say that I am dissapointed with their sound quality. While the range and volume is fine--bass response is ok and highs play without distortion--the overall sound is muddled. The sound is not crisp and clear. Rather, it sounds as if my music has already passed through some heavy object before reaching my ears. There is no problem understanding the music, don't get me wrong. Compared to the Coby headphones (bought at around the same price) that I was trying to replace, however, these headphones are simply not very good. I think Sennheiser makes good headphones, but I wouldn't waste any money on these. If you want a pair of Sennheisers, pay a little more to get one of their better models."
2,"Good sound, very uncomfortable.","I used to work at a radio at my university, where I often wore these for several hours at a time. There were barely any padding and my ears were always sore after use. Good sound of course, they're Sennheiser. But find something else if you want to enjoy your music, comfortably."
4,HOT product,"these headphones are HOT in several ways...1) warm bass, clear treble. the sound's hot2) for the price... it's even hotter3) your ears get pretty hot... within 10 minutes of using the product."
2,"good sound, not much else to recommend it.","The sound quality of these headphones is very good. Clear, no distortion.Unfortunately, the headphones feel very cheap, the adjustable ear pieces very awkward to use.The headband itself is not adjustable and is on the small side.After having these headphones on for only a short amount of time they started to hurt my ears and became very uncomfortable."
4,Very comfortable; great value,"Love these things. Bought my first pair in Germany in 2003 and I still have them in 2010. I'm buying another pair from Amazon so I have a spare, since a child has decided that chewing the cord is a good idea. The things I love the most about these are the long cord, the comfortable fit after many hours and the great sound. Highly recommend!"
4,Sennheiser Headphones,These headphones have GREAT sound quality. Super long cord if you like it. The only downfall is after an hour my ears started to hurt but everybody's head is a different shape! Overall a good deal!!
1,Way too much bass,"I've owned and used Sennheiser headphones since the 70s. These are by far the worst Sennheisers I've owned. Put simply: they are way too bass heavy. And it's not even punchy bass, it's real boomy and muddy. You'll need to EQ the bass down just about as low as you can to get accurate musical reproduction. If you like unnatural, overemphasized, boomy bass these are the headphones for you. If not, stay away."
3,Tiny head article.,"The sound is fine and they are very light. Unfortunately they are light becauseSennheiser didn't use enough plastic to make the phones large enough for most heads. These things are really small.If you are anywhere above size 7 hat, try something else"
2,"Good sound but poor materials, and you need to have a VERY small head.","Very good sound but the materials are cheap and noisy. Also, they were deign for a head of a 8 year old child; way too tight."
4,Good headphones for the price.,"These headphones are a great choice for the buyer on a budget. The sound quality is great, they're super comfortable with the felt lining, and as far as I can tell they're very durable.t. It is EXTREMELY long and to tie it up sennheiser includes a bulky oval-shaped thingy that you wrap the cord around. On top of that, at the area where the cord enters the headphones the casing seems to be splitting. Nothing that destroys the cvalue of the thing, but still detracts from the cosmetic.Overall, worthy buy. Can't go wron with such a good pair at such a low price."
4,"Love the sound, hate the wire","I bought these headphones at 100 bucks a pop a few years back after reading reviews of them on an audiophile forum. I wasn't disappointed one bit.I used them for a few years with my iPod, my Zen Vision, and even on my computer. The sound was spectacular and I spent many a night listening to FLAC audio on them.Then a few weeks back the wire snapped. I had been meticulous in my care of these headphones so it definitely wasn't my fault. The problem is that the wire is VERY thin and the headphones themselves are kind of bulky. Oh well.Now I'm mourning my loss and debating on buying another pair."
2,This book is scary.,"I feel this book can be a bit scary to children. My 4 year old was frightened after reading this book because he learned germs were everywhere that he felt used to be safe, his school and home. True, germs are everywhere and we do need to teach children to wash their hands, but I don't think it's necessary to get into detailled descriptions of germs that cause headaches, earaches, fevers and throwing up, and that even after washing their hands, the germs will come back. Children need to know about handwashing and germs but they also need to feel a sense of security and well being in school in order for it to be a positive experience."
5,"germs are real... kids need to learn about them,... this is a great way to learn","great book, kids stayed interested, It was fun to read to my group.. Im sure it will be a favorite!"
1,shipping disaster,"when the telescope arrived at my home, I was excited until I opened the package it was loosely shipped in. The dew shield was split and parts of the scope was falling out of the package it was shipped in. The tripod has a dent in it. I am very unhappy with this situation and no one has contacted me about this so far. I want a new dew shield and a new tripod. I do not care to order anything large if this is what I an going to expect."
4,Hard to find at box stores,Typically box stores and even the local hardware store only carry a sanitary tee. That's not the proper fitting for a double vanity install. This item is. It will be very difficult to snake a double sanitary tee. This item makes it possible. Nothing to complain about here. I used this for a back-to-back vanity setup for two bathrooms.
4,I wouldn't dream of using anthing else,I have been using this product ever since my sister suggested it. My hair has been soft even between long dry months. I believe this conditioner has even helped carry my hair through those times when I didn't get a haircut for over 6 months. And it still looked shiny and clean. So needless to say I love Pureology's products and I love the fact that they are vegan. Long live animals...humans included.
5,Fantastic Conditioner,"This conditioner has been rated very high, because it makes one's head tingle leaving one with a completely refreshed and revitalized feeling. The conditioner has a pleasant smell and is very rich, leaving the hair in great condition after application. Highly recommended for both males and females, as the scent is neutral."
5,Love this stuff!,"It makes my hair look good and feel good and it's not tested on animals! I only buy products from companies that don't torture animals in cruel experiments. For anyone who is interested, you can get more info at [...] or [...]. Animals shouldn't have to suffer and die so we can look good."
5,scalp tingle,A little goes a long way- your hair is silky & your scalp tingles & smells like menthol.
5,excellent product,"This product is great for color treated hair. I have used other products that are designed for color treated hair, but this brand produces much less fading than other brands. My hair is also much healthier as well. My hairstylist is amazed at how healty my hair is despite coloring my hair."
1,Appears to be a knock off,"I love this conditioner by Pureology, leaves my hair silky soft but still with body and most important, keeps my hair coloring from fading. HOWEVER, the bottle I received from Amazon was NOT the real thing. It is cheaper than in the salon, but when you consider how much professional hair coloring is, this is no bargain. My hair color began to fade shortly after starting this bottle and when I looked at the bottle close up, I realized that it was different than the Pureology I buy at the stylist's shop. The labeling was not embossed directly on the bottle but was clear stickers stuck to the bottle. I have never seen this before. Looks very much like the real thing, but after watching my hair lose it's color I tossed it. The fragrance is a little different, too. Will NOT order this item from Amazon again."
2,pureology Hydrate Conditioner,I didn't like the smell and it didn't do a thing for my hair. My hair is still dull and dry as it was before I used the stuff but please understand that not everyone has the same needs as others. I wouldn't recommend it for me but it might work wonders for you.
3,Vacillation!,"When I first began to use Pureology products about a year ago, I was impressed with their efficacy. However, as I am now approaching our anniversary, I am somewhat less impressed. I have discovered that WHERE I buy the product is important. Amazon is first-rate, but buying via a supermarket is not as reliable. These products are dreadfully expensive, and if you are on a very tight budget (aren't we all?), then you should think carefully about purchasing them."
1,Not an authentic product,"I thought that I was getting a good deal, with added convenience. Turns out this product is a fake. It smells similar but not as strong. The true test was the effect on my hair. I've been using it for over a month and my hair has suffered. I have used Pureology for 8 years and I know the wonderful things it does for my hair. Not the case after using this product. To truely test my theory I purchased another bottle of the exact type of Pureology at Ulta and used it today. In ONE day I could immediately tell the difference. Spend and extra $10 and buy your Pureology in a salon where it is guaranteed to be genuine."
1,If you have asthma or allergies beware!!!,"I have used this brand before but not this exact shampoo and loved it. The minute I put in my hand to shampoo my hair, my eyes started burning and the smell is so bad that I had to wash my hair again with another shampoo.This is just awful."
3,not all the way full but amazing conditioner.,"Positive:My roommate use's this stuff and swore by it. So I tried it and love it. It has a great mint smell and works like a charm, which is saying something because I have very fine soft hair and it gets tangled just looking at it. I have tried many different products and most have not worked and if they did it was the conditioner that came with hair dying stuff. So I got this on line to save a little money I'm not sure what the price is at the stores but I'm sure it is more.Shipping: very fast I got it in a few daysNegative:The first time I went to use it I noticed that there was lots of room for air in it. The product was all most 2 inches below the top. Now maybe I got one that just happened to be less full but I don't think that the amount is said in it was correct. I will buy one more time and if it is the same way I will just go to the store and buy it. Maybe that's why it is cheaper; they give out half full bottles.Over all I love the product"
5,"Love the mint smell and ""coolness"" during a shower","I have been a long time user of this conditioner and just started buying it from Amazon. I had no problems with the shipping or the quality of the product by not buying from a beauty salon store. One of my favorite features of this conditioner is the minty tingle! It feels so refreshing! Some of my friends have tried it and have not been so thrilled about the mint smell, but I don't think they were expecting it. The conditioner is also sulfate free (It's actually a vegan product!)"
2,"smells funny, strange consistancy","I've never used this type of Pureology before, but after reading reviews about the smell I thought I'd give it a go. I love the shampoo! Smells great! However, the conditioner smells totally different and the consistency is very thick and doesn't condition my hair well. I wondered why it smelled SO different from the shampoo...kind of a let down (considering the amount I paid)"
4,Met all expectations,I ordered this as a retro-memory-fun times gift for my sister for Christmas. It was just as we remembered when we were 8.
5,Amazing Value,"If super graphics are not that important to you, this game is amazing. I am not a fan of internet poker, and most games I've tried fall way short when it comes to being realistic. This game is just as frustrating/rewarding as real poker. It does need batteries, but it is worth it."
2,Horrible Graphics,The graphics on this product are horrible! Looks like something out of the 1980's. I was very unsatisfied w/ this product
1,Extremely disappointed,"I just bought this game and tried for 3 hours to make it work on 3 different t.v. sets - NO LUCK. I can't even give it 1 star because I don't know how fun it is (or might be). I tried every ""input"" available on every t.v., I tried changing the batteries, I tried hooking it directly to the t.v. as well as thru the VCR and DVD player - nothing worked. I guess I know why it only cost $5.99."
1,MORE BULLSH*T BOOTLEGGERS,"This is another product that's straight B.S. This ain't a screw tape, SCREWHEADS know wuz up and we all know this is trash, it's DJ Screw mixes but it's not a screw tape and these were the same bootleggers DJ Screw used to talk sh*t about on his tapes. DIARY OF THE ORIGINATOR is the real deal and the only CDs you can find in a real DJ SCREW store."
5,Ely's not a wannabe Tejano....he's the real thing,"The reviewer below not only doesn't ""get"" Ely's music, he also clearly doesn't know much about the singer's background. Ely has strong tejano roots, so his connection to the music is quite legitimate. This album is a quasi-concept album, and is a slight departure from Ely's usual fare. It was inspired by Cormac McCarthy's book All The Pretty Horses, and the producers of the movie (now in production) got wind of this and were smart enough to call on Mr. Ely to do soundtrack work on the forthcoming film. This album is one of Ely's best, and will make any exiled southwestern native (like myself) deeply homesick. Listen and enjoy."
4,An excellent blend of rootsy Americana,"In my opinion, Joe Ely reached the pinnacle of his long and critically- acclaimed career with this album (and he continues to scale the peaks with his latest, ""Twistin' in the Wind""). Combining elements of rock, country, and Tejano, seasoned liberally with flamenco guitar, Joe cooks up a great, satisfying album that meanders across much of the American music-scape."
4,Does it again.,"I must say you know this world is in trouble when Joe Ely isn't on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry CMA awards night in 1995 performing ""Gallo Del Cielo"" and sweeping the awards all for this CD.Unlike most Alt. Country artists, Ely has his own sound and style. He could sing anyones song's and make them his own.All songs here have a tex mex/cowboy flavor. I could have actually seen Marty Robbins releasing this album, if that says anything.Plus, I'm a stickler for good album artwork, and the cover of this Cd is a classic."
5,ELY AT HIS BEST,This is an outstanding recording. Easily his best since his self titled CD from 1977.
5,late night radio in NYC...,"I was driving home late one night from some party in NYC, alone and a little fried, it was about 1 am. The DJ on the radio started talking about this Joe Ely guy from Texas who had this great new CD out and then he played ALL JUST TO GET TO YOU with Bruce Springsteen chipping in with some background vocals. That was my intro to Joe Ely. The next afternoon after I finally woke up the first thing I did was go down to the nearest Tower Records and bought it. I still play it alot and rank it as one of my favorite cds. I love the country rock, unique sound he brings, awesome lyrics and guitar work. Hot!"
2,Lame collection from a great band.,"Typical of A&M's shabby treatment of it's domestic rock catalog (ie. Strawbs), this lame greatest hits collection is a huge disappointment. The remastering is weak, the song selection limited to a mere 12 cuts, and the liner notes should have been much more extensive. Procol Harum fans are running to their import retailers in massive numbers to buy the superior, recently remastered individual albums, complete with numerous bonus cuts. Guess A&M would rather not have our money these days..."
2,Slightl uses- not,"Enjoyed the music, but slightly used is not a term I would of used. Came with the library stickers all over it, and the use and misuse on the cd was very evident."
4,A&M Great Work,"I think that this cd is pretty cool i haven't heard it all but im sure it's great i bought this cd only because i heard the song A Whiter Shade Of Pale and it's a great tune i love it But i don't know why other people think that the label didnt do a good job but i don't know what other's think but i think the cd is olrite, I like it so far but just as long as it's not a jazz cd because then i would be dissapointed, But Procol Harum sounds like Steppenwolf and that's cool just as long as it sounds like any other artist i know, So that's olrite, But they also sound like David Bowie now David Bowie is great so i think that Procol Harum is cool."
5,Unreal,"The first time I saw the ""Always...Patsy Cline"" show live at the Ryman, I thought for sure Mandy was lip-synching to Patsy Cline recordings.After the fourth song, I realized it was just her - a tremendous voice and a tremendous talent."
4,Always....Patsy Cline,A wonderful tape. I am so sorry we missed the actual show.It was just as decribed and the transaction was very smooth.Thank You
5,GREAT SHOW!!!,"I just saw this show live today. This is a GREAT show! I thought it might get ""boring"" with so many songs. But, no way! Either go see the show, ""Always Patsy Cline"" and/or get this CD. Email: boland7214@aol."
5,Nothing else but briliant!,"I think Wrembel is the most gifted modern guitarist who plays Gypsy Jazz. It is not just the way he plays (he is good!) but also the way he feels the music which is really very rare... If you like this style of Jazz, this album is a must have."
4,Excellent...can't wait for a full album!,"This track is fantastic! I can't wait for the full HVB album in North America.The remixes are pretty damn cool, too.If you're into anything ""Prodigy/Chemical Brother/Crystal Method"" like, this is a good disc to pick up."
3,From a Monkee Fan who Cares:,"""One Man Shy"" Peter falls for a girl high above him on the ladder of social standing. Really adorable, if you love Peter as much I do. ""Monkees Marooned"" well, they're marooned and meet a washed up TV jungleman--who is wearing a leopard print leotard and it's really really frightening. But the first episode is worth it."
4,Great For Monkee Lovers...and Everybody Else!,"This is a great tape. Monkees Marooned is simply hilarious with a romp at the end to ""Daydream Beleiver"". One Man Shy is also adorable with Peter. These are, to me the funniest episodes. Wellworth it."
4,Great book!,"Donfried has done the Church Catholic a great service by pushing for the recovery of a Trinitarian hermeneutic in this book. The method he suggests provides a ""third way"" for Biblical interpretation other than the typical pitfalls of either the fundamentalism of the religious right, or the religious left's antinomianism and selective twisting of Scripture to placate the surrounding culture. All in all, a great read!"
3,"Good volume, bass hinders cds","I bought this thing a year ago to listen to at work. I work in a very large space and wanted to hear music in every corner of the place, and this unit does an excellent job with overall volume. The major drawback of this is with the subwoofer on, it vibrates the entire thing, causing the CD to skip. If you want to listen to just the radio or cassettes, this is an okay unit, but the G500, the newer version, is miles above in technology and I would expect this unit to be out of production soon."
5,fit perfectly thank you!,Purchased item on Amazon after looking all over in local hardware stores with no luck. Part fit and arrived in a quick manner. I installed the part and had no problems.
1,I was unhappy to hear this was a very old 2004 or 5 dictionary.,"It didn't say it was so old. I was sending it to someone in prison and when I heard they got it and it was a very old dictionary, I was very upset."
3,new but ruined,yes the book was brand new but the box i which the book was shipped in torn and so did the book and it was raing so the book got wet the book ws ruined and i was stuck with a new ugly book
5,"Cute, but Small","I wasn't paying attention to the size and overlooked how small it is. It's very small! But it's darling and as I purchased it for a photoshoot, it works perfectly."
3,some assembly required?,"This is a nice bike for tooling around the streets, but the assembly was a little more complicated than I expected. I ended up bringing the bike to a bike store (which I was hopiing to avoid by buying on -line) to make sure the bike was correctly assembled."
3,Met my expectations,"Purchased from Amazon based upon price. It was priced lower than at Sports Authority stores by far ($100 less than in store, $10 plus shipping less than their on-line price)and S.A. refused to match Amazon's price.Assembly, while not great on the directions, was pretty easy. Had it ready in less than a half hour including unpacking it.The gears are a little less than perfectly adjusted, have to play with the hand lever a bit to get it to hit in exactly the correct spot. Was slighly disappointed with the decals, one didn't last thru one car trip secured with a bungie cord (left marks in the decal) I'm also having a bit of trouble keeping the seat stem secured in its position dispite tightening the clip a few times. Have to keep trying to get that figured out. Overall, I like the bike and at this point I think the value is certainly there."
1,Buyer beware....,"Beware when buying this bicycle. I bought one of these for my daughter and it completely rusted out in less than a year. I would never buy another Mongoose bicycle,"
1,waste of time,"I am a huge tae bo fan and bought this thinking it would change up my regular routine. It is very disorganized and you end up waiting around for a long time in-between rounds. Also, Billy Blanks tends to the the same move for two rounds. It gets boring doing the same move for two minutes. I thought it would be a more high-energy/quick-moving workout, but it was a big disappointment. I felt like I didn't get a workout at all."
2,Tae bo let down,"I regularly do Tae Bo as a way to cross-train. When I saw this DVD, I was excited thinking it would be a fast-paced 30 minute work out. Wrong. Billy seems very disorganized as though he hadn't choreographed the work out ahead of time. With so many other quality Tae Bo workouts out there, I wouldn't suggest wasting your money (or time) on this one."
1,Gave it to charity,"I, like the other reviewers, was also very disappointed in this workout. I didn't feel like I had worked out at all, and don't ever recall breaking a sweat or really breathing heavily. I did it once and put it in my charity bag."
5,Great!!,"excellent, billy does not disappoint, this is a great 20-30 min workout if you dont have the time for a long intense workout session"
1,Not Good,I really like most of Billy Blanks work outs but this one was dreadful. I used it once and will never use it again. I wont even resell it as that would be horrible to do to someone else.
4,What more could a queen want?,"While ""To Wong Foo..."" is the perfect combination of drama and sexiness, it has some steep competition with ""Priscilla: Queen of the Desert"". However, it does hold it's own as a soundtrack loaded with all your favourite divas (i.e., Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper and Salt-N-Peppa) and some of their most famous hits. The only downside to the entire CD is the original score medley which brings the high energy down to almost nothingness (unlike ""Priscilla"" which contained bonus and extended remixes of the most memorable songs). Nevertheless, ""To Wong Foo..."" remains a must have for anyone who's ever dreamed of being a queen."
5,Great Movie=Great Album,I love this cd. The songs are versions that arent too easy to find and the movie is one of my all time favorites. This cd brings the feeling of the movie to you anywhere there is a cd player! Awesome!
1,Bissell Pet Eraser Vacuum,"This honestly is the biggest piece of CRAP we have EVER owned for a vacuum!! We have pets in the house so we decided to buy a vacuum cleaner designed for pets. After 1 1/2 months, the vacuum is ALWAYS clogged, the hose will not come off to clear, it dumps dirt on the floor every time we either clean it or dump the container. I can't say enough bad things about this vacuum!! Never in 25 years have we owned a bigger piece of junk.... Do not spend any money buying this vacuum. It's not worth a star on the scale"
2,Not easy to use,"I got this a year ago. This vacuum is kinda heavy and blows out warm/hot air, which isn't fun in the summer. Also, the hose for attachments is extremely short and stiff so it makes it hard to use. The attachment that is used to vacuum furniture stopped working the first time I used it because cat hair got in it. If this is a advertised as a pet vacuum, it should be able to handle some pet hair.It is easy to empty.I wish I stuck with dirt devil."
1,Worst we've ever owned,"This is the worst vacuum we have ever owned. It was advertised as being designed specifically for pet hair, but I am not sure what kind of pet. It sure doesn't work well for our long-haired Shepard. It has not worked well since day one. The filter has to be cleaned constantly and I have to empty the cannister several times every time I use it to get any kind of suction.Besides not picking up dog hair very well, it is extremely awkward to move around the house. It is heavy and bulky. You need some real muscles to use this one.I have owned cheaper smaller vacuums that worked better. As a matter of fact, my Dustbuster stick vacuum has more power than this one.This vacuum is NOT worth the price and I am sorry I chose it."
1,Poor design for handling pet hair,"Bought this vacuum from Best Buy less than a year ago solely because Bissel advertised it as a vacuum for handling pet hair (and we just got a dog). We already had to replace the belt. The brush would have doggy hair wrapped around it and increased tention tore the belt. We were told by Bissel that we'd have to change the belt every three to six months because we have a dog and that it was ""normal wear and tear"" and thus refused to cover the replacement under their 1-year warranty. This diminishes the entire reason of why we bought it! If you need it to clean after your pet, I HIGHLY recommend that you look into a different product!!!"
1,Works fine for 2 months then problems that Bissell won't fix,"The brush jambed up and would not turn. I called Bissell and they called the part a ""Consumable"" and not covered under warranty, I returned the vac."
1,"Disappointing, dirty, and stopped working after a few months!","I have two dogs who shed a lot so I needed a good pet vacuum. After reading positive reviews I decided to get this one. It worked well the first few times I used it, but then it rapidly began to fall apart. It would constantly clog with hair, forcing me to clean the filters more often than I would like. I had a big problem with dirt and hair getting caught in the upper canister, not going into the removable bottom canister. The vacuum gets incredibly filthy and dust swirls around it every time I turn it on. I find that the detachable pieces did NOT do a very good job of removing hair and the suction in the removable hose seemed especially weak.The vacuum has recently stopped working all together... it won't even turn on now. So frustrating. I haven't even had it for a year."
1,This Machine SUX! - Bissell stole my money.,"I bought this machine at Lowe's and it did a decent job the first time it was used. Then the numerous snap-on parts started falling off. The cord is attached to the back of the unit low to the ground meaning that you constantly have to hold on to it otherwise you run it over. The filters always need cleaning and bits of lent and paper it will not pick up. I have had it seven months and all it does is move dirt around on the carpet. Yep, Bissell took me to the cleaners with this purchase. If I gave it to the thrift store I am afraid someone might buy it for five dollars which would be a big rip-off for them. Once bitten twice shy. From now on I am staying away from anything Bissell makes. - kgerton@gmail.com."
2,Awful vacuum!,"This vacuum worked great, at first. But now, I can't WAIT to get rid of it. I have to clean the filter after EVERY room EACH TIME I vacuum, or it loses suction. The emissions are very high; the whole thing is covered in dust, making me wonder if I'm doing any good at all by using the thing. The pop-out canister with pet attachment was a good idea, but there isn't enough suction to make the brush move. I've NEVER been able to use it properly. I really hate this vacuum and can't wait to replace it."
2,Pleased No!,"This Sweeper was ok for the first couple of month's. Then the parts stopped goingtogether and they kept falling off the back. You have to wash the filters ( the black ones) and you have to dig the dust bunnies out from above the canister. I have had it for two years, and now it has lost a lot of suction. My Husband was so upset with me for buying it and so am I. I would never recommend this to anyone."
1,Worst Vacuum ever had,"I bought this vacuum to keep up with the dog hair from two welsh corgis. It has failed on almost every test. Although it has good pick up, the canister is so small you have to empty it all the time. The filter is inside the canister and I have to reach in, pull off dog hair and then remove it to be washed every few weeks. It gets clogged very fast and then pulls the hair up around it so has to be cleaned to make the vacuum work. A very dirty dusty process. When I pull off the tools to use them the hose is so short that the vacuum falls over all the time hitting me or my furniture. This has made me realize that I'm over the bagless vacuum. My next vacuum will have a bag, so I don't have to touch the filth that comes off my floors."
1,Terrible for pet hair,"We got this vacuum because we have 2 dogs. It says it's good for pet hair removal. In that regards it does well but the problem is the vacuum hose clogs VERY EASILY. The container needs to be emptied minimum 3 times in a 900 square foot apartment because it is way too small for the amount it picks up. The dust and stuff it picks up is scattered everywhere when you empty the container. You need to remove and wash all filters between every use or it will clog. It over heats very easily also. I DO NOT recommend this vacuum AT ALL. I wish I could return it, I've only had it 2 months and hate it."
2,Worked great at first,"This vaccuum works really well for the first little while. However as you use it the filters are plugging up and you lose suction proportionately until you have no suction at all. The only way to maintain all that suction is to clean all the filters and canister every few times you use it. If you don't you won't have any suction at all which may explain some of the negative reviews claiming no pick up of dirt. If you enjoy constant cleaning of filters and emptying of the canister, you should love this vaccuum. When it is clean it works great. Mine is one year old and if you want it you can find it on kijiji tomorrow. Two years left on the warranty. I bought a dyson. Yes the dyson has to be cleaned as well but nothing like the Bissell."
1,Worst vacuum ever,"This vacuum is the WORST vacuum ESPECIALLY if you have pets!! Pet hair tangles around the brushes, pet hair gets clogged in the hose, pet hair fills the bagless canister before you can even finish 1 room, pet hair fills the filter,etc. This vacuum is NOT for pet owners. It is SO aggrivating to vacuum because of all the stops you have to make to clean out the clogs!! AAARRGH! Do not waste your money."
5,Awesome product!,I just wanted to drop you a note to thank you for the great service that we received from you .... I appreciate the great customer service and I will definitely use your store again and will recommend you to others.
1,"horrible, had 2 of them","bought two of these from costco. first one lasted 6 months then got clogged, despite constant cleaning, it still clogged. second one lasted a year. thank god costco will allow you to return anything at any time. this is our 2nd unit going back today. worst vacuum ever."
2,Not worth the constant maintenance,"I bought this vacuum three months ago, and already I want a new vacuum. It works fine on wood floors and pretty well on carpet, but the filter has to be cleaned every single time you use it to vacuum more than one room. The ""turbo"" pet hair brush is powered by suction and stops turning after 30-60 seconds of use. The you have to turn the unit off, clean out the hair, and start all over again. We have two short-haired cats, so I can't imagine how useless this vacuum would be if you own long-haird animals. Also, at almost 30 lbs it's difficult to manuver. The canister itself is pretty heavy, so it's still not good for stairs or if you want to clean up a quick spill. Save yourself the aggrevation and buy something else."
1,Don't Buy This Vacuum,"It is awful! It has been just over 1 year that I have had it, but It no longer works. It runs yes, but it doesn't suck anything up. Instead it blows everything on your floor around into this cloud of dust. I have gone onto Bissell's website and apparently enough people have had the same problem for them to have troubleshooting tips for this problem. None of them work, so I had to go out an purchase another vacuum. I decided to purchase the Dyson for pet hair, and so far I love it. I could have saved myself $270 by purchasing it in the first place. I guess we learn from our mistakes!"
1,Ho Ho NO,"Last year's Christmas present and it's been nothing but problems ever since. Ironic that a vacuum marketed specifically for cleaning up pet hair is such a PET HAIR UNFRIENDLY machine. The other reviewers are right - the hair clogs everything within minutes (if not seconds) of use. Even cleaning out the canister before each and every use has not prevented us from losing suction. We've completely dismantled the product and cleaned/replaced parts several times and STILL it breaks down on a regular basis. The little sofa brush has never worked properly, either. Without a doubt, the worst vacuum I've ever owned.Poor design. Going back to Hoover.Thanks for nothing, Santa."
3,"Not bad, but","Just used yesterday for the 1st time. I found it to be quite heavy to push around. I thought it would be better on pet hair pick-up. It's not bad, but with a long haired dog, the frequency of emptying the cannister is annoying. I'm not to sure how often I would have to clean the other filters. It was okay.....suction is good and ease of detaching cannister is fine. I think I should have checked out the weight of the vacuum before I purchsed."
3,Decent with some design flaws,"This vacuum works okay for me- we have hard wood floors so the majority of our cleaning is a couple rugs and then using the stick with floor attachement to do the rest of the house. My main problem with this machine is just the number of filters and places you have to clean. It's a mess to empty the basket, empty and wash the filters and it gets dust (and allergens I suppose) right back all over my laundry room. I guess next time I'll go back to a bagless. My other problem is that the floor attachment (the long horizontal brush) is the only one that doesn't have a place to be stored on the back of the machine and of course, I always misplace that one. It does a decent job but if I had to spend the $ again I would probably pick another."
2,"Great features, but doesn't live up to them...","I bought this about six months ago. When I first used it, I was all excited. It worked great and cleaned the carpets really well. I only have carpets in the bedroom and an area rug in the living room. I have three cats. After about a month, the suction decreased immensely. The hand held rotating brush was awesome in theory, but never worked to clean the sofas well. Just today, the motor burnt out.Pros:1. It was great that the cannister pulled out for cleaning the steps.2. Very easy to switch between hose and floor feature.3. Ability to turn off the rotating brush on the floor was awesome for hardwood floors. It didn't scatter the dirt.Cons:1. After a few weeks (and yes I did clean it) it stopped sucking well. Carpets did not look nearly as clean as first use.2. Motor burned out after just regular use on three bedrooms and an area rug."
2,A mess to empty and broke after second use,"I loved this vacuum for about 10 minutes. Then reality hit. It is a mess to clean out. The dirt cup is way too small, but that doesn't matter because all of the pet hair gets stuck in the area of the canister above the dirt cup, so you have to take the whole thing outside to clean it out each time, because when you remove the cup, dirt falls out of the top. Then you have to use a stick or something to dislodge the dirt at the top. I vacuumed one room the first time, and thought it picked up hair well. On the second use, I did two rooms, and on the second room, the light stopped working, balls of hair and dirt started spitting out the bottom/roller area, and then the vacuum just shut off. The roller kept rolling, but that was all that was happening. It's not clogged, so I don't know what happened. I'm returning it."
3,Just Ok,"The unit works well with getting hair off of the floor and the furnature, but with picking up dirt it leaves a lot to be desired. It seems to just shoot the debris in different directions instead of sucking it up. The filter was useless after just 2 floor cleanings. But it does pick up the pet hair."
1,HATE this vacuum that I spent $$$ on,"This is the worst vacuum I've had in my 20 years as a homemaker. The pet attachment died in the first months. Soon after the brush bar/tube thingy stopped turning. I called Bissell & they said too bad, buy a replacement. That ran me $20 and it's going out again, 4 months later. Worst made machine EVER!"
2,Brush is useless,"My wife and I were not happy with this vacuum. The front rotating brush was not terribly effective, especially on hardwood floors. The suction power, while decent, we found to be lacking even compared to a sub-$100 Hoover vacuum. We ended up returning this unit.We have a Bissel carpet cleaner which we are very happy with, so we don't have anything against the company in particular, just not happy with this one vacuum model."
1,Long-term opinion - problem after problem,"Vaccum worked well for about three months, then loses suction and falls apart. Too many parts clog easily even with constant cleaning. Filthy vaccum. Dust gathers and pours from every crevice when dumping. Overheats after vaccumming one floor. Pet attachment that runs via suction power stops working all the time. Have to completely disassemble and clean vaccum to get working again and then only last for maybe a week. Lock that releases handle broke after 6 months so now bottom flops down every time you pick it up dumping dust all over carpet. Even $180 is an investment for me and I took good care of this vaccum. Not recommended in general - but especially for homes with wall-to-wall carpeting that requires heavy use."
3,"Great, but............","I bought this vacuum to replace one that didn't work well with carpet - this one is fantastic - very mobile, etc. and the amount of ""stuff"" it got out of my carpet was amazing!!! It was like having a 3rd dog there was so much fur. The noise level wasn't bad, eitherWhy isn't it a 5? The extender wand broke the first time I used it. If I could have brought it back I would have (but it was obviously used and I felt like a chump if I would do something like that)"
2,Not Great,"Spent weeks reading vacuum cleaner reviews including Consumer Reports to try and find a good mid-priced vacuum. Used this vacuum for only a few hours before returning it. The height adjustment knob jammed and would not turn. Tried 2 more in stores and they all seem to have bad knobs. I refuse to go through the hassle of getting a machine serviced that I just bought. It did suck a lot of junk out of my carpet but there were a few other cons -- its very heavy, the hose is very short (you can barely reach the top of your sofa)and it seems to run very hot and blows hot air out the back, also the power and brush on/off switches are somewhat inconveniently located. Disappointed and still looking *sigh*."
5,One of the Best,"Despite some of your negative reviews, I find this vacuum convenient, easy to use, practical and thoughly fun to use.I have 3 collies, & 2 cats. Hair is a constant presents and this vac with the seperate hand power tool really does a nice job.The ability to turn the brush off and on from the top really is handy going from hard floors to rugs.The canister is very easy to care for, and the suction remains very strong as long as it is cleaned, especially the hair. And since I have so much hair, I have to dump it daily.Separating the vacuum from the main body allows stairs, upholstry, and automobiles to be done with ease.I've had Hoovers in the past but this particular Bissell really does a wide range of jobs so well.I highly recommend this equipment, especially if you have animals."
1,Broke within the FIRST minute of use!!!,"After looking at/tinkering with multiple vacuum cleaners at the local Target, my wife and I decided on this model due to supposed abilitlies with pet hair as we have two big dogs. However, we started using it on an area rug where our pets typically hang out...and within a minute, the brush stopped working! After troubleshooting it for awhile, we looked to the internet and have read all of these mixed reviews. We are definitely returning it tomorrow."
1,I HATE THIS VACUUM MORE THAN I'VE EVER HATED ANY OBJECT IN MY LIFE!,"As others have said: clogs constantly with no easy way to unclog, makes a filthy mess of itself every time I use it, just junk. Junk, junk, junk. I am about to throw it out and it is functioning ""perfectly"" for what it is. STAY AWAY unless you want a vacuum that requires more cleaning and after-use cleanup than it provides."
1,Horrible Vacuum!,"We bought this vacuum and tried to work with it but always had problems and they just get worse. We had to wrestle and wrestle with the container cup to empty it. The filter was in the way and we couldn't undo the container. When we did after way too much effort and swearing, it was horribly messy. Now after vacuuming one room, the vacuum motor overheats. It's a disaster - we bought it from Target and it's been over 90 days so they won't take it back. Huge waste of money!"
2,Just Say No to this one.........,"I realize that two Himalayan cats and dark colored flat pile rugs would be a challenge for any vacuum, but this one is close to being worthless. I can go over and over and over the same spot and it still doesn't pick up the cat fur, even if it's loose on top of the rug. I advise anyone to look elsewhere for a good vacuum, I just wish I knew where myself."
1,the worst vacuum ever,"ok first of all I would never use anything but a bissell but this vacuum is supposedly designed for pet hair, the turbo brush works occasionally, but has to be taken apart and unclogged after a few minutes of use, I purchased mine on 9/17/2008 and the belt has already broken. This is the worst vacuum I have ever purchased."
4,Q makes his first appearance on Voyager!,"Voyager beams aboard a Q who wants to die. The Q Star Trek fans know well (John De Lancie) also comes aboard and shows interest in Captain Janeway. Q also brings aboard certain figures he claims to have an impact on, including the Riker family. This is a good episode because it has a guest appearance by Jonathan Frakes (Cmdr. Riker from ST:TNG), and the viewers see what the Q Continuum is actually like."
5,Now I can see that,These arm warmers are great to wear so people in cars can see more easily. Too many cyclists being hit these days means there are too many distracted car drivers on the road. Help them out by wearing these flashy bright green arm warmers so they can see you. Black just blends in to the scenery.
5,Great as always,"love reading these books, always fun and interesting. cup of coffee and wome sweets and some sweets and Hamlish makes a good day"
4,Engaging as ever . . .,"I am suffering from Beaton-itis, and this offering won't stop me from reading several more. I'm not sure why. There are more than a few plot contrivances here that defy logic and yet another homophobic characterization. (Please, M.C., aren't there any upstanding gay characters in all of Scotland to balance out the less desirable ones?) Yet I read on. And on. Her gentle humor is like maple syrup on an IHOP pancake. You just can't stop pouring."
1,Blurry images from the first day,"Unusable and Celestron don't support it well, anyway I purchase it many years ago and never used. It seems that the telescope has a fabrication flaw."
4,"Good product , Good quality, Good price",The Sony CDX-M730 has been a bulletproof source of audio for my vehicle going on 2-years now. I can't say I have any major gripes about the unit but the xm antenna cable(not manufactured by sony)is truly frail! I offroad my vehicle almost daily exposing my sony to severe conditions and have not yet had it fail.The one time I did manage to make the cd player skip envolved jumping off the top of a 100'+ slipface at pismo beach (going uphill)and landing after 6' of air. I have yet to find a cd that won't play in it unless SEVERLY scratched. The e.q. features are capable of making the worst recording bearable and the xm radio only once stopped working due to ME being in the Sequoia National Forrest (the tree's blocked the view of the satellite). Overall total price with xm hide-away tuner and antenna was a little high at the time I purchased but has come down a great deal. I say Buy It!!!!!!
2,too much money for what you get,"So if you want to listen to the CD you've picked out with no problems, this is not the stereo for you. I have had this stereo for about a year and am so ready to get rid of it. Yeah, sure it looks cool with the sleek black cover and the flip down face. But this is my problem, the stereo randomly decides not to play the CD I insert. And it's not certain CD's that won't play, it's a different one every time. I have to reinsert about 20 times before the stereo will play my CD, and it happens pretty often. It is soooo aggravating. When I first realized this problem I sent it in and the company sent it back saying that there was nothing wrong. So I basically have to live with it. I definately wouldn't pay this much money for this CD player."
2,Kinda cool - but user interface could've been much better,"This is kind of a good product, but the user interface proved to be too much of a hassle for me to get used to. I stopped using it after awhile..."
3,candy mold,"well, the pic looks alot better than the actual mold, but it was only a few dollars so what the heck, whatever. lol. it will work."
5,Great book - concise and helpful,"This book outlines 76 ways that small businesses often get in trouble with the IRS. A lot of these mistakes are very tempting to make -- in fact, one can argue that it's the tax law that's the problem in many cases, not the business practice. Nonetheless, the author makes clear the IRS position on these mistakes, and shows how damaging the mistakes can be when the IRS wins in tax court over the business owners.Every small business owner should read this book. It's remarkably easy to scan and absorb, though the topics are often quite complex at their root. This book cuts through the complexity and makes clear what the dangers are. As the author writes in the introduction, ""If things go wrong, it gets expensive. For this reason, you should know *where* things go wrong. Because usually they go wrong in the same place. To see your taxes doubled because you made the same mistake that thousands of other people made before you does not make good business sense."""
5,Excellent Text,"Simply an excellent little book, concise and written in a very clear format. Indeed, not making just one of the many mistakes the author comments upon could save your business thousands in taxes, fines and penalties."
4,Good read for business owners,"A friend suggested this book and it was an easy read....very informative and I actually did learn a few things I didn't know. I suggest it for small business owners. A must read for NEW business owners, it's better to know all the ins and outs before making a lot of business tax mistakes."
5,South Park Review by VCroft,"South Park is the best cartoon program that I ever saw it. Is cool because I like so much how Cartman and the oder childrens talks. Is a good way to never get boaring. Is very original, how they said:""Oh no!, somebody kills Kennny"". Att. VCroft"
5,A hilarious hit comedy!,"It made my son laugh untill he cried and went to bed. It made my daughter feel sorry yet also able to laugh at the characters facing there sad life. The movies have lightened me up so much, that there must not be another scetch comedy of cartoons as funny as them on movies and television! I strungly suggest that you should buy this movie not only for your kids, but for the whole family. [including yourself of course!]So what are you waiting for, surf the web for them and when they arrive at your front doorstep, you'll know that the movies the family has ordered will fill your gut with laughter! It can not be descrided by words, how hilarious it can actually get, so go ahead and get the three pack or go slowly and get the one's one at a time, but whatever you and your family do, [of course it's not just for famlies] get all of them at once and watch them over and over again,never ending the laughter and good times!"
1,ungodly,please you film makers and networks dont aim this abomination of a movie tord little one dont see this show or see the movie mys well go get a bag dog poop and stare at it all afternoon
4,realy funny,"the first volume with Cartmen gets an anal probe and volcano is really funny.anal probe is like my favorite episode of south park.volume 2 was okay,and three was kinda bad"
3,Pricing?,"Um, right now it is cheaper to by all 3 DVD's separately than to order this set. So much for buying in bulk..."
5,SWEEEET,"These kids are so cute and funny, you just want to cudle them. They are so sweeeeet. I will just love theme."
1,epson stylus c60,"we use this printer at work and can't wait to replace it. it takes too long just to turn it on (sounds like the print heads are cleaning), is very noisy and lately will not print (flashing red light comes on). we have uninstalled and reinstalled which seems to work for the first print job and then the red light comes back on. and like other reviews, the ink cartridges need to be replaced frequently (we don't print very often). this is the worst printer we have had and will not buy epson again. we have only had this printer for about a year and purchased it new."
1,great program,"I changed my mind after using it recently. It just is too cumbersome, and worse, it gives error messages w/o solutions, and crashes repeatedly. I really would like a good acrostics program but this one is too limited and replete with bugs. Sorry, but it really needs some work."
2,The puzzles are hard to create,"I've tried to create my own puzzles but the steps are too many and too confusing. This must really be for professionals. The first steps are easy. But after writing the quote and the author and title and pressing okay, I'm lost. In the help section there are many instructions, but none are step by step or frame by frame which would make it easier to follow. Also,all of the icons don't appear. They sent me a second cd because of glitches in the first one. But, I'm not faring any better with this one. I won't send it back because the game edition on this one plays better than the one I previously bought. I wish they would come up with another game edition, with new puzzles. But, I don't think I'll ever get the hang of making my own. Almost a waste of money, but the response and service from the company is tops. However seeing the difficulty with the Enigmacross, I would think twice about the Crossdown Maker, especially considering its price unless you are a professional."
4,A Fun Lesson In History,"I thought this book was really good. It was interesting to hear how kids my age had to live and learn in that time. Great material for a book report, and you get an extra fun lesson in history."
1,The first book to divert this STORY back into the history,"Xu Zigeng of mainland China deserves a lot of discredit for leading the effort to concoct this STORY, years before it broke into the mainstream American press. This is the English translation of his book, which won national awards in China."
1,Be careful,Since when have you started believing the communists propagandas from mainland China? Iris Chang? You got be a little more realistic.
5,Captain Janeway kicks [rear end]!,"When Captain Janeway and Neelix return from an away mission they find that the ship and entire crew have been taken over by some new alien life form. The aliens make quick work of Neelix (thank goodness,) so Janeway is the lone crew member remaining to fight to get the ship back. Along with the holographic doctor the captain fights for her ship and crew. If you are a Kate Mulgrew fan, you'll love this episode, since about 90% of it is her alone. It's sort of Kathryn Janeway meets Sarah from Terminator 2."
3,"If you can get past it's glaring unoriginality, it's OK.","""Macrocosm"" was very interesting to me until I realized one thing about halfway through the episode: It's a blatant ripoff of a Next Generation episode in which the crew of the Enterprise-D begins to de-evolve, and the Captain arrives with phaser in hand to save the day. Here, instead of de-evolving, the crew is subjugated by a macroscopic virus that flies around the ship biting people like it was an insect. The CGI effects are well done, and the story is interesting, if you can get past the fact that once again Braga and Berman have ripped off something better, though this time, it's another Star Trek episode! If you ask me, I'd rather own the Next Generation episode, but if you're intent on buying Voyager, then you could do worse than ""Macrocosm"""
2,No Plot!!,"The intro to this book suggested an interesting coming of age type book set in the late fifties. However, after slogging through over two hundred pages, I could continue no more. The book simply has no plot. Tollie's pregnancy seems like an aside, for which I could not develop sympathy for. Likewise when a character dies. You simply do not come to care for these people. I had to put the book down without finishing."
4,"Excelent, but...","It's very good, it's the best cd player I've had, but the custom sound programming is a little difficult to understand. I've had mine 2 days, and I read, and read the manual, but I can't program it ok.Also it needs a little more volume, and it's a little fragile. But It's still excellent."
2,Very Fragile,While this seems like a great MP3-CD player don't drop it. I dropped mine about 14 inches unto a carpeted floor and it's never worked since!!!
2,Not that great...,"I got this cd player a week ago and it's not all that it's cracked up to be. I suppose if I DIDN'T have a Mac, I could take advantage of the mp3 player. The features are cool, but I absolutely hate the sound. There no bass boost on it, so it sounds flat. And I have good headphones! So, I can't say that I would recommend this cd player."
5,Great player,"This player is easy to use, has great sound and a terrific set of features. Battery life is unbelievable, when playing MP3's.The only negative is Sony's proprietary ATRAC format. The software is a dog, conversion is extremely slow, and it's essentially pointless if you already have software to rip MP3's."
2,"Fine sound, unusual controls","This CD player is as small as it is physically possible, its diameter just a little larger than the CD itself. The volume controls are tiny, other controls are not obvious by looking at them, and in general, unless you had the manual with you, you wouldn't know which controls do what. Very poor engineering, but the sound itself is not bad at all."
4,Good deal.,"Works great and plays MP3 CD's that a more expensive MP3 CD player wouldn't play. Seems to go through rechargeable batteries pretty quickly, though."
1,broke down after 2 months,This player has stopped working after 2 months of light use even though I have taken perfectly good care of it. I don't recommend buying it.
5,Corrected my problem,"My riding mower engine would occasionally stop or refuse to run under load, especially when hot. It could be restarted after cooling off. The spark was difficult to check accurately but appeared weak at these times. Installing this coil corrected the problem."
5,"Easy to install, works as advertised.","Needed to replace this as part of fixing my riding mower. Instructions that came with it were clear, and it worked like a champ."
2,Sony has lost my business....,"Have always bought Sony components....never had a problem. Though after reading reviews here, decided to look into my changers. Never had a problem with skippping or reloading in the wrong slots and have had two changers loaded and in the same flat location for over five years. Started pulling out random discs, some of which are out of print and hard to find, and to my horror.....EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WAS SCRATCHED IN THE SAME SPOT!!!! So much for trust in Sony.....am unloading both players now and trying the worst of the scratched discs in other players....hoping they aren't ruined.....unbelievable."
2,Great product - just does not last long,"I bought the Sony CX355 300 CD jukebox a little over 2 years ago from amazon. It looked like a great item and the price was right, along with the free shipping. I loaded about 90 CD's in it and it was great, everything worked fine and I had all 3 programs input & running fine. However, out of the blue, a few days ago, it started skipping bad, and would not play any programs, etc. Until then, it was perfect. So, I guess I am luckier than others here as I got 2 years out of mine, however, I would have thought it would have lasted longer. After reading all the reviews and horror stories about trying to get repairs, etc, I am just going to throw mine at the county dump. Luckily, I kept my old CD player, a 6 changer Onkyo that has worked fine for almost 10 years, and will start using this again. No more Sony products for me."
1,bought two and both are defected,"I can't belief that a cd player from such a reputable company as SONY can give somuch trouble. I bought one a year ago and two days after the warranty expired the cd stop playing. Seems that the motor mechanism was weak and it would cost as much as a new one, so i bought a new one instead from J& R thru Amazon and right out the box, it would play a cd and upon starting the second cd it would stop playing the cd at 1 second or 2 second and i would hear a clicking sound in the player. I try and see if i can' t get back my money from J&R and go for a diferent brand."
1,CD Destroyer,"At first we were delighted with this Sony CD player, but it was not long before we determined that it was destroying our CD collection. Fortunately, we read a review on Amazon from another customer that lost many of his CD's to the same Sony unit. Over 20 of our CD's were damaged before we pinpointed the problem to the changer and replaced it with a Pioneer 200 disc changer (which we've had only two weeks but so far it appears OK). I am disappointed that Sony continues to market this defective equipment and as a result, we generally try to shop for other brands. If you value your CD collection, a Sony CD changer is likely to disappoint you."
3,"If you love your cds, you might be advised to stay away","Generally,it's a good multiple player will tons of features.The sound is good,etc.BUT, on two occasions it has malfunctioned - it does not replace the cd back in the tray correctly and you have cdsbumping and banging against each other. Very stressful indeed! I cannot trust it anymore. I'm sending it off for service after 8 months of use."
2,"some thing work, some things done work","I is just alwright. nothing to write home about that. I would look for a better one, if I could."
4,Great! and shipped superfast.,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She loaded up all of her cd's, connected it to her stereo system and that's all there was to it. Lot's of features to explore. The only con, is it's so deep. The cabinet she put it in has doors. Removing the doors was not an option and the only way to make it fit was to cut out the back of the cabinet so it could slide through. If you have a lot of disks this player saves a lot of load and unload time."
3,Remote Doesn't Work,The remote control function does not work. I have changed out the batteries and read the manual but it will not respond. I don't know if the problem is the remote or the unit. I have not contacted anyone about this yet but I need to get it corrected because we placed it on a high shelf and we can not reach it without a ladder. Other than the remote control not working everything else works fine.
1,Table error,"I loved mine, and it worked great. Used it maybe twice a month, Bought mine on Sept 28. 2002, and when I was playing it this Thanksgiving, it broke down, first it starting making a loud noise, then it would not play, Then in the window it wrote Table Error, but now it is all but worthless, unless I decide to have it repaired, which most likely will cost as much as the unit.I love Sony and never had a problem with one of their products, now all Sony cares about is that I did not buy the extended Warranty. Which we all know is not worth the money."
1,Do not waste your money on this Cd changer,"I purchased this CD Changer and then returned it after a few weeks. The CD Changer would routinely skip the first track of every CD I played. It would skip no matter how new or old the CDs were. Cleaning the CD's did not help, nor did using a CD head cleaner. There are numerous reports of this issue on the web.Save your money."
3,changer jam,The changer jammed on me once after first trying the machine. This was resolved by turning the changer off/on. I haven't had an opportunity to use it since.
5,Very good deal for this player.,"Having owned and used extensively the earlier version of this player, the new one seems quite a good follow up to the original. Being able to obtain it at a discount was a nice bonus."
1,Skipping problems becoming unbearable.,"I purchased this unit in early November 2011 to replace my 8 year old JVC 200 cd changer. I loaded our Christmas cd colection of about 85 cds. Problems in the first 15 minutes. The unit has a problem with getting stuck or skipping about every 10 songs. At first I thought it had to be bad or old cds. I cleaned them or replaced them. Problems persisted. I tried all the tricks. mables in a cup, heavy weights on top of the unit. No real fixes.I usually have the player on random mode. Sometimes it will get ""confused"" and take 15 minutes to find the next song.The remote has about an 6-8 foot range which was surprising as my old JVC remote had a good 20 foot range or more. ugh.On the plus side, there is not much. It was easy to set up and use.I will suffer through the holidays with it and then move into the MP3 age early next year.Shame on Sony. I should have listened to the reviews that I read here warning me about this product."
5,Excellent Value,This 300 disc CD changer works great. Easy to use and sounds great. And the price is right.
1,DISGUSTED,"well, i thought it was only me, this unit has given me trouble since day one as well,and after having owned the 200 cd model for several years which played on 'shuffle' virtually 24 hrs days at a time without ANY problems, i simply needed more capacity. As noted by other reviewers, this thing just gets worse.......in lieu of going through the hassle of paying to ship it to sony and get a reconditioned unit, i was almost going to purchase another new player, and just chalk it up to experience....NOT AFTER READING ALL THR OTHER REVIEWS THAT INDICATE THAT THIS IS NOTHING BUT A LEMON THAT SONY IS STILL MARKETING........after buying many sony products over the years, i will be reluctantly shopping for another brand of player, and while there is no feature more necessary than sony's delete bank to eliminate unwanted songs from playback,it wont be a sony............"
2,Don't buy used,"For the dollars I saved purchasing new, I have to say I am disappointed. The sound is the final word. The cd player itself is in need of repair. Often have skips on tracks and the sound at times is muffled or tinty sounding. NOt sure what it will cost to get the actual player repaired or replaced, but I'm guessing if I would have bought new, I wouldn't be facing this issue."
1,Defective product,I opened this product and loaded about 50 cd disks. The rotating carriage stopped working---grinding sound--like gears slipping and tried numerous times to turn on and off to resolve the problem......had to unscrew and remove the cover to retrieve my disks and send the product back.Decided to not deal with another potential defective cd player and bought a 160 gig ipod and will rip the disks and join the 21st century of music storage. CD's are so out of date.
5,excelent,Second one we have owned first one went defective after 12 years. does the job well Sony is our preferredmanufacturer.
4,its very nice,"I own 2 of these, one for my home theater, and one for my one the road pa use (its mounted into a case) i never had any trouble whats so ever, except it likes to be random once in a while IE it will decide to play random discs and tracks or the change disk function wont work... oh well"
3,I dare not buy any more CD players,"I dare not to buy any more CD players until the engineers can finally come up with a produce that will work without chewing up my CDs or skipping a lot and just not functioning. I have owned a lot of CD players and they are all the same. Maybe if we can get it designed and manufactured in the USA we can buy one that really works. I am a Product Design Engineer and I have never seen such consistent non-working CD players in all of my life and career. At age 70 I am completely fed up with crap CD players. Not just Sony, but EVERYONE! You would think they could have fixed it by now. In order to play the CDs, I have to play them on my computer. I have a MAC with an internal drive that works but I can't seem to get much audio volume out of it. I also have the ""Lightscribe"" and my CDs work fine in it. So maybe vibration is a big part of why CD players don't work."
1,"Never buy it, if you are not electronic expert","I had cdp-cx 220 since 4 years.No problem at all.But this one can not read the CD's and making best afford to break my CD's.Worst this is not happened all the time and impossible to repair.I don't trust Sony anymore.But finally I remove the cove and remove all related loading mechanism,I found a problem.It was a switch which is not working.After I replace the switch no problem at all.But I believe that This product never been in quality control."
3,Good Sony Disposable Unit,"This is my 3rd Sony 300 CD Changer. The first one lasted 4 years, the second one lasted 2 years, and now I just set up my 3rd one. We use this for whole house stereo and sound is fine. The problem is the skipping everyone else has reported. To me, it is worth the $7 month it will cost me when this one goes out in 2 years. I looked at other models but reports indicated poor sound quality...so I stuck with this disposable Sony."
2,Unreliable.,"I've had two of them. First one died exactly 365 days after purchase. Still played, just tried to load from every empty slot as well as the full ones, so it spent much of its time cycling rather than playing.Second one lasted longer, but now simply loads disk after disk and won't play any of them.My experience with microprocessor-based Sony gear is that sooner or later, their brains get scrambled, like the highend Sony cd player in my car, which is junk after only 18 months.I think I've bought my last Sony equipment, and would not recommend this unit.Other objections, even when it worked: long cycle time, noisy operation, size, clumsy interface.Good luck."
4,this is my first cd changer,"i'm digging not touching the discs anymore, so far i loaded about 70 discs by category mood order, started with mellow music and ended with harder stuff. i'm enjoying the shuffle disc thing, it's about a 10 or 20 second wait, no problem, it changes a disc faster than i can. if i find a track i like on shuffle, i switch it easily to one disc shuffle or regular play which makes the wait between songs much faster, very easy also to line up the next disc with the right dial. i hope day 2thru364 is equally pleasurable, i am a dj i am what i playi purchased this model on clearance without a remote, it's good to leave some things alone in a corner. all pleasure, no effort.my advice is buy this or the 400 changer which also plays mp3 and dvd. this model is just fine by me, because the mp3 discs though convenient without an automatic changer, sound inferior to the cd master version. 320k is close but no cigar, the 400 changer probably also supports SACD"
1,Poor Quality,This CD player has never worked well. The laser unit malfunctions all of the time. The unit regularly cannot read the first several tracks of a disc. Stay away from this one. Look for other options.
2,Multiple CD Player - Sony,"I have had this CD changer for many years. Except for a few minor irritants at the beginning I have been satisfied with it. But a few days ago it died! When I say died I mean in the grave, absence of vital signs, Nada, zip, nothing, crapped out, zero, down the S$%*&er! I am not going to replace irt with same device. I'll try something different."
1,Biggest piece of junk imaginable,We've had our player for about a year and it has made the trip to the service center in Laredo 3 times and we've had enough. It hunts for discs endlessly and can never change discs for more than a few times before it screws up and does the carousel dance. Laredo 'adjusted' it a couple of times and on the third trip 'couldn't find anything wrong'. When we got it back after the last trip it was just as bad as before. It's going in the trash and our house will now be a Sony-free zone forever.
1,Arrived physically broken,"I was very excited about this player, although a little dubious given the large number of reviews indicating technical difficulties with this unit.My unit looked normal and accepted a CD when I plugged it in, but immediately gave me a loading error. I had to open up the case to get my CD out of it. Turned out the entire spindle apparatus that spins the CD was broken off, flopping around in the back of the machine. Very unhappy with this purchase."
4,"How I Fixed the ""Table Error""","What worked for me was taking the cover off and carefully threading a belt back onto a wheel. There are two motors at the back of the unit, one (I believe) that grabs the discs and moves them in & out of the player, and a second one that rotates the table (i.e., the round slotted thing that holds all the discs). The belt had simply slipped off the wheel that drives the latter. I did remove the back panel as well, to access it better, and inadvertently disconnected a sensor plug, which led to a second round of troubleshooting, but - in the end - I got it working!Oh, and I've had this item for over eight years now, and, though it's a little buggy at times, it does do the job of keeping hundreds of CDs organized and ready to play. It's a nifty fifty-pound iPod!"
1,Sony 300 CD changer,Used this machine for about three weeks until it stopped working. It seemed the trouble was trying to load two discs into the reader. Sent back to Sony for a replacement. Still waiting for a reply. This is the second changer I've had. The first one lasted thirteen years until the belts wore out from old age. The second one was a refurbished machine.
4,Working good for my intended use so far,So far it has met my expectations and works great for my use of it. I would recommend this unit for anyone that has many cd's and want hours or music at their fingertips.
1,Junk!,This was the most useless piece of junk I have purchased in a long while. When it was brand new it would not play the first song on about one third of my CDs. I spent something to the tune of $40 to ship it back to Sony for repair. Once returned it was better (it would play about 9 out of 10 CDs properly but still was not right. Now (about 1 year later) it plays the beginning of the first song on each CD several times before it continues to play the entire song. I give up. I bought an iPod and am currently loading all my music into it. Once I get the Sony player empty I shall be taking the sludge hammer to it....
4,nice,all features performed ok. It takes a lot of time to enter digital titles for each CD. Maybe one day CDs will contain a digital title that can be read by these machines.I especially liked the manual controls for replaying a song .The remote works well too
1,Do not buy this item!,"After reading the other reviews, I though that things wouldn't go wrong for me, but I was wrong. The CD changer began placing two disks in the same slot the first week that I had it. After that happened, the CD scrapes across the inside of the changer as the carousel turns, scratching the CD. Do yourself a favor and just stay away."
3,It does have a work around,"I purchased a Sony CDPCX355 300 disc changer and, like other reviewers, spent time organizing and loading my discs. Right from the get go it started skipping songs, skipping discs, and refusing to play. I was unable to get a refund and figured I would ultimately have a fairly nice boat anchor when I needed a new one. Before I unloaded it I decided to leave the unit powered up with the door open. The heat would keep the unit dry as I thought moisture might be causing the problems. Well, it has played perfectly ever since and has not skipped on a single CD. Now I am not happy about having to leave the unit turned on with the door open but if I wanted to get any use out of it, that's what I had to do. I have had it for 2 years and it is working fine. Worked for me, hope it helps you. Oh yeah, otherwise it is a nice piece of equipment."
1,Poor Quality Product,"Great features and concept, but a lousy product. From day one, it has skipped on CDs that play without problem on any other CD player. I'd clean the offending CD and eventually have to burn a replacement CD to correct the problem. Now, about 10 months later, I'm having to junk the CX355 altogether. It skips or simply can't read just about every CD - even brand new ones. This thing didn't even last a year! I've read similar reviews on this player, the Sony 400 CD player and the Pioneer 301 CD player. Frustrating that by 2006 there still doesn't seem to be a reliable 300/400 CD player available to consumers."
4,Very happy - with a minor hitch,"Wish I could give 4 1/2 stars. I own 2 [connected together], and just bought a third to give to my daughter.IMHO, this is a remarkable changer for the money, especially at Amazon's price with free shipping into the bargain [that's a deal-closer for me on this big item]. I have had the first one for about 4 years, and have yet to have a skip, much less a devoured CD. But mine has always been nicely level and in a good cabinet, on a firm, non-bouncing floor.The minor hitch? As other reviewers have stated, a more-generous titling disply would be great, especially to sort through all those Beethoven titles. But being able to use a keyboard for entry eases that a bit.I'm quite happy with mine."
1,Wonderful while it worked,"Bought this player and invested a lot of time organizing my CD's, typing titles into the player, etc. It was great and it made listening to CD's much easier as they were already in the player. Then, out of the blue it won't play about half of my CD's, they skip and jump and stick. None of the CD's had come out of the changer since I put them in, and they all played fine at first, so the condition of the CD's have not changed. I tried playing CD's that won't play in the CX355 in my other CD players and don't have any problems. Too bad, it's such a great concept, but not worth the time to set it all up when it doesn't last."
1,Money down the drain,"The CD changer worked fine for a while, then I started having some of the problems mentioned here, and the problems seem to be getting worse. After that delay, it begins playing the CD, but some CDs it doesn't like after a song or two. It then skips to the next CD and won't even recognize the skipped CD if I try to play it again. I have to open the door and close it again for the player to acknowledge the skipped CD is in the slot.I was unable to find any suggestions on the Sony site, so I thought I simply had a defective machine (or that I'd somehow damaged it in a recent move). I'm grateful to know that I'm not alone and that I have some potential remedies. Still, for the money I spent, the machine ought to work."
4,300 CD,Unless you find yourself running out of space on your current player you'll have a hard time filling this one up. Works and sounds great with my equipment.
1,product flaw,This is the 2nd one of these we purchased in the last 18 months. This one began to skip after 2 weeks. The first one worked for over a year
4,"Works perfect, for 2+ years now.","I've had absolutely no problems mechanically with this unit. It is loaded with over 200 CDs now and had survived power outages, daily multi-hour use, and is in ""random"" at least 3/4 of the time, requiring it to switch CDs every song. Maybe this one was made on a Thursday, right after lunch, when everybody in the factory was in a good mood. I keep my original (purchased) CDs in this, and make copies for my vehicles. I do kinda worry, after seeing all the lousy reviews by others. One fault is the lack of much of a labelling system. Just a dozen or so letters for each CD, not nearly enough. I did find one Dylan CD that labelled itself, and all the songs! I wish the other CDs did that."
2,No internet connection? No thanks.,"Why is there no internet connection on this? You have to sit there with a keyboard and enter all the information disc by disc, or put up with DISC001, DISC002 on the display. Maybe they can move into the 90s and make this go out to the internet and get disc information. Only redeeming quality is you can put your entire collection in these things and just let them play endlessly."
1,Bad unit Bad service,I purchased this unit new when I was setting up a new home entertainment and stereo system. I like two channel stereo more than surround sound. I found that the system was not producing much bass through the two channel portion. I thought it was the amplifier. I upgraded to a great Dennon AVC 2112 but still had the same disappointing lack of bass. I had major health issues and didn't have the time or energy to work on my system. Now that I am better I again tackled this problem and picked up another two channel stereo amplifier and discovered that the problem is the Sony CDP CX355. I called Sony and they said they'd swap it out for a remanufactured unit for the same price as a new one. No way. I'll buy somebody else's unit and never do business with Sony again.
3,Sony 300 disc changer,Only complaint I have would be sometimes it takes well over one minute to play next song. Otherwise great product.
3,Remote not functioning.,Re: CDP-CX355. I've had this unit for about 3 weeks. I picked up the remote today and NOTHING happened! Replaced the batteries several times. Sometimes it will function if I position the remote very close to the unit.
1,Great...for a while,"Like most people, I've slowly converted most of my music collection over to FLAC and 320 mp3. So, this CD player didn't get much action over the last few years, which should add to its lifespan, right? Wrong. It just plain died. I had to take it apart to retrieve my 300 discs and then it went into the trash. Ironically enough, I pulled an old Kenwood 5-disc changer out of the box it had been in for at least 6 years and it works like a charm. Go figure."
2,Believe the other reviews,I read the other reviews and decided to try it anyway. The reviews are correct. The Changer fails to forward to the next CD. The changer skips the first few bars of a song or reepeats them like a stuck record and every now and then it just won't play at all. I tried to return it but it was past the 14 days and the vendor said no. Very intermittent piece of equipment. Not much better than 8-tracks.
5,sony cdpcx355 300 disc changer,"hi i have got two of these machines and have had them over 6 years and have not had one problem at all, so i cant say a bad thing about these machines."
5,Sony CDPCX355 300 Discs Mega Storage & Disc Player,This is an excellent piece of equipment if you prefer the use of CD's instead of MP3 players. It is great for music fans who collect discs.It facilitates storage and safekeeping of CD's. You may choose to enjoy music by selecting particular disc(s) or random playing. You do not need to have a full sound system to enjoy this piece of equipment and your records. Simply plug speakers directly (for example Bose's computer speakers). It sounds amazing! I have used Sony mega disc players for over 10 years.
2,Nice..... I Thought,"The 355, 300 disc unit. My first one lasted three years, lasted up to a few days before the extended warrantee expired. It kept hunting for a disc endlessly and would not play. The unit was replaced with a new one and the replacement lasted just over one year ending with the same problem, just beyond factory warrantee. I advise against the 355 unit. The company I bought it from stated the model had some problems.2 Stars was because it had nice features, looked nice, easy to set up, had a delete file of the tracks I don't like, and played well when it worked. Unreliable, but maybe Good if you get a 5 year extended policy and plan to take it in."
1,I hate this hunk of junk!,"Having a collection of 400+ CD's, my husband bought me this unit for my birthday. Aside from the complexity and many hours of placing and programing the many CD's, I was excited about this thoughtful gift. It didn't take long before I really came to hate this dreaded machine as it kept skipping CD's and sometimes refused to play them, and much to my horror breaking one of them. My husband called the large and popular electronic chain store where he purchased it, but they said we had to contact Sony. Sony's 'customer service' was useless and said we had to send it to them (at our cost of $75.00 S&H). Weeks past and I received a replacement...a used CD player which has to be my original CD player's twin, as it does the same thing. Refusing to pay another $75.00 for S&H, I've tolerated this miserable machine. Since the manufactures warranty has run out, we will try to get this fixed or replaced with the extended warranty. I'll keep my fingers crossed that 3 times is a charm!"
1,SONY=NO CUSTOMER SERVICE ON WARRANTY REPAIR,"AFTER 5 MONTHS OF USE,CD CHANGER JAMS AND BREAKS YOUR CDS. SONY HAS A CONSUMER SCAM AGREEMENT WITH UPS STORES THAT OFFERS""DISCOUNT"" SHIPPING AND PACKING OF THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.UNFORTUNATELY,THERE IS NO DISCOUNT AND THE PLAYER COSTS CUSTOMER=$60-$37 TO SHIP W/ DISCOUNT???. EVEN WORST AFTER PAYING THE SHIPPING OF WARRANTY COVERED ITEM YOU FIND OUT SONY +UPS STORE SUPPLIES WRONG ADDRESS!!! CD PLAYER LOST, NO ONE AT SONY OR UPS STORE CAN EXPLAIN ERROR OR ASSIST IN GETTING ITEM TO CORRECT LOCATION TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.LOST TIME,$$$ AND HAVE NO CD PLAYER. BUY PANASONIC PLEASE!!!!!"
2,CD player is ok,Had this CD play for just over a month and it started working out great had no problems. but then after about a month it started skipping on almost every CD and track. even brand new CD's I just put in. Then I had a rough time at getting J & R music to give me a return auth to send it back. not sure if I'll ever buy this player again or anything from J & R Music.
5,Sony MegaStorage,"We are loving the CD storage/changer!!! Since we're not ""IPod people"", this is a perfect solution for us. We never listened to our CD's - it was always too much trouble to look through them, etc. Now, they are all neatly stored and just a click away from enjoying them."
5,Every bit as Good as Expected,This is a beautiful machine that was amazingly fast and is everything it was billed to be. Thanks a bunch!!!
5,Sony 300 CD Player,Wonderful CD player. Easy ability to organized CDs by 8 different groups. THen direct play or shuffle play by group or entire lot. Would recommend product for others.
3,OK,Beware product doesn't come with disc file booklet for 300 disc's. I had a hard time finding a Disc File Booket and ending up buying two CD booklets for a total of 55 dollars ( 200ea x 2booklets = 400 Dics Flie Booklets).For no additional cost JVC 200 CD Exchanger offers a 200 disc file booklet with there product.
1,Sony failed,Great facade within lousy performance! Skips from disk 1. Sony can do better. Do Not buy this product - waste of money!!!
2,Dies After 3 Years,"Bought the unit in 2002. Nothing difficult about using it or interfacing it with an amp. I was extremely happy with it and my main bitch has always been the way the player abruptly begins playback on any given CD. It skips 1/2 to 1 second of the first track of any CD but other than that, I was OK with it. It never chewed up any CDs and played burned discs just fine. Recently it began skipping. Upon further investigation I determined the price to exchange it for a refurb would be apx $133.00 plus s&h; plus tax. Right. Like I couldn't add thirty bucks to it and buy a *new* model s&h; free from this site.Since I'm in the market for a new juke and since I've read the reviews here regarding chewing up CDs I'll be purchasing another player not manufactured by Sony since the possibility exists the next CDP-CX355 I purchase may ruin my collection."
1,Count the good vs. bad reviews. Don't Buy This!!!,"I bought this unit so that I could Finally put all 300 of my CDs (Pre-recorded and self-burned) into it, hit the random key and enjoy music for hours at my get togethers. NO SUCH LUCK! You almost have to baby-sit this machine half the time it's on. My Burned CDs are in excellent shape and they start out as sony blanks. Don't mean nothin'. I'm stuck with this hunk of junk. My wife needs another changer for her new business. We will be trying PIONEER this time. Reviews seem allot better."
1,Inferior Product,"I bought this new and less than a year later, with about maybe 20 times turning it on or using the CD (combined), and with it being stationary in one spot -- the sound went out -- no static, music, not even a buzz. All the lights and buttons seem to work fine, but I'd stay away from this. It sure LOOKS cool though."
4,simple story but appeals to my toddler,This is a simple story but somehow appeals to my toddler. He has been making me read it every night for the past 2 weeks...I admit I am tired of it but he's not. The pictures are nice and detailed. My son especially loves the ending and laughs at it everytime we read this book. I think this book is perfect for toddlers and preschoolers who are into Thomas.
1,WRONG BLURB - DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is advertised as being the quick release stock for Encore rifles. It is not. It is for Muzzleloaders NOT rifles and does not contain the quick release system, rather it contains the MUZZLELOADING oversized screws. I got took to the cleaners and I suppose I can use it for kindling wood...DO NOT BUY THIS unless you have a muzzleloader...."
3,B'Elanna and the robots,"I enjoyed this episode of Voyager, but if I have one criticism, it is that I would have liked for the writers to have used this episode to better aquaint us with the character of B'Elanna Torres. Unfortunately however, I didn't learn anything new about Torres through this episode - it was just ""more of the same"". Torres is smart. Torres is competent. Torres is stubborn. Torres has a temper. Okay...I get it! Now let's get below the surface!The best thing about this episode, in my opinion, is that it provides a ""textbook case"" of why the Prime Directive is so necessary. Torres learns this the hard way in ""Prototype"". Turns out, Janeway is much wiser than Torres originally thought!"
1,Sort of Bicentenial Man meets Voyager,"If you've ever seen this episode, you know what I mean.This episode starts out from the point of view of Automated Personnel Unit 3947, a damaged robot found by the Voyager crew floating in space.Torres makes it her personal crusade to save the robots ""life."" Once reactivated, 3947 kidnaps Torres and takes her to its ship and threatens to destroy Voyager if she doesn't build a prototype so its people can ""reproduce."" After successfully doing so, she realizes the real reason the robots were made incapable of reproducing, and ends up destroying her creation.At the end Torres and Janeway have a rather sappy discussion of how good Torres felt creating a new life, and how sad she was at having to destroy it.There are much better episodes to spend your 14 bucks on."
1,A Better Read Second Time Around,"The artwork intriguing, however the text-Not! A compilation of Verbose Language and Wordy Images left little to be desired. Not recommended. While Powell offers some beautiful phrases they are in little consistency with the entire Poem."
1,You deceived me,The lamp is extremelly little. It looked bigger in the picture. It is out of proportion. I am appalled.
5,Don't miss any books by this author!,"Another winner for Gene Florence. Wouldn't be without his books. Beautiful, color pictures on nearly every page. I have read this book and all of his others over and over again."
4,Good Book,"I found this a very helpful book. It had clear pictures and a lot of information about each piece. Even though it included a great number of pieces, there is plenty of room for another edition, and I hope the author includes only items NOT listed in the first book. I have other collector books where the second edition is mostly a repeat of the first edition, with only a smattering of new items added."
4,Good reference for beginning collector of Fire King,"This is my first purchase of reference material for my new hobby of depression-glass collecting. I found the pictures to be exellent, and the price guides informative, although a bit awkward to use at times. His comparisons of similar items are helpful, and the book is worth purchase for the pictures alone. Hope to compare it with the Kilgo book someday."
3,Good reference,"This book is an excellent reference but with some flaws. A pricing chart on one page references several pages. I prefer to have the pricing on the same page as what I am looking at - personal preference.I especially like the section at the back of the book that compares two like objects and states which is which (i.e., cereal bowl versus chili bowl).All in all - I'm glad I bought it even though I already have one reference book on Fire King."
2,Great Pictures; Information NOT well researched,"Quality photograpy. Has the look a of a ""thrown"" together book.Much of the historical information is not clear or is inaccurate. Needed much better editing.Many items shown but not priced; some items not even shown or mentioned based only on the limited research of the author. Author needs to do MUCH better research if there is to be a volume 2. Buy only for the pics!!"
3,"Informational, yet poorly organized and hard to follow",I learned so much from this book and all of the great pictures. But when it came to looking from the pictures to the price list there was much inconsistency. Some pages row 1 was the top of the page and some row 1 was the bottom of the page. Some things were pictured yet not priced. The coffee mug page is a mess!!! The pictures and the price list are like trying to figure out a puzzle. Mr. Florence please get a better editor for your next book! This makes me hesitent to buy another of his books.
4,Fireking,"Shipment received later earlier than expected, nice packaging, would recommend product to the avid collector of vintage fire king dish ware"
2,Incomplete,This did a good job of giving you pictures of patterns and dates of when they were produced. Would have liked more history about the company and when the stamped company name on the bottoms changed. As well as to have items pictured by name. Internet is a better source for that information.
4,So-so.,"Okay. Good price. Don't find book terribly helpful. Prices of glassware outdated. Book itself, though, is in great shape."
3,"Not much ""and more""",This book is fine if you are interested in fire King. If you want other Anchor Hocking products don't waste your money.
2,It does not have all the levels,"This game does not have all of the original Donkey Kong arcade game levels. I don't think it is too much to ask to expect all of the levels from the 80's vintage 8-bit arcade game.As it stands, you just start repeating the same levels over and over again . . . and that gets boring quick. Had I known it was an incomplete adaptation, I would not have bought it."
4,Got Pie....?!!!,"With this new classic of Donkey Kong on GameBoy Advance I can only say one thing to my favorite video game of all-time... SHAMEFUL!! You can create all the fancy modern day crap that's out now for G.B.A. but you can't put in the infamous ""Pie Factory"" to a simple classic video game that I was hooked on for many years in the early 80's? What were you people thinking? I guess you weren't at the time! I'm still hoping they come out with the original Donkey Kong (Pie factory and all) on CD-ROM to put in my computer. Is someone just being greedy and not wanting to share this great classic game on any other source? I know I'm not the only one who feels this way! As popular as this classic is you would think it had been on CD-ROM a long time ago. Nintendo, if you're smart enough, you'll recall this disaster and re-create it the correct way. What a let-down!!"
4,NES Donkey Kong on the go,"Many people seem to mistake this for the arcade version even given the fact that it's part of the ""Classic NES Series"" of Game Boy Advance ports to celebrate 20 years of the NES.So here's the NES version of Donkey Kong, ported to the Game Boy Advance, unedited and unharmed in any way.However, you might overlook this since Super Mario Bros and Zelda are also ported to the GBA."
4,Good ol' classic fun!,"I always loved Donkey Kong as a kid, and this just revived my love! The only down side is that it's missing two more levels than the arcade version, just like the NES one. It's still a great game and provides hours of fun trying to beat your high score! Definitely worth the price."
3,Why No Donkey Kong Classics For GBA?,"As much fun as this game was on the NES and now on the GBA (though compared to the original arcade version it still lacks the ""pie factory/conveyor belt"" screen), one could only wonder why this game couldn't have been sold as Donkey Kong Classics for the GBA, giving GBA owners the added fun of playing Donkey Kong Junior (a great arcade game that lost little in being translated for the NES) without messing around with eReader cards. It would have been worth the $20 paid for this game alone."
4,Donkey Kong,"I loved this game as a kid, that is why I got it. Things aren't always what we remember but overall I do like it. I agree... even w/ the missing level it is fun. It is a game people... let's not harp over it. Good game to go back to and be a kid again!"
1,"If you want to play NES games, use an NES.","This game is not bad. The E-reader version was much more affordable, though.20 dollars? For 3 one-screen levels? I didn't think so.If you still want this game, get the old black-and-white game Donkey Kong for the original Game Boy. It has all the levels from this, plus about 100 more. Fun."
3,BORING....,"I played this on the NES. It really wasn't good I played it in arcades. It still wasn't good. Thing is, I won't pay 20 dollars for a 3 level game that isn't that fun to me anyway. I gave it 3 stars only because it is an oringinal Shigeru Miyamoto classic. I'd pay 20 dollars for The Lengend of Zelda, but not Dokey Kong."
5,Classic Reborn,"I just barely heard about this game 5 minutes ago. I admit I don't have the game and I haven't tried it. But I have the old version of this game from years ago for the Game Boy original system. I've had that game for about 7 or 8 years and I'm still hooked. I'm extremely excited that they remade it. The price is ridiculous though. It's an awesome game (puzzle and action at same time), but it's not worth $20. $10 would be a more reasonable price unless the game pak included more than one game. All in all I'd buy this game in a few months or ASAP when the price goes down."
1,DONKEY KONG MINUS ONE,"The one star I gave this product is a negative one because this game is missing one level --- the ""pie factory"" level. And let's face it, making it to each new level until finally reaching the final pie level was exciting. But for whatever reason Nintendo has left the final level out of the game making this yet another incomplete console version of the arcade classic. You would think Nintendo, the company the originally made the arcade Donkey Kong, could create a faithful replica of the arcade classic for it's own console platforms, but I guess not. Nintendo needs to get its act together."
3,Too Short,"This is a good game, but it only has 3 levels that are easy. There are very few enemies, and mario is very slow and can't jump high. I wouldn't recommend you waste your money on this, because it gets boring really fast."
1,A game of 3 levels,"Donkey Kong is an arcade classic great and a milestone in gaming historyBut I do not understand why Nintendo did not release a Compilation of it's many early arcade games... or a compilation of it's early NES classicsInstead, Nintendo releases single games in individual seperate carts at unreasonably high pricesAn Arcade Compilitation of Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, Donkey Kong III and Mario Bros would of been much more apreciated than a singular NES version of Donkey Kong wich isn't even an arcade Perfect versionVideo Games consumers should not buy this game or any of the individual Classic NES series when Nintendo could of crammed all of those Classics into 2 or 3 carts insteadfor shame on you Nintendo!"
4,Was good value for moneys,"The price for this bike seems to have gone up since I purchased it for $119 a few months ago.* The seat was comfortable, shifting worked fine.* Geometry didn't feel right for me, it didn't feel like a sit upright bike and it wasn't low enough to ride it with some power.* Suspensions are nice, after a while I found myself not caring too much about bumps and ended up going over a bit of under-construction concrete at high speed and bent the rim.* Tires seemed to get a puncture every few days, or maybe it was just the places where I rode it."
2,Very uncomfortable seat.,"For a comfort bike, this is not at all comfortable. The seat is hard and not well shaped. Also the gear shift does not work as advertised. Spend another $200 at a bicycle shop and get a real comfort bike."
3,A good bike for the money,I bought this bike because I read about it in consumer reports. They ranked it fairly high and it was priced right. I was expecting a little more but it is not bad. The shifting could be smoother
4,Mongoose Placid Men's Comfort Bike,Quite happy with this mountain bike. It's fairly light-weight and has a comfortable ride. Would have preferred to have quick-release hubs but that would have surely increased the purchase price. All around good value for the money. Item arrived even sooner then Amazon estimated. Another positive experience with Amazon.com.
5,"Marty Party ""Favors""",One great song and superlative performance after another. This is still my favorite from Marty. Party on my man !!
4,This is a good episode,"I had reservations about buying this episode because of the bad review on this page, but I'm glad I bought the episode. The story centers on a holodeck character that Harry falls in love with. Knowing how silly that is, but deeply infatuated, he asks Tuvok to help him purge his emotions. Tuvok then meets with the holodeck character and finds she's not like anyone he's ever met before.A good Tuvok episode. I highly recommend this one."
1,A horrible display of ego,"This episode is incredebly boring! The plot is stupid, and the special effects are extremly corny. Don't waste your money on this!"
1,Save your time and money,"If you want to know the preoccupations and concerns of late 20th Century theologians, this book is an excellent resource. If, on the other hand, you are not interested in how many times the word ""community"" can be used (over 400 times in the book), or you have a healthy skepticism regarding the self-assured conclusions of the historical-critical method run amok, or you actually want to know what the Early Church thought about the Eucharist ... buy another book. Buy a Bible and a copy of the Catechism. Go rent a movie. Just don't spend your time or money on this."
2,Half of the book is blank reserved for notes!,"Pages 38 to 97 -- half the book -- is just blank space for notes, which you could just as well write in a 10-cent, 70-page notebook spiral. The beginning of the book is mostly made up of pages with simple checklists and address forms, with some bulletted questions here and there."
4,Good resource,"I used this notebook to teach elementary students in grades three through five how to organize themselves as reporters for our school newspaper. It lends itself to easy application for a variety of audiences. As a teacher, it brought reminded me of content students need. It has been an asset to our elementary journalism class."
2,Unnecessary expense for student journalists,"This notebook is not a very useful tool for student journalists, and it's way too expensive. The same effect would be to give all your students $.79 spiral-bound notebooks after teaching them the basics of journalistic writing."
2,Picture does not show detail,"Since you are unable to really zoom in on this picture and there is no picture without the flowers in the vases, it is difficult to see the detail of the vases. They are not evenly shaped and there are bubbles in the glass. One vase has more bubbles and several of them are large bubbles and they really do not look well made. I wish I wouldn't have ordered them but I'm not going to pay for return shipping. The seller needs to post better pictures so you can see what you are really getting."
5,MAY BE MY FAVORITE BELLAMY CD!,"I am a huge Bellamy Brothers fan! and the LOST TRACKS CD is divine !what a fine! Thank you so much for making this cd! There are several tracks on this cd that I had actually NEVER HEARD..what a treat. I do have the Bellamys first LP ..and I am so glad this cd contained a song from it that I love, ""Satin Sheets.""...If you are a Bellamy fan, don't miss this cd!!! They are one of a kind..and this cd shows such a beautiful variety of their vast talent!"
3,One of my first CD's,"This is one of the first cd's I ever gotten... I still have it to this day... scratched to def! But my favorite songs were Curiousity, Problems, and Gin and Juice.... I loved that Gin and Juice song!"
3,OK compilation,"This CD is pretty mediocre, and there isn't anything really distinguishable from the many rap/hip-hop movie soundtracks out there right now. There is nothing groundbreaking here, and no surprises from newcomers. The overplayed hit Gangsta's Paradise by Coolio kicks off the CD. It's followed by a lot of songs from unknown artists (Most of which should have stayed unknown) that sound like every other track on this CD. The two standouts are the Rappin' 4 Tay tracks A Message For Your Mind and Problems. Both of these songs are really good. As for the rest ... they are easily skipable. Don't waste your money on this CD."
3,Not what I expected,My own fault for not reading size. Smaller and not what I expected especially for the cost! My own mistake will make it do.
4,"Such a cute bunny, but a loose tail","I first saw this toy at the airport in Minnesota. I was delighted to find him on Amazon and my husband ordered him for my birthday. Right away I was taken in by the cute handmade construction. I did notice however, that the stitching on his pink pom tail was already loose and was concerned about giving this gift to a youngster. Other than that-wonderful toy!"
3,Stripes the bunny,"This bunny is very cute (not nearly as bright in color as the picture) but doesn't seem very durable. When I got it already had a loose thread that I had to retie and if my son were to pull on the eyes at all they would come undone. I also thought this bunny would have been a little bigger, but like the other reviewer said it is easy to throw into a diaper bag."
3,Not for everyday use,"The bunny is very adorable, but it isn't meant to be lovey and taken everywhere because it just isn't durable enough. My daughter loves bunnies and this is not one of her favorites, but many adults comment on how cute the rabbit is."
4,I should have read the product details!,"I should have read the product details, and I typically do! I'm sure this will be well received, but it's not really a ""huggable"" plush/teddy/what-have-you. This item would probably be great if used for room decor. Product details are dead on--had I read them, but for those like me who read reviews every time but may miss prod details, this is a very small item."
3,Cute but small,"I was really excited when I bought the toy. I thought about purchasing a sock money, but that this one was so much cuter. The thing is it is small, about half the size of a sock monkey. I think I paid too much for it."
5,Son LOVES stripes and takes him everywhere,"The colors are bright, even after multiple washings. We have had one 18mths and a leg and arm have come off, but were easily sewn back on. Given that my son takes this everywhere, and gives it some very hard loving (read chews and shakes him in excitement) I don't think this is too bad. The washing may have weakened the stitching too. The eye and nose are perfect still.We have several of these because my son relies on him to sleep and to soothe him so we are not scared if we lose or leave one somewhere! We love it and constantly get compliments on it whenever we go out with him."
3,Not what i was hoping for :/,Its cute and everything and i got it really fast. But the head of the bunny is tiny compared to the rest of the body; more like 3 or 4 times too small :/ i hope my friend will like it....
4,Colorful and great for a desk or shelf.,"This is not a toy but a decoration, collectible, or shelf animal. Cute and colorful. Floppy ears are fun. Made well enough."
4,Cute an colourful!,"I bought Stripes the long earred bunny for no other purpose than to collect him as a character based in a book. The book was written by Marcia Willett - The Christmas Angel. I'm not sure how Stripes would stand up to the rough an tumble of a 2 year old . This Stripes wont be!!!! A toy for a newborn plus maybe? But he is adorable. I think if you read the reviews and you love him still, you wont regret buying him. I didnt!"
3,Nice printer but...,"I'm somewhat please with the Epson C60. The print quality is very good. You can use a wide variety of paper types and the effect will still be the same, GREAT.However, the C60 is a real ink guzzler. The printer has its own ink monitor and when you first put in the cartridge (black or color), the monitor says it's full. When you print a one page document, the monitor has the ink level at 3/4 full. What is that????The Epson C60 is a reasonably priced printer but with the numberof cartridges you are going to have to buy, in the long run it's very expensive."
2,Ink monger,"This printer will, sooner or later, chew through your wallet in ink catridges. When functioning normally, it seems to use ink at a faster rate than any printer I've had, including other epson printers. And the ink for this printer is not cheap. As another user pointed out, even compatible catridges are pricey, much more than say, Canon ink.Most alarming is the printer's incessant need for nozzle cleaning. It seems the slightest jarring of the printer will cause the nozzles to become clogged, requiring 2, maybe 3 consecutive nozzles cleans, which EAT UP INK very quickly. No other printer I've ever owned has had this problem.And of course, it takes forever to warm up and is loud. Bottom line: if you want to shell out outrageous amounts of money for replacement ink catridges, suffer long nights of frustrating nozzle maintence, and tiresome printer warmups, buy this printer."
3,C60 Prints beautifully but .....,"I was disappointed in this printer. It makes outstanding color copies. However the cartridges are very expensive. Each one contains a microchip, I think to measure the ink suppy. Because of the microchip there are no generic cartridges available. The cartridges supplied with the printer are designed to initiate the printing process and appear to contain very little ink. If you plan on buying this printer, plan on buying extra cartridges right away. Three cartridges (color or black) will cost you about the same as the printer."
3,Speedy but Expensive in the long run.,"To be honest i'm not very happy with this printer, not because it's performance and speed, it is because the cost in the long run.Acoording to PCMAG this machine is one of the fastest printers in the market today, (if you buy it and put your first sheet of paper and press the print button you will know what I mean) the paper is almost spit out of this little machine. But at 10 cents per page the ink investment per year (About US$250) is too much. If I have another chance to buy a printer again I will buy the Epson C80 or the Canon S500 witout a doubt.BestChristian"
2,Bad choice for high volume of printing,"A good printer if your printing needs are light but a bad choice if you do a large volume of printing. Only had printer for a year and already parts need replacing. Just to have someone look at it to tell me what needs replacing is going to cost $65. Mind you, I only paid $99 for it. It also uses up ink too fast. I have to buy 2-3 cartridges a month and they are expensive, $30 per cartridge.Finally decided to go with laser. Will never buy another inkjet printer again."
2,Waste of money,"While the printer itself may be relatively cheap, you'll spend so much money on ink that in the long run you'd be better off getting a good laser printer. It seems to run out of ink after only 15-20 pages."
1,don't buy this one,"This is the worst printer that I have ever used. The cartridges are too expensive and have to be exchanged far too often -- the customer service people recommended that I use the printer every day to keep the nozzle and print heads ""fresh"". They told me that if I was going on vacation to have someone come in and run off a sheet of print every few days! Now I've come home from the store only to find that in the week it took me to get a new cartridge, that the nozzle is clogged and my colour cartridge is too empty to perform a cleaning. Don't buy this one. I'm switching back to Canon -- better performance, cheaper ink."
2,Can't pring just B&W if you have no Color Cartridge in it.,"I found the Epson C60 to be an average to poor quality printer, having owned it for about two years now. I don't print much at all, so I didn't want to spend alot on a printer. My impression is that there are now much better printers on the market for less.The thing about it that annoyed me to no end, was the fact that once it's run out of color ink in the color cartridge, even though it has plety of ink in the black and white cartridge, it won't print simple black and white printouts, even though I told the driver to just print in black and white. The only reason I can see for this, is for Epson to sell another ink cartridge."
1,Worst Printer - Do Not Buy It!!,"I purchased this printer and since the day I received it has not worked perfectly. It printed lines through everything I printed. I waited until I replaced the ink cartridges to call Epson. Once I knew the problem was not the ink, I called Epson and they sent me a replacement printer. The second printer performed the same way with white lines in photos and text that I printed. After talking with another Epson customer representative who promised the printer does not perform that way, they sent me a third replacement printer. The third printer I admit was better, however, the quality of the print outs are still very poor. I'm going out this weekend to purchase a new one and it won't be an Epson!"
4,Canon c60... great bargain,"This is the 2nd C60 I'm buying... this time as a present. Great color photos on glossy paper and inexpensive to operate. Good value / rated very highly as a best buy by Consumers Reports. Good speed. I also have an Epson C80 which is much quieter, faster, and a little more expensive. The C80 is amazing with matte finish photo paper... it has a 4 ink cartridge system vs 2 ink cartridges in the C60. Both units are refurb units. The truth about refurbs: they can be better than new because they are retested in the factory by more qualified technicians.Very happy with both the C60 and C80."
1,Don't buy it!,"The product is so so and the technical service is even worse. First, I need to wait for a long long long time (at least 45 mins) to have a chance to talk to a tech person. Then, after an hour long talking and trying (very similar to the trouble shooting part in the menu), he told me that ""I cannot help you! You need to find some outside help!"" What was that? Don't waste your money!"
1,Disgraceful piece of hardware,Unfortunately we have 2 of these in the family - don't ask how. They've both been rubbish from the beginning. They refuse to print black if the colour cartridge has run out and vice versa. The colour cartridge is approximately 30 and runs out very quickly. The chips prevent them from printing even when they haven't run out - resetting them with a chip resetter proves this. They're extremely noisy and seem to go through a ridiculous clunky procedure before even getting round to printing. So turning on the pc to print out a quick document is a joke. Finally ours doesn't work at all now. I've have not seen a more disgusting piece of equipment in 16 years of computer use! I'm writing to Epson to complain - contact me with your thoughts - chris@remotemonkey.com
1,Ugh!! Don't even think about it!!,"Hi. I own one of these wastes of space. I was given it as a gift and it is the worst thing I have ever owned. I have to run the head cleaner and nozle cleaner at least once or twice ever couple of weeks. This is something that you sould only have to do every few months, not nearly this often. Plus the printer ink is very expensive. Please get a cannon or hp. At least those printers work well for a longer period of time!"
2,Inexpensive for a reason,"hey, it's an [inexpensive] printer and you get what you pay for. I had mine for about 6 months and it always had a problem printing more than 4 or 5 pages at a time, it would somehow get jammed or confused and would have to be reset in order to continue the printing. also I had to replace the ink cartridge twice and I don't do that much printing. the quality of the print is good in both color and black and white, the cartridges just didn't seem to last that long. I wound up trading it in for an hp laser jet."
3,Noisiest Printer,"I have had 5 printers in 9 years Canon and Lexmark and always thought Lexmarks were the loudest. Wrong. This Epson is by far the winner. The price is reasonable and the photo quality above average,not great. So as long as you don't work in the late night and wake up your family it is a good printer for the price."
1,not as advertised,"this used printer prints but the ink replacement funtion does not work at all. Advertised as ""works very well"" it does not."
1,An exercise in frustration and disappointment,"I have worked many different kinds, makes, and models of printers in my life, but I have never worked with one so impossible to load with paper as this one! The paper tray doesn't seem complex, but it constantly rejects sheets and feeds them through again and again. It can take 10 to 15 attempts to print one page of a document.Additionally the color on our fourth print was very uneven and streaky, particularly if we tried to do any blocks of solid color (small, large, it doesn't matter). We bought one for the office a week ago and already everyone has called it a piece of junk."
1,[Stinks Stinks Stinks],"Let the price or other reviews not fool you. This printer fails in the basic functions it is designed for. The paper gets jammed so often that we are forced to manually feed one paper at a time and GOD help you if the printer decided to reject the paper, you go back to the start line and start all over again..It is going where"
5,Great Resource,"This book is a wonderful resource for childcare centers and schools. We used it as a guide to develop a new holiday policy in our program. The author discusses the importance in recognizing and celebrating culture and tradition in all families, as well as outline why. She also discusses how children respond to holidays developmentally.I highly recommend it to any center or school that is looking to revise or develop a holiday policy."
3,Large Print Roget's Thesaurus,Not all of the words of the English Language were covered.As a writer I was looking for more detail. Sorry I am usually very pleased with your stock.
3,A little disappointed,"I'm not sure if I overlooked the description of this book, or the description was lacking, but I thought this was going to be a paperback. I was taken aback at the size and weight of this book.It's contents are acceptible but I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Review on Large Print Thesaurus,"This was a gift, and although the person really liked the book and is what he wanted, I was a little disappointed that the hard cover on the book was bent."
2,Not organized alphabetically,"I gave this book to charity. It was organized in categories, which I hate, instead of alphabetically which allows one quicker and easier answers."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Most of the words I have looked up, were't even in there. This was definitely a waste of money. I have a very old Roget's Thesaurus, and I find myself still using it, even though I have to use a large magnifying glass. I had hoped to leave my magnifying glass behind, but I had to dust it off."
5,Large Print Thesaurus,I purchased this product for my student who is visually impaired. It arrived quickly and was inexpensive. My student loves it!!
1,This ring is small and looks like a cracker jack toy surprise!!,When my daughter opened this on Christmas she looked so sad. It does not look like the picture. That has been magnified so much. You can not see the filigree it's so small.It took along time to get.
4,Good quality and thick but my printer may have problems,"This paper costed a bit more than what I wanted, but it seems to be of good quality, thickness, and brightness. Once in a while, my printer takes more than one sheet of the paper, and it's frustrating when this happens, but this may be a problem with the printer."
2,Not Good Enough for Brochures,"This is just average paper. I gave it two stars because my kids will be able to use it for school. I had hoped to use it for brochures for my business but this paper is lightweight, see through, and not smooth.Boise Premier Print paper is far superior (heavy, opaque, and smooth) and what I will be buying next time. The Epson paper has the same specs as Boise Premier Print, but is far inferior.Note: I'm not impressed with this Epson paper, but my Epson 4540 printer is amazing.12/8/2012 Update: I paid 8.99 for this paper, but the price is now 4.99. That is a more appropriate price for this paper."
2,Costly and not so great.,"I bought 3 reams to use with an Epson Artisan 810 and perhaps with an older HP Pro Deskjet. While these papers worked fine (not great) with the Epson all-in-one, but the print quality was horrible on the HP. Texts are fuzzy and overall print quality is not as sharp and vibrant as claimed. I thought maybe a head cleaning would solve the problem but that wasn't the case. I tried some older HP non-premium bright whites and the results are far more superior with much clearer vibrant colors and sharper texts. I've also tested some really old Georgia-Pacific Legal (8.5"" x 14"") standard inkjet papers with the old HP and the text quality also improved compared to the Epson bright whites, and the results also looked better printed with the Epson Artisan printer so this further proofs that these Epson Bright Whites are nothing but overpriced hype. Luckily I got them on sale at a very good price but I will be going back to using HP inkjet papers instead."
2,Not the best for 2-sided copying,"The overall quality and brightness of the paper is fine. However, I purchased this paper mainly to use for 2-sided printing/copying based on the reviews stating that you could not see through it. Unfortunately, I CAN see through to the writing on the other side. Thus, I cannot use this paper for the booklets and other documents that I need to print.If you are looking to print professional documents on both sides this is not the paper for that. Look for something with a minimum weight of 28 pounds."
2,Not very satisfied for the price,"This paper arrived in a box that was torn at the edges (a complaint noted by another customer as well). The paper was not damaged, though. The paper is bright and a nice thickness, as expected, but several sheets of paper in the ream had small dark spots on them due to imperfections in the paper fibers. It was noticeable enough that I had to reprint several resumes. I will never buy this paper again. Even Staples branded paper is more consistent in quality, at a little more than half price when on sale."
2,"Nice paper, too pricey","There's no reason to order this paper when you can get comparable paper delivered from Staples or Office Depot at a fraction of the price. Also, after making the switch to that generic paper, I've experienced fewer jams on my inkjet printer."
3,Bright White Paper ?,"Product S041586 purported to have ""Brightness 108"".When the package was opened there was no assertion/confirmation of that ""brightness!"" Totally non-commital as to its brightness. There was a notation ""Formerly Premium Bright White Paper,"" but that does not tell me anything.The paper is white, but NOT sparkling ""108"" bright.Too bad . . ."
2,Bad texture,"The texture feels kind of rough, not smooth at all.Feels a bit too a bit too thick.The printout doesn't look good on this paper."
3,Epson paper,"This paper is fine for printing;however, if making calendars like I was, the print and pictures tend to show through."
4,Great Product 4 The Price!,"I do a lot of printing in relation to a small business that I run so I'm constantly looking for great deals on good quality printing paper. I do trust the Epson name so when I ran across this offer, I ordered it without any hesitation. So far, so pleased! The paper is bright (great for color printing) and sturdy enough to be used as label/art. Very absorbent and dries quickly! I will be ordering again = my only ""con"" was there is a small wrinkle at the top corner of one pacakge of paper (all pages). Not bad enough to cause any problem and was probably cause by poor (mailing) packaging."
5,JBVideos,"The Epson bright white paper is the best paper I have found , It is great for double sided printing , It is the brightest white paper out there , You can buy staples paper for less money but you get what you pay for .."
4,Just right for standard inkjet output,"I typically use Boise X9 Bright 20lb paper in both my laser and inkjet printers. This Epson product is ever so slightly heavier. I barely notice it, but for two sided printing, the 24lb paper is an improvement as you don't see the print as easily on the other side of the page. I also notice that it is somewhat brighter in shade and smoother, allowing for the inkjet to do a better job with fine print. For regular black type, the laser still outperforms the appearance of even the best inkjets, but since so much of our work has color these days, it's nice to find an inexpensive solution for at least the paper side of the equation. This is a step up from basic copy paper, but it's not such a step up that anyone will say, ""Oooo...nice paper.""Watch for a good price, as the price varies from $5 to $10 for 500 sheets."
2,Jams Ink jet Printers,"The Epson Premium Bright paper is a nice, bright white paper; however, it's just to thick for most ink jet printers and causes horrible paper jams. I actually returned a Brother All in one ink jet printer, because it would jam on every sheet. My new HP J6450 also jammed on this paper. I'd go with a lighter weight paper, otherwise you maybe pulling pieces of it from inside your printer."
3,Did not come with instructions!,"Not only did this not come with instructions, but I didn't realize it was a DIY project. I thought it would have letters and ink and stuff on it already.No spell-check, grammar is sketchy, and I'm unsure the content created couldn't be better acquired in digital format."
3,3 stars,"amazon prime is great an delivered on time thats why i rated it 3 stars.. after i opened the box witch was packed ok i noticed the Epson paper box that was tore an ripped at both ends very bad, paper was ok but should have been noted as a damaged item.. if not for the amazon prime i would have returned it.. again , shop amazon prime its worth it.."
3,Too thick for many printers.,More than a few times multiple pages were pulled in together. Thinner paper works better in our printers - Canon and HP's.
5,This paper *is* 108 ISO brightness rated,"A 1-star review complains about the paper not being 108 brightness, but the poster is confusing scales: this, like all modern papers, are measured using the ISO (International Standards Organization) method, more specifically ISO 2470:1999 or 2470-2:2008 (Paper and board-Measurement of diffuse blue reflectance factor (ISO Brightness).The 1-star reviewer was comparing this to paper that was measured using a different scale, probably one of the two regional TAPPI scales (sometimes called GE brightness) if he is in North America; his/her review should be deleted as it's incorrect."
1,Not As Advertised,"The Amazon image of this paper indicates it is 108 brightness. When I received the paper, the Epson boxes had no brightness number on them at all. When I compared the paper brightness to some 104 that I had, I found that this paper is probably closer to a 97. I will certainly not buy it again and Amazon should remove the image from their site that shows it to be 108 brightness."
4,"""I heard their thoughts, saw through their eyes."" --Chakotay","Why is it that every time Chakotay gets screen time, he's falling in love with a blonde alien? Still, this is a fun episode to watch, and it presents some really interesting food for thought. Who is right, Janeway or Riley? Both their perspectives are presented so that the answer isn't completely black and white. The Cooperative are portrayed sensibly as neither villains nor heroes, striving for harmony, never harming Chakotay, but resorting to mind control to get what they want. And as always when given a chance, Robert Beltran is reasonably convincing as his character finds himself unsure of what the ""right thing"" is. Chakotay inter- and re-acts--both with his captain and on the planet with the ex-drones--almost like a person instead of Starfleet cardboard. Overall, this is an excellent hour of Star Trek that includes all the classic elements: characters, tension, ethical dilemmas, and of course, the Borg."
2,"Compared to professional tripods, this is not","The work professional in the headline is misplaced. Compared to a professional tripod this is wobbly. I can't even press the shoot button on my a77 without noticing the legs move. I have a DX700 for my spotting scope, should have just bought another one. I bought this because it had the crank vertical head but really don't know if it will be usable. Anyhow the a77 has a 2 sec timer so I guess I'll just use that."
5,Lasted 7 years,"I purchased this tripod in early 2004 (it's now Nov. 2011) to use for holding my spotting scope while out birding. After 7 years, I've finally decided to upgrade to another brand. Generally speaking, it was a decent tripod. However, don't get the leg clamps wet without drying them off...they will rust! It was usually stable, although it wasn't heavy enough to withstand strong winds when I had the center column all the way up. After ~5 1/2 years the clamps cracked (presumably from repeated exposure to cold, wet conditions) and the legs started to slide when they were ""locked."" All in all, it was a good tripod for a long time!"
2,Not very good. Do not buy.,"I made the stupid mistake and went by the product reviews on Amazon, eventually settling on this product. I bought it from a local retailer and felt buyer's remorse right after I took it out of the box.It's pretty cheap looking. The legs are not round in their construction - they are fragile and somewhat bendy. I couldn't feel the quality of higher end tripods like Manfrotto ones, even though that was implied. The design of the tripod is really strange and looks like something out of the 80's. You can't really tell that by looking at the picture. In person it's just awkward. Leg tensions will pretty much guarantee that you'll injure your finger at some point.Today I returned it and got a much better one - Slik Pro 400DX. It's just a 10 dollar difference but the construction and the quality trump this baby tripod. It has a nice weight to it (just right), and the legs are cushioned. I love the 400DX.Learn from my mistake and don't buy it because of the glowing reviews."
2,Don't like it,"I'm sure for a photographer with a still camera, this tripod is fine but I bought this for a camcorder and quickly found out I should have spent the money on a better tripod.The quick release head doesn't work very well with my camcorder and twice I've had to catch my camera from falling off the tripod.So basically the lesson is, don't be cheap when buying a tripod for a videocamera."
3,"Sturdy and solid, but be careful","This tripod works well, and I've had good success with it. The thing is sturdy enough to hold my Canon 40D and 70-200 lens, and I really have no issues with overall performance.That said, I do have a problem with the quick-release feature. It works great and all...but the little mounting nub that screws into the threaded part of the camera (or lens mount) tends to come loose rather easily. Just be aware of the thing, and that it can fall off at any time. When it does fall off, the tripod will be useless. So my advice is to buy a couple of extra nubsSLIK 618-752 Replacement Quick Shoe for Tripod U-212DXto have on hand for when (not if!) you lose one."
5,Best bang for the buck!,"I've had this tripod for about 10 yrs now and can't see myself ever giving it up! It's one of the most versatile tripods I've ever used. I've used it for video, 35mm and now digital photography and it's always been a champ.The only downside I've seen to it is the quick release locking mechanism. As you turn the lever to lock it, it draws the quick release mount down into the head. You have to be careful not to use a camera with plastic threads or metal threads mounted in plastic, as the locking mechanism can either strip the threads of the camera or pull the threaded grommet through the plastic. I personally feel that this is more of a camera issue and not a SLIK design flaw. Otherwise it holds the camera securely to the head.I highly recommend this tripod to anyone looking for a sturdy yet lighter weight tripod."
5,Great episode,"I'am a huge star trek fan. Have all the series,this was a great episode of voyager.Have the Doctor faliing in love,a new ermotionhe has never experienced. Simply great."
5,This is what I'm talking aboot!,"I love midgets, and reading aboot buildings designed for midgets is the greatest thing."
3,Extremely basic,"I purchased this item for use at my library, but it is so small that it is unsuitable for most of the building's keys. It wouldn't hold standard door size keys comfortably. If you have a lot of filing cabinets or small keys to organize, it's an affordable option. The tags are cheap and difficult to label, however. The ones I received were multi-colored, and had small paper tags inside that were hard to remove and replace, and so small that they were difficult to write on. The plastic case is a decent quality, but wouldn't protect anything if someone really wanted to get at the keys. This item is best where organization is more necessary than security."
2,Taffy ...,"It has been something I had looked for so long but arrived dry and flavorless ... disappointing quality, was really hoping to have a positive experience."
2,Somewhat Diappointed,"I used to get this at the 7-11 for five cents each so it brought back memories from my childhood. When I was little, it came in all flavors.This package was the same product and as good as I remembered, but it waslike a multi row of flavors for each bar. When I was little, each bar was a seperate flavor"
5,elegant simplicity,"This little piece of machinery is simply beatiful in the perfect elegance of its functionality. If you need to set up your VTA to get the most life and sound quality out of your cartridge and stylus, GET THIS! It works! It's cheap! What more could you ask for?"
4,A simple device,"A nice little device for the ""near"" perfectionist who wants to do things right(like setting the tracking force on a quality Shure M-97 cartridge). It seems a bit overpriced for a little teeter-totter, but it works well."
3,Works as advertised.,"Seems to be quite accurate and is fairly easy to use, except getting the stylus into the slot instead of either side of it takes a good eye and a steady hand."
1,This product is NOT gluten free.,"Before buying this, I made sure to check ingredients, but it was difficult to find the info on the amazon site. I did finally find it and it did NOT list any gluten ingredient. Unfortunately when I arrived, it clearly says barley malt. Now I'm stuck with 8 boxes of these that my family cannot eat and we can't return because we opened a box before we realized it. Guess we will give them out to friends. This is very disappointing as we normally love amazon products."
2,Too Sweet/Sticky,These are a little over the top. With Chex Mix you kind of want the sweet and salty balancing. These have so much coating that they are very hard and sort of sticky when you chew them. I felt like I had residue all over my teeth. Wound up giving them to a less discriminating sweet tooth in my life.
5,chex food,my daughter loves the chex food and she take it with her to work as a snack and eats it all the time I like the way it fits in her bag
5,"Chex 100 Calorie Snack Mix, Chocolate Carmet","I am in love with this snack. I agree with the others, it is way too difficult to find in the stores. I was looking for something else on amazon.com and did not realize that they had groceries. I too am on Weight Watchers and it only counts as 2 points on the point system. GREAT TASTE and LOW CALORIES...CAN'T BEAT THAT COMBO! Thanks Amazon."
4,Great tutorial for college physics class,"This program is an excellent tutorial to go along with the book by the same author. There are many hints to help solve evey problem in the book. Someone spent alot of time making this program, it's very simple to use and all info is accessed from the start screen. The only problem I see is that this program does not have the complete solutions like advertised, and it's not the instructors edition."
3,SPAX Screws,"O.K. product with narrow shaft near the head which prevents wood splitting.However, unlike the picture the thread does not extend all the way to the head but stops short by around 3/4"", thus reducing hold capacity."
3,I Made This Book Work,"This 680 page paperback is a lot faster to read than one would expect. It has a lot of screen shots and therefore not as much reading as the number of pages would suggest. I got it when Office 2000 was new and I had some downtime away from computers but thought I'd see what was new in the 2000 suite.I read this book over the course of about 3 days, going through it here and there. After that, I never had a reason or desire to open it again. It's not a reference book by my estimation. It's a ""get acquainted"" with software type book. That's really what it's for, but the Visually series had by this time started to move away from the concept that made them great."
3,Weight is not for stars.,"How many visuals does it take to make a book useful? This book seems too fat for what it offers, namely some great tips that would have served me just fine in a much smaller book. I feel like I wasted my money because this didn't help me to learn, and I doubt it can serve as a reference. I think Master Microsoft Office 2000 VISUALLY is a case of too much being too little."
1,Terrible beyond belief,"I cannot believe how bad this movie is. It makes no sense. It is contieved beyond belief. I sat there for over an hour and a half waiting for something to happen. Nothing.After I finished watching it, I had to Google ""The Heat of the Day"" to read summaries in order to find out if somehow I missed something. I didn't miss anything. It is what it is.If this is a product of Elizabeth Bowen, I will NEVER read anything she has ever written. As a writer, she brings need meaning to the word pretentious."
4,Look What I Did,"Although it doesn't have every Joe Walsh song on it that I would like, it's a pretty complete collection of Joe's work. If you want alot of good music in one package, it's well worth the money."
3,Essential? To a point!,"I can only say that Joe Walsh and his career has absolutely made their way and Joe paid his dues and erned any great moniker you want to give him. Joe is certainly worthy of rock superstar status.However, and much like any compilation of one artist, you will always find a few album cuts or some favorite songs missing that makes fans and consumers unattracted to the set. But in this case it was pure blashemy to exclude ""The Confessor"". We are talking one of THE essential Walsh tracks. It was like taking ""Hotel California"" out of an Eagle greatest hit collection.Love Joe Walsh and love this collection but note ""The Confessor"" is essential and it may make this collection incomplete.Otherwise this would have been a solid 4 star rating, packed with Joe's best moments pre and post Eagles. And with this you will gain a better understanding as to why Joe Walsh could very well be not one of the best guitarists in rock, but certainly one of the better ones."
2,Sound clips,"Not only is this not the collection I would have made,but when ripping on my puter,it clips and stalls.Maybe I just got a bad copy."
1,Joe Walsh! Not The James Gang or Barnstorm.,"Not to include ""The Confessor"" was about as big a rip off as I can imagine. If you include the first two groups you are with, why not the third? EAGLES!! Joe Walsh you made a big mistake with this one."
2,"Nice Features, Poor Reliability","I bought this lens for my Canon Rebel 2000 because it has a really nice zoom range (28-135mm), some ""macro"" capabilities (only goes to 1:2) and seem to be rather sharp in the reviews I read. The lens is sharp and it focuses rather quietly and quickly. However, it only lasted about 2 years before the aperture started sticking. It quickly became unusable unless I wanted to shoot wide open. Like a fool, I purchased another one. I had it in my camera bag attached to my camera. My bag fell about 2 feet to the ground and the lens broke clean in half. Sigma charged me $70 to fix it. Also, when I bought my Elan 7, I had to send it to them again to have them fix the electronics to work on the newer camera. Don't be fooled. It's not worth the cheap price and nice features. Either spend the extra money on Canon's 28-135mm IS lens or the Canon's 28-105mm lens."
1,Terrible quality,"First off, my scope came with a defective part: The pan handle was bent where it attaches to the mount, making it wobble when loosened or tightened. This also may have been the cause of the scope's major flaw: When the scope is pointed up, the mount can't support the weight and it slowly drifts upward. The tri-ocular holder is useless because when any adjustments are made, the scope moves out of alignment. The finderscope (viewfinder) mentioned in the other review is NOT right side up nor built in. Almost the only metal parts are the telescope tube, tripod legs, and eyepieces. The rest is flimsy plastic.This telescope is not useful for anything. Don't buy it."
3,Sorority Row,"During a party in the Theta-Pi sorority house, the sister Megan plays a prank with her unstable boyfriend Garrett simulating an OD after using pills. Her sisters Jessica, Claire, Ellie, Cassidy and Garrett's sister Chugs suggest to dump her ""body"" in a lake and the stressed Garrett sticks the tire iron through the Megan's chest killing her. Cassidy decides to call the police, but the sisters are convinced to dispose the body in a shaft and keep in secret under the leadership of Jessica that blackmails Cassidy. Eight months later, in their graduation party, the sisters receive a creepy message with the picture of the tire iron in the beginning of a nightmarish night. ""Sorority Row"" is a slasher movie that thankfully doesn't tarnish the memory of a horror classic. It's a worth-wild watch for horror fans, especially if you don't take it too seriously."
4,Better the second time around!!,"I went out to see this film when it first came to the American theaters and felt sorta let down by it, now seeing it for the first time on home video I actually enjoyed it for the first time.It's a fun slasher flick that doesn't try to take itself to seriosuly and gives the scares and thrills that most horror films need to scare!!"
2,I'm Sorry They All Didn't Die,"Think Halloween meets Heathers. Mean sorrority girls are killed one by one by an unknown killer. The killer is so unknown that when the identity is revealed the reason is sooooo stupid, that no one would have ever guessed.This is your traditional slasher film that follows the same pattern as all the 70s and 80s flicks. Rumor Willis (daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore) is annoying. Poor Carrie Fisher is wasted in this movie. In fact, I can't understand why she starred in this crappy movie to begin with."
1,I know what you did last....Semester?!,"**Spoilers** When the lead cast refers to the killers weapon as ""pimped out"" or ""he pimped it"" (tried to repress this scene) you know you have hit ROCK BOTTOM! Put together a graduation gown, a tire iron and absolutely NO PLOT and you have Sorority Row. This film had potential until the characters talk like they are from the ghetto! Come on people, this is a Sorority, not the hood. This films only redeeming qualities are the beginning and a few gory kills. The acting and surprise killer? LOL! This film will have you thinking twice about the enire horror genre. Rent it cheap!"
3,could be better,"I seen this movie yes to tell the truth the plot was interesting sort of like ""jawbreaker"" meets the sority house, that being said lets get in the movie a horrible prank gone wrong a girl get's killed by a tire iron. Never seen that comming! The killing in the movie were mostly inventive and original. The use of a tire irpn being ussed as a murder weapon is not original but how the tire iron was mad how ever was very inventive. At one time I thought I had the plot figured out and I didn't I just want to point out one other thing when the killer is known can you say ""Ritalin"" I mean the killer is jumpy like he had way to much caffine sort of like ""ya man all these people are wasted and I need another fix man"" I thought the killer althoe original could have been portrayed a lot better as lets face it he is no ""Billy Loomis"" (scream) or ""Michael Myers"" (obviously Holloween"" all in all not a bad movie but could be better."
4,Sorority Row,Another film with hot young girls getting slashed. It has a simple plot. A prank goes wrong and someone dies. The girls keep it a secret and then get knocked off one by one by some revengeful person. The deaths are interesting and involve a tire iron. I watched it twice and i can easily watch it again.
3,Not that bad at all.,"I kinda watched this on a whim and I liked it. Not high art, or even great scares.. but it's not a bad little slasher film. Some cool kills, decent acting and some naked breasts. What else can you ask for from a film like this? Great throwback to the days of 80s horror, with a more polished modern look."
3,3 & 1/2 Stars - Better than i thought it would be,"Haven't seen one of these in awhile. A decent recent slasher flick. out of all the recent horror movies I've been watching lately. this is probably one of the top ones. Its not excellent, however, it does have a lot of the classic slasher cliche's. I would recommend it but don't expect some genius plot, script, etc. its a slasher!"
1,"Silly, Simplistic and Mindless",Just a total waste of time and money! How can they spend big bucks on this when there are up-and-coming filmmakers that could use the dough to turn in a quality production? This is a total loser...0 (zero) in my book. The script could have been written by my 6-year-old granddaughter...and the generous dose of drugs and alcohol makes this a film that should have been burned in the final sequence. I can't express in words how bad this film is. Don't even rent it. There is nothing to say about it that earns a commentary. I've seen better TV commercials for peanut butter!
4,Suspenseful,this all star female cast makes this movie worth watching is suspenseful and keeps you guessing on who the killer is. I have it 4 stars
2,Kinda predictable,"There were plenty of attractive actresses in this movie, but that didn't make up for a weak plot and mediocre performances, even by veteran Carrie Fisher, who played the gun-toting house mother. For fans of the gorgeous Audrina Patridge, she makes a very brief appearance in the beginning of the film."
4,Worth Watching,"I'm not a fan of this genre, but the producer and director did a good job setting the tone, setting up suspense, intense moments, clever use of sounds and transitions to trick the viewer into flinching at expectation of intense scenes etc. Clever twists make you want to continue watching while allowing you to participate through guessing on who the murderer is. I surprisingly liked this film and respect how it was placed together and done.I definitely recommend this one."
1,Bad Interpretation,"This man, Walton, teaches from such a foreign view that you wonder why this book was published. While certain academic fields have gone to further our understanding of the Bible and the Biblical times, Walton seems to have come to his own conclusions about the Bible before having actually read the Bible. The school I go to, Wayland Baptist University-San Antonio, requires this to be used as our textbook. This doesn't surprise me since the University is Liberal as is. If you are required to purchase this book for class, just read what you need to and retain it only as necessary for the class. The rest of the time, everything in there can be disregarded."
3,Captain Janeway?,"Ok..so this was an ok episode. I really liked the story line except Kathryn Janeway has always been this tough, gung-ho captain and now, she and Chakotay are stuck on ""new earth"" and she compleatly changes. For example, she can't run and carry a case at the same time. Janeway's character is totally different in this episode. Plus, I don't really think someone conducting scientific expirements and gardening would be marching around in an old dress, especially if you watched The Next Generation and saw what they wore off duty. It just isn't a ""logical"" choice. In Resolutions, Kathryn starts talking to a monkey...not that talking to animals is a bad thing, but when she does it, it's like she's talking to a small child. Wierd. As a die-hard J/Cer, this episode didn't go the way I wanted it to, but I enjoyed it anyway since we know Star Trek writers will never go for this Captain/Commander relationship."
4,"""Finally something good from the south""","No, 'Foma' is not perfect, but yes, it is great. If you are one of the few that haven't heard ""Sister"" then you have problems. This a beautiful song with driving guitars and perfect vocals. In fact, Zac's vocals are perfect through-out the record. ""Passion"" is one of those bitter-sweet love songs that is good for any style of listener. ""Happy Song"" is probably the best on the album. The little aspect of breaking the guitars down to absolutly nothing but screeching is interesting. Songs like ""Wire"" ""Drink the Fear"" and ""Foma"" are all good rockers but with a little somthing extra. Buy this album only if you like rock. 'Grunge' is something this album is not. It isn't even alternative. The best way to catogorize it, is your own personal opinion. Its defently a good strong album."
4,I like it,"There really are so many better records that one could buy for better songwriting, but I generally enjoy albums that are consistent, atmospheric and are therefore more than the sum of their parts. Most ""best of"" albums consist of good songs, but lack atmosphere and so are usually no more than the sum of their parts. Using this logic, Foma is one of my favourites - listenable songs, nothing too annoying, but an atmosphere and consistency that pulls it all together in a very satisfying manner (other favourites of mine using this reasoning include Live's Secret Samadi and Natalie Merchant's Ophelia). The boys here do put a good melody over a very chunky riff, which, if you're in the mood to let out a bit of steam, makes this a very fun album. A dredging of the mid-90s mass of guitar-toting wannabes wouldn't be a success if this fine album didn't get caught in the net."
3,"Not bad, not great.","Sounds like everything else of this genre or era. I never feel bad for listening to it, but it never ""moves"" me either. It's neither bad nor good. When a Nixon song makes its way through the shuffle random on winamp I don't feel the need to skip it, but I never seek it out either. This rings true for all their albums. Easily interchangeable with so many other bands and maybe thats why they're not around anymore?"
3,"Good Sense of Place, Not So Good Sense of Plot","Claire Reynier is a fifty-something rare book expert who is thinking about aging. She compares and competes with her old college friends--who looks better, has a better husband, better job, better divorce etc. A former sorority sister cons Claire and others from the old college group, then turns up murdered. Claire is a suspect. She then investigates all the old friends to clear herself. Author, Judith Van Gieson, does a great job with atmosphere and her writing is very readable. She has some big plot and plausibility problems though."
5,Great collection at a great price,Great retrospective of the 70's with 50 films from that era at a price that can't be beat...and the quality is not bad.
4,"Nice bike for the price, but needed adjustments at a bike shop","So far my son and I both enjoy riding this bike, though we plan to put on a more comfortable seat soon. For the price, one certainly gets a lot of nice features.One thing to consider carefully before buying a bike online is that if the bike needs adjustments, you'll either have to return the bike or pay for the adjustments at a local bike shop. This bike required that both brakes needed to be reinstalled, plus the rear wheel was not true. Fixing the front brake was easy, but the rear brake couldn't be fixed until the wheel was trued at the bike shop."
3,Fairly good but definitely not great.,"I have ridden bicycles for most of my life and have been riding the Schwinn for a couple months now. Right out of the box the bike needs to go straight to a bike shop for an adjustment that will cost at least fifty dollars. I can fix and adjust most things on a bike but after spending hours assembling and adjusting everything, I noticed that the wheels were so far out of true that the bike was unrideable. The bike does fairly well on the trail, the shocks handle the bumps well and the gears are smooth after the initial adjustment. My biggest complaint with the bike is its weight. Previously I bought a brand new Motiv bicycle for $250 and I could pick it up easily with one hand. The Schwinn feels like lead weight and only a weightlifter could lift it with one hand."
3,Just for big people.,"First, I'm a huge fan of Fuller brushes. The quality is fantastic. This one is no different. I'm sure it will last for years. But this brush didn't work particularly well for me. The design and shape, like their original bath brush is specially made to wrap around your body and get you clean everywhere. But in this version, the brush is too long and the curve is too loose to work for me.I'm guessing this brush would be spectacular for anybody who weighs 300 pounds or more. In fact, if you are one of those people, I would strongly encourage you to buy this brush because I'll bet there's nothing else like it. Maybe you'll end up as big a fan of Fuller brushes as I am.But if you're more typical sized, I'd recommend the original bath brush instead (if you are planning to use it to clean yourself in the shower) or the body brush (if you are looking to brush and invigorate your skin)."
5,"Wonderful Product, Great, Clean Smell","Wondeful productt, great, clean smell - everyone who walks in mentions the clean smell - love it - have in many rooms of my home."
5,Love the White Tea scent,"I was first introduced to fragrant reed diffusers when a bed & breakfast my husband and I stayed at had a White Tea one in our room. The scent was so light and pleasing that I bought this one when I returned home from our vacation. I have tried other fragrances since, but the White Tea scent is still one of my favorites."
5,Aromatherapy Plus,"The Pearlessence White Tea diffuser gives out a lovely, relaxing scent in three of my rooms. Not only are myrooms scented for guests, but I enjoy the aromatherapy each and every day."
3,Being Single is Okay....,"First of all, I really like Bishop Jakes. I try not to miss his TV program if possible.This book, ""Promises From God For Single Women"" was okay. It was an easy read but not quite what I was expecting.Every book I read I look for new insight, knowledge and excitement.I would recomend this book to others, however, I would let them know it isn't exciting nor the kind of book you don't put down like ""He Motions""."
2,Disappointed -- doesn't address my situation,"I will confess that I didn't read this book thoroughly. I read the introduction, realized it probably wasn't going to speak to me, and skimmed through the rest.The author seems to focus on single women's problems with wanting to look good (i.e. lose weight), jealously/rivalry among other single friends, and tendency to settle for Mr. Wrong rather than waiting for Mr. Right. All of which are appropriate for singles in their 20s and even early 30s. However, if you're past your mid-30s then these things probably aren't really issues for you anymore, and this book probably won't speak to your needs now (that is my experience, anyway).For older singles, I highly recommend ""They Were Single Too"" by David Hoffeditz."
3,More like a daily devotional,"Not as deep as I would have liked. Very simple and to the point. Generally about a couple of paragraphs per topic. So, it's nice, but very simple. Decent book though. Maybe for a coffee table or for just a daily devotional."
5,Book Review,This book is a must read for single women! It is set up by topics and I plan on referring back to it when I need to. Always enjoy watching and reading anything by TD Jakes!
4,Promises from God for Single Women,Excellent reading and appropriate for the single woman seeking deeper knowledge and understanding from a spirtual perspective.
1,Not Impressed At All,"The introduction to the book read and sounded like T.D.Jakes, but the rest of the book seemed like it was written by someone else. The language does not read like Jakes at all. I was extremely disappointed with the book."
5,Just what I needed to read...,"As a single, saved women in her late 20's I was getting discouraged with being alone. At times I got very depressed and questioned God as to why my life was not moving in that regard. I brought this book this morning and finished it in one sitting (it is not long). As soon as I began reading and meditating on what was being said I began to feel the Lord speaking to me through the book. It addresses issues such as loneliness, forgiveness, betrayal, sex and other important items. Each section brings you God's word and what he says in regards to each of the topics. I am reminded to put my faith to work and trust in God's word. He has so much more for me than I can imagine and I have to be obedient and wait for his time, not my time. If you are feeling a bit (or a lot down) about being single this is a great read to get your mind focused back on Christ and his promises for us."
5,Still reading...but loving it!,"Although this book did not specifically address the need I had when I bought it, it is an AWESOME book that would remind you of God's love for you!"
1,POORLY WRITTEN,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.. THIS BOOK IT NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ... AS A SINGLE PERSON. I WAS LOOKING FOR TD TO UPLIFT ME AND PROVIDE ME WITH WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND INSIPIRATION. POORLY WRITTEN.. NOT A GOOD BY BARELY GOT THROUGH THE 1ST CHAPTER . 2 THUMBS DOWN......
2,FOR IDIOTS ONLY!,"Just as the title suggests, it is a book for idiots only. I have to admit, I was an idiot for buying this book! I ordered this book along with Street Smarts, Hit & Run Trading, Stock Trading Wizard, and Day Trading into the Millennium. I recommend any of the other books as a much, much better choice.Why is it that amazon does not discount the GOOD books?"
4,Great Book For Beginners,"This book is perfect for those of use who wan't to just get to know a little more about daytrading. Other books on the topic are much more advanced and assume that you already know a whole lot. This book is great for learning terms, concepts, and the basic ins and outs of the daytrading world. Beware of some typos and mistakes throughout. Otherwise, an excellent book."
5,Does what it's supposed to,"I got this so I could repurpose and old phone memory card for use in a camera. does what it's supposed to, and saved me from buying a new sdcard."
2,Of course,"Nel Nodding's writings deserve praise in that she is among the first contemporary scholars to tell us about the importance of a caring curriculum for children. It is also nice to say that if we learn to care, this is better than the didactic forms of authoritarian compliance oriented character education going on in most of our schools. However, an entire book to say this may not be what we need. Also, not once in the entire book is their any reference to caring about Nature. To anthropocentrize the concept of caring is dangerous in these times when our environment is catestrophically deteriorating.If you are inclined to want to know why her ideas are different than the Christian leaders of character education, then I suggest you buy the book. If you already agree that caring, spirituality and a more balanced, holistic view of the world is what you want, see my own book on Teaching Virtues at www.teachingvirtues.net for a practical application."
5,Brilliant,"I want to hear more from Will Sumner, and I want to make sure everyone buys his album(S)! His cd should be featured on the Weather Channel, since it's better than anything they are playing of late. I had the chance to meet this guy and he's as exotic as his music - so see him LIVE and buy, buy, buy..."
5,Sumner creates solid groove,"Will Sumner, with his latest endeavor, has succeeded in creating one of the most enticingly thematic albums in the latin jazz/fusion genre. Each passage is a thread that weaves it's own emotional coloring into the whole. Some light hearted some pleasurably moody, but all guided by Sumners masterful guitar and rythmic arrangements. Not yet widely known on a national scale, he has for many years enjoyed a huge following in the Minneapolis /St. Paul and the San Diego, CA areas. My guess is, with this thoughtful collection, the cat will be out of the bag. I will patiently bide my time on the waves of Desde Mi Corazon while waiting for his next installment."
3,Mediocre,"I don't have a great deal of dart board experience, but I know what I want and this board doesn't provide it. The BristleTech is thin enough that the darts often bounce off - you can hear them hit the plastic behind the BristleTech. They also bounce off the separators. The soft-tip darts bend very easily. The remote scoring needs to be pointed at the board in a certain range and area, so don't assume you can just put it anywhere. Sometimes (1 in 20 shots) the score doesnt recognize, so you have to push the section manually, so if this occurs on a bounce-off shot - you're out of luck (you won't know what to score). Also, the battery compartment is on the back of the board, which means if you mount it securely, plan on unmounting it to replace the batteries.Can you play darts on this board - yes, but it's not ideal. I am looking for something to replace this."
2,PRODUCT # 24539,"THE ENVELOPE IS FINE, BUT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SEALANT ON THE FLAP TO SECURE IT. I WILL BE LOOKING FOR A BETTER QUALITY PRODUCT."
5,A Useful Tool For Implementing ABA,"I bought this book after my 3 year old son was diagnosed with PDD and I was determined to do SOMETHING for him while we were awaiting his enrollment in school. Utilizing the information allowed me to face the diagnosis head on, rather than be afraid of the uncertainly I initially felt about raising an autistic child. Within a month of putting selected sections of the book into practice, friends who had not seen us during that time were amazed at the changes in my son and thought he must be receiving formal therapy. After a year in Special Ed, plus related therapeutic services, my son tested in the non-autistic range. I believe this book was the first stepping stone - allowing me to help my son ""learn"" how to learn. While ABA is not the only treatment for autism, those who wish to implement it will find this book an indispensible addition to their libraries."
4,Not for a Non verbal child,It's an excellent book but is not for a non verbal child. There is definitely a lack of training exercises for non verbal children.
5,Make a difference with Making a Difference!,"Excellent for those who love children and want to make a positive difference in their lives! The quality of this book puts it in the category of professional. Not light reading. This book goes beyond theory, to practice. Helpful for people working with those on the spectrum."
5,"Penn Performance Casting Reels-GD 535, GS 545. GD 555","All three of these reels are updated versions of older Penn reels, like the Jigmaster series. These reels are a quantum leap forward from the older ones. They are very lightweight, being graphite reels, extremely strong, have super smooth drags, and have very high-speed retrieve ratios (6:1 for the 535 and 545, and 5.3:1 for the 555). For what you are getting, it is a real bargain - all three reels sell for $129. They are a pleasure to use and I highly recommend them."
3,Are you kidding?,"This book is ridiculously overpriced! First of all, one book will not make you a communicator especially in the sciences because every situation is as different as the people involved. Second, communication skills, even for scientists, are best learned through many experiences that require continously refining the approach needed to be effective. This book has good content, but the price is absurd for what you get. If it were priced at what it is worth, which is about $40 not $150, it would be a good place to start. There are many good books available at a reasonable price that discuss scientific communication skills and consulting that can be applied to any technical dicipline. The scam of this book is that it makes the reader believe that statistics requires some special approach that is different from other scientific areas, which in my experience is nonsense. Either you possess the ability to break it down in ""layman's terms"" or you don't."
5,Great camera at any price,"I have done much research and reading on this camera before pulling the trigger and I'm very happy with decision so far - coming from an P/S camera - this camera does required some time to know all of the many features that this camera has - but once you have that ""right settings for your shots"" - the pictures will be amazing."
4,A great methodology for increasing productivity & profits.,Area Activity Analysis provided me with an excellent step-by-step methodology for increasing productivity & profits.Of special note was the free Knowledge Management & Process Improvement Software included with the book.
5,Vision--leaders share it--this book explains it.,"Leaders have vision--they see beyond today and tomorrow. In order for that vision to come to fruition, a leader must share their vision--they have to have it out in the open, they must share, talk, communicate their vision. In this book the author has done an excellent job in the stories he shares, the examples he gives and the benefits of looking beyond today and the benefits of sharing a vision with others. Leadership is a role we all can take on daily, but communicating a vision through leadership is what we all strive to do.This book is an excellent read, by an excellent author and leader. He did his home work on this book and it shows."
1,not as advertised,Items did not have any cushion on grip. I am now concerned if I was given an inferior product.
3,Cute But Not Durable,"We got this for our son's 1st birthday. It really does not seem too sturdy. It wobbles back and forth and the swing does not really have a big span. He loves the slide and standing on top of it, but that is it. Not worth $120."
4,Big Fun for little tike !,"My granddaughter loves this little persons, she's 9 months old, play set. What a great picture I took of her while in the swing. A smile from ear to ear. Thanks for the memories !"
2,Unhappy with this toy,I purchased this toy at our local ToysRus for our 10 month old son. We put it together as the product says 12M to 4years. We are taking it apart and returning it. The swing barely moves and it is extremely low to the ground. The slide has no side rails so a parent would have to hold on to the child as he/she slides down. If a child is able to climb up the stairs and use the wheel/scope I don't see them able to fit in the swing.
1,ages for this product should be revised,"I purchased this product for my then 20 month old. She liked the side froom the moment we put it together, however the swing was too short for her. Now that she is 2 the swing is too little and does not swing that high. She also weighs more (24 lbs) and when she is climbing the slide or swinging the plastic side pieces shift back and forth. Yes, we have them as tight as we can get them. This product was not worth what we paid for it especially since we got maybe 6 months of use out of it, and that's a streatch."
1,Too quickly outgrown for the price!,"We bought this for our 15 month old son. He loved the telescope, but needed someone to help him climb up to the platform. The swing is way too small, little movement, and so low to the ground that his feet dragged the ground by the time he was 18 months old. I think we should have spent the money (and a lot less of it) on a toddler swing that we could hang from a tree and a seperate slide that has real steps. The picture makes this look alot bigger than it is. Also, it's very light, which makes it feel like it could tip over easily. I talked our friends out of buying one for their two year old."
4,Great First Swing Set,"My 5 month old daughter received this swing set as a gift. She is in the 95th percentile for height, so she is pretty tall for her age. She loves the swing and has plenty of room to grow. The swing doesn't go very high, but it is perfect for her age. The box says that it is for ages 1 year to 4 years of age. I'm not sure that a 4 year old could go in the swing. The slide is small, but a great length for the little ones. At 5 months my daughter is more interested in the swing anyway. We have a small yard and this fits just perfectly. We would have just bought an infant swing for a tree, but there are no trees in the yard. This is the next best thing. It is sturdy, and two days after we put in together we had a snow storm here in NY and there are small holes to drain the water. I think this is a great product for little ones."
1,blah,"definitely not worth the price, and is so small that by the time your child is old enough to be in it they're too big for it. It's way smaller than it appears in the photos, I returned it and bought an entire outdoor swing set from toys r us for 20 bucks more, something to play with as a toddler and can be grown into, way more worth it."
3,yes but no,"After reading the reviews I was sceptical but I bought it anyway. My daughter is 1 1/2 years old and loves climbing the wall but the slide seems wayyy too short for her (and she's small for her age). The swing was useless until my husband drilled holes in the seat and put S hooks instead of bars so it's worth swinging in, but the only thing is, is that is not very sturdy at all. My opinion is don't buy it-but if you're like me, you read the reviews and still say well I'm sure it will be great for my kid.. overall my daughter does have lots of fun on it but by the end of the summer she will have already out grown it."
3,"Buy the slide, forget the swing","Overall, this is a fairly nice toy. I agree with most of the other reviews stating that the toy is not difficult to assemble and relatively sturdy once assembled. The issue I have with this toy is that the swing part is fairly useless. The swing itself doesn't go far enough back or forth to really be fun for our 17 month old daughter. Also, the swing has a seat belt that you can use (with some difficulty), but the swing will cause some minor spills if your child tries to get in/out of it while you aren't watching. On the other hand, our daughter absolutely loves the slide portion of this toy. If we had to do it again, we would buy the version of this toy that only includes the slide half and find a separate swing."
1,"Great slide, swing needs much more work.","We bought this set for our two girls, 3 1/2 and 22 months. The slide is wonderfull. As soon as they are down they are tearing around to go again. The climb took some time for my younger daughter to get the hang of but now she's a real pro! The spy glass and wheel are a big hit with both my girls, I just wish there was enough room for them to be used simultaneously.The swing is such a disapointment that we took that part of it off! The seat is big enought for my older daughter to sit in it, but what's the point when it's so low to the ground that her knees are bent more than 90 degrees when she sits in the seat! Even my youngest had to concentrate on lifting her legs to swing and not have her feet catch.I understand the idea is to allow younger kids to swing on their own without going too high or fast, but if they can't swing at all it defeats the purpose!All in all, we bought ourselves an expensive slide with a couple of fun toys on top."
1,A waste of money!,"This toy is a HUGE waste of money. The swing is terrible, it's slick first of all so my little girl has a really hard time staying in the seat, even strapped in. Second, the swing motion is so very limited that it barely moves back and forth. Third, the slide is so hard to climb up that my little girl has slipped and bumped her mouth and head more than her fair share of times, not to mention that it's way too short to be any fun at all, even for a toddler. This thing is going in the garage sale SOON! We opted for a Fisher Price Toddler swing which we hung from a wood frame in the back yard and a small Fisher Price slide that's WAY easier to climb up and WAY more fun to slide down. There are better ways to waste your money than on this toy."
5,maddis new favorite thing,"I bought this toy this year for my daughter Maddi as her spring gift and she adores it. She is 13 months old and she has learned to go down the slide and push herself in the swing in the one month that we have had it. Every time the sun is out she crawls over to the slider and says ""Mama swing, Mama slide"". I suggest this toy for any parent who is looking for a good and safe outdoor toy for their little one."
5,Very Pleased,"We got this from Santa for our 14 month old. He really likes it. The rock climber is a little hard for him, but I'm sure he will get the hang of it. The swing is fine and he can get down himself. All over it's a great starter swing set."
3,Okay as long as you didn't buy it for the swing,"We bought this for my son for his 1st birthday. At first he was petrified of the swing, not sure why because he likes swings. He also wasn't really able to climb up the wall. Once he got up there he liked to play with the wheel and the spy glass. Now that he is 15 months old he is able to climb the wall and can even climb up the slide. He loves to do both and go down the slide too but the swing stinks. The way it is made the bars go up inside the plastic and it leaves very little room for the bars to move so it dopesn't swing much at all. I'd say you'd be better off just to buy a slide and wall without the swing."
4,My Lil'One Enjoys Very much,"I Bought this for my son at 7 1/2 months for the swing, I had to make a set cover due to the slippery set(But bath tub stickers you stick on the floor of the tub for grip work too). And he enjoyed crawling under the slide. Now he's 9 months and figured how to climb the back, and like any toy supervision is a absolute most.This toy has won the heart of my son, but I've seen a lot of disappointed buyers say it was too small or to hard to climb and the swing was limited. This is no swing set, of course the swing is limited, if not it would tip over and it's attended for little ones that shouldn't be swung high anyway! Well, my son is 24lb and 33inchs and thats big for 9 months, but he has no problems working this toy and has pently of room to grown into this toy! My Nephew and niece is 2 and 4 and they are average size for their age they enjoy and have no problems playing with this ether."
2,Not happy with my purchase,-Swing has half the sway of a typical battery operated infant swing-Slides climbing wall not as easy for younger baby to successfully use as a slide with step ladder-Set has many holes per customer service this is necessary for water to drain after rain however it also allows bugs to get inside the hollow plastic and nest. Not a good outdoor toy-Prior to my putting it outside my son did enjoy it inside for about 2 months (months 14-15) but since the slide is short and the swing is useless he tired of it so quickly I ended up getting rid of it.
3,Not for tall toddlers,"We bought this for my little girl right before her 1st birthday. She is a very tall child, but there is no way this is for a child up to 4 years old. She used the swing last summer, but even then her feet were almost to the ground. The swing is more for a child 6-12 mths. The slide and climbing area is better for a child 1-2 yrs. It is very durable and compact, but you will only get about 1 year of use out of it. I wish we would have invested in a bigger Little Tykes Climber and Swing Set for the money we spent on this one."
3,Age range off,"I bought this product because of its small size, but fun activities. I am keeping it in my house during the winter months for my 11 month old. He loves the slide, climbing wall, and steering wheel at the top, but I was disappointed with the swing. It does not have a good swing range and so my son gets bored with it easily. The swing might be better suited for a younger child."
2,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT- TERRIBLE!!,"I bought this swing set for my nephew's first birthday! Once we had it set up & running we put my nephew in it.. the swing is TERRIBLE!! Every time we pushed him the legs came up off the ground like the whole thing was going to tip over!! This is more for a 4 mo. old. The slide was much better, but i would NOT reccommend this for anyone. The next day i loaded it in my truck & took it right back. TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE!!!"
1,Very disappointed,"It's states on the box this swing set is suitable for children between the ages of 1-4, my daughter is 2 and the swing is too small, her feet were scraping the ground once I put her in the swing. The sliding board was okay, but this item is too expensive for a month or two of use, it seems it would be more appropriate for an infant that can sit up unassisted up to the age of 2."
3,Castle Swing Along Climber,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. We just put it up (April) and it's missing the captains wheel - now how to get that without disassembling and taking it back to the store.?. Assembly in 20 minutes? Maybe if there's 4 people working on it together. My daughter is 20 mos old and is small for her age - when she's in the swing - her feet touch the ground. The swing was the main 'selling' point of this product...now we can't even use it. I wish I could have tried someone elses out before we purchased this - then I never would have bought it. Overall - it's a good product, looks durable. Only time will tell."
3,could be more sturdy,"I find it isn't that sturdy.We bought this for our son's 1st. b-day, he's almost 14 mos. now and he's been walking for months, even starting to walk backwards,but has no interest yet in climbing the rocks.He doesn't care to swing, but plays w/ the swing while standing by it.He likes the wheel and scope, hopefully he'll grow into it.I would wait to get this for an at least 18 month old. Every child is different, mine perfers to run around at this point."
1,Don't buy this product!!,"I am returning this item. What a waste of money. The swing has little to no motion, the whole unit sways and moves around when I do try and push my 10 month old son (weighs 25 lbs) on it. The slide has such a short angle I can't see him ever having fun sliding down. I would not recommend this to anyone. I hope the store will take it back, we still have the box and receipt.I am going to get another product that has high reviews and is about the same in price."
2,Not good for younger toddlers,"I got this toy as a gift for my 1 year olds birthday and we are taking it back.The swing catches when it goes back so her head bangs on the plastic.The steps to the slide are awful, she can't clamber up them and she has been walking for 3 months so she isn't just beginning. The only fun part is the telescope on the top. Save your money and buy something else!"
3,"Toddlers may like the slide, but the swing is too short","My 21 month-old got this as a first birthday gift, and he began to use it after he was 15 months old. He enjoys climbing on the platform, looking through the plastic telescope, and sliding down the colorful slide, but the swing is no bigger than an infant swing you'd place a 3 month-old in. My son much prefers the swing set at our neighborhood playground to this pathetic little excuse for a swing.Assembly was easy, albeit long, and it is durable enough to be dragged around my backyard and has weathered a few months outdoors in extreme temperatures."
4,best buy for a first-time gym !!!,"This being my son's first gym set, is perfect for him. He loves both the slide and the swing and its perfectly mobile both as an outside play set or inside. i would recommend this to anyone looking for their first gym, which is both fun and functionally safe !!"
3,General explanation of data warehousing,"I found it to have a good explanation of general data warehousing terms and concepts, but not enought depht in terms of planning and designing for a data warehouse. I wouldn't recommend buying it."
1,Buy the Dodge/Gorman Book Instead!,"The Dodge and Gorman book is much, much better than this one. Also - buy a copy of Ralph Kimballs Data Warehouse Toolkit - its applies to DW and DM's. Another good book is Kimball's Data Warehouse Lifecycle book, but the Toolkit book is more concise."
1,"More ad for Oracle, less data warehousing","OK, if you work with Oracle there are some things, that will help you. Otherwise, if you search for more practical or even theoretical books, then look better for Ralph Kimball. This guy is the best in this field."
3,pretty good,"basic stirrer set. They were a little longer than expected, but they work. Solidly built. What can I say...it stirs the drinks. :-)"
4,Stylish Stirrers,The stirrers are very stylish. I had been looking for set of silver ones and was surprised at how difficult they are to find. My only small complaint is that you have to be careful washing them because the metal can bend. Other than that they do the job.
1,Vista Users: Do not buy this product!!!,"This product does not work for Windows Vista. I received this product and was very disappointed to find that it did not work on my Operating System. Would probably be great for XP, but I have Vista."
3,cute but my baby got bored easily,I thought it was cute but my baby got bored from this easily.... Had to upgrade to a more entertaining one with music
3,An interesting series of short stories,"This is an interesting collection of short stories combined with African folklore. I bought the book to give as a gift along with the movie ""The Visitor."""
3,DC Harvard Alums Book Club recommends The Prophet of Zongo Street,"This pleasant collection of short stories has something for everyone, especially those who might like to imagine everyday life in West Africa and immigrant experiences in the United States. (The book club average was actually 3.5 stars, but Amazon cannot accommodate half measures.) As other reviews have noted, the best stories take place on Zongo Street, where Ali weaves a vivid tapestry. Many club members felt that the stories based in the US didn't seem as touching. There was almost complete agreement that the story ""Rachmaninov"" was the least favorite, with some members suggesting the plot line seems derived from the movie ""Pulp Fiction"". The club was divided on ""Live In"", some members wishing this story was either longer, or expanded into a complete novel."
2,disappointed!,"I bought this to replace an old travel Rummikub, because the numbers were wearing off the tiles so badly. I'm disappointed with the new ones for 3 reasons.1. The new tiles are inconveniently tiny - their fronts are about a quarter the size of the tile fronts on the old tiles, and they're very thin.2. The blue and black numbered tiles are hard to tell apart. The blue numbers on the new tiles are much darker than the blue numbers on the old tiles.3. The 'patented' tile holders have an annoying design such that the whole thing tips and spills the tiles if one bumps the front overhang.I couldn't see any of these problems before I bought the set, because there doesn't seem to be any description of the size."
3,Travel Rummikub,"Perfect complement for folks who like to travel, it's small and compact and convenient to pack in a bag. However, we would have prefered a bit larger size, perhaps one half of the regular Rummy cub tiles, the tiles of this game are small and can be lost easily if we are not careful."
1,Product is cheap junk,"I should have known better. Cheap plastic everywhere, the case is too wobbly to stay closed for long - you can see that the hinge will break any minute and the tiles will spill everywhere. The tiles are mere chips of plastic not worthy of the name 'tile', and you know they will not last more than one or two games without getting lost. Certainly they would never survive the abuse of travel. Don't waste your money, pay more and buy the real thing. I returned this as soon as I looked at it."
3,Expected More,We really enjoy the game. Bought this for travel.It is well made..but...it is not easy to distinguish between the yellow and red tiles and therefore make erroneous moves. We will stick to the full sized set even when we travel.
2,Awkward to Use/Handle,"I love Rummikub and the notion of a travel version to play any where was VERY attractive. However, the pieces are so small and flimsy they are hard to keep in the player tray and keep in place on a playing surface. A magnetic playing surface / tile combination would be much more functional and enjoyable. I'd not buy this version again."
3,VERY VERY SMALL,"Rummikub normal is very versatile so unless you are very strapped for space this game may prove too small. The game itself is still a lot of fun, and from an educational standpoint chess-like because you have to think about 4 moves ahead of where you currently are."
3,Trave Rummikub Game,I was disappointed with the very small size of the tiles. I purchased this for a 10 year old girl and she was excited to have atravelling set.
3,Very Small,The pieces are very very small. It is hard to pick them up and play with them. It is definitely a travel size game. But I do wish the pieces were a little larger.
4,Very Cool,Got it as a gift for someone and they loved it.Everything is very nicely made and it fits anywhere.
1,travel rummikub,"The game is too small, I wanted a travel game but the pieces are too small, For the price it is not worth returning"
3,Hmmmm not sure,I know it is a travel game but sokehow I expected a little bigger tile I do not feel like I can get the pieces hold. Not jumping withjoy
1,No magnifying glass in it!,"The tiles are so small, we should buy one magnifying glass for each player!Each tile number is about 1x1.5 cm (it is very tiny travel Rummikub)."
3,Rather tedious translation,"I find the translation rather tedious, unnecessarily difficult to read, and sentence structures awkward at times. It may have to do with being written in 1932 and the translator trying to be faithful to the original text. But there must be a better way, perhaps a modern way, to make it more readable and accessible. The content itself is not that difficult to grasp for those who have read Pali cannon and studied phenomenology, etc. But it does take time to parse through sentences in an effort to ""retranslate""."
5,What I needed.,I needed to make some spline joints using 1/8 hard board. This router bit worked perfectly made clean cuts. No issues whatsoever.
3,its ok,my swiss army knife gets far more use. i know that the blades don't lock and it doesn't have pliers but still i think a swiss army knife is just easer to carry and use. its more an issue of preference. the quality of the new wave is just ok. i say just ok because the pliers when folded scrape against something inside the handles. you my call that no big deal but i expect my tools to work smooth with no flaws at this price.
3,Giant?,The product is great. My complaint is that the description does not tell the weight of each roll. I was looking for the 2.25 oz. size. These are 1 oz. each.
1,Not what came to the door,Gun that was delivered is not what's in the picture. Grip is all wrong. I would not recommend. I felt product was not represented well.
5,Really Cute Outfits - Really Easy Crochet,"These doll clothes are easy to make - but they look really nice when they're done! Styles are fresh and new, they don't look dated. Really nice selection, especially the sweaters. Some of the patterns look complex, but they are very basic. My 9 year old daughter made one of the sweaters. The parka is adorable, and looks great on a teddy bear too."
3,"Not the usual ""Lameager"" Lameness....","It was neat to see the ship (I always liked the ship design) flying high over LA at night. That was cool. The plot was even pretty decent, for a ""Lameager"" episode, but the often-hammy performances by Kate Mulgrew (my personal LAST choice for the captain's role) and her slap-happy bunch made my teeth hurt at times."
4,Exceptional Sound - Watch out for the Static Charge!,The sound is great. My only problem is the static charge the brush creates on my records. You can always leave the brush up so it's not a problem. Just watch out for the static!
5,"Nice sound, good value","With my recently acquired upscale turntable, I needed a new phono cartridge. This one was highly recommended and works great. There is a lot of internet discussion about the placement and alignment of this cartridge in the headshell. I found that if it is placed at the 52mm location (tone arm end to needle), then the cartridge is properly aligned (an aligment protractor is included) when the cartridge is parallel to the sides of the headshell. If you don't know about the factory 52mm recommendation, then you can get into a lot of hassle trying to minimize the alignment tracking errors."
2,Shure M97xE Cartridge,I'm not an audiophile but I think this cartridge is not as good as expected. It is adequate for the price.
3,Shure Phono Cartridge,"I've arranged to ship through my local postal arrangement. However I was rejected initially because this item is classified as dangerous goods on air shipment due to the item description: ""Magnetic Cartridge"" as ""Magnet"" is banned onboard air planes. Remember to request alteration to the description by removing the word: ""Magnetic"" if possible."
2,"Mushy, pre-echo, distortion","It's just not worth the money no matter how you discount it. It is not even better than the cartridge that came with my AT-LP120-USB. The cartridge came with the AT-LP120-USB lacks a little on the bass. So I bought this Shure to replace it. But it evens out the dynamics and looses details. It takes all the excitement, dynamics out of the music. Among the worst, is the distortion at a high volume - it occurs all the time when listening to Marilyn Horne's high notes (opera, mezzo-soprano). AT440Mla is much more superior - produces a ""digital"" clear sound. At 65 bucks, it just doesn't do the job and is shelved. So not quite a bargain after all. Spend 100 or more and get one that's worthy of all your nice recordings."
3,Not for Technics SL1210 Mk5,"If you're the owner of a high mass tone arm like the one found on the Technics SL1200 line, please stay away from this cartridge. I wish I had done my reach a little more. I bought this cartridge and it doesn't sound that great on my turntable. Brightness in missing, sometimes the inner groove of the record (the sound on the left speaker) gets distorted. I'm now looking at a Audio Technica 120E or the Stanton 681 EEE.Also, this cartridge has been very difficult to get it aligned properly. I've had it for almost two weeks, and I'm still not 100% satisfied with the alignment"
4,Nice sound at a bargain price,I needed to replace the phono cartridge on my turntable that had been in storage for twenty years. I didn't want to spend a lot since my plan was to simply digitize my vinyl LP collection and then permanently retire the turntable and vinyl LPs. The installation of the M97xE was straightforward but the instructions made no reference to the alignment protractor thats folded up and hidden under the foam carrier inside the case. Place the protractor on top of a LP on the turntable platter with the spindle inserted into the hole in protractor. Check the cartridge alignment at the two locations printed on the protractor and your overhang and alignment are set. I had forgotten how great LPs sound ... I may have to reconsider retiring the turntable!
4,Best bet for under $200,"I can't spout audiophilic esoterica about how this compares to vintage cartidges and models costing thousands. And I can't say that listening to records with this cartidge changed my life, or even the way I hear music. But I can say that it's a big improvement over my old cartidge and stylus. It does feel a little heavy in the mid-range to me, but that's what EQs are for.I spent a day reading reviews and data, so hopefully I'll spare someone else that headache. If can spend more than $25 DO. This is big step up and it's an excellent value on Amazon. If you can afford to spend $200 and have a discerning ear, look into the Denon 103. I haven't heard it, but from every account I've read it's a phenomenal value for that mid-range price. If you want to spend more than that, what are you doing reading my review? You must know more about this stuff than me."
5,Great cartridge for the money,"As with other reviewers, I have also tried different catridges and the M97xE is hands down the best for the money. Great tracking and a warm natural sound. Highly recommended."
3,Not the best sound but good for a cheap cartridge,"Sounds like a $50 cartridge so I would not recommend paying much more. Tried it on my good system and then on my older one. My old cheapo Empire with aftermarket stylus sounded better and clearer (both for $20 on ebay). It does track well and requires good set up in the tonearm, but sound was disappointing when compared to other similar cartridges."
4,Shure M97xE phono cartridge,"This phono cartridge from Shure is sure to please many users. It is very stable even with a low tracking force of 1.2grs which helps preserving your cherished records. The sound quality coming out of it is amazingly clear and well balanced for the price. I am truly satisfied with my purchased and will probably won't change it for anything else (unless I upgrade my turntable and go for a high end cartdrige to go with). Recommended purchase for all vinyl freaks like me. Regards, Sam from France"
5,Audiophile Quality at fraction of cost,"This is being used on a Technics 1200 in a sterio system with a 180 W/Ch ATI Amp, Marchand X-Over, NAD pre-amp and Dynaudio Speakers.I previously had purchased the Audio Technica ATLP120 from Amazon and although a nice player for the money ($150) it lacked the sturdy and rugged construction I was looking for.To be honest, however, the Audio Technica comes with a very nice cartridge and the difference in sound quality is negligible.Bottom line. If you want a top quality audiophile grade cartridge for under $ 75 get this !"
5,Gold for my money,"Not much more that I can add than whats already been stated here. Out performs my previous Audio Technica cart by far. The difference was magical, and the price difference small. I love it!!!"
3,"Can be too ""laid back"" for some systems","I have all solid state gear, and even so, this cartridge sounded much too laid back and warm for my tastes to the point of being bland. I like a little more involvement in my music. I suspect it would sound even more dull with tube gear. I currently run the AT440MLa which has enough ""sizzle"" for me (without being overly bright).It's not a ""bad"" cartridge; some folks love them for the warm sound.Phono cartridges are inherently subjective so reviews don't really mean much. It's too bad somebody doesn't rent cartridges so a person could try out several. That's the only way to know."
2,Quality control issues!,"I bought this stylus to go on my brand-new Audio-Technica AT-LP120. Installation was easy, and for a day, it sounded very nice. But then, after about 5 total hours of use, the right channel went out, replaced by a faint, low hum. I double checked all my connections, un-installed it, re-installed it, and re-installed the original cartridge that the turnable shipped with, which worked fine. I can assure you that the stylus did not meet with any accidents, and nothing was hooked up wrong. This thing simply died on it's second day of use."
3,Same old Shure,"I was hoping that maybe Shure had updated and improved their audio cartridges. Well, they still have the same shortcomings they had since I bought my first one way back in 1979!I'm really surprised they have the nerve to call this an audiophile cartridge. Low output, lack of solid bass tone and a lack of a crisp clear high-end. It's kind of a lazy cartridge for lack of words.My 1980 Pickering XV15 625E outperforms it in every way. It has more low end punch and more extended high range. It also has higher output.All with a used needle too!I was a bit surprised to see that it was made in Mexico. Now I see why I got it for $63. No, I'm not mad. From here on I will never buy any more Shure prodicts. Let the buyer beware"
5,Excellent sounding cartridge,"This replaced the aging Audio Technica cartridge in my Technics SL-23.My setup now, for reference:Shure M97xE cartridgeTechnics SL-23 turntableSears LXI receiverAiwa bookshelf speakersI've been listening to:Radiohead - In RainbowsJapandroids - Celebration RockMatt & Kim - SidewalksI like the sound from this cartridge a lot. The brush is a nice feature, but does require cleaning out between records. That could just be my records, though. Installation and alignment were a bit tricky, but that can be chalked up to my own limited experience and general difficulty of dealing with small cables rather than a fault of this cartridge."
5,5 Stars For The Money,"This is my first Shure cart, and so far so good. To put things in perspective, my former cart was an Ortofon VMS 30 MK II. I loved the sound of the Ortofon, but didn't want to spend over $300 to replace it, and have it imported from Europe. I figured I would try to find a good cart under $100, and this one so far is great. It comes in a protective metal box that has foam inside to surround and protect the cart. It also includes a screwdriver, and needle brush.I've only played a couple of records so far, and they sounded good.I'm not to up on the technical jargon, but my ears were happy, and that's all that matters to me."
4,"Good cartridge, but low output, be careful","All the raves about this cart's sound quality are correct -- but be warned. It's not a good match for the Audio Technica ATLP120 Professional Turntable. This cart has a very low output, so low that the built-in preamp in the Audio Technica ATLP120 Professional Turntable will stop recognizing it between tracks, leaving gaps of pure silence as a song fades out. The standard line-level outputs, plugged into a separate preamp, are just fine. Just don't use this cart with the built-in preamp in the Audio Technica ATLP120 Professional Turntable. It will cause you nothing but headaches if you're planning to rip your vinyl."
1,Poor build quality,"I like Shure cartridges - I have owned a V15 Type V and an M95HE, but I would not recommend the M97xE due to its poor build quality. Mine arrived with the cantilever far out of alignment. This isn't an isolated problem: A quick search online revealed a test report of the M97xe at tnt-audio.com in which the reviewer reports the same problem with his sample. Amazon reviewer D. Timm wrote that his ""had a very crooked cantilever assembly,"" and D. Mitra had a tech look at his who told him ""the stylus is bent.""Mine also had two blobs of glue on the stylus assembly, presumably from sloppy work. Another reviewer here wrote of his M97xE, ""The molded body was lopsided."" I'd choose a different cartridge."
3,shure always,"I have been using shure products since my schooldaysI am now 66.Shure is great for cartridges! I have the V3, V5, M55e.M44,He111, M70b(2)M24H (2) white label,m 75ED catridges and they still work fine"
4,smooth and sedated,The sound quality is smooth and easy. You have to make sure you mount it appropriately with the correct vertical height. Use spacers if your unit's tonearm does not adjust. If you want something more explosive-dynamic look for something else. This one won't fatigue your ears.
5,Get one (or two)...NOW!,"Before you read this, read the other reviews that talk about this cartridge's fine sound quality, value, tracking and etc. I have nothing to add except that I agree that this is a marvelous product with no down-side.What I will add is that if you have a record collection and are at all concerned whether 10 years from now you'll be able to get a good cartridge lest you lose your music, act NOW. In fact, at this price, buy a couple of them. Soon enough this will go the way of carburetors and slide rules and become ""unobtanium"".Better to have your own ""new-old-stock"" unit in a drawer that you can roll out when your current cartridge dies, than to have to pay through the nose to some ebay scalper.My 2c.Neil"
5,No Better Cartridge Out There,"By far the best cartridge I've ever bought. I have a Technics SL-D303 turntable, and I always used the Audio-Technica AT70L cartridge. This cartridge picks up much higher and lower frequencies that I never even knew were there! The dust brush is a really amazing feature to have, as manually dusting vinyl can be a pain. I highly recommend this cartridge to any vinyl lover!"
2,Theres a reason newer reviews are not good on this cartridge,"Shure is having there phono cartridges made in Mexico these past few years and it shows. On the audio blog I frequent there have been complaints of misaligned stylus assemblys, poor finish and shoddy construction. One reviewer here said he saw a couple copper strands sticking out of the back of the cartridge. Shure has jumped on the band wagon of outsourcing and it shows in the quality of there products when will these companies realize cutting cost is also cutting there sales. I cannot recommend this cartridge anymore, it used to be a good value."
4,I like it!,"I like this cartridge. You probably cannot beat it for the price. I have mine on a Technics SL 1200 MKII with a $1K Origin Live tonearm and it sounds detailed with great dynamics and dimension. It tracks pretty well too. I listen to soul, jazz, and classical with the cart. My only gripe is that I wish the body wasn't so wide because it hits my Michell record clamp unless I grab the arm when it hits the run-out groove."
5,Review of SHURE M97xE Cartridge,"I've had this new cartridge installed for about a month, and have listened fairly often, with headphones and without. I listen to Jazz, older rock, and classical, but regardless the Shure M97xE seems neutral and therefore revealing of the quality of the recording. Often headphones tell you more than you want about this, but I found their use to be like a miscroscope into the music as well as soundstage and timber of the instruments, all of which were reproduced very convincingly by the cartridge. So, given the quality of the cartridge and price I paid, about 1/3 of the going retail in plces like Needledoctor (on line), it is quite a bargain."
5,What a stylus.,"I like turntables for the reason of sound creation, differentiation and manipulation. This is the reason you get cartridges over DVD/CD players. The sounds you can create and adjust instrumentation to are impressive. Creating a blend and harmony with the particular album designer that suits your tastes. For explicit and full bodied sound, this Shure M97xE is a winner on all levels.Superb sound design creates accurate and highly desireable listening. And for the price; Shure has outdone itself with this. Takes the design simplicity with newer, high quality engineering available to affordable heights you'll never want to come down from. Play loud or soft; she never pushes you away, but keeps you coming back for more. For this price, this quality; Shure is back on the top of the competition with a winner!Go for it. You won't be sorry with it added to your cartridge and stylus collection. She doesnt' compete: She compliments."
5,Its for Shure,"Bought this for use with my record collection, it works very well. Hard to find Record Player parts now days."
4,Good but not great,I think my old Audio Technica AT96E delivered better quality sound. It just got so out of date that I couldn't find a new stylus.
2,"Played reasonably well, but ...","... but one day the body of the cartridge (shown in dark gray in the pic) decided that it would fall off the aluminum mountain bracket (silvery-gray). I tried gluing it back, but could align accurately enough.This happened maybe 100 hours into its life. The cartridge was never dropped or handled improperly. I have had a dozen different types of cartridges, but nothing like this had happened before or has happened since."
3,Nice playback,"Shure has always done it right....well worth the investment, especially for a second cartridge! I love the mid range detail."
4,Good enough,It's been a long time since I installed a cartridge but I always trusted the Shure brand. I found an vintage Marantz turntable (sans cartridge) and really wanted to drag out all my old 60s-70's albums. I'm not really into specs so I can't tell you anything other than it works well and it was worth the effort to hear that great vinyl tone. Great simple product for simple needs.
5,Use with My USB Turntable,"I use this item with my Audio Technica ATLP120 USB turntable and have ripped many a record to .wav file with it. I think it accurately transmits the recording quality of the original record and I have no complaints about it (even the leading brush is a nice touch and I can see it collect particles). Just make sure that your turntable's arm is counter-weighted properly, so that the needle doesn't dig in or touch too lightly."
5,A fantastic cartridge at an amazing price!,"Buy one of these before it's too late, a fantastic improvement on the installed cartridge on my Dual CS503. Really detailed with low vinyl hiss and great tracking partnered with Shure warmth. You'll be discovering your record collection all over again.Excellent !"
3,SHURE quality isn't what it used to be,"I will say the M97xE sounds fine for a $50 - $60 cartridge, it just isn't built as precisely and solidly as cartridges I purchased 20 years ago -- Stanton, Pickering, and, yes, SHURE. If I'd paid full price for the M97xE I would have returned it to Amazon for a refund.Fortunately, the parts of the M97xE that are not built precisely were not the parts that impact its setup and sound. The molded body was lopsided, with some measurements being off by as much as 1/16 of an inch. A cartridge is supposed to be a piece of precision equipment, so is it unreasonable to expect the entire cartridge to be symetrical?Fortunately, the stylus mount portion of the body was aligned so I was able to mount the cartridge in the headshell with no problems.I'll just have to learn to not look at it too carefully because it still looks lopsided.Again, the sound quality of the M97xE is impressive, the cartridge just looks cheap and shoddy."
2,It's a sub-$60 cartridge in all ways,"Not much in the way of dynamics here - very dull sounding, and brittle on the high end (even after 100+ hours of break-in). After a very short period of time the black paint chipped off the body of the cartridge - presumably ending up in the grooves of my records, which has caused white-hot hatred for this junk, and has made me question my ...uh...""frugal"" (cheap) nature. Penny-wise and pound foolish, ta drop some B. Frank. .I'm returning it to Shure for warranty service, and then selling the new replacement on Ebay.I've switched back to my ancient (25 year-old) Shure M95ED (after replacing the broken stylus with a generic replacement) and am loving my records again.Stay clear of the M97xE if you value your records and your time listening.If I could spend only $60 on a cartridge, I think I'd try the Grado Black first."
1,Needle Broke,I used this cartridge for about 10 hours of playing time before the needle fell off. Sound quality was just okay. Can't recommend due to the poor build quality of the stylus.
5,Wonderful read,Edith Skom just keeps them coming. This is a wonderfully told tale that is difficult to put down.
4,interesting CD,"It's a very neat format of music. It has good listening quality on my stereo or my PC. I'mlooking for the same type of music from this CD, right now I don't have any other recomendations-anybody out there let me know what U think and what other CD's like this one I can find."
4,Super Skinny Paul Mitchell,"Great product for my naturally curly, very thick hair. Lessens drying time exponentially. Works well for me; works perfectly with a professional stylist."
4,Great for beginners,"Great stuff for the amateur. I learned how to throw an Anhyser from this book, which has helped my game immensely. The videos I have watched are not as detailed in the description of method. Plus I can refer back easily with the book. I pack it with me to the coarse."
5,excellent,"Here is a really easy to read book on disc golf, loaded with information on how to get started and to improve your game. I found it most helpful as I am a beginner at the age of 70. It is good for all ages."
5,Learn To Enjoy Golf,This book is very interesting for anyone into the sport of golf. Very good reading.
1,expensive but little quality,I bought my children long john pj's for Christmas. I could not find a xxs for one child except from this site. I received them and the buttons fell off the first wearing and if you touch any threads it would unravel out. My other two children pj's were from a different site and half the price. They still look brand new. I would not recommend this company.
3,Not bad for the money,"We wanted something cheap and fast for a Christmas card photo. These are thin, but were all we needed, and our kids have adopted them as their favourite pyjamas. We had read about buttons coming off, but after several weeks, everything is still intact. These aren't LL Bean, but they're not bad."
2,sleepers,"I loved the fact that they were a solid color and had the drop back bottom but the back it only closes with one button that doesn't stay buttoned, not attractive."
4,Matches perfectly!,This light switch cover matches their bedding set perfectly! We purchased this for our first baby's room since we're doing a frog theme. My only issue is since it's so thick there's not much room for the actual light switch to stick out to operate it smoothly.
1,Looks Great in the picture,"I ordered this table, and never heard from the vendor again!To say the least I never got the table.I wish Amazon would remove deadbeat VENDORS from their site."
4,"Good player, but not perfect.","I have owned this player for several months, and use it quite a lot. I use rechargable Nickle Metal Hydride batteries, listen to MP3 files on a CD-RW disc.Pros:Long battery lifeCD-RW MP3 playbackDigital Controls, including volumeHas never skippedText DisplayAdjustable Bass levelsButtons to skip foldersRandom PlayCons:Hard to use controls if you can't see them (flat buttons)Can't get remote for US model (and no backlit display)Can't fast forward through part of MP3 song like a WAVNo belt clip-only wrist strapOverall, it's been a good player."
5,"OH MY GOD, WHAT A CD PLAYER!!!!","I bought this CD walkman before the summer of 2002. AND Oh my god, the player is sssooo good. The sound quality is AMAZING!!! Like a stereo going in your head. The player is sssooo strong. I drop maybe 100 times and it played like new. Though I droped it a lot, NO CRACK!!! I never used the MP3 but I think it could have been cool. It was sssoooo easy to use, I never even read the instruction book. ALSO, with the batteries, you can use the player for like a month. LAST, the style looks AWESOME!!!! I recently lost it and was soo bumed out. But I bought a newer version which almost looks exactly like it but better. The new CD player that I bought is Sony D-NE710 ATRAC3/MP3 CD Walkman Portable Disc Player."
1,Other Leap Pad books are better,"We're big fans of the Leap Pad, and have several books that we LOVE (don't miss ""Hit It Maestro."") Our four-year-old bored with this one very quickly, and hasn't played with it again. The book only covers pennies, dimes, and nickels -- why no quarters? The games are few and very redundant. If your child knows anything at all about coins, this book would be a waste of money. However, it might make a useful introduction for very small children (3 or 4)."
3,Didn't help her learn about money,"I got this for my 4-yr old daughter because I thought it might help her learn about coins, which she's had a hard time with. I was disappointed that it didn't do quarters as well. Plus, it doesn't really help teach about coins. It shows them, but never explains that 5 pennies equal a nickel, 10 pennies equal a dime, etc. Also, every page has the exact number of nickels, dimes, and pennies that are needed to make 10 cents, so the child never has to figure it out for themselves -- they just click on each coin on the page. She didn't learn anything at all from this book, nor is it one she plays with very often. When she does, she only plays the games (which are kind of fun), but there is not much educational value"
3,monster money,"I just love leap frog's book's, but I thought this one could have taught all the coins instead off just Pennies,Dimes and Nickles.They could have done each page a diffrent price for the pets?"
5,The Meaning of Fear,This episode portrays Captain Janeway in a commanding yet compassionate role. She will not leave three individuals who have been in stasis for years alone at the mercy of FEAR. The character of FEAR is vividly portrayed by Michael McKeon. No one will forget the circus like atmosphere he creates or how chilling his portrayal of that emotion. It is an episode that I have seen over and over again. I heartily recommend it.
5,Excellent! One of the best episodes!,"This episode proves that Star Trek is not just for sci-fi fans. Its a completely unique idea, visually entertaining, and an attention grabber! I definitly think you see this episode!"
2,CD-R Users Stay Away,"I own this and another Sony CD player and both DO NOT LIKE CD-R discs. Does not matter what disc brand, what burner, what program, whatever. Sony products are absolutely idiotic when it comes to reading CD-R music discs. If it doesnt bother you that half the time the reader doesnt recognise the existence of the disc or if it does, skips several times through it like it is lost in some wilderness trying to find its way, then go ahead and play CD-Rs on Sony products. Not recommended for the rest of us that want our music to play and play consistently. Other than this, I have no real problem with Sonys. Sound quality is decent for the money. Just throw away all your CD-R discs if you buy a Sony CD player."
5,WOW!!!,loved this book. was very interesting. couldn't put it down at all until i finished it. It was completely awesome.
4,Poignant,"I am in ninth grade and I am in the AP English course. We were asked to read The Skin I'm In and write in a journal about what we were reading. The Skin I'm In was a very poignant book displaying not only the prejudices and setbacks that blacks face in society, but the overall prejudices that social outcasts face in society. I was especially moved by the relationship that developed between Miss Saunders and Maleeka. Maleeka hated Miss Saunders at first, but then grew to admire and respect her. If the book would have gone on a little further, I am certain that Miss Saunders would have ended up being Maleeka's mentor and encouragement."
4,Powerful influence,"The character of Maleeka, in this book, is very influental, i believe. In the story this young girl Maleeka has to tolerate the name calling and put downs becuse of her very dark skin. Through the book, Maleeka suffered through various degrees of low self esteem; for instance, she was trying to fit in, she was getting put down, she tried to change her physical appearance, which helped her for a moment or two, but then she was put down again, and again, until she was left with mixed emotions. She didnt know whether to be scared or not, if she could stand up for herself, if maybe there was a way out and if maybe there really was a solution. Indeed there was a solution, and she found it when she finally discovered who she was. She stood up for herself, didnt let the main opposition act superior to her; she told her who she was--she was Maleeka, intelligent, independent, strong,yes black and beautiful. :) she liked who she was"
5,The Best Book On Earth,"Maleeka Madson is an inner city student trying to fit in with the people around here, but with dark compilation and rags for clothes, it is very hard. Here self-esteem is affected everyday because of this verbal humiliation. Until here teacher helps here with self-esteem issues from here past experiences. In that teacher is Miss Saunders. Miss Saunders tackles Maleeka's problems by letting her know she had the same issues with teasing about her skin problem. Miss Saunders teaches here how to love herself, which many teenagers don't do, because there made-fun-of. The explanation form Miss Saunders is what makes book so good, mentors actually mentoring kids on real life issues, instead of putting the down. From my understanding of The Skin I'm In, I will give it five stars, five being the best for Sharon G. Flake's novel."
5,A Good Book,The Skin Im In is a very good book. It relates to young girls these days because most teenagers will catch up with the wrong crowds sometime during their teen years.In this book Maleeka Madison caught up with the wrong crowd just to get more friends and to be populsr once in her life. The only place that got her was in a lot of trouble and had to find new friends. With the help her teacher she finds her way through life and found out what kinds of friends she wants.
3,Character For Sale,"Maleeka as a character,is worth four dollars. Maleeka cost four dollars because of her attitude. Maleekas attitude cost two dollars and fifty cents because attitude turned out to be positive and negative,throughout the book.The price of Maleekas self-confidence cost fifty cents because she lets people bring her down when she is excited.The rest of the money illustrates how much maleekas personality cost maleeka's personality cost fifty cents because she doesen't like herself.She likes to be like other people.You should read this book The Skin I'm In to find out more about maleeka's life."
2,Not worth the read,"The Skin I'm In, by Sharon G. Flake was an okay book. The book was very descriptive, yet didn't have much of a theme to it. I felt compelled to read the book as it was very realistic and descriptive, but I don't think I'd recommend the book to anyone. I also feel the book dealt with older than described incidents during the book."
3,JuLiE 's BoOk ReViEw ~,"¡The Skin I'm in¡ is a pretty realistic novel that readers will find very easy to read as it is written in a very relaxed and informal way. I haven¡t read any other novels written that way. This is a book I recommend to people from age 10 and above. The story is very realistic, its plot is a story that could happen to anybody in today¡s world. It is about an African American female teenager, Maleeka, and her skin color complexion. As a result, Maleeka has a very low self-esteem and her classmates and ¡friends¡ strongly take advantage of her. But suddenly, Miss Saunders, with skin problems as well, comes into her life and serves as a mirror to Maleeka¡s struggle. I honestly enjoyed this novel for its realistic plot. However, I think it could have been written in a more appropriate manner, not in such a ghetto talk, as it was written. But I still recommend this book to young teenagers."
3,Necessary Read,"Maleeka Madison didn't always feel bad about herself. It was the taunting and teasing of her peers that caused her to feel like she was nothing because she had dark skin. Besides making fun of her complexion they teased her about her hair and her clothes and they even picked on her because the teachers liked her and because she got good grades. It seemed like there was nothing she could do to be accepted.Then one day Maleeka created a fictional character for an English assignment. Eventually, this made up slave girl helps Maleeka find the courage to speak up for herself, demand respect and accept the skin she's in.This story shows just how much some young people have to deal with and how cruel other young people can be. The message Flake makes very clear: Self acceptance is much more important than social acceptance."
3,The Skin I'm In,this story is about this girl who also was getting bulliyed around and who just want to be like everyone else she hates that her mom makes her clothes and she hates how the fite her big and there wobbly on her. so she goes and cuts her hair and curls it to try to make her self look better it did not make a diffrence from before she wore her friends hat for the rest of the day she starts handing around with all the wrong people she starts being rude and disrespectful so one day when she came to class she was late she started falling behind in school and the teacher got her suspended so when she got home her mom was mad at her
5,An Amazing Book,"The skin I'm in is about a dark skinned gil named Maleeka Madison.She is like the main character of the whole book.Before you read the book I just can tell you that everything dosn't go her way.Maleeka has her best friends Charlese and the two twins Raise and Raina.Maleeka is always very relying to Charlese.Charlese has to bing her clothes everyday because Maleeka is ashamed of the clothes her mother makes for her and because shes afraid of what others will think of her at school.Maleeka also has a love place in her heart for a boy named Caleb.Caleb and Maleeka arn't together in the beggining of the book but towards the end their relationship starts to get deeper,deeper,and deeper.There are many surprises in this book and thats why I love it so much.I would read this book over and over again.If you are thinking about reading this you shoould because its filled with surprises and amazing things."
4,The Skin I'm In Review,"How would you like to read a book who goes to a ghetto school and has a lot of obstacles that she has to overcome like fights and peer pressure? There is this mean girl named Charlese. She tries to pressure Maleeka into doing bad things. Maleeka's dad is dead and her mom needed something to keep her occupied. Maleeka has a very poor family so they can't have a lot of extra things. She sews Maleeka's clothes. Maleeka doesn't like the clothes so she changes into clothes that Charlese gives her, and in return, Maleeka has to do Charlese's homework. I really liked this book because it is full of action and I think you will to if you like a lot of action."
5,Skin I'm In,"Fabulous first person book about a middle school girl who is bullied for her dark skin color and homemade clothes. Her relationship with a new teacher, who has her own appearance insecurities, leads to self discovery. Sharon Flake writes with such an authentic voice as she channels her middle school heroine Maleeka. Highly recommended."
5,aber s.,When I first read ''The Skin Im In''.I was very glad to have picked it up.It made me feel like reading plenty more books.This book is telling about a teenage girl going through some things and that made me relate to the character.Whenever I can relate to a character in a book I can visualize easier.Whenever you visualize you can understand the story better than when you are just yelling out words.
2,Descriptive and vivid but no theme...,"The Skin I'm In, by Sharon G. Flake is an okay read. The book is very descriptive including vivid details that help the reader be interested, yet it had no theme. The only reason I kept reading was because the awesome descriptions but I definitely do not think it is a ""must-read."" I also would not recommend this book. The reader should be atleast 10+ as it deals with teen issues."
3,The Skin I'm In,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It isn't the type of book to keep you reading, but it has a cute story line. I felt really bad for the girl when I was reading it. I couldn't believe that she was teased because of her race, when the people teasing her, were the same race as her. It didn't make much sense to me.It makes you realize that you can make friends with people, you never thought you would be a possiblity. It makes you realize that we all have problems, but we need to look for the good in people, and their originality."
5,Do you have low self confindace?,"The story is about one girl named Maleeka Madison who is poor. Her mother have to make her clothes,so kids pick on her. Then some girls named Charlese,Juju,and Rania let her in thrir group. Charlese brings her clothes if Maleeka follow her oders. Next Miss Sanders come in their lives.She teaches her students don't worry if you are ugly or cute.Also she teaches if you show that you have confindance in your self other people will believe it too.Becaue Miss Sanders had a huge birth mark on her forehead."
3,ReAd ThIs!,"In the story The Skin I'm In there is a girl named Maleeka. She is a black girl who is in 7th grade and is very tall and smart for her age. She gets made fun of at school because of the way she looks. They have a new teacher at her school. Her name is Mrs. Saunders. The kids and teachers dont really like her. The kids think she has a funny face, because when she was born her face came out that way. In the book Maleeka and Mrs. Saunders became friends. I did like this book because it tells people about how you shouldn't make fun of people because they are smart or they look weird. You should be nice to every one and this book tells you that. They tell you about how maybe some one els feels when they get made fun of."
5,An Exciting Book,Maleeka is experiencing difficulties at school and in other aspects of her life due to the color of her skin. She deals with peer pressure and bullies at school. This is an excellent book and everyone should have the joy of reading this exciting book.
5,what i like and do not like about The skin im in,I do not like the fact that Maleeka is being someone she is not. How she hangs with Char and the twins and smoke and gets in trouble. What I do like about Maleeka is that she got a haircut. And when she was about to fight charlese she was talking bad like she could beat her up.
3,Not the best book I have read,Same old story nothing new to add to what is already written by other author's. We all live in our skin and adjust to it.
3,"Who Me, a Book Critic?",This book isn't what you expect. It's kind of good but it doesn't have alot of action. It's kind of a straight line.The only part I liked about this book is when the boy who betrayed her was havng an conversation with her in detention.I would recommend this book to older kids because there's a disturbing part in it.
5,The Skin I'm In,"The book The Skin I'm In is a very sincere and well-written novel. My favorite chapter from this book would have to be chapter 31. In this chapter Maleeka, the main character, finally learns to trust someone so she doesn't feel alone anymore. Maleeka also finds out that sometimes it's not always right to cover up for people, espeacilly in a situation like the one that she is in. The age group I think this book would be appropriate for would be teenagers of about 12 and over. I think this age group is appropriate because in this boook it relates to a lot of people, who in this stage of life, are experiencing peer-pressure. This book brings out a lot of feelings toward a certain topic.I like the novel I have read because of the fact that it just brought out so many feelings and made me realize how many different people there are in the world, their different point of veiw, and their approach."
3,"Great book, not just for youngsters",Ms. Flake did a fine job of detailing the life of young black adolescents. Her writing is very true to life. I noticed the book at my son's school. I'm glad that it was a required read for the middle schoolers. We need more stories about our lives.
4,the skin im in,iliked this book because ti relates to me life i really like the part were calibe was talking to her in detention and the teacher told them to separate and they didnt i alsoliked the part wereshe says at the end were if nobody liked her for her skin color that thats the skin i am in. it was a realy good book but i gave it 4 stars because some of the parts i didnt under stand like when she put the money on fire and were she kept being char's friend when she was treated like adog
1,Newest album of originals a disappointment for McLean fans,"Anyone who, like me, treasures DonMcLean's earlier albums will be disappointed with this one. The songs here range from the humdrum title track to the cutesy Little Cowboy, an indulgent ditty from a songwriter who seems to have lost all his edge. McLean seems to have forgotten how to write poetry - lyrically this album borders too often on the trite and musically it is devoid of originality."
4,Eloquently disturbing,"Gritty stories of lives on the fringe, told with deceptively sparse eloquence. I enjoyed every story and will anxiously await Davidson's next book. I expect great things to come!"
4,a Canadian Palaniuk,"A fantastic collection of edgy, modern, and taut short stories. The full existential range of feelings are present here: you'll feel a drop and your stomach and then laugh out of humor, empathy, or derision. This book is like a punch in the stomach and a hard look in the mirror, sometimes it's what you need."
5,A recommendation for any fiction lending library strong in modern literary achievement.,"Fighting is a major theme in Craig Davidson's short stories, which pack the punch of underworld fiction writing at its best. Here are visions of broken beings who struggling for meaning in life - shocking, eye-opening stories which aren't for the meek or leisure reader seeking light-hearted plots. Davidson's settings are fictional and his characters are searching out humanity in the midst of violence: perhaps this is what makes RUST AND BONE a compelling mirror image of modern times - and a recommendation for any fiction lending library strong in modern literary achievement.Diane C.

3,A low cost experiment,"I purchased this cartridge to see if a ""P"" type generic would fit into A linear tracking arm on A Technics turntable. The original MC cart by Technics had a broken stylus and was no longer available for replacement. The installation was simple and with a minor force adjustment, worked fine. I did not expect a low cost MM to match performance with original MC but it is satisfactory for the price."
2,"Does the job, not much else...","Yes, this cartratige works, but if you can, shell out for a better one. There was significant background hum at higher volumes and the clarity of sound produced is only average. Buy it if you're on hard times, but keep shopping if you're not. Reasonable to install, did not encounter product defects, it's just too low-end for an audio enthusiast."
3,It gets the job done,It's not top of the line needle but its good for what it is.Great for casual listening. Not for serious Audiophiles.
3,Not sure,Was difficult to install so ant back. It might of been my record player and not the product but shure normally is good products
4,Great Cartridge,I bought this for a friend for Christmas and she was very pleased with it. The sound was clear and surprisingly good for the price. The only problem we had was with installing it. It took us about an hour. But if you're ok with small screws then you'll be fine.
4,Cartridge and needle evaluation: Very Good+,This cartridge fit to tonearm perfectly and performs well with absolutely no problems. Seems to be at least as good as the original cartridge equipped by manufacturer.
2,Unspectacular,"I am not a musical snob or an audiophile, but I greatly enjoy music, especially classic rock. I purchased this cartridge to replace the factory-supplied model on my Technics turntable, which had become worn with play. However, the sound quality of this Shure model proved to be disappointing- I could actually hear shortcomings in bass and treble response, and I noticed a general lack of crispness. Seeking a better model, I contacted Shure, and was further disappointed to find out they no longer make a mid-priced (under $100), or even a higher-priced, P-mount cartridge; this $27.00 model is it, and it really sounds like the price it's worth. If I were you, I would look at other brands, and in a somewhat higher price range, as ultimately the sound will ""echo"" the price you pay."
4,Great For a Low End Magnetic,"It is all I wanted. I replace the cartridges regularly on a five year of so basis. As time has gone on, my usage of the Sony TT has diminished considerably; consequently replacement of the cartridge (stylus) extends further into the future. Hand made this is not. Does it even stack up to Audio Technica???...not quite...but....if all you do is listen to the occasional record before they all succumb to vinyl rot, you would be hard pressed to put this unit down; unless of course you are made of money and like handmade everything!!Buy it and enjoy. It worked right out of the box. No extended warranty is needed; and when you are ready to get rid of it you may not find anymore such things available. Enjoy.AFG"
1,Worst Printer I Ever Owned,"This printer is absolutely horrible. I have had to replace two print cartridges and a transfer roller and now have spent almost as much as the original printer price - and it still doesn't work! These items are ""consumables"" according to Panasonic, and so are only covered for 90 days. With the light duty cycle I have, these parts fail after 90 days but probably only after 100 or so pages. The manual says they are good for 13,000 pages and 100,000 for the roller, but I have only printed 2500 pages over the lifetime of the printer.Facing yet more cartridge replacements, I am going to get a new printer and junk this one. Shame on Panasonic for OEM'ing this piece of crap and not backing it up to their customers!"
1,The radio broke putting in the battery,"I opened up the radio to put the battery in and the battery cover snapped off. Then, when I used electrical tape to hold it back together it still didn't work. Yeah it was cheap but I got the same result as if I went to a website, ordered an empty box, got it in two days (free shipping because I'm prime), threw out the box, tore up a couple of twenties and threw them in the garbage.My search for a decent portable radio continues while I miss some decent local sports.Bummer."
1,Run away,"This product is terrible. I cannot get the thing to stay on a station, it jumps all over the place. For some reason the FM doesn't work at all and it is built really cheap. I expected alot more for my Thirty bucks."
1,A disappointment,"First, it is a great size. After that things begin to decline. The reception for both am and fm is poor. I tried the radio under a variety of conditions and never got a clear signal. I'm afraid I can't recommend this. It's bad enough that I'm ordering another radio."
5,Vintage Willimon,"This book offers a readable summary of the narrative style interpretation of the Scriptures. For those unfamiliar with the works of Willimon / Hauerwas, this book could be a helpful introduction. It presents the Bible as the church's book, not the book of liberal academia or conservative individuals. As the church's book, the Bible has the power to call forth the kind of people it describes in its stories. This book contains a fresh look at scripture interpretation and performance written with laity in mind, but also helpful for clergy."
2,pureology,"I love the way the product worked, but it stunk so bad I couldnt use it anymore. I wrote the company and the only thing they did was give me a long process to return it. It was bought on a birthday gift card and I dont have the money to return it."
4,"""Tell me why can't it be true...""","""I don't want to be shyCan't stand it anymoreI just want to say `Hi'To the one I loveCherry blossom girl""Sweet innocence and a sense of shyness permeate this beautiful song about romantic dreams and tentative longings. The lyrics and creative playfulness are enhanced by an evocative voice flowing like a river trying to reach the sea.There are four versions to enjoy, although the first is my personal favorite. The last version is purely instrumental and emphasizes the haunting elements of flute. Hope Sandoval's version is breathy and dreamy with more variety in the lyrics.The mix version doesn't seem to exemplify the innocence I love in the song and seems to muddy up the image of the sweet dreamy mood with much more intense and sensual beats.""I'll never love againCan I say that to youWill you run awayIf I try to be trueCherry blossom girl""~The Rebecca Review"
5,Charming video,Bought this for my 6 year old Grandson. He loved it! He wanted to watch it over again right away. Guess I'll be getting him more of Dino Dan
3,Good if you don't have Nick Jr,"I agree with another reviewer--- If you DON'T have Nick Jr and your child hasn't already seen all of the episodes a million times, this is a good DVD. But this has been my son's favorite show since it came out, so he already knew all but one episode. We were both pretty disappointed. They should have a list of what's on the dvd... I assumed it was new stuff."
5,Dino Dan Video,"Everything went great... We recieved our Videos brand new wrapped in their package, great price, we are very very satisfied."
4,The girls enjoyed it,"The episodes are short, which makes this a great DVD for younger kids with shorter attention spans. However, since there are multiple episodes, they hold older children's attention for longer periods of time. And since the shows are family-oriented, it makes for a great family movie night. As a parent, the episodes didn't hold my attention specifically, but it was great to be able to watch the DVD with both of my children and not be concerned about bad language, violence, or inappropriate situations. My daughters liked it so well that they watched it several times before we returned the DVD, and 3 neighborhood children ended up watching it with us as well.Reviewed for Arms of a Sister blog."
4,Hope is Near,"This has been a long awaited surprise for many Mazzy Star fans. I would have to say that for the Mazzy/Hope fans this album delivers whirlwinds of melancholic melodies (perfect for the true stargazer). But for those not exposed to any other Mazzy Music besides ""So Tonight that I Might See"" should not expect the upbeat enthusiasm of ""Fade into You.""The opening track brings back bits of guitar and bass traces from ""Disappear"" by Mazzy's last album ""Among my Swan,"" however, there is a much more different tone with very strong ""calming affects."" This album contains heavily dreamlike vibraphones that reverberate between Hope's lush and childlike vocals. There is even a piano based track that is so organic that you can hear the clicking of what seems to be the foot pedals of the piano. The vocals are much more apparent and clearer in Hope's attempt at a solo career, and the distant Reverb is still there but cut down a bit. This is a must and the full-length album awaits us with open arms."
3,good solid hope,pity those EPs are so short - but then again they would not be EPs ?!if you get a copy cheap enough buy it but do not pay a fortune for it unless you are a hardcore collector
1,Make up artist,Not my favorite I had the last one for about 6 mnths before it died .. In a year I have gone through three so it's pricy when you need three a year they break contently.. I would not recommend unless you buy a back up they do not last long at all..
3,Orangeless in Texas,"I ordered this product as a gift but was surprised to receive it in black rather than UT burnt orange. When I asked the seller about it, I was told that they never had it in orange and that Amazon lumps all sellers together and only allows one picture. Although it appears to be nice enough, the lunch box itself is on the small side but will hold a sandwich, small snack and 12 oz drink. Still, I am disappointed that I received something I did not order. It might be okay if one of UT's school colors was black but that's not the case."
1,"economic ""bad"" ?","The closer I read this book, the less I understand. It is written in a very labrynthine and overly-detailed style, jumping between examples and terminology.It does a very poor job of giving an overview of the theories. This book over-complicates even the simplest concepts of economics, most likely to be in compliance with the 14% new material rule for textbook editions. It presumes a knowledge of algebra and eventually some calculus, but spends a paragraph explaining the derivation of circumfrence, and how Pi is roughly equivalent to 3.14, in my favorite example of the authors bogging down in petty details.If you are assigned this book in class, I highly recommend changing to a different class, or hoping that the prof (as is my case) gives clear lectures and uses the book to provide some further depth, but doesn't overly engage in using or testing from it."
4,Keeper,"Definite Keeper. This was a darn good book. It keeps you wondering what you would do if, in some strange twist of fate you were thrown into such an inexplicable situation. You find yourself checking your rear view mirror more often, and being much more aware of those around you. Such paranoia. It will shake, rattle and roll you; I couldn't put it down. I pulled an all nighter with this one. It makes you lose hope in humanity, and by the end you regain hope, though you are a bit shaky. Very moving."
4,So-So!,"This novel focuses on the aftermath of a car-crash disaster, a crash that has apparently killed one of America's favorite feminists and has ravaged the soul of San Diego Psychologist Professor Fred Porter. A call to his friend, a Judge, wrenches his life around when he discovers what he's unearthed. Incredible events follow.The secret behind the mayhem, which is delivered at breakneck speed, concerns a scientific breakthrough into mystical neuroscience regarding Munyemesha presents with sour-sweet analysis. But if his science his suspicious, his soapboxing is another story---a merciless rant against moral turpitude---and his prose is ripe to the point of decay. Driven by morality, this will sell good...and that will be the end!"
4,Interesting insights on the behind-the -scenes happenings.,"I feel that Buddy could have gone more indepth on several occasions. That is why I rate this book a ""4"" star. Overall, the book is very good in that Buddy shares a lot of the frustrations of the happenings behind the scenes. Tells of his start in show business with his sister, to his alergic reaction to the costume of the Tin Man in ""The Wizard of Oz"", to his role in the Beverly Hillbillies, and beyond. Very interesting reading."
1,Evitar este libro,"Atención, ésta no es la hermosa selección de Menéndez y Pelayo, sino otra antología del mismo nombre, por un tal Cuenca, que tiene un gusto bastante particular por aburridos autores españoles tardíos del siglo de lata, y por poesías más bien mediocres de poetas consagrados.Le doy 1 punto porque alguna que otra poesía zafa, pero la muy mayoría no vale el papel en el que están escritas."
