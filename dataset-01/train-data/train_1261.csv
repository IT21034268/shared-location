3,No shipping discount on multiple bottles,"I don't appreciate this seller's $3 per bottle shipping rate when I want to be a large quantity customer, but the pills seem to be fine."
2,Stylish but cumbersome,"This teakettle is stylish, easy to fill and clean, reasonably priced, and whistles loudly - but only someone with a large hand can safely pour the entire contents of the kettle one-handed. The trigger, which opens the spring-loaded whistle cap, requires a second hand to hold it open while pouring more than a cup or two. After struggling with this kettle for several weeks, I decided that the safety factor was too important to ignore and bought a new kettle with a flip-top whistle cap which stays open while I pour one-handed."
3,OK Kettle,"For the price of about $12 I received very good value. My biggest complaint is it is hard to fill. I am suspect about the longevity of the spring loaded spout-opening mechanism, but that is yet to be seen. It does smudge easily and since I keep mine on the stove it must be washed after each usage, which I'm not crazy about. Again, it's easy to find fault. All in all the kettle is definately worth the low price."
2,Get Farberware 'Tiburon' instead,"Farberware 'Sonoma' has two bad design features: 1) the spout lid does not lock in the open position so you can't turn off the whistle, and 2) the spout lid does not open widely enough to let you fill the kettle through the spout - you have to remove the cover to do it, thus steaming the hand you're holding the handle with."
2,too hot to handle,we don't like this tea kettle. the handle gets too hot and requires a pot holder. we do have a gas range.
5,Premium product at acceptable price,"I'm an international students doing my graduate courseworks in New York. I have a problem about DVD zoning because most of my favorite movies are from Asia with the different zones with US.I did search many alternatives which are more expensive than this product (i.e Sony with starting price at one hundred something). Buying this product gives me a big surprise! Firstly, the seller is really great. I got the product very fast in all good conditions. The product is easy to set up and keeps what you set up into its memory. So, you don't have to be bothered by the several setup process. Picture and sounds are great for modest users. But for the high-end settings like an expensive home theater or flat screen tv, I have no comments.Thanks to the reviews posted in this website that helps me make my decision to buy easily."
5,Does the job and looks good.,"So far so good. Small and very thin unit does the job. I heard complaints about flimsy tray, but I don't see what the issue is. Everything works fine, even with DVD-R discs."
3,Not fancy but does the job,Just needed a player to view Region 2 DVD's and this one does the trick. Very basic features but gets the job done.
3,I really wanted to love this book...,"...it is such a great premise, and the author seems so thoughtful! However, it just isn't useful for our family. We've already discussed the rules covered here (except for some of the school-related ones, since we're homeschooling)with our 6-year-old son in greater detail than is found here. Two paragraphs of advice is not going to prepare my son to attend a wedding, for example.Maybe as my son gets older, we'll find that he would appreciate hearing this advice from another child rather than from his parents. If that happens, I'll buy the book again (I'm returning it now).This would be a great book to have in a support group lending library for a child to peruse, but it just isn't useful enough for our particular situation to keep on our shelf. I hope Ms. Myles writes a book on living on one's own when she's older--by the time my son is ready to do that, I imagine he would greatly prefer to follow a peer's advice than his mother's!"
2,Not helpful,"There was little in here to help the high functioning kids. Much of the the advice was not detailed enough for an Aspie and above the head of many. It was a nice effort, but I did not find it worth the price."
5,seal puller.,This is a handy lillt puller that can get into a tight place to remove seals. I received it in a timely manner and would buy it again.
4,"A ""Propulsive"" Performance","As with his recording of Mahler's 5th Symphony of that same year, I was impressed with the virtuosity of the Chicago Symphony. Just because it clocked in at 77 minutes, I did not consider it ""hard-driven.""I loved the Decca sound."
1,Cabinets SOOOOO frustrating!,"I agree with the above reviewer. I have spent hours changing the cabinets in the area where you can edit them, only to find after many, many hours trying to figure out what ""I"" did, still could not find them. Don't waste your time."
1,Stick with version 3.0,I have version 3.0 that is about 4 years old. It has more features than the 5.0 when it comes to bath fixtures and doors. this purchase has been a waste of money. The Company's description of the new version was misleading. I will not purchase any more products from them.
1,Waste of money and time.....,"I agree with every review I have read about this product, Broderbund 3D Home Architect 5. I too have spent hours trying to figure out how to drop cabinets into a structure. I could find them in the cataloges, and followed the instructions closely but to no good. I have even contacted Broderbund for help and they referred me to another company that never responded to my e-mail. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT, IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. ZERO STARS ALL AROUND. - TAD"
1,Disappointing,"Even though the package states that it includes ""cabinets"", it doesn't. You can't ""drop in"" any of the available sinks and stoves because there is nothing to drop them into. I installed it twice and had the same effect. Interestingly, you can see the ""cabinets"" in the editing section, you just can't get to them. If they are available somewhere within this package, they certainly aren't easy to get to, even for a computer user with over 20 years experience. Forget the money, I wasted a too many precious hours on this program.There are also no freehand drawing tools."
2,Don't waste your money,"I brought this version. I had an older one and believed this would give me more options to design. Well,they fooled me!I couldn't even figure the dare program out! The program, to me was designed for professionals not the novice like myself. I could get the basic floor plan down but changing to 3d, adding furniture,cabinet etc forget it. I was so disappointed that I would never recommend this program to anyone."
3,alright if the stories are your taste,"my favorite story was ms.byrd's One In A Million. iloved whitney and gregory's story and how they were able to rekindle their love and become a family with product of their love from so long ago their son. his sickness is what brought them together but it was worth it.ms.mason story was nice about a man who has grieved for so long that he doesn't even know how to love anymore after losing his wife to a tragic car accident.that is until he meets Sun a woman who makes him love all over again. Ms.Johnson's story was nice for a father and son relationship;however i didn't feel the romance between michael and jeanne.michael and bruce father son relationship was bitter in the start, but at the end their relationship was wonderful."
4,Mystic Chords,This is a very important work to understand how Americans developed their heros and create national myths. It was suggested by my doctoral advisor as valuable for my research into public history. Kammen explores how select groups and people in American History gain a public reputation and are used to define what it means to be an American. I found this work most helpful in placing Lincoln's rise to fame in the context of other memorial issues around the country.
3,CRACK THAT WHIP!,"I suppose it is terribly embarrassing, that one of the great icons of Hollywood's golden age finished up her career with a series of increasingly junky little movies--but Joan Crawford, like her arch-rival Bette Davis, simply didn't know when to leave her career well enough alone. And so now we are blessed with this ultra-lightweight script that has the seriously aging actress as a circus owner, trotting around the big top in fishnets and heels, snapping her whip, and worrying about how a strangely rising body count may affect her business--not mention her boy-toy.Now, it should be very obvious at this point that NO ONE is going to take this film seriously. And once you stop trying to take it seriously, it actually turns into one of those ""tacky fun"" films where you keep watching because you simply can't believe they had the nerve. But hey--Crawford had paid her dues, and if she wanted to go there, who are we to argue--especially with such a ""guilty pleasure"" movie at hand?"
4,The Queen Still Reigns,"Joan Crawford, in the next to last theatrical movie she did, shows why she was The Queen of Hollywood. It is very entertaining to see the then 68 year old Crawford take command of the screen with a script that is less than stellar and a cast of actors to match.There are echos of the Crawford we came to know from the Warner Bros. years with some of the sassy lines Crawford gets to throw out and plenty to hold the attention of the viewer with Crawford strutting around in the ring mistress uniform she wears.For pure kitsch and a laugh or two I say pick this movie up and get a taste of Crawford carrying a whole movie, bad as it is, and watch how a true actress makes it hang and hold your attention."
3,Enough Camp for Some Good Laughs,"During the late 1960's, Joan Crawford made a series of low-budget horror films to help pay the bills and to keep her name in the spotlight. ""Berserk"" is the best of these films, not because it is well-written or well-acted but because it is so bad it's good. Crawford, looking like a sexpot gone bad, plays the Circus Owner a la Mommie Dearest, spewing invective at the Business Partner and some of the performers. In the opening scene, she slugs a reporter and shoves people around while Gaspar the Great is ""hanging around"" the tightrope. The special effects are awful as this is a low budget film. But it is great for fun"
3,Great Camp...,"This movie is fun camp, especially since Joan is about 40 years older than her love interest. More like a circus documentary than a movie, the plot drags big time. A must for lovers of Joan, and camp..."
5,Amazon needs to correct the product info...,"This is a wonderful, widescreen presentation; Amazon has it listed as 1:33.This is a sentimental favorite of mine - I'm a big fan of these 60's horror/suspense films, and Crawford's inclusion is only a plus. She plays the usual ""tough as nails"" character, with a frightening side dish of sexual inuendo...eww!It has lots of character, and Michael Gough to boot! And the extended circus performance sequences are fun to watch; it makes me feel like a kid again!And last but not least, you get a bizarre musical number ""It Might Be Me"" thrown in to make you feel like you're in a different movie!Highly recommended!"
3,Psychotic Humor !,"This is another weird movie and fits into the same horror/camp category as ""Straight Jacket"" and ""Queen Bee."" It's kind of hard to be objective as I am a huge fan of all Ms. Crawford's films, and this one is no exception. Despite the psychotic edge to this film, there is a lot of humor however twisted. Maybe I have a warped sense of humor but I must admit, the way some of the characters were being murdered at the circus was kind of amusing. The VHS (video) version of this film is difficult to find. If you order it from Amazon Marketplace, beware of shesrunningwild1927 (seller). I tried ordering a video from them and never received it!"
3,It's becoming a nightmare...!,"""Berserk!"" is perhaps one of Joan's worst films of the 60's and the very worst suspense/horror film she ever made. The story is so over-the-top. Joan plays Monica Rivers, a lady ringmaster who decides to milk the publicity from a string of strange murders. The movie is still not totally worthless. Joan always gave a great performance no matter how ludicrous the script was and this is certainly no exception. This movie totally reminds me of another one of Joan's cult-classics,Johnny Guitar. Not just because it's incredibly dreadful and incredibly ridiculous, but also because there seems to be so much hostility and tension among the cast of characters in this picture. I also love the outfits that Joan wears (especially that black leotard.) And I sorta enjoyed the performances by Ty Hardin and Judy Geeson because they fall into that ""so bad it's good"" category. It's a nightmare!"
3,Joan Tries to Rise Above the Material ...,"Murder among sidewhow freaks and circus geeks ... plus Joan at the height of her campy-horror phase decked out in a Victoria's Secret ringmaster costume. Joan, Mistress of the Big Top, tries to rise above the proverbial ""it's-so-bad-it's-good"" script and almost succeeds. Throw in Scotland Yard, a few scary midgets, pointless elephant tricks, Joan's lacquered bee-hive hairdo, the obligatory ""surprise ending"" (a William Castle trademark), and you have a great flick for a Saturday afternoon!"
4,Beware - Running Time Badly Cut,"The details of this DVD show a running time of 96 minutes, as do the cover and all book references. However, the actual running time is only approximately 91 minutes. At about 81 minutes into the running there is a distinct cut in the middle of a scene with dialogue to a completely different scene of an outdoors night shot of a thunder and lightning storm. So not only cut, but very badly so. It could be that part of the original source is now missing. If so, the details should stipulate what the problem is. I tried to send an email to Sony Pictures in Spain, who seem to have produced the DVD, to enquire about it but was unable to on my home computer. Even though I translated the appropriate page, some of it was still in Spanish which I couldn't understand. I could neither complete a message nor send it."
5,Narita by Riot,"Very happy with the product, sounds great! Songs that I have never heard before, love reliving the late 70's with some good Rock!"
2,Disappointed,"Found this to be very uneven. Some chapters like the two by J.P. Mallory are good, and the number, types and quality of maps and photos are very good, but I have to take issue with a lot of the articles. It totally assumes that Harappans had written language despite the considerable evidence that has been brought to bear against that. It has a whole chapter on lost Roman legions, but says nothing about those lost at Carrhae. It doesn't address the BMAC at all. Several times, especially in the biblical sections, it is still going with the old mythologies and not basing itself on science. Expected more from this author."
2,Superficial sweeping ...,"It is a good coffee table book. If you really want to learn, then this book is not for you...it is merely a diving board to propel you to more serious, detailed writings. It is a brief reference, which if used for this purpose, is not bad at all."
3,Spotty,"This ambitious tome compiles a compendium of surveys about many sometimes contentious topics, mostly from ancient history. A large number of scholars contributed in most cases one of the articles. Therein lies its shortcoming. While that would seem to insure that an ""expert"" provided the information about each topic, it also leaves the reader with a mixed bag of quality. Some of them are excellent, well researched, even handed and objective. Others are ""party line"" propaganda that ignore evidence to the contrary. None of it is wild eyed, new age [stuff], though, so it has that much going for it. It's a worthwhile buy as a basic list, but a scholarly reader should use it as a starting point for further research rather than the final word."
2,To Simple,Doesn't cover enough topic nor in enough depth. Ok for mid-high or early high schoolers. Don't get this if your looking to do any sort of reseach.
3,To tight to fit,I purchased this product and discovered they do fit the holes in my 15 year old workmate. I had to sand down the units. Yikes
2,They don't fit!!!,"Don't know what has changed, but I bought these for a workmate that is ~15 yrs old. None of these pegs fit in any of the workmate holes! I'm going to have to sand them down to use. I can't believe that they would make the peg holes bigger on later models..."
4,swivel grips,"does what it needs to do on the workbench.works great, high grade plasticreasonably priced.easy to open, close and transport."
1,black and decker work bench,"This worktable is not useful. If i can return it, I like to return and get money back. There is no proper instruction how to use it.I had a such hard time assemble it."
2,Cost of pegs.!!!,I aquired an older used workmate and find this price for replacement pegs excessive!!. They drive people to throw away still usable gear and just buy new. Lame business practices in todays society that condones just throwing itmes away because it makes more sense to put that money into a new product. No wonder our economy is stuck.. It is geared to people throwing away and buying new.
3,Pegs won't fit without trimming,"I own one of the early Workmates that were made, from the early 70's. The original swivel pegs were blue, but I lost one. I ordered the newer orange pegs, which claim to fit ""all Workmates"", however, they are too tight for the holes in my old Workmate. I have had to do a lot of trimming of the orange stems to get them to work. It's workable, but definitely not just ""plug and go"". They require trimming first. Once that's done, they work fine."
1,Swivel grips do not fit,"Bought a package of 4 Black & Decker swivel grip pegs today. Slightly oversized from previous swivel grips. They do not fit either of my two Workmates -- one is a less than 2 year old Workmate WM-125, the other is an older Workmate similar to WM-225. Package and B&W website say fits all B& W Workmate products - not true!"
5,necessity,Without this product use of the work bench is limited. It save a lot of time and the need of an extra pair of hands to do a simple job.
5,Heart-Warming Meditations Upon the Past,"Much like the first book I recommended on Amazon.com (Reb Arthur Green's, ""Your Word is Fire,"" in my Listmania List on Neo-Hasidism), this is an inspirational work from the late great Reb Heschel. While not written in a way that is directly related to prayer or pray-ing, this work may inspire your head and your heart to such a means. Beautiful expressions of the ""golden era"" of hasidism's past."
2,"Good looks, terrible engineering","Ingenious concept and beautiful display, but the canisters suffer from some terrible design flaws:* The seal is not very tight and fine powders may leak while moving.* The twisting motion you must make to expose the pouring holes gets spices stuck between the lid and base, further promoting leakage.* The plastic cover is highly prone to scratching. A wipe with a cloth with a fine spice powder will easily produce scratches and clouding, marring your beautiful display.* You can't flush it under water without water seeping into a gap between the plastic cover and the raised circumference of the lip, which is nearly impossible to get out.I would have expected more from such an expensive spice rack. In retrospect I should have gone with a wall-mounted rack of old-fashioned glass spice jars."
4,As Advertised,"Read this book secretly(?) as a 15 year old boy. It was hidden(?) in the clean towels in the hall linen cabinet. Probably was put there by my Dad, since he never taught me about the birds and bees. So, this book provides a little bit of nostalgia."
3,name dropping,"a strange book. like a diary that has been altered. and you always wonder what he deleted. it has the feel of a very well connected man who cannot connect the story in a coherent way. not that it is a bad read, but the editor needed to take a pen to some of the people...."
5,I Would Add More Stars if I Could,"This book proves one thing and one thing only. Luckily, it's an important thing. Neal Pollack is the only man qualified to preside over these United States. That his sensitivity, his insight into the inner workings of the political machine, his extraordinary manhood even, should be overlooked by the voting public an instant longer would be a travesty. Or a tragedy. Take heed, people. Take heed and read. Knowledge is power. No, Neal is power. Isn't it about time we opened our collective eyes?"
3,Funny(ish),"Neal Pollack is in danger of fully earning his one-trick-pony reputation. This book has a few great moments (the chapter on The New Poverty chief among them), but otherwise it's rather repetitive. Neal Pollack's a funny man, but if all he can do is parody journalists and make cheap references to people that mean nothing to the average reader, then it's time we find someone else on whom to hoist the mantle of Savior of Literary Humor."
4,Great Starting Place,I have cruised many times before and found this book to be quite honest in its observations. We are sailing to Hawaii and I was able to find the information I wanted. I think this is a great resource for anyone considering a cruise vacation.
4,Looking forward to getting this book,I came across this book after doing a search on choriadal melanoma. My dad was diagnosed 5 days before Christmas. I am happy to say he was treated with Radioactive Plaque Therapy in NYC just this past week and the doctor tells us the tumor is dead - gone!! I believe I will have to wait a while until my emotions settle a bit to read it though!
5,Finding Noel,"Finding Noel: A NovelMy wife believes Richard Paul Evans ""walks on water"" and gives this book 10 stars. Her daughter also rates it a ""10"". Any book by Mr. Evans is an easy, quick read and thoughly enjoyable. Kick back, relax and enjoy a good read. Buy several copies---the book makes a great gift and you will be loved for giving such a great gift."
5,"""Finding Noel"" review","Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Had never heard of the author until I saw him on the Glenn Beck TV program. I liked the testimony he had, so I decided to read this book, along with ""The Gift"" and ""The Christmas Box"". They were all well written and enjoyable to read."
3,A Nice Christmas Book,"This is the kind of book I like to read around Christmas.It's not sugary sweet. There are warm , sincere people and a happy ending. This is an easy read and I cried a little at the end. Mark and Macy meet one snowy night a few weeks before Thanksgiving. Both of these people have had loses of loved ones . Both are ready to change their lives. There are no miracles or angels in the story . There are wonderful people .Finding Noel is a A- story."
3,Blah Ending,I don't know. I didn't find her character to be believable; I'm not so sure people who are abused so early in life can have that much of a positive outlook-especially when it comes to taking in a complete stranger.
4,Good feeling story,Always enjoy reading these types of stories around Christmas. Nice stories where you actually learn something and feel better for it.
4,Excellent read!,"A great story teller - Evans always brings a novel to life. As the Christmas season approaches Mark has to drop out of college due to finances and has just learned his mother has died and on one snowy night in November when he car dies, he stumbles upon a girl Macy who has had a horrible childhood and living with a lady who took her in. She has little memory of her birth parents and a horrible adopted family. Her one hope is to find her sister ""Noel"" as they were separated when they were children and kept apart by the system. Macy and Mark are meant for each other and fate has something in motion, as when one door closes, God places someone there for you. An amazing story - loved it!!!"
5,Finding Noel,This was the first book written by Richard Paul Evans that I have read. Just loved the story and Richard's style of writing. This was a page turner for sure. I bought a few copies of this book to give to some family members last Christmas (2006). Everyone loved reading it and had to have a box of tissues next to them.
4,Finding Noel: A Novel,"This is not one of Evan's best efforts, but it is still a good read. I read this book to my wife who is seriously ill, and she enjoyed it more than some his others. If you enjoyed Evan's other books, you will enjoy this one as well."
5,My baby can't get enough of this video,"My two year old son is obsessed with baseball. Most kids' movies that feature baseball do so minimally or in animated form. This was the first ""real baseball"" option for my lil' guy...and he just can't get enough! He wants to watch ""baby baseball"" (as he calls) it every day!"
1,Could not get it to work!,I could not get this card to work on my Dell L866. I contacted Visiontek tech support and actually got great service but still could not get the card to work. If you are buying this for a Dell I would reconsider.
5,Great Deal,"I recently switched from a crappy built-in graphics card to this visiontek GeForce2 mx400 64mb. I used the new game- Return to Castle Wolfenstein, to check out the differences. Not only does the game look soooo much better with the geforce -(high-res, dynamic lighting, perfect shading, and just about every cool visual effect)- it runs so smoothly too. I have yet to see any slow-down at all! And that's when i'm running the game at optimum graphics mode!!! I've tried a few other games and the dramatic results are the same. This GeForce provides some truly great performance for a relatively low price tag. I would highly recommend this product as a substantial and affordable upgrade.Also - Don't expect this graphics card to turn an old crappy computer into a powerful one. I'm using mine on a 1.3Ghz Athlon with 512Mb Ram, so it's a powerful system anyway. But the GeForce still makes a HUGE difference."
4,Reminds me...,"When I first heard this song it had a R&B sound to it, but it got softer later on and I really enjoyed it. Her vocals are beautiful just like her other songs, it has intertwined voices that have somewhat of a spooky feeling in the end...but better that way! Buy this cd! Even if you can't see the cover! It's great! ^.^"
5,Still goes strong in my mind,"This song was the official song of my 1986 Honda Civic wagon (my very first car that I bought with my own money while I was still in high school) last spring and it still goes strong in my mind. The groove is great although I find it difficult to keep the bass down low enough to not disturb my neighbours. (For Tsumetai Umi). But it doesn't second rate the melody at all... the combination of Mai's voice along with the instrumentals including the oh so lovely music box and the nice tune they have for it... I liked it so much I made the ring tone myself for my cell phone. Let's not forget the lyricsStart in My Life is something to ""cool down"" on and although I don't like it as much the other side of the single, the tune slowly grew on me. My suggestion? Get it!"
3,not bad...not bad...,"I've never heard of Kuraki's songs, until lately i've been buying alot of jpop. At first(before i even listened) i thought her songs was going to be terrible, cause some of my friend think she sings horrible. But after i listened to it, i realized i might have prejudged it. The thing is, this single isn't exactly that bad. I think i like Tsumetai Umi more than Start in my life. Probablly becuase i like the r&b in it.^^Although i have to say, that some of her songs and her image reminds me alot of Hikaru Utada.(many people thinks that she's just a second copy of Hikki) And like many of the reviewers mentioned, her english pronounciation isn't all that good. Personally, i prefer HIkaru Utada ,becuase i think she has more talent, more original and better voice.(and english pronounciation)But all in all, this single isn't really that bad. specially if you're someone that can stand listening to people singing in funny english."
5,Not a review either,"You would think that at these prices one would get the option to se the titles of these karaoke CDs. But no, just don't buy this product."
1,"Not so good, and I MUST even out the scores of NON-Reviewers","Party Tyme does not use real instruments, and their backup singers are usually poor..."
1,Sword Cane stand,So poor in quality that it broke as soon as several canes where placed in the slots. Very cheap quality
3,NOT a cane stand,"Notice that this is for ""sword canes,"" NOT regular canes with the rubber replaceable tips. They DON'T fit!"
4,Nice,"Very nice polo, good material and everything, but beware - it runs big. I bought it Size XL and it fits more like a 2 or 3X. So I would suggest if you buy this item, buy it a size smaller than you normally would."
5,Fabulous!,I'm so excited to have found that the music of Gary and Bill that I loved as a child is still available. These songs are terrific! And now I can share them with my own daughter.
5,one of Linda Ronstadt's finest albums.......,"My introduction to the music of Linda Ronstadt was a vinyl version of this album played on our family turntable. Ronstadt's strength as an artist is her ability to truly personalize each song that she sings and make them her own. What's more, her voice is filled with warmth, expression and soul. This album presents some of her finest and most well-known songs recorded with The Stone Poneys. They include the title song (""Different Drum""), ""I'll Be Your Baby Tonight,"" ""Up To My Neck in High Muddy Water,"" and ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow."" Though, some label her as a pop artist, her sound also has a wonderful folk and blues-inspired quality and clarity. Beautiful........"
5,SPEACHLESS,"MAN,ive been waiting on this for years.IT's the best thing to happen to gospel music in years.It's because of COMMISSIONED that i got saved.It was great to see the guys together on stage again.You can feel the electricity from the concert.I'll nver forget the first time I heard them in the early 80s.I've never been the same.I've been blessed from the first song I heard(Hide the word),to (I AM HERE),to my all time favorite(KING OF GLORY).I'll end tis by saying,I never thought the guys would ever come to my city,but they did,and I had the chance to play host to FRED& MARVIN.The result.For almost 9 years we've been friends. THE GREATEST GOSPEL GROUP EVER."
5,my thoughts of Commissioned Reunion,I have seen the video and I was thrilled to see that someone had it at a great price on dvd. The dvd was as hot as I remembered. Any Commissioned fan should make this a definite addition to their collection.
5,Loved it!,"I went to this concert when it came to Virginia. It was so good. It was nice to see Commissioned together again, and the music was more than amazing.I bought the video back then but played it so much that it was ruined. I finally ordered the DVD and I am so glad I did."
1,Complete and utter propaganda... and crap.,"A series of radical Islamophobic talking heads, basing their propaganda on a complete misreading of both the Quran and the Muslim world... it's stunning how people who are obviously educated and making a decent living in the world can be so full of miserable, idealogical garbage. Pathetic."
1,Hate filled propaganda,"Robert Spencer is well known Islamophobe and this film portrays Islam through same hate-filled lenses. If you want more balance information about Islam, I suggest PBS documentary - Empires - Islam: Empire of Faith."
1,Propaganda at its finest,"This is NOT a documentary. This is nothing but a web of lies, exaggerations and theories presented to display Muslims as blood thirsty animals to justify what the West is doing to Muslim countries. This ideology is shared by some Muslims- the inhumane terrorists that refer to Quranic verses based on completly different events and situations to satisy their own means. That group also represents 2% of the entire Muslim population. Just as the Christians crusaders killed with no mercy, just like some Christian sects believe that a man needs to marry as many women as he can to enter Heaven, and just like some Israeli Jews kill children without a blink, there are some messed up people of ALL religions- not just Islam. I am a Muslim, and damn proud of it. It is horrifying that this is represented as the truth, and that so many of you out there are actually believing it."
1,sharply biased documentary,"I am a muslim, and have not seen such a one-sided documentary about islam before. More than the negative comments of the scholars, the lack of opposite scholars is disturbing. They colected scholars that are all on the one side, and all of them without an exception have either misunderstood the message of Quran and the prophet or they intentionally divert the message. It would be more convincing if they have brought at least one scholar that could answer the allegations. They sometimes take a verse, without referring to the context of it, skipping the previous two verses that is essential in understanding it. If you have prejudices about islam and want to reinforce them, buy, otherwise buy something at least more objective."
1,Carefully Constructed Hate-fest,"This movie is awful! It's sole purpose is to bash Islam, to paint the religion in a negative light without ever examining all the dark early traditions of the Christian or Jewish faiths. It's cheaply made, dull, and is supposed to look authentic by featuring some constipated director of an organization no one has ever heard of and some geeky, self-important webmaster of very questionable authority or expertise. They even hauled out an fat ex-terrorist who is supposed to be a legitimate source of 'inside' information, and he is... if you want to know about terrorists. But if you want to know about the Islamic religion, don't waste your time on this hateful trash. Unbelievable that Amazon would even hock this type of film."
5,Incredible!,"This movie is the most powerful film available in this pivotal time in history. Elections are around the corner and I know that we better have a president who has the guts to speak and act outside the self imposing harm caused by political correctness. And let the American people know the truth. There are much bigger problems than gas prices, your light bill, your bad kids, your psycho boss, your crazy mother in law, your terrible outfit, your flat tire. This movie addresses one issue that threatens the freedom of everyone on this planet. Bad things happen when good people do nothing. Enough said watch this movie and then vote for a president even if he's the best of the worst who will not bow down to the deceitful and barbaric enemies that plot against the worlds freedom. Don't let this video just be another interesting thought provoking flick and then you do nothing. Spread it like you would if you had the cure to cancer itself. Do your part."
5,What the West Needs to Know,"This video will help you understand Mohammedanism and why the West needs to defend itself. Were you puzzled by the recent attack on the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo?""A firebomb attack gutted the headquarters of French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday after it put an image of the Prophet Mohammad on its cover.This week's edition shows a cartoon of Mohammad and a speech bubble with the words: ""100 lashes if you don't die of laughter."" It has the headline ""Charia Hebdo,"" in a reference to Muslim sharia law, and says Mohammad guest-edited the issue.Charlie Hebdo's website on Wednesday appeared to have been hacked and briefly showed images of a mosque with the message ""no God but Allah,"" after which the site was blanked.""This video will begin to enlighten you."
5,A must see.,"This really is something everybody needs to know. This DVD needs to be mailed to every member of the Senate, House of Representatives and the White House. Most people do not have a clue what they're dealing with. I believe this DVD gives a fair and accurate description without trying to sensationalize the issue. It's too bad that the most cardinal sin in our culture is to point to a religion and call it a religion of hate. Therefore, because we don't want the stigma of being ""intolerant"", we are conditioned to turn a blind eye to what should be an obvious danger and threat."
1,Islam: What the West Needs to Know,"This video is very well done in showing a link toMohammad, Islam, the Koran and present dayterrorists. It gives scholarly background and mixesit with compelling personal stories of terroristswho have now ""seen the light."" Seen in a ""narrowperspective"" I would consider it truthful and compelling.However It does not consider Islam outside of the MiddleEast and it shows no room ""for development"" overthe course of 1300 years as it spreads around the world.It classifies ""peacefulMuslims"" as a contradiction in terms who are eitherignorant of their religion or hold views which oppose it.If you would like a good stereotype of the enemy withwhich the West is in mortal combat in a ""Clash of Civilizations,""you will love it. If you want to take into considerationhistorical and cultural forces, you need to complementit with something else to give you the complete storyof millions of Muslims in our present day."
1,A half truth is still a whole lie,"This film is propaganda to create fear of Islam. I guess this is an attempt to further brain wash those that would watch it, who do not know any better and to support the US constant assault on Islamic nations as a valid fight for our safety,,,But, either way, this film is hate speech...A half truth is still a complete lie"
1,ill-conceived fear and paranoia mongering propaganda,Another shameful and self serving work of ignorance which serves only to fuel distrust and animosity between communities of differing faiths. Find something constructive to do with your time than fall for propaganda with purely negative and dangerous agendas.
4,Good commentary,"This is a straight forward dvd. While some of the professors are a little dry, the former terrorist is eloquent and succinct in his speech. He is captivating with his recounts of life as a terrorist. The dvd could be better perhaps with some real footage of extremists in action but it is still highly informative. I am showing it to my Sunday School class and a waking them up about what is said regarding Islam."
5,Incredible Truth!,"This video is eye opening and a lesson on the Kuran and how it's written, narrated mostly by a former Jihadist (PLO).... everyone must see this!!"
4,Important info at a critical time,"The content of the DVD is substantive and timely. The interviews and data provided do not come across as intending to foster anger, rage, or Islamophobia among non-Muslims. There is no shouting, name calling, or call to arms. It appears to be an honest attempt to catalog historical Muslim beliefs in a context that Westerners can comprehend. That said, taken at face value, the information presented is indeed disturbing. The only ding I would extend is that it feels extremely low-budget. It's basically a camera and a black leather interview chair, interspersed cuts to the text of the Koran now and then."
5,Sets a new standard for orienting our citizens to the real nature of Islam,"This DVD is a thorough review of the origins of the verses of the Koran, their relationship to one another, and the current status of how many Muslims seem to interpret the Koran. It, and Robert Spencer's book, ""The Truth About Muhammad"" are two necessary components to learning about the challenge that faces us."
1,At first glance made me question The Islamic Faith.,"I am studying religion and wanted to study up on the Islamic faith so i watched this documentary, only to be amazed at what i was watching. For such a popular documentary to be so one sided is ridiculous. I watched a half hour then shut it off, find a movie that talks about Muslims as people and not just verses and what the film makers wanted to say. The title of the movie throws you off thinking its going to be something an American (I live in the US) would want to watch, but its not. Do not watch this, if you want to learn anything useful...Dont waste your time and money."
3,"Islam like other religions of God, has been taken hostage","Looking at the news and hearing what is going on in the Muslim countries, one might agree with the content of this DVD and think of Islam as a religion that does not tolerate other religions. However, being born to a muslim family and having read all the books of great prophets, (Old and new bible)I have come to conclusion that all religions are good in their nature but when some people and mainly those in the religious leadership position misinterpret theactual messages of these holy books, and give it their own twisted meaning, they can mislead the masses in doing and believing something that is totally against the spirit of the religion. Islam , unfortunately has been taken hostage by some crazy hardliners and if you really want to know the true message of Islam without any bias, I suggest you take a look at this site - submission DOT org"
1,Save your $$,You can save your $$$ and wacth this online for free (u tube) additionally if you were hoping to learn something about anything from this video this is completely the wrong way to go about it. Credibility is nonexistent. Take any quotes with a grain of salt. This is not a far right work this is something which preaches hatred rascism and violence.In fact the recent works of the murderer in Norway who massacred more than 70 at a youth camp refers to Spencer and cites him and his works and ideas.This is a work of hate and racism period.
1,Learn and become a subject matter expert but this movie cannot help,"This video has a political motive and is produced by people who call themselves ""Atheist"". Our biggest problem is that we get easily convinced by movies and media forecasts. Best way to learn about any subject (may it be Islam or Christianity or any religion) is to learn it from the subject matter expert (known as ""scholars""), get right education, and master it well. Movies and videos cannot help our children to learn all the facts, and we run into danger of misleading information.Studies show, following 911 in NYC,Islam became the fastest growing religion as more and more people started to convert to Islam. Did this happen by watching videos or through researching the truth on this most popular religion in the world?"
1,wrong interpretation!,"what this author has done has picked through words in the fight that Islam had to make with those who fought it. Those who fought it did so in greed and did not want to lose money like so many people of the world today! How ironic after all these years those who are blinded by the true One God, Allah, are falling for crap like this!If you really do want to see a video about Islam, I suggest ""The Messenger"", made in 1976."
3,Late retrieval of DVD,"Finally recieved these 3 DVDs on July 22, 2011. A week late but arrived at last from Persius Products. gary masch"
5,Educational and enlightning,"I've already read Robert Spencer's book ""The Truth about Muhammad"", and have recommended it to others, but I found this video an even better tool with which to open the eyes and gain the interest of others as to the truth of Islam. After watching this all of those I've shown it to have gone on to purchase Robert's, Walid's, and/or Bat's books. Wonderful work guys."
5,"Islam, a cancer waiting to destroy our country","Most people look to religious diversity as a source of peace. With the Muslim religion we have a cancer waiting to destroy our country.This video sets us up to see why knowlegable sincere people feel that way. Islam is a sleeping giant waiting to destroy everything America has established since the founding of our country.This video is recommended because it takes brave people to expose the Islamic cancer. But if these people don't speak up for the truth the Islamic cancer will quickly take over and Americans will certainly be living the diabolical message of Muhammad, the MAD at the end of that name is what this so called illiterate prophet was. God bless people who make these types of videos.JR"
5,The truth shall set you free....,Brilliant DVD. The truth of this horror that exists on the planet must get out!!! Thank the heavens that there are people out there who will shine the light of truth on Islam.... I think I shall buy some more and mail to my two Senators and my Congressman.
4,An Important Warning to Western Nations,"While this is not great film-making or an outstanding documentary, it is a very important one. Today's mass media is so lost in its political correctness that we can never learn the truth about islam from them. So it is crucial, then, that someone step up and show islam for what it is: an irrational, hateful depository of 8th century pre-medieval mysticism -- anti-mankind, anti-womankind, and anti-life.It is frightening to think that 2/3 of the world's population still adhere's to 'prophet-based' religions (as if god needs prophets to speak to the rest of us), and half of that group holds on to this unenlightened primitive doctrine, and a large number of them will kill for it. This is a must see for anyone who is not clear about what islam intends for those of us who refuse to accept their 'truth'."
5,Islam What theWest Needs to Know,"Informative without being punitive. This is a must see for those who want to know more and become educated in the real Islam with out the smoke and mirrors; without the mystique, just bare bones truth. Understand ""Jihad"" and why the world has taken such a violent turn these days."
1,Ignorance is a dangerous thing,"This Documentary/Propaganda is a really sad example of how blind and ignorant people can take words and manipulate them to sell a single sided story.We can go back in history and dissect Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and we will conclude in very similar ways. there is always interpretation and allot of human error. the biggest mistake is to look at this information and group it and try to take things literally.I think in the end the only real advise would be for those who wish to know the truth is for them to go out and do their homework! read the Koran, read the bible..compare your texts against history and then you will know truth!There isn't one side to a story and I believe that this documentary needs to be reviewed and analyzed as a possible root for more Western ignorance that promotes hate where one should seek more understanding."
1,what the west need to know dvd,I received the wrong dvd 1 month ago! have not had a response from seller. They sent Crimson gold instead. I have not heard from them to send it back and get the right one. I don't have their mailing address. Please help.
1,appalling,"This movie is an opinion of somebody who thinks his ""knowledge"" will formulate other opinions like his own. I urge people to watch this movie and not to take it to heart. Examine the roots of Islam and how beautiful the culture really is."
2,I am reminded of a prayer on a bumper sticker I once saw:,"""God, please protect me from your followers.""Pretty much covers it from all angles.jwrit"
1,Hatred to Islam from non-muslim,"Hatred to Islambut still Islam is the fastest growing religion and the second biggest in the world, so dose that mean that most people don't understand and the auther of the film dose ?!?if you want to know about Islam go ask a Muslim scholar or go to a Islamic center or web site...and if you want to see a movie see Islamic Empire from PBC"
1,Islamophobic Propaganda,"These kind of shows are Islamophobic propaganda against Islam and Muslims. This show is to Muslims as Nazi Movie Makers are to Jews. This kind of hate initiated disinformation about Islam and Muslims need to stop. Muslims have been a part of the American fabric since the beginning days when Muslim European, Muslim Spaniard (Moriscos & Melungeons), Muslim African Slaves and Native American Muslims lived, worked, traded and built in America. For more information regarding Islamophobia, you can visit [...] or various other anti-hate organizations and communities nationwide."
5,Finally the Truth being revealed,"This Video, will turn the lights on in your mind, so you can see the truth, revealed, the real threat to you and I and our Nation and The world"
5,Maybe his best collection yet.,"I've grown quite tired of Sterling's novels. With the exception of the ""Schismatrix"" material (with I think is his masterpiece), his long-form fiction often degenerates into rambling narrative, inconsistent characters, and non-endings.But his short-story material is wonderful. I can't think of another writer who is so consitently imaginative, entertaining, funny, and insightful. I've enjoyed all of his collections, and none more than this."
2,Very hit or miss,"""Visionary in Residence"" (modest to a fault, Bruce is) is a real mixed bag. There are two or three nifty stories here, and a bunch of forgettable stuff.Sterling seems to be writing fiction out of some sense of obligation these days, not out of a love of it. His old stuff is often great, but anymore he obviously enjoys his Wired columns, his many (many) tech conference keynotes, and his pure design criticism (like the excellentShaping Things) way more. It's almost like he's writing these short stories in order to keep his SF Writer's Club membership card active or something."
1,"Oh Bruce Sterling, what happened to you?","I have thoroughly enjoyed most of Sterling's past works, but this compilation of short stories was just awful. Starting with the pretentious title (why not just name it ""Genius Author"" or ""I am a Brilliant Wordsmith""), every page I turned left me more aghast. Most of the stories read like the rough draft a college freshman would turn in for his first creative writing course. The sheer silliness of Luciferase made me put the book down for three days. The quality of these stories makes me think that Sterling needed quick money for a down payment on a new car."
5,Very comfortable and sexy too!,"If you're a man looking for a practical thong that you can wear all day, this is it. I know a lot of people feel that thongs should only be worn by women, but for a guy, nothing looks better under a well-fitted pair of jeans, and they feel great.However, never forget that mens thongs should only be worn by men with slim athletic bodies - ""the slimmer the guy the slimmer the underwear"" is a good rule of thumb (it works for swimsuits too!) If you're unsure about the suitability wearing a thong ask your wife or girlfriend first."
4,Sprint EVO contract,It is fairly standard to have a 2 year agreement for a smartphone now a days. I don't have any issues with the contract except for the extra $10 a month for a 4G phone.
4,delivery prestige,I like my product but delivery was terrible they just throw my package on the steps I will never want any of my packages coming from them try not to use prestige delivery.
1,"Just a ""come on""",While they may give you $150 towards a new phone you can always find a better deal here on Amazon. I never take them up on their offer.
5,Fantastic!,The Phone does more than anticipated. Transition from another carrier to Sprint went very smooth. And the savings of over $100 even better.
2,Really bad picture quality.,"Kimba The White Lion is a classic anime series that has been released on DVD by several different companies. The ""Ultra Edition DVD set"" has the original Kimba; the others have later re-workings of the series. This DVD here is one of 4 Kimba DVDs released by Genius Products. It comes in a cardboard envelope and contains 2 Kimba episodes: ""Egg Hunt"" (original title: Scrambled Eggs) and ""Jungle Restaurant"" (original title: Restaurant Trouble). These are the 1993 version of Kimba, not the original. The picture quality is really washed out; these DVDs were very poorly made. The only thing they have going for them is that both episodes have both an English soundtrack and and a Spanish soundtrack."
5,Hippo in my tub,Awsome!!! Easy to order and I got it quickly!!! Hippo in My Tub. It was great but silly i have to put more words.
5,Brings back great childhood memories!,"I bought two copies of this cd (one for each of my nephews). When my sisters and I were little, we had this as a record and loved it. We listened to it all the time. So when I became an auntie, I tried to find it, but was unable to until just recently. The kids love it as much as we did!! The songs are great fun to sing along to and I'm so happy that I found it!"
5,Great transaction!,"Shipment was quick, communication was good and I love the CD. We had the tape as our children were growing up and now we have the CD for our grandchildren!"
5,No child's collection is complete without this!,"I am 36 and had this ""tape"" growing up, I listened to it over and over and over. I now have 5 kids of my own (ranging in 8 months to 16 years) and the words of all these songs are in my head as though I was 5, I sing them to my children and the lullaby at the end has been a bedtime routine for all of them. I still have the tape but it is worn, I tried to find the CD back when my oldest child was born but it was not available and I recently tried to find it again and I am so excited to have this download available. This is a must have for any house with kids!"
5,Music for the Generations,"I grew up with this album, except it was vinyl back then, and now I'm going to get it for my newborn son because it opened up my imagination as a child and I want him to have that experience. My three year old niece loves ""hippo in the bathtub"" (or hey daddy) and always asks to listen to it. When I was young, my favorite was teddy bears' picnic and I always imagined that I was in the forest having a picnic with the teddy bears. I strongly reccommend this cd for little kids and big kids alike, but I wish it was easier to find in the states."
5,"Hard to Find ""Diamond In the Rough""!","I bought Anne Murray's ""There's a Hippo in My Bathroom"" LP to use in my elementary General Music classes in mid-1980's after hearing the song in an exercise class. It has been a big hit ever since! When my son was born, I would play the cassette to help him go to sleep. Anne Murray's naturally soothing voice worked -- almost -- every time. As my children grew, they would ask to listen to it in our van and we would sing along.Well-loved and used, I looked high and low for 6 months to find the cd version. This is how much you and your child(ren) will love it!!"
1,Extremely disappointing,"This book is far from complete. I was interested in finding out more information on full time employment opportunities for academic lecturers and professional experts on ships. This book is a guide on how to get free cruises by offering to lecture onboard. There is nothing in here that common sense would not dictate (if you know about a topic, then you can lecture about it ... seems self-evident to me!). The font is revealing ... GIGANTIC type which would qualify as large print by any standards. I have the impression that this is aimed at retirees hoping to get free travel. If you expect to get paid for your work, then this is not the book for you...I rate this the lowest possible rating, and that is too generous, especially considering that this is such a thin paperback with a steep ...price tag!"
1,not a good price,Actually I am looking to buy this book used . This book retails on Mary Longs own site as new for 1/2 this price. Check it out . Amazon has made some kind of error. do not pay this price . especially since the review with one star says that you are not getting much for such a thin book.
5,Excellent service,The product came quicker than was recommended in the email and the book was in excellent condition. Great price also
1,Almost worthless,"This timer is not a ""set and forget"" device by any stretch. You can set it to turn on at dusk and off at dawn, but it generally only works for one day before resetting itself to stay off permanently, until you set it again. None of the settings you program are saved, you can set it to stay on all of the time and before long it will just shut off and won't turn back on without your intervention. I have tried all of the different settings, hoping to stumble upon one that works, but no such luck. It may work properly for a day or two, but it defeats the purpose of having an automatic timer if you have to manually turn it on when you want it on. Might as well just plug and unplug the light. I guess the only pro I found with this item was that it was cheap in price as well as quality, but even getting ripped off a little is still getting ripped off."
2,"Worked last year. Not now, however.","I have two of these that worked fine for one year, then both started timing out prematurely, 5 hours became 4, then 3, .... I'll look for something NOT MADE IN CHINA."
5,I love this CD!,"I love this Glenn Jones CD...My favorite is #8 on the CD entitled ""In You"". My fiance and I have chosen this to be ""our"" song. It describes my fiance's heart towards me, better than no other song we've ever heard. We are looking for info on how to get the track to this song, so it can be sung at our wedding planned for February 5, 2000. If anyone has any info..please E-mail me. It will be greatly appreciated!"
5,This song is the bomb!!!!,"When my coordinator chose ""In You"" as the first song that my husband and I were to dance off of, I was not that excited--until I listened to the words. It was so beautiful and every time I hear this song, it brings tear to my eyes. This song fit my husband and I to a tee because we have been together since I was 15 years old."
5,Great DVD'S,The Bee Gees have released a two DVD set. Disc One is the story of The Bee Gees. Disc Two is the One Night Only concert. I don't have much of a say. Enjoy.
4,Great DVD. However......,"The first DVD ""One Night Only"" actually is ""The Official Story "".The second DVD ""The Official Story "" actually is ""One Night Only."" I bought this DVD from Amazon.CA. I don't know how this kind of mistake happen from the manufacturer. Otherwias, this DVD set is 5 stars."
5,EXTRAORDINARY!,"NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE WATCHED THIS DVD, I TRULY APPRECIATE THE QUALITY OF THE DVD PRODUCTION FORMAT AND THE PHENOMENALLY TALENTED BEEGEES"
5,Exceptional DVD,"I have an extensive range of concert DVD's, I must say this is my favorite. I was surfing Amazon and came across One Night Only. I have always enjoyed the Bee Gee's, but after watching this I have to say, they are truly unsurpassed! They are song writing legends and magnificent performers. This DVD is a must have. I enjoyed this DVD so much, I have bought 3 other copies for friends. Every song on this DVD takes you back in time, I had forgotten how many countless number one hits they had amongst the array of top 20 songs. This DVD is a must have to anyone that merely liked the Bee Gee's. You will not be disappointed"
2,Book is extremely hard to read,Book is translated from French and is ridicklously hard to read.There are better books out there about the medieval ages.
1,A poor description on the French middle age,"This book was a dissapointment. I was looking forward to receive it, because the subject interested me. The content may be of some value to a frenchman, especialy for one living in Paris, but there is hardly anything for the common man of the world."
1,Not User Friendly,"The user interface was very clumsy and difficult to figure out how to use. The online reference manual provided some help but I couldn't even figure out how to slope the grounds and the housing choices were terrible. I spent too much time trying to get the right house, resize it, build a deck - it was very frustrating and time consuming. I never got to do the thing I wanted to do and that was design my landscape!After two hours I gave up and tossed the software."
2,Rocket Science was a lot easier!!,"By the time you even learn how to use this software, you'll be too stiff and frail to get out ther and do it! I mean, this software is complicated to use, you just have a hard time getting a feel for it; in the end you just wanna chuck it in the "" I'll never use this software"" bin and write it up to experience."
1,mis leading,If you think you are buying a three pack you are sadly mistaken. Just opened the mail to find just one. The only reason I bought from this vender was the other site only had two left at $7.95 a piece). So three should be around 24 bucks. But instead i received one at three times the price $24.95. Change the picture....
1,"Deceitful, Sleazy Advertising","I, too, thought that I would be getting an entire box of pens at a closeout price. Instead, a large packaging box arrived with only a single pen in it. The advertisment in Amazon, however, showed an entire box of pens (12 pack) in it. With shipping and handling including, I therefore would up paying near $10 for a single pen. SLEAZE, SLEAZE, SLEAZE!!!"
2,I was hoping I could use this pen on all my Christmas and Chanukah cards. It didn't live up to my expectations!,This pen is a disappoinment. It doesn't write evenly--dries up very quickly. Would not purchase it again. Wish I could get a refund!
3,An Artist of Interest,"Frances Langford is one of those great girl singers from the 40's. Whilst the films are not exactly MGM A class they are non the less enjoyable, and titles which i did not know.Being a musicals lover i just had to have them, I did try logging on to the company web site to see what else they had in this series, but could find nothing, not even this item. All they seemed to list were current big budget titles. Pity because i feel sure i would buy more of this series if i had the information."
2,Fragile valve parts. Short life.,This works about as well as any inexpensive in line hose valve. They can be handy. As with many of them the plastic valve handle assembly breaks off. It lasted me around 8 months. Better to get an all brass one.I use these in line valves as sprayers. When the valve is partway open most deliver a satisfactory spray for boat washing ect. without a separate spray head. This does not because of the hose length. This is very convenient when you have an outboard engine with a flushing port where you screw the hose on the the port then flush it with water. The added distance from the valve makes it easier to use.
1,Wrong Part,"No description of the item, as in what saw it fits, whether it was for a right tilt or left tilt saw, contractor's saw, whatever, was available either on Amazon, or from the actual seller. By the depictions given, it seemed it was a universal fit for all Delta table saws. I unwisely took a chance ordering it, and will be returning it. I was able to get the correct insert with help from DeWalt/Porter Cable."
4,Good read for the casual fan.,"Interesting look at the life both inside and outside of the ring for Adam ""Edge"" Copeland. Very quick, easy read. I would not recommend this book to the hardcore wrestling junkie. Everything seems dumbed down and basic which left me wanting more. Note: This book was written well before Edge retired. No details or mention of this in the book."
5,Great read.,"Edge aka adam copeland, actually writes his own book like fellow wrestler and autbor Mick Foley. Adam is highly inteigent and extremely funny and witty. He is not afraid to expose his true self. I like how he describes what a big metal fan he is."
3,its okay,i wanted to buy this book right after i heard about it and although i think Edge is one of the greatest superstars ever i did not think the same of his book. It started out all right but he puts quotes from the page to the side which really annoyed me and i found parts of it to be a little dull. But some parts were fantastic like how he described his matches and talked about his fellow wrestlersthis book was alright but i would only recommend it to Edgeheads
4,A really well done personal look....,"This book feels way more personal than most wrestling biographies. It was done well, and made for a quick enjoyable read. I would recommend any fan of Edge, or interested party to read this book."
4,Edge Head,"Good and quick read. Very funny. Honest and well written. If you are a wrestling fan, you will enjoy this book even if you haven't read it yet and it is a few years old, it is still a good read."
3,Decent Read,This is a decent read but Edge is not one of my favorite performers so it does not get a high rating.
3,You Thought You Knew Him,"Adam Copeland, aka EDGE, talks candidly about his profession, you don't get the impression that he BETRAYS the profession he works in by going into thorough detail, he also has great deal of FREINDS LIKE MATT HARDY, AND actually details his broken neck, his frustration with missing two Wrestlemanias, and the latest love of his life, LISA.Now, read every Capital letter in order above and I think you'll get the message, in the meantime this book is a worthwhile read and a look into the lifestyle of a wrestler who true CARES about his family, and who cares LESS ABOUT leaving the buisness when FREINDS LIKE MATT HARDY live in it to comfort him"
2,You think you know Edge because I still have no clue,Well I have read this book not expecting all that much and was I right this book while the beginning of the story is a really great read but the whole middle of the Book when he gets into the WWE is just jibber jabber storylines and Wrestling spots that we seen on TV and The things that was seemily to get into reading alittle into he just saunters off into something else completly which another match he had on Smackdown or a PPV he was in this book was more of recap matches that you could watch on a review show on Heat or Velocity this book seriosly leads not to much of really knowing this man at all but seemily the book had some funny parts in it for a laugh the best joke was he actually thought Brood merchandise couldn't stay off the shelves this book is a book is only considered to me as lending material at the local library
1,Don't buy this book.....,It is a horrible and very boring book. This book was written way too soon in his career.
4,Quite Pleased,"I must say that I was fairly impressed by Adam Copeland's account of his rise to the top of the WWE. In his own words, Edge chronicals the trials and tribulations that made him the wrestler and man that he is today.Peppering his book with just the right amount of humor, it is a fairly quick read as the language just seems to flow in a nice manner. His personal stories and anecdotes give the book a nice friendly aura to it, and it is hard not to get a feel for what he was going through along the way simply because he wrote every word of it by himself without a ghost writer. This autobiography will definately keep you on Edge."
4,Very entertaining.,This book was a very good read. Edge manages to tell the story of his entire life with very good pacing and keeps it fun to read. Unlike most wrestling related books he never goes into long boring stories about his training methods or anything like that. If youre a fan of Edge or of wrestling in general Id recommend this.
5,Great Book,"This book has kept me glued from the beginning. With pictures to look at while reading the story, it helps keep my attention. Edge is so good at telling a story and keeping the reader glued until he finishes it. He's had many funny stories happen to him, so anyone looking for a good laugh should read this book."
2,I think I know... this book is awful.,"I took this with me on vacation, and while Edge seems to have an interesting story to tell, his mechanics of telling the story are distracting. You really get the feeling as if Edge were right there with you narrating the story, but that's not a good thing. He repeatedly drops names, spouts clichés, and rips off Mick Foley's gimmick on ripping on Al Snow. Edge's childhood and the early part of his career are interesting, but the final third of the book is definitely skim-worthy. I would definitely say this book lacks the crossover appeal that Mick Foley or even Ric Flair had, but wrestling fans will probably enjoy it to some degree."
4,Big Help!,The checklists are a big help. They are very helpful for those students that you are unsure if you are going to retain them or pass them on. You often worry about promoting a student with questionable grades and work habits. The checklists help you to decide if that child truly needs to repeat the same grade or be promoted. It also talks about continuous communication with the parents. Communication is so important and the checklists give you a place to keep track of what you have communicated with home and they with you. This book is a must if you have ever questioned promoting/retaining a student.
3,ok product but costs 5 times what it should,"I got the wood version. It looks nice, but it is made from cheap wood and the movement looks and sounds like a cheap import. It isn't bad, but it isn't great either. This has the same old mechanism as the metronome my family had 30 years ago. I am dumb founded that this costs $100. I would expect $10-$20. Where's the competition? I doubt it costs more than $5 dollars to make. Someone is making a killing off this.I gave it three stars because the product is ok. The wood finish looks fine, it just doesn't feel fine nor does it operate smoothly like a $100 product should. I haven't seen the plastic version, but it costs like $50 and is possibly even more of a rip-off."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED... plastic case... NOT Wood ... description misleading...,Very disappointed... the description was a bit misleading this metronome casing is PLASTIC... and does not look like wood (no matter what planet or country you are from).Overpriced!!
4,size and material,my only compant would be that it is not maid in the U.S.A.( fit was per chart) The brim was the same size as I remember from the old days.
5,A Christmas Carol With George C. Scott,"This version of a Christmas Carol takes the things that are truly important from all the other Christmas Carol movies and puts them together in such a way that you cannot help but feel that you are really there, witnessing this miser's destiny. The fact that it was actually filmed in the historical town of Shrewsbury lets one know that the director was driven to potray what actually took place, if, it was a true story. George C. Scott by far potrays the best Scrooge with his intense emotional acting.The music in the movie is wonderful along with the costumes and sets.If you have not seen this version of a Christmas Carol you have missed the best!"
5,"Best Scrooge, bar none, now coming to blu-ray!!!","I can't wait for this wonderful telling of the Dickens classic, now coming to blu-ray! It truly deserves this kind of treatment. Scott was tremendous, and I always adored the performance by Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present. God rest his soul."
3,I love the Christmas Carol movie,"I chose this Christmas Carol among many because of George C. Scott. I watched this movie during the Christmas holidays with my teenaged daughters. The three of us agreed that this movie didn't place emphasis on the young boy and his family the way some of the Christmas Carol movies do. We missed that part of the movie. So if you like to see more scenes with the young boy and his family, do not purchase the movie. Other than that I love the Christmas Carol story because it shows the true meaning of Christmas, the spirit of giving to others in need."
3,nice try,"I bought this version of A Christmas Carol based upon the reviews I read here. Big mistake! George C. Scott was great as Patton, but he doesn't show the range of emotion that a character like Scrooge requires. His transformation comes late in the game, and it seems motivated mostly by fear of how others will remember him. I still much prefer the Alastair Sim version as the definitive version. There is no better Scrooge, no better Marley, and no better Cratchet. And it continues on down to Tiny Tim. Hands down the best cast and best screen adaptation. This version is better than some, but overall it just doesn't really cut it for me."
2,"This ""Patton meets A Christmas Carol"" is missing one important ""spirit""","Great production values, costumes,cinematography...but this version is as serious as a heart attack and almost as fun..the great George C.Scott (unfortunately)portrays Ebeneezer Scrooge nearly the same as he played George S. Patton (in one of the greatest screen bios ever made, incidentally) ...a pretty joyless outing of this classic tale which also lacks the spark and entertainment value of so many of the other versions...check out SCROOGE starring Albert Finney for an ultimate version along with the classic animated MR.MAGOOS CHRISTMAS CAROL"
3,I find it hard to enjoy this as a Dickens story when...,"its lead character hasn't the least bit of an English accent!George C. Scott is appropriately grumpy, etc. but give me Alistair Sim anytime. However, I know there are folks who don't like black and white movies, and if that is the case (don't get the colorized one for goodness sake!) I would guess you probably would be willing to forgo Dickensian atmosphere --therefore, this version is as good as any other, as the supporting cast is excellent and the adaptation itself is very good."
3,George C. Scott Is an Excellant Actor But He Needed To Learn How To Do A British Accent!,"This is not the best version of A Christmas Carol but it is pretty good and George C. Scott is a truly gifted and excellent actor and I think his acting in this version was good though his British accent was terrible. I have seen him in other movies playing British characters and his English accents were either not very good or he didn't even bother to use one as seems to be the case in A Christmas Carol, Jane Eyre, The List Of Adrian Messenger, etc. I know I will probably get slammed for saying what I said about a beloved actor and pointing out that he couldn't do accents but I'm just being honest!"
5,The Best Christmas Carol Movie!,"In my opinion, this is the best version of A Christmas Carol that has ever been filmed. George C. Scott does an excellent job as Scrooge. He is very believeable in this role.I also feel that it paints more complete pictures of the daily lives of the different characters.I bought it this year to watch with my family at Christmas. I would like to make that a family tradition.I highly recommend this movie for the whole family!"
5,George C. Scott at his best!,George C. Scott brings to life one of the all time Christmas stories as no one before or after has. This is the absolute best version of this timeless story. Imagine General Patton as Scrooge. That pretty much sums it up. A GREAT supporting cast rounds the story off and is a must watch every single Christmas season. I am so glad it has finally made it to BlueRay!
5,The Best Ebenezer Scrooge,"This version of A Christmas Carol is our favorite! George C. Scott is a ""Master"" at playing this character. We watch this at least three times during the season!!! A must have!!"
5,One of the best Scrooges of all time!,George C. Scott is great as Ebenezer Scrooge in a great production and a really pleasant surprise. Very atmospheric of old London. Mr. Dickens would approve...
1,Production Error!!,"Yes, yes, yes, the movie is great, per many other people's reviews here. However, the copy I received was in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, rather than the full-screen 1.33:1 which it should have been (and as was indicated on the back of the case). So, until this production issue is fixed, I recommend NOT buying this movie for now, unless you like seeing the tops of people's hairlines cut off. I don't know why something like this would happen, but then, I don't work for Fox Entertainment, who seem to attract much vitriol from people these days..."
1,Sad there's no zero instead of one for stars,"I am thoroughly disappointed and quite angry. I ordered this movie in good faith and planned to enjoy it with family. I have every Christmas Carol from 1935 (England)original to Disney's Jim Carey version. After convincing the family this was one more worth watching, it plainly stunk! Hardly a third into it, freezes and skips kicked in. What a piece of crap and huge disappointment. To make matters worse, I I I I I have to pay for the $2.98 shipping to return the garbage for a refund?! Just to get a replacement??! I didn't even ask for my money back! All I wanted was the DVD I ordered in good working order. I get a piece of crap and I have to pay and it ruined our Christmas traditions night. Don't take the risk, it isn't worth it, find the movie at Walmart or somewhere else. It is a great movie and a good George C. Scott rendition, just do NOT trust this vendor."
2,lower class adaption,"I saw this video two weeks after reading the book. It came across as flat and lifeless compared to the book and the 1951 Alastar Sim version I have. Instead of taking you back to the time of Dickens, it takes Dickens up to our time. Another problem is that the characters have lower class characteristics with their confrontative behavior and their arrogance which is always a cover for incompetence."
3,A Christmas Remake,"This is a fair film, but nothing when compared to ""A Christmas Carol"" starring Alister Sim. The actor just doesn't ... become the part. It's look whatching a sequal or a remake to a classic film. I don't know why so many people here have rated it so highly, I'm dumbfounded. Buy Sim's version, forget this one!"
5,The Best Christmas Carol,"I watch this every year. George C. Scott can play mean or nice with the best of them, which makes the character believable. The music is very good, too."
4,One of the Made for TV versions,"While I prefer the ""Christmas Carol"" films that appeared in theaters (1938, 1951, 1970), George C Scott, Best Actor winner in 1970, does an effective job in portraying Ebenezer Scrooge, London's biggest miser of the Industrial era. Includes some additional footage during Scrooge's visit from the Ghost of Christmas Present. This includes a displaced impoverished young family. Living in a slum of London, it gives the wealthy Scrooge a view of the non-wealthy population of the industrial era. A good film and I ernjoyed it."
5,THIS IS MY VERY FAVORITE !,"This is my favorite Christmas movie. I love watching an old man who loves his money so much, that is his willing to give his soul to keep his money....then his eyes are finally opened to the real meaning of Christmas."
2,Posted as HD but appears to be standard definition,I paid extra to get the HD version but that isn't what was downloaded. The sound is Dolby ProLogic (not Dolby Digital) and the video quality seems to be only standard dev. I will be contacting Amazon for a replacement or refund.
5,Favorite Christmas story,Good version of Dicken's Christmas Carol and George C Scott does a commendable job of playing the roll of Scrooge.
4,Good!,"I have seen several different movie adaptations of A Christmas Carol and have liked them all but I think the three best versions are this George C. Scott adaptation, the Alastair Sim adaptation and the adaptation starring Patrick Stewart and I also like the adaptations starring Albert Finney, Reginald Owen and Sir Seymour Hicks. This adaptation is very good and I'm very impressed with George C. Scott's acting, he gave an excellent performance as Ebenezer Scrooge and I also liked David Warner as Bob Cratchit and there are many other fine performances too, Edward Woodward, Suzannah York, etc. I very highly recommend this adaptation which seems pretty faithful to the Charles Dickens classic book and I like that they included aspects of the book that are not in the other Christmas Carol movies! I got this DVD as a Christmas gift back in 2002 and it's a good DVD!"
2,Not a fan of this version,"I see that the review of this version are largely positive. I disagree. I just watched most of it on TV. ""Quality"" acting is as much a matter of one's tastes as of objective standards. I thought Scott's acting was OK, if a bit overdone, but the direction plodded, and the ghosts, especially the Marley's Ghost performance, were so badly over the top that they would have fit better in a remake of Rocky Horror Picture Show.I recommend sticking with the Alistair Sim version.Of course, your tastes might differ from mine."
3,"If you want the classic, this ain't it.","While this version may be a popular one, it was not the one that I was thinking of. Looks like the original one was the one I was after. Great version of the movie, but not the right one for me."
4,Rental charge is to high at $9.99,"The movie was fine, good family Christmas movie. The price for renting the movie is way too high. The label said $8.99 to rent however I was billed $9.99.I won't be renting from Amazon again due to their sky high prices."
5,DVD,"Good service, prompt delivery and met all our expectations...The better of the Christmas Carol productions."
5,Apologies to all Trekkers...,"...but even as a life - long Star Trek fan and a huge admirer of Patrick Stewart, I believe there has never been a better filmed adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol."" Despite being the only non - British member of the cast, only George C. Scott has ever pulled off the transformation of Scrooge in such a convincing and believable manner. In addition, the casting, the acting, the directing and the musical score all add up to an unbeatable holiday experience. Even ""the poetic license"" of the expanded scene at Fred's home on Christmas morning (which goes beyond what Dickens actually wrote) adds tremendously to the lump in the viewer's throat by the end of the story.A Christmas Eve viewing of this movie has become an annual event in our home."
5,Great movie,"The sound of the grim reaper was the only thing in this movie that has always gotten on my nerves. But as always, George C. Scott is the man. A seasonal classic and my favorite of the other Christmas Carol versions."
3,A Christmas Carol disappointment,"I gave it an 3 star because being in Blu-ray, I thought it would be in wide screen but it wasn't."
5,George C. Scott as Scrooge,"Another must-have version of 'A Christmas Carol'!!! Scott is amazing as always, the actor playing the younger version of Scrooge really looks like Scott."
5,The only A Christmas Carol worth watching.,"I watch three movies at Christmas: A Christmas Carol w/ George C. Scott, White Christmas and It's a Wonderful Life. It's not Christmas without 'em. In my opinion, there is no substitute for this particular rendition of A Christmas Carol. I refuse to watch anything else. It's cold, creepy, sad, and perfectly acted. Watch it, make it your own Christmas tradition--you won't be disappointed."
3,Not the best but solid,"Item arrived well packaged, on time and as described in the item description. Great quality and can easily recommend to others."
5,Best version of this movie by far. George C Scott is awesome as Scrooge.,"All characters are portrayed better in this version than any other. Not only is George C. Scott the best Scrooge, but this version has the best Fred, Marley, ghosts, Bob and so on. also, this version is very well directed and has some great lines from Scrooge that no other version has."
4,Scott is the best Scrooge,We recorded on tape a broadcast by PBS of George C. Scott playing Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. But unfortunately the reception was not good and thus the tape was not a good rendition of this story. So we purchased the DVD from Amazon and watched it as soon as we received it. We think Scott is a truly good actor and his Scrooge is marvelous.The HatchersRoyal Oak Michigan
5,excellant movie,one of the best a christmas carol movies i've ever seen. all the scenery looks authentic for the time and place
4,A Christmas Great!!!,George C. Scott is brilliant as Scrooge and masterfully plays the miserly old man turned good by the Ghosts of Christmas. A good cast and extremely decent acting make this Christmas Carol a Christmas must!!!
4,Great Movie,I have several versions of this movie. George C. Scott does a great job as Scrooge. I recommend this version.
1,Disappointed - no plans,"I was disappointed when I went to the wood plans and found that all those shown, except one, were discontinued or not stocked. Why show them if you don't have them?Had to give you 1 star to process, wanted to give you zero."
1,Drab story badly pieced with amateurish stylings,"How can anyone read this without feeling like their intelligence has been insulted? My friend loaned me this book, saying, ""You've got to read this book."" I was intrigued by the story idea, but after reading it, I felt stupider for having read it. The character Amanda is oppressed by her abusive senator husband and retreats into dreams about a dream lover named Seth. She meets a detective named Jefferson Dupree (who coincidentally looks like Seth), whom, she finds later, out of no cited incidences, has always been called Seth. The writing is simplistic, the story is drab; it is an uninteresting piece of blather."
4,inspireing,"Michelle Bras is a pioneer. His food is so beautiful and inspireing. I would reccomend this book to professionals and home cooks alike. If you love food, this is a must have!"
4,Trettioariga Kriget - The Roots Of Swedish Progressive Rock,"Kriget were and still are one of the first great progressive rock bands to hail from Sweden. This, there debut album has been re-mastered and sounds fantastic. These guys had their own unique sound and don't really sound like anyone else I can think of. Lots of heavy jamming guitar with vocals in Swedish. The vocals may turn off some U.S. fans, but give this music a chance. These guys influenced many of today's modern Scandinavian bands and are the original real deal."
3,"ODD LITTLE FILM, BUT MARJORIE SAVES IT.","Unless you are a diehard Marjorie Main fan, you might want to catch this on TCM instead of purchasing it. Not up to snuff with other MGM/Main vehicles. Still, she is always a delight. It's just not a film I will be watching more than once."
5,Interesting,"I admit having not read the book, but I AM familiar with the title, since Mr. Johnstone mentions it in one of the ""Ashes"" books as having been one of the books written by his fictional alter-ego, Ben Raines!"
2,Very disappointing,"Unfortunately, this book does not do justice to Sarah McLachlan's music. I love her music but this book was really disappointing. You can barely recognize any of the songs when you play from this book. In my opinion, the arrangements are very poor. Granted this is easy piano, but I have played other similar books and they sound much better. I highly recommend NOT to buy this book. As a matter of fact, I will be more than happy to send you my copy. I rated this book with two stars because of the nice cover."
4,Good for the price,"This camera does exactly what it's description says, but if you are using a long video cable (in my case it's about 50 feet), it will only record black and white footage. This is probably due to the resistance in such a long cable which creates a loss in quality."
1,Wrong Item,"An internet search for a West Bend OBLONG Slow cooker 84754 shows availability through Amazon.com and CosmeticMall as the company supplying product. Item I thought I was ordering based on link ""BUY NOW"" actually orders an OVAL Crock Pot with a totally different item number. Of course that is not obvious as you place order because no number is shown in title. I didn't want or need a crock pot and I would never pay $18 to ship something I could buy at a local store. My total cost was over $50. I requested reimbursement for return shipping to no satisfaction. Both companies have lost my business."
3,Good for starters,"This was a good choice for a first crockpot. The operation is simple, it comes with easy instructions as well as starter recipes. It is definitely a sturdy piece and the crock cleans up easily. My disappointment is that you really can't cook on the high setting, it is too high. As well, the low setting cooks too quickly. My research prior to purchasing this showed that this is apparently a common problem with crockpots, now I know what to look out for."
4,A good intro to Behavioral Finance,"Markets are not efficient in part because Investor Sentiment is a strong factor creating momentum (either upward or downward trend, whether sentiment is positive or negative). Also, arbitrage is very weak, as there are no proper securities substitutes, shorting the indexes is too risky. The ""Noise Trader Risk"" is too great. Meaning equity values may continue to diverge long enough for the arbitrageurs to loose their shirt betting on convergence. The investor type is a very important characteristic to factor. This explains the close end fund puzzle. The discount on closed end fund tracks the fate of small cap stocks. When small cap stocks do poorly, the discount on closed end funds deepens. This is because both investments are dominated by the same type of investors: individuals - small investors. Thus, both investment types are subject to small investors' sentiments."
3,Too much maths but interesting interpretation,"There is too much maths in the book. However, the comments and interpretation on various models are very interesting. The authour distinguish between arbitrageurs and noise traders. He also give us a theory of substituability which is interesting but inapplicable in reality. Too much theory also with a lot of hypothesis that are not respected in real markets.I was looking more for a book on investment psychology and I was disappointed."
2,Not so great...,"I think this is a pretty boring album. The music is samey, generic, and dull. By the time this record came out in 1978, April Wine were pumping out hits faster than the assembly line in a factory! They sound like they're just trying to churn out as many hit singles as possible, without giving much thought to the individual songs themselves. Their attempts to write catchy hooks and arena rock choruses sound forced. There aren't any particularly original or interesting songwriting ideas expressed here, the whole thing just seems redundant compared to their other albums. As far as I can see, I'd say that they didn't really have anything to say when they made this......they were just churning out filler to keep the royalties coming in. I really don't recomend this cd to anybody. It represents the ""Dark Ages"" in April Wine history. Definately not their best......not by a long shot."
4,like it,"THIS CAME OUT IN THE LATE 70`S,AND HAD SOME PRETTY GOOD ROCKERS ON IT ALONG WITH SOME GOOD BALLADS.LOVE THE SONGS GET READY FOR LOVE,ROLLER AND RIGHT DOWN TO IT.GOT TO SEE THESE GUY IN CONCERT IN 79 AT THE CALIFORNIA WORLD FESTIVAL WITH AEROSMITH AND UFO AND THEY WERE ONE OF THE BEST BANDS THERE.THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE CD`S BY THESE GUYS,THEY JUST NEVER MADE IT BIG IN THE US BUT THEY WERE STILL A GOOD BAND"
3,"Nature Of The Beast is available on CD, I have it.","You can find it in many retail stores and some on-line stores. Don't give up, AW fans!"
3,"Not the best, but still good.","April Wine broke out with this album. The song ""Roller"" is one of the best tracks available. Since ""Nature Of The Beast"" is not available on CD (and who knows only why not), this is a good place to start. It definately rocks, if nothing else."
5,First Glance,"April Wine's 1978 release First Glance is an excellent collection of rockin' tunes. All nine tracks are enjoyalble. Roller is the most memorable of the songs, of course with its killer riff. Also notable is Rock n Roll is a Vicious Game. If you enjoyed their biggest American hit 1981's ""The Nature of the Beast"" you'll enjoy this one as well. Worth tracking down on vinyl or old cassette."
3,A snap shot in time.....,"Brining back memories of a fire bird, warm Busch Beer and Jensen 6X9's. If you can't attribute memories like that to this album then it really isn't that great. Like most music from the late 70's to late 80's: if you didn't grow up during those times the music isn't so great nor meaningful. I love this album along with Nature, Harder Faster and Power Play."
4,Very good/hard to find cd.,I bought this cd because my original album is worn out. I'm very happy to have found it. It sounds pretty good considering. Good cd & Good service!
3,Great for garden schlep but no good for jumping up & down on a shovel,"Great for garden schlep but no good for jumping up & down on a shovel.These are wonderful for leaving by the door so you don't ruin regular shoes or track dirt in (I have been known to think I could tiptoe into the garden ""just this once"" while wearing high heels upon seeing snails. Ergo I have ruined shoes). HOWEVER...there's no way you can wear these and use your foot to force a shovel into dry or hard soil/dirt; you might as well be barefoot. It doesn't hurt; you just don't get the force a rigid shoe sole would convey/transport/(some physics term).So: They're great for schlepping & they clean/rinse well but they're no good for *heavy* duty gardening."
3,Not as described,"From the description and photo, I thought I was receiving shoes to replace some that looked identical, with no tread at all on the bottom. I wear them into the chicken coop, and in mud and stickers and didn't want any tread to collect anything and track back in. When they arrived, they had rubber tread. When I returned them I had to pay postage of over $7.00. Really disappointed in that, paid postage for them to come, they were not as described and I had to pay return postage."
2,Sloggers,I purchased these Sloggers to use when I garden. They looked very nice but they slip off when you are walking and your feet get wet. I do not recommend these Sloogers for gardening.
2,They Shrink!,"When I bought the first pair of Sloggers, I bought a size 8. After about 2 months, I couldn't get my foot into them. I went back and bought a women's 9. My foot was a little loose in the shoe at first, but it continued to shrink and now, I can't get my foot in the 9 either. The store says they will refund my money. I'm amazed that there are no other complaints about them shrinking. Not only are they much smaller, but the toe curls up as they shrink!"
1,poor customer service,"We received very poor customer service from Plastex. Item was expected to ship out in 1 week from order. After 3 weeks, we contacted Plastex; item had not been shipped even though it was in stock. Interactions with the Plastex customer service representives were extremely difficult."
4,An invaluable reference for debuncing scripture,"Primarily, this book is an outstanding resource. Mr. Mckinsey has given problematic scriptural references for just about any topic you may wish to examine. Upon reviewing the contents, you are able to discover some of the most probelematic areas without having to comb through all the tedious chapters of the Bible. The only real problem I have with the book is McKinsey's style of prose. He ends many of his arguments with flimsy statements and rhetoric. Overall, however, the volume glitters with the knowledge that must have been gleaned through years of research. A beneficial read for anyone who was ever curious about the validity biblical scripture."
5,Why wasn't I born with this book?,"In a world of lies, this book breaks the conventional mold of deception and honors the brave souls who have throughout the ages sought after that most horrible and unwanted conception: ""truth"".A great Christmas stocking stuffer!!!$33 should have been the shipping charges...BUY IT!"
4,Favorite book this year,"We have bought 5 Hanukkah books for our 1-year old daughter this year, and this one is the best. The pages each have flaps to lift, with sparkley inlays to catch her attention. The rhymes are nice, and it touches on many of the facets of Hanukkah observance(dreydels, latkes, donuts). It doesn't cover the religeous or historical significance, but I doubt any board or pop-up book could do so in a meaningful way."
1,Culturally insensitive,"This book is charming in many ways--in an artistic sense the art is lovely and the rhymes are cute. But the cover shows it all: candle flames that look like little pine trees, and a mouse in a red-and-white striped Santa hat. Hanukkah is not the Jewish Christmas, it just happens to fall at the same time of year. Bringing Christmas imagery to a Hanukkah book is about as offensive to Jewish people as anything can be."
4,Great album!,"This album is great.I would just like to add the previous reviewer Donald mentioned another live album that is just one of my all time favorite live albums. It is called ""The Fightin' Side of Me"". It is a little tough to find though because it is on a double CD. If you search for ""Just Between the Two of Us"" you will see ""The Fightin'Side of Me"" which has ""Harold's Super Service"", ""Medley: Devil Woman, I'm Movin On, Folsom Prison Blues, Jackson, Orange Blossom Special, Love's Gonna Live Here"" ""T.B.Blues"" etc...It is truly an incredible album."
3,"Good dado head table insert, but not as good as a zero clearance insert","I bought this table insert for my TS300, mainly because I couldn't find any zero clearance inserts on the market made for my saw. The insert does decent, but there's still some tearing out. The insert also doesn't work well if you're trying to put a dado in a thin piece of stock, as the piece is not fully supported. Overall, I'd say it's good enough for the money spent (~ $10), and good enough for the saw you're working with as well (direct drive induction 15A motor)."
1,dado,"it was advertised as fitting a 10"" table saw...but not that it only fits 2 models...one of which is not mine"
1,Wrong size & unusable,Amazon sent me the wrong size insert (too short) and it doesn't seem worth the trouble to return it. The zero clearance insert that I ordered with it seems to be working fine.
3,Did not clean,"Did not work on older wheels. Might work better for newer wheels, not a restorer. Was looking for a product to clean 1996 Chevy wheels that were coated with grime."
3,Great design but a bit uncomfortable,"This is a great, trendy looking ring. The only drawback is that is fits very snug and is quite uncomfortable. I suggest ordering the next size up for comfort & correct fit. Otherwise, when you remove it at the end of the day, you'll have the imprint of the ring on your finger for several hours.I do get great compliments on this ring as it is very stylish and eye catching. I just wish it were a little more comfortable."
4,Sterling Silver Double Open Circle Ring,"I purchased this ring and it is beautiful. The information states that it is a size 7, and I usually wear a size 7 on my ring finger very easily. However this ring, felt tight on my ring finger. Other than that one small problem, its a classy and elegant looking ring."
3,"OK, but . . .","No problem with the product. But, be advised if you intend to use with a Dremel, you will likely need smaller than standard collets in order to hold the bits securely. Collet 483 should close enough to handle the smallest bit in this package."
1,Not what I expected,I have a lot of Tennessee Ernie Ford music and enjoy it. But this CD has too much talking in it and not enough singing. The samples I listened to did now show this.
5,JK from OK,"Timeless treasure... The ol' peapicker's voice is preserved with this CD. After listening, you realize how much you miss singers like Tennessee Ernie Ford."
4,Tennessee Ernie Fords Favorite Hymns,I liked the selections on this CD as they brought back some great moments in my early years when I attended church reguarly.
3,Old fashion,"While I grew up with this music, I was hoping for more pure song CD. Too long intros to the songs"
2,"Good Design, cheap parts used for production. Doesn't last.","I have purchased several of these adapters. I run my hose off of one side and the other feeds my drip irrigation systems.The unit is reliably safe to use for only ONE season.Parts that have failed:Interior ball valves:--over time won't shut completelyPlastic valve handles:--after a few months they become brittle and prone to break.Black ""rubber"" hose:--does not handle pressure. After a few weeks of use, when I turn off the valve at the end of the hose the black hose back on this unit starts to balloon. Eventually it fatigues and bursts.I like the design of this product but it seems that the use of cheap Chinese components have failed the designers. I expected more for my $20 purchase price."
1,It Comes With A 90 Day Warranty - They Really Stand Behind Their Products (NOT),I've had problems similar to other reviewers of this truly terrible hose adapter. Mine is less than a year old and both shutoffs froze (not from cold temps) and cannot be freed up. I've tried everything. If you need the flexibility of the 2 short rubber hose extensions that this comes with you would be better off making your own and adapting them to a brass hose splitter.This paperweight comes with a 90 day warranty. That tells you how much faith they have in this product.I've had similar poor experiences with Gilmour sprinklers - fortunately those are supported for life.Bosch owns Gilmour and Nelson and I generally find both Gilmour and Nelson homeowner products to be of inferior quality yet my Nelson Windfighter commercial grade sprinklers are troublefree.
1,Broke after 4 months of use,"I used this to create two outlets: a switchable garden hose outlet and one permanently connected to an automatic water timer. After 4 months of use, the crimp connection between the short hose and the male-threaded end failed under pressure on the automatic timer side. Fortunately a neighbor noticed the flooding after only a few hours. I would not trust this product in a situation where it is under pressure and you are not actively watching it."
1,"Looks good, but not!!",Water pressure caused flexible tubes to pop out of housing after a couple of weeks under constant pressure. Tubes can not be re-inserted. Buy brass y hookup.
1,Horrible construction.,Two months later it's dead as a doornail. Only buy this if you're getting by for a couple of months before you can afford a quality jumpbox.
2,This unit it will bleed you of cash on an ongoing basis,"It's borderline criminal how much ink this unit goes through, how much the ink costs, and how it's completely proprietary to canon.I never want to print anything and seldom do because it seems like I'm always stuffing ink cartridges in it.If you don't want to print much (hehe), it's a nice unit with all the features it has. Scanner works well. Fax works well but the receive modes are a little hard to figure out. Manual is fair."
4,happy with purchase,"I'm satisfied with the print quality of this device as well as it's professional look. It is very easy to use and the instructions -- while long and complex at times -- are easy to understand. This is a very large printer though, and I would advise you to take careful measurements of your desk space before purchasing to make sure it will fit. Overall highly recommended."
4,Where's my 50 dollar rebate people???,"I am a little disgruntled folks! Although the printer works fine, I can't say the same thing of the people who sold it to me. I have sent 2 emails previously about this little oversight for which I have still received no response. This printer advertised with a fifty dollar rebate certificate with no strings attached.(unlike the other one they offer if you buy a camera as well) I am very cautious about reading the fine print in everything that I ever do and I chose this one because it was the only one available with the fifty dollar rebate with no strings. I never received my rebate and neither the seller nor Amazon has done anything to resolve this issue. I would like my fifty dollars please or I will be forced to take my wifes and my business somewhere else.Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter!Houston out!"
4,satisfied customer,"I am a family medicine physician running a small rural clinic with three employees. This is my third printer. My Dell has been only barely adequate, and I had an MP730 that worked great until the printer mechanism literally fell apart--I ordered this one since I had been happy with the MP730, but that was just days before the printer rollers fell out of the machine.So far, the MP830 has matched it's big brother in ease of use and quality of documents as well as interface with my system.Not having read the instruction manual (does anyone?), I am still learning which buttons to press when, but I like the lcd display, even though it doesn't always tell me what to do next.Still learning, still evaluating, so far, so good.Would buy another at this point since I haven't seen anything else that does what this one does in one compact machine."
1,Breaks pretty quickly,"Works OK when it works. Cumbersome startup and scanning software. Seems to use a lot of ink. But I was OK with that until it broke less than two years after I bought it. Then I found that Canon's user manual and website were practically worthless (nothing about the error code I got, which it turns out is pretty common when you Google it). They haven't got many authorized repair shops. I drove 30 minutes each way to have mine repaired, at a cost of $125 -- $35 for a new purge tank, and $90 labor. In retrospect, that was stupid -- I could have had a new machine just like this one for $250 and saved myself two hours of driving and a week without a printer. I wish I knew a better all-in-one to recommend, but I switched to this Canon after a very poor experience with an HP. So all I can say is this one is nothing great."
1,A Defective sales Churner by Design - Don't buy a PIXMA,I've had my Canon Pixma for a couple of years now but an intermitent problem started to crop up that's continually getting worse.Shortly after my warranty ran out my once solid all in one system started having issues related to the ink cartridges. I continually get an error message telling me I have the wrong ink cartdridge in my printer when I know I don't.I've never bought anything but Canon ink cartridges so i KNOW my situation has nothing to do with defective toner.I'm of the opinion that Canon has simply made a product that has a technical glitch and is trying to churn additional sales by offering to repair the item at the owners expense or cross-sell them a refurbished/used system. I won't be buying another Canon Printer again.
1,Horrible printer - BAD customer service,"I've had this printer for a little over a year. While it has worked at times, other reviewers are correct that it is an ink hog and it also has many technical issues.My printer has had two bad print heads. I replaced the first one, then one day I turned on the printer and it says that ""the print head is incorrect."" If you are out of the warranty period the response from Canon ""customer service"" is to buy another print head. Basically, just keeping dumping more money into the faulty product.Also, if the print head if faulty, other non-printing functions (like scanning and faxing) will not work.Based on this product and rude customer service, I'll be staying away from Canon."
3,Ink Hog!,"I've owned this printer now for 2 months, having purchased it after my 2 year old Canon MP730 broke down. While I love the design and print quality of both printers, somehow Canon has managed to significantly increase the amount of ink you have to purchase on the newer model. For example, I've now replaced the large black cartridge [...] 4 times in 2 months. On the MP730, I doubt I replaced the regular size black cartridge [...] more than once every 3 months or so. I've actually never written an online review like this before, but have been so frustrated with the time and expense of replacing ink cartridges I felt compelled to warn other potential buyers. I personally will be looking for another printer for everyday use, and relegating this one to photos. This printer deserves 5 stars on quality and 1 star on ink useage."
2,Ink Hog,"I laid to rest my old HP All-in-One for the quicker MP830. Well, everything said in previous reviews is true including chugging ink. OH MY HEAVENS it goes thru ink like water off a ducks back. I had it 2 months and hardly had printed a thing on it and had to replace the ink. Now here I am only a couple of months later and now need to replace ALL THE INK. At this rate of buying ink at 15 bucks each and it needs 5 I could have purchased a color laser printer and still been ahead of the game."
4,Most Unreliable Product I Ever Purchased,"I bougth this product from Amazon and it failed after printing only 17 pages. Canon would only provide a reburbished unit as a replacement, so I sent it back to Amazon and received a replacement from them. The second printer has also now failed with error 6800. Both times the unit failed the display characters were only in Japanese and the printer would not repond to inputs of any kind in anyway what so ever. The time wasted and agravation experienced with this printer make it, in my mind, a very poor purchase for the money. Actually, even if the printer was only $50.00, given the problems I have had, I still wouldn't buy another one.After finally finding a printer that works, I have been using it without failure for 6 years. I have been very happy with the printer/scanner and use it frequently for multiple purposes, including as a fax."
5,Great upgrade,"This all in one printer has been fantastic. Every feature, including its numerous scanning and photo options work easily and flawlessly. I prefer this all in one to my previous HP all in one by a wide margin.My only complaint is that the ink cartidges are small capacity and run out reasonably quickly. Luckily the Canon ink is not hugely expensive, as the HP ink cartridges had been.This is one excellent product."
1,Not Networkable!,"For some reason Canon has not gotten with the program. Brother, HP and most of the other companies realize that a lot of people have home networks, and as a result people do not want an old-fashioned printer that needs an expensive print server to setup.It would be nice if Canon got this message as well since this printer is no good for networks when for the same price I can get an HP that does everything the MP830 does and can work wirelessly over a network. Also this Canon eats ink. If you plan on getting it you better get ready for frequent store runs."
1,Broke down after 2 years,"Despite being a gentle user, printer lasted a total of 23 months. Became a very heavy piece of junk as a problem with printing heads meant that the scanner and fax became unusable. No more MFP for me."
2,Too many technical issues,I'll keep it short and simple.Worked fine for awhile. Doesn't any more. Probably not going to get a Canon again.
1,Don't buy this one,"This printer uses ink at a level that cannot be overstated. After being frustrated with the enormous cost and waste associated with the ink usage, the printer stopped printing altogether.I updated firmware and all that nonsense. I have to say that the scanning and fax functions worked perfectly. It is just a bad printer. I know others have had issues as well. I would avoid this printer, there are better alternatives out there. I am using a Brother inkjet now that doesn't gobble ink and does the job just fine."
1,Problem Printer,"I bought the Canon Mp830 about 1 year ago and it worked well for the first 9 months BUT it used a ton of expensive color ink. At first I couldn't understand why my color ink cartridges were always running out when I mainly used it for B&W; faxes and copies. When I checked into it, I found that this printer doesn't use Black inck to print Black - it uses all the colored inks to make its own Black - at a huge cost to the poor owner that has to keep buying all the ridiculously expensive colored ink cartridges!Finally I got the dreaded Error 5010 that so many people have commented about and for which I can not seem to find a way to reset the machine. The good thing about this printer crashing is that it is saving me a huge amount of money on colored ink.Don't buy this printer. Don't buy a Canon."
1,Don't Buy This Machine!,"Buying this machine was a big mistake. It cuts off the edges of copies no matter where one places the document (on the platen, or on the automatic feeder). The fax machine goes on in middle of phone conversations, piercing the ears of the person on the other end of the phone call. It indicates low ink almost immediately after a new cartridge is inserted. This causes other functions to either not operate or adds another step in which you have to tell it to print even though it is ""low"" on ink. It gobbles expensive ink like there is no tomorrow. The print quality is good."
3,Consumables will kill your budget,"From a purely features standpoint, this has been an excellent printer. And unlike the three prior HP all-in-ones that I've owned, the document feeder has never broken. What I dislike about this printer is the ink consumption. In the past 3 months, I've not once made a color copy (there's a button specifically marked ""Black"" for B&W copies) nor have I made a color print. However, the ink from the yellow, magenta, and cyan cartridges is somehow being consumed. This may either be a sneaky way for Canon to drive sales for ink cartridges or I have a defective printer, which I doubt because my copies and print outs aren't colorized and aren't marred by colored ink blotches."
1,I'm ready to send it to recycling: it's an ink hog,"I can't put up with this machine any more. If one cartridge is low on ink, or at least the sensor says so, then the machine quits functioning. No black & white printing unless you run out to a store and buy the ink cartridge the machine says is out of ink, when really, there seems to be enough ink left in that cartridge to shake out into a trash basket and it looks like there's a ton of ink left in the so-called ""empty"" cartridge. Plenty of ink there, but apparently not enough for the low ink sensors. So Canon apparently wants to make its money on selling ink. One other thing about this machine: The instruction manual is not very helpful when things don't go right. You'll wind up figuring out what is wrong through trial and error. I wish I had waited to read the Amazon reviews more carefully before I bought this MP830. I regret buying it."
2,Do Not Buy This Printer,"Just 3 weeks after a warranty exchange for my original MP830, (jamed paper resulting in error code) this one through up error code 6500, which IMO is the kiss of death. Tech support was useless. Repair shop wants 65.00 just to look at it. No more Canon for me."
1,"No No, Think Twice","I was aware of many negative reviews about excessive ink consumption of this product but decided to make a purchase anyway because I believed in Canon quality and had an expectation of years of trouble free service.But 3 days ago it displayed a dreadful error code UA00 and stopped working completely after 1yr and 5mon of light mainly printing usage.I can live with a bad luck but not with a bad,out of warranty printer.If I drive 20 miles to the nearest Canon service center and pay $65, I will be able to decide what to do next. Whether throw it away or have it repaired."
2,Problematic,"I thought I had such a deal when I snapped up this multifunction printer. I've always been a Canon fan (cameras, camcorders, etc.). But this printer is horrible at photo printing, despite my lengthy attempts at tweaking its settings. It is no match for my Epson Stylus Photo R380 in that regard.The office-use functions work well, but this printer consumes vast amounts of very expensive ink. Even when printing or copying black and white documents, the color cartridges indicate they are using ink! I am looking at the newer HP models (which are wireless and have much less expensive ink) and hoping for a Black Friday sale to scoop one up and sell this printer on eBay. Boooooo, Canon!"
4,Nice printer! Does so much!,"I love the options I have on this printer but the ink is kind of expensive and not everything comes out perfectly straight just like any other printer I guess. But overall I have a lot more options, the printouts are beautiful and it makes things look very perfessional!"
2,slooooooooooooow as a copier,"I bought this until for its double-sided (non-color) copying ability. And it does that fairly well but it takes several minutes to scan and print each double-sided page (even in non-color mode)! As a general purpose copier, it is useless to me because of this. It does do color copying which could be an advantage if you need that. Did I mention that it's slow? slow slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow."
4,"As always, another great machine from Canon","Canon has consistently produced a durable printer. This machine does everything you could ask for. The only issue is they have come up with a way, via an electronic chip, to make it so you can only buy their ink. I am sure, given some time, that you will be able to buy some aftermarket inks at a reduced rate. Otherwise, a whole lot of machine for not a whole lot of money."
4,Canon Pixma 850,"Excellent all in one fax-scan-printer-copier. I share the unit between two macs, and had some initial difficulties setting up the wireless printing function. Otherwise, the printing is good, the fax is excellent, copier and scanner good. Really cleared a lot of space in the home office with the all-in-one printer. No regrets!"
1,No wireless AirPort Support! RIPOFF! Do NOT Buy!,"There is no documentation anywhere that says this monster will not work with an AirPort wireless base station. Tech Support said that it only supports Canon's $100 wireless server.And on top of it all, the main black ink cartridge stopped being recognized, even though it's only a week out of Canon's box and used to copy one page in that whole week!Not worth the wasted time.It will be painful to pack up this thing, but what a relief to return it!Warning to everyone: the ink holders are too shoddy and will cause headaches. Apple users: do not consider Canon machines at all. Move on."
1,Goes Through Ink Like Water & Fax Broke,After a month or so the fax broke down. Thinks something is jammed inside of it and it's not. And this is a major problem with all Canon printers I've ever encountered: they go through printer ink like water. This one has an excessive 5 ink cartridges which all run out at random intervals after a few week's worth of printing in our office. The ink cartridge you need is never at the local store so you have to order online from this place called the Ink Link which sends out cartridges with no chip so you have tape the chip to them to get them to work and I'd like to return this awful printer but I'd feel guilty for anyone that got stuck with it so now I'm going to throw it out the window.
1,major disappointment,I bought this to update an old HP. I was very impressed by the reviews. After unpacking it and loading up the software I went to print. It kept insisting that there was no paper in the machine. I removed the paper tray and turned the machine over to see if something was taped up; the hinges for the top of the unit became unhinged. I packed it up and sent it back.
2,Machine inoperable within 2 weeks of use!,"After only 2 weeks of using the Canon printer, it completely lost all power. I will not buy another Canon printer."
1,Not so all in one printer,"Ordered the Canon printer as a christmas gift for my girlfrined. When I received the printer, it was still in the original manufactures box that you would get from a office depot if you had bought it from the store. The box's outside was beat up, and generally trashed. Also it had rained that day, so when I got home from work I found the box at my front door and it was also wet. When Christmas came we tried it out, the fax machine part of the all in one printer did not work. After several attempts with the Canon service reps, we are supposedly getting a new printer in the mail. Hopefully it will not be received in a wet damaged box,and broken. Who's at fault for the broken printer? Is it Amazon, Canon, or UPS who delievered the printer???? You decide!"
1,Poor print quality--wastes ink,"In over 30 years as a computer user and software designer, this is the worst printer that I have ever owned. It uses 5 ink jet cartridges, and long before they are out of ink, the print quality diminishes drastically. Segments of symbols start to be skipped and the print becomes faded. You can either live with this or buy new cartridges even though the old ones are still more than half filled.A piece of junk."
4,"Best All In One for me, so far!","Awesome product! I had 2 HP 6210 All in one printers prior to the Canon. Both broke down right after the warranty was up.... HP didn't want to repair, and try to sell me on a new printer. The first time, I fell for it and got yet another HP. When it happened the second time, I told them they know what they can do with that printer.Anyway, the only thing I do not like about the Canon, is that every time you print you have to manually change the print settings to ""Fast Draft"" and ""Grayscale"" this save a lot of ink. I had the printer now for 3 months, and I print a lot of stuff, I have yet to change the ink cartridges.The software load very easy, i did not have any problems with it at all."
2,Great printer when it works,"The like everything about the printer/scanner/fax on the days that it works. The problem is that only works for a while and then it says that there are two ink tanks of the same color installed (which of course is not true). It won't let you print with this error. After trying to reset it in other ways I end up popping out the ink cartridge that it says is a duplicate and reinstalling it. That fixes the error every time...BUT the next error says you've installed a refilled ink cartridge and once again you can't print. Or it can't recognize the cartridge when you put it back in. The only solution I've found is to replace a 3/4 full ink cartridge with a new ink cartridge. That's not cheap, but cheaper than throwing a brand new printer out the window. I should also mention that I've only ever used Canon brand ink cartridges that are brand new. So, the printer is great if you don't have these problems, but are you willing to take that chance?"
1,Achilles Heel Ink Cartridges,"The ink cartridges are a real pain. Even when you use the gray scale (black&white;) mode color ink is used up! The cartridges have a chip on them so that you cannot use generic replacement cartridges without removing the chips from the Canon cartridges and then plugging them into the generic which is very tricky. Also the machine will not do anything if one of the ink cartridges is empty, not even scan! You are dead in the water.As previously said the cartridges are VERY expensive and you go through them quickly even using black and white. If you do any printing be prepared to pay. I am ordering a RIHAC ink tank so that I can run the the printer otherwise I would have to dump the thing."
4,Have an office in your home,"Excellent inkjet printer. Photos are very good. Everything you need for personal or a small business. Multiple ink cartridges save money. Only downfall is that duplex printing does not use the larger black ink cartridge, which is used for letters, but the smaller black ink cartridge used for pictures. Overall an excellent printer, fax, & copier."
2,"Great All-In-One, but it Drinks Expensive Ink","I purchased this printer because I wanted an All-In-One device that would still give me quality printing. The print quality is great and the fax, scanner, and copier are fine HOWEVER this printer drinks ink and it is EXPENSIVE ink. I can't find the ink at COSTCO , where I normally buy discount, and it seems unavaileable online for the most part. I already miss my old HP. This printer follows the Gillete shaver model. Give them a cheap holder and make a killing on the accessories (ink in this case)."
4,Home Office workhorse,"I have used this printer for almost a year, upgrading from the HP PSC 950. It is FAST, works very well, and uses ink about average amount. Be sure to have extra tanks on hand. Once you get a low ink message, you get about 4-5 days before you have to replace. Once ink runs out of 1 tank, printer will not function! I have purchased three 4-color packs from Amazon in the year I have used it. Photos are clear and crisp, love the multiple paper feed source where 4x6 or full size photo paper can be fed from lower compartment. The sheet feeder is great for copying several pages at a time but I haven't used it much. The card reader reads CF and SD quickly and reliably. The only downside is the size, but you gotta expect that from a multi-function printer."
2,"Ink expires with time, not usage","Although this multi-function printer produces good quality prints, it is not good enough to overcome a completely flawed ink cartridge design. If you installed new ink cartridges in January and printed 5 pictures, let the printer sit idle until July, you would have to replace the color cartridges all over again. Spending $50 for cartridges every 6 months, you'll quickly realize there are better alternatives out there.Before buying this we owned an HP deskjet color. My wife worked in publishing and would print thousands of pages off of one $15 cartridge. That is what I expect from a printer. Conversations with friends of mine confirm HP inkjet cartridges still last a very long time (i.e. years).We regret our purchase of this printer and will not purchase another Canon printer."
2,disappointed,"I've had this unit a little over a year, and it's the first Canon product that has failed to meet expectations. As others have noted, ink consumption is bad. Furthermore, it appears I need to do a major cleaning or replace the print head.Mac compatibility is OK, but not entirely as advertised unless you read the microscopic print. First, you can't save your settings. I would like to set duplex as default, but it never holds so I have to select it every time.Wireless printing requires the purchase of a Canon accessory. I tried connecting the printer to the USB port on my Airport Extreme, but the drivers don't support that mode. You can share it from another networked Mac - as long as the sharing Mac doesn't drop into sleep mode.I love my Canon digital cameras, and I hear the scanners are good. Guess they'll have to settle for 2 out of 3."
1,Complete piece of junk.....,"Since day 1 this printer has been nothing but problems...constantly calls for replacement color print cartridges, very slow to print, FAX doesn't work properly...I could go on and on about what a waste of money the MP830 was. Just read some of the many other one and two star reviews."
2,Good MFP... for 2 years,"Purchased this via Amazon in April of 2007. As of end of December 2009 - dead. Well, ok, it still turns on, but it doesnt do anything else. I got stuck in the Error code 5010 - which tells me that the scanner lock is on. After repeated and multiple troubleshooting steps, it's still non-functional. In the 20 months of use, it was great - good quality printing, even better scanning. Unfortunately, it's not great with Mac OSX - it works, but not like it should. Ink is expensive and goes quickly, but you get a good product. All in all - $270 for 20 months... was it worth it - no."
2,Ink Problem,"Printing, scanning is great. Copying is slow - for the unit is not really meant for it - for emergency copying only). But the main problem is the ink. The colored inks goes low even you print only in black. If one cartridge goes out of ink, the machine is useless. It is ""a must"" to replace it. Using all black cartridges does not do the trick. It will give a message something like ""not compatible color cartridge"". I remember that I had a canon before (12 years ago) and I had the same problem - the ink. That's the catch on why it's cheap. Canon should work on this area. Ink problem."
4,A good all round printer,"This printer is a good match to my needs, (light use) the only function we don't use is the Fax.I am pleased with the quality of the photo prints"
2,ink guzzler,I would not recommend this printer.Print quality is poor and the ink cartridges are expensive.
4,"Nice machine, but....","I am enjoying using this multifunction printer, but Canon support leaves much to be desired."
2,"piece of junk, nothing works if printer doesn't work","The MP830 turned out to be an expensive piece of junk. As I am not a heavy printer user, and although I have been warned by a colleague to use the inkjet from time to time so that the cartridges wouldn't dry up (which I did, but apparently not frequently enough), the printer stopped working, the unit produced an error (5200) each and every time I turned it on, and refused to do absolutely anything (faxing or scanning included) unless I fixed it (which is hard to do, the error wouldn't just go away after replacing the ink cartridges, and I am still jumping through hoops trying to do a deep cleaning of the print head). To say the least, it is very frustrating not to be able to send a fax or scan a document when only the operation of the printer is affected by the cartridges. Canon just lost a customer, this is simply bad engineering."
3,"Nice features, but an unreliable printer","This printer prints color very nicely (but slowly), and functions well as a copier, scanner and fax, but is not a reliable printer. Since I started using it two weeks ago, I've had more issues with it than I had for my old B&W laser jet that I had for several years. The printer doesn't show up in my computer, it is difficult to change settings...I pulled my old laser jet out of the car and hooked it back up. I'll keep this one for color copies and for scanning, but I'm giving up on it for day-to-day use."
4,"Prints fast, everything else is slow","Prints fast, great results, but everything else is slow. The selections on the printer's control panel lag and the motors for the ADF intake seem slow and labored. It's okay."
4,Nice printer!,"I really like this printer & have found it fairly easy to use. I had a little difficulty when faxing, but I had put the paper in the wrong tray. My only issue is with the manual - it can be hard to find what you need. It needs to be more user friendly."
1,Best To Stay Away From This Printer,"It's credentials make it seem like the perfect all-in-one,but it's real world capabilities will leave you frustrated. Lots of troubles getting it to perform properly. I am not very tech-savvy so I had our IT guy set it up and troubleshoot it and by the third call to him in one week, he said, ""get rid of it,"" so I did. Thank goodness Amazon has such a terrific return policy. I'd be sooooo angry if I had to keep this dog."
5,Coolest printer ever,"This is the coolest printer / fax machine / scanner ever. It worked perfectly out of the box. The coolest thing is the ink cartidges. It comes with individual cartridges for each color and they are see-through so you can see how much ink is left. Why didn't HP think of that? No more throwing out a whole cartridge because one color is gone. It prints on both sides too. The photos are perfect, which is a big bonus as I didn't want to have to keep a separate photo printer around."
2,good features but ink tank protection system is a real hassle,"I chose this machine because of the good feature set and generally good reviews, but I regret the purchase.The ink tanks are an almost constant problem. I'm using the original ink tanks that came with the machine, and most times when I turn the machine on it gives an error message, either that there are two ink tanks of the same color, or that it can't recognize one of the ink tanks. In either case, the machine will refuse to print or copy anything, even in black and white, until the error is cleared. That requires several iterations of remove/reinsert the ink tanks, and/or reboot the printer.Probably I would buy an HP machine if I could do it over. This one is way too much trouble."
3,Uses Lots of Ink & Not as Well Made as Previous Models,After 3 years and wearing out an MP730 I thought I would stick woth the Cannon brand. I have had the Pixma 830 for about 8 months now and have spent enough on ink to put a kid through college! The unit is already starting to squeek & make noise too! Not the quality of past printers! The scan funtion is far too complex also.If I had to do it again I would buy something else.Cat
5,great all in one,"I read all of the reviews before I purchased this all in one. I had no problem with it working with an answering machine. I contacted my phone company and got a special ring and set the all in one to recognize that ring....simple. It prints great,copies just as good, scans nicely, and even does photos with very good results. I am able to print my Quicken checks, both wallet and standard ( not possible on some HP printers or all in ones) The price is fair and the ink cartriges are always the most expensive on any of the ink jets. I love the Canon PIXMA MP 830 and the price at Amazon was the best price around! Thanks Amazon!!"
5,Awesome do everything printer,"Bought this as a home printer. Great printer that does all. Haven't tried faxing with it yet, but copies are so close to the original, you can't even tell the difference. It also prints great pictures."
5,Great printer,"I love this printer. I haven't used every feature yet, but I like the ones I have used a lot. It prints fast and the instructions are easy to follow. I would recommend this printer for anyone who goes to school, prints their own pictures, and/or has their own office."
4,Good Value,After reading various printer review this was the obvious choice and I have not been disappointed.
3,"Good All In One, but....","as other reviewers said this is a nice machine but its ink sucking habit is out of control!I bought this item about a year ago and am not happy to be spending a small fortune on ink. Plus, the 5 different ink cartridges run out at different times so this machine requires constant ""feeding"" to maintain operations.For the above cited reason, I am looking forward to a new and easy maintenance machine."
5,BETTER SNAP UP THE LAST ONES,"Used this printer for almost a year, and it is superb. According to one reviewer, they have cheapened up the scanner in the MP850, its successor, so I got perhaps the last one in town. It is reliable, reasonable on ink, fast, and does just about everything. The extra 830 I have will remain sealed until I run this one into the GROUND."
2,Broke in less than one year,This product worked great until ink started to leak onto everyting. Canon promised to ship out a replacement except they are backordered plus the 5 bussiness day shipping. So for a small company this is really inconvinient.
5,Couldn't be happier,"This printer lives up to and beyond my expectations. The scanner is very fast, as is the printing and copying. I love the media card reader as well. Photo printing could be slightly better (I wish this printer had 6 color printing instead of just 4), but otherwise it excels in every aspect.I replaced an aging scanner with ADF, Canon inkjet printer (everyday + photos), Epson inkjet printer (for printing CDs/DVDs) and an external USB card reader. What a space-savings!I'm even printing on CDs with this thing. Couldn't be happier!"
2,Great until the error codes started showing up!,"I have owned my Canon Pixma MP830 for two years now. Worked AMAZING! Until the error codes showed up, first there was 6A00 which in NOT in the book under problem solving error codes. Then error code 5100 started showing up. I called tech support who were great, except could not help me. They said the problem is in the circuit board and I could either buy a new one at their discount (they gave me a code that is good for two weeks) or pay to get it fixed and I would have to pay for the estimate to see what that would cost. SO my dilemma .... buy it again... or get something else. Lemon or Cherry... roll of the dice. But buying a new one every two years is not what I want to do!"
1,It's a Lemon,"There were problems with the unit from Day One. Ink cartridges weren't recognized and thus the unit could not operate. A call to tech support brought some replacement cartridges, but not the right ones. It required a second call and another week's wait to get the correct, working cartridges. Then the unit would not scan from the machine, although it scanned from the computer. Another 1 1/2 hours with tech support, and they couldn't get it to work, so suggested I take it in to one of their reps in another town. I thought about it overnight, and decided that I had a lemon on my hands, and shipped it back to Amazon. I had read positive reviews of this Canon product, but after this experience I decided to go with HP as a replacement."
4,Printer other than HP OfficeJet,"I decided to make a change in my choice of printer because my brand of choice was too expensive for the comperable features this unit had. I love therinter, however it's a little more expensive keeping up with replacement ink cartridges because I have not been able to find a recycle/refil place for the Canon ink cartridges. Functionally the unit is very easy to use and has not failed me once. I like its sleep feature so that I can leave it on 24/7 for faxes woithou waisting energy. I wish their software had a direct fax with coversheet option which was prtesent on the HP unit."
3,Good but beware...,"Nice little package, prints quickley and much quieter than my previous HP model. It looks good and has a menu driven screen. The issues I have with it are the OCR software which is basic at best, the on-screen controls don't work with IE 7 BUT more importantly this machine drinks ink like a Hummer drinks gasoline. Not a good choice if you print a lot."
1,BLACK HOLE FOR INK. total ripoff. should get a 0,Canon Pixma MP830 Office All-In-One Inkjet Printer (0583B002)This is the worst printer I have used in 25 years of computing. They have rigged it to mix color ink to produce black and white document. Anyone considering buying it should check out this url:[...]In spite of scores of hours on with tech. support I cannot get it to do the simplest tasks like linking a scan to an email or faxing. It uses up colored ink like a black hole even though I have not printed a single color document. When a colored ink is used up it will not function at all. it uses about $70 dollars worth of ink to print around 200 black and white pages. once the color ink is used up (which happens even if you are only printing b and w it stops working altogether and you have to replace 5 cartridges. i wish i could give it a 0. i hope that the company gets a class action law suit.
4,Good machine,"Overall, I bought it for the paper handling capability, which is a little better than the MP780. The only negative is that the ink cartridges are still very expensive and the generics are pretty much useless because of the chip transfer requirement, which is much to time consuming and clumsy for my taste. But then, that's why Canon did the chip thing on the cartridge in the first place, since there is no other reason other than to eliminate the competition for cartidges."
5,Grrrrrrreat,Quick printing great print qualityFast printing and scanning - copiesLove the dual paper feedsAll around GREAT machine.
4,Great printer,"We have just recently purchased this product about 3 weeks ago, so far it is working great. We haven't used the scan,copy or fax, however the printer is working great. I agree that it seems to be a bit of an ink hog, but we are looking into having it print only using the black ink instead of color. At this time it'seems the color is running out a lot faster than the black."
2,"was ok, as long as it worked",after a light use for over a year I started having a problem with this machine not being able to recognize the ink. (always used Cannon ink).this basically makes the unit completely useless.
5,Great printer/fax/copier/scanner/Picture printer,"Not only this printer does everything but it does it well.Easy to use and set-up, the printing is fast for an ink-jet and the quality is good. Pictures printing is amazingly good for the price of the printer.Ink consumption is very reasonnable when the use is mixed between office printing and pic printing. So far nothing wrong.Recommended"
5,Have owned ours for 4 years and its still going strong!,We got tired of buying cheap printers on sale for $79.99 only to have them die on us in 6-12 months. We stepped up our game and got serious about our printing needs. The representative at the store where we bought it suggested we buy a printer that was higher quality (twice the money) but that we would see longer lasting results. And we are so glad we did because remarkably we have!
1,Does Not Power Up Anymore???,"Literately i have only used this printer approximatley less than 10 times to print out basic stuff and to make a copy or two, i purchased it a couple of years ago, but it has just been sitting there most of the time, and the machine just died on me.Two days ago i was using my PC and i turned on the printer, and it did turn on just fine. About 20 minutes i began to print and windows said it was offline, then i went to this printer and it was turned OFF, i tried unplugging the power cord for 20 minutes with the same result, then i left it unplugged during the whole night and in the morning it was still dead. VERY disappointing!! I am hoping it is the power supply that is bad because i can buy that for around $40 dollars or so and it is very easy to replace. I was not expecting this from Canon.If anyone has information as to what the problem might be i will appreciate your input."
1,Look elsewhere!,"This has been the only printer I've ever owned that I've had problems with. It won't seem to accept documents from the Automatic Document Feeder (ADF).However, besides my own problems with it's functionality, it is horrible with ink. I can't say this enough. Not only does it have multiple (and non-refillable) cartridges, it somehow uses color ink even if you're printing a black document in the 'greyscale' setting. Finally once it's detected an empty cartridge, it won't let you do anything else until it's been replaced.Again, this thing sucks down ink, and wastes color ink even if you're printing in black. Even if they gave these printers away they'd make a killing off the ink.The engineers should be ashamed of themselves."
5,AI1,"I ordered this same item from ""A Matter Of Fax"". Their ad claimed brand new factory sealed. I received a repackaged and broken product that I had to return. Live and learn!I ordererd the item thru Amazon and received a brand new item just as advertised. The pixma 830 works great and I'm very satisfied with it. If you are looking for a great quality machine, this is it."
2,Reviews were too good to be true!,"Received this highly recommended printer. Was totally surprised that ink tank U150 could not be recognized. Spent the day trying to solve problem. Finally had it up and running, what a nice unit it was. Turned on printer and computer the next day and printer was down again, same ink tank problem. Went out and purchased two ink tanks, from two different office supply stores. None of these worked and spent another 1/2 day trying to fix. Called Canon (no luck)...........Need I say more!! Maybe just a lemon?"
2,More trouble than it's worth,"I've owned this all-in-one for a little over a year. Within the first week the display only displayed in japanese. Apparently this was a common defect as I later read while trying to trouble shoot the problem. Canon was great about promptly replacing the printer for free. Now just as the warranty has expired I'm getting an error that the print head is incorrect. I can't even scan documents as the whole machine does not function with an error. So, my experience has been that these printers last 1 week to 1 year. The cost to assess the problem at a Canon recommended place is $49 to look at it. And an additional 60 for one hour of labor plus parts. SO not worth it."
2,Good but the ink's VERY expensive,"I bought this about two years ago. Yes, it's good but the ink is frightfully expensive. Unless you really do a lot of color printing, you might want to shop around for cheaper options. Also, note that the ink expires 6 months from when you open it. So if you're a heavy color user, you'll enjoy this. If not, save your $$$ and get something else."
2,WARNING: Nice printer but uses ink at an alarming and expensive rate!,Great machine but very expensive to be buying ink every week. Most irritating is that the machine won't receive faxes if even one of the color ink cartridges runs out. This can hurt your business. if you buy this then make sure to buy lots of replacement cartridges.
4,Very nice small office machine,"With the amazing amount of technological advances made in just the last 5 years, I get a little paranoid when it comes time to purchase something. My expectations are extremely high and I hate to buy anything that leaves me disappointed.The MP830 is remarkable in every way. Before purchasing it I read countless user reviews and I appreciate all your input. Initially, I was looking at an HP but read some negative feedback about their document feeder, which is an important feature for me.Not only does this printer do what I expect well, it does so with exeptional print quality. I am even impressed by its print jet technology which lowers the cost of replacement ink wells.My only concern is when printing my return address from Microsoft Word on an envelope, I get occasional streaking. I get no streaks in any other print mode and this is tollerable as I usually use return labels anyway."
4,Great ADF scanner,"I bought this because i had more than 50,000 documents to scan and this machine has done beautifully. Never a serious problem at all. It does eat ink faster than i'd like and the color while printing pics is not great. I haven't figured out why the fax won't connect but i haven't messed with it much since i have another fax machine. So, if you need to batch scan tons of stuff, this is a GREAT machine. If you are looking to print high-color pics, this is not for you."
1,Disappointing Quality,"Have owned several Canon multifunction printers over the years and I'm afraid the MP830 was a real disappointment.First, quality control. In the last year, I am on my third unit. First one, the motherboard died and the unit was replaced under warranty. Second one, the paper feed jammed repeatedly. That unit was no longer under warranty and looks like I'll be on the hook for the cost of a new unit.But, it won't be a Canon.Other disappointment was the batch scanning function to a .pdf. With manual scanning, the images were clear and dark. However, in the batch scanning function, the images were very light, almost unreadable in some cases. Customer service admitted that this was a known problem with the software - but didn't know what Canon Japan would get around to fixing it.Overall, buy something else."
4,Why one needs to be an expert to use a Canon,"This is a beautiful machine, but I can't always find my way around it?"
3,2 times defect,"when I got by the first time, It's not working,so I replaced from Aamzon.Replacement it's quick,good service.But Canon MP830 make a noise sound whenI turn on.I know there is something wrong,but I am tired to do the replacement again, it's working thought.I think this product can't be ship by UPS,because UPS always throw the box to the floor. Now I just hate it because everytime I turn on the MP830, It make noise."
2,Piece of Junk!!!,My canon Multipass F50 was amazing. After 5 years I retired it and got the MP830. I use both machines for business. In the 2 years I've owned my mp830 I have had to have canon replace it twice becasue of error 5100. The machine simply does not work well. What a headache this has caused me. I will never buy canon again.
1,Worst Printer,"I have been using personal computers since 1982. This is unfortunately the worst and most unreliable printer that I have ever had. I am dissapointed as it was recommended by consumer reports. We have had problems with the scanner, the fax, and it devours cartriages even when you are printing in black. We are very dissapointed. I would see it, but I would not want to stick someone with it unless I had given prior disclosure."
3,Canon Pixma 830,Unit has many nice features. Only criticism is light color of early copies. Have had machine one month
4,Good Printer Questionable Build Quality,After two weeks of very little use the scanner stopped working. Cannon provided outstanding e-mail based tech-support. Unfortunately no fix. They are providing an express warranty exchange. I will be getting a refurbished printer in the next day or two. I hope that this one will hold up better under normal use.
1,very disappointed,I just set up my new MP830 and when I got to the point of setting up the fax I was angred and disappointed. I am used to receiving all my faxes directly to the computer.This machine does not support receiving faxes to the computer so it's fax function is of little use to me.Every received fax must be printed then scanned into the computer - what a waste of ink & time. My last multifunction would automatically store both received and sent faxes. If I didn't want them they would disappear at the click of my mouse.A whopping big No Thanks from me.
2,Its back in the box where it belongs,"This machine is too fancy and expensive for what it can do. Ink is too expensive. The software package is not too great. You can't receive faxes via your computer and view prior to printing. I get a lot of junk ad faxes at night. I'd come in to work and find a bunch of wasted paper and ink (expensive ink) from junk faxes. I finally boxed this printer up and put it in storage. I replaced it with a Brother all-in-one, which does everything and more, including PC fax receiving and sending, for much less money. Also, the Brother takes off-brand ink cartridges, which only cost about 3-4 a piece! And they work as good as the name brand cartridges. I own several other Canon products in which I am well pleased, but not this one."
1,"scan from panel doesn't work, tech support said it's Micro$soft's problem","The print functions work fine, both color and text. It will scan from software, but it won't respond to scan requests from the control panel, which is the main reason I bought it. Thankfully, I did not waste money having this boat anchor shipped to me, I'll just dump it off back at the store. I put a call in to tech support and he walked me through some tests, then gave up and said there must be something wrong with my pc. I tried installing the software on 2 different pc's: 1 2003 server, the other xp pro sp2, neither one allowed one touch scanning. In fact the xp machine didn't recognize the device at all."
4,I couldn't be happier,"I could not be happier with my PIXMA MP830 all in one printer. It prints great and faxing is so easy. If I had to name one thing that I was not totally happy with, it would be that sometimes the paper gets stuck in the printer when I am using the automatic document feeder. I use 24lb paper so this does not happen very often. Otherwise, I LOVE IT!!"
3,INK MUNCHER,This printer does decent quality photos but eats up ink like no other! The ink is also pricey. BEWARE OF THE INK MUNCHER!
3,Definite ink hog,"This all-in-one printer has been handy to have, but as others have noted it goes through ink inordinately fast. As many people know, the ink cartridges that come with printers are not full, so ink replacement will be necessary shortly after purchase depending on your use. What galls me is that the printer uses color ink even when I manually specify grey scale printing for every print job. To me, this is B.S.: there's no reason why black and white printing should use color ink, but it does. I've been happy with the printer's performance, but not with its excessive use of ink."
4,Good printer,"Easy installation and has been a good performer. Need to be careful when installing the ink cartridges otherwise you can easily damage the printer. Also, the lack of network connectivity is a drag."
3,Pleased with reservation!,"The Pixma MP830 is a terrific printer. It does everything well though the color photo printing capability leaves a bit to be desired if you're as picky as I.The bigest criticisms I have is that it is exceptionally noisey, even when run in ""quiet mode"" and it does not have the ability to receive faxes directly to your computer, implied but not clearly stated in the advertising. You have to scan them in from hard copy."
1,"Didn't track, frayed on the sides","I purchased these belts becuase they were less expensive than the 3M brand belts. Big mistake. These belts would not track on my Dewalt belt sander. After I scrapped several belts, I thought there was something wrong with my sander. I placed a 3M belt back on the sander and had no problems.Because they would not track, the edges frayed quickly which started to damage the surface I was sanding.One positive note was that the abrasive media seemed to hold up reasonably well for the short time the belts held together."
2,alright,"this is the kind of book my mom calls ""really good."" it's okay for reading something not much different than a news article. the story itself is sad and frightening, giving a warning to all people with regard to knowing who they are getting involved with. i still feel that if it was an hour special on dateline, it would have evoked more emotion than the way this was written. an alright book for content, mediocre on writing."
1,Second hand is loud enough to wake the dead!,"Every time the second hand advances (i.e. once a second), it makes a bang that is loud enough to wake the dead! Don't buy this, unless you're deaf."
5,A Story That is Never Forgotten,"I'm currently a Junior in High School and I've been singing the song in the book for the past week. I haven't read it since 2nd grade! I loved this story then and I love it now. It's a terrific story with wonderful illustrations. I'll never forget Cinnamon and how much she reminded me of, well, me."
2,little new here,"I suspect most who are interested in foreign/military affairs will find little new in this book. Except for specific information about certain weapon systems and associated terminology, most of the information here would already be known to readers who follow events like the Afghan war. One exception for me was to learn why our Afghan 'allies' so often seemed to let us down. Friedman points out that it was a coalition, not an alliance, whose partners had different viewpoints and goals. In a society whose three main ethics are honor, revenge, and hospitality it makes more sense to give a defeated enemy mercy and change sides when necessary. Otherwise, you invite unnecessary vengeance. There is little analysis here, mainly just a chronological recitation of events. For those who didn't already know, there is a good summation of the history radical Islam, Osama, et al. This material is better covered elsewhere."
3,"Oh, the Places You Can Go.","The main character of this book is a giant Super Bus. The bus travels around from place to place going to several different destinations. In doing so, the book broadens children's horizons and introduces them to the world at large. Kids love looking at Super Bus."
2,Downhill from here,"I am a huge fan of both the rurouni kenshin anime and manga, so its quite a dissapointment to see what becomes of the anime. After the shougo arc, kenshin struggles with people he should have no trouble with(guys weaker than shishio). Everyone got dumber(look at sanosuke) and weaker(yahiko is able to immitate Ryutsuisen against henya, but he's useless against some of the foes from here on.) It bothers me because of what could have been, looking at the manga. If you want to see what really happens, check out the Rurouni Kenshin graphic novels. Buy this only if you want to complete your ruroken collection only."
3,Crazy and offbeat,A young Keanu is definitely wacky and the older woman he supposedly loves is miscast in her part. There is no believability in the chemical attraction! Keanu kidnaps his Dad to get money but the whole plan backfires! Everyone in the family is a little offbeat. Watch this only if you are an avid Keanu fan!Marilyn in FL
3,Young wacky and crazy Keanu,An offbeat film with offbeat characters. Keanu is fun but the older woman he has an affair with was definitely miscast. There is no believability in the chemical attraction there. Keanu kidnaps his Dad for money but his plan backfires. The whole family is offbeat and a little wacky. Watch only if you're a Keanu fan.Marilyn in Florida
3,"Not a great film, but Keanu Reeves is always fun to see!","I thought this was really cute movie. Keanu plays a young man having an affair with an older woman. I thought their relationship was very sweet. The odd couple kidnap Keanu's Dad for the ransom money...except his Mom doesn't want the Dad back because she is having an affair! This is really an offbeat kind of film, which is what makes it so enjoyable. Nothing spectacular, but worth the effort. Extra bonus if you are a Keanu fan. He looks adorable in it!"
1,"I agree with the ""Naysayers""","The naysayers here are correct. Opening yourself indiscriminately to astral entities, which is what these instruments do, is not a good idea. A New Age Pollyanna attitude about good intent will get you loaded down with all sorts of spirits posing as angels, guides and the like. Unless this board is charged with some sort of anti-baddies magick, there are no guarantees about what you will contact. This doesn't mean you won't attract benevolence, but unless you are a well-experienced practitioner of the hidden arts, you might not wanna play! If you are ever going to approach anything naively, don't let it be this. No insults intended, just hoping my words will make a strong impression and save a lot of future grief and suffering! It could take a long time before you notice your life starting to go down-hill!"
2,Don't let it fool you,"People this is a ouija board. Its just dressed up in pretty colors and angel pictures instead of the usual plain wood and ominous occult symbols to appeal to those who are scared of the ""evil"" ouija. Other than that there is no difference."
3,It is a genuine Microsoft brand.,"It has the microsoft sticker to prove its genuine.My only problem with the actual product is the speaker for listening to other people is definitely not all that great. I had its volume at max and it still sounded pretty bad. As for the microphone, i have no clue as to how good that is.I guess its worth the money as it properly functions.I am basically using it till I can afford a better one."
3,its a hit or miss if they work,will i got to of this i got two types one workt one did not so its a hit or miss on what you get
4,It's ok...,"I'm not saying the seller put expectations too high; the seller did their job fantastically. Receiving the item from the mail was a breeze (it came in a padded envelope). It works, it's not damaged. The Amazon review page asked me how fun the game was. Well, since this is an accessory, I said it wasn't very fun at all. And the overall game rating is one star short of perfect. I do want to be clear, though - My issue is with Xbox, not this seller. The seller provided me the headset with no issues at all. I just don't like how Microsoft makes such low-grade accessories for their top of the line equipment.Again, I'm happy with the seller, not happy with the manufacturer."
4,Does the trick,"Not much needs to be said about this headset. It is the same as the original that came with the 360. It works the same which is good. Yes, I would love to have a $100+ nice wireless headset but this does the trick just fine. :)"
1,"Clearly Refurbished, Not Worth the Cheap Price","Not only was the headset clearly a refurbished launch unit, it was a poorly refurbished one at that. Straight out of the box (sorry, bag) the headband was warped. A little twisting fixed that. What could not be fixed is the very obvious loose wire inside the unit. If anything touches the cable horrible feedback is produced. In fact, horrible feedback is produced if any of the following conditions are met:- The wire is touched.- The wire is moved.- The microphone is muted.- The controller is moved.- The controller is not held at a steady 90 degree angle.It seems that everyone who orders this is getting a different unit (all probably sent by the private address on the label). So unless you feel like playing refurbished roulette: DO. NOT. BUY."
5,Good Product,"its not a game.... but its a good product, i think the white headsets are made better than the black dnt know why, but good stuff. Worth buy if you need repalcement"
2,cheap,"The headset I received didn't work. These particular headsets (at least with my experience in the past) run a high risk of not working. I have had some that work, but they break pretty easily as well. Go with something less cheap."
5,"Fast shipping, working product.",I am very pleased with these. they shipped fast and feel brand new. perfect pricing and with prime every things better.
4,works just fine,this product works fine for me no flaws nothing seems wrong with it at all but one thingwas when i ordered the mic i thought it was going to be the new type but it wasntit was the old kind with the bulky jack.i didnt really mind it that much but its all good
1,What a bad model,"I bought this mic because the one that came with my elite broke after 2 years. I bought 7 of these and they still don't work. How is that possible? Well if you touch the connector at the bottom of the controller it goes out, or the mic just stops working. I liked the original one with a solid base at the bottom of the controller, but I can't find that anywhere. I might just save so I can get the poofy surround sound ones."
2,waste of money,"I am giving the Microsoft Headset a 2 star rating, only because I have owned 4 of them since this year. Every headset I have had has stopped working. The mic will short out, the chord is WAY to skinny (to easy to get bent and not work).I would suggest saving your money for a wireless headset (something like the X3). I have 5.1 dolby surround sound pumping through my ears at all times..I can even hear bullet shells drop on Halo 3.This is a good ""spare"" headset. If you treat it gingerly, it may last you a year.But for someone who has kids and other people playing on my 360, I would suggest getting a different brand. If you don't want to drop the $ on some wireless headsets, you could always go the off brand route. I find those headsets are actually quite sturdier."
2,Not So Good,"This is the new revision of the official Microsoft headset for the Xbox 360.They made one change to the product, moving the mute button and volume control from a little dongle thats was part of the plug to an in line system, which i find hard to try and fumble for when im gaming.The pick up on the microphone is just bad, you practically have to put the damn thing in your mouth for people to hear you all the time, my friends are constantly asking if I am still there, which is really annoying."
2,Not an improvement over the older version,"I have had my XBox 360 for over 2 years and like most people I have back ground noise in my house that is undesirable to the rest of the world (barking dog, barking wife and kids, etc). The older version of the headset had the mute switch located on your hand controller and could be switched with no effort at all - seriously, simpler than hitting the ""X"" button. Anyway, now Microsoft fixes the previous headset and locates the mute switch some 12"" from the controller somewhere near my adams apple or whatever - not sure the brilliance with this or how this was supposed to help the gaming experience, guess I am not as smart as the richest man in the world. Anyhow, so with the unit I now leave my mike muted all the time as I don't have time in most games to hunt for the switch dangling from my earpiece. This is my same issue the the wireless headsets but save that for another review. Enjoy."
4,Worth the money for online FPS's.,"It's pretty comfortable, pretty high quality, and is decently loud. Fine for communicating in games that require it. If the game doesn't use it much, though, you don't need it at all."
2,Xbox Junk,Most of you that own the Xbox 360 know that it and its peripherals will break 100% of the time at one point or another. The communicator is no exception. We just keep buying replacements. Time to stop. Shame Microsoft. You really can do better.
2,It's ok...,"The price on this should be around $5. The quality isn't very good, you're better off looking for any headset / mic combo instead of using this product because of the proprietary connection."
2,A tip of me,Guys let me give you a tip k? buy wireless headsets I know they cost 100 bucks BUT! they never break (i fell once and still works fine!) it is wireless so you can leave and make sandwiches and still talk without the wire all full of jelly! lol its overall fun and makes it much better and the soud is clear and great i have one and it rocks!
2,Do Not Buy,"This headset is not that great. I have gone through two of them so far only because it stops working after a while. The wire bends way to easily, and you will soon have to twitch the cord around until it eventually stops working. Yes, it is cheap, but you are better off paying for a better headset even if it cost more money."
2,"Good, but certainly doesn't last","It's good, but it's really not reliable. I used this headset that came with my bought 360 for around 6-7 months, then it started to crap out on me. the plug-in became flakey, and then it became unusable. Soon after the first one died, I bought a second realizing the metal 'joint' sticking out of it snapped. The replacement didn't last four months or so before it started crapping out on me yet again. The 'joint' didn't even come off and it still 'died'. I'm gonna look for something else this time that will hopefully last at least a year... lol"
2,Not bad,"Until it doesn't work. It came with my 360 that I bought about 2 or 3 months ago. It was okay, it did it's job until the thing just finally gave out. Wouldn't recommend buying one."
2,A mixed bag of opinions,"On the one hand, this head set lets u talk on xbox live and has ok sound to it. On the other hand, it is made of junky plastic and doesn't fit my head well at all. I have broken it already and i had to duct tape it back together and it doesn't fit any better on my head. The cord is way to short and over all, microsoft has really cheaped out on this head set and it is a big shame."
2,Very easy to break.,"This heaset is built extremely poorly. I've gone through two of them and I took good care of both. It started acting up and my friends were complaining about a strange sound coming out on their end. Soon afterward they couldn't hear me at all. However, I could still hear them fine.The headset works fine when it actually physically WORKS, but these break far too easily. I think my next purchase will be for a different Xbox LIVE headset."
2,I liked the original xbox headests,"Yeah I guess you could actually lay back on your Lazyboy without the headset interfering and you can control the volume, but the problem is the volume itself! I play Halo 2 live and it's annoying when you are in a game where grenades and rifles are going off and you can't hear your teamates at all! There are also the occasional teamates who talk with no enthusiasm, so it's basically impossible to hear them with any TV volume! I had to rip off the ear piece coushin just to be able to hear a tiny bit better. It's not that my headset is defective either. I bought another one of these headsets thinking that it was in fact defective, but the same problem happened. All of my friends who own an Xbox 360 agrees with me in that these headsets aren't good."
1,Not for use with Halo 2!!,"Read what others have wrote, do not use this headset for Halo 2! You won't be able to hear anyone talk that well. Go with the x30 for the best sound."
1,Weak wiring,This wired headset for the xbox 360 has a delicate wire which is not up to the abuse it can be expected to take from kids. The wires inside break too easily and then can no longer hear or be heard.
1,trash! bad design and quality,"First of all, Microsoft should fire whoever designed this thing. Its is the most unpractical headset ever. I have a friend and she hates it. It messes up her hair everytime she comes over to play and has to use it. The first headset for Xbox live rocked. The sizing sucks. Overall a bad headset. gosh...who designs over the head sets anymore. makes you look like a dork!"
1,breaks too easily,"Although the sound quality and style aren't great, they're just the tip of the ice-berg when it comes to this headsets problems. The headset just breaks with normal use, period. A lot of the people I play with on XBox live have been complaining about their 360 headsets breaking, but I just assumed they weren't taking care of them. However, after using the headset for a few months, it just unexplicably stopped working.Since most of us are going to be using this system for several years at least, a headset that just stops working every few months is a major problem. So, it's time to look for third party headsets!"
1,Junk...most any 2.5mm headset will work though.,"This is the headset that comes packaged with the console...it is junk and inevitable needs to be replaced. I found that most any 2.5mm headset will do. Currently I'm happily using a headset packaged for use with a wireless phone purchased at the local discount retailer for about $5. Whatever you do, don't buy another one of these..."
2,Not really worth your $20.,"I had one because my Xbox 360 came with one. It worked for a while, but considering how well I take care of my things, I didn't expect it to suddenly stop working. It's cheap and not very comfortable. I preferred the original Xbox headset that went around the back of the head. I also never had a problem with that one. It lasted as long as I needed it to. I would suggest using this until it breaks, and it will, then move on to something else. Perhaps the wireless headset. You can't really play online without some sort of headset."
2,It works but the price?!?,"It works fine. I have had no problems with the sound though there is a slight static sound when the volume is turned up. This is normal with most voice communication products for video games.It should cost $5 AT MOST. Just picking it up will make you realize how cheap it was to construct. Also, there is no alternative besides the wireless earpiece (which I have heard bad things about though I have not used one personally)."
2,Cheap Crap,"Ok, I thought my old Xbox headsets were cheap, because they always broke where the little clip by the speaker attached to the wrap around head thing-thing. But at least the old headsets stood up to being superglued repeatedly, and I never lost sound or mic. I have had two of the new headsets, and they both have stopped working, I can hear my team, but my team cant hear me. I have decided to use my old, super-glued and duck-taped, original Xbox headset, and it works perfect, with the exception of the volume control.BUT, I plan to take on a project this weekend, and I will be hard-wiring my old Xbox headset into the new headset communicator. If anyone else is interested, the instructions are herehttp://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/9860/How-to-Use-Any-Headset-With-the-Xbox-360-Communicator/and this method works with any headset that worked with teh original Xbox."
3,eh...,"A headset is a must have for any 360 online game. You'll find it hard to get anyone on your friends list without one, but you really don't need THIS headset.I agree that the Official headset isn't the greatest, and some people might not take the best of care with them, but I can say that there are 3 of them in my apartment, 2 are almost a year old, and they're all as good as the day they were purchased. You just have to realize that they aren't very durable and treat them as such.If you do go the route of a third party headset (any cell phone headset will do), I highly suggest that you get one with an in-line volume control and try to get one with a mute. If you don't get an in-line volume control you may have problems with things being too quiet."
2,Problems with microphone,"Don't get me wrong about this product: it was very comfortable and accessible when connected to the Xbox 360 controller.However, the one, I received had problems picking up my voice unless it was directly over/on my mouth.The volume was not that loud to me, but I have a bit of hearing loss so it might be different for normal hearing ears.The microphone can pull a full 180 degrees so the headset can be placed on either ear.The headset placement and comfort overall was great but the sensitivity of the actual microphone was poor."
3,you get what you pay for!,"I buy several of these whenever I find a deal on them at amazon. They're great for emergencies, like when my 12 and 13 year old boys break their ""good"" ones or when they have friends over who didn't bring theirs."
1,faulty,"My order arrived fast, I was excited, and plugged the headset in, but other players could not hear me. I contacted the seller, and they quickly sent me a new one that was ""guaranteed to allow other players to hear me"" they did not lie, but now, I could not hear other players through the headset. After two bad items, Im going with a better headset"
5,i dont know what their problem is.,"there is nothing wrong with this headset. it only has one earpiece because ALL HEADSETS HAVE ONE EARPIECE. that one earpiece is so that you can hear people talking over the mics and the speakes that are playing the games soundtrack/sound effects. it wont break unless you do something stupid like step on it or twist it when you are mad at the game. people expect headsets to be made to withstand a small explosion but honestly, it SITS ON YOUR HEAD. what could go wrong up there? in all my years of playing online games with a headset, i have replaced one once becuase i was careless and let my cat chew up the wire. but that was MY FAULT and i accept that instead of blaming the quality of the headset. if anything, these things are too quiet, but you can turn up the headset volume in most games, so it snt a problem."
1,Do you like to put crap on your head?,"Because if you do, this is the product for you.I would rate this at zero stars if it were possible.This headset defines exactly what you don't want in a headset. You can't hear anything; Other people can't hear you. The headset is poorly made. How can the original xbox's headset be so much better than this? Do not buy this product. Anything else would be better than this."
4,Good Headset overall,"Not the most heavy duty of accessories, but easily one of the most essential to the online gamer. Sound Quality is great, hardly any feedback from other players (unless they are cranking music or sitting by floor fans).I have to replace mine though, for the same reason I keep buying headphones for my iPod/Zune player. Wiring in the cord has finally went out on my headset, meaning I can talk in games but I cannot listen by way of the speaker on the headset.I still hope for the day I find a headphone type product that can withstand over a year to two years of having the cord move around without the wires inside snapping or losing connection.Great headset overall, much improved from Microsoft's old Xbox headset, only drawback is I have to pay about Twenty Dollars every 15 months because of an age old problem."
4,good headset,I like this headset much more than the cheap original x box one that broke if you looked at it wrong. I have had no probs with this one and it works great and is actually very comfortable to wear.
2,Help! I need ammo at position kshpsh mmmm pshtsh...,"Yeah.. everything eventually works out just like my subject line.. anyone who owns these headsets for at least 3 months begins to realize that every 3 months they're buying a new one.. This is a bit of a waste of money but if you listen to people on live these days, you begin to realize the magnitude of how crappy these headsets really are.. way too many people are having headset issues and the noises that you hear from it are fascinatingly annoying..when you take apart the headset, as a layman, you still can't tell that there are any bad wiring issues because EVERYTHING is still connected yet nothing seems to work!! wayy to go microsoft!! woohoo.. you found YET ANOTHER WAY to mass produce bugged items and assure the repurchase of them.. what are these things?? freakin light bulbs?? gimme a break.. you have your mansion in the hills.. now make my 20 bucks and my sanity worth a damn.-Mace"
1,I thought i was unlucky,"So i got the bundle pack for the 360, and the headset along with it... the communicator worked great and there was never a prolem with talking or listening, and then one day i noticed that not many people were talkative. i could be heard but i couldnt hear them. i thought that i was one of the unlucky few who had a faulty headset, i guess i was wrong. there seems to be alot of problems with this headset so i'm currently looking for a headset from radio shack or something that could do the same thing without any problemssorry but having people communicate to me through shooting letters onto the wall using the bullet holes is not a very civilized form of communication"
2,Not as advertised.,"I was expecting a headset that had the mute/volume control to be on the actual controller, not a separate piece that was just inline with the cord. Luckily it was very cheap and I will still keep it just as a backup."
3,old style headset,"It works as you would expect. it's the old style with the puck that plugs in to the controller. No surprises, it works about as well as it did when it came with the xbox, crackles a little but for the price who cares.."
3,Works great,"Had tons of fun using this, especially playing l4d and l4d2 online. way intense. The product was brand new and worked great. The only problem I had was with the shipping. The shipping was slow, but other then that no problems."
3,Gets the job done,It's not a mic that will blow your mind away .. But for the price it gets the job done ! With proper care it should last you awhile ... You can hear everyone and everything properly ... Fast shipping ! Great product
2,This is the OLD version of the XBOX headset,Just a heads up to other customers. This is the old version of the headset which has an audio connector that is not compatible with the modern qwerty keyboard for the XBOX controller. The connector is not shown in any of the pictures so you might miss that point. While this isn't a deal breaker I would definitely rather have the more recent revision of the XBOX headset.
1,Different headset than advertised.,"This was supposed to be the newer headset with the volume control halfway down the wire, but instead I got the on with the big plug at the end, so now I can't use my chat pad."
1,headsets for the 360 all around suck,yea the headset sucks ive had a 360 for 3 months and have had about 5 of them yea there good when your talking and thats about the best feature they break easy and if u drop one just right it stops working its probably the best 1 but buy like 5 of them when your buying 1 so your not stuck in a game without a headset swearing because someone runs infront of you and you shoot them
2,360 headsets a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"Ok, we have both the XBOX 360 set and a Plantronics set that we used with our wireless controllers for about, oh, maybe one week after the 30day warranty before they both crapped out. They are definitely of much less quality than the Playstation sets that still work after more than a year of solid use. We have friends who have had the same frustrating experience, which is a shame, since the 360 wireless controllers work great and the game system itself is totally awesome. You'd think Microsoft and even 3rd party companies could have put out headsets of equal quality. I highly recommend you try some other 3rd party headsets first. If you have the 360 set that sometimes comes with the game for free, then try being very VERY gentle with the wire connections on either end (the headset and plug ends) - don't wind the cord up etc. - and maybe they'll last for you a little longer than a month."
2,Doesn't last long,My daugher loves the mic. She like to talk to people on xbox live. Her mic is about to broke. This mic doesn't last for a year. You should get a wireless mic.
1,X-Box 360 Communicator,This guy sent me the same broken product twice. First I could only hear through the TV. Now I can hear fine but they can't hear me. I bought a Microsoft Version of the X-Box 360 communicator and got a generic piece of crap. I would never buy from this idiot again.
2,Cheap,"People dont hear you well, lots of noise, uncomfortable, moves around while gaming, short cord, cheap feel. Why would they make such a product??"
2,Neccesary but Horrible,"A headset is almost always neccesary for any game on the xbox 360 but they are cheap and break WAY too easily, I had one and I acciedntly dropped it maybe 2 feet off the ground on wood floor and it snapped in 2! Even though they help you talk to friends thye are just not worth it. For some reason sometimes if i have it in it will turn off by itself, now i see why they are only worth six dollars, I have had to buy 4 because they break almost every couple of months..."
1,Very fragile. Lasted 4 months before wire came off inside,"They make these fragile for a reason, so that you will keep buying them. The wires and soldering are so poorly done inside that it won't take much before you throw them to the trash."
3,This is a good product,"This is a great product. I don't think it is as good as the wireless one microsoft makes, but I use it if my wireless battery dies (the bad thing about wireless). But overall it is a good product."
1,Doesn't work...well.,"The headset arrived on time, and it looked new itself, despite not coming in any sort of sealed packaging, which already tells me ""not new"". But the problem is, IT WORKS LIKE CRAP. The sound is choppy, it cuts in and out, it only connects well to my controller if I tape it into so there's pressure keeping it in. Thanks for a crappy product guys."
2,They need to upgrade,"I remember when I first got my Xbox it came with a set of these. I didn't have live so I didn't use them for a few months. When my buddy got live I decided to bring my headset over to his house and talk smack to our opposition/teamates on COD (of course). When I finally went to use them they didn't even work! Imagine that, the set broke before I even used them! I guess you can concider the low price they're going for weighs out their bad quality, but it might be better to invest in a nice set."
2,sucks,this headset came with my xbox 360. At first i thought it was good but then it was total down fall if came apart and had many gliches i stil use it today becaus i did not wasnt to waste my money on my 360
3,Really shoddy product,"I give the headset 3 stars because when it works, it is great. However, its a matter of when/if the sucker will work that is the issue. The new ""inline volume"" models are even worse than the original ones that had the volume control on the plug on the controller end.If/when it works, the sound is clear and the microphone picks up well (note to all you mouth-breathers out there!) Its just so frustrating to be unable to speak to your teammates. I would recommend a third party headset, as even the official wireless headsets have issues."
1,Stopped working after only a few weeks,"Did not arrive in original packaging. It only worked a few weeks, then broke. The microphone stopped working. You could hear other players but they could not hear you."
3,Does its job,"For gamers that are not quite that competitive this headset is a great companion. Although the quality of the mic is not as great as the gaming headsets available, it still gets the job done. The only problem i would have with the headphone is the durability of the product. The connection between the jack and the controller eventually becomes loose and therefore makes the headset impossible to use. I have already gone through 3 headphones before switching to a gaming rig.Overall i would recommend this product for people that are not that committed to video games but still want to have a fun time with friends."
1,Piece of Crap,i got this headset for christmas and it lasted 2 1/2 months until it broke. i have already gone through 2. im getting a wireless one. i suggest a wireless headset or a Turtle Beach headset
3,"Not bad, but not really good","The headset if quite uncomfortable and even turned all the way up they are a a bit quiet. It is nice being able to converse while you mess around on your xbox. It might have been easier if it had 2 earphones, and run ALL audio through them, including the game/console audio.I wonder if you can get any headset that uses 1/8"" shank?"
1,low quality stuff,"very low quality, there is even no pack except a plastic bag. Though this stuff is very cheap, the quality should not be so low. disappointed!!"
4,Gaming Headset,I bought this item for my Xbox 360 Slim a very cheap price and I wasn't disappointing but satisfied. Surly this is not a hardcore gaming headset but it gets the job done. I would recommend this for a person who is just starting on Xbox Live or just got their Xbox. The only problem i had with this is that when you turn your TV volume high it is a little hard to hear the other person you are talking to but overall great product.
1,CRAP!!,"this product is a piece of junk, i went with ordering the more expensive xbox one that looked like the one i got with my xbox. It showed up and I tried to use it and I could hear the people in my party, but they couldn't hear me! the mic was defective. Great product."
1,Horrible,"I ordered this for a friend of mine and for starter it arrived several days late which for me isn't that big of a deal on something this small so ill ignore it. my problem is that it broke after just 3 days, plus it is not what was shown in the picture nor is it made by Microsoft like I was lead to believe.Edit: I noticed they had changed the picture, when I bought it there was a ""Xbox 360"" logo on the white side of the picture."
5,he4ad phones for 360,"my son uses these all the time, they are great. he plays black ops and halo reach all the time."
1,Orange Bagged Product,"From some of the sellers (PlayitNow is who I ordered from)you will receive this product in an orange bag and not the plastic package that is pictured. Also it is the first generation headset and not the one pictured in the plastic package. I guess you have to know when the first generation headsets were released (2005) to know what you are purchasing. Also, I left feedback on the order and then received a demand from the seller to remove my rating, basically telling me that I was a stupid buyer. I am sending the headset back because it squeals, statics, I am not able to hear and no one is able to hear me. If you are looking a cheap product, then by all means purchase this one. If you want a working headset, then make sure to read the released date or order the product from Walmart.com with free shipping and a $14.95 price tag as of August 02, 2011 which is what I did."
2,Breaks easy,ive had to buy three of these mics in the past including this one due to the quality of the mic. i wuldnt waste my money on one of these again. what i would do is buy the wireless one. ive had the wireless one forever and my friend even said that is dog chewed it up and it still worked so they are defenitely durable.
3,Works as intended,This headset is only getting 3 stars cause it didn't come in the original box like shown in the picture and wasn't shipped from microsoft. It does work as intended and seems like it will last a while but we shall see. Great product if you are looking to replace it with the original headset xbox came with.
3,"Breaks fast, good for the money","This is like the default xbox headset. Mine broke so I bought a replacement. I should have bought a better one. This one broke very fast too. Only covers one ear, so it feels funny when you hear only in one ear. I personally like turtle beach headsets."
4,"Great, but the older model.","This was probably my mistake, but I was unaware that this was the older model when I purchased this for my nephew. He said that he uses a Razer Onza controller that doesn't utilize these older headsets, though he had another controller that he had no problem using. I'm glad to see that this headset is still in working condition for him and that he enjoys it.Overall, I'm quit satisfied at the speed of the shipping, the products quality, and especially the price."
2,The one that came with the system is better.,"After several years of the headset that came with the game working, there was a horrible accident involving my foot, and the connector, and I found myself with out a mic.Thus I decided to replace it with the same thing, nothing fancy. Sadly, they changed the default that you can buy. The three prong connector was replaced by a single prong connector, and the microphone is horrible. Its usable but only just, I have to sit in my living room screaming into the thing for any one to hear me, while this might not be bad when in the heat of the moment, its not when your match making with your friends. With the mic that came with the system anything I said was picked up, now my typical conversations go something like this:Me: What match do you want to play!My Buddy: What? I can't hear you.Me: WHAT! MATCH! DO YOU! WANT TO! PLAY!My Buddy: I caught part of that, something about the match?Then I realize I am sitting alone in a room screaming at my TV..."
1,Do not trust JPMFUN,"The listing leads one to believe the product for sale is a Microsoft XBox 360 Headset, white. I did not receive that, I received a Komodo brand headset for the Xbox 360 that came in a damaged container. The corner of the container looks like someone stepped on the corner. Also, looks quite different from the headset in the picture on the listing."
4,"Good Headset of Xbox 360 Native Games, but back-compat is a different story...","Everyone needs to remember that the majority of people are playing Halo 2. Its a fact that can be viewed at Xbox.com. The headset itself works great with Native Xbox 360 games, like GRAW for the 360 , Quake 4 for the 360 and the like. HOWEVER, it does not work well with back-compat games because of the emulation engines being utilized. These headsets/360 have noise-cancelling technology contained within them. All of the original xbox games do not support that feature. Thus, the the emulation software has difficulties marrying the two technologies. Halo 2, for instance, is terrible. People are quiet and their voices sound jarbled. Thats just the emulation software trying to overcome the noise-cancelling technology."
1,Broke the first day,"Our headphone came with the xbox 360, after one month we got xbox live, and plugged in the headphone. Three hours later, SNAP, the headphone is broken and history. My kids enjoyed their 3 hours though."
1,Worst. Headset. EVAR!,"For serious. This headset couldn't be crappier if it tried. For starters, the whole thing feels cheap. It doesn't adjust to fit your head right and the microphone doesn't pivot down far enough. With the headband vertical, my microphone rests somewhere near the side of my nose.If you tap the cord in any way, you'll get a burst of static in your ear. I hope you don't move a muscle when you are gaming, because as the cord is draped across your chest you'll get little fuzzy bits of static.Crap. Crap. Crap. I'm going back to my JVC cell phone earpiece."
1,Piece of garbage,"Bought this over a year ago but only started using it over the last few months. It couldn't have possibly been taken better care of, and yet it simply stops working in the middle of a game. No output in the headphones, no response on the mic. One minute it's working fine, the next it's a doornail. Dead. And $20 for this POS? Typical Microsoft. Way to keep that reputation going, fellas.Couldn't be happier with my Xbox 360 console. This MS headset on the other hand? Worthless. Stay away."
1,Broke after using it 3 times,"My first headset I got with my Xbox 360 worked fine out of the box, until I accidentally stepped on it.Liking the quality of that one, I bought another microsoft headset. This one had the small on off toggle and seemed a better option as it was more streamlined.Well it worked okay. The three times I used it. Then it stopped working. I treated this thing very gingerly, it wasn't ever stepped on or abused. It looks like new, but it just stopped working. I've talked to other people with similar issues.Get the plantronics headset if you're getting a new one. It's a better bang for your buck."
1,What were they thinking,"To make a good headset isn't that hard. For some reason they just couldn't do it. First off, the mic isn't long enough to reach close to your mouth and the mic sensitive enough to work when its not right in front of your mouth.The second big thing that they messed up is they put the MUTE button in the middle of the cord instead of by the controller. Think about it, your hands are already by the controller, add a mute button where your hands are. It is a such a pain if you have to mute you have to find this switch somewhere half way on your body and look at it to figure out which way to slide it.Don't buy this headset when there are better ones for the same price."
2,came with 360,"Xbox live is one of the greatest entertainments of the 21st century, being able to connect with millions of people worldwide is a great thing, this headset is NOT!!! This headset comes with the Xbox 360 premium if you did not already know that, when I got mine I used it a little over two weeks and It snaped at the point where it swivels to fit the ear. This product is not very sturdy, just pick it up and feel it, it just feels like its gonna snap. so stay away from this product I recommend a different headset maybe even the wireless one."
1,Broken after 2 months of little use,"I used this headset when it first arrived and it worked fine. Put it in a drawer for 2 months, took it out and now it's broken. It's flimsy and should probably cost about two dollars. Find another option - I will be."
2,Great at first but then I had problems.,"I bought the 360 that comes with the headset. I never really used it until after a couple weeks when I got Xbox live.I've had Xbox Live since Late June, and I am writing a review in early August.So my headset only lasted 2 months.The 360, and other Microsoft products work fine but this is trouble.The problem with mine is when I plugged it in, which I had played earlier this morning and I sent a message to one of my friends and I couldn't hear them and we did some figuring and I later found out when I tap the end of my cord it cuts the sound.And now it doesn't work.If I were you I would buy a different 360 headset."
1,Made very cheap!!!,"All right here is what happend to me a couple of weeks ago I bought the xbox 360 bundle system ( headset, wireless controller, ect..) from Best buy. I took very good care of the headset making sure after every use it was on a secure place to put it. The next time i went to use it the wire shorted out and all i can do is wiggle it a little bit and sometimes if i am lucky hear the people talking. I think the next head set i am getting is going to be wireless so i can't have anything short out on me again."
2,"Bearable, but uncomfortable.","This headset is just like the PS2 Online one in the respect that its over the top, too small, and has an annoying thing on the other side that digs into your head constantly. They're good for about 20 minutes, but thats only about one game and most people will play for about an hour or so.You should buy a Plantronics headset (the one Armstrong used on the moon). They've come out with three that are made for Xbox Live, but are made for the Xbox. They are compatible with the 360, but there isn't a volume control, but they work well on the default. The three they've came out with are the GameCom X10 (its an over-the-head one just like this one, only better), the GameCom X20 (single ear bud thing), and the Halo 2 Edition of the GameCom X20 (same concept, but pay the $55 if you want just because it says Halo 2 on it...).http://xbox.ign.com/articles/682/682282p1.html"
1,So bad that its amazing,"The original headset that came with my xbox 360 was great. Fit well, clarity was fine, etc.After a couple years, that one broke (wire disconnected inside the ear piece)... so I bought this. Immediately I realized this headset has a serious design flaw - rather than placing the on/off and volume at the base where it connects to the controller, its instead dangling in the air. WHY?? Its very annoying, the original design was a lot better.To make matters worse, this headset stopped working about the 5th time I used it. How ridiculous."
1,Garbage,"As everyone else has said, this headset is complete junk. It's as if Microsoft went out of its way to see how much they could make this suck. The cord can come loose at the connection to the controller, or it could come loose at the headset. Then you have the ridiculously stupid placement of the mute, despite the fact that the original design was just fine! They were like, ""oops... we accidentally did something right... we need a new revision!"""
3,it breaks every 3 or 4 weeks,"It's a great item, if only it didn't break, sooooooooo often. This is the last one of these I will buy, and then I will get a REAL HEADSET, that lasts longer than 30 days!!!!!!!!!"
5,excellent guitar artistry,I wanted to hear a Dilermando Reis selection for which I have sheet music and the guitar playing is excellent.
4,Amusing beginning.,"Tite Kubo, Bleach: Strawberry and the Soul Reapers (Viz, 2001)Tite Kubo opens the popular (and, seemingly, never-ending) Bleach with Strawberry and the Soul Reapers. Ichigo ""Strawberry"" Kurosaki, a high-school student proficient in the martial arts, has a seemingly-chance encounter with Rukia Kuchiki, a soul reaper (a ghost sent from the Lord of the Dead to collect the souls of the recently, or soon-to-be, deceased). Through a rather convoluted series of events, Strawberry ends up absorbing a good deal of Rukia's power, and must take on the soul reaper's job while Rukia regains her strength in the human world. A fun beginning. ***"
4,I liked it,"I liked this book. specially the characters, the author is good on what he does. I hope the future volumes will be as good as this one."
4,Love that point stick.,"I got this keyboard after replacing my IBM T60p with an Compaq (HP) 6910p and didn't like the Compaq keyboard. The TrackPoint stick on this keyboard is much better than HP's, and I like the keyboard layout better too. The full size num pad is handy and the keys are responsive. Because of the great point stick I wouldn't get any other keyboard. The only things I don't like are the function keys and arrow keys are not full size (as on a laptop), and occasionally the left and right button keys for the point stick either don't register or register twice. The touchpad left and right buttons always work correctly."
3,Nice design with a defect,"I purchased this for my desktop (Dell) computer because I always wanted to have a keyboard with a touchpad and a pointing device like the IBM laptop. I tried a similar keyboard made by Adesso 10 years ago but the pointer rubber cap was cracked after a while, plus more impotantly the keyboard entry often time jumped to a different position on the screen. But it was only the half the price of this $97 IBM keyboard.To my disappointment, despite the sleek desing and the sturdier rubber cap of the pointer, the keyboary entry JUMPED just like the Adesso keyboard. I called the IBM support to fix the problem. I could not get tech support because of the huge IBM bureaucracy. The software that came with the product was not helpful at all: it only provides a link to the manufacturer, Levro.SO I AM RETURNING THIS KEYBOARD."
4,"great keyboard, where is the WIRELESS version?","as the others have said, this is a great keyboard, particularly if you are accustomed to or like the Thinkpad touchpoint keyboard environment. the keys have enough travel to make it feel like actually typing.my only complaint is that this is a perfect keyboard to have a wireless version of. its light, easy to use, and you dont need a mouse. I have a wireless mouse and keyboard in my living room for use with a media center PC attached to my stereo and flat screen monitor and if this keyboard came in a wireless version I could eliminate my need for the separate mouse and keyboard and just have this one light keyboard/mouse instead."
3,Great Keyboard - but be careful,"This is a fantastic keyboard. It has the flat keys, which I prefer, just like on my Lenovo laptop, rather quiet, feel very well built, solid. I bought this keyboard because I purchased a Lenovo ThinkStation, and I wanted a ""laptop like"" keyboard which had a built in number pad, function keys, the great IBM Trackpoint and also the scroll pad, essentially everything my Lenovo laptop keyboard had.Unfortunately, after much effort, talking to several experts, this keyboard was not compatible with my ThinkStation. The Trackpoint and Scroll pad never worked, so I reluctantly traded it in for the latest Lenovo keyboard which does not have the scroll pad. I bought a seperate number pad, which works, but is not as convenient as the built in pad. For the life of me, I cannot understand why Lenovo discontinued this great keyboard.I would give this keyboard five stars if it was compatible with my ThinkStation, or at least if I was able to determine that before I purchased it."
5,The right choice,"This keyboard is perfect for me The letters are slightly closer together than in a regular keyboard, they require less extension and pressure on the fingers.You have an option to use either the touchpad or the stick. Getting the right drivers may take a bit of time, but is worth the trouble. I am using it with a Dell PC and HP monitor. Since I have been using it I have not been bothered by the arthritis in my hands."
4,Going nowhere yet un-put-downable.,"Gentle, clever and yet rapier sharp.A tale of lost opportunities viewed as dignity, or one man's emotional constipation that he sees as an indication of success. A book that goes nowhere and yet is un-put-downable. Loved it."
3,Beautiful but a bit slow,"This book gives you a lot. A very unique character, that doesn't come along every day and a sweet and subtle story that leads you through moral and romantic dilemmas. I did feel a bit tired at some points, maybe it could have been nice if more happened."
1,unexpected,I was surprised at how much I disliked this book.. I was expecting to be blown away because of the reviews and awards it had been given. I just didn't see the greatness inn this book
5,Dignity Reserved,Remains of the Day is such a sad book; Mr Stevens seems defined only by his job as a butler and his dedication to duty and dignity. He suffers humiliations from his employer and employers acquaintances and yet feels a sense of pride and professional triumphs. His relationships are formal and repressed and again his professionalism takes priority over any personal interactions. He either does not realise or does not want to realise the feelings of those around him. He doesn't seem aware of how his loyalties damage his personal relationships. He is the perfect example of the British 'stiff upper lip'.Ishiguro paints a wonderful picture of a stoic butler coming to terms with the struggles of British class in post-war England and his inability to conduct any close relationships. It's the third Ishiguro book that I've read and all three have been very different; all wonderfully written. Highly recommended.
5,"An English butler's story, unexpectedly beautiful.","The Remains of the Day is perhaps the most finely crafted novelsI've read. Ishiguro's unwavering control of tone makes hischaracters so real that the heartbreaking lonliness you feelwhen reading the book is your own. Subtle, understated, andbrilliant - the movie, while good, can't do justice to theexcellent prose."
5,An excellent book that I find easy to re-read.,"It seems to me that this book draws rather fascinating lines between the extremes of how one should live their life. Sort of stoicism vs emotionalism. Stephens, the butler, reminds me of a samurai-- pledged to put his sense of honor and duty above his own desires. He is a good man, but emotionally isolated. He is a tragic figure because his life is one of work and routine rather than balance, and he cannot live for himself-- at least not directly. Someone once said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living"", and someone else once said that ""the unlived life is not worth examining."" I think both apply to Stephens. He lives in just as contained a fashion as he examines his life. But Stephens' life, though ""unlived"" by some standards, is worthy of our examination, as is the rest of this wonderful, wonderful book. This is one of the few books that I read and re-read. And then read again."
4,An outstanding scholarly work,"Carey Moore has done the Church and the academy a great service in this new scholarly translation and commentary on the Deuterocanonical book of Tobit.Moore provides information on possible sources, possible languages of composition, textual discoveries, and usage among Jewish and Christian communities, as well as the excellent translation.The book is fairly dense, and is written with an academic audience in mind; but is certainly well within the reach of the informed layperson. I used this book during my seminary years to my great profit.I highly recommend this addition to the ""Anchor Bible"" series."
3,Worth it?,"I think this is a great reinforcement tool, but not needed. The books and CD's you get with the books are proper enough. I would even buy a cross vendor book to make sure you are used to seeing things in a different light."
4,Buddha Freud!,"Magid does a good job comparing psychoanalysis and Zen practice. Obviously they're not perfect fits, but he lucidly reveals their common ground. He draws upon 30 years of experience in both practices. The book is a bit dense at times with some of the psychological terms, but nothing too difficult. I found his analytical models for the two schools of Zen to be fascinating and revealing: bottom-up (Soto Zen) and top-down (Rinzai). For that alone, the book is reading.--Andre Doshim Halaw"
2,"An curious early attempt, but not their best album.","I own about 14 Manhattan Transfer albums and am a big fan. But this one was a definite dissappointment. As their first album (1971?), even one of the members called it a ""false start"" for the MT and their move into conquering the genre of vocal jazz. This album is interesting from a collecting standpoint, but with only one true MT member here, it doesn't reflect their true sound as exected. There's some country influence here as well. If you are new to the MT and want their real jazz sound, try something else and leave this for the MT completists.Also, where are the 2 and 3 star ratings from last month? It seems as if someone at Amazon is erasing the negative reviews, which leaves those of us who want true reviews with no one to trust."
5,Usable version of Sones de Michoacan,"If you like the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico's Sones Antiguos de Michoacan you will love the last 3 tracks on this CD: 2nd Jarabe, 1st Jarabe & 3rd Jarabe with Diana. As any folklorico dancer knows obtaining usable music of the BFdM is difficult & these last tracks are nice arrangements."
1,Bad,although the shipper was very prompt in delivery. The item is of terrible quality. It appears that it was copied from a monoural type of recording and they tried to make it stereo.Very bad recording
4,if you like the ballet folklor...........,"actually i like the last 3 tracks the jarabes are great, this are sones from michoacan now i ask myself does anyone know's what cd i could find las sonajas? if so let me know thanks."
3,BORING,Sorry to all thouse people who think this book is great but I don't think so. I found this book very boring because it just gos on and on with them on the train. I did not even finish it. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because my friend read it and said it gets better at the end so I will give it another chance.
5,One of My Favorites,"Though this wasn't really a historical event, something may of happened like this. The writer mentions that between 1870-1900 was when most communities were being born, so that's the main idea of the story. This is about Teresa Angelino Viscardi, a 14 year old Italian Immigrant. She travels with her large family on a train and by wagon all the way to Idaho territory. But the journey is not easy. It is FAR from easy. They cross a river and two girl's from another wagon drown. Then the saddest thing happens! But you have to read it of course. This diary was so well written I kept thinking that Teresa and Netta, her little sister, who you come to love, were real. This is another powerfully emotionaly and exciting, and truthful Dear America Diary. Keep up the good work Dear America writers! We can't wait for more. Even though this book is sad, you MUST READ IT! Sniffle, sniffle, sob, sob. :(But most of the journey was :)"
5,Great!,"In the spring of 1883, fourteen-year-old Teresa Viscardi and her large Italian-American family leave their home in New York City and head west to Idaho to participate in a new community called Opportunity. However Teresa hates the ides. She wants to return to New York City, where everything is familiar and orderly. Instead, she's on a crowded train, and then on a covered wagon caravan, with her annoying family. She most despises her younger sister Netta for always reading her diary. But when tragedy strikes, Teresa realizes how much her family means to her. Since at that time her father was away because of a gold strike Teresa may be the only one who can save her big family from all parishing. This was another great book and full of details on the hardships of the journey west and the hopes of one young girl!"
5,an awesome dear america book,"I love dear america books and this one is one of the best. it's about a girl named tereasa who's traveling west in 1883. I think the characters are very well developed, espesailly Teresa and her bratty younger sister, Netta. It is a great story with an awesome but yet very powerful ending. It's definatly worth reading!!!!!!!!!"
4,West To A Land Of Plenty,"The story of Teresa Angelino Viscardi is a wonderful book! It tells the first person story of her life on a train from New York to Idaho territory. Her family is ready to leave...besides her. At first she hates the train, but soon she finds out that living in a train isn't all that bad. From avoiding a snoop in her diary, to listening to Mr. Andrew's speeches, this book takes the cake!"
5,sharks hate sailors,"this is only a 3 song disc that has more heart than many other bands full song list. i would rock this in the shower, on a plain, just about any place i could at church. so put together so good. buy it buy it used doesnt matter you should own it."
2,Not the comedy you might expect,"Although this was marketed as a Cantinflas movie, he appears in only 5 short scenes and does not play the comedian we know and love. The film stars Carlos Orellana, who finds out he is going to die soon, so he lives like there is no tomorrow. He drops lots of money on fine wines, stands up to his wife, and settles problems all around him. The storyline and acting are dime-a-dozen. The box says it lasts 104 minutes, but it's only 88, and I was glad to see it end there.There are no subtitles, it's only in Spanish. Most of the actors speak with a Castillian/Spain accent (it takes place in Spain). If you are a true Cantinflas fan, you might need to see this just to check it off your list. If you're looking for a good comedy, this is not it. ""El Sube y Baja,"" ""Por Mis Pistolas,"" and ""El Padrecito"" are all good Cantinflas titles that you should see."
2,Esteban By Request,"On a whim, I bought Estaban's "" All My Love "" and loved it, so I chose to buy "" By Request "". I have to say that I was disapointed. There are some tracks on "" By Request "" that I think are wonderful, such as, Al Di La , but over all I have to agree with some of the other reviews, this is a poor effort. When I listend to it for the first time, I sat here and thought "" WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ? "" If you decide to get this album .... you had better like TRUMPET, because there is WAY, WAY, WAY MORE TRUMPET than guitar."
1,el amor de mi alma,I have been playing guitar for over fifty years and this guy is the worst guitarist I've ever heard on a CD..On this album his guitar is tinny sounding and his licks amatuerish..How did he ever get a recording contract?
5,Bravo Zulu!,"Dr. Ullman has, with startling clarity and prescience provided the reader with a blueprint for international stability and national security. His analysis is sound and uncompromising and his recommendations capture the essence of not only today's strategic environment, but the future's as well. This book needs to be required reading for the present presidential administration, as well as the entire defense establishment. More importantly, it should be in the library of every informed American. To turn a nautical term denoting excellence: Bravo Zulu!"
3,Wasn't that impressed,"I just got this for scrapbooking and was a little disappointed with the variety of fonts - SOOO many of them were the same! It says 10,000 fonts but most of them have a up to five different slants on them (italics, bold, ect) and that cuts the number dramatically. I will probably use a dozen and I guess for the couple bucks I paid it was worth it but it's definetly not a must buy."
1,Do NOT purchase this item...,"Ozone is a severe pollutant. Ozone in the upper atmosphere is naturally occurring and environmentally beneficial; it shields the Earth's surface from the sun's harmful ultraviolet light. It is important not to confuse this with the fact that ozone in the Earth's lower atmosphere, where we live and breathe, is a harmful air pollutant. Ground-level ozone is regulated by Federal and State Clean Air legislation.Exposure to ozone can irritate the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs. It's especially harmful for those with asthma and studies show that it can cause serious and permanent damage in the lungs.If you're not convinced, please read more at the EPA's website."
4,Introduction to Huguenot genealogy,"This book covers some of the basic history of the Huguenots and their settlement areas in Great Britain and later in North America and South Africa.It discusses the records from the United Kingdom which can assist a researcher in tracing Huguenots. Everything from Probate to Livery Company records are discussed. In addition, a brief chapter is included on research sources in France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland.This is a good introductory book, particularly if you suspect that your Huguenots passed through Britain in their travels."
1,American Indian Artifacts,"I was so disappointed and dismayed that I paid shipping in two directions for this book based on the previous review. There are practically no photos in this book whatsoever, it is completely useless as an indentification tool."
2,Insulting and Stupid,"I suppose if you're going to put this on your bicycle, you're either a self-loathing blonde who has bought into this cultural ""joke,"" or someone who digs cheap, stupid humor. Or maybe you're so anti-PC that you want to show off your ugly side, forgetting that ""PC"" is often just a term for courtesy and respect. It's not original, it's not new, and probably the only people who will appreciate it are those who already have this sticker on their bumper. You two can give each other knowing winks on the freeway. Freedom of speech is good, but I'm glad there's only so much room on a bumper sticker."
5,I liked this product a lot. It smelled ...,I liked this product a lot. It smelled great and left my skin feeling really soft and clean.
4,This body wash has a lot of suds. ...,"This body wash has a lot of suds. I had to remind myself to use only a little! The lemon verbena scent is probably more suited to a man. It seemed almost a little peppery, but it was very refreshing and not overpowering at all. This also wouldn't be suitable for someone with really dry skin. I found the formula to be a little drying and it felt a little itchy in some areas. Overall, I'd recommend this product for a man, but I think there are other kinds of body washes that would be better for women."
4,A Fascinating Read,"John Long's ""Mountains of Madness"" tells the story of the author's fossil-hunting expeditions in Antarctica. The book's title comes from H.P. Lovecraft's jarring epic ""At the Mountains of Madness"" -- a classic novella of science and horror set in the southern continent. The author's references to Lovecraft's terrifying tale effectively convey the splendor and danger of the Antarctic wilderness. Long also writes with a wonderful sense of humour --his warmth and charm draw the reader into a entertaining and informative narrative of scientific discovery and individual experience. This book is a must read for anyone who enjoys stories of popular science and adventure."
3,Green Bullfrog - released in 1980 on ECY records.,"Green Bullfrog - released in 1980 on ECY records.Strange blues project recorded in 1970/71 by famed British record producer Derek Lawrence, featuring some heavyweights on the UK music scene at the time, like Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Paice of Deep Purple. Features Ritchie, Albert Lee, and Big Jim Sullivan on guitar. All of the artists on the record were given fake names like ""BOOTS"" (Ritchie) for legal reasons!Tracks are:- Side A -My Baby Left MeMakin' TimeLawdy Miss ClawdyBullfrog- Side B -I Want YouI'm a Free ManWalk a Mile in My ShoesLovin' You Is Good For Me, Baby"
2,Not what I expected...,"I don't really like the product... It's super thick and heavy and doesn't seem to do much for my hair (very, very thick, natural, curly hair)... I've only used it once since my purchase, don't know if i'm going to use it again but if I do I'll have to thin it quite a bit..."
2,It did nothing,"This product really didn't do well with my hair. For the price it cost I expected it to do something, but it did nothing. I was trying to use other shea butter leave in conditioners just to try it out in my hair, besides the normal cantu shea butter that I usually use on my hair. Thus, my hair is like 4b through out and in only in the back of my head and front middle portions are 4a-3c hair type. Nevertheless, this product did well in those sections of my hair but didn nothing for the more cottony, thicker parts. I will not be purchasing this product again. I only tried it as an experiment. I will continue to stick with Cantu Shea Butter."
4,Shea Mositure Leave-In Conditioner is Great!,Being a new comer to the natural look (1 and half years now) I wanted my hair to look healthy and non-frizzy (dry). This product gives me both. Used weekly as a leave-in conditioner between washes & as the leave-in mosturizer after washing I much say I am extremely happy! It leaves my hair silky smoothe and it doesn't weigh it down. I recommend it to everyone who ask me how do I care for my kinky curls.
3,just ok,"THIS LEAVE IN IS JUST OK..IT IS VERY THICK AND SMELLS GOOD, BUT I'M SURE I COULD FIND A BETTER LEAVE IN THE WILL MAKE MY HAIR EXTREMLY SOFT."
2,Smells Terrible,"I guess this stuff detangles fine but, for something ""natural"", it stinks to high heaven. It has the strongest fake cherry scent I've ever smelled. Just horrible. Had to wash my pillow cases to get rid of the super strong smell."
4,any alcohol?,"can someone tell me if this contains any kind of alcohol? or parabens?im looking for something all natural,if this does contain alcohol,does anyone have any suggestions to alcohol free products?"
3,Just an okay LI to me!,"After using other Shea Moisture products, I was excited to give this product a try. It's not as moisturizing or provides enough slip that I would like to have in a leave in, but it does have really good natural ingredients. When I use this product, I will use just a little drop of a another leave-in conditioner with more slip (Curl Junkie Smoothing LI or Karen's Body Beautiful Hair Nectar) just so it's easier to work through my hair. If you like a lot of slip from a leave in then this is not for you. The ingredients does give this LI a decent advantage so if you are truly sticking to all organic/vegan products then this may be the LI for you. Hope this helps!"
3,It was ok,"It was an ok product. I was really going by the other reviews, and have a natural hair style, not a perm. It did make it soft. Though I wont purchase this product again."
1,thumbs down,"I had high hopes for this as shea butter is so moisturizing, but it is so heavy it is unusable. Very disappointing."
4,Great- leave it!!,I love all of the Shea Moisture products (skin & hair) and was really happy to find this leave-in conditioner.
5,Used this product for Years!,"I love this leave in Conditioner. I may not care for the shampoo, but I use this conditioner DAILY. It keeps my hair nourished and I believe it aids in my hair growth too."
1,DANDRUFF,"I love Shea butter, however I am heart broken that this product did not work for me. Yes it did moisturize and detangled my curly thick hair, but at the price of having dandruff the next day. I really really wanted this product to work, but unforgivably my scalp was not having it. I have many other Shea butter items in my hair regime so I was completely surprised how I had so much dandruff with this product. (This has nothing to do with the seller..my item came perfectly fine.)"
1,WAS DISAPPOINTED,"I was quite excited when I bought this product after reading all the reviews. I was first surprised to see how very thick it was when I put it in my hands. I rubbed it to smooth it out and put it through my hair. I didn't like it. It was still too thick and didn't glide on my hair (by the way, I have natural African hair with a keratin process). After I let my hair dry, I did my usual flat iron routine and my hair seemed like a feather which I didn't like. I tried the product out 2 more times before I decided it was time to stop use when my hair kept getting frizzy and I was getting flyaways. I'm not sure why this didn't work. It seemed to do nothing for my hair and worse, so I'm gonna try another product (Wen) and see how that goes. Really wish I could have liked it but not for me at all."
3,The jury is still out!,"It calms the frizzies down a little, but kinda leaves my daughter's hair dull looking. I'll use is a little longer and see what happens. Don't think I'll be repurchasing though!"
4,Great Product,"I was amazed that it smelled so good, pleasant and not overbearing and everyone complimented me on it. Its a great moisturizer and yes, a little goes a long way. I like the fact that this was made with natural ingredients. My hair didn't feel greasy or weighed down. My friends (both black and white) loved it too. Its great to put on you hair before it is flat ironed. I'd buy this product again."
2,Disappointed!,"I got this for my sister who has thick and straight hair about 6"" below shoulder level. She first used on damp hair but no improvement. Then on dry hair but never looked as expected. No smoothness. According to reviews, it should look good on thick hair but I feel her hair is worse than before after using this product. I really do not know whether the quantity she applies is not enough but she uses about 1-2 teaspoonfuls at a time and twice a week. Can anyone suggest what has gone wrong?"
3,mas o menos,"Este leave solo me lo puedo poner en la punta del pelo por que si me lo pongo en el resto me lo engrasa, aparte de eso huele como a goma de mascar y bastante fuerte."
2,Very Heavy,In my opinion this leave in conditioner is way too heavy . It weights my hair down. PropVery!!! !!!! Heavy !
2,Doesn't do much for me,"I heard great reviews so I decided to try. For my hair, as well as my child's hair, it didn't do much, if anything. Our hair actually feels very dry after using the product. We both have hair fine, curly hair."
2,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,"Different hair takes different to products. When i first received this product i was excited to try it. when i got it and tried it for the first time, i liked it . It smells like bananas and coconuts. when i put it in my hair and let it sit in my hair by the end of the day it was a bit dry. my hair just needs more moisture than others. will i purchase this again ? NO. theres more products out there that do better than what this does. i'll continue to make my own concoctions. :) lol"
4,I enjoyed using Reach Plaque Sweeper toothbrush. The ...,I enjoyed using Reach Plaque Sweeper toothbrush. The curved angle and sweeper feature made a big difference in reaching and cleaning between back teeth. I'd definitely buy this product and I'd also recommend this product to people. An A+ in my book.
3,NOT FOR ME,BUT I LIVE IN SEVERE PAIN 24/7. I JUST LIKE TO TRY THINGS THAT ARE NATURAL INSTEAD OF PRESCRIPTION PILLS WHICH ARE HARMFUL FOR YOU. PERHAPS IF YOU ARE IN MINOR PAIN IT WILL WORK BUT NOT FOR SEVERE PAIN.
5,"Just sit back, relax, and hum along~","This compilation of the best Beatles' songs done using children's voices and light-hearted instruments is definitely a work of genius. The tunes go easy on the ears, and and make the listener feel almost nostalgic. The best thing about it is that it works for all ages, because the the tunes are not only innocent and un-melodramatic enough for children, but their childlike quality and endearing lyrics will also appeal to adult listeners. The only drawback is that they have too few songs on the CD (13 in total)... and thus the saying ""You can never get enough of a good thing"" runs sadly true..."
1,A Low-Down Dirty Shame,This album is nothing short of insipid. It sounds un-inspired and nothing on par with other toy groups like 'Pianosaurus' I think it a complete travesty that the estate of Charles Schulz would lend their brand to this.
1,NO,"no offense, but i don;t like it. at all. the Beatles are waay better..I would know. I'm 13, and i looooove the Beatles....so when i previewd this CD i thought it would be great.....but it's not....just get the real, beatle-sung-stuff! its better! TRUST ME!,V,, <3peace and luvgAbSpAzZ"
3,"That ""Reverie"" Song steals the show. . .","Is it just me, or is that lovely song ""Anna's Reverie"" (written by Paul Baillargeon) one of the most beautiful and sadly overlooked songs in film? I've never heard anyone comment on it and it is truly haunting. As for the film, it is full of terrific ideas and is not badly put together, but it is decidedly amateurish and marred by ugly production values that are quite dated. Overall, the film is a perfect candidate for a remake, having good ideas but needing a more polished production to pull them off. Byrne does a nice job in the title role, however, and the song makes it worth a look. . ."
3,Interestingly Eerie,"This film is about a brilliant yet emotionally cold 11 year-old girl who discovers that she is the product of an experiment in genetic engineering. She is the clone of a great physicist named Anna Zimmerman, who grew up in a Nazi concentration camp, became a scientist, but died in a fire shortly before completing her invention of a genetic replicator. Now a research center with dubious motives has secretly cloned several girls (who grow up apart and have no clue about their origin) in the hopes of having Zimmerman's research completed.There is little science in the film, and the quality of the acting, writing and direction are on the television level. Nevertheless, this film has an engaging eeriness to it, you care about the characters, and it plays like a mystery with with some realistically menacing villains."
2,This product is no longer valid!,"Don't be misled - this older product is a worthwhile review, but it doesn't cover the latest exams. Instead, see the 2005 version."
4,sinister intent?,"Harold Pinter's _The Birthday Party_:A young man lives with his mother at a run-down boarding house near the beach. Two visitors come and shake things up. They don't do anything wild or unusual, but they question and intimidate the young man, until the reader becomes unsure what sinister plans the two men have in mind.Pinter's strength lies in his dialogue, which is thoroughly believable and memorable. Not for a moment does the reader doubt that these scenes could happen (and may HAVE happened) in real life.As this reader read the play, the tension built and built, as I became more and more sympathetic to the young man, awaiting to learn his fate, as his own will seemingly deteriorated.I would agree that this play is a funny read, but it's certainly very unsettling as well.If you haven't read anything by Harold Pinter, or are curious because you've read his other plays, _The Birthday Party_ is worth checking out.ken32"
4,sounds that makes me cry,"that sounds of music takes you for atour , it grabs you and youdon't wont to let go...I love this musicbecause it's always makes me cry when I need to..."
3,"Good, but...","I have this astringent and I like it, but i'm not exactly sure that it's doing something!! I mean, it kind of tingles and stuff, but I'm not sure that it helps with acne, I've seen no change because of it."
4,It works for me!!,I have EXTREMELY oily skin (T-zone) and rosacea. (Bad mix).. I have been using this product for a couple weeks now and my skin is less shiny and I have NO breakouts! I use it in the morning and then again after I get home from work. I would use it in the evening as well but I have to use the medication for my rosacea and not sure if it would make for a bad combination. My skin is not dried out anywhere on my face. The smell isn't to bad. Similar to an antiseptic. My pores are much less visable on my nose as well!! I would recommend this product to anyone with skin problems like mine!!
2,Shipping was good but product didn't work,"The item says to put the substance on your skin 2-3 times a day, so I did. After about four weeks of use.... NOTHING!!!It could be me but I don't recommend the product."
3,Smells so BAD,"What they don't tell you about this product is that it smells HORRENDOUS. The smell is like that of rodent urine with a hint of mint. It's most especially noticeable if you use it on and around your nose. Thankfully, most of it goes away after about half an hour. Though I'm not sure if it actually went away or I just got used to the smell...As far as how well it works, that's the only thing keeping this review at 3 stars. Works exceptionally well."
3,Good for oily skin,"My skin: Sensitive, oily, red/inflammatory, acne-proneI've been using this product on and off for a few years. It's good for people who have bacteria-caused (as opposed to hormone-caused) acne, though of course it could never measure up to benzoyl peroxide, the single most effective known agent at killing P. acnes, the bacteria that causes acne. However, this is a decent product to use if you're not ready to break out the big guns or simply don't have that much acne. It's got a pleasant cooling sensation to it; just don't drown your face in it, it can dry out your skin (therefore causing a reaction where your skin will produce an excess of oil to compensate).Overall: Good for oily teenage skin that doesn't have dire acne problems."
5,Wonderfully helpfull,"For those looking to purchase a horse, this book is a wonderfull way to keep track of different horses confirmation, pedigree, and positive/negative traits. I thoroughly recomend it."
2,Writer's Handbook - very little US publishing info,I bought this believing it would have primarily US publishers. Instead it is mainly UK and European (the price pre-printed on the book is in pounds and not dollars; should have been my first clue!). I am returning this book to get The Writer's Market 2007.
2,Not what I expected,Reminds me of music in the 90's. the CD is dated in my opinion. Wasn't what I was hoping for. Songs are just ok
5,Sweet Dreams and Starry Nights gentle lullabies,"The CD arrived very quickly and it is a beautiful collection of soft, gentle lullabies. I am very pleased with it. It is very comforting. I wouldn't mind falling asleep to it myself."
4,Bob Would Be Proud Of His Boy,This is the type of cd you just put on and forget about. The best 51 min and 47 sec I've heard in a very long time. I can't wait for his new release.....
4,great cd damian,gawd damian...i real love your cd.it's music is so uplifting..whenever i'm depressed i listen to mr. marley....i love this cd.it's my favourite.and i love you too...you sexy thing.
5,THIS IS THE BEST,"I love regaee, i have every bob marley cd, lots of peter tosh, buju banton and israel vibrations. This cd (Mr.Marley) is the best one i have. This cd can put you to sleep, wake you up in the morning and put you into the greatest mood ever (thats without use of illegal narcotics). If you love regaee as much as i, purchase this cd, it will rock your world."
1,Is this a joke???,"Awful awful reggae. Just because you have ""Marley"" attached to it doesn't make it solid gold. Everything ""Marley"" did wasn't the best ever. People need to get over the whole ""Marley"" and be a little objective here:The music is weak.The lyrics are weak.It sounds bland.It sounds like Speak'n'Spell reggae.Way to ride your dead Dad's D-list material into the land of completely forgettable. Standing ovation!!!You can put lipstick on a pig they say..."
3,"good, but not brillant","To me, Jr. Gong is not the best one of Bob Marley's sons, cause this status is Ky-Mani's.Damian makes quite good music, but he often seems to me like a little boy, although i can't say why. He's quite similar to his brother julian, but my favourite tip is another one of his brothers, Ky-Mani."
3,The List Price for this book is $16.95,"It is imperative readers are informed and ensure that there are options in choosing where books are bought. This is one lesser of many outrageously priced, books on this website."
5,Great Product,This works really well. It tastes very bitter and it lasts through many hand washings for several days. Definitely will help me stop biting my nails!
5,The only thing that worked!!!,"This is worth every penny! My kid is 11 years old and has had this habit since birth, it was getting to the point where it was affecting his speech and the shape of his mouth. We are now at day 40 and no relapse, only had to put in on every other day and IT WORKED PERFECTLY!!!"
1,Doesn't really work,"My daughter is 2 and I have been trying to get her to stop sucking her thump for the longest, I would put this on her thumb, 2 minutes later her thumb is right back in her mouth, should would frown a little bit but it did not stop her frrom sucking her thumb. She has stopped sucking her thumb throughout the day but still tries to do it at bedtime to soothe herself.I began putting sucks on her hands at night to keep her from sucking her thumb."
2,Didn't work!,"My 3 year old has been biting his nails for about a year. For some reason, the Mavala just doesn't stop him. Can't quite understand why because the taste is horrible! Usually, he puts up a fight during application but after a few hours, he's back at it. Now I find myself searching for another product that'll stop his nail biting."
5,Mavala STOP. <---- Is exactly what it makes you do.,"I've been biting my nails since the age of 4, I'm now 23 and can proudly say that I no longer bite my nails. One application was enough to have me cease all nail biting."
2,"My son grimaced, then laughed!","It could be that my son has a severe thumb sucking problem. I tried the stuff and it really is horrible! Every time I made the mistake of brushing my lips against my fingers, I had this very bitter aftertaste. However, my son grimaced for the first little while, then went right on sucking. He would suck at daycare and at night! He was so committed and persistent.Finally, we decided that we needed something more potent - the thumb guard. We shuddered as we shoveled out the $80. We hope to receive it in a day or two and will review it shortly.For those of you with children who have a severe thumb sucking problem, I do not recommend this product. However, it may be worth the $10 or so before you upgrade to a more costly option like the thumb guard. For those of you whose children have a problem that mainly just annoys you, then this should knock it right out.Final verdict:It is nasty for sure. It does not work for committed thumb sucking children."
5,Mavala Stop ( nail bite deterrent),This works great. My daughter who is 8 says it tasted gross and it is helping her to stop biting her nails. It even applies over regular polish. Highly recommend it and worth the price.
5,This stuff is MAVA-lous!!!!,"We bought this for our daughter who persistently sucked her thumb until she was six. We tried everything else we could think of to get her to stop with no luck. Mavala worked in just a couple of days. It smells horrid and I can imagine that it tastes even worse. The only drawback was that our daughter would accidentally lick her thumb while she was eating and get a taste of it. Since it only took a couple of days for her to break the habit it didn't really matter. One year later and she still doesn't suck her thumb. I just wish I had discovered this sooner before she had done the damage to her teeth. I thought it was expensive, but the price of braces is making it quite a bargain.Since I had to use very little of this product to make it work, I gave the remainder to a friend who used it to help him stop biting his nails. It was very effective for him as well even though he is an adult.I highly recommend Mavala Stop!"
2,Doesn't work for everyone.,"This did not work for either of my two 20 month old boys. However, I must say that when I put it on my own thumb to see what it was like, I thought it tasted horrible and it lasted for days. It may just be that my boys wanted their thumbs enough to ignore the taste, but it didn't even make them flinch."
2,Temporary solution,This product worked for the first week. But than she got used to the flavor and now she sucks on her fingers no matter how much i put on them. Now it also seems like shes defiant against it just because I put it on. She looks at me with defiance and starts sucking her fingers any way. :( The reviews were so good... but it didn't work for me.The company I bought it through though was very efficient. It took a very short time to receive it.
5,Wonderful product for thumbsucking,"This product works great to stop thumbsucking! There has been no thumbsucking in my house for 3 days. I'm doing the every two day application and am very impressed. I wish I had bought this 2 years ago. I had tried other things, like the gloves, and nothing was working. Thank you Mavala!"
4,It works!,"It worked with the first use. The bottle gets stuck when trying to reopen...worse than any of my nail polish bottles. But, my little one has stopped sucking her thumb!"
5,works,You defently won't bite your nails anymore. I use this on my boyfriend that couldnt stop biting his nails. He has now stopped . I reccomend this to any body!
5,Great product to break thumb sucking,"I have a 5 year old son who had quite a thumb sucking addiction. After hearing finding this product online and reading product reviews, I decided to give it a try. It was so easy...just apply a thin layer of this clear nail-polish like liquid on the thumbs, and it worked like a charm. My son stuck his thumb in his mouth only a couple of times after we applied this, and it tasted so bad that it kept him from doing it again. It also stays on for several days, so it only needs re-applied every 3-4 days. After about 5 applications, it had done the trick. No more thumb sucking. And my son is pretty proud of that too!"
3,Mavala Stop Review,"This didn't altogether work for us like it did for so many of the reviews that I read before purchasing it. My son is very persistent and stubborn so when we are met with behavior that needs changing it is always difficult to find the solution. It somewhat deterred him, mostly because of the idea of it I think, but I had to reapply it daily and two weeks into the whole process he is still biting his fingers and nails albeit not quite as often as prior to our using Mavala. I think that it would work on other kids who are not as willful."
5,This will work if you actually want to quit,"I think the key to me quitting was realizing what I was doing before I got started. I would put my fingers to my mouth without thinking about it when I was stressed for the first two weeks. The immediate terrible and lingering taste would remind me what I was doing and allow me to stop it. It will definitely make you wary of putting a finger near your mouth. I licked some sauce off my finger when I was cooking one night. BIG MISTAKE. This stuff is truly foul. I didn't paint my whole nails with it. I would just apply a little to the tips of my nails and cuticles every few days. It is a little shiny, but it looks a lot better than having mangled nails from biting."
5,The greatest,I brought this product last month for my 6 yr old daughter whom was a thumb sucker. My daughter stopped sucking her thumb after the first application. I still put in on her fingers once week night to be on the safe side. I should have bought this a year ago.
5,Great Product!,"Works wonderfully as long as you apply it every two days or else the taste (which is awful) will go away and the habit will continue. This has been the best thing ever to stop thumb sucking with my kids and Ive tried everything, even a $500 mouth brace the dentist recommended for stopping thumb sucking."
4,Two Day Fix,We've been trying to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb for a year now. THis did it in two days. We put it on and told her that her fingers would make her mouth taste yucky if she put them in her mouth. She agreednot to and ofcourse a few minutes later ran to her bed and lay down saying she was sick. She was holding her saliva and admitted that she had put her fingers in her mouth we drank and spit and she has not (after those two days) put her fingers in her mouth- one application was all it took.
5,PERFECT CURE,"I am so happy I bought this. I love that it is applied ONLY ONCE every two days. And YES it does last that long. It is NOT harsh on the skin, nail, or mouth. My Daughter hasn't even tried to suck her thumb after the first day."
5,Success at last!,"This is a wonderful product. I purchased it for my daughters. One of them sucks her thumb and the other bites her nails. After 7 days or so, my youngest is no longer sucking her thumb and my oldest actually has nails. I would recommend this product to any parent seeking to convert thumb suckers and nail biters."
2,high hopes but not enough,"I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews of other users, but it did not turn out to be effective for my son's nailbiting problem. He said it tasted bad, but not bad enough for him to keep his fingers out of his mouth. I've tried other nail bite products that also were not effective. This one seems to have been a little more offensive than the last one we tried, but it's not strong enough for a compulsive nail biter."
4,ok with it,"Good: It works- I accidentally put a very little amount(more like a little dot!) on my finger when I was paint this over my kids fingernails when they were sleeping.Oh, man- even that little dot tasted SOOOOOOOOOO bitter- that I shuddered like crazy.Bad:It's super expensive- Holy molly.... why does it need to be this expensive? ? especially you don't even need the whole bottle!!!!and another thing....My daughter, as soon as I put this on her fingernails, she stopped biting/sucking her fingernails for a couple days.BUT- a little later, She started sucking on OTHER part of her hands.... like licking on the back of her hand, or sucking/biting on her knuckles or something.well, I can't put this shiny nail-polish-looking thing on her knuckle or her whole back of her hand, can I?Anyway-This product, itself is a great one! but I think it's over priced."
2,It was worth a try,"My 4yr old son doesn't even want to stop and we have tried about everything. I read great reviews and ones that said it didn't help. Figured it was worth a try. He stopped sucking his thumb for 2 days, we applied it morning and night. Then he just didn't care and went back to sucking his thumb. I admit, when I first noticed him sucking it again, I licked his thumbnail and ICK the Mavala Stop was still on as strong as ever...he just sucked it anyways. On to something else I guess."
3,Did not work for us,This is not my first try with this sort of theory. I was hoping this product would be much more terrible tasting than the last product I tried but it seems the same. My daughter just sucks it off even when we painted the entire finger.
1,Works as well as anything else............,"I was hopeful now that my son is 8, this product would have worked. When he was 3 we tried it and he would just cry and lick right through it. I thought maybe now that he's older he wouldn't want to suck the thumb bad enough to have that awful taste in his mouth. Unfortunately it works as well and Tabasco, Wasabi, regular nail polish, none of it works. I'm pretty disappointed, my last resort is to have the dentist put an appliance in his mouth that will cost me 500.00, after insurance, to hope it will work. Just worried about his teeth."
1,Stopped working after a week,"We bought this product for our thumb-sucking daughter. For one week, we put it on, and she refrained from sucking because of its taste. The second week, the taste wasn't there so she went back to thumb-sucking and is now a more obsessive thumb-sucker then before we used the product."
1,Not working for my 2 1/2 year old,This product is not working for our 2 1/2 year old daughter. I put it on her tonight and she waited about 5 minutes and then put her thumb in her mouth. Has anyone had it not work?
2,Didn't work for my baby,It worked only on the first day and then started swolling this from the next day.. no use.
1,This is a horrble product,"I bought this for my son first off it didn't stop him at all. When I put it on him I also put ONE swipe on my nail to see how it worked or tasted. I understand it's supposed to taste bad. The taste was not what I expect it. It wasn't like you put her finger in your mouth you taste it. Everything your hand touches gets covered in it. With ONE swipe on my finger I tasted it for DAYS on everything. It made all my food taste bad, I couldn't lick my lips or put anything in my mouth with my hands. I could see why it didn't help with thumb sucking since I couldn't tell what was causing it. So there is no way a child could go, Gosh my finger tastes bad it was like Everything in the world tastes bad. My snacks, my lunch my lip, my thumb or figures. Everything...."
2,Concern mom,"My daughter sucked her thumb since she was born until she was 4 1/2. The problem with my daughter was that she would suck her thumb in the night, so she wasn't' even conscious that she was sucking it. She kicked the habit when we bought the thumb guard. It is a device you put in the finger. It was created by a dentist. It is unfortunate amazon doesn't sell it. I am not allowed to write the url in this comment so I'm just going to tell you that if you search in google for thumb guard created by Medetal you are going to find it. Good luck!"
1,Doesn't Work,"My 5th grade daughter bites her nails. She wanted to try this product in hopes it would help her stop biting her nails. However, she says that it doesn't taste that bad, and she continues to bite her nails anyway. (I personally think it tastes awful, but I'm not the one with a nail biting problem.)"
3,Wears off quickly,This product is not as bad tasting as the Stop Bite that you can get from the local drug stores. It wears off relatively quickly and has to be reapplied at least once a day.
4,Great stuff!,"I gave my 7 and 10 year old (yes, 10) sons the chance to quit their thumb sucking on their own with the threat of ordering this stuff if they didn't. They pretty much laughed at me. When it came in the mail, I snuck into their room that night and applied it. Around midnight that night, they came wailing into my room, crying, screaming, rolling around on the floor saying they were in agony-- my sons are drama queens. It has worked like a charm. They haven't sucked their thumbs since, and they were hard core. It's been months now, and we are a thumb-free family now. Great stuff!"
1,WORTHLESS!,"My 4-yr-old bites her fingernails and toenails. I bought Mavala, put it on her fingers and toes, and she goes right on biting, even 2 minutes after I apply it. It is worthless."
5,Eight year turmoil,"This product ended an eight year turmoil, we tried thumb gone, a thumb guard inserted by the dentist and a plastic thumb guard that I ordered off the internet. Nothing stopped my child from sucking her thumb until now. This product is amazing."
2,Not bitter enough!,We bought for our 5 year old son to help him to stop sucking his thumb and biting his nails...it didn't work for us. He was sucking his thumb and biting his nails as before.
5,amazing!,"We used Mavala Stop once, a month ago, and my three year old son has not sucked his thumb since. We did put it on his thumb a second time, but just for good measure. He hasn't even acted like he wants to suck his thumb!"
3,Mavala Stop (Nail Biting Deterrent),I purchased this for my 11-yr-old daughter to try to get her to stop biting her nails. I was happy that the taste of the product was a deterrent for her but disappointed that I have to reapply it every 2 days. Mavala Stop (Nail Biting Deterrent)
5,CAnnot believe this!,I have biten my nails for as long as I can remember and this is the only thing that has stopped me from biting my nails
1,not what I was hoping for!,"I read some reviews that made me hope this would be the cure for my 5 year old daughter from sucking her fingers. I personally think this stuff tastes nasty, but my daughter will still suck her fingers, even with this stuff on. Doesn't seem to phase her. We had also tried ""Thumb"" which also didn't work. Mavala seems very similar to Thumb. We probably should have started trying this stuff when she was younger. Thumb worked for two of my other kids when they were two year olds to wean them from their binkies. It may help you, but didn't work for us :("
2,extremely nasty but not nasty enough,"I feel bad giving this a 2 star because if it were me, I wouldn't put my finger in my mouth with this stuff on. My 3 year old son is a thumb sucker. I am trying to stop his habit now before it messes up his teeth. I bought this stuff because of the reviews. It worked for about a week and a half. I thought it was great and recommended it to my sister in law. Right after that, he started sucking it again. I guess he got used to the awful taste. It is so bad and stays on so good that if he touched my lips with his thumb, I could taste it for a good 15 min. I would still recommend this product. It is worth the money to see if it works for you. I just wish they had different awful flavors..... Now we use bandaids and that is working...."
1,Not what I was hoping for....,I had high hopes for this product after reading all the reviews...my 3yr old son loves his thumbs !!! 1st it was a pain to keep him still while i waited to the stuff to dry. then he would pick it off his nails..then he just got used to it and would suck his thumbs anyway. really bummed it didn't work...1st two days it worked but after that it was a no go. :-(
5,Worked for my son!,"I only had to use this once for my 4 year old. This and the Bernstein Bear's book ""The Bad Habit"" helped him stop biting his nails for good. Worth the price even for just one use!"
5,I'm truly amazed!,"Before purchasing this product, I'd read numerous reviews as to its effectiveness so I was confident that it would work for us. Our daughter, nearing four years of age, has been a habitual finger-sucker (pinky and ring fingers together) ever since we weaned her off the pacifier at about 6 months. I was expecting the use of Mavala Stop to be an emotional battle that might take a week or so to win. But, this stuff literally worked OVERNIGHT! After perhaps a couple of brief fusses following attempts to put her fingers in her mouth, she was trained. Two days later we applied it once more just to be safe, but I don't think she ever tried again. This stuff is nothing short of miraculous!"
5,Yes it worked!!!,"Yay, I bought this for my 4 yr old son, who sucked his thumb ALL the time. Yes it worked great. Though here is the warning...the first two nights were miserable!!! He woke up several times because he put his thumb in his mouth and it tasted awful, therefore, he kept needing a drink of water. After several days, he was cured! No thumb at all!!! He tells everyone that he is a big boy now and doesn't suck his thumb. He is very proud of himself.It has been over one month, and I do have to say we are still adjusting. Before, when he threw a tantrum, he would cry for a couple of minutes, and then soothe himself by sucking his thumb. Now that he doesn't suck his thumb his tantrums seem to be bigger, and last a lot longer. :( But over all, I bought Mavala to help him stop sucking his thumb, and it definitely worked, so I will give this product 5 stars. Good Luck to you. :)"
5,Works,We put this on our daughters nails and she hasn't sucked her thumb since. Make sure you only put in on the nails. Some of it got on her fingers and made her sandwich taste bad.
4,Works great (for some),I have a pair of 3 year-olds and this worked great for one but not the other (she was just determined to suck her thumb no matter what!).
2,Not good for thumbsuckers,My 3 year ond's dentist reccomended this to stop thumb sucking and it did not work at all. It taste TERRIBLE!!! but he will just sit there and suck it all off. It actually made him suck his thumb more because it made him focused on it. I think the best thing is just to ignote it until he gets old enough to want to stop. He is actually doing better with this approach.
2,Sorry! Didn't work,Thought this would be a cheaper way to help our daughter stop sucking her thumb. After the first couple of nights. the flavor wasn't enough to stop her. On to the next suggestion.
1,Disgusting.,"This product was tried on a thumb sucker and a nail biter. It did not work for either.I felt terrible after using it, it made my 7 year old vomit. As for the thumb sucker, he didn't care, he just kept right on sucking his thumb. The smell of this stuff is very, very strong. If the child touches ANYTHING, the taste and smell will get on that item. If your child, for example, is going to eat a banana, they will get the taste/smell of this in their mouth/nose. When it is on, it's hard to have their hands even near your face, it's so disgusting. I would never put this on another child. Even as an adult, just lifting your coffee cup to your face you'll be able to smell it, get the taste, from your hands. We can't recommend this for any child and will keep looking for solutions to our thumb sucker and nail biter. I was hopeful after reading the reviews, but we are deeply disappointed. This is just awful."
5,worked or us!,"My daughter is seven years old. We have been trying to break the 'thumb-sucking' habit since age 5. This product was recommended by our pediatric dentist. It worked for us! It is cheap, and worth a try. Good luck!"
1,There needs to be a remedy! It ruined our entire night!,"I can't believe they don't list a way to take the stuff off once it's put on. I tried nail polish remover and several washings with soap. It's now almost 10pm and my son can't get to sleep. He initially threw up and continues to dry heave every few minutes. Now he just wants to suck his fingers and go to sleep, but he keeps forgetting and putting them back into his mouth only to start heaving again! There's no way to soothe him. This should not be on the market without a remedy!"
1,Not impressed,"I read all the ""great"" reviews and was hopeful this would help my[...] daughter stop sucking her thumb. The very first night I used it, she was sucking her thumb within 2 hours. I have tried it for 4 nights and applied more each night, but it did not help. This product may be helpful for those who bite their nails, but did nothing to prevent my child from sucking her thumb."
5,Great product!,"I didn't think there was anything that would so effectively and safely discourage thumb-sucking, but this product did. Almost instantaneously, my daughter had a strong aversion to it's taste, and is now more focused on not sucking her thumb. We did need to apply it to her fingers as well, because she tried to bypass it, but quickly realized that would not work. I like that this product stays on a for a few days like a nail polish, and can't be wiped off, as some enterprising kids will try to do. Overall, an A+!"
5,Just what I needed,"I started using Mavala when my fingers started hurting of so much bitting, I had to stop some how, I found Mavala online, I liked the reviews and decided to give it a try, and I got to say, my nails are long now! my habit of bitting my nails had to stop as the taste of this product is terrible and so hard to get off. I only had to use it twice in two weeks, now with the longer nails I don't feel uneven edges neither the urge to bite them off. I keep it handy in case I need it again. I would highly recommend it!"
1,Doesn't Work,This didn't work for my 2 1\2 yr old. I tried it and it is nasty tasting but not for her.
3,Didn't work on our boy,"I tried the product on my own hand, it's very bitter. But no matter how much I applied the product to my son's trumb, it didn't stop him from sucking. He's not afraid of the taste, he even asked me to put on ""yikie"" for him. I wish there is another flavor like spicy because my son is afraid of spicy, more than bitter taste."
3,Good enough,"This product's online catalog information doesn't say that it is only for 3+ years but the label on the box says so. I still tried to use it for my 1 yr old daughter, looks like she is having a real strong intent of ""thumb sucking"".. so, mavala helped to stop a bit but we could not use it full fledged as the box says ""only for 3+ yrs""... need to wait for 2 more years and give a try if my daughter continues her thumb sucking habit."
4,"It works, but It doesn't cure the bad habit.","My son is 16 years old and he ALWAYS chews his nails. His nails are pretty much gone. you only see fingers w a huge head :) This helps him to not to chew his nails bc of its taste, but when he doesnt have it on, he has his fingers in his mouth. I just bought the 2nd bottle. He may, probably, needs to be hypnotized to stop chewing his big headed fingers... :)"
3,Worked well at first,"I was very excited to receive this product for my 5 year-old daughter. The first time it was applied we had great success. Then, she realized she could just keep licking her finger until the yucky taste went away. It does deter her for a while, so we will keep trying. She will suck any of her fingers or thumbs, so this was our last resort before heading back to the pediatric dentist."
2,limited effectiveness,"This product worked great for a week but my extremely determined 3 year old is now back to sucking her fingers. The product is extremely bitter (I tested on my fingers first) and an instant deterrent, however, a bit after a week my daughter got used to the taste (I didn't) and would stick her fingers in her mouth a few minutes after I applied the product. I would ask her how her fingers tasted and she replied, ""bad"" but was determined to stick her fingers in her mouth anyway. Needless to say, we are now looking for another product."
1,no match for my daughter,me and my husband were excited to get this product because of the wild reviews saying how strong it was. wrong. my daughter sucked the very bitter flavor off her thumb soon enough and is back to her merry thumb-sucking ways. wish us luck saving up for ortho costs years from now.
2,Didnt work on my daughter,"We were really excited to hear about this product because our almost 3 year old daughter has been sucking her thumbs for about a year and a half now. She does it throughout the day and when shes tired. The reason my husband was so insistant on getting her to stop is because she keeps scratching huge gashes on the bridge of her nose and then picking the scabs and he is afraid of scarring.The Mavala worked the first day, but by the 2nd day she was sucking her thumbs again. We reapplied multiple times a day and she would get upset but then suck them anyway. Sadly, we are one of the few unsuccessful stories for this too good to be true product. :("
2,Doesn't Work If You Have a Young Kid,Worked for the first week but no longer works. He just pushes through the flavor to bite his nails and suck his thumb. Very expensive product for a short term effect. Probably works well for adults and older motivated kids. Not effective for my 5 year old even when we painted twice a day.
3,Mavala - stop thumb sucking,"Mavala works - but, takes awhile to work. Not too happy about the shippng charges - costs more than the actual product. But, I couldn't find it in a store near me."
3,"Helps stop nail biting, but has glossy appearance","Does the job and is effective, however it was unexpected to find it looks like glossy, clear fingernail polish when applied. If that was known, it probably would not have been purchased."
2,hard for son to eat,Good idea in theory but my son cant eat any food without a fork because of the terrible taste. Not useful because of this !
4,Did the job,"We only had to use this twice before my 11 year old daughter quit sucking her fingers. That said, I am not sure it was really the Mavala Stop that did it so much as her orthodontist telling her she would end up with so much damage they would have to do painful surgery to correct it. That really motivated her; the M.S. was more of a reminder not to do it (like when asleep). As many others have said, it DOES make finger food taste terrrible."
5,Mavala Stop is incredible,"This product is outstanding! We tried everything possible to help our preschooler stop thumb sucking. Nothing worked. We heard of a product called Thum. It's applied on the finger nail and deters thumb sucking. Do not buy Thum. It is incredibly mild and had no impact on breaking my childs habit. Its made with Cayenne pepper and actually tastes good! Mavala Stop is applied the same way as Thum, however it literally stopped our child's thumb sucking habit on the spot. It the worst thing I've ever tasted and I can only imagine how bad it tastes for our kid. Just to be sure the habit was gone, we applied a new coat every two or three days for about a month. Buy this product if you have a toddler or preschooler with a thumb sucking problem."
4,Tastes terrible but didn't work on my daughter,"My almost-three-year-old daughter has been chewing her nails since we moved out of state. She adjusted very well to the new place and made great friends but would not quit biting her nails. I bought this after reading the reviews and was optimistic that it would work. Well, it worked for a few days (and I put it on every day) but then she just didn't care about the taste (and trust me, it tastes bad. I somehow got a taste of it) and kept on chewing her nails. I should mention that my daughter has eaten birthday candles and play-doh as a toddler, not as a baby. I think it would work on most kids, it just did not on my waxing-eating, play doh-eating child.Update July 2011I gave this a try again about two months ago (my daughter is now almost four), and after about 4 days, my daughter quit biting her nails. A week after that, I clipped her nails for the first time in 18 months! Yay!!!"
5,Very Positive Results,"After being an extreme nail biter for 60 years and learning to hide my nails to where it became an art form, I tried using Mavala Stop and it worked right away. The taste is so bitter and lingers in your mouth for so long that you just stop biting. I now have long nails and it is so wonderful to write a check at a store or unpeel some old tape without being embarressed. I'm an Operations Manager for a large company and I now exude confidence when people look at my hands. I highly recommend this to all nail biters. It might be a tad bit strong for young children."
4,chronic nailbiter,"I am a chronic biter for mg entire life. After purchasing mavala stop I started seeing my nails grow longer than I ever remembered! After about a month of not biting I stopped using it, and unfortunately the bad habit kicked in yet again. My advice to nailbiters is that this product DOES work. But dont believe the folks who claim it takes 30 days to break a habit. Get in the habit of slobbing this stuff all over your fingers for at least three months. Let your nails grow long and keep putting mavala on."
5,Unbelievably effective,"We tried every behavior modification we could think of, then tried ones we read about, then consulted a dentist. Nothing worked, be it positive-only reinforcement or otherwise. Our 4 year old daughter couldn't stop sucking her thumb.While we are usually quite skeptical of simple sounding remedies, I can honestly say this is the closest thing to a miracle drug I've seen. Overnight it stopped. She cried once when she didn't think about it and put her thumb in her mouth. That was it. We are going on 4 weeks now. Unbelievable."
5,Just what this family needed - worked in one day.,"My almost 3 year old was chewing his fingernails and toenails so badly that they would bleed. He would then move on to the skin around them. It was painful and looked horrible.In ONE DAY, he no longer attempted to put his fingers or toes in his mouth.It worked for my 10 year old until he discovered that he could soak his fingers and scrape it off the nails. I solved that problem by re-painting after bathtime.It's been over a month and I only had to apply it for about a week and a half. No more nail biting in this house!The taste is very strong and it lingers. I tried it myself and it took about five minutes to get the taste to go away completely.I'm convinced that this product saved my baby boy from pain and potential infections."
5,Really works,I found this on amazon just before we were planning to get a 600 dollar device put in my 7 year olds mouth to stop thumb sucking. We had tried everything! Just went to the orthodontist and dentist and they were both amazed and were sure to write down the name of the product. Her teeth have moved back a bit in the 3 months since she stopped! I think the fact that it makes one gag really associates with the habit and helps break it. It may seem harsh but my daughter is really proud of herself.
5,Long nails,This has helped to prevent my child from biting their nails. It is very bitter so use only the smallest amount and I think you will have good results.
5,THIS WORKS!,"My 5-year old had a horrible nail biting problem- couldn't stop putting his fingers in his mouth, biting his nails as soon as they grew long enough, etc. It was difficult to watch. I had tried other products like this, but nothing worked. Within a WEEK of our first application his nails were growing and he was no longer putting his fingers in his mouth! Now a month later, we're just about ready to cut his nails for the first time ever. Of course, we used a lot of encouragement and positive feedback as well...but he is now so proud of himself that he was able to get this habit under control. Definitely recommend this product FULLY!"
2,Works pretty well at the beginning....,"I initially reviewed this and gave it 5 stars after about a week as my 3 year old son had virtually stopped sucking his thumb about 90% of the time. But, he quickly learned how to suck through the smell/taste and now does it all the time. So we've stopped putting it on him and will try again in a few months. We may resort to the clear cast thing for night time. I have no idea what we'll do for daytime if this stuff doesn't work."
5,Long lasting,12 y.o. son says it tastes bitter for about 20 minutes after he tries to chew fingernails. Tastes bad any time he puts his fingers in mouth. So it's working.
5,Fair price for a GOOD product,We've found this product useful to us as a family... for the pricetag you shouldn't expect much but if its worth stopping a bad habit what could you lose?
2,Didn't work for us,We went through the entire bottle of this and my daughter is still sucking her thumb. At first she hated the taste and would suck her fingers instead. Then we put it on all of her fingernails so she started biting her fingers. We cut her of that habit before she could get addicted but somehow acquired a taste for the Mavala Stop and now sucks her thumb with or without it. I guess we'll have to resort to something more before she causes permanent damage.
2,Did not work for me but maybe a good product for others,"This scent seems to have been a bit more offensive than the last one we tried, but it's not strong enough for a dedicated nail biter. I had optomistic hopes for this product based on the reviews of other users, but it did not turn out to be effective for my daughter's nailbiting problem. She said it tasted gross, but not bad enough for her to keep her fingers out of his mouth. I've tried other similar products that also were not effective but maybe it is good for others."
4,Mavala Stop Review,"This stuff tastes awful, as it should(I had to try it before giving to my son). Our son just turned 4, and the dentist told us it was time to stop the thumb sucking. We had tried other things (""Thumb"" and hot sauce), but unfortunately he likes spicy stuff. The dentist recommended Mavala Stop, and we've been using it for about 3 weeks now. It works, but does wear off towards the end of the day due mainly to hand washing. It's by far the best thing we've tried."
3,MAVALA,"This is a great product for most, although the contents (ingredients)are a little scary, by the second day my two year old learned to have an aquired tatse for the product. It is very nasty and fowl tasting and will probably work for most, just not my stubborn child."
1,Didn't work for us!!,"After all of the great reviews I thought for sure this would help my 9 year old son stop biting his nails. It worked for maybe a week and he was right back to it. The taste no longer bothers him - so for our family, it was a waste of time and money."
1,Can't stop my nail biting kids,My three year old is autistic and she has a huge problem biting her nails so I took a gander on these and decided to try them out. I gave it a taste first and it reminded me of what finger nail polish would taste like but it was pretty bad. My three year old at first didn't like the taste but a day later she became immune to it and it had no effect. I am sure this product would work for some people just not for me or my daughter. Nail biting is a habit for me and I never noticed the taste since it was such a habit I didn't think about when I did it. I have found a new method in which I chew gum a lot but I can't chew all the time so my system is flawed.
1,Just didn't work in my case,"In my case, this did not work for my 11 year old son. We'd tried several other products over the years also to no avail. We'd hoped after a few years and matured taste buds that we'd try a nail product again. His dentists and doctors kept saying he'd quit 'when he was ready' but it's too difficult now. We thought this might help. It took him one day to get used to the taste. He's hardcore! We'll be moving on to the dental appliance now..."
5,Really Does Works!,"My son has been nail biting since before he was one year old. He is three now and after the first week of using this product his nails are growing and look fantastic. I have noticed in about three day this product wears off and he reverts back to the biting. Since this habit didn't start overnight, I expect it to take some time to break completely. I was skeptical before trying this product but now I strongly recommend it. I finally can see there is light at the end of the tunnel for my little nail biter."
1,not for determined thumb suckers,"I used this on my daughter(toddler) who is a very determined thumb sucker. Initially it looked like she stopped putting her thumb in her mouth, but after couple of weeks she started to put again.Now she is so used to this nail paint, she almost know when exactly to put her thumb back for sucking after the nail paint is applied.This product may be more suitable for little older kids but not for young toddlers."
4,"So far, so good","I was a little sceptical but hopefull about the results I would get with this product. My 3 year old son was biting his nails to the point that I was concerned that he would cause permanent damage. I was thrilled with the reaction of my son to the first time he put his fingers in his mouth after applying Mavala- YUCK!!! It has taken several weeks, but I have not observed him biting his nails at all (I don't know what he does during daycare). I am also happy to report that he now has enough new growth that I actually had to clip several nails. My son just started a new school so I will continue to use the product for the next few weeks in case he regresses to previous behaviors."
4,Miracle worker!,"I bought Mavala Stop for my three year old that was sucking her thumb. The first time I put it on her thumb, I put too much on and she got sick. I waited a couple of weeks and tried again. I only put a TINY dab on the end of her thumb the second time around. She didn't get sick and she quit sucking her thumb! She was a major thumb sucker before we used this product, so I was a little skeptical, but it really did work. I was very pleased with the results. Just make sure to not use too much. You don't want your child getting sick. This product is very strong, and a little goes a long way!"
2,"Didn't work for us, but worth trying","I had such high hopes, but to no avail. Our 3 year-old quickly figured out how to take a suck at her thumb and then take a drink repeatedly until the mavala was sucked off and she had rinsed the taste from her mouth. So, alas, it didn't work for us. However, I've heard great stories of success from others. Bottom line, the stuff isn't that expensive and much cheaper than other methods to get your kids to stop sucking their thumbs. It's worth a shot. Maybe it will work for you.On a side note. The stuff DOES taste NASTY. My 3 year old (for whom this was purchased), climbed to get the mavala stop on a shelf in the kitchen and then painted ALL of her baby sisters' fingers (baby sister was 9 months and a finger-sucker). We tried to get the mavala stop off of baby sister's fingers, but she still threw-up from sucking her fingers. LESSON TO BE LEARNED: be SURE the mavala stop is out of reach of even the most crafty toddler."
3,Did not work...,"I gave it 3 stars because it actually taste bad,the concept is good but It didn't work for me. My son said his fingers taste yucky but he was still biting his nails :("
5,Works like a charm!,Used for my 2 yr old daughter's finger sucking...I only had to put it on once and she actually only tasted it maybe twice! Very effective! Super-fast shipping too - thanks!
3,Not exactly guaranteed,Well I was told by our dentist that this stuff would guarantee our 4 year old would stop sucking her thumb because this tasted so bad. Well it definitely doesn't taste good but she has managed to suck her way through it. We will still continue to use it but it didn't work within the 2 weeks we were told it would
2,Stop nail biting,"Our four year old bites the skin around her nails and her nails when she is nervous. The first time we used Mavala Stop it tasted so bad she almost threw up. The taste also got on her finger foods and made her not want to eat. We only used it once as we thought the cure was worse than what she was doing. Maybe had we continued she would have stopped putting her fingers in her mouth, but at what cost? Making her nauseous is not worth it."
2,lid glues shut!,"If you wash your hands or use antibacterial stuff, it comes off so you must reapply about every other day. Worked for nail biting. Be careful with putting the lid back on---it stuck and my husband finally got it back open with pliers. So I just don't screw it back on completely. A bit too expensive. Will not repurchase. Found some similar stuff at Walmart for like $3."
5,Amazing product to keep kids from sucking fingers,"We purchased this after months and months of trying to get our 8 year old son to stop sucking his middle fingers. The first night, he stuck his fingers in his mouth and cried for about 30 minutes. He hasn't stuck them in his mouth again in over a week. This stuff has a horrible taste but it works like a charm. We've only applied it once. I would recommend it to anyone with an older child. Not sure I would use it on a young child under 2 or 3."
5,Very effective,Very effective solution. My daughter (4 years old) successfully quit nail biting in one week.
5,Works as advertised.,"I originally purchased this product because of my son. He's developed the habit of ""fiddling"" with his tongue with his fingers. Sometimes licking his hands as well. Unfortunately the Mavala didn't help with this particular problem. But as for nail biting and thumb/finger sucking, I'm sure it would work quite well. My son purposefullytasted the Mavala on his nails and described it as ""really terrible"". (He's 7 btw.) It's just that with his particular habit, he was able to avoid tasting the Mavala Stop."
2,Not for kids,"My 2yr old daughter sucks her 2 middle fingers, I read the review and ordered it thru amazon. I applied it on her finger nails and she tried sucking it and did not like the taste, after 2-3 attempts she got used to it and started sucking her fingers again. I paid $14 for no use. Try some thing else for kids, it migth be useful for adults."
2,Did not work on my little one!!,"My 4 year old bites her nails down to nothing. I read the reviews thinking this is my solution but was sadly mistaken!! I paint her nails every morning and by lunch the polish is off and my daughter is asking me to paint again. She actually likes the taste!! This may work on your little ones, but not mine!"
5,Worked like a charm,"The product arrived within 4 days. We got it for our 9 year old son who has had a constant habit of putting his thumb in his mouth. We encouraged him to apply it, so he was excited when it arrived. He applied the nail polish look-a-like product. When he put his thumb in mouth, he found the taste disguisting and tried to spit out the taste and water it down. Needless to say he didnt like the taste and the experience. He kept at it for 3-4 days and we would occasionally hear him during his sleep. BUT believe it or not, he has now completely stopped it. Once in a while, he himelf will let us know that he wants to apply it. We let him to do it, so that he is comfortable with it.We strongly recommend this product. This was told by our doctor."
2,Not for children under 3 years old.,The instruction says: Not for under 3 years old. This information is not to be found anywhere although the reviews suggest that this product has worked for 18month old. Not able to use it since my child is less than 2 years.
5,"Works exactly as claimed, and easy to use","My daughter has tried many products to stop biting her nails in addition to various rewards systems. Unfortunately, the habit had been so deeply routed, she couldn't stop biting - even with other bitter nail products. Others we tried had to be applied several times per day which led to inconsistent negative response when biting, or didn't taste bad enough. Mavala tastes horrible, and truly stays on for two to three days with multiple hand washings. Trust me, I accidentally got some on my lower lip and it lasted for days! Her nails are fabulous, and she is so proud of herself. This product is worth every penny for your nail biter, thumb sucker, and would probably work for the nose pickers too!"
2,Worked for a while.,This product worked for my son for a while. He stopped sucking his thumb for a day or two. Unfortunately he then decided he would just keep sucking his thumb until the stuff wore off. Also it seemed to give him diarrhea.
3,Hasn't been as effective as I had hoped,"Despite the nasty tasting product, my 8 yo dd still sucks her thumb. I don't think it's the product's fault, as much as it is my dd's stubborn determination to suck her thumb. If this didn't work, I don't have much hope for anything else."
4,finally!,after months of biting my nails down to the root and trying every product out there but i decided to one day ask my parents if i could purchase this to try another 1. at first they said no cuz nothing worked before but long story short i got it and holy crap it taste like an onion on stararoids. DISGUSTING!!! but hey it may be totally gross but im glad to say it has worked so far im so excited! thank you! i rlly recommend tryin this product!Awesome!
1,No Safety Seals???,"I purchased this item to help ease my daughter away from her finger-sucking habit. However, when the product came, there is NO safety seal on the outside box, and NO safety seal on the bottle cap. As a result, I'm afraid to use the product for fear of tampering or tainting. It's shocking to me that a product aimed for finger-suckers and nail-biters, and on the box states ""An effective deterrent for adults and CHILDREN"" has absolutely no safety seals to ensure the product can't be tainted or tampered with, in the long line of distribution from manufacturer to consumer!!! Very disappointed."
2,Didnt work out for us,I tried this with my 10 year old daughter to get him to stop nail biting. She stopped. But it rubbed off her fingers on to other parts of her hand face so she ended up tasting it even if she was not biting his nails. When that happened she refused to keep using it and who could blame her.
1,Stinky staff,"Purchased this for my one-year old and did not realize this is for older kids... much older! Beware, this staff smells like nail polish. It is very very strong! I would highly discourage using this on smaller children; thus, I have yet to use this. Maybe if she is 5 and still sucking her thumb :)"
1,Not for everyone,"I have a special needs child that continually bites his left hand. We have suspicions regarding neurological issues that fuel this compulsion. We tried this as a way to curb his hand biting in an effort to not have to resort to more drastic measures. It detered him for maybe 30 minutes ~ but that 30 minutes was filled with a HUGE meltdown after the initial taste was first discovered. While trying to restrain my son during this meltdown, I must have wiped my arm against my mouth and the taste is NASTY. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for at least 10 hours and that is after multiple teeth brushing and mouthwashings with Listerine. My son has SUCH a compulsion he happened to develop an aquired taste for it within an hour so it didn't happen to work for us, but we have Extreme extenuating circumsances."
1,"Nice idea, but NO success","We bought this for my 9 yr. old son who has Cerebral Palsy. We hoped it would discourage him from chewing on his hands. It didn't phase him a bit! I tried it on myself and felt sure it would work for Ryan--it really did taste nasty. He doesn't bite his nails, just his hands, so it was probably not the right product for us. We're still looking for a fix!"
1,Poison,"This stuff works--so would cutting your kids hands off. The residue of this chemical makes EVERYTHING taste terrible. If your kids eat food w/ their fingers, they'll soon starve to death. And it does not wash off. I got it on my hands and my dinner was wrecked. Fried chicken, egg rolls, crisp brocolli--all tasted like the chemical. Peeps giving this stuff 5 stars must have worked at auschwitz."
3,Didn't work for 2-year-old,"We tried this product for our two-year-old, and it didn't work at all. She just kept sucking her thumb, despite the yucky taste. It clearly says on the box not for children under three because they would be less bothered by the taste."
2,didn't work,This didn't work for us...my child would just keep right on sucking that thumb without missing a beat! We ended up getting a device at the dental office that actually helped stopped this habit. It wasn't cheap ($200) but it was the only thing that worked for us!
1,Didn't work for my little nail biter,"My little 3yr bites his nails terribly, and would even go at his toenails when he's done with his finger nails. It was easy to apply, smells horrible, tastes worse. My hubby complained about the lasting aftertaste it left. But after all that, my son still bites his nail. He did throw up from the first time he tasted it after trying to bite his nail. It deterred him for a day, but even after daily applications for a couple of weeks, he still bites his nails. So will have to find something stronger."
2,Doesn't work for everyone!,"My two year old daughter has been sucking the middle two fingers of her left hand since just hours after her birth. To avoid future embarassment for her and high orthodontia bills for me, I bought Mavala Stop to coat her fingers. The first night, my daughter DID keep the treated fingers out of her mouth. The next night, I found her sucking those fingers. The third night, after my daughter's bath, I coated her fingers again. Before the Mavala had even dried, she was licking her fingers like they were popsicles! So, it may be a great product for successful results with other customers, but Mavala Stop is not for us."
2,Too much shine,This product does what is states it will do but I can't use it for my boys because it leaves too much of a shine on their nails. One student at school asked my son if he had nail polish on!?! I can't use it on them and need to find another product with no shine.
1,DID NOT WORK AT ALL!!!,Very disappointed in this product:( With all the great reviews we were really hoping it would break our 5 year old of sticking his fingers in his mouth and chewing on his fingers. However it did not. He said it does not taste that great but did not stop him from chewing and sticking his fingers in his mouth. In fact it made it even worse! Sad i wasted $13.00 on this. Should have tried a cheaper product to start with....
4,"Great product, does what its supposetoo","I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because she sucks on her thumbs sooo much. We love this product since it does the job its supposetoo BUT!!! if you are using this for a toddler, make sure you have a bib or towl close by, my daughter is drooling all over the place. The first time she sucked her thumb, she gagged and almost puked,i kept a trash can near her so if she needs to spit she does it in there. This stuff works!!**UPDATE** my daughter i guess got amune to the taist, shes back to sucking her thumb :( i duno how!! because this stuff taist nasty! i must have one tough toddler.. :("
1,Wow DON'T GET THIS!!!!!!!,This product is terrible you can't eat with your hands like a sandwich without hating it!!!! It only lasts for a couple days and if you don't remember to put another application on you'll start biting again! Don't waste your money!!! It would have been much nicer if it didn't spread to food and it lasted longer... :(
5,This product is amazing,We decided to try this product because we couldn't get our 13 year old son to stop biting his fingers and our 5 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb. In the past 4 weeks we have had amazing results. Our daughter has stopped sucking her thumb even at bed time. Our son is doing a lot better with biting his fingers and they are healing. He even asks us now to paint his nail because he likes how healthy his hands are looking. I would recommend this product to anyone who is having a problem with nail biting or thumb sucking. It really works!!!
5,Worked Perfect!!!,"My son has sucked his 2 fingers his entire life until the age of 3-1/2, we started with a baseball glove, which worked only at night time, we then bought a product similar to Mavala Stop called Thums, this product did not work at all, has hardly any taste, I quickly ordered Mavala Stop after reading many good reviews, tested it out my self, then tried with just a small dab on one of his fingers, he stopped finger sucking within a day. Its been 2 weeks now, and he doesn't even attempt to suck anymore. Great product!"
5,Did a great job,"Actually this is my second time to use mavala stop,first with my older daughter and now with the second one both of them are thumb sucking,first time i use it when she is around 18 month(after asking her doctor)coz it says not recommend for less than 3 years but the doc said if u used once a week it should be ok,i used it once and she stopped immediately it was like a miracle,with my second i put for her twice,at the first time coz she kept trying to suck she throw out a little and she was very stubborn she keeps trying for 5 or 7 days but once she put it in her mouth she remember and stop trying until she completely stopped..."
4,"DEFINITELY WORKS, but caution","Exactly like nail polish, put a thin coat on the nail (as well as the surrounding skin), when you try and bite your nail, a really disgusting taste will STAY in your mouth, you'll want to wash it out with gasoline or old milk... hard to describe the taste, it's how I'd imagine french kissing the Queen of England would tastePROS-it works. seriously. I hate biting my nails now. It brings back memories of 'Nam, and I wasn't even born yet.CAUTION!CONS-you can't remove the taste from your nails right away, it'll slowly fade (usually gone by day 2 or 3, but you can reapply a fresh coat!), so if you're going to have any lady friends nibbling on your hands, you should probably warn them...-eating finger foods? not anymore. I had chicken pizza, touched the pizza with my Mavala-coated fingers, ate the pizza, and guess what I tasted. That's right.Queen Elizabeth II's tongue."
3,Be Careful,"I bought this product for my 2 year old daughter, I figured it was worth a try. I applied it to both of her thumbs and let them dry. She touched her thumbs to her other fingers. She put her fingers in her mouth and started gagging. I kept telling her to keep her fingers out, and she would be OK. Then, she threw up. About 15 minutes later, it happened again. This product seems to be very powerful, and I really felt bad after using it, since it caused her to vomit twice. I don't know how many more times it would have happened had I not removed the product. It seems to work, but with serious consequences for us..."
3,Not so impressed,"I wanted to get MAVALA Stop to help me stop biting my nails. It worked for about a week, but I could not stop biting my nails since it is such a horrible habit. The taste of it is disgusting, which kept me from biting a little, but overall it did not stop me. Biting my nails has been a habit my whole life, and it did not make me magically stop. Only buy this product if you will follow through and re-apply it every few days because it fades away easily. I recommend this product to help stop biting nails, but only if you can stick with it, which I was unable to do."
1,Does not work,"I applied this to my daughter and in three minutes flat she was already sucking her thumb, I asked if she hated the way her thumb tasted and she told me in was not bad! It might work for adults who eat their finger nails, but it does not work for the kids!"
2,Not Good!!!!,"This product is not worth the money. The product does taste horrible but it doesnt last long, maybe a day depends on how much you wash your hands. I wouldnt buy it from folica. This is the second time i ordered from them and they screwed up twice. When I ordered Mavala they sent me two in differnt packages and charged me twice and twice the shipping. I refused one of the packages at the door. And was only refunded for one product but still had to pay for the shipping one both. They say they dont refund shipping. They are hard to get a hold of too. I will never order from them again."
5,Hope for nail biters!,"Beware! This stuff tastes TERRIBLE! It also really works! Much, much better that other brands we have tried. I only have to apply it to fingernails once a day, after bathing. It lasts through hand washing all day."
2,Not as expected,"I bought the product for all the goods reviews I read, however it did not work as expected for my 3 yrs old girl. The product did only work during the first night, but my daughter hasn't stop sucking her thumb thereafter..."
3,Well.. It does make you regret puting your hand anywhere near your mouth,"I purchases this for myself to help me stop biting my nails. It does taste very bad, so it prevents me from mindlessly gnawing away while studying. The main downside is that you have to eat and if you touch your food with this on then your food will taste bad too. Even if you're not digging around in your food or licking your fingers, for some reason the bad taste doesn't seem to restrict itself to my fingernail where I painted it on. For some reason my whole fingertips tasted bitter too (maybe from touching my nails after they dried or rubbing them together during hand washing? b/c I was very careful when they were wet) and this transfers to food. I finally gave up using it because I became so frustrated trying to eat and prepare meals without making things taste poisonous. I was pretty careful to let them dry thoroughly and not touch them when wet but somehow the taste still was all over my fingers."
1,Unsuccessful,"It did not stop my 3 year old from sucking his 2 fingers, even tho he didn't like the bitter taste. Did not work"
4,It works.. but warning..,"This product definitely tastes horrible enough to stop you from biting your nails. It isn't a flavor that you're just going to get used to.. and it lasts. Product comes with instructions in English and pretty much every other language :) If you're like me though, and habitually just touch your face a lot and eat many foods with your hands.. you may be making a lot of bitter-mouthed faces during meal times. It's definitely worth the price to not just grow out your nails but break the entire habit.. just pay attention to what you eat :)"
5,Worked with one application!,"My son is 3.5 and has been sucking his thumb since birth. His dentist noticed some changes starting and recommended we get him to stop as soon as possible. We bought and applied the Mavala Stop one day and he made the mistake of trying to suck his thumb twice that day--immediately asked for water after! He never sucked his thumb again and we didn't even re-apply it! A few days after he tasted the Mavala Stop, he mentioned something about missing his thumb and wondered when he could suck it again. We told him he was all grown up and didn't need it anymore. We thought we might need to re-apply, but never did!"
2,Failed Attempt,"Unfortunately this did not make me stop biting. It tastes horrible but once you apply it its easily transferable to EVERYTHING! My food and especially when you're washing your face, I hated that! It felt like it was reminding me that I shouldn't bite but it was just too much to lick my lips or my girlfriend kissing me and we taste a horrible taste in our mouths that can't be so easily removed with water and soap. It might work for you but it surely did not work for me."
1,TOXIC! - You're a fool if you don't research the ingredients,"I almost purchased this product... I mean the reviews are stellar. It sounds like it really works and I wanted to buy it. Interestingly I didn't see reviews that questioning the safety of this product.I researched only the first ingredient, ""Ethyl Acetate,"" and here's is just a tiny excerpt of what I found on the osha.gov website...""Affects on Animals: Ethyl acetate is a respiratory tract irritant and, at high concentrations, it causes narcosis and depression of heart function [Hathaway et al. 1991]. The oral LD(50) for acute exposure to ethyl acetate is 4,935 mg/kg for rabbits and 5,620 mg/kg for rats; and the 8-hour rat inhalation LC(50) is 1600 ppm [Sax and Lewis 1989].""That's all I needed to see. You can read the rest of the article here:[...]I love my kid too much to risk using this crap, even if it does work."
2,Worked at first,"I used this on my 8 year old daughter. She sucks on her fingers when she is watching tv. At first this product worked well and I thought I was on the road to success. Unfortunately, after about 3 days, she returned to sucking her fingers. I started applying the product on her nails every day, but it didn't stop her. She even sucked on her fingers, just a few minutes after a fresh coat of the product was applied. So, for me this didn't work."
2,Undesired side effect!,"Well, this product was effective on our 4-year-old son. We only applied it twice. Unfortunately, it made his fingertips peel all the way down to his first knuckles! Once we stopped using it, the fingertips healed up just fine. Don't know if this is a common reaction, or if he just has a sensitivity to the chemical, but I definitely wouldn't recommend using it on small children with sensitive skin."
2,Spoils the food and leaves a bad taste for a long time,This product tastes very bitter (which is a good thing) but the taste doesn't go away for hours. The first time my daughter sucked on her thumb (after I applied Mavala) she was crying and spitting the whole night. I tried it too and I had a bad taste the whole night. And if my daughter dips her thumb in milk or water or any other food the whole thing gets bitter and can't be eaten. Not very happy with the product.
3,Not great for a kid,"We bought this product for my four year old. She likes to suck on two of her fingers on a particular hand and we had hoped to help her to stop. We explained to her while we waited for the product to arrive what would happen and she was very excited and happy. She has made comments that she wants to stop to. When we got the product we applied it to her fingers and it did taste nasty. It worked great for the first day. But while the box says to apply every two days, we discovered on the second day that it needed to be applied every 12 hours and then by the third day every 8. And by the fourth, it seemed to not have an effect on her at all. She may have gotten used to the taste or it may have been washing off, but either way, by the fourth day it wasnt working. A habit supposedly takes 21 days to break, but we didnt even make it past 4. I would not recommend this for a younger person. It may work on an adult though."
1,does not work,MY 3 year old daughter totally forgot this product was ever on her nail. And after using this product I noticed her hands are already dirty or bitter when shes putting her thumb in her mouth. I feel so stupid.
1,Stubborn Thumbsucker,Okay so i ordered this product hoping it would help my 2yr old and 4yr old with sucking there thumbs and bitting her nails so very disappointed because my 2yr has gotten used to the taste and now she still sucks her thumb i don't know what to do. the first day it worked great and after that it was over just simply hopeless i guess.
5,Thumb suckers - problem solved!,"I rarely ever write an on-line review but this product was so great that I have to recommend it!! My husband and I were desparately trying anything and everything to get our 2 yo to stop sucking his thumb. He loves to play in the sand box and we were concerned that he was going to get sick from the dirt on his hand. He was a thumb sucker from the beginning. We tryied to cover his hand in a mitten and putting a band-aid on his thumb... Everything suggested by parents on-line. We finally decide to try the Mavala product. Let me tell you it was like magic. the first time we put it on his thumb, He made a terrible face. After that he knew that his thumb tasted ""yucky"". I never saw him suck his thumb again. We put it on for a few weeks just to reinforce things and it worked like a charm."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this because of the positive reviews. My 3 year old sucks her thumb, and I am desperate to get her to stop. The product definitely smells bad, but my daughter just rubs it off and then sucks her thumb. I try to keep her from touching it so it has time to dry, but it doesn't seem to matter. It is a deterrent at best for us. Unfortunately, I won't recommend it. It might be a better product for a younger child who doesn't think to rub it off."
5,MIRACLE STOP IT SHOULD BE CALLED,"My 3 1/2 yr. old daughter started biting her nails. They were getting very low and I did'nt know how to make her stop. Then I came across MAVALA. I got it in 2 days of ordering it and I thought that was great. Then the test came to see if it worked. I told my daughter if you bite your nails below a certain point they are gonna start to taste funny. ""due to Mavala bitter taste"". I polished her nail with a color first and put Mavala on as a top coat. I then had her polish mine with Mavala so she did'nt think any thing was different. Well....with-in a day she STOPED biting her nails. She would bite her nails and say mommy my nails taste funny and run to get her drink. I felt bad due to the bitter taste but it worked in 0NE DAY! I tasted it to cause I wanted to know what she was gonna experience. It was bitterly gross. This works!!!"
5,Going good so far!!!,"I have a 3yr old thumb sucker and nothing was working. I decided to try this nail polish and it has been doing good so far. She thinks Im painting her nails so she has no clue that its for her to stop sucking her thumb. I haven't seen her put her thumb in her mouth since the first day I applied it, which she told me her finger tasted nasty! So lets hope this last and the thumb sucking ends :)"
1,Didn't work,"I was hoping from talking with people and the reviews on here that this would work for my thumb-sucking son, but it didn't even phase him. I don't think it tasted even as bad as the stuff you buy at Walmart."
3,"It worked, but over priced","I bought a bottle for my daughter (10) and myself to help us to stop bitting out nails. The flavor to me is bitter, but not a digusting flavor. It stays on the tongue for apx 10min. For me, it did help me to stop bitting my nails bc the taste would remind me to get my fingers out of my mouth.For my daughter, she doesn't use it everyday, so it hasn't helped her.....if she used it everyday, I'm sure that it would keep her from biting her nails. The problem is it has to be applied daily to get that bitter taste effect & she doesn't remember to apply it daily, or just doesn't want to.I do think that the price, $12.00 a bottle ,is a little over priced."
2,Didn't work for us,Bought this for our 3 year old. He ended up just biting anyway and the stuff seemed to wear off quickly once that started. We've tried is on several different occasions now over the course of a year and he still bites.
3,"Tasted bad as advertised, but didn't work well for us.","This tastes very bitter, as advertised, but that didn't seem to stop my daughter too much. When we first put it on her she avoided her fingers, but slowly got used to the taste and now it doesn't bother her at all.If your child doesn't get used to the taste this could work very well, but it did not for us."
2,too powerful,I tried this with my 12 year old son to get him to stop nail biting. He stopped. But it rubbed off his fingers on to other parts of his hand or face so he ended up tasting it even if he was not biting his nails. When that happened he refused to keep using it.
3,Didn't work for all my kids,"All my friends said this was THE product to stop thumb sucking. My three-year-old is a serious finger sucker. I put Mavala Stop on her fingernails and she just sucked on them anyway. She hated it, but she alternated between sucking her fingers and wiping her tongue on her shirt until the Mavala Stop finally wore off. I tried it for weeks and finally gave up because I was afraid it was bad for her. The only thing it did was prevent her from taking a nap during the day. However, it wasn't a total waste. It cured my 7-year-old son of nail-biting, but he refused to eat any kind of finger food during the process--no sandwiches, cookies, crackers, carrot sticks, etc., because it made the food taste bad. I tried it and it really is awful stuff. I was pleased with how quickly the nail biting was cured. This may be the best product on the market, but it doesn't work for everyone."
2,Nice idea... bad delivery,"Yes this will keep you from chewing your nails, it will also ruin a lot of other things. I was using this to keep my son from chewing clothing, and other things. While I had it I thought I would try it because I chew my nails a bit. Then I found anything I touched and trying to make dinner was impossible. Everything tasted like this stuff, had to stop using it."
5,Great for stopping finger sucking!,"We saw the reviews and we weren't getting anywhere trying to persuade our four year old daughter from sucking her middle two fingers (and causing her teeth to grow outwards), so we went ahead and ordered some! She knew she wasn't supposed to suck her fingers and was ok with us putting this on her fingers - we just put a couple of small dabs since it is quite strong and bitter. It worked like magic, one taste and the fingers never went near her mouth again, and we didn't even get any complaints about it. We saw her sucking her fingers about 3 or 4 days later and so we did a second application and since then (it's been over a week now) I haven't seen anything so can almost say she has been cured. This stuff is way more effective than anything else we have tried, and I highly recommend it. Better to do this than to spend thousands on orthodontists fees when your child is older!"
5,Works Great!,"I bought this about three weeks ago. It does not taste absolutely terrible, but the taste does linger in your mouth for a while if you accidentally bite your nails or lick your fingers.The problem with these nail biting lotions, creams, etc is that anything you touch becomes almost instantly contaminated. For instance, you can't really eat chips without tasting the bitterness in your mouth. If you try to take meat out of a cold meat container, you run the risk of contaminating the meat underneath. Eating a sandwich is a problem because the bitterness wears off onto the bread.So far it has been about 3 weeks and I have not bitten my nails. I actually have nails. It will take probably 4-6 more weeks for my nails to completely grow out but this is probably the first time in 29 years that I have real nails. I don't know what to do with myself!"
2,"Meh, not great","Thus stuff tastes terrible, I give it that. But if you have a smart child, they will notice that it gleams on their fingernails. It lasted one night on my five year old's fingers. Then he noticed the gleam, and started scratching the stuff off. It comes off like nail polish. So- complete fail for us. Maybe using it on a younger child would work, I dont know, but my 5 year old outsmarted the stuff almost immediately."
3,Worked.....Part Time,"I bought this product for my 2 1/2 year old who sucks his thumb. It worked for about 4 days until he got used to the taste then he was right back to sucking. We have held off re-applying it in hopes he will dislike the taste the next time i apply it, which will be very soon. Overall i was very impressed with the initial results."
5,"""STOP"", really works!","I needed someting to make my grandson to stop sucking his thumb, and bitting his nails. He is three ( 3 ) years old now and I was afraid of what this was doing to his teeth, and bitting his nails meant his fingers were in his mouth, and that means GERMS!!!!"
5,Really works!,"I put this on my daughter's fingers one week ago, along with some pale pink nail polish (for her liking) and she has not sucked her fingers yet. She knows the nasty taste from accidently putting them in her mouth while eating. She has only cried once and asked me to take it off....I told her I could not get it off and she was over it.I have also used it on myself for nail biting. It is a horrible taste, I do not want to bite!"
5,It actually Works!,"My five year old was a die-hard thumb sucker and this little bottle helped her kick the habit. She was resistant at first, but we told her it was magic and would help her to remember not to suck her thumb so when she went to kindergarten they wouldn't make fun of her. We are on week three and she's doing great. She needs that sucking sensation to soothe herself to sleep, so she has resorted to sucking a little on her middle finger, but we are trying not to make a big deal of it. We can't expect her to go cold turkey after 5 years. Anyway, I was skeptical, but this product is inexpensive and works great for my daughter. She hates the taste and she's kickin' the habit."
5,This works!!!,"This worked great! I had not cut my 5 year old nails in at least 2 years as he would eat them down to nothing. He stopped biting his nails after the first time we used it. I put in on every few days and after just 3 weeks, he stopped bitting his nails all together, even if I skip using the product for several days. Last night I had to cut his nails for the very fist time since he was 3! It does smell terrible when you first put it on but as soon as it dries (a couple of minutes), the smell is gone."
3,Works great... Until you get used to it...,I tried this product to curtail my nail biting. It worked great for a few weeks. Eventually I just got used to the taste and starting biting my nails regardless. At that point I just stopped using it.Don't try eating finger foods either... It ruins them.
5,Amazing,"I've never felt compelled to write a product review, but this time I couldn't help myself. My three year old was a prolific thumb sucker, and very strong willed. I didn't think this would work, or if it did, it would be a traumatic experience for the whole family. This product worked as advertised. My son was done even trying to suck his thumb within about two days. A three year habit killed in less than a week!"
3,"Good product, horrible shipping","The product does work very well and tastes really bad, but the shipping took a few weeks for me to get it. I would deff. recommend this product but get it from a different supplier."
5,Definitely BUY this!!,This is the BEST stuff I have found for nail biting!!! My 4 year old completely stopped biting his nails with this. I highly recommend!
2,Be Cautious!,"I tried this product myself before I planned to try it on my daughter's binkie. It definitely has a strong, bitter flavor that is really terrible! After reading the ingredients, however, I won't be giving it to my daughter. The first ingredient is Ethyl Acetate, and another ingredient is Isopropyl Alcohol. It recommends use for children over 3, but it doesn't sound like a good product for anyone!"
5,thumb sucking,"My 11 years old daughter suck her thumb since birth, tried everything even the dentist cage instrument was inserted in her mouth for one year to help her stop sucking her thumb but did not work. with Mavala she stoped sucking her thumb after 2 weeks. it was a big releave for me."
5,no need for cold turkey,"For 18 years I had sucked my thumb. I always thought, I could quit whenever I was ready but somehow could never stop. I was embarrassed for so long because it caused my teeth to poke out. Then one day, I saw this product on amazon and figured it couldn't hurt to try it. Within a week I quit an 18 year old habit and could not believe it. If this product can work for me then it can work for any one."
3,tastes aweful but baby got used to it.,it's really foul but my baby would still suck her thumb in her sleep dispite the aweful taste. she got used to it i guess. oh and i dont liek that the product gets on other stuff dispite that it's dry on her finger nails= like if hold her hand or soemthing and then i put something (food) in my mouth i can taste that icky stuff. I recommed ThumbGuards.
4,worked quickly,"This product stopped my 1 1/2 year old from trying to suck her thumb in a few days. However, she did get diaper rash for about a day after using this product."
5,A Miracle!,My daughter is now finished thumb sucking thanks to this product. We had to put it on maybe four times and she is done. So happy my dentist recommended this to us.
1,Did not work for our child,"We bought this for our 6 year old daughter who was still sucking her thumb as well as biting her nails. The product smells exactly like nail polish remover which for the first application stopped our daughter from bringing her fingers any where near her nose, let alone her mouth. But after a day, she went right back to sucking her thumb even with nightly applications."
3,Works great untill child figures out they can wash it off.,I first started using this product when my daughter was two and had a nail chewing problem. Then it worked great the chewing stopped in a matter of weeks. Now she is four and has developed a thumb sucking habit. The product worked great untill she realized she could wash it off. Now when I apply a coat before bed time I hear the sink running about 10-30 minutes later.
5,Works!,"This product works well, but you have to keep using it! lol! It tastes bad, and will get on whatever your fingers touch, including food. It also stays on your nails for days!"
2,still wondering how this product is?!?,"This was for my Nephew, but he doesn't seem to stop sucking his thumb?I honestly think he likes the bitter taste!!!!He sometimes does get frustrated with it at night and thats it.So in other words it may work for your kids but I won't but this again... Sorry"
1,Let Down,"I was extremely hopeful this would work for my 4 year old.. But after the first application, she simply would suck for a few moments, make a face and then back to normal.. I tried everything to make this work without making her sick.. Nothing worked. :("
2,"Was a nail biter, still am a nail biter","I've bitten my nails for as long as I can remember (I'm in my 20s) and I really wanted to kick the habit so I bought this product a few months ago. After I got the product, I used it every day/ every other day. About four finger nails had been growing pretty well (I was still biting the rest of them) but after the third week I went back to biting all of them. Even though the taste is disgusting (and my boyfriend threatened to not kiss for a significant amount of time if he could taste it on my lips), the taste didn't bother me as much after a couple weeks. I really want my nails to grow out and I wish this could do the trick!"
3,Too good to be true?,"I bought this product from Amazon for my four year old son. The last few months he's been biting his fingernails until his fingers bleed, so as soon as it came I put it on his fingernails. He objected and cried, and the first day he didn't bite his fingernails. On the second day he announced that he ""kind of likes the taste"" and has gone back to biting his nails anyway. Oh well, son 7, dad 0."
5,Mavala Stop worked for my 2-year thumb sucker,"My 2-year-old daughter started sucking her thumb when she was 4 months old, after I stopped breastfeeding. She'd only suck her thumb when she was tired or going to sleep. She has a big callous on her thumb because of it. I ordered this product and got it. I put it on her thumb nail during the day so she was aware of what I was doing. When she was eating some snacks with her hands, her thumb nail touched her mouth and she spitted all the food out because of the taste. But this product works. At night, when she was tired, she tried to suck her thumb and I told her it was 'foochi' and she understood. She did move around a lot trying to fall asleep without her thumb but then she did. The next day, for her nap and again at night, she didn't even try to suck her thumb. Its been 5 days now, and no thumb sucking. I have been reapplying every 2 days just to make sure there is no relapse."
2,well....,"i guess we are severe nail biters....beyond help....because this stuff didn't work. it washed off with water and my son figured that out pretty darn quick. after that, he would just scrape it off with his teeth and proclaim that he liked the taste. i tried it myself and it honestly doesn't taste that bad. i mean, it stays in your mouth for a bit but nothing unbearable. i've been biting for 32 years.....this isn't going to work for me. it does get all over everything you touch so be careful eating."
5,Outstanding!,Worked right away! My son stopped biting his nails immediately. It must taste terrible because it works. we had tried other products but this works the best.
4,Nail Biting,So far it is working well. Its been three days. The taste is very gross but you must apply it every two days or so. I hope it works and so far It has!
1,Concerned Consumer Advocate,"Right now I am looking for a nail-biting-deterrent polish. This polish seems to have high reviews but I would beware of this product. The product contains Methyl alcohol, which is highly toxic! (even in small portions)I am not Look at the ingredients! It definitely does not seem suitable for young children with developing brains!Comment away if you have some expertise to add to this!Be a consumer advocate!"
2,Didn't work for our kid!,"I had heard great things about Mavala STOP from many people and was so excited to try it to get our son to stop sucking his finger. As incentive, I painted some on one of my fingers and it was indeed VERY NASTY tasting. He licked his finger once and it was gross but not gross enough. He sucked it off repeatedly! We ended up stopping its use since it's so high in chemical content and he was basically ingesting it. Oh well."
5,works great,3 1/2 yr old sucked her thumb a lot. with in 2 wks she stopped. First four days she would wake up or start to go to sleep with the taste in her mouth a little bit of juice would help take away the taste. She never cried about it she just would say I have the yucky taste in my mouth and we would take care of it. I explained to her before using it what it was and what would happen if she sucked her thumb. very quick and effective.
2,"OK for day, didn't work at night","It does taste terrible and it was a pretty good deterrent for daytime, but we really needed something to get her through the night without sucking her thumb and this did not work. Painted it just before bedtime at 8:30 and when we checked on her at 11:30, the thumb was firmly embedded in her mouth. She did complain of a bad taste in her mouth in the morning, but that wasn't enough to stop it when she was sleeping."
2,Didn't work for long,"I have two boys, 7 and 2, both thumb-suckers. At first I thought this was a miracle product, until they got used to the taste and just went back to sucking their thumbs. My 7-year-old only sucks his thumb at night, and I tried putting it on after he'd fallen asleep, but he sucked his thumb anyway. My 2-year-old wants to suck his thumb constantly. I will apply it and it works as a deterrent for about an hour, then he just sucks his thumb anyway, so I end up having to reapply it and the cycle begins all over again. I guess I just have very stubborn children, because this stuff tastes so horrible and lingers forever in your mouth!"
5,interesting,"Full of ""gossip"" concerning some of our ancestors. See if you can find one of your ancestors in this book. A wonderful book and a fun read. I suggest that you buy it or at least try to find it at your local library. I really enjoyed it, and I found out some info. on one of my ancestors, suff that I didn't know about, and things that I wanted to know about. If you have the time, please read this book, and I promise you, you'll love it!"
1,Way too small to survive,"The plant may be great, but it was too small to tell. After several purchases, the plants remained too small to survive the shipping. All plants were very small, despite the photos. Take this into account before you spend money on this plant. You would be better to take a look at your local garden centers."
1,Non fiction is better,"I purchased this book because I play the role of Queen Margaret of Scotland for a Renaissance Faire, and I'm always on the lookout for more information about this character. The writing is plodding, the attitudes exemplified are very modern and not historically accurate, and many of the incidents related aren't really accurate according to extant letters from the time.A much better read is """"The Sisters of Henry VIII"" by Margaret Perry. It doesn't have 'conversations' between people and what they were thinking,like a novel, but it is far better written, easy to read, and uses scholarly references (that don't interrupt the narrative)"
2,Very simplistic,Although it is a nice overview of the life of Margaret Tudor the writing is not very good nor does it have as much historical information as it should. It reads more like a romance novel than historical fiction.
4,Sisters of Kings are Often Overlooked,"This novel did not have quite the spin that I look for in tales of the British Empire. I felt that the competition by the Opposition to the Queen did not have the logic that it needed. They remained the ""bad guys."""
2,Disappointing,"I was very interested in the topic, but I thought the writing was poor. Read like a text book - flat. I couldn't finish it."
2,"Good construction, but bad batteries.","The tape measure and the levels all seem to work well, and the body, levels and tape seem to be good quality.But, I, like others, received a unit with badly corroded batteries. I've cleaned out the old batteries and white corrosion from the battery compartment, and have ordered new MAXELL AG13 LR44 357 button cell batteries. I may either upgrade and downgrade my review after I have the new batteries installed."
2,works good but the batteries were corroded,"The tape measure and the levels themselves work good, extended to the full 25 feet and there were no issues with the tape retracting.however, the batteries were installed and severely corroded and leaking, the battery compartment had to be cleaned out.I have not replaced the batteries yet to try the laser as it is an extra expense that should not be needed on a new item that claims to include batteries.The magnet was broken on the bottom, defeats the purpose of having the magnet to hold the device in place.It does have a tripod mount on the bottom that could be used but who really wants to get out a tripod?Three Ag13 or LR44 type batteries are needed."
1,Tape laser.,"This is a cool tape but mine came not working. I took out the batteries to find them leaking and corroded. The magnet has the coating pealing off, most of it is gone. For the price I will get one somewhere else than go through the trouble of returning this one, just my luck I guess..."
1,"Not the real Butler's , not even an abridgement","This is not Butler's ""Lives Of The Saints"". It is ""Lives Of The Saints With Reflections For Every Day In The Year Compiled From The 'Lives Of The Saints' By Rev. Alban Butler'. It is not an edition of Butler's. Even to call it an ""abridgement"" would really be pushing it, but if it had been marketed as such, I would have avoided it in the first place and not have wasted my time purchasing it and then obtaining a refund."
3,saints,For a short history of the saints this is a good book. I would have rather read a longer description of each saint and their history.
2,Cliff Note Edition,"Way to brief. Not really the ""lives"" of the saints. I was hoping for a more in depth study of the saints"
5,An American hero of the Holocaust,"This little known gem of a Holocaust movie by Showtime is worth watching for its portrayal of an American intellectual, Varian Fry's efforts in rescuing Jewish artists & intellectuals trapped in Vichy France during World War Two. Although Varian's efforts were not publicly recognised until after his death in 1967, this movie showcases his heroism in a time when the US maintained a policy of neutrality in the war. Varian is played brilliantly by William Hurt and Julia Ormond shines in her role as the female assistant. The story moves along at a thrilling pace with Varian having to fend off the Nazis and the French securitate whilst undertaking efforts to transport Jewish refugees to Spain. Thanks to Varian Fry's little known heroism, the human race has been enriched by the works of such Jewish luminaries [amongst those he rescued] such as the artist Marc Chagall, and the author Hannah Arendt. A compelling film!"
3,Pistola Pictures,"A good ""movie of the week"" production about Varian Fry ( William Hurt ), an unlikely American hero, who helps a select group of european artists and intellectuals escape Nazi and Vichy facsists during World War II. The film sheds light on the old saying ""don't forget the French"" in ironic fashion. Vichy complicity with the Nazis during the occupation of France in this film is testament to the mortal danger so many artists, poets, scholars and writers faced while trying to escape. There are strong performances from Lynn Redgrave and William Hurt, so I would recommend it on this merit alone.[...]"
2,useless; will not teach you Perl,"This book is a reference, nothing less and nothing more. If you already know Perl and want a reference, you might as well get this one. It has a geeky mystique too it and a certain crowd will look up to you for owning it. But that's all it's good for. As a reference, it throws piles and piles of Perl special identifiers, syntax operators, and other stuff in your face without a single decent example. Even a master programmer will not learn Perl from such a presentation, any more than you can learn English from reading a dictionary. To actually learn the language, for those of us who buy books because we hope to learn something, try Learning Perl by the same publisher."
3,Binding to weight ratio is poor = book falls apart,"The content is excellent as before, but the book is way too heavy for the paperback binding. My copy, very gently used since purchased (mere 3 months, only desktop use) is on the verge of falling apart. So when reading or searching through it, I concentrate on keeping it in one piece, rather than on the content. And so, in most cases I prefer to use perldoc.perl.org instead. Which is a shame, because it has been such a great book! (I also own 2nd and 3rd editions).IMHO, the book should have been split into two volumes (my preference), or published as a hard cover edition. In it's present form, I do not find this book particularly useful. Despite, I repeat, the excellent content."
1,Only for the already initiated.,"This book:* Skips clear examples of how to do the most basic, common things in favor of examples that illustrate more complex arcana.* Has an index that does not direct the reader to the principal entry on any given topic.* Has a table of contents that lists general categories but not the subtopics one most wants to find.* Has chapters entitled ""The Gory Details"" and ""Other Oddments"", possibly betraying a lack of confidence on the part of the authors that they can explain things clearly and interestingly.An example of how poorly organized this book is: The index entry ""opening, files"" does not direct the reader to the section on the open function nor to any general discussion of how files may be opened or closed."
5,A Serious Language Book,"I recommend you buy a Perl book if you really want to learn Perl, and, buy this one. ""Learning Perl"" is also a good one. However, it covers too little of perl, not even references and modules. On the other hand, it says more about the interactions between Perl and other stuff, e.g., files, directories, processes, CGI... which is absent from Programming Perl.In a word, Programming Perl is a more serious language reference, and more likely to be frequently refered to."
2,This book has devolved with time,"Another example of a second-edition being much less worthwhile than the first. The first was good, solid, full of examples. Then O'Reilly decided they could milk the Perl market by splitting what you needed to know across three books. If you can find the first edition, but it. This new one is a waste of money."
4,"Wonderful book, but be carefull while reading it !!","I am student in Computer Engineering. So I found PERL Language the suitable entrance for web-based programming. After searching the web for books cover this task I found this book, really it is usefull, but I think advanced readers must have carefull while buying it, because - as I saw - it is completely oriented for beginners."
5,The Definitive Reference,"A great mix of practical examples, complete reference, and humor, this books is truly excellent. With this book alone, I learned enough Perl in a week to write very complex scripts. I am confident that anyone with a solid knowledge of structured languages could easily do so as well."
5,Not for beginning programmers but who ever said it was?,"If you don't have any programming experience then avoid this book. Perl is a very specialized language in which ""Easy jobs are easy and the hard jobs are not impossible"". If you are serious about Perl in any of its applications then this book is indispensible."
4,"Its the reference, but don't use it for learning","Unless you happen to have a degree in Unix and programming (I haven't anyway), don't use this book to learn Perl beyond Randal's Llama book (Learning Perl, excellent!). Programming Perl is a complete reference of the language but is was not made for teaching you Perl. Advanced Perl like references (actually everything after chapter 4) is quite diffucult to understand in the way it was written. Yes, I read the Llama book first but this doesn't mean you will understand the Camel. I would recommend:more examples (and their outputs)less focus on cool snippets (provide every day code)less C and Unix (Perl is mutli platform, why refer to a Unix man page instead of explaining a function?)try to find simple words to explain things.Not everyone is an advanced programmer but everyone should use Perl. Its a wonderful language."
4,Fabulous Reference,"While this book may not be the best way to LEARN perl, it is the ultimate reference book. As a professional perl programmer I still keep this on my desk both at home and at work! View my other recommendations at http://www.cgi-guy.com"
1,The worst programming book I know of.,"The only use for this book is if you -already- know perl well, and you want to read entertaining insights in a somewhat random order about miscellaneous topics. Do -not- get this book if you are new to perl, or if you have specific problems to solve, or things you want to do. For example, two common questions might be, ""How do I write a class?"" or ""How do I write a constructor?"" You won't find the answer clearly spelled out anywhere. You must persevere through pages of humorous text with side excursions and nebulous warnings before coming to the final explanation. Ditto for many other language features or common questions."
3,A Festival of Footnotes,"Eeesh, this thing reminds me of someone that just got a new word processor and discovered how to insert footnotes into their text. Just because you -can- doesn't mean you -should-.All in all an above average programming book but a little rough in places. Written in a rather informal tone it is really a pleasent read, much more than most programming books. Unfortunately the author makes the mistake of using concepts well before their introduction in the text, resulting in a rabbit-hunt for information. One example is 'my' which is refered to and used early in the second chapter (talking about file globbing) but not defined for 54 more pages! As a previous reviewer said this book is probably a great book assuming you already know the language! Unfortunately, I only know awk and sed, so perhaps I have a bit of a leg up, but woe be to the unitiated.O'Reilly has done better..."
4,Perldoc set to pulp...sans soul,"Like other reviewers, I was expecting the masterful style that pervaded the first edition (Perl v4). Maybe the sheer density of the subject matter (the many new features and object-orientation of Perl v5) precluded the tutorials and chatty approach of the predecessor. Gone are Job, his sons and daughters (Eyeshadow Kit!) along with much of Larry and Randall's humanity and sheer joy of the language. This is, however, a must-have resource for those who don't have the facilities to prepare a hard copy of the on-line documentation that comes with the Perl distribution. It's evident that the language has matured and become more serious. This tome reflects that evolution accurately."
2,Not as good as the first edition,"I was disappointed with the second edition of Programming Perl. The first edition taught me the language. It was rich with examples and simple explanations. The second edition, however, I find to be lacking in the examples of the first. Sure, it shows all of the functions, syntax, and other necessary things, but this book confirms something for me: the object-oriented features of Perl are ugly and are nothing but an add-on to the language. The structure and syntax are awkward and difficult to understand. Even when I am programming for a Perl 5 interpreter, I still find myself reaching for the first edition over the second edition.This is the first time I've ever been disappointed by a book from O'Reilly and Associates. The second edition is still an excellent reference and I do refer to it, but I'm keeping my first edition handy for its readability, examples, and better explanations. It may be a ""must have"" for Perl programmers, but don't discard your first edition."
2,Not for the Perl Beginner,"This book is a good reference if you really know what you are doing in Perl and want to just look up particulars on a specific function in perl, but it really bites when you are tyring to use it to answer any question like ""How do I do ____ in Perl?"" It reminded me of the age old question. If you can't spell a word, how do you look it up in the dictionary? I must say that the included brochure reference guide is a very good thing."
3,"Buy the 3rd edition, not the 2nd edition","I have owned every edition of this book. The 2nd edition was a lot better than the 1st edition, but it is not nearly as good as the 3rd edition. The 3rd edition is the best perl reference book that you can buy. Period."
4,Wonderful perl reference for programmers,"This book DOES assume you already know how to program.If you're starting completely from scratch, this probablyisn't the book for you. But if you know C or some otherlanguage and want to pick up perl with just the fundamentals,read the first couple chapters of general info and then juststart playing. The function references in this book aregreat."
1,Will fall apart after a couple of weeks,"This new version is about 1/4 inch thicker than the previous version. The type of binding (perfect binding) doesn't work with size. After a week of normal use, several of the signatures are becoming detached. The 3rd edition which I've had for about 2 years, is still in good shape even after a lot of use. The publisher either needs to go to a different binding method, or make this into two volumes. Sorry I had to rate this only 1-star. Content is excellent, but I wanted to point out how disappointed I was with the quality of the production. Personally, I prefer the hard copy (non-electronic) format since I enjoy sitting and reading chapters at a time."
2,Not a good reference book,"I find this to be a very frustrating and time-consuming book to use as a reference. The main complaint I have about this book is its astonishing lack of examples. No user wants to try to extract syntax from paragraphs of commentary. If you have the time and want to sit down and learn the ""theory"" behind Perl, then maybe this is a good book for you. Otherwise, look for a book with examples rather than expository."
4,"A Reference, Not a Tutorial","Not a beginner's book by any stretch of the imagination, it is the definitive reference written by the author of Perl. Everything you need to know about Perl is here, but you may have some trouble finding what you need. While it does a good job of covering the new features of Perl 5, this comes at the expense of explanation of some of the more basic features. In an effort to be complete, the authors have sacrificed some clarity. Still an essential part of any Perl programmer's library, but not the only book you'll want especially if you're just starting out in Perl. Beginners will still want to check out Learning Perl by Schwartz before tackling this one."
1,A terrible programming book I've ever read,"This is not a good book for a technical or a new Perl user. There's a few examples for new users and little programming information for experts. On the other hand, you can find a lot of unneccessary information about mathematic, philosopher, ""love story"" in this book. For example: to explain the filehandles: ""Unless you are using artificial intelligence to model a solipsistic philosopher, your program needs some way to communicate with outside world""; to explain operators ""..and as we know in studying math in school, mathematicians love strange symbols. What's worse, computer scientist have come up with their own version of these strange symbol... You could find hundreds of sentences like these in the book but you could not find a good example to tell you how to write a package, object class, etc. It' not worth the money."
2,Not for beginners,"This book is not for Perl Begginers, i found it hard to follow, it is not intended for self learning."
4,"Good, not great, Perl reference","Hey, it's an O'Reilly and Associates book, so you know it has to be good. Nevertheless, I am not so impressed this 2nd edition compared to the 1st edition of this book. The 1st edition has more code examples (highly instructive) and has a much better layout.If you can get your hands on the 1st edition (covers Perl 4, not Perl 5, but almost all of Perl 4 code works fine with Perl 5) of this book, I recommend reading that one instead. The 1st edition is definitely a ""10""."
4,Like eating coffee grounds,This is an extremely condensed book. There are too many footnotes and the humor is obnoxious and frequently gets in the way of learning. However it is an excellent reference although it would be a terrible book for somebody that doesn't know C and Unix well.Do not buy this book if you aren't already familiar with other programming languages.
3,"Starters should look for something else, and ...","I have both v.4 and v.5 of this Camel book, and have been using it from time to time. I know it's written by the creator of Perl. Yet I feel like saying the following: It looks to me that this book has tried to be an introduction to and reference of Perl at the same time, yet somehow IMNSHO it is not particularly successful in either ways. I do thank Mr.Wall for creating Perl, though."
3,Reference but NOT the bok to discover PERL,"One of my friend give me this book because I need to make small scripts in PERL. I was absolutely not familiar with PERL and I have sometimes lots of difficulties to understand the examples given. They are not well commented. I often wonder ""What is the meaning of this ... hum"" You can buy this book if you want a reference, you shouldn't if you are searching something to begin. I am here to order something another book... and will upadte this comment later"
2,Monetary revolutionary or nutball?,"He makes some interesting points. And then repeats them over and over and over. He also gives no suggestion for implementing his solution, other than everyone with a loan suing the bank for loaning them illegitimate money. I believe he is currently incarcerated in a federal prison for tax fraud (claimed Texas was not really a state and therefore didn't have to file tax returns)."
5,Crazy for Cannell,"Dorothy Cannell is witty and fun. Her leading lady is a hit. I love reading Cannell's books--they're a fun ride of English murder and mystery. I literally laugh out loud. If your're looking for a lighthearted mystery to spend your time on, it would be worthwhile investing in this series. Start at the beginning though to get the best taste for the storyline. I wait with bated breath for the next one to come out!"
4,Planet of the Apes DVD collection,Purchased as a gift for someone special who is a fan of these films. I am sure the preson will be delighted to receive them.
5,Like it was filmed yesterday . . .,"Well worth every penny, this quality digital copy looks as though it was filmed just yesterday, hard to believe its from 1968 . The sound is crisp & true, overrall its a genuine quality package of a timeless Sci-Fi (and political) thriller performed by veteran seasoned actors with visionary cinematography . A MUST HAVE for any serious collection . A boxed set this good doesn't come down the Pike often ."
2,Planet of the Apes Legacy Collection,Why even bother???? A collection of the first series of The Apes and have it go out full screen instead of wide screen. Blu-Ray at that. I would not even waste my money.Planet of the Apes: The Legacy Collection (Planet of the Apes / Beneath the / Escape from the / Conquest of the / Battle for the)07/07/2012 ...update....I have been informed that this is Widescreen.
5,Amazing,"this is one of the best sagas of the 60, 70. I was really hoping to have a lot of time on bluray collection is something to take home"
2,LowQualityApeBoxSet,In the past two years I have never seen a special rerelease DVD have so little done to it. The sound as mentioned by others is terrible. The DVD's also are not enhanced for Widescreen TV's so when watching one of these on my widescreen everything is stretched. Since 1999 this is the 1st DVD that I have bought that was NOT enhanced for widescreen tv's. The other was Scarface. It's a shame they couldn't have spent a little more time on the audio. I have purchased Ben Hur and Lawrence of Arabia and they did so much more with the sound and video on those DVD's. If you have a nice home theatre system this is not a DVD set to purchase.
4,"If You're an Apes Fan, This Is for You!","The Planet of the Apes movies, while not rising to the level of greatness, are still really good fun and have a political message that withstands the test of time. This box set includes all five original Apes movies, plus a wonderful documentary on the making of these movies. If you enjoyed the Apes movies when they came out, you'll want to own this DVD box set."
3,Good to see again,"If you like the orginals, this is a great value. For me, it's something to show the grandkids that I know won't scare them"
5,Heston Version Started It All,"It's hard to compare the old version of this classic series to the newer versions that are stunning audiences everywhere - there is no comparison between the special effects and progress that Hollywood has made in the interim. If you are a classic movie fan, this collection is worth its place on the shelf."
4,All of them in one place,"The movies are good, but the features are so-so. The accompanying book has some interesting parts, but overall I could live without it."
1,Won't play on sony bdp-s370,"This is not about the movies. Planet of the Apes is awesome. This is about Sony and whomever made these disks. These will not play in a sony bdp-s370 so don't bother. In addition, Sony support is worthless. I spent over an hour online with them trying everthing from inserting an 'empty' usb flash drive to resetting the player. None of it worked of course. Now I'm told I have to call back on the phone and do it all again with someone else. It's the frikking firmwear you rubes.After several calls to Sony support - and several hours repeating the same steps over and over, they finally agreed that the bdp-s370 does indeed have a problem. Here it is over a month later, and still no firmware update. I'm wondering if Blu Ray can actually survive with this kind of crap. If the people that invented it can't even get it to work, then blu ray might as well be dead."
5,you must buy at this price!,this will b short n sweet! you know the movies are great! the bonus features excellent and the documentary is a classic in itself! but right now this bluray box set is 22.99 on sale!! there is no time to 'think about it' this is a must have and a must buy at this price which of course is cheaper than buying many single disc dvds! what a great buy at a great price! i bought mine when it was 24.99 and thought that was an excellent price and now to see it a few dollars cheaper is excellent!
4,Ape Madness,This is a great set. A great use of bluray on some classic movies. There are some great additions to the set as well with the booklet and the extra features which outline the history of the movies. I never knew the story behind making Planet of the Apes like I do now.One negative is that there is no real case for the disks. They some on a flimsy cardboard sheet that is almost impossible to use to hold the disks. If you get this I recommend you also buy a couple of extra CD cases to hold the disks after you watch them.
4,PLANET OF THE APES: 5 FILM COLLECTION {BLU-RAY},"I hadn't seen these movies in over 30 years. They still hold up pretty good too. The Blu-Ray quality is really good on the 1st movie & a little less on the other {4}. Not bad though. The sound seemed pretty good, although I listen with external speakers hooked up to a regular old stereo system. Lots of special features on disc -1 & not so many on the other discs,but enough to keep you up to date. They are all done in the 2:35:1 aspect ratio which means you get to see all or most of the movie as the director intended. Overall they were enjoyable to watch again in really nice quality."
4,The collection worth owning,"Okay, this is the ultamite collection of ape fans. The special edition with original trailors was a great touch. The only reason I gave it a 4 was that the sequals were great, but weren't as good.Planet of the apes:10Beneath the Planet of the apes:9Escape from the planet of the apes:8Conquest for the planet of the apes:9Battle for the planet of the apes:8The first was the best (of course). I liked the plots for each one. Conquest really showed the violent part of Cesar. Conquest shows the legend of cesar and the battle of the humans. The old one is way better than the new Planet of the apes with Mark Walberg. So, this is worth every cent."
3,Missing scenes in 'Battle' are unforgivable...,"A brilliant series that is captured perfectly on DVD.However, there is one flaw: there are two scenes that appeared in the original 'director's cut' of Battle for the Planet of the Apes that were left off the DVD:1. before the mutants leave to attack ape city, Governor Kolp shows Mendez and Alma the doomsday bomb, and instructs them to launch it at Ape City if he should not return.2. at the end of the film, Mendez and Alma decide to not launch the bomb. instead, they worship it - with Mendez as the leader.These two scenes nicely round out the entire series, but were only shown in the TV version. Why Fox didn't include them in the film, or at least as special features, is beyond me.It's unforgivable. That's why the series is only getting 3 stars."
4,Great Set way worth the $$$ for any fan,"even though the first is the best there all good to see the ""behind the planet of the apes"" is a GREAT documentery"
3,Good set...With flaws.,"I am slightly peeved at the fact that only the first film got the 5.1 treatment. They all look good, but sound is an important thing. This is not the first time this has been done. Warner Bros. did the same thing with the Superman collection.(The first is fantastic, loaded with features and a very good commentary track)......... I would have loved to see a commentary track on POTA. But there's nothing. The bonus disc is a shorter version of the two disc set that is available. There should have been much more. Fox must do better than this, for the sake of their costumers.Still fun to watch, just dissapointing.A.P.L"
4,An excellent collection,"Very good restored sound and video track. A lot of extras, including behind scenes, editors comments, notes and indications! I highly recommend this set!"
5,Can't Beat it,SiFi classic and now on blue-ray! The case is sturdy with invidual cases per blue-ray! The picture is super clear!
4,unhappy,"The DVD's are great , but don't ever try to get a Amazon billing error credited to your bank account or you are in for a real hassle including canceling you credit card just to get the problem resolved.....(Amazon...take a look at this is a big time problem..more to come on this..its not over)....never again...BK"
4,Great movies,"I've been a fan of this series for some years. I got this set for X-mas. Any fan should pick this set up. The clarity in picture qulity,especialy the first film, is breath taking. My only gripe is that only the original film was given the 5.1 treatment. Three Pro-Logic and one,Escape, Closed Captioned. If sound is of no concern to you I say go for this set or wait until all the movies are given the full sound treatment. Also one last note the Behind the Planet of the Apes bonus disk is a nice treat."
3,Needed blu-ray cases,My biggest pev is the fact that these disc' don't come in their own cases. They attach to the box in an odd way that will wear out & then there will be no way to store them properly. Also you have to fold open the whole case just to acess the disc. Its a very poor design. Having a small storage footprint is a big deal to me. This case takes up a lot of room.
5,Apes Rule!,"Finally, a complete set of apes movies that is well worth the price! Yes, all five films are in anamorphic widescreen and sound great on my surround speaker system. The picture quality is excellent and the bonus disc with the documentaries on the making of the films with reminiscences from the stars are interesting and informative, so that I can easily forgive the lack of extras on the individual films themselves. The commentary on Planet of the Apes is less than excellent, but has its moments.While the first two films are the best, the remaining three are all immensely entertaining, even the much maligned final entry, Battle. 4 1/2 stars out of 5."
4,"Sci-fi, overt political commentary, and lots of bananas.",Classic series. A must have for any Apes fan. Makes for a wonderful rainy day Ape-a-thon. Order in lots of bananas and enjoy.
4,Planet of the Apes Collection,"The first Planet of the Apes is the second best science fiction movie ever made, only behind ET. If you loved the first one like I did, then the other four should be worth while seeing. They are all very good, though none quite as good as the original. These movies are intellectual with great story lines and they have very good action and acting."
3,Saga,"This is a great movie series. The problem is that it tends to drag after the third movie. However, all, and all I do like this. It's very different from the book but good non the less. I recommend it to any one who has ever wondered what would happened if another creature ruled earth."
2,TERRIBLE Audio Mixing,"I would think a big Hollywood Studio like Fox would have done a better job with the DVD transfer. The Audio mixing is terrible. The score and sound effects are too loud and the dialogue is barely audible. The volume must be continually adjusted thru-out the viewing. Beware buyers, wait until a better transfer is released."
3,DIDN TLIKE IT,"I had seen this movie since i was younger,and a hoped to see something like that whar i watched on tv ,or something like that on the movies."
4,One of the Best Film Series,"I got this at a great price, the packaging is very cool, and it includes all of the movies, documentaries, and other extras that my old ""Evolution"" DVD boxed set had, plus it looks even better on BD."
4,Hmmm,"I didn't remember that these films were so void of good acting. Still, I enjoyed them mostly. If you are a film collector, then you must have these flicks."
5,"Oh No, It's Those Damn Dirty Apes, All In One Box","Pass out the bananas and get ready to have your shots, to protect you from this onslaught of monkeydom. Great box set to watch on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.Planet Of The Apes is the greatest sci-fi film of all time in my book but as for the sequels, it's a case of hit and miss. I think Planet and Beneath pretty much tell the whole story, the others sadly play out like made for tv movies.The added doco disc is great."
5,Planet of the apes,The item arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. I really enjoyed watching the old movies. While the special effects are not what they are today the movie was very well done for it's time.
1,Bitterly sorry I bought this,"I bought this set on a lark, having loved all of these movies as a 10 yr. old kid. Watching them as a 47 yr. old, I now realize that only the original 'Planet of the Apes' deserves an A+ and remains a sci-fi classic.I grade the 2nd-5th titles in this series as follows:2nd: C-3rd: D (But with a brilliant, haunting ending. Unfortunately it was not filmed particularly well.)4th: D+5th: DThe production budgets of these films decreased over time, from $16 million for the original, to way less than $2 million for the last one (see Wikipedia for more specifics) and boy does it show. The scripts for 2-5 make little sense and often contradict each other. If I had it to do over again, I would purchase only the original."
4,five buck a film!!!,"Without a doubt this is fantastic deal. I really look forward each week to amazing Amaazon's Weekly deal. Rocky films, m..Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia SeriesMission Impossible....etc....They surely award their good customers. keep it going Mr. B..Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series"
1,Techincal issues?,Is anyone else experiencing technical problems wit this set? I can't get but one of the movies to track past the menu screen to the features. I have a first generation SONY blu-ray machine without the ability to upload new firmware...
2,Planet of the Apes Legacy Boxset,"I have one complaint about the PotA Legacy Boxset, but it is a significant one. Evidently there is some copyright protecting software on the disc for the original movie only that prevents me from being able to play it on my computer, where I watch most of my DVD's (the discs for the other movies were fine). It'll play on the DVD player connected to my TV, but to play it on my computer it appears that the only codec that will allow me to play it costs $20 or so. I haven't been able to find a free codec that'll allow me to play it. So I am much less than satisfied with the product."
1,Fox needs to think again,"When I tried to load the disks they say ""your player firmware needs updating"". What???? I've not had problems with any other blu-ray disk I've bought. So I updated the firmware to the latest version and now the screen freezes at the opening menu. Fox seriously needs to think again about whatever they have done to protect these disks. My advice is to stay away from this boxed set."
5,The way I remembered -- over 40 years ago!,Great quality on these discs and the bonus features were good to watch for background info.Also let's not forget fantastic acting with Charleton Heston in title role of ground breaker Planet of the Apes!
3,Classic Ape Drama,"You have to own this - sure it is corny, but at the same time lots of fun and has some good advice ""Ape must never kill ape"" etc etc. Packaging is pretty grand, and the kids will like it - it's different, I liked it a lot more than the remake.The Harper Trading System"
3,PLANET OF THE APES:5 FILM COLLECTION.,Yes I have all of these movies on beta. I thought the movies would look great in hi def and they looked Great! The 1st two were good the last 3 thats another story. With the set being so cheep its like getting the last 3 for free anyway. Watch the 1st 2 with friends and the last 3 when nothing else is on tv.
2,won't play in my sony BDP-S270 player?,"The 2 stars is NOT for the movies! I have loved them, always. i jumped on the blu ray set when it was offered at 50% off. My disappointment came when the discs (I only tried the first 2) would only play for about 20 seconds then freeze. They play fine in my son's PS3...? I spent an hr with tech support doing an online chat, but nothing worked. My blu ray is updated, tech support suggested inserting a usb drive formatted in FAT-32 ....which I did, nothing worked. He then suggested I return the set for another. I'm sending them back tomorrow for a replacement, but I'm not very hopeful that they'll play. I don't think there is anything ""wrong"" with the discs.....since they play in the PS3. So hey, I'll at least have the set, and just hook up the PS3 to the big tv if I want to watch them. Does anyone have any idea why they won't play? My player has always played everything...any suggestion would be welcomed. Thank You Amazon for allowing me to return these....J."
4,Correction to an earlier review's running-time assessment...,"...It's 96 minutes long, not 92 minutes, the same as the Japanese laserdisc release. The extended TV cut of the film has at least ten brand new minutes added to its length (including brief scenes, as well as entire subplots)."
3,Planet of the Apes,"A member of my family had this on their wish list, thus the purchase. What more can I share about this product???"
5,Revolutionary Film or Evolutionary Film...your pick,"Planet of the Apes was always a film that reminds me of what is great about film. They take a concept like space and time travel and mix it with a story of anti-war sentiment and they create a series of films that stand the test of time. I loved them as a child and I love them as an adult. Nothing beats how each movie was connnected and in order to fully appreciaate the overall story it is good to see the entire series. To me it was a film ahead of its time, but I am glad that it was so that I could showcase it to more of my friends in order for them to love it as well."
4,Planet of the Apes - The Legacy Collection,"I was never really thrilled about planet of the apes. The first one was very good. The one I liked the best was beneath the planet of the apes because it had the mutant people that lived underground, then the planet was blown up by Charlton Heston and the Dooms day bomb the the Mutants had as their god. The rest of the movies, Battle for the Planet of the Apes, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, and Excape from the Planet of the Apes I really don't recall watch. may have seen them once or twice but not more than that to say I really cared for those movies."
5,"A Must For The ""Apes"" Fan","A wonderful buy! This package includes all 5 feature films plus an extended ""Behind the Planet of the Apes"" disc which is an in depth look at the series hosted by Roddy McDowall."
2,"might work, might not","Some USB ports don't support these units. I have tried several brands of laptops and desktops, and it seems to be about 50-50 as to whether a particular PC will recognize the hard drive. If it doesn't work on your machine, you are stuck with it. IOGear will not provide refunds or exchanges. Their tech support is worse than not having any tech support at all. Twice I have returned units to them, and they can't even return them to the proper address. Don't waste your time with these units, there are better choices."
3,Calculus build-up has always been a problem with ...,"Calculus build-up has always been a problem with my """"tight"""" teeth, and I can see how this toothbrush could help. However, I didn't see any noticeable difference in my teeth within the week of this Test Drive. Purely as a toothbrush, I found the product easy to hold and comfortable, though not much more so than other toothbrushes."
1,"Don't waste your time on this movie, dumb!!",This is one of the most dumb movies I have ever seen. I would give it 0 stars if I could!! Don't waste your time!!
4,"Simple, funny, enjoyable","It is a good entertainment. Simple story and very well acted. The actress and actors delivered. Not the best picture but I loved the way the simplicity can make an enjoyable movie. By the way, I loved the Brazilian's music."
5,DVD came very quickly,The DVD came within a week after I ordered it. I am very happy with the seller!
1,This is not the full version,"I was very disappointed (as was my wife, for whom the movie was a present) to find that this is not the full version. Significant parts have been edited out of even what is shown on cable TV. The package is not marked as such, but this is a real hack job, wrecking a lot of good scenes. Thumbs down on this release, my first major disappointment in dealing with Amazon."
2,Dopey movie with bad ending,"I was disposed to watch this movie, think it was cute, and never watch it again. I was sorely disappointed, though. The movie follows Penelope Cruz, a girl severely stricken with motion sickness. She leaves her cheating (but good looking) husband, and comes to the US, where she ends up hosting her own cooking show.Now, I think fluff films can be fun sometimes, but this one really wasn't good. The movie ends up following her deciding between two men, and eventually trying to get back a sacrifice she made to a goddess of the sea so she would no longer love her husband. In the end, I felt cheated when she went back to her husband who cheated on her, and never really seemed to love her.If you're looking for mindless entertainment, see this. If you want a movie where you can at least agree with the ending, don't see it."
3,Woman on Top,"At the start of the film, I would have given it five stars. It told a story I'd never heard before and it gave background information about ""Isabella."" The movie was funny and had a certain fairy tale nature. There's only one problem with this tale. There's no Prince Charming. I didn't want ""Isabella"" to end up with either of these selfish men. It's really frustrating to watch her work really hard to get over a man only to return to him in the end."
4,Feel Good movie,"I thought the movie was great! It made me feel good watching it. The whole vibe was so soothing and the music was superb. Penelope Cruz did a good job for it being her first english spoken movie. Her husband is hot as hell, and you could tell that they were meant to be from the beginning. It really capitalized on the essence of love. Great chic flick, sends a good message to woman. Despite her decisoin with men, she realized that her husband was her true love in the end. I now want to move to Brazil!!!!"
3,Deliciously edible!,"While it may not be the best movie with a mix of comedy or drama, there is a good enough mix to give you an interest. And after interest, there is nothing better than watching someone cook, and do it so seductively as Penelope Cruz. The Brazilian music is deeply enchanting and lures you into the plot of the movie.The plot is not difficult to understand, basically a love story, a passion for love intermingled with food. A delightful movie if you're in the movie for something not too comedic, not too dramatic - and just in the movie for a popcorn movie."
1,Does not deserve 1 star!,"This disaster does not deserve even 1 star. Horrible acting - especially the husband/boyfriend seem to read their lines from a teleprompter. Screenplay is dumb and boring. The scene were half of the cities male population follows in P. Cruz fotsteps is ridiculous. Half way thru I thought this can't get any worse, guess what - IT DID! An insult to intelligent movie goers. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Maybe eye candy for the guys - Penelope C. is beautiful, an actress she is not. r,"
5,I liked it,"I don't often watch romances, but I thought this was one was impressive. Changes in setting, music, diverse characters, comedy, and quirky flare like magic rituals and a transgender character helped to make this movie stand out to me."
5,A must buy!,"This is excellent bread mix, super easy to make, lovely crust, soft and moist inside, delicious tasting. The mix creates a nice sized loaf, making it a great value if you sign up for the automatic shipping."
5,"""Come As You Are"" album review","The album, ""Come As You Are"" by April Metcalf is wonderful! If you are a christian/country music fan or simply enjoy listening to a soothing and beautiful voice, then this is the album for you! So many of the songs on this album will set your soul on fire with rejoice! April has a wonderful gift that she is sharing! Having been lucky enough to meet April, I discovered that she is a nice, sincere, and simply a real GOOD person with a beautiful smile that matches her wonderful voice! She explained how she had to take a break from her music career to raise her sons and that maybe she will soon be returning to her love of singing very soon. I can't wait to hear her next album and I'll play this one over and over again because you just can't get enough of that great voice! I am so glad that I purchased this CD!"
4,remarkable.,"This is a biography rooted in its time and peopled with those who knew and worked with Helen Keller. She becomes more of a real woman with desires and tribulations other than her physical handicaps. Due to the nature of her handicaps and the private inner life she shared with only a selected few, this book is less than satisfying because the author can only guess at what transpired in some instances. It demonstrates how isolated she actually was. Unfortunately many documents that could have clarified some of these issues were lost. I think that the author did an admirable job under the circumstances, but I found myself wishing that I really knew more. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the author took such pains to put Helen Keller into the context of her time and society. It is sometimes easy to forget just how remarkable a woman she was."
3,Tough for kids,Great toy if you have the strength of an adult. My 6 year old cannot pull the cord hard enough to generate any lift from the propellers. We enjoyed the toy when I was using it but I was hoping to find a launcher my son could use. I like that it launches 2 at a time though. Its a fun toy as long as you have the strength to use it.
3,Patent information repackaged,"Have you ever read a US Patent all the way through? That's what this book consists of -- a group of interesting and ingenious patents. Ie: very text based and very tediously written. For example: ""Shaft A rotates within the proximity of cam B in a concentric manner producing a force C which exposes gate D to a level of thrust.... and so on""While you don't have to be an engineer to read a patent document (but it helps), it's very time consuming to read through them and gain a summary understanding of how the device/mechanism is supposed to work. Patent lawyers write patents to protect the invention and not to make it easy for the average person to understand them.I was hoping that this book was more descriptive with better diagrams than just a collection patents. A better title would've been ""Ingenious Mechanisms - A collection of patents for Designers and Inventors""."
4,"Very comprehensive, detailed set!","These books are very comprehensive. There are lots of multi-component mechanisms described in great detail for mechanically inclined people.The machines depicted are of an historical nature. I don't see this as a shortcoming, however. Mechanisms of the sort found in these volumes were state-of-the-art at one time. There were no electronic sensors and computer controls at the turn of the last century. Everything had to work -- and had to work mechanically. The mechanisms explained in these volumes are a testament to a certain real-world ingenuity that most of us can't comprehend until we read books like these."
3,I expected more,"I expected something truely ingenious that would leave me enlightened after buying and reading this set. They are very interesting, but I'm not so sure that ingenious is the right word, Clever maybe.. Just remember this was copyrighted in 1930, it's old technology now. It is a good basis to build upon, and you might get some ideas you hadn't seen before. I'm glad to have them."
4,Diamond in the Ruff,"How cliche is that heading, you know you like it. Anyway, my boss pops this record in today, and just off the first song and the cover I was very enticed, by the end of the short EP, I was hooked, definately buying it. It's got that great classic bachman-turner overdrive feel, and it'll definately have you singing along in your head. Anyway, if you don't like it you can chew me. (isn't that a great odd vulgar thing to say, you know you like it)"
4,Why are these guys not on every rock radio station?,"I discovered NYC's Diamond Nights because I was familiar with the work of the guitar player/keyboardist Dr. Laakso (formerly of the Wicked Farleys), and I'll be damned if this isn't one of the best rock EPs I've heard in a long time. These guys bring some tight-sounding, football-playing, head-banging party music that evokes all your classic rock faves like Queen, Aerosmith, and the Cars, while still sounding completely original. Do I also hear a touch of some Ozzy creeping into the vocals of ""The Girl's Attractive""? And watch out for the synths on that song, there's something not right about them...somehow subversive, eerie, and downright brilliant. ""Buddies"" has the catchiest sing along ending I could imagine (and music that could have been written by Rush for some long-lost 80s sitcom theme)."
3,Quilted hamper,"Very shiny silver, quilted hamper. It didn't realize from the picture that it was so shiny, and that it was quilted. I have had for a week, and it seems pretty sturdy. It is flat against the back, so can easily sit up next to a wall."
1,Hands stick and clock stops,"Disappointing because hands on the clock face occasionally catch on each other and then the time stops. Second hand keeps sticking on the minute hand and requires a gentle tap for the time to start again. Useless if the time is not accurate. Thought it might be a fluke, but it's happened at least five times now."
5,Quality Boonie Hat,"Received this hat quickly. This is a quality product, not a cheap imitation. I would recommend it to everyone interested in buying a tiger striped boonie hat. You won't be disppointed."
3,"Slow Burn with only a bit of pay off. Nah, just plain BORING!","I love Japanese films. I love a slow burn psychological movie. I love beautiful and poetic. But watching this - I was getting antsy. It looked great, the acting was great, but jeez - you really need some patience to make it through this film and to be honest at the end I didn't really think it was worth the time. It was okay and I expected the slow burn that the director is known for granting to his audience, but this really doesn't need to bein anyone's collection. If you need it, buy it used or rent it."
3,A VERY APT TITLE . . .,"A nicely-designed film, mostly designed to shock. Prompted by Amazon to write this review, I realized that mostly I remember the real naughty/ shock stuff, but the plot? Guess I'll have to go back and re-view this strange circus, what it's about and what happens all evade me. Maybe that's a good thing; like, I can see it again for the first time.(I liked SUICIDE CLUB but really disliked MOON CHILD; this falls in the middle, between salacious and silly and interesting in an odd way, I think. Maybe. I just dunno.)"
5,Come prepared.,"Strange Circus is a great movie. It's very poetic, somewhat slow-paced, and it's beautiful to look at - at least when you're not looking away and covering your eyes. Still, it doesn't matter- there's no place to hide. This movie burrows right into your gut and stays there. It's not a horror film; it's more of a twisting, surreal drama. And yet it contains just about every horrific taboo subject you can think of. Rape, incest, forced voyerism, mutilation, physical and mental abuse- if you can think of it, it's in there. Did I mention the finale also includes a chainsaw? Yes, it's poetry, but it's a brutal poem that hits you in the gut, over and over again. If you're only a casual fan of Asian Cinema, this movie will be like staring into the sun. Don't do it. Don't watch. But if you're familiar with Sono's other works, or Miike's work, this movie is quite a ride. Come prepared."
4,Brand New,This wireless adapter was brand new still in original packaging. Arrived in just a few days and works great.
5,Good.,The network adapter came in the time frame they said without damage. It worked fine and I am very happy with this purchase.
1,3 months and Toast Just like I thought,"I Bought this from a seller on ebay who sent it to me in not the original package. I question him about it, he said no problem that's normal. WRONG!!! Three months my son had this product and it's dead. Most likely the seller pawning it off as new but in reailty a REFURB!! Send back all items not received in original package unless otherwise notified like amazon does!! Now I have to buy him a new one. A real NEW ONE!"
1,xbox 360 wireless network adaptor,"We purchased an xbox 360 wireless network adaptor thru amazon from a private buyer in March 2009. it does not work anymore. it was working one minute and not the next. I cannot find the email and would like to know if you could locate it for me to see if there is any warranty.Thank you,Therese DeBlasio"
2,Horribly Overpriced,"This is a regular wireless A/B/G usb adapter. Although it works well, an adapter like this should not cost more than half of its current price. I understand that Microsoft wants to get back the money they are losing on selling the consoles, but I think the games already make up enough of those losses."
1,Xbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter,"The first adapter was defective. Returned for a second adapter, also defective. Microsoft tech support suggested I try a 3rd adapter because they have known quality problems with this product. Bought a Linksys wireless gaming adapter instead for half the money and it worked right out of the box.(Amazon customer service was quick on the returns (free s&h;) and they refunded my money after the 2nd defective adapter.)"
5,xbox wireless network adapter,i purchased this for my son's. it came when they said and works like they said. sorry i do not have any other info on the product.
1,Works great but...,"It works, but I had to buy a new router that supports it. Not only that but this should have been included with the elite.Vastly over priced, and compatibility was an issue for me."
2,Meh.,I f what you want is portable gaming around any room in your house. I hope you don't wanna play Halo 3. The reason I say that is that Halo 3 is one of the most intense (for your 360 to run and for live to share with the other 360's) It can't handle Halo 3. This makes me very sad. Midnight club works fine Soul Caliber is fine but I can not seem to run halo 3. Download times are also exceedingly slow. COD WaW is also fine from closer distances. But My Cable router is in my basement and with the trip to my room directly above 1 floor up everything is to slow. Though I havn't tried for netflix yet my guess would be not so much. My wireless broadcasts at 2.5 GHz normally so i'm sure if to have fios it would be fine but but the wireless transfer cuts your speed into FOURTHS.
2,Not Necessary at All.,"This adapter is an alternative, albeit more expensive alternative, to the original XBOX adapter. If you feel you must have an accessory with a matching color scheme, that's your call. However, you can save a LOT of money by using the original XBOX adapter.Microsoft Wireless-G Xbox AdapterThe above adapter is fully compatible with the XBOX 360, and much cheaper as well. There is no difference in performance, and is a much better choice.I gave this 2 stars because it does work, but it doesn't deserve the money that people spend on it."
4,"Plug-n-Play, but go w/ N Adapter now","Easy as pie to install and connect. No dropped connections after months of online play, etc. However, spend the extra couple $$ and go w/ the N adapter. D/L content of XBOX Live is mucho faster. NTM, streamimng videos off Netflix, there's a HUGE improvement."
3,"Gets the job done, but doesn't shine.",Very easy setup . The adapter found my network & I just had to typein my security code.Have played some Halo 3 & Grid. Also tried watching Netflix movies.The first time I hooked it up everything was running sweet & fast.I couldn't believe I was getting hd movies streamed from Netflix.The amazement lasted for about 1 or 2 days.Now I continue to have periods of slow down and occasionallyget disconnected from games and Netflix .... even with my laptop sitting nearbygetting a good connection.At first I thought it was netflix but if this was the case I wouldn't have gamelag too.
3,It's ok,"This product is ok. It's not as accurate as it should be. It'll connect for a good while, but while I'm playing with friends online, I get kicked off because the adapter loses connection. I don't understand why the signal goes in and out. My wireless router is just down the hall in the other room. This product would be great if it had a wider range reception, so the connection won't dropp on me everytime I'm playing online with other people."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL XBOX 360 USERS,I was a little nerves buying this product since I have a Mac and I'm running an Airport Extreme. But to my surprise as soon as I plugged it to my 360 and turned it on. It found my network with no problem. It asked for the network password and the rest is history. I'm in xbox live heaven.
5,A little expensive...,"but well worth it. Works as expected and delivers stable connectivity to Xbox Live, can't ask for much else. Intall is as simple as plugging it in, the biggest issue was getting it out of the packaging. If your router isn't near your T.V. this ones a no brainer."
1,"DOES NOT WORK, RECEIVED IT TWICE STILL SAME THING","They sent a product that didn't work, they sent me a replacement which didn't work. They told me they were sending me another one almost 10 days ago and I still have not received it and they are not returning my calls either. worst service ever........they don't do what they said they would do.........I would never trust them again or purchase anything from them again............"
5,Great product!,I was very pleased w/ my purchase. The adapter works great and was very simple to add on to my Xbox.
5,Excellent product!!!,"The wireless adapter is excellent. I hooked it up and within 5 mins, I was on-line. It was so easy to get going with this. I have my xbox 360 in another room, on the same floor as my wireless router and I have no problem with a connection. The wireless adapter connected to my netgear router without any problems. Using this is so much easier than trying to run extra cables to have internet connection!! The wireless adapter is a little pricey but that is no reason, in my opinion, to give it a bad review! I am extremely happy that I bought it!!"
2,"Does what it's supposed to do, poorly","Honestly this is one of the worst pieces of hardware I've ever used. While it does enable your Xbox 360 to connect to a wireless network, it does a terrible job of it. The transmit strength of it is nowhere near what you'd find on a laptop or desktop computer, meaning that while your laptop might get a good signal where your 360 is, the Xbox probably won't get as good a signal. Case in point: I can download movies incredibly quickly on my laptop from my entertainment room, while my 360 often struggles to even connect to the network.Only get this if you have to. If you can, use ethernet instead."
2,Worked great! (For 30 minutes),"The adapter was super easy to set up even with wep and mac filtering in place. Worked great for 30 minutes and then quit. The red light stays on, but the xbox bi longer recognizes it. The settings page for it is grayed out now. Tried resetting everything - no luck sent it back to get a new one - hopefully it was justa fluke. Thanks for the great exchange service Amazon!"
1,slow,Purchased this to work with my linksys router. The Xbox 360 wireless network adapter is slow and it is necessary to have the machine pulled out 2 ft. from the wall in order for it to work. Very disappointed.
4,Works great. Simple plug & play. Too pricey.,"Read plenty of reviews and finally gave in. I have no option for my current residency, had to go WiFi. Works great, but very overpriced. I CAN CONFIRM THAT THIS WORKS WELL WITH NETGEAR!"
2,Eh.....,Length:: 0:53 MinsThis wireless network was okay. I wouldn't recommend it. But I would recommend the wireless network adapter the has the a/b/g&n; networks.
4,Works like it should,I have had no problems with this wireless adapter. My linksys router is 2 rooms away and the xbox 360 sits under a tv stand with my tv on top of it. I have had no problems with it losing signal. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants xbox live without the wires getting in the way.The only knock is the price.
3,Works as it should,I'm very happy with this componant. Delivery was fine though it came with no box or documentation.
2,Non-Secure over Wireless,"Microsoft admits this will not work with WPA2It rarely works with WPA (cannot even see my router's SSID)Anything less than that (WEP or no encryption) is absurdly risky unless there is no other traffic on your router. Do not disable your encryption to play games, kids. It's not worth it.Mom and Dad: if your kid is using this device, they have probably compromised your wireless network security."
2,XBox 360 Wireless Network Adapter,"OK, I'm a computer junkie. Been using them for over 23 years and am currently in the IT Field. The wireless adapter was a BEAR trying to get the XBox 360 to connect to my wireless network. All of my other wireless products were easy to connect, however, this made it look ugly.After about an hour and a half after plugging it into the back of the XBox 360, I FINALLY got it to connect. Now that it's connected it's working fine, however, just be aware that it MAY pose a challenge to some."
2,Doesn't work with a lot of access points.,"I purchased this adapter, because generally bridges are a pain, and figured an ""integrated"" product would work out-of-the-box. Do your research. This will not work with Apple Time Capsule (or Express, from additional research), or numerous other access points for no reason that I can identify.Microsoft held its customers hostage on this one, which I was willing to live with, but the fact that I can't get it to work with either of the two access points I have around is a total mess.These are *standards* that Microsoft is not adhering to. insulting."
5,It just works!,"Easy to install, just clip it to the back of your Xbox 360 and plug it in. No extra power source is needed.Your Xbox 360 will search for the wireless network on it's own, and then you fill in the settings on a one-time setup screen. Really easy!"
3,How do you rate something that doesn't work?,"I've tried two of these now and neither on them worked. I called Microsoft and, after running through a few tests, they had me send it back. I did some research and apparently there are several people that have had the same problem.Amazon was very accommodating in allowing me to exchange one but they would not allow me to exchange the second item but issued a refund instead (per their policy). Unfortunately they also raised their price in that time so I have no tried again.Why did I give it three stars? It is supposed to work very well if you get one that works.BTW I do understand that the Panasonic BL-PA100KTA works very well with the 360, provides a better signal, and, because it's not 360 specific, it would have more applications for the future."
4,value for money,Agreed that it is little costly but rather than hanging out behind the 360 it fits just right in.Also the connectivity is good and haven't had any problem in last 2 months.Good buy!!
4,XBox 360 Wireless Network Adapter,"This took me a little time to figure out how to configure, but that's only because I'm not a very technical person. Someone who knows what they're doing would figure this out in a minute. The XBox 360 is on the bottom floor of our house and the Wireless Router is on the top floor. With the exception that it slows down anyone else trying to get on the internet while an online game is being played, the wireless network adapter for the XBox 360 is really great. My son has no complaints about the game speed or connection speed at all, and I don't have to worry about extra wiring!"
5,Heads up!,This product does not support WPA2. Other than that it is a great adapter that does the job well. I just had to adapt to the fact that it doesn't do WPA2.
5,Wireless adapter,"It arrived very quickly, was easy to install and I haven't had any issues, It works perfectly!"
2,doesn't work,Will not connect to the wireless home network no matter what troubleshooting you do. Called Xbox and my internet provider to get some help and it wouldn't work.
4,Its good for the price I paid...,The adapter is good for the price I paid for it. I think its still retarded that 360 doesnt come with a wifi. For you to potentially spend another 100 bucks more for this thing is a rip off really. M$ got over on folks with that. Hopefully you can find a cheap one like I did.
3,Very easy to use but highly overpriced,"It was a piece of cake to set up. The Xbox 360 even has slots specifically for this adapter. What kills me is the price on these things. I bought my wireless router for [...]and this thing has a [...]MSRP? Come on Micro$oft, give us a break. Amazon helps with discounts and special offers, I bought mine for [...] with [...]credit toward an Amazon Xbox marketplace download. I get that there is a markup on peripherals but its outrageous that they charge THIS MUCH for the technology that's involved."
1,Junk,"First one quit after 6 months, second one quit after three. Should have bought the more expensive wireless adapters..."
3,Good but not good enough!,"I bought this item because i wanted to eliminate the cables in my house, the fewer cables the better, but the item didnt work as much is I'd hoped for. It drops the signal constantly and it doesnt acquire as much signal as it should, Specially being the fact that I have a $200 router that gives good signal to my best friend two blocks away (which tells me is not my computer's router).I'm a gamer which means I play at least 2-3hrs a day... I was really excited about this item but its performance is kinda poor. So if you a gamer like me consider other options before trying this adapter, unless you have no other options. Trust me, it can get pretty annoying specially if you like FPS games and you get killed a lot due to lag on your signal or just loose the game cause it lost the signal.Hope this helps!"
4,Microsoft vs. Other means,"While you can setup a wireless to connect to your x360 in other ways, I give microsoft credit where credit is due. They make things relatively easy and their products work. This is no exception. Simply plugs in and is made for the system which is nice. Very simple to use, very effective."
5,WIRELESS,"THE REASON I LIKE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH IS THAT IT'S WIRELESS,OF COURSE.MY SON CAN PLAY HIS GAMES WITHOUT THE WORRY OF ANYONE TRIPPING OVER HIS CORDS. THAT WAS MY MAIN REASON FOR PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT. THIS ADAPTER CONVERTS HIS XBOX 360 AND MAKES ALL THE CABLE WIRES DISSAPEAR. WE JUST LOVE THIS PRODUCT."
4,"Overpriced, but very quick and easy to set-up. Works great.","Amazon provides this item at the best price (from a reputable online store) I found online. Still, Microsoft should be embarassed at the overpricing of this item. The price makes it instantly loose a star.In my experience with computers things rarely go without a hitch when adding software or hardware. This is a welcome departure. It took seconds to hook up and minutes to run the auto-test and be up and running on Xbox Live - awesome.For those running a wireless network at home, I would highly recommend this item. I run it from my basement to my wireless router upstairs and have 3 out of 4 bars signal strength. It is compatable with most routers, but double check at the [....] site for that listing before purchasing to be safe."
5,Awesome,This device is amazing! I plugged it in and within seconds I was connected. It says that I have low signal strength but I tried playing on xbox live and I had no lag at all! ( my room is on the complete other side of the house with many walls in between )This product is definitely worth the money.
4,Nice,I waited a while to get it a little cheaper and it works really well. I don't have neighbors close so don't use a secure wireless setup. So when i plugged it in it worked right out of the box. I did look at the setup for a secure setup and that looks ultra simple.Very Happy!!!
4,Only giving 4 stars because of high price,"I think this is a great, yet expensive product. I hated having to pull out my modem, hook up a cord to the xbox going all the way across my room making my xbox have to sit on carpet which isnt good for ventilation and it would often heat up easier.So now instead of having to worry about hooking up/ putting everything back I can just turn on my xbox and DING, connected to XBL.Not all of us are lucky enough to have an modem really close to our consoles, and for those of us who have to have cords going from room to room, or as the review below from floor to floor, this is a must have. There are cheaper alternatives, but I figured why not go with the product it was intended for."
4,No more trailing wires,If you are looking to declutter all you cables behind your XBOX 360 this will fit the bill nicely. Set-up took just five minutes because I am on a secure network and it takes that long to just insert your WEP key but it is nice and straight forward. The bandwidth itsn't quite the same as running a cable but I live in an old house and it would taken considerable effort to make a clean installation. It is a little pricey and I am sure Microsoft could reduce the price by $10 to $15 with eroding their margins too much but honestly it was worth it to me just to eliminate the cabling.
1,Product received was non-functional,"The adapter we received was inoperative. I called Microsoft and received a prompt replacement after sending it to them (Microsoft) While not Amazon's fault, it did require a lengthy phone conversation with Microsoft (mostly waiting on hold) to get a replacement. Apparently, there have been quite a few of these that did not work."
1,Garbage!!,"I am not sure that I have ever given an item 1 star, but I won't forget this one anytime soon. Truthfully, I would have expected to pay about $20 for the item if it didn't have the Xbox branding on it (and if it worked). The range is absolutely abissmal. I have several wireless devices that have no problem getting an excellent signal in different areas of my house but this thing would not budge from a weak signal no matter how much I played with the direction of the antenna. I would highly suggest that you consider a powerline adapter as an alternative to this. You'll get a lot more for your money."
3,"Overpriced, but it works.","Yes, it's overpriced, but it does what it needs to do. To clarify a previous review, the Xbox 360 has three USB ports - one on the back and two on the front. This adapter sits on the back of the console, plugged into a USB port."
3,useful but weak,"its great to be able to connect my 360 up wirelessly, but the signal for it is so weak. they even say in the set-up instructions to make sure there is nothing in between the addaptor and the router."
2,Current problem with Quality Control on these,"I have heard nothing but good things on these (except for price) but buyer beware right now (~June 2008). I am sending back the second one that is defective, and I have read on numerous message boards that there is currently bad batches of these things being shipped out from microsoft.Obviously not Amazon's fault (they are great about sending replacements - hopefully the third will work!), and it will hopefully be rectified soon."
3,Worked Great,"This adapter was easy to install..and works very nicely. Just keep in mind..that to use this product..you DO need to have already some sort of wireless hub, or router on your PC tower. But it works great. Thanks"
4,"Great Functionality, Painful Pricetag","In a nutshell, this adapter simply works. If you've never set up a wireless network before, you will probably STILL have it up and running pretty quickly. If you know your way around the hardware, it's virtually plug and play.Let's face it though, this is one pricey little gadget and you'll save money by running CAT5 cable to your router. For my family, not having to deal with running cables throughout the entertainment areas is well worth it."
4,"Expensive, but saves on the hassle","After having nothing but problems with a cheaper Netgear product, we got this one and it's perfect. Simply plugged it in and it worked. Not a single problem. No annoying set up or stressing over compatibility. It's also small and practically invisible behind the console.I only give it four stars because of the price. I think it's a rip off. But that's the way the industry is, and it does work very well."
1,there is an AFTERMARKET product for 50 dollars less!,"Belkin brand wireless G gaming adapter! I went to walmart to get the Xbox brand wireless adapter and they were sold out. I was about to go to Best buy and saw this on the shelf. Its in a red and silver/grey box and works for the 360, Wii, PS2 and PS3! hooks right up to the USB ports and I was online and wireless 5 minutes after getting home. Its bigger than the Xbox brand, but you save $50, which is almost a new game. I haven't had any problems and its compatible with tons of wireless routers."
1,Not worth the money,"Yes, it works. Yes, it's easy to install. But the reality is that Microsoft is charging far too much for the functionality. It works so seamlessly because the hardware itself was already designed for WiFi. You're essentially spending $100 for an antenna--which is inexcusable considering WiFi PC cards cost $20. Even the Nintendo DS comes with WiFi, and that's $129 for the whole game system.In short, this is never worth buying new. If you just have to buy this thing new, get it from online auctions, where it usually costs $60. Otherwise steer clear from this transparent example of Microsoft greed."
3,Slow and drops connection A LOT,When it works its ok although this rarely happens. Get ready to lag spikes and get dropped during games like crazy. Even with high speed and dual band router it still sucks. Relocate your xbox at all costs. Can't beat hardwire and for this price you can get enough 1gig cord to reach to the moon and back. I'm glad I got this for free from a friend.
3,Decent but not great,"Yes this will ""officialy"" work with your xbox and it does a decent job. However there are better and more reasonably priced ones such as the linksys wireless n gaming adapter which is a little bit more but works better and will have a faster download speed so i would recommend that one over this item."
3,works as advertised but overpriced,"this is by far the simplest way to add wireless network capability to your 360, but... its also one of the most expensive. MS loves gouging xbox customers with high priced peripherals and complex payment schemes(MS points)."
3,Just stops working.,"So I bought this around November of last year. It was working in my living room for about three months, then it just started getting laggy. My laptop connection was fine, but the xbox connection was constantly going from 3 to 4 bars(out of 5). Then I moved it up to my room,, which is farther from my router than the living room, and it worked perfect, until now that is. I was playing halo, then I just started lagging terribly. When I play COD4, people stop and go. When I look at the network settings, it ranges from 4 to 5 bar connection, but that is not the actual result. Might as well be 1 to 2 bars. I suggest finding an alternative."
5,A must have !!!,"Totally worth the $$, my router sits upstairs and my xbox is downstairs, I haven't been kicked off yet !!! Don't hesitate like i did for so long, just get it and save yourself the hassle !!"
4,XBOX 360 Wireless,This item is fairly easy to set up. Biggest issue is if you run an extremely tight (high security) then you have a bit of work to do to set up the unit.Works great since put on my Xbox.
4,It Works and it should for how much it cost,"I had to buy this item due to the fact that I had no other real way of getting my Xbox 360 connected. The upside of this product is it connects from my upstairs Linksys connection, that is also on the other side of the house. So the product itself works very well. However, it does cost way to much money for something that is included with all other next-gen systems and handhelds. I give it four stars because it works great, but it cost way to much for what it does."
4,It is what it is,"It does what it says it does. It works well. It is way over priced, but it's a must have if you can't have your xbox wired."
4,Expensive / Simple Solution,"This is the easiest way to get the 360 on your home wireless network. It's too expensive, and Microsoft should lower the price / imbed this device in the Xbox 360. I think it was short sighted on their part, as the online function is great, and Microsoft can make money off of the service and software you download. Regardless, as your time has value, this device makes the most sense out of all the 360 wireless networking options."
5,Takes some Configuring,"Well I am not entirely Tech savy, but I'm not the worst either....anyway, I brought this for my boyfriend and at first it couldnt pick up my wireless signal, but after some configuration ( sorry I couldnt expalin what he did... it involved using a code to recognize our network or something) it worked just fine! and He loves it. Now the Internet line is in the livingroom and the Xbox is on the flat panel in the bedroom.Worth it if your into the whole Video game craze."
5,Pricey but it works well.,I got this for my son. It was pretty easy to set up and it works well. Why does it cost twice the price of a wireless router though?
3,An Annoying Necessity,"The Xbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter is a well made accessory. It generally works very well at picking up a signal from a wireless airport. However, this item is very overpriced. I do not wish to seem like a fan of Sony, because I have had my Xbox 360 for several years now and believe that it is currently the best console of this generation, but making one pay $85 for what Sony gives installed in the PS3 is ridiculous. Let alone the $50 per year to have Xbox Live, this is just Microsoft trying to get more of your money. Luckily, I got this item for a friend for a mere $10. If money is no object however, I would recommend this product as it does work how it intended to."
4,Excelente device,"This device is excelent, simple and easy to install. The point that can give some trouble is the MAC ID: the ID written on the device is different from the one identified by the router."
2,"If you have an Apple wireless network, don't waste your time.","I bought this unit before I found out that it's not compatible with Apple's Time Capsule (which I have). It won't work with that device unless you ramp it down to 80211b speed ONLY. Some folks have had luck getting to work with the regular Airport routers, so YMMV if you have one of those. I did have it up and running until I tried a different game router; when I plugged this unit back in it would no longer recognize my wireless network at all! Add to that the annoyance of trying to configure it and a clunky Xbox interface (it WON'T network passwords for example) and you have a bit of a disaster. I can't vouch for it's performance on a PC network, but if you have an Apple network take my advice: hard wire your 360 directly to a router, or an Airport Express. Same cost, WAY less hassle."
3,seems expensive but maybe worth it to some,"I don't own this since I have my 360 wired via a switch, but I would say it is too expensive for what it is. I'm sure it works well, but again, I just can't see paying this much for it. If you are technically adept I suggest some other wired/wireless options in order to spend less."
2,expensive add on,"there are a bunch of things the 360 lacks and built in wireless internet is one of them. you have to add on 100 for wireless internet. it works well when you get it set up, but adding on things to get the 360 adds up.the hd dvd player and the wireless internet add up to 700 bucks. thats 100 over the ps3.overall if you have wireless internet, this is a requirement for online gaming and its another way microsoft robs you of your cash."
3,another 33% for wifi?,"guys we have to take a stand and just do without!! if we do the price has to drop. Its just highway robbery to charge 33% of the console price for somthing that should have been uncluded.c'mon 60 bucs per (half decent) game. additional 50 bucs for a controller. and then this microsoft point rip off for gamer pictures, lame themes and games from atari 2600. other then the controller those things should be included in your live subscription. Ps3 i welcome u with open arms. please dont disappoint me. oh! anyone in the market for an xbox 360? lol"
4,For those that like things clean,I used to have the CAT-5 cable running across the floor so I went ahead and bought this to help clean up.Integrates cleanly and easily with the 360. Not worth it unless you really just can't stand cables running everywhere.
1,Far Too Expensive!!,"Works OK but is too damn expensive. Let's face it, this piece of Chinese made plastic would probably cost a few dollars to make and most similar products supply these built in, so this should be a very cheap add on. It's not, it is extremely expensive, and a price gouge from MS !"
4,Has difficulty with walls,"The 360 wireless adapter was fine except when I wanted to watch Netflix in HD. Unfortunately the adapter did not get strong enough of a signal to permit this so I have 200 feet of ethernet running through the house. That being said, it is expensive but worth it if your wireless router is close to your system and there are not 3+ walls between it."
3,XBOX 360 Wireless Adapter,"First one arrived defective. Microsoft has the worst customer service ever! I called them several times to get it fixed, so finally I returned item back to Amazon. The second adapter is OK so far. Thank you, Amazon, will shop again."
4,Great for everything except Media Center HD Videos,"In a nutshell, this adapter is simple, elegant, and functional. It's perfect for connecting with XBOX Live, and works for all Media Center Extender needs except HD video (insufficient bandwidth). If you're a gamer, and not a Media Center junkie, this is for you (unless an Ethernet cable is a viable option, in which case you don't need this adapter). If you use your XBOX 360 as a Media Center Extender, you'll probabably want to stick with an Ethernet cable (minimum 100 mbps) unless you have zero interest in HD."
1,If i could give 0 I would,I have had a wireless network adaptor(plenty actually) and none have given me as many problems as this one. every five minutes it drops the signal to my router(which every other adaptor picked up fine) so I cant even get a single match or game in before getting dropped or booted. ITS TERRIBLE!
1,worth it only if one can get it to work,"I'm also connectivity issues, cant get the adapted to pick up my wireless signal at home. Is expensive and pain for me.... I'm pretty sure it would have been a great product only if it had worked tot me"
3,Works fine,I bought for my kids is good but it tends to lose connection I have gotten a bit frustrate but it does the job it just might be my inter provider
5,"It's not a game, but it helps with them.","It's been working great since I got it. It only once got a little finiky, but after disconnecting it and reattaching it started working again just fine. It works a lot better than the original Xbox wireless. It seems to pick up a pretty good signal and the fact thay you can change the angle helps."
4,Awesome product!,"This little baby is great. It snaps right on to the back of the xbox 360 and is super easy to set up on your network. The only reason I didn't give it 5 out of 5 stars is because 1) it's too expensive and 2) it should be a built in feature on the console instead of a separate $100. When you keep adding in all these little extras like the adapter and the HD-DVD player, the XBOX 360 isn't looking like such a good deal over the PS3 anymore."
5,"Easy setup, work as expected, no problems","The setup is easy, I've used this for several months and have no problems gaming and seeing moviesw with netflix,"
5,Xbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter,"Awesome Product! My Router is on the second floor of my house and my 360 is in the basement, and I still get great connection!"
5,XBOX 360 Wireless Connected,"This was the easiest item to install. It was a gift for my son. He plugged it in, found the wireless router in the house and away we went. He was connected to the internet wirelessly in a matter of minutes. And he's been playing with old friends and new friends all over the world!"
4,Might just be worth the expense,"I recently joined the Xbox Live world and after having to move my modem back and forth from my console to my PC, I decided I needed to go wireless. I didn't want to pay the high price for the official Xbox 360 adapter, so I first tried a Linksys one. After a few hours with tech support from Xbox, Linksys, and my router manufacturer, I was still unable to get the Linksys wireless adapter to work. After reading other reviews on the 360 adapter, I caved in and bought one. I plugged the unit into the back of my 360 and after one quick call to Xbox technical support regarding an IP address, I was online. Yes, this item is expensive, but it is sleek and easy to use, and just might be worth the cost."
1,Buyer Beware,"If you have Verizon FIOS with an Actiontec MI424WR router, it probably won't work, my didn't. There are hundreds of simmlar experiences on-line. I should have done a Google search prior to buying. Forget about calling Verizon,X-Box or Actiontec support-They ultimately will tell you its not their fault,call the other guy."
2,Here's the deal,"This is an excellent Wireless adapter for Xbox live gameplay, works flawlessly. The big problem is, it should be with the Xbox 360 when you buy it, not having to pay 100 dollars later on to get it to play Xbox live. The Microsoft rapeage is getting a little rediculous."
1,can't get it to work with an iMac as wireless hub,"despite what others may have written here, I can't get this device to work with my airport network. I'm not using a stand-alone airport hub, but rather have my iMac (intel) set up as the wireless hub. I've scoured the internet for information, hoping for a solution, but I've read elsewhere that people can't get it to work with WEP security, and that the XBOX doesn't play nice with Apple's standards-based DHCP server built into OS X. For the time-being, I've given up on the whole thing :-("
3,not to bad,"the price is the worst thing, second, is i cant pick up more than 3 bubbles with this thing along with everysingle friend on my xbox friends list, when i plug right in to my modem directly, i get 5 stars, so for 100 bucks for a 3 star hookup, it could do much better. i have 2 friends that couldnt even use it because of locations, its a hit and miss thing. amazingly it only droped me once during gameplay and it did count on the counter for a bad play, that sucked..."
1,It required more than you think,I ordered this for my husband for Christmas. What I didn't know was that you have to have a certain type of router to work with this adapter. You have to get a really expensive one that wont drop your games in the middle of playing...I returned mine and just bought the cord to hook into the modem. Not worth it
3,Very helpful device,"This is a great buy for people who want to get on Xbox Live but don't want to have another wire in their entertainment center. I got the Wireless Network Adapter very fast, in perfect condition, and it's worked flawlessly."
2,"Expensive, and NOT worth it","Picture this - I have an XBox 360. In the same vicinity I also have a DVR, PS2 and an ethernet-enabled DVD player. My access point is upstairs. I'd like to connect the 360 via Wi-Fi but wouldn't it be great to connect all this other stuff and not pay 80 bucks for ONE adapter.Get this instead -NETGEAR WGPS606 54 Mbps Wireless Print Server with 4-port SwitchI have one, and connected all four of the aforementioned network appliances INCLUDING the 360 to my access point upstairs for the same price as the ONE XBox adapter. The product is Netgear's print server with a 4-port switch. It effectively bridges your network from your access point to an extension in the basement.I've been using it for over a year and love it - don't let MS rip you off with more proprietary equipment. We've all got more than just the XBox to connect these days, so why not make it easier on yourself?"
5,Fantastic...,"This product is great! I used to have a very long ethernet cable cable running about 40 feet from my computer to my xbox. It was a real eyesore! I always wanted a wireless adapter for my xbox, but really didn't want to pay the $100 pricetag. Anyway, I am very glad I did. It is worth every penny."
5,Quick and Easy,"This is a great option for people who don't want to have ethernet cables running all over their house. If you have a good wireless signal than you shouldn't have any problems with this. It is a bit pricey so you have to ask yourself how badly you want to have access to Xbox live, but as far as the adapter, it works great!!!"
3,NAT rating,not the fault of the shipper - the shipper had excellent speed. but the product itself - I can't join with friends or chat while on Xbox Live because my NAT setting is closed. I've done everything I can with my Router settings and even used this Wireless product at a friend's house with the same result. Any help would be appreciated.
5,Big hit as a Christmas present.,This was a Christmas present for my eldest son.He was very happy with it.Arrived quickly and were well packaged.I think this was an excellent value.
2,Defective- Be careful,"I'll admit it works beautifully and easily-- when it works, that is.Before you purchase this, do an online search in google or something and check out the problems people have with this.After one year of buying this, it stopped working. It simply stopped working. I looked online to see if maybe there is a way to fix this. I was amazed at how many people also had the same problem as me. For such a price, one would expect this adapter to last a little bit longer than one year.An alternative to this adapter is to buy an easy access point and an ethernet cable. That should cost less than half the price of this adapter.Some people are lucky I guess, but I was not. Do some research first, though."
4,works pretty good,"It works well, it downloads fast, and I haven't encountered any lag so far.While it hasn't ever disconnected from xbox live while I'm using the controller or in an online or offline game, it does tend to disconnect from xbox live after 10-15 minutes if I set the controller down and don't touch it for 10-15 minutes.One thing I noticed, while it doesn't affect the adaptor's speed or effectiveness any, is that adaptor uses a lot of bandwidth when it's downloading. It tends to slow the internet down on my desktop computer when the adaptor is downloading."
2,Constantly Disappears From The xbox,"This thing cost way to much for it's lack or reliability. At [...]+ you'd think you'd get a product that just worked, and it does, for a little while at a time. Randomly this thing keeps disconnecting and when you go to reconnect it doesn't know you have a wireless adapter plugged in. If you look at the adapter it's self you'll see that the light is off, indicating that it's not plugged in. (It's red when it's not connected, green when it is, and no light when it's not plugged in). Simply unplugging it and plugging it back in seems to do the trick, but theres no telling for how long.If you can, run ethernet to your xbox. If you can't you shouldn't buy this with high expectations."
4,"Works great, too expensive","This adapter is very easy to use and has worked flawlessly since I've had it. Going through a wireless connection does introduce some gaming lag once in a while due to a bad connection, but other than that it is the same as directly hooking into the router.I have used this with at least 4 different routers, all with encryption and had no problems with connecting.It is insulting, however, that they make you pay this much for a simple wireless adapter. A similar product for a PC would cost about $30. This thing sells for triple that."
4,Drop the price!,"The thing deserves a four star rating because it works, and that's the important thing. However Microsoft seems to like taking customers money, and they're taking as much as they possibly can. The thing was $99!I had a little trouble setting it up, I had to go into Network Settings, and mess around a little bit before the thing was set up, but it wasn't to bad. Creating a profile on XBOX LIVE takes an additional half-an-hour, but your worries are quickly erased once you start playing some other people online.Honestly, if Microsoft didn't supply a 1 month trial Gold Membership, I probably wouldn't of bothered buying this thing. Once the system asks what membership you would like to have, click the Silver. It's another little jab to take some more money out of your wallet.The gaming experience is great though. You can play people online, your friends, or someone in the UK. You can send messages, download material. Good stuff."
4,Works very well - network connection issues,"Works great...once it's connected to the network. Initally the xbox could not locate my network. I have a D-Link Dir-655 router which was set up with wpa2 only security. Contrary to the manual, the xbox network adapter does not work with WPA2. The xbox website has a correction to the manual. Once I figured this out I changed the security to wpa/wpa2 and the network appeared. The game console is downstairs and it has a good connection."
1,Any Wifi adapter will do,"For those of you who are still behind the wireless movement going on for years in people's houses (setting up their internal home networks), you may have to buy this expensive piece of plastic. Otherwise, just buy any USB wifi adapter and plug it in the back of the 360. It's not like Microsoft secretly designed the Xbox 360 to only work with Xbox 360 labeled products.Oh, and by the way, the afore mentioned people who just plug in their linksys router and start using it? Thanks for the free internet."
1,What a RIPOFF!,"I'm sure this adapter works well, but Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves. Charging $90-$100 for something that should be included with the XBOX 360 Premium pack. Buy the Linksys WGA11B. It does the same thing and costs $70-$80 less. Don't Microsoft screw you out of your hard earned money. They have enough of it already."
4,Four Star+,"As a fantasy reader, you can never actually give anything but Lord of the Rings a 5 star. However, the Belgariad comes pretty close! Filled with adventures and wonderful insights into the minds of his character, David Eddings, has really created a world that I can get lost in. This series is one worth owning, one that needs to be read again and again!"
4,"A very good book, twisted plot, lot's of profesional details","This book has a great story line and a extreamly twisted plot that holds you in an unmerciful embrace. It has a lot of good detail and and is woven very tightly, no holes in the story line, for such an intricate peice. However, beware, ther are five books in this seriers and the author dosn't do a very good job at puting seperate endings on each book, in other works, once you start with this seriese, you can't stop until the end. I am at this very moment cought deep in the embrace of David Eddings' intricate tapestry, but I'm not struggling very much!!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Necromancer less than Nine.Garion's magical powers are getting stronger, it seems, as he now has the ability to raise the dead. Even if not particularly a useful example when you can only do it to a horse.They still have orb retrieval issues, as more than one bad guy would be happy to have this handy little trinket.War, ghosts, shadowcat like stunts, and a good old epic magic duel to end."
3,Bit Of A Sag In The Middle.,"It's fine. I'm still feeling a bit like this was one large book that was broken into five separate ones. That said I felt a bit that this installment became a bit repetitive. I mean how many mountain passes can these characters go through? Still, my interest is still peaked to see how the series will turn out."
2,Perqs of a Princess,"Ce'Nedra, Imperial Princess of Tolnedra, is a diminutive spoiled teenage girl with piles of coppery red curly hair on her head and a temper to match. Well, of course she has no choice but to fall in love with the hero, and act suitably astonished at the deeds of her boyfriend's companions.The schtick of her people is that they don't believe in sorcery (somewhat dangerously impractical, given the legions of magical baddies abounding in this world). But she Overcomes, and Learns Lessons, and uses Girlish Ways to advance the Cause of Good. Ecch."
2,Fantasy World,"This book is filled with mystery, fantasy, and a little romance. I enjoyed reading about the quests of Ce'Nedra and her doubts about Garion, the farm boy she was destined to marry. Her feelings for Garion grew and as he was going to face the powerful magician, she was worried about his fate. Garion is on a quest to find the magical orb of Aldur, which was stolen by Zedar. His palm is silver, which gives him the power to hold the orb. When the book ends, the characters are in the middle of a battle. Garion and his band of warriors end up in enemy territory, searching for the orb."
2,You want inexpensive? you get cheap,"This is my second rib rack purchased and I should have looked at my existing rack before clicking ""buy"". This one is a bit narrower and there is no bottom lip to cradle the ribs. My first rack has a J shape to each of the racks that allows the ribs to sit nicely and not sag.Other than that this rack was packaged well, went together well and is currently sitting in my smoker. 3 hours can not go by fast enough."
4,We Help the Hopeless,"I missed a lot of this one on TV, so it's been a revelation to see the wonderful DVDs. Again, show gets 4.5 stars, DVD gets 3.5, because, dangnabbit, Joss... we need more special features!High points, so far... the closing credits for ""She.""The phantom Dennis.Just everything about ""I Will Remember You""A demon face from a sneeze.How Wesley ""Asks"" for breakfast.Buy this DVD. Keep giving Numfar more money to make new shows!"
5,What a way to steal the show!,"Applause, Applause Joss Whedon once again wows me with his amazing talent to make scarry, funny, and entertaining television. This spin off series from Buffy the Vampire Slayer almost outshines the original. Angel is a more adult, serious show that still has the wit and hummor that makes Buffy the Vampire Slayer so great. Season One of Angel follows the title character (Angel) from Sunnydale to L.A. looking for redemption quickily realizing that he can't do it alone he is joined with a memorable cast of characters (including Cordilia Chase and a much more manly Wesley Wyndam-Price) to save L.A. from the not so freindly demons and the more evil lawfirm Wolfram & Hart. This is a WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL show!!! If you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you will love Angel."
3,So So,"Great product, but there were loose discs in the box set. I would recommend more secure packaging. Thanks."
4,Interesting Take,"I enjoy mostly the noir aspects of the show, but I think this episode is a nice twist on an old story."
5,Angel rocks,"I love this show not as much as buffy but its still amazing, i just wish doyle would have stuck around for other seasons."
4,Very good,"It hurts me to say that, but Angel is a better show than Buffy in all aspects...It's a more mature show, the characters are more developed, in Buffy the characters are sometimes annoying (including Buffy) to the point of being unbearable. Also, plot holes in Angel are in much less quantity than in Buffy. Charims Carpenter assumer a whole new level to her characters, and show how such a good actress she is.Season One of Angel starts very well, and goes whtis way the whole season."
4,Pretty good spin-off,"Buffy TVS is a tough act to follow. As a fan of Buffy I inevitably had to check out Angel's series. My only complaint about Angel is that they should have named the show ""Cordelia"" as she saves the day with her self centered humor. Without Cordelia to watch I don't think I would enjoy the show's rather predictable and lackluster plots."
5,Great Start!,"This was a great season. As with many shows, it started on slightly shaky ground, but quickly found its footing. The early episodes set up the rest of the series, with the death of Doyle, the introduction of Lindsay, and Spike making an early appearance. (Spike became a regular in Season 5.)"
5,To Live and Die in L..A.,"It was really nice to go back and watch these early episodes of Angel. You forget how much the show has changed over the last few years. Of course, the producers have included plenty of dvd extras.And it's great to have them all at instant access with no commercials at dvd quality."
3,Angel - Season 1,"I would rank this much higher but I know the later seasons, especially Season 5, are much better."
5,City of Angel,"""Angel"" Season 1 was a great begining to another classic series. It has a much darker vibe than ""Buffy"" due to it's lead character, who only comes out at night, and it's setting. Doyle was a great character who was lost way too soon, but it was good to see Wesley back in the mix. There are a number of crossovers between this season and ""Buffy"" season five, so it is worth having for that reason alone. I liked all the episodes in this season, execept ""She"". Most episodes are self contained, unlike the expansive stories in the rest of the seasons."
5,Love it!,I love this show. I can't wait to get the other seasons. (So I can watch them together with Buffy). There isn't anything super special about it (like the extras or behind the scenes stuff) but if you are a fan of the show it is nice to watch it without commercials or have an Angel marathon on a rainy weekend.
1,sorry... disappointing,"this show was actually quite funny and exciting... BUT ... for anyone with a religios or chrstian background it is a disappointing show, if not downright offensive. when I started watching the first few episodes I found it quite amusing and the acting was done well. but witchcraft, spell casting, and curses became more prevalent than anything else. and it only grew worse. after about 4-5 episodes I actually could not stomach it anymore and threw it in the garbage. ""WARNING"" to parents, if you dont mind the demonology, buy it... but if witchcraft and spell casting, and possession offends you then BEWARE."
5,As good as it gets,"I have been a huge fan of Buffy and Angel since their inception. Now that Buffy is coming out on DVD I hope that Angel follows soon. This is just a great show. Angel, like Buffy, has it all-humor, horror, drama, suspense. Please release Angel on DVD so that we can enjoy it!"
4,A Fun Series,"I missed this series when it first aired, but I'm glad I picked up the DVD.While never up to the level of the Buffy series, Angel is quite entertaining and has a lot of little funny bits. The pilot episode for example has one part where he runs out to his car, jumps in dramatically, tries the key...and nothing. Then he looks over and sees he jumped into the wrong (identical) car; his car is parked a few spaces over.There is also a great episode involving a bachelor party that should not be missed. How many shows have somebody admonished for bringing a shrimp fork to devour a human brain? The whole episode is very tongue in cheek.I don't want to give any spoilers, but there is a rather significant change around the middle of the season that I appreciated. You'll see a number of cross-over guests from Buffy to start out the show. At over twenty episodes, the season should keep you satisfied for a while."
4,A great first season,"Buffy's undead love has moved to the big city of Los Angeles. With a colorful cast of supporting characters, he establishes a detective agency to 'help the hopeless', and to battle the evil lawfirm: Wolfram and Hart.While this season has is flawed episodes, overall it is one of the better shows on television. The show it spun from, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, set the bar for quality high, and Angel does its best to reach it."
5,Great !!,"I absolutly love the series Angel the first season aka this DVD collection is great I can't wait for the second season to be released! This DVD brings you through all the emotions sad, scared, angery, it makes you laugh it's thrilling, captivating, adventureus; sorry about going on but it's just great I recommened you check this out!"
5,Angel episode''She'',I have always like Buffy and Angel I have been a big fun of Bai Ling and do I need to say more
4,loved this,"I loved Angel when it was first released. It was a spin off from buffy, so I wasn't expecting much, but this was different in it's own way. Completely gripping. I loved all of the episodes. Well recommended."
3,OK Not great,"I was hoping the screen saver would have more realistic fish. They are OK, but not as good as some I have seen on other PC's. I also have not found a way to have the screen saver start automatically after a designated number of minutes of inactivity."
3,Older issue,Would not run under WinVista. No indication of why. Need to get a newer version but not easy to find.
4,"Classic '70's ""Middle of the Road"" pop","The first album released by this quintessential Australian band. The main songwriters (Gerard ""Beeb"" Birtles and Graham Goble) have put together some finely crafted material. Good lyrics, catchy tunes and hot guitar licks, makes this a very good album. Don Henley from the Eagles reckons LRB is the ""Best singing band in the world"" and it's easy to hear why he says so..........."
4,The Debut Little River Band album,The first album recorded by the Australian Little River Band is probably their finest apart from their second album After Hours. Prior to their MOR/Pop personna of the 80's this album has their original rock/jazz/country fusion laced with impressive harmonies. Along with Mellencamps' Scarecrow and Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road a must have for an album collection.
4,"Hey Everybody, Yeah-ah","Having been owner of only the Greatest Hits, I decided it was time to sample the other material of LRB and I was very pleased. Other than the known hits, the rest of the music is better than okay and is well worth a listen. I hope to be able to have a complete collection of all LRB's material in the near future."
4,I really liked this product. I did notice ...,"I really liked this product. I did notice a difference in my skin -- it felt renewed and soft. It was very easy to use, didn't leave my face feeling dry, and improved the look of my skin. I'll probably continue to use this product, and would recommend to others looking for something like this!"
1,I haven't noticed any changes in my skin. ...,"I haven't noticed any changes in my skin. Actually, I seem to have had a few breakouts in the past few days. I'm not sure if they're from using this product or not, but as of now, I don't see any improvement in my skin."
3,okay product,"I bought this based on other reviews (not just from amazon). I really don't find it to do anything spectacular. It is light, has no objectionable odor, and probably does what it says it does but my preferred toner type product is Dessert Essence cleansing pads."
2,Don't want to use it,I brought this product last month but I don't like its smell and sometimes it makes my skin painful. I tried using it for one week but I can hardly see any work. I just decided to stop using it because it always makes my face painful. Maybe it's because my skin is too sensitive.
1,Good....but not good enough.,"I was somewhat skeptical when searching for a pore refiner because I've had a lot of flops in the past. Unfortunately, this product falls in line with all the other failed experiments. After six weeks of use, I've seen no change in the size of my pores. However, I did notice that my skin has been less oily since I began using the product. That's nice and all, but my chief reason for the purchase was to see the promised reduction in pore size. It just hasn't happened."
4,Pretty good toner,Overall I am very satisfied with this toner....Not perfect but but better than the others I have tried...Will buy again
4,Noticable difference but dries skin,"I use this approximately every other day due to the drying it causes but after a week or so, my pores were visibly reduced, not gone just not as noticeable. Just a splash on a cotton square and I go in upwards motions after my morning face wash and before I moisturize. I will continue to use but will not use everyday as my skin is prone to dryness. It worked in all areas of my face, my nose and forehead were most noticeable to me and now they are much smaller. Recommend to anyone looking for an easy way to reduce size of large pores."
3,clean but has alcohol smell,"I use the toner to clean my face and neck. I found that since I don't wear foundation or powder, the toner does not really pick up any more dirt from my face, as long as I have washed my face with a face washcloth. This is an optional step that you might not need after all, and you could save some money to skip it. The alcohol smell is quite strong, for I have to close my eyes and stop breathing until the smell evaporates. I don't think I will continue using any toner after this bottle."
2,No noticable difference!,I have noticed over the last few years my pore sizes has increased. It is crazy and now it really bothers me! I tried this along with many other products but I did not notice any difference! If you like a toner its not a bad one pretty gentle but don't expect no more pores!
4,It's Great!,I love this stuff. It cleans your skin very thoroughly and leaves it very soft. I love the smell too! Overall I'm very please with this and will continue to buy.
2,Dries out my skin,"I have combination skin and this dries it out to the point of being painful. I didn't notice any difference with the appearance of my pores, which are still big. I suffered for nothing."
3,Great for acne but there are side effects,"I've had acne for almost 10 years and I know more about acne medication than most people I meet. I have large pores, oily skin. Now that I'm older, hormonal acne is not the primary cause but rather the oily skin that attracts the bacteria. I've tried Retin A with good succeed but the product will thin out your skin and cause indented scars(at least for me). It also made my face feel and look very red.I'm going to cut this short and boldly say that glycolic acid can also cause acne scars (indented)if used as your daily regimen. I used this toner 2x a day for a few months and it has helped with my acne but left indented scars. I did not pick or pop the blemish. Years ago, I used a glycolic lotion on my face and that also caused indented scars. I used that for a few months, also.I believe glycolic acid should only be used a few times a week, give or take, depending on your skin type. If you have oily skin, exfoliating more often is a given."
4,Does the Job,"After reading all the reviews I guess I was expecting a super great product. It does a good job. Not sure if it works better than other products. I will be trying some others to see how they work before going through the hassle of ordering online. After trying a few other products, I may decide it is worth the extra work to order online."
5,Great Toner,I have very large pores and this works great..My skin is smooth and healthy looking after every use! Very clean smell.
1,Terrible Mount,"I replaced all 3 engine mounts on my mother's 2001 Focus and they all failed within 3 months. This mount caved in on itself and caused vibrations to return. I generally buy aftermarket parts because they are similar quality to OEM and much cheaper, but this is one scenario where you need to go OEM."
3,Not what I asked for,"Ok, so I just opened the package and the 1st thing i thought was THIS IS NOT WHAT I ORDERED! I am not to happy with that! The book was Ben-Hur but it wasnt what was shown to me online. I am not a fan of buying on line anymore. My other problem is this book WAS NOT worth the amount they asked. It wasnt even fair condition. STEER Clear of these Sellers! Thumbs down for Baker Book Store!"
4,I really liked this toothbrush. It worked much ...,I really liked this toothbrush. It worked much better than the ones I've been using in the past. It cleaned more thoroughly and I'd highly recommend this item. My family will be switching to this brand in the future.
2,Spoiler alert,"This is a decent but mostly run of the mill film. I was fairly interested in how the plot line would resolve itself but hugely disappointed in the incredibly simplistic and clumsy manner in which Baines the butler was exonerated. Furthermore, none of the characters stood out to me as anything more than typical murder mystery types. Had Baines shot himself when he took the gun from the drawer it would have made for a much better ending."
3,"""Some lies are just kindness.""","The ""idol"" is Baines (Ralph Richardson), the butler in the French embassy in London and the ambassador's little son, Philippe (Bobby Henrey), is the one who loves and worships him. Baines is devoted to the boy and never tires of spending time with him, regaling him with tall tales that Philippe believes, of course. One day, Baines asks Philippe to keep a big secret from the hateful Mrs. Baines and this secret eventually changes all of their lives.This wonderful movie was made in 1948 and directed by Carol Reed. Richardson is flawless and little Bobby Henrey gives one of the very best child performances ever. He is completely natural, a real boy who dotes on his pet snake and would do anything for Baines, and acts in both English and French. The story is a domestic drama turned homicide investigation and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Heartily recommended."
3,Murder suspicion of a young child,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""The Fallen Idol"" is about the young son of the French Ambassador to the UK who thinks he sees the butler commit a murder. He gives information about the incident and nobody believes him.The film is directed by Carol Reed who directed the smash hit ""The Third Man"" the following year.The Criterion Collection edition includes the original pressbook and a 2006 documentary on Carol Reed for the special features.This is a very nice film and has elements of other well known stories."
1,A strongly romantic interpretation on modern instruments,"This recording is definitely not for listeners concerned about historically informed performance: the use of modern (metal?) instruments and little or very soft ""legato"" articulation produces a sound very remote from that what is considered nowadays an authentic performance style for early baroque music.I nevertheless give it one star rather than none, because people inclined to romantic flute music might like this recording. Moreover it is an interesting demonstration how deep the gap is between classically trained performers and performers specialised in early music."
2,Disapointing,"I am a big fan of Tom Holt, who writes ""intelligent"" fantasy in an incredibly funny style. He is best when he sticks to subjects related to mythology (classical, Aurthurian... just about anything, actually) and history, as that is what his background is. This book, on the other hand, felt like a rush job. Parts of it made no sense (even for a book about elves), the characters were one dimensional and trite, and the book dragged on f-o-r-e-v-e-r and should have ended about five times before it actually did.If you are interested in reading a laugh-out-loud fantasy book by someone who knows his mythology, read ""Flying Dutch"" or ""Expecting Someone Taller"" or ""Odds and Gods"" or anything that has a historical or mythological basis before you form an opinion of Tom Holt. He really does have his brilliant moments: this book, however, is not one of them."
2,"Great Lines, Not Great Ending","Tom Holt stories are typically more than a bit eccentric and fantastic, with a hefty dash of humor - word play and situations that might be at home in Terry Pratchett (Guards,Guards or Witches Abroad period more than the more-recent novels) or Douglas Adams book - almost always in the displaced-fish-out-of-water mold. Like Pratchett, Holt stories often have a large dose of supernatural or magic in them, but many of them take place in England. Great ingredients for light hearted fun.This book has some of the best individual lines and a great premise, but the characters aren't as engaging as usual or even likable, and even worse, the ending is flat-out depressing. I found it the least re-readable of his books.For an introduction to his funner, lighter-escapism with great humor, try Snow White and the Seven Samauri, or Who's Afraid of Beowolf."
3,Average for Holt,"Michael Higgins sees elves. At the age of eight he saw his first one smoking in his family's garden. When he told his step-father about it, the reaction he received was so surprisingly abrupt and alarming that he knew what he had seen was real and that his step-father (the owner of a shoe-making factory - can you say ""miniature slave labor force""?) was aware of them.Tom Holt is a British fantasy author that I feel has way too small of a readership on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. He's written thirty-something humorous fantasy novels yet is still widely unknown here in the States. His books are inventive, smart, and oftentimes, the literary equivalent of a Monty Python sketch."
5,Realistic and,The next day on the job was always full of surprises. I could not put it down. A great and realistic read about the sweat and toil of the paper/lumber trade in Oregon. Bucchi goes undercover and you feel almost like you working next to him as he attempts to find the good and the bad within the organization's entry level employees; all the while trying to fit in and not stand out. Very ture and realistic in how the soical structures of the blue collar workforce operate within a given organization. You never know what your neighbor is doing or what they are involved in. A good read...
2,Read with a grain of salt...,"While the subject was interesting, and Bucchi seems a pretty good story teller, I got tired of his ego. Throughout the entire book you keep reading how he is the greatest investigator he knows, and he is always the center of the action. He is cetainly the hero and he wants you to know it. I also got very tired him thinking that he is the only one who speaks with proper grammar and understands puns, and how his wit is just too sharp for everyone around him. This book will keep you entertained and is an easy read, but don't take it as strictly a non-fiction biography..."
4,suspicious reviews!,"I read this book a few years ago, and now realize it is likely fiction. I have done no research of any kind, but come on... drugs that can be molded into boat hulls? Wasn't that in a Cheech & Chong movie?! A couple of these reviews which put the author in a good light seem to be written by a slightly odd, average guy using big words; likely the author himself, trying to sell more books! It was pretty entertaining if you assume it's non-fiction. The shoot-out at the end, the breaking of the guy's arm, and the wooden splinters going through buttocks, all add up to me to one thing; fiction! Try John Douglas or Ronald Kessler for some good real-life FBI stories."
1,Dubious,"I've worked undercover as a, ""corporate spy."" I've supervised other undercover corporate investigations. I believe about a third of this story. I don't think a bit of experience is needed to see that there are holes in his story large enough to accommodate a Mack truck."
1,Do not add water,"This is the second watch we ordered. First one leaked after my girl went swimming with it. We ordered another one thinking that we will be lucky the second time around... well, we were not. This watch is supposed to be water resistanct to 20m, but it didn't even hold 1 meter underwater. We've lost all confidence in Timex watches."
3,do what's best for you,"i had a hysterectomy 3 years ago and couldn't do it laproscopically because the fibroid inside my uterus was as big as a football. no matter what book i read, the choice was clear. i needed the hysterectomy. i was terrified and it turns out to be the best thing i ever did. no more periods, intense bleeding, or pain. listen to your bodies and your doctors. my hysterectomy and previous c-sections were not optional or elective surgeries, but they all saved a life. so don't let a book written by a man disuade you. make your own informed choice. good luck!"
1,Who paid for this book anyway?,"Sometimes I wonder who pays for these extended ads for suffering with your problems instead of having a hysterectomy. I don't doubt that there are a few women who have hysterecetomies recommended to them who could do OK without. Just like there are people who start a business in their garage and make it into the Fortune 500. But the *majority* of women who are having awful periods, terrible pain, hurt like hell every time they have ..., and so on are well rid of their uterus. Having a hysterectomy was the best thing I ever did. Even ... is 100 times better! So who's promoting these scare-stories? The only people who gain from women suffering needlessly are the insurance companies who can pay their execs a few more figures with our ""health"" dollars! What **MAN** would put up with bleeding every month and constant/unpredictable pain from an organ he was no longer interested in using?"
2,Older versions were made much better,"I purchased this game for my grandson as he had played it with me on an old game set (about 15 years old), I couldn't believe the cheapness and lack of quality of the new game board, all playing pieces and the poorly printed money (only printed on one side and almost all the $10 bills came cut in half). Also its strange that the old version money denominations went up to $5,000 and the new one only $1,000, I guess we've experienced deflation in recent years? The game itself is great (counting, adding, subtraction and strategy for kids), so if you can find a quality constructed version of the game and get what you pay for."
4,Inexplicably popular with my toddler,"My 18-month-old daughter can't get enough of this book; she carries it around the house, begging, ""moh moh... jo jo"", which is her way of asking for ""more Jonah"". Her interest wanes after the fish regurgitates our hero, and usually we then start over from the beginning. A single read is never enough, alas. I give this advice to all those in a similar predicament: partial relief from the tedium is had by singing the book's rhymes to the tune of ""The ballad of Gilligan's Island."" Try it, it works. Coincidence? I doubt it."
5,"Great way to open discussion of obedience, forgiveness and more!","This book is outstanding! My 2 toddlers love to hear this one at bedtime. It gives us such a wonderful opportunity to talk on their level about how God requires obedience, but forgives us and still loves us when we don't listen if we say we are sorry. Like someone else mentioned in their review, I'm online today to order several more of these stories for the kids' Easter baskets. The rhyme of the story does not distract from the message, which is great! The illustrations are perfectly suited for a child's imagination. Quit reading reviews and BUY the books- you won't regret it."
5,quality bible story,"Grandma found this at a garage sale for my 1 yr old. We have multiple different bible story books, but this one sticks close to the biblical account, and with engaging rhyming text. I like how Alice summarizes the moral of the story at the end. I'd never heard of these books, but excited to see there's a whole collection!"
