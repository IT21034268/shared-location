3,its ok. nothing great.,"[...] bucks for 120 tea bags. not bad. One thing about sweet dreams (for me at least) is that the tea doesnt really do much, except taste good. I dont really get mellow, tired, at all after drinking this tea. Real chamomile tea taste bad and literally smells, so Im glad that this version with mint drowns out the taste. Thats all I can really say about this tea, it tastes good but does not help or provide a better night sleep. Probably because I have insomnia, but I think the whole sweet dreams is a placebo, people see it like me and think ""oh this will put me to sleep"" when in reality you are just putting yourself to sleep by thinking the product will knock you out. Just my opinion though, if it works for you then good for you."
2,Too much caffeine,"I'm a big lover of Earl Grey, but I find the Bigelow version to have an enormous amount of caffeine. I can drink most (For example, Twinings) any time of day, but if I have a cup of Bigelow after 2pm or so, I won't sleep that night."
1,Very disappointed.,This tea has a very weak flavor of raspberry. Other Bigelow teas have a much better flavor than this. We had ordered this by a mistake and were very taken back by the lack of taste. Try the red rasberry--very good!
2,Could be better,I'm normally a fan of Bigelow Green Teas but their Blueberry flavor was disappointing.It really doesn't have a strong Blueberry taste. It is actually somewhat bland.I won't purchase it again.
4,Great tea!,Bigelow's Green Tea product line is pretty nice. I tried this peach flavored green tea recently and found it really nice. It does what it says. A dalicate peach flavor in nice green tea. You can read the full review at [...] about this tea. This tea is must a try for all peach flavor lovers.DO NOT Steep the bag more than 2.5 to 3 Minutes else you will start having strong over boiled green tea (little bitterish) like after taste.I wanted to give 4.5 but as I can't do that so I gave it a 4.
4,Good Green Tea,"I just purchased this tea after using Salada Decaffinated Green Tea. This is a good product. It has a fold pouch containing 4 tea bags. Take one out and you can fold down the pouch to reseal it. I have to admit that I do prefer the Salada brand over Bigelow, however. One advatage Bigelow has is it organic, Salada is not."
1,Can't taste the raspberry,The taste of this product is not raspberry enough. I had hoped to find the flavor of the cold raspberry tea found in fountain drinks. Arizona Raspberry Iced Tea is the closest that I have found. Snapple Raspberry Tea is a close second. It was not the taste that I was looking for and I will try a different product next time I order tea.
4,Use this for tea blends,"This product is great for making iced tea blends.It's not great by itself, but try mixing it with regular Lipton black tea bags to make some really good flavored iced tea."
2,FS,Was not too happy with the flavor. It doesn't give the original flavor that Earl Grey usually has.
3,Not just green tea and mango....,"I'm a pretty big fan of traditional tea (i.e. not herbal tea). I figured this would just be green tea with some mango pieces. I later found out by reading the ingredients, that it has other herbs like chamomile, rose hips etc. While this tea doesn't taste horrible, I just thought the box was sort of misleading and the amazon community should be aware of these additions."
4,Packaging is not in individual bags!,"Be warned that this product does not individually wrap the tea bags but rather has them in groups of four. So there are ten foil packages each containing four bags, total 40 count per box. The foil package instructs to fold over the package for any remaining tea bags, but that is highly impractical as the foil package is too stiff for that. And often the package tears in such a way upon opening as to be useless afterward.Other Bigelow 20 count box tea that I've purchased do have individual packaging for each tea bag, so if that matters to you, choose the 20 count instead of this 40 count. The price is slightly higher, so there's a trade-off.The tea itself is quite a bit stronger than Twinnings. Its flavor is good, but I'm not convinced this is the best Earl Grey. But for the price, it's certainly a good option for Earl Grey drinkers."
3,Misleading,"Item's picture shows box with 40 tea bags, totaling 2.56 OZ (72g). What I have actually got is box with 40 tea bags, totaling 1.73 OZ (49g)! You will get very little tea in one bag - approximately 1.2 grams. That is rip-off! Thanks to Amazon customer service for appropriate partial refund. Tea is very good though!"
2,Disappointing.,"I'm always looking for a good flavored tea, and I usually love Chai. This was a disappointment. Not enough spice."
3,taste,I am so disappointed with this tea. Got the tea today and couldn't wait to drink it but it tastes nothing like the oolong you get in a Chinese restaurant.
2,Gave me headaches,"I seeped one bag in about two an a half cups of water and drank throughout the day. Although I feel as though it kind of detox-ed me, I had the most horrible headache. I thought maybe it was something else but I stopped drinking it anyway until the headache went away. Once I resumed drinking, the headaches came back. I have since stopped drinking the tea and now I am back to normal. IDK if I had a bad batch or maybe it just doesn't work well with my body but now I have 39 tea bags that I can't use, lol."
4,Excellent Basic Caffeinated Tea,"This unpretentious tea is simple to make since it requires no additional input other than boiling water - it already has the lemon included. With other teas, I always had to worry about adding a few drops of lemon juice or milk to cut the tannin taste but with Lemon Lift, none of that is necessary. It provides the caffeine kick I need, tastes great, and requires minimum effort to prepare. Each tea bag comes hermetically sealed so there is no danger that it will degrade with time. Buy the six pack with 20 tea bags per box, and always have it on hand at home and at work when you need it. A box makes a great present for your tea-drinking friends as well.Enjoy!"
4,Great tea,This is my favorite night time tea. The only thing that would make it better is evolving it into the K-Cup format!
5,Bigelow Green Tea with Mint,"My Mom drinks this tea with honey, on a daily basis. She loves it, so we have it on Subscribe and Save to make sure she always has it on hand. The price on Amazon is really good!"
3,"Okay, but not as promised...","I expected individually wrapped tea bags...I got 4 in a pack! This wouldn't have been a problem except that I wanted the individual wrapping as these were for work. So I can use one & then I have to leave the opened wrapper in my desk which can make the tea stale. I have since kept the opened wrapper in a plastic bag, but would have prefered the individual wrapping as stated.Overall, the tea is good. Good flavor when steeped for a few minutes before drinking. I sweeten it with a little agave & it makes a good cuppa tea."
5,Yum!,"I was so happy to find Amazon carried Perfect Peach tea! My grocery store stopped carrying it and I was down to my last few bags before it occurred to me to search online (duh!)I love to drink this warm and sweetened with just a bit of honey. I find it very soothing, especially when PMS is causing cramps or I have an upset stomach."
5,It's always tea time!,"As in the words of Charles Dickens...""My dear, if you could give me a cup of tea to clear my muddle of a head I should better understand your affairs."" I take that to heart!Okay, this tea is a mix of black tea(contains caffeine) and spearmint. As many of you already know, drinking spearmint tea has many health benefits. Personally, I prefer spearmint tea over any other herbal tea and I drink this Bigelow one during the morning and afternoon time. I drink another spearmint tea brand(caffeine-free) at night before bed.The packaging is excellent. The individual tea bags are wrapped up in an individual packet(envelope) of their own..unlike some other brands that have all the tea bags in one big packet. The packets are great for women to carry in their purses or men to carry in their pockets, making it convenient for a person to make a cup of tea elsewhere(e.g. the office)"
5,Delicious way to add green tea to your diet,"Black tea is full of antioxidants, and green tea even more so. Very likely because many consumers consider green tea a bit on the bland side, Bigelow decided to blend it with their flavorful, delicious, 70-year-old, all-star tea, Constant Comment. This tea is a terrific way to start the day. Green tea energizes without causing the jitters.Highly recommended."
5,Bigelow Red Raspberry Herbal Tea,Lovely tea!!! This tea can be used for hot or cold but my preference is to make iced tea with it and it is most refreshing to have for our AZ summers!
4,Great Deal and Tasty,"If you're looking for chai like you get from real tea stores this product is a great alternative to buying the expensive brands. If you're looking for the ""chai"" sold at gas stations, this is not it. Be sue to add cream and sweetener for an autheic chai flavor. To make this vanilla chai, just add vanilla creamer. Tastes awesome."
3,What green?,"Hmmm. Maybe it's just me but this ""green"" tea brews brown. I snapped up a box of this at my local supermarket since I didn't have time to drive across town to the asian market for my usual brand. The taste of this is fine but it does seem to taste more like a mild black tea. Maybe this is a bad box or maybe the decaffeinating process has effected the cathechins and thus the color? I don't drink this stuff for the flavor or color. I want to be antioxidized to the max so I think I'll be buying my other brand of tea next (it's packaged in Japan and not the US for whatever it's worth.)"
5,Sweet Dreams Herb Tea,"Sweet Dreams Herb Tea is very good, especially when you are having a difficult time of trying to sleep. I have many a times woke up in the middle of the night and could not get back to sleep. Had myself a cup of Sweet Dreams Tea and along with just relaxing by reading or doing a puzzle from a book, it has helped me to go back to sleep. Usually when I have woke up in the middle of the night, also having RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome), I take my medication, have myself a cup of Sweet Dreams Tea, and am usually up for probably no more than one hour and back to bed and to sleep I go. Has a very good taste as well. I always keep a box in the cupboard. Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy."
5,Hard to find the Cinnamon Stick Tea,"I LOVE this tea. It can be hard to find when not the Christmas holiday season. No problem, buy a case at Amazon and stock up. Totally pleased with it and happy to have a supply on hand (even though it still won't last long as I drink it 5 mornings a week!)"
5,BEST TEA!,"I have been drinking this tea for over 6 years now. I have tried many other types of tea and brands, but nothing comes close to Bigelow French Vanilla! It's sweet and strong enough you can taste the vanilla in it, but it is still a good black tea. The decafe version is also great!"
1,4 bags per package.,Why?I needed individually wrapped bags. The listing should really day 4bags per package. Highly disappointing and basically useless to me.
1,Tastes like cheap pancake syrup,"I bought this tea after reading all of the positive reviews. I have long enjoyed Lipton's Caramel Vanilla Truffle tea and read that this tea was better, so I gave it a try. It smells awesome when steeping, but that is when the positives stopped. It seriously tastes like a thinner version of cheap pancake syrup. There is no vanilla flavor whatsoever, just a strong butter aftertaste. If you haven't tried this tea before don't buy the 6 pack - get a single box. I understand that different people have different tastes, so know what you are getting into before you commit to 6 boxes."
1,Terrible,"I got this today from Wholefood based on all reviews. It is very weak. No tea flavor watery, Worst decaf tea I have tasted. Even Tetley decaf is better.The best decaf tea is Barry'sDoes not deserve any star."
2,Not a fan - weird spice in it,I don't care for Bigelow's version of their Spiced Chai. They don't list their ingredients on the box - but this definitely has something strange in it. I bought it because I couldn't find my regular brand - but I'll be giving these away. :(
1,YUCK,"Initially this flavor sounded good, but it has something off about it in the taste. Think twice as you can not return stuff like this."
5,Bigelow Tea,"I was very glad to finally find a way to recieve my favorite tea. I am unable to purchase Cinnamon Stick Tea in the Nashville and surrounding areas...and drank it on a daily basis when we lived in Texas. So when I searched and found you had it, I was thrilled. The price is very fair. I bought 6 boxes and the price total for each box and shipping were close to the grocery price I had been paying. Another, YEAH!! I will order again and again. It took less than 48 hours to arrive once my order had been placed. This was way above your 5 star rating!!!"
4,Great Tea,"Bigelow's Vanilla Caramel tea is delicious. It has a wonderful aroma. The flavor is delicate, soothing, and mellow. It is perfectly blended with the caramel and vanilla flavors. Makes for a very satisfying cup of tea, or a glass of iced tea."
5,very good,"I've tried lots of more expensive flavored teas but all of them seem to suffer from either the fruit flavor being so weak that you can barely taste it, or else so strong that it entirely overpowers the flavor of the tea. This one seems to do a good job of falling in the middle. The mango flavor is definitely noticeable but (at least to me) not overpowering. Adds a nice smell to the whole room as well. Highly recommended."
5,Wonderful smooth flavor...,"This is my all time most favorite tea. I always feel ""special"" when I sit down and pour a cup of this tea.This combination of fruit and spices really calms the nerves and is a wonderful ending to my day."
5,My Favorite Tea,"I drink this tea by the case.On it's own, this tea has a light taste with a hint of sweet jasmine. Add a touch of honey to the hot brew and you have a wonderful soothing drink.I also drink it as iced tea. It requires very little sweetening and is very refreshing."
3,just so-so,"I recently got hooked on the eggnog flavor and when I couldn't find the eggnog again in my local supermarket, I bought one box of this to try because I love anything caramel. I was a little disappointed because the flavor was very weak and didn't seem to have much of a vanilla/caramel flavor at all. Smelled great but the flavor wasn't as strong as I thought it would be. I wouldn't invest in a six pack without trying first. I'll finish my box of 20 tea bags but not sure if I'll purchase again. I really wanted to love it but it didn't work out for me."
2,Not GREEN,My quest to find THE perfect green tea led me to 'Bigelow'. A big name in the tea industry.I steeped a Japanese green tea (Sencha) in one clear glass mug and Bigelow's in another glass mug.Rules: allow the boiling water to sit for 4 min. Then gently steep for 4 min. Place onto a large pure white table top.The difference was dramatic. The Bigelow's green tea looked brown next to the Sencha tea.The taste was just as dramatic. Bitter initial flavor with a dull harsh after taste vs. A Smooth consistent green tea flavor.I repeated this 3 weeks later with a different batch of Bigelow's. Same difference.So if it's GREEN tea your looking for - Bigelow's is not the one.
2,WEAKSAUCE,"The quality of the tea itself is not the problem here(though it is not that great), its the quantity in each bag that I have an issue with. Compared to other brands of organic green tea, these bags seem to contain about half as much green tea leaves, causing me to use two bags for each cup of tea I brew, otherwise I just end up with a dissatisfying cup of weak tea. Go to Trader Joe's and get a box of their organic green tea,their tea bags are filled generously, and your tea will be a nice bright green!I'm sure there are other great brands of organic green tea, I just have had great experiences with the Trader Joe's brand. Bigelow brand seems to be trying to make up for the more expensive costs of providing you with organic tea by skimping on the amount in each bag. I really don't blame them though, they gotta keep profit margins up in these tough times."
3,Don't brew too long,Definitely do not brew for longer than two minutes. You may want to also try letting the boing water cool down for a few minutes first before using it. If it brews too long or too hot it becomes very bitter.
1,Not my cup of tea,"Because this got such good reviews, I decided to try it as a substitute for my favorite Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai, which has disappeared from my local grocery store. This is some of the worst chai I've ever tasted. It had a very strong artificial vanilla flavor, and none of the after bite that good black teas should have. It was so bad that I could not force myself to finish the box. I do like their classic Constant Comment, but I cannot recommend this Vanilla Chai."
4,Good show as always.,"I enjoyed this move when it first came out and I have seen it on TV or rental since. It combines all my favorites: Star Trek, Time Travel, drama and comedy, and defeating the Borg. Great romp by many of my favorite characters and character actors. I can't think of any downside to this movie even if you are not familiar with Star Trek TNG. Resistance is Futile."
4,Interesting Stories,"Ambrose Bierce was at his best with his horror and civil war stories. This collection of short stories includes both but focuses more on the horror. H.P. Lovecraft was fond of the opening story ""The Death of Halpin Frayser"" and this is an interesting tale, but I'd say the best stories in this volume are ""The Monnlit Road"", ""Beyond the Wall"", ""The Middle Toe of The Right Foot"", and ""John Mortonson's Funeral"". ""The Damned Thing"" ended up in the TV series ""Masters of Horror"".These stories have a unique flavor and transport you to 19th century America."
5,Cherished classic!!,"One of the classics of trekdom - have owned one copy or another since it first came out. The 1701 refit from TMP on, to me, has always been the most graceful sci-fi vehicle that has ever graced any screen. A must-have, and a shame it's out of print!"
3,Only by your touch,"I enjoyed this book. However, I think that I'll stick with Ms. Andersons historicals. I happen to be about the same age as her heroine and I found that the dialogue & perspective just did not ring true. As I read I found myself thinking ""how OLD are these people?"" Also another thing I find annoying w/ Catherine Anderson is that she gives many of the same traits to her heroines book after book. For instance this is the THIRD novel that I've read by this author in which the heroine has night blindness. I mean really how common is this?! With that being said, when I read a novel by this author I expect a sweet old fashion love story and that's what she wrote. Despite my nit picking I enjoyed the book especially the super natural aspect."
3,Did not like as well as other reviewers,"I just want to start out by saying that this was a good book, but I would not read it again. I didn't think that Ben Longtree and Chloe had any romance at all. It was more of an animal lover book. Ben Longtree could secretly heal living things, and it's great that he could because someone was shooting all the animals in the woods. They automatically knew to go right to him after they were wounded. He was also a vet and healed them back to health. You get to learn a lot about his native american heritage and horrible past with his father. Chloe had an ex-husband that makes you think he is still in the picture, but then you never hear a word about him throughout the end of the book. This book just left me with more questions than answers."
4,"Top-notch Canadian thriller with great suspense, acting","I first saw this film in 1979, and it was much better than what I was expecting. This is a good example of a ""B"" movie that far surpasses so many of the heavily hyped ""A"" productions. Elliott Gould and Christopher Plummer are outstanding in their roles, with solid work from Susannah York and the then virtually unknown John Candy. The plot is compelling all the way through, the suspense never falters, and the logic is ""airtight"", for people like myself who are annoyed with thrillers that don't thrill, and plots that have more holes than the pavement in downtown Belgrade. Only a single scene of gruesome and gratuitous violence detracts from what is a really fine film of its kind."
3,"Quiet, holds up fairly well","Made in 1975, this is interesting for its period decors and styles. It's a little low-watt in the energy and suspense department by today's standards. Whatever happened to Elliott Gould, you wonder? A small movie, worth a re-look."
4,Canadian Gem,"I wasn't sure what to expect of this film, however I was pleasantly suprised to find it to be a first rate thriller. The cast is excellent, and Celine Lomez is very capable as an actress and absolutely beautiful. My only complaint with the film is a gruesome dispatching of one of the characters. Christopher Plummer is first rate as the malevolent villain. I highly recommend this excellent low profile film."
4,Unassuming Thriller,"Elliot Gould as a mopey schmuck who gets in way over his head in a robbery scam. His life is turned upside down as he feuds with the robber he instead robs.Christopher Plummer has few lines as the sadistic criminal Gould crosses,and the viewer can only guess what kind of danger he is. Great and not overdone."
3,Chilling suspense - Gould and Plummer are excellent.,"Chilling, moody suspense. Well acted, filmed and scored, but the violence is truly graphic and should be kept away from children."
4,"Nice bag, but a bit too small.","Nice lunch bag. I bought it ages ago, but never used it. It is too small to hold a hearty lunch for an adult. It would be fine for children, or dieters, or those with smaller meal intake.Looks stylish, thermal protection of hot or cold because of wet-suit-like neoprene material. Convenient pockets, handy handles. But on the small side."
1,CHEAP - NOT WORTH THE MONEY,I was VERY unhappy with this. Took forever to arrive. Is clearly cheaply made. I returned it immediately and it took over a month to get my money back.
2,Good--for birds!,"This is a VERY small lunch ""tote."" About the size of your open hand--not as large as it looks in the picture--more like a very small zippered make up case. I like to bring two or three water bottles with me, but there would be no room--even one bottle is tight, with little room for a sandwich. Little clear plastic handles are annoying. Should be priced around $2.50--very disappointing."
1,Great 'B' movie; awful horror movie,"I am currently watching this movie, and thinking the only way I could enjoy this is to have some drunken mates with me. It's not all bad, if you can enjoy heckling a good 'B' movie. Although it boasts a copyright date of 1997, everything about it looks like 1970. You might want to make this your last purchase of a Lovecraft adaptation, after you have exhausted all else."
2,string set not long enough,just ok. string set barely 6 feet in length. did not go across deck as planned. way too expensive for what you get.
4,palm/pinapple lights,Very cute!I had to touch up paint...was kind of skimpy.They look nice on our RV!Shipped quickly.ThankYou!
1,Why?,This was purchased with the hope that the other reviews were somehow incorrect...they were not. After waiting years to have Red Hot Blue on DVD I was actually sad after watching it. Now that sadness is turning to anger. How could they do this to such an important project? It's criminal.
1,"The content is historic, the transfer horrific","If you're reading this review, you probably already know about the content of the disc. I bought the Japanese import on Laserdiscs more than 10 years ago, and was so happy to hear that it was finally coming out on DVD. It was such an important project on so many levels, not to mention the eclectic mix of artists and songs. The laserdisc was pretty good, with an additional 12"" x 12"" booklet included with the disc. It was a great presentation and transfer, and I was first in line on street date to get the DVD.I don't think that I've seen a transfer this bad on DVD, ever. It's really THAT bad. It looks like they took a worn out VHS copy of a copy and mastered it on disc. Yeah, it's that bad.I hated writing this review because I don't want to diminish sales for this project. But this DVD should be recalled, and some serious quality assurance should be applied to a remaster. Don't waste your money."
5,Good all around,"Excellent purchase. Classics revisited and redone in the late eighties by various artists. Annie Lennox's ""Every Time We Say Goodbye"" is perhaps one of the best songs she has performed. Iggie Pop and Debbie Harry are hilarious. The DVD has videos for many of these songs that I forgot even existed. The video from Tom Waites is surreal."
5,Good Condition,"I only thought I was getting a Cd, But I also got a DVD a long with it. It was in great condition and I am very pleased. Great sevice."
4,Lesbian communes,"Collected interviews, essays and photos of lesbians on women only land and in communes in the 1980s."
1,misleading,"I bought this book believing it would be a good read. The opposite occurred. It started off slow, characters were not developed, the last chapters were rushed in style and the book in whole was a total flop. Left Behind is an easy read but at least you are not forcing yourself to read and it connects the noted scriptures with the material you are reading."
5,Wonderful,A great read thrilling to the very last page. If you like Left Behind then you will like this. Hope to see a follow up.
3,More of a techno-thriller than a religious exploration,"If I want to read a techno-thriller, I'll stick with Tom Clancy. This is a well done novel on those terms, but when I read a Christian book, I'm looking to come to a better understanding of my faith. This book doesn't deliver on that level at all and left me feeling disapointed. ..."
3,Not Bad,"I thought the story was original, but not very engaging. The plot was excellent, but the characters were a bit thin. Also, the ending left me going, ""huh?""Still, if you want a different sort of read on the endtimes, this book isn't bad. I prefer the ""Christ Clone Trilogy,"" however."
5,Very scary!,This is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that you won't be able to put down. It intertwines age-old Bible prophecies with up-to-the-minute breakthrough science. The resemblance is uncanny. Five stars!
3,A decent entry in the Endtimes genre,"This is a pretty good Endtimes novel. Oddly enough, the Endtimes idea has become a bit of a genre in and of itself. Left Behind probably spured this genre despite the fact that those novels tend to be poorly written and padded. Conquest is much better than those novels. The author displays some real imagination and writes some interesting characters. It's not as good as Caldwell's We All Fall Down, the undisputed best of the genre, but it's head and shoulders above Left Behind. You can do much worse if you are a fan of this sub-section of books."
5,One of the best,"This book is on a par with Caldwell's We All Fall Down and The Christ Clone Trilogy, the best of the endtime novels. Definitly worth your time."
2,Mostly a muddled mess,"I like the concept and the technical bits and philosophical questions are worth a read. The plot however is a muddled mess. There are really only two characters you want to care about but they are not given the room to develop into believable, three dimensional characters. The novel is suppose to be tied in with end-times as in the book of Revalation, but I don't see it."
5,I looks amazing!,"As all the other figures of the collection, it is in very well made. The only problems I could notice with it are that, because of how detailed it is, it must be handed with some care (nevertheless, when it fell on the floor, it didn't get a single scratch, so it's not really fragile, just don't let it fall too much...)and it's a little hard to make it stand(but if you find the right position, it will stand still very well). So basically it's very good and the problems with it are really not a big deal. Besides, it's awesome, and who wouldn't want one of those?"
5,"Great practical videos, not fancy or decorated.","I like Les Stroud and I found that his style of showing survival from a possible ""novice"" prospective is great. The whole one man alone is amazing the fact that he lugs all the extra camera gear is a credit to his love and want to show survival from a more realistic view. ( not being followed with a bunch of experts)I have spent alot of time alone out there, and I recognize the way it shows on Les when he's filming. I highly suggest this series. This series was one of the best of it's kind with a wealth of practical information,and a non glamourous approach that just might teach someone something.Hope this helps.psJust gotta add, be cold,wet,hungry,sleep deprived for a period of time and you'd have nightmares as well. Those that know understand."
5,great show,"this is the best outdoor show i've ever seen. les is a guy you want to camp with. sense of humor, good nature, and musically inclined. i hate reality t.v., but this is my exception."
1,Not a real survival expert,"If theres a survival show to watch the first thing that comes to mind is ""Dual Survival"". They have way more knowledge and the show is much more entertaining. This show is just an average joe risking his life without a crew for 7 days. Anyone who likes this show has never seen any other survivor shows."
2,boring,"I don't know why I bought this - couldn't get through it - ok for playing guitar along but still, too silly."
4,Perfect for a Boy Scout,I really enjoy this show. I'm an Eagle Scout so this feels very similar to experiences I had at Scout camp by first learning the techniques and then applying them. I bought this as a gift for my dad who was one of our scout masters and he's enjoyed the DVD.I like Les. He's very down to earth. I wish Amazon would get Man vs Wild on DVD in the U.S.
4,Survivorman,A interesting and good survival set. Worth the price! A great buy for fans of the show or those who love exotic locations.
5,Survivorman,"The four essentials of wilderness survival are water, food, fire, and shelter. The premise of each episode of Survivorman is a wilderness adventure gone awry and the need to survive alone for seven days, improvising a shelter (he has no tent or sleeping bag), finding water and food in the environment, and starting and maintaining a fire. Les Stroud does all of the camera work himself - he is truly alone during the seven days of his ordeal. He is very personable and shows the difficulties involved by showing himself making mistakes and suffering under some of the extreme conditions he endures. This is a fascinating series and worth your attention."
4,Stamina Pilates Reformer DVD Level 2,"This is a wonderful dvd. It starts with a great basic warm up and goes into a great workout. It does freeze the frame briefly to explain moves on occassion, but this does not interfere with your workout - the count continues and jumps right into the next exercise. I like that. It is a strong workout and takes your reformer up a notch."
4,Stamina Pilates Level 2 DVD review,Stamina Pilates Level 2 DVDThis product works very well with the Stamina Products Aero Pilates Reformer I own. Marjolein Brugman is a good instructor. The only criticism I have is that sometimes (especially on level 2) she does not allow enough time for set up so I have to pause and rewind to keep up. I am planning on purchasing level 3 at some point as I already own levels 1 and 2.
4,This is a great product but it goes too fast!,"I have a pilates power gym and I'm familiar with pilates on the mat. I would suggest you have some type of reformer for these workouts as that is how they are presented and without sufficient pilates training it would be hard to convert them to a mat workout. Great workout, has taught me some extra tricks and alterations to exercises but this lady goes so fast between exercises I have to keep pausing and rewinding... slow down!! Otherwise great workout, I feel it in every muscle."
4,Recovery as well as life is only one day,"I don't think we as human beings actually recognize the power of daily reading, meditation, and reflecting. Practicing these powerful principles allows us to remain mindful of the moment and reflect upon the deeper question in our lives. To devote ourself to a daily meditation and to journal on these quiet times is priceless and will certainly aid in the evolution of our soul. For me this practice has allowed an awakening to take place and opens my life up to all the opportunities that are available in this universe. Please give this practice a try! This book will help you in your journey of living and cultivating an active consciousness in your daily life.Richard A. Singer Jr. Author Your Daily Walk with the Great Minds of the Past and Present."
4,Tekken taker,"works well for me, except i can't get my championships to show at the end. Im not sure if that is a glitch or not."
5,The glorious birth of the Tekken franchise.,"This game is a classic, I first played it at the arcade around 1996, but te game came out around 94-95. Of course, you won't find beautiful visuals, this is piece of history, one of the first 3D fighting games ever created. It was groundbreaking for it's time, and to this day I still find it addictive.Each character has a unique fighting style, and these styles keep getting inherited on every sequel, most noticeable Paul, Jack, Yoshimitsu and Law. The Playstation version actually expands the arcade version, adding ending movies and extra characters. There is an arcade version in Tekken 5 as part of the bonus arcade history games, Tekken 2 and 3 are also included.If you enjoyed games like Rival Schools, Mortal Kombat 4 or Dead or Alive, you definately need to play this."
2,The start of the best game seris ever,"The graphics and gameplay are very out dated. The movies at the end are stupid and only the first eight players have them. The only reason I even got this game is because I loved Tekken 2,3,Tag, and 4. The only reason I don't sell this is I want to have all the tekkens, but if you want to buy it, don't pay more than $2 for it."
2,THIS NEEDS WORK!!!!!!!!,"This tekken game is definetley a""A go home and do it again"".I know this game is old, but it really needs work.I have talked really well of the other tekken games,in my opinion this game is terrible.The graphics are ok, the fighting isnt that good.I guese this game isnt so bad,but i would not recomend it.Other tekken games are all really awsome I would definetley try tekken4,tekken3,and tekkentag.All in all tthis game is ok,if you have a chance to get this game,dont buy it for over fifteen dollars.note:this game is pretty rare,(at least in the city i live in).If your that into tekken, keep it for a rare collectors piece.So il'l see you later,bye."
4,Disagree,I disagree I think 3 is the best for PS. 1 just seems too old to me but go with your instincts.
1,Formating Failure,"I purchased the Apricorn EZ 60GB storage drive and it would not reformat. After I tried to reformat the unit, according to the instructions, my PC locked up and I had to remove it from the USB port. This problem continued so I contacted Apricorn support and their suggestion didn't work so I contacted them again but no reply. I guess Apricorn support only allows one question. I returned the unit to Amazon. From my experience I cannot recommend the Apricorn 60GB storage drive nor the support. This could certainly be an isolated case but the high price of the unit prevents me from trying it again."
5,Sensational Alex Harvey Band - Framed,A 70'S cult band from Scotland that was overlookedby the mainstream music world but who'smusic inspired the likes of AC/DC and Kiss but to namea few.This twin album set is a perfect introduction to SAHB whichshowcases thier diverse music style and laced with tongue in cheekhumor.The album has a version of Vambo called Vambo Marble Eye whichis not a good as Vambo but makes up for it with Midnight Moses and Framed.A great buy.
4,excellent,"With early 1970s Vertigo, you get a lot of progressive and jazz, but also a lot of straight rock. Thin Lizzy was one of the latter, and so was the Sensational Alex Harvey Band.This is preety much straight up, early '70s Stonsey rock, with a lot of brass and female singers. Great: this stuff actually reminds me of Exile On Main Street--blues chunk but with big arrangements and female singers.Alex Harvey is one of those lead singers who loved to play master of cerimonies, and he was very good at it. Not in the glam/Bowie/Alice Cooper sense, but with his high, loud voice, he sang with abaondon and loved every second of singing. There is a song here called ""Gang Bang""--don't worry, its early 1970s party fun for all, the girls idea, not a rape-done with banging panio and horns that could have been lifted from ""Tumblin' Dice."" It's as effective as rock.Excellent"
4,Button in Ear : The Steiff Encyclopedia,"This is an excellent overview of the history of the Steiff Co. Tons of pictures showing a vast history of stuffed animals and dolls. There is one doll that looks exactly like Homer Simpson. But also lots of information on how this privately owned company started, the methods and inventions for devising their creatures, pictures of the factory, the museum, dioramas, all amazing... In keeping with the Steiff profile the book also sports a heafty pricetag. Ahcht"
1,Save the world by printing lies on the disc cover?,"I truly wish I could rate it zero stars.The cover gives every indication that the main subject is beautiful aerial landscapes, when 80% or more is a completely unilateral, politically-biased talk-a-thon (talk-a-ton too) entirely FILMED FROM THE GROUND.To the filmmakers and producers: if you want to drive any agenda, start with being honest. Luring an audience by lying on the cover is wrong and weakens your message.To the potential buyer: avoid this like the devil - even if you side politically with the green agenda of the authors. Be green, and avoid liars!"
1,Disappointed,I totally agree with the review before mine. I purchased this box set for the spectacular aerial views of the earth as it promised. Nowhere on the box did it give the idea it's content was going to be so political. Most of the time is spent with dialog between angry French scientists with voice-overs or subtitles. Very disappointing...maybe someone will want this on eBay!
5,Marvelous Mandalas,"My 8 year old daughter has the Classic Mini Mandala set from Ravensburger. We have had it for about a year now and it is still a favorite! She says it makes really pretty mandalas and it is fun to do! She creates a stack of the mandalas and then staples the pages together to create her own coloring book... then she colors them later. So it is kind of a two for one--designing AND then coloring. It is VERY sturdy (it has been on several trips with us, as the ""mini"" size is very packable). It is a real steal for the price-- I will be buying ALL of the other designs (ocean, nature, romantic, etc.) --- they make GREAT gifts!"
1,Disappointing,"Arrived promptly, packaged well. This is not easy to use. Must be manually moved around - the designs for tracings are too small for normal pencils or gel pens. I would not purchase this product again. Very disappointing for the 7 year old child who received it as a Christmas present. Adults even complained of the complexity involved in use. Buy a spirograph, difficult to use but certainly easier than this Mini Mandala. I rated it a 4 for durability because it will last forever, impossible to use if you misplace the tiny pen it comes with."
1,Not what I expected,"Requires ""special size"" paper. that is very small. Npthing like what I expected, will give it to one of the grand kids to play with."
1,I could make a Higher Quality Version with scissors and a milk jug....,This product is an absolute joke. It literally looks like a small plastic box with a couple flimsy plastic stencils that someone cut from scraps out of the recycle bin. Don't waste your money.
5,United States to Great Britain: Shared Style,"This book takes the reader from the style of America in the early years of the 20th century to the life she created in Britain. Many aspects of style were shared in the two countries, but many are unique to each. It is interesting how Nancy Lancaster blended the two worlds into a grand country style that was appreciated by both. Her childhood home in Virginia was her inspiration throughout her life and helped set the style she was so well known for."
5,an english delight,"a magnificent mix of pictoral and narrative. as enthralling as a british mystery, you can't wait to pick it up and read and delight at the pictures."
3,Nancy Lancaster:English County House Style,Book was not what I expected. Book was recommended by a decorator who said Nancy Lancaster was her inspiration so I was expecting more decorating and less biography-like book. It does make an excellent coffee table presentation!!
2,Nancy Lancaster: English Country House,"Subject matter and book cover engaging... historically very interesting however pictorially, thoroughly disappointing...in fact a serious let down....."
5,Clifford's Kittens,The book I read is Clifford's Kitten.Clifford was so bad and he smashes the car. I liked this book.
2,NOT VERY INTERESTING,"My son is 3 years old and loves ""Clifford"" tv show. He didn't show much interest in this book and the story is short and boring. Also, I didn't realize the book would be flimsy like a coloring book (not a board book). I bought it because it got good reviews, but I'm not sure why."
4,A Fresh Look At Critical Thinking,"Elliot Cohen's latest book may be his best yet. In What Would Aristotle Do? Cohen once again lets the light of reason play on the shadowy side of our thinking. He well understands our twisted ways of inventing excuses for our conduct. His logic is sound, his experience wide-ranging. In simplest language, he shows what we can do if mental and emotional hang-ups are ruining our lives. If they are the kind that need only a bit of help from a reasonable philosopher/psychologist like Cohen himself, we should try this method of self-correction, and send those excuses and hang-ups packing!"
3,OK for requried reading,"This was required reading for a college course. Compared to the other 2 texts required for this class this one is the best, unfortunately its the shortest! Note, neither the college bookstore nor Amazon wants this back as trade-in."
4,Layman's Bible Book Commentary - Matthew,"I used this commentary, along with others, when participating in teaching an adult Sunday School class on Matthew. It was very helpful in developing greater depth."
1,This book is only a rant,"Alas, this book has proved to be only a diatribe against persons with whom Mr Morgan theologically disagrees. As a lifelong Hernisha pagan, I was prepared to enjoy myself as I sat down to read a book about Himself. Unfortunately, it turned out to be only a polemic against feminist pagans and assorted Christians. There is less than 5 pages here actually about pagan male deity in any form or concept, and even that is mostly presented in the negative as what the god is not rather than what He positively is. I cannot recommend this as useful or enlightening to anyone, unless you enjoy screeds."
2,What happened to this series?!?,"It takes alot for me to rate a book less than average. I've never skimmed a book before in my life, yet I did that very thing for the majority of this book.I was severely disappointed in this book mainly because I had grown to really love this series and the characters. At the end of book five with The Chairman & Lilith running rampant, I figured book 6 would be a slam dunk of non stop action and demon/vampire butt kicking. Instead, it was a 500 page mess of he said-she said, nothing but bickering between housemates and drama, drama, DRAMA!!!I really think L.A. Banks could've just eliminated 7/8's of this entire book out of the series and we wouldn't have missed any key elements. It wasn't until, literally, the last 30 pages that it was worth reading. I will pick up book 7 out of blind faith and hope for a better addition to the series, but after this monstrosity, I'm not holding my breath."
4,LOVING THIS SERIES!!!,"Chaos abounds in the latest in the fabulous L.A. Banks vampire huntress series. The portals of hell have been opened...and the result are demons walking Earth, resulting in murderous behavior of the most heinous kind. The Damned, released by Lilith, are spreading their infection simply by touch. Even the Guardians are affected, albeit to a lesser degree; the ""thrill is gone"" from Damali and Carlos's relationship, and the tension rises when Damali finds herself thinking of Jose in the physical sense, and there is serious distrust throughout the Guardian team...especially between the Neterus. In order to stop the pandemic, the Guardians must find and behead both Lilith and the Chairman...and Carlos must retrieve the Book of the Damned and return it to the Light....before souls everywhere, including Guardian souls, are lost forever.Never one to disappoint, Banks has delivered another winner in her series....anxiously awaiting The Forsaken."
4,LA BANKS rules!,"this one is superb, as is all of LA BANKS writings. For a long series, this one rocks! Once you have read them all you will agree."
3,Banks is starting to fizzle,"This book would've been great if Banks had just stuck to the action and conflicts. Too much time is spent discussing philosophy, religion, love, history, etc., and the discussions aren't that enlightening or phenomenal. Actually, a lot of it's just plain annoying and repetitive.The great moments in the book are few and far between. Maybe if I hadn't read all of the previous books, and didn't know what this author's capable of (have you read The Bitten, wow!!), I'd be less disappointed.Read it if you've already grown addicted to the series and the characters. There are a few moments that are great."
2,Another great read,"I continue to rave about Banks's Vampire Huntress Legends. The Damned is equally exciting and moving. The in-depth look into all the characters continues the saga. She's like a juggler keeping all the balls in the air, and not dropping a one. This book is a bit deeper in that Carlos returns to his bad-boy-self, giving a brief break to his move into ""The Light."" She allowed human nature to remain center stage saying, in essence, that we are not all good. I hope Banks continues to keep Carlos's duel personality in the mix. She hints that the female and male Neteru are going to really come together in the next book. I can barely wait for ""The Forsaken.""Amazon's rating scale is wrong. I rate this book a 5 star."
1,Ghetto Talk,"Maybe I am too old for this book, granted, I didn't read the first in the series, and apparently, this is one of those series where you need to read them in consecutive order, but I can't get past page 30. I must be too old, I need a dictionary to understand all the ghetto talk, I spend more time translating the ghetto talk to older person talk to really get into the book. I guess I am not the 20-something that this series is aimed at. I am wondering if it was written in modern English if I could read more of it, even if I haven't read the previous installments in the series."
5,Five Stars Isn't Enough !!!!!!!,"I just finished ""The Damned ""and it was most definitly worth the wait. Carlos & Damali are the ultimate soulmates....I also would like to say to Ms. Banks much love to ya lady, it was pleasure to meet you at the booksigning on 1-31-06.I would like to comment for those who couldn't get into the book,...THIS SERIES IS NOT FOR YOU !!!I also would like to add my 75 cent opinion, first off ..livingin the type of world that man has so cruely defiled.I for one am absolutly grateful that Ms. Banks brought philosophy, religion and history to this VHL series particularly 'The Damned'.I'm most certain all of Ms. Banks fans would agree..( smile )Everyone is entitled to free speech, COME ON PEOPLE!!! we could never ever get enough of history and religion wouldn't you say?KNOWLEDGE IS POWER !! no matter how we get it, be it fictionalbooks, movies , word of mouth etc...Keep Up The Good Work Leslie Banks looking forward to reading'The Forsaken'.."
3,"Too much romance, not enough action","First I must say that I am enjoying the series overrall. I just wish there were more pages of action than romance. I find myself skipping the romance/sex scene because they are uninteresting and redundant. They don't add to or advance the story line. We already know that Damali and Carlos are soul mates, etc. The author spends so much time on the uninteresting, long, drawn out love scenes that by the time the action occurs, it is almost anti-climatic."
3,"Attractive, and convinient MP3 CD Player....for a while","I recieved this product as a present a few months ago. When i first got it it worked perfectly, it was easy to use, and it was very attractive. Now a few months later it seems to have stopped working.Whenever I try to play a CD it tries to read it and then says NO DISC, when the disc reads fine on other CD players. You can try buying this MP3 CD PLayer, because if it continues to work it'll be great, but it might turn out like mine, broken in a couple months"
1,D.O.A.,I have purchased 2 of these units so far (07/31/03 & 08/04/03). Both were non-functional upon arrival. I am returning the second one and have given up on this unit. Buyer beware.
3,take another look,"was looking for a mp3 cd player when i did some research. I would have gone with Aiwa (which is a GREAT brand, very good quality and value. Not very big in the U.S. however.) iriver sounds like a great product in terms of features but the quality is atrocious. I dont actually own a unit but iv had friends advise me on playing it safe and getting a sony. I ordered the Sony D-NE10. It is somewhat more expensive but better in many ways. So take another look at other products before u settle for a iRiver."
2,Busted,"I received my IMP 550 today. Put an MP3 cd into and press play on the remote, nothing happen. Thinking it might be a bad cd, replace it with a different cd. Still nothing! Tried a music cd no better. The only message appearing on the LCD ""No Disk"".As you can imagine I am very anooyed that this should happen.I will be sending it back to Amazon in US. The only problem now is that I live in Ireland and Amazon in US don't sell outside of US and Canada. I used a friends address in the US who then bought it with him when he came to Ireland."
5,very good,"this player is very good. Perfect sound compared to Sony, Panasonic, RCA (have my word of a audiophile). Easy to use. Small. Compact. Even if you plug in bigger speakers if sounds great. Battery life is as noted in the description. Also good for audio books. It is good that you can use it in your car as well and in this way you don't have to worry about leaving your car with an expensive car audio (this one you can easily carry with you). I highly recommend it - this is the Cadillac of all portable cd players."
2,Pretty looks but not good quality,"The player looks nice, I grant. But now after only 6 months of occasional use I can only get 30 minutes of play out of my batteries. Well just return them under the one year warranty right. No, the warranty on batteries is only 90 days. So the player that plays 50 hours on batteries now plays for 30 minutes. By the way new batteries cost $20 from I-River and mine never played anything for 50 hours. I expected better from a $150 cd player. My recommendation: Buy something cheaper so you're not broke when it breaks."
2,Very bad radio,"The radio is worthless!!! It is only possible to listen to the strongest radiostations, when you are standing still and holding up the earphone cable. Tried it at the absolute center of Stockholm (the capital of Sweden), and could bearly hear anything.Furthermore, putting the mp3 on takes about 45 seconds and a usual audio-cd takes about 20-30 seconds....so I returned the player to the store and, with some hesitation, bought the iRiver SlimX 400 in stead. I became very positively surprised! The radio is very good on SlimX 400, I can use it almost anywhere, maybe not in the subway but rather far down the stairs to the subway. However, the batteries only last for 5-10 hours, but I can anyway strongly recommend SlimX 400."
3,False MSRP,"Hey, if you want it, you want it! In fact, I just bought one. But, you might like to know that the MSRP on the manufacturer's very own website is $149.99. NOT the $179.99 claimed here on this Amazon page. Check it out for yourself. http://www.iriveramerica.com/products/iMP-550.aspx"
1,"Bought 2, both defective!! Never again IRiver!!","In late Feb and early March 2004, I was shipped two consecutive units which were both defective. I saw another message where one person bought 3 and all were defective. I'm not going to be a sucker for a third round."
5,It is just great,"This thing is awsome, the amount of options you can set on it is amazing. I mean you could just sit ther for hours tweaking everything. The sound quality is great. I mean for the money i think this is the best out there. Just go ahead and get it you know you want to."
1,Not a good choice,"This Cd player is not slim at all, when compared to slim offerings from Sony and Panasonic. The case design is also very ugly. It's not just generic, which would have been fine, but ugly. It's at best average as a CD player. It can play MP3 files, but I'd recommend a dedicated MP3 player like the iPod or the Rio products, because they give you more control over playback. The user interface on this thing is depressingly confusing, and some of my CDs and CD-Rs which play fine on Panasonic had trouble playing on this. Not recommended, unless you want to pay $150 for a low-quality FM radio."
3,A dubious start,"I received this sleek little player today, complete with all the accessories and features I could hope for! But apparently, I expected too much. After six hours, the rechargeable batteries haven't taken a charge. And I've followed ALL the instructions in my manual and on Iriver's technical support page, several times."
2,Very bad radio!!!!!!!!!,"The radio is worthless!!! It is only possible to listen to thestrongest radiostations, when you are standing still and holding up the earphone cable. Tried it at the absolute center of Stockholm (the capital of Sweden), and could bearly hear anything.Furthermore, putting the mp3 on takes about 45 seconds and a usual audio-cd takes about 20-30 seconds....so I returned the player to the store and, with some hesitation, bought the iRiver SlimX 400 in stead. I became very positively surprised! The radio in iRiver 400 is very good, I can use it almost anywhere, maybe not in the subway but rather far down the stairs to the subway.However, the batteries only last for 5-10 hours, but I can anywaystrongly recommend SlimX 400."
4,Excellent Customer Service,"I decided on the 550 over the $99 model because I heard that it has less ""gap"" in between mp3 tracks. I listen to a lot of mixes that are spilt into tracks and having a 2 second gap is annoying. When I got the player, the AC adatpter did not work, which meant I couldnt recharge the batteries. I called the Customer Support line and with no hassle or delay at all they sent out a replacement adapter that arrived in about 5 days. Awesome! This is a great player but be warned, the remote is smaller than you think and feels fragile. Unless you absolutely need the car kit, go for the $99 model. It's strange, in a package filled with high quality accessories, the earbuds are simply awful. But who ever uses the included ones anyways? Don't even consider any brand other than iRiver.."
1,horrible,"This player is horrible, it takes forever for it to switch between CD and radio, keeps freezing up on you so you have to take out and put in batteries. keeps skipping all the time, definitely not made for jogging or sports. UGH...so annoying!!"
2,"Good sound quality, but no stability","I have the player for about half a year now.From the start our relationship wasn't very jolly - while charging the batteries for the first time the player was getting really heated so that basically if I left it charging for an hour more, it probably would've internally burned itself.But fortunately nothing happened and I kept using it.Couple months later, the remote control just died on me without any warning. Since I have the warranty, the company replaced it, but what will I do when it expires? Seems I'm not the first one getting bad parts.Overall -Pros:-Good sound quality and sound options-Can be updated with the newest file types-Looks pretty good-Many options, although most are unnecessary (Beep volume, Fade in etc)Cons:-Skips all the time!!!-Pricey for what it is-Charging is a nightmare-Takes a while to load-Noisy"
5,The Best CD player money can buy,"If your looking for the best Mp3 cd player that money can buy, you have found it. Iriver has done a great job with the 550. The unit is extremely small and light. Some say that the remote is hard to use, but it really isnt. After playing around with it for 5 mins you will figure how to use it.The sound is also great, I never thought music could sound so great. At first i was going to buy the iriver ihp-120, but then i thought again should i spent 400 or should i go with the 550 that is more than half the price. I decided to go with the 550 and im extremely happy with my decision"
3,M.A.R. Barker continues his fantasy series set on Tekumel,This is one of three paperback sequels to the DAW book Man of Gold 1980s paperback.Of the three I felt this was the weakest. While as engrossing as the other two (reviewed also) I found this story line slightly dreary with a weaker ending. Still recommended for Tekumel buffs as part of Professor Barkers fascinating imaginary world.
5,The GM Motorama: Dream Cars of the Fifties.,A really great book covering possibly the best auto era from the greatest ever auto company.I'll be buying more copies for auto fan friends.
3,It will serve it's intended purpose.,"I have to laugh at the other reviews that state this item is 2-5 pounds and it's 1:1 scale. It's probably half the size of an actual AK, and it weighs probably a pound. It's all plastic and decently detailed. It will be used for a halloween costume so it's not bad for having to pay 15 bucks for it. I'd have to say that it is a little overpriced for what you get. It's worth $7 if you're lucky."
3,A to the K,It's an okay toy. The trigger did not last very long. My son and I played war a couple of times and the trigger stopped working. I had to use a rubber band to make it go back to its normal spot.
3,Could be better,For starters this is a great collections. You get all of the Ozzy Era Black Sabbath albums for a great price. The Albums are Re-Mastered and come on DigiPack cases that mimic the old Vinyl Sleeves the records would have come in. The problem is I have gone through two copies of this box set. The Cds are very cheaply made. I would have given this box set a 5 star rating but the crappy quality of the Cds took away two stars. You are either better off buying the albums separately or burning the music to you computer then making copies/Syncing to you Mp3 player. Maybe this is obvious but still the Cds are poor quality because I for one still like Cds even though they have become almost obsolete.
2,"Great band, poor product.","My friend bought this and has shown me the results. I think it is just another way of sucking more money from commited Sabbath fans who will buy anything. There are some rare photos, including pictures of another band altogether!If you are a audiophile with good sound equipment you might be able to hear something new, but if like me you haven't, then you won't be able to tell any difference between this and the other 'remastered' disks available.The package is cheap, the digi pack release a while back are a much better package. A sabbath tour is imminent and the objective here is clear. The book on it's own would be worth 10 - $15.If you han't got the 'Ozzy' era Sabbath, this is a good start, other than that it's a rip-off (IMHO)."
4,Better value than iTunes and MP3s,"I've been hoping for a Black Sabbath ""give in"" to sell their catalog digitally so I could conveniently purchase digitally, but could not complete my iPOD collection without Black Sabbath, so I ""gave in"", and bought the box set. This purchase reminded me of the beauty of good old fashioned CDs with covers, artwork, lyrics and all! Much happier with the physical box set than the digital would-be set. The book that comes with the set made it worth it alone, plus the DRM freedom i want. This is a better value than I would expect from a future digital box set."
5,Created for the true original Black Sabbath fan,"This box set is the remastered version of the original, with Ozzie, Black Sabbath albums. The sound quality is excellent. It comes in a very cool black box with a dvd of some vintage Sabbath live concert tunes. This is a must have for any Sabbath fan."
5,Black Sabbath - Black Box Set - Best Remastered Collection!,"Up till recently, INMOP the 1996 Castle import remasters series was the collection to have for the classic Ozzy era, but now the Warner Bros. collection is simply the best! From Black Sabbath to Never Say Die, each Lp sounds absolutely fantastic with great highs, lows, and everything in between like no others! Sabbath fans, look no further! Go out and get this stellar remastered collection ASAP!"
3,overpriced for what you get,Way too much $$ for what you get.They should have added songs for what it sells for.I passed on it when I saw the price.
5,Awesome!,"Sabbath fan since '78.Just received this collection 2 days ago...and let me tell you the audio KICKS! I can't tell you how good it is to hear all of my favorite Sabbath tunes again and trust me, the collection is well-worth every penny just for the audio! Highly recommended!"
5,Finally!!,"As a Black Sabbath fan for over twenty years, and an owner of all the tapes from Black Sabbath to Never Say Die, let me say I am quite pleased with this set! The book is great, with a load of info. This set is well done, looks good, and will remain in my CD changer for quite a while!!"
5,This is THE REAL Sabbath,"As I said Sabbath died after they kicked Ozzy out, except for the Heaven & Hell and Dehumanizer albums (Dio). These discs are remastered and come in thin fold cases (I would have liked the real box). The remastering sounds fabulous; I originally had Vol. 4 Master of Reality and Paranoid which sounded okay but these copies blew them away! I highly recommend this for Sabbath, Ozzy, or metal fans."
3,First CD Is Great But The Other CDs Need Better Remastering,"I own this box set of Black Sabbath cds. The first self titled cd by Black Sabbath is the best of all 8 cds from this package. It is remasterd great and plays loud. But the other 7 cds come up short. The other 7 cds only play half as loud compared to the self titled release. It's like after doing a great job remastering the first cd, whoever remastered the other cds stop caring about the remastering quality or just didn't care about the other Black Sabbath cds. The japanese remastered import cds of the other 7 Black Sabbath, I own them too, are slightly better than the american releases. Overall there is no excuse for crappy remastering when there is 24 bit remastering available. Great Black Sabbath cds but hopefully in the future there will be 24 bit remastered Black Sabbath cds with better remastering."
5,what else can I write?,"It is the most incredible CD set that I ever owned... I rather like to use ""awarded"" this item... 10000% nice"
5,the ozzy years,"all ozzy/sabbath cd's in one package. all cd's sound crystal clear.remember these masters date back to 1969(30years),so even with remastering they are not gonna sound like they were recorded last week.they should thrown in the 2 studio cuts off of the reunion live cd too."
5,Awesome Reissues!,I have been listening to Sabbath since the mid-70s.I have all the vinyl which rules by the way.I also bought a couple of the Warner releases in the early 90s which sounds very muffled and the 96 Castle remasters which sound great.But this box set tops them all.I play music by ear cause i have a great ear for sound and anyone that says they can't tell the difference between the Warner releases and this set must have a hearing problem and i am not being a smart butt either.These remasters are incredible very warm and rich.I love the way these sound.See for yourself the positive reviews outweigh the negative by far.BUY THIS!!
1,springboard,This charger does not charge the spring board.. Don't bother to try. It may work for other tablets but not the Springboard.
5,BEST OF THE PS1 TEKKEN SERIES,"Though this review may be 14 years 2 late,n my opinion TK2 is the best of the PS1 Tekken games.From the cool fmv intro 2 the ending credits TK2 is by far the best looking/sounding 3D fighting game on the ps1 console.TK3 backgrounds,music,fmv cinemas,light source shading,animations/combos just does'nt measure 2 the standards set by this 1996 classic and it was release 2 years later,go figure!"
5,Tekken 2 is a brilliant one player and multi player game,Tekken 2 came in as a brilliant sequal and is a exciting gameto play. the game has no bad sides but tekken 3 some how was anamazing sequal END
4,The best Tekken on PSX,"Tekken 2, is not that much different from your typical fighting game. There are plently of extra character, and beating the game with different characters gets you cool FMV's.Still, sometimes the enemy can get too tough, but the battle graphics are good, and there are plenty of different modes, and attacks to keep anyone busy for awhile."
4,Tekken 2 works for me!,"Tekken 2 is so cool. My favorite people are Paul and Jack-2. Paul has an awesome elbow-hit-punch, but the best thing is when Jack-2...does this pro-wrestling pick you up, throw you down move. Law is the real choice for speed, but for power, Jack-2 or Paul. The gals on this game are fast! The best one is probably Nina. I wish Tekken 2 was like PC games where you can load people from newer games to older ones, because Gun Jack from Tekken 3 is so cool. He can shoot people with his gloves. That's my only complaint."
3,Difficult! But a decent game,I bought this because i enjoy fighting games. But the controls are so hard. If it used analog control it would be a lot easier. But overall its an o.k game!
5,Nostalgia Galore!,It is so great to be playing this game again. I remember playing this when I was a kid. So many good times with this game!
3,Dr Lam Tai Chi,"As a fan of Tai Chi and student of several years I have Dr Lam's book DVD's of great help in studying this subject, I fully endorse this author's products, they are detailed, clear and easy understood and followed, I was delighted to find I could purchase these items from Amazon at a price affordable to all.Joan Lawson"
1,"Love Dr Lam's work, but no samples available","I highly admire the work of Dr. Paul Lam through Tai Chi, but was extremely disappointed that the review says you CAN listen to a sample, yet no samples are available.Would you be able to correct this error, please?"
4,Beautiful,"Very nice music for practicing my Tai Chi. I downloaded it to my phone, so I use headphones and do my practices. I also get anxious sometimes when I am shopping or driving and I noticed it really helps to listen if I feel nervous, relaxing and explorative at the same time!"
4,Exceeds expectations!,"The analog picture for the typical channels was far better than I expected and the digital picture is VERY sharp. I had no idea what I was missing with my CRT television! Menu for adjustments is simple and you can see the results as you adjust - Nice. I didn't go over it with a fine tooth comb, but I have found no dead pixels after the month+ that I've owned it.Front loading DVD that plays various music formats is a great feature that I got specifically for my blind wife and the 'Eject' button on the remote is a bonus - No fingerpints from hunting for an eject button on the front/side of the TV. The DVD layout means this unit is not as slim as many other TVs out there, so be aware.Overall remote layout was good, but the buttons are small. Sound quality is good & there's plenty of volume.I was expecting a good TV with some compromises because of the extra features and competative pricing - This one exceeded my expectations and I have NO regrets."
4,A good fit!,This TV had to fit in a small space. We got a nice size screen for the small outside dimension. The built-in DVD really helps with the tight fit. It has a great picture and a good arrangement for hook-up. We really are happy with it.
1,Ripped off...,"I spent a few hundred dollars for a television that worked for 8 months. But then, maybe it's my fault. First of all, I should have questioned why a 32"" LCD TV was selling for so much less than those of leading brands such as Sony, Samsung, etc. Second, I should have thought twice about a television that comes with only a 90-day warranty. And third, I should have done more thorough research before buying--perhaps I'd have realized how many people have been disappointed by Westinghouse televisions.I now have a TV with almost no picture that I'll try to give away. After reading all the horror stories here and elsewhere, I won't bother trying to deal with Westinghouse customer service.""Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice....can't fool me twice."""
1,Never buy Westinghouse- horrible customer service,"We purchased this Westinghouse TV and the picture was poor. We called Westinghouse and were told we had to ship it back to the company ($70) and when they received the TV they would send out a NEW TV. When the replacement TV came it was a refurbished TV and had lots of dents and scratches. We called again and they told us the wrong TV was shipped, so we sent back the dented TV. The next replacement was worse - Huge scratch on screen. After fighting over this, many phone calls and 4 moths without a TV we received the final replacement TV that is also a REFURBISHED TV and a large white spot in the center of the picture. We called again and they said they won't do anything about it. So not only did we pay the price of a new TV and have a REFURBISHED one, it has a white spot in the center."
3,stands alone,"This title is not included in the Ella Clah series. As such I found it very interesting and informative. Not only does the author tell about medicinal plants and their uses,she reveals more about tribal hierarchy. Ella appears in the book but only plays the part of a worried loved one,the same as Rose appears in the Ella Clah books."
2,Not a Navajo voice int the bunch,"The story is generally carried along by short conversations. but the voices do not change. I had to see who said or replied to know who was speaking. In good writing each character carries their own voice through the novel - that is how we get to know them. This does not happen here. The only interesting part is the knowledge about medicine herbs. I guess if one has never read a novel about Native Americans, either modernists or traditionalists, or better yet gotten to know a few, this might be a good start. But every culture carries its own language and thought patterns and to capture that is the trick of good writers. Hillerman of course comes to mind (as does Faulkner with an entirely different kind of ""unbeknown"" culture) - we know who each character is just by the way they phrase things."
3,deeply disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Aimee and David Thurlo, but ""Plant Them Deep"" was deeply disappointing. It was lo-o-o-ng on botanical info and short on mystery. I was determined to see it through to the end. And I will admit that the ending was the best part. Please don't let this review deter you from reading any of the Ella Clah mysteries. They are worth the read."
5,A++,"I heard abou Eric when we came to Seattle for a tour at the local GLBT center in promotion of his new album ""All For Show"". I was very impressed and glad to meet the man that has made this wopnderful music. He sounds like a solid contender for upcoming artist and rivals all the Dave Mathews and John Mayer. He definitly has a Tracy Chapman influence. Trust me if you get this album you will not be disapointed."
1,Big disappointment,"I bought this and 2 other of Eric Himan CD's (All FOr Show & One Night Stands... Eric Himan Live) after reading other customer reviews and listening to a few 30 second clips...BIG MISTAKE. These are just 3 more CD's that will collect dust that I bought on reading the advise of others.I had expected something more polished than a coffee house folk singer. I could not relate to most of his songs after attempting to connect with them after a second and third listen. Some of the songs were just plain difficult to understand with Himan's style of singing. This will appeal to you if you are into coffe shop performers and are not really listening to the words but unfortunately not me.If you are looking for out performers that are more polished, easier to understand and can relate to better because of his words check out Levi Kreis at his website levikreis.com or cdbaby.com, his music was not available at Amazon at least check."
3,enlightening but not entertaining,"If you are looking for a happy ending this one is not for you. No winners. It was interesting and caused me to search Google, however this is not a movie I will talk about with others let alone reccommend to others."
3,Ok If you've moved through more exciting movies in your queue,The movie starts out at a good pace but slows down pretty rapidly after that. Never seems to fully develop.
2,Slow with not a lot of plot.,"I can't relate to those who love this movie, could have told the same story in half the time. Never really felt anything for the characters."
2,Too drawn out,"While the film had an interesting premise and was well acted, there just wasn't enough material to fill out a 90 minute movie. This is probably why the filmmakers used endless repetition to draw out what should have been a 45 minute short into a feature length film.If you choose to watch it, I recommend viewing the film up to the point where it reaches the present day at 23:00. Then skip to 39:00 and watch to 53:10. Skip again to 58:00 and watch to the end.You will still see plenty of repetitious and unneeded material. But you will get everything you need out of the film, and have 20 minutes of your life back."
1,terrible,I kept waiting for this movie to get better but it never did. It has to be the most boring movie ive seen. Don't. Waste your time
1,Five minutes of Heaven,Five minutes of heaven???? No! 90 minutes of hell! My wife knows how to pick such great movies.... buzz kill TV at its finest!
5,Excellent!,A very well made movie with great acting from a fine cast. James Nesbit in particular is on top form.
5,Very realistic depiction,"This movie is fantastic. Really depicts the raw feelings, fear, and anger that a man can feel towards another man for what he has done to him. Likewise, it shows what the guilty man goes through all of his life, trying to forget the horrible, undo-able act that he has committed in his past. Both Liam Neeson and James Nesbitt played superbly and gave a realistic reenactment of these events."
3,"Good acting, good production... Slow-moving","Liam Neeson and James Nisbitt both deliver great performances in this film. The beginning is really interesting, but then the movie kind of lulls along. It seems to me that the director decided to drag out some scenes to elongate the film. There really isn't much that occurs in terms of plot, which is likely why the director feels the need to have such long scenes. The movie is entertaining to an extent, but fell a bit short of my expectations. If you're a sucker for good acting, or a fan of either of these actors, the film is probably worth your time. If you have more of the contemporary, instant-gratification mindset, you'll be bored after about 25 minutes."
1,terrible show,"had to turn it off, couldn't watch anymore of it.This is possibly the worst show I have ever seen, yuk"
3,Not one of his best,"Love Liam Neeson, but this to me wasn't one of his best movies & I make a point to see all of his movies."
3,its ok,Its ok Its definetely not a blockbuster story and film... but the story falls short with the ending leaving a bitter taste to such a tasteful start
4,Well crafted screenplay- extraordinary,"This films has a great independent feel, plus the bonus of unexpected plot twists.The psychological reactions in the film are incredibly realistic. It is refreshing to seeLiam Neesan in a film that is not over the top with violence and action. Even though it isreal to life- it is still very suspenseful."
1,Didn't finish watching it,"I couldn't get past the first five minutes. Didn't capture me and listening to the f word more times than I could count within the first minute, didn't have a desire to watch any more of it."
2,Too Dark and Bloody,"I realize that this was a very dark period in Ireland's history, but this film is way gritty and dark. Heavy fare."
4,Interesting Story.,"Very interesting story.....a little hard to follow at times, but when there was something that was not immediately clear - later in the story it did answer/explain what I had not understood or followed."
3,Heaven?,Dragged out and not very exciting....Liam deserves better works to show he immense talent. Kind of a waste of talent.
4,sad but beautiful,"Excellent screenplay. Beautifully filmed. Not sure why this was described as a ""political thriller."" There was definately a political aspect to the film, but not a thriller aspect. Nevertheless, the character development was superb and the film was very moving."
3,Personal interest deternines movie's strength.,Greatly appreciate the purpose of the movie. I loved it; husband went to bed early. Depends on interest in Liam Neeson and/or interest in Irish/Bristish conflicts.
3,Thematic Content: Superb & Story: Inadequate,"If the overall discourse is concerning how religious intolerance provokes violence (e.g. Protestant-Catholic; Sunni-Shi'a; Christian-Muslim; Christian-Jew; Jew-Muslim; Hindi-Muslimi; Muslim-Buddhist; zealot-atheist) then this movie is an ignitor for such a discussion. If the discourse is personal revenge then the movie has some notable inadequacies. To carry an actable revengeful hatred for thirty years is not likely - five years, possibly, and that is a stretch. For a mother to heap the burden of guilt onto an eleven year old is also not likely. That this story unfolded with the characters being so storybook likable is also unlikely."
2,Disappointed,"Since recently discovering Liam Neeson as an actor in the movie Taken, I was expecting so much more. I was disappointed! The movie was slow and boring."
2,BORING,"Ten minutes was enough. Then I tossed it out the window. Well, not really. Heh.The beginning was too slow and it didn't go anywhere. MY GRADE: C minus."
1,Not good!,I don't really even know what this movie was about. It is the boringest movie I have seen since Meet Joe Black!
1,half hour of boring,Couldn't even get past the first half hour - what?? zzzzz :[ not a girl movie. good movie if you can't sleep at night.
2,boring,"liam neeson is just a boring non interesting actor, i dont understand how he made it. he cant carry any movie he's been in. If it weren't for James Nesbitt this would be a total wash."
5,Awesome movie,"I loved this movie! The two actors were great and their emotions were convincing. You really feel for them. They should have hired these actors for the Sandy Hook performance, which wasn't convincing at all! Anyway... I'm very particular about movies and this one was well worth the time spent. The accents were a little hard to understand at the beginning of the movie and I found I couldn't understand what they were saying sometimes, but I'm glad I stuck with it and watched the movie throughout. So sad that the Irish kill each other. I feel for both sides. It's heartbreaking for sure. The Irish are a beautiful people but youth can do foolish things and this movie has a great message about that. I'm glad it ended well and both men found their peace. I don't want to give anything away but I would recommend anyone to watch the movie."
4,A well done drama about a tought subject.,"Not going to be everyone's cup of tea because of slow pace and tough, very rapid accented dialogue, at times but worth a look for those that like foreign films and the cinema arts theater films. Not a giant film but one that does a decent job of a tough topic. Recommended."
5,five minutes of heaven,"Have always enjoyed Liam Neeson's acting,and this one did not disappoint. Is a hard subject to cover, but it was handled well.story did not drift off,though i do wish the ending was not so abrupt as it was,that is my only complaint. 5 stars"
4,Insight,I thought that was a very good movie. I feel like I have a little insight into a part of life I've luckily not had to experience.
3,Outstanding but Biased,"Would have been a great movie if it weren't for the stereotyping of the Catholics and the Protestants. What's that you say? Yes, it's biased. Quite obviously. The Catholic family is portrayed as the maladjusted, uneducated, irascible group, and the Protestants as successful, well adjusted, and capable. The only Catholics we're introduced to in the story are the mother and son, and they're both rough, salt-of-the-earth sorts, with limited capacities. We don't meet anyone else that fits in and levels the field on the Catholic side. We do get to see a number of other Protestant people. So the view is a bit slanted. It could do with a better presentation of the Catholic people instead of presenting just the poor image stereotypes. I find that quite sad in this day and age. So the fact that it's a great story with great acting is watered down by the prejudicial treatment of the subject matter."
4,Interesting Earlier Work of Liam Neeson,"As good as Neeson was, his opposite character actor was even better. Very good look at the damage done to a family during and after the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland.There could have been more depth to the story, but it would've been bogged down, so it plays out pretty well and is recommended if the the subject type interests you."
3,Not what I expected,"Based on the awards it won, etc., I was expecting a far different and better movie.I would have rated it two stars, but part of my problem was difficulty understanding some of the dialog because of the Irish accents, so I'm trying not to penalize it for that. But, it was very slow and ponderous and I had difficulty maintaining my interest.The only reason I watched the entire movie is that my wife and I are HUGE Liam Neeson fans.Unless you're a big Liam Neeson fan, or really into the Irish culture and history, you may not enjoy this movie as much as you think you will."
4,A little hard to translate at times,"It had a drawn out , and confusing at times beginning, but ended with a very outstanding demonstration of issues and times in lands far from our own that can help a lot of us see many issues that haunt us in our lives within our inner cities."
3,focus and follow,Very deep inside look on how a person can reconcile their life. Would like to know how the others fared.
2,Slow!!,"Slow movie, wierd way!, no plot!did not touch me, I fell asleep.....long movie, they are very good actors for make this very bad movie."
2,Slow slow movie,"Movie starts over in Ireland with fighting and shooting. The movie is confusing, doesn't explain why a young man was killed."
1,Wish I could get my 90 minutes back,It was so boring I don't know why I watched the whole thing. Guess I was hoping something good would finally happen. It didn't. What a waste of 90 minutes of my life.
1,When Will These Copywriter People Stop Being So Inept?,"This is not a review of the film or the blu-ray - this is a review of the package copy: It blatantly states that this is from the Oscar-nominated director of Downfall. Um, no. Fire the copywriter, because while Downfall was nominated for Best Foreign Film its director was most certainly not nominated for an Oscar. It's shocking what these people think they can get away with. Sell the movie on its own merits, don't make up stuff."
1,What review,The accents are just terrible. What about subtitles for some who cannot understand gibberish english. The movie may be OK but very difficult to follow.
4,A Different Role for Liam Neeson,"For those used to seeing Liam Neeson in tough-guy action hero roles, this will be a real departure. It asks the question: how does a society put itself back together after civil war?This is a story about guilt, grief, and redemption set in Northern Ireland, as the country tries to get some kind of closure after the horrific events of the ""Troubles"" in Belfast in the 1970s.Liam Neeson is a guilt-ridden character who committed a political killing as a teenager to curry favor with the extremists whom he admired. James Nesbitt plays the tortured brother of his victim. The two are to be brought together on a television program to meet for the first time.Not a lot of action, but an absorbing, thought-provoking film nonetheless. Excellent performances by the two principal actors."
3,Not bad,"This game is meant to be played on windows xp or 2000 but I have played it on my computer with windows vista and it mostly works... you can still play around like steal cars and drive around town and stuff but some of the controls that are set to this game are not compatible with windows vista. For example: mission 10, titled ""cesar vailpando"" is a mission where you are at a tournament driving a lowrider hotrod and you are trying to make your car move up and down by using the controls, the controls that are required to beat this mission are either not compatible or not available for windows vista or windows 7. So if you want to beat this game, I would recommend buying either an older computer with windows xp or buying a playstation 2 because you will not be able to beat this mission if you have windows vista or newer."
1,Windows xp or lower,i just try it today and the game dosent work. the game supports windows xp and lower witch really sucks. so if you paln to buy this buy gta iv for pc or for this one for ps2. SAVE SOME TIME
4,Cheap fun,not the best game in the world and barely comparable to the quality of the newer GTAs. Still the story is interesting and keeps you entertained.
3,Intensive Violence,"I love to play xbox 360 games, so it has a incredible graphics and animations, just the only negative thing, is about it has extreme violence for the Teenagers...carefull. just."
5,"March 6, 2006 below has it all backwards","The version (2.0) has been altered to 'remove' the ability to 'hot coffee' mod the program.This version (2.0), while still containing the violence, language, and sexual references was altered to remove the ability to de-clothe' the characters within the game.The original release could be altered.The version (2.0) was released due to a small public outcry about the nudity. AND a few 'activities' that are going on while in the 'nude'.....Strange when you can remember the reasons why they tried to ban Grand Theft Auto 3 all those years ago.This time around they don't even mention violence.They are mad now because kids can see people 'nekkid'.;-)"
5,works ok with vista,"great game. bought this during spring break and have been playing for non stop for a week. It works well with vista, although it crashes from time to time when I exist to view the map or when i jump to the desktop by using alt+tab. But no serious issues."
5,real fun. reaaally fun!,"This game is really fun and i love it. You can do basically anything you want including crimes of course, but watch out for the police. I recommend this game to anyone who does not care for profanity or gang violence. Get this game if you want some fun."
1,grand theft auto san andreas,"I couldn't get the game to download on mine or my son's computer. I'm sure no fault of the seller, shipping was fast. My son is disappointed he can not play the game on his PC but he already has the Playstation 2 version."
2,Lack Luster,Its the same as Vice City.Alot of bugs and glitches and very repetitive. Just get GTAIV.
2,A BIG STEP BACKWARD FROM VICE CITY,"GTA VICE CITY Was great.San Andreas was a big let down for me.I expect games in a series to get better not worse.This one is not even near as good as vice city.It is more like GTA 3.It is selling in the stores now for $15.00 which is to high.It is selling used on Amazon at this time for $12.00 which is still to high especially for it used.I purchased it new awhile back for $20.00,played it for a couple of hours.Decided it sucked and sold it it on Amazon for $14.50 and that was the HOT COFFEE version."
4,What a game..!,This is awesome.. Can't put it down. I have played liberty city but loved this more. Shipping and packing was smooth. Nothing to complain.. Definitely must but for someone who likes the GTA series.
4,White funk comes of age,"Zuba, hailing from the rocky mountains near Boulder, CO managed to capture the energy of their trademark live shows on this one."
4,(somewhat) Catching up to Visual Basic......,"REALBasic is great Programming software, so at least some projects. If you are working on a project that requires you to compile the application for Windows, Mac and Linux, this is the Programming Software to use. I enjoy REALBasic because of the compiling feature I stated above, the small compiled file it produces (that even does not even require a runtime!) and the power that it holds. However, for some projects, Visual Basic is the way to go."
3,Have you ever tried to program in Real Basic?,"To call it a basic at all is to misname it.I , now, use it everydayand I can tell you it is a language one loves to hate.The hardest thing is to figure what is ""global"" and what is local.Or how to get it to recognize it's own [stuff]...or add new stuff that isn't ""standard"".I can tell you that it is the only language that has made me afraid to try something becauce of how bad it crashes my machine.It has made me feel sorry for my poor Macwho I now call betsy.Yes, it is a very powerful language, butthe books on it are inadiquate and very badly written.But it appears to be the future of programming in that itcan when used right , do things thatare impossible in True Basic even for a long timeprogrammer."
5,A real page turner!,"Loved this book. Couldn't put it down. I felt like I was in the story and experienced all that the boys did in their adventures. This book had it all - it was sometimes pretty funny and amusing and contained a story about friendship, adventure, scouting, morals, messages, and mystery. The author writes eloquently and did his research. Loved the author's take on life. I would highly recommend this book to everyone, with a note that if you are a baby boomer, you will really relate. Thanks for a great book! Can't wait for your next one."
4,Pompei Dining Chairs,"I gave the Hillsdale Furniture Pompei Dining Chairs, only 4 stars, because 2 of the chairs, had a spot on the chair cushion. I like the chairs, althought they don't go very well with the table that I have, too much iron, I think. I thought I was ordering 2 chairs, and I got 4 chairs. They were packaged well. It took me almost 2 days to put four chairs together, but I am 72 yrs old, and I have arthritis, in my fingers. Kept dropping the tool, that came with the other tools, to put the chairs together with. It probably wouldn't take a man as long to put together. They are of good quality. I like the chairs, but I think I will give them to my granddaughter. They would look beautiful with the matching table. They are heavier, than I thought they would be, or hoped they would be. As each day goes by I like them better. All of the tools, that were needed, were packed with the chairs."
3,didnt get my purchase,"I bought two of the same book. One from amazon, one from ebay. Only one came. Unfortunately didn't pay attention from whom the book came. So I am out one book."
3,Some of what Calvary believes,"Fine book but doesn't accurately portray the depth of Chuck Smith's ultra fundamentalist preoccupation and focus on the end times. Additionally, if you are confused by the ""From the gutter-most to the utter-most"" review it is because it is not about this book - it is about Harvest, co-authored by Chuck Smith and Tal Brooke. Come on, reviewers, at least read the book!"
5,"A Great Gift Book to Inspire Kids. Great for Classrooms, Too","Marsden succeeds again with her second novel, Silk Umbrellas. It gently transports us to the world of a rural Thai girl whose artistic sensibilities are emerging even as she struggles with her family's survival issues. The descriptions of how she forms images in her mind, paints the umbrellas, and gains confidence as an artist are sure to appeal to young artists worldwide. The compelling story and details of present-day, rural life in Thailand make this story worthy of classroom study. It would be a cultural eye opener for many American children and is sure to spark discussion. Parents will want the book for home use, too-kids will treasure this inspiring read."
3,Lit group with 10-12 year olds,"I am a teacher of 5/6 grade students. We read this book together as an extension of our studies on Southeast Asia. Here is what kids had to say.Kid 1: I liked it but I wanted more. I wanted an ending that wrapped things up more. I was depressed by it.Kid 2: I liked it, but it needed more action. The grandmother seemed like she was dying, and I think she should have.Kid 3: I agree with the above.Kid 4: Needed more action and a better ending.Kid 5: Same.Kid 6: It was written with great literary skills, but I think they needed a little more cliffhangers, stuff that held you on the edge of your seat.Kid 7: Needs some mystery in it.Teacher: We had some good discussions about the book, especially the issue surrounding the older sister and her need to join a factory. I especially liked the various mention of Thai foods and customs. My students have a deeper sense of Southeast Asian life from reading this.:)"
1,lasted 1 service day,The valve on this lasted through the first 2 hours of 1 wedding. I suppose I should call Amazon but since it is sold through a third party I have no idea who to contact for repair or parts. I haven't had the time soit is sitting in it's box and we have purchased another brand.
3,It doesn't read well in the Kindle format,"I love the information in this book, but I have to mark it down for the way it looks in kindle. The publisher should be ashamed of themselves for publishing this book so poorly in kindle. What's wrong you may ask?Some of the words in the kindle form are missing!Some of the words are very light almost unreadable.This is ridiculous, this book cost $9 bucks or more, and you have the nerve to toss it out to folks any kind of way, WOW."
3,Already bundled in another ebook here,"Neville Goddard is definately a different slant than many other ""new thought"" others I have read. He seems to have much less reservation about acting on other people than would be considered ethical today. Possibly it is a radical interpretation of we are all one, so other people are really Me, so I can manipulate/control/mess with them. It made me examine my core beliefs."
4,window/mirror plush,"My oldest daughter purchased this for her sister as a Christmas present. It is very soft and very cute, but very small. It came with a string from its head and a suction cup, so if you choose to, you can put it on a mirror, window or car window. It's more of a ""set it on the shelf and admire"" plushy as opposed to one you can snuggle or play with."
5,A must watch dvd for adoptive parents and children,This DVD gives a great insight into the world of adoption at the later stages in life and makes you realise how important it is to take a roots trip when your adopted child gets older.............
1,Lacking in Depth,"We have two adopted girls from China, now ages 15 and 19. We sat down as a family to watch this video, with great anticipation. It is a sleeper, lacking depth. There is so much of a story to be told about Chinese adoptions and this one misses the mark.Reminded me of a college freshman film project. Sorry to be negative, but it simply wasn't worth our time to watch."
2,I was expecting something else,That video didn't do it for me. I found the subject was treated in a shallow way and I was expecting a little more depth.Suzanne
2,Boring,"Clutch, crinkle and Done. A one time grab was all this was good for. She never grew to like it. It was cute in the nursery though."
3,Great Nuggets of Information--Just Hard to Get To,"Mintzberg is a brilliant strategist, and due to the extensive knowledge, it is hard at times to get to point of the concept. In some cases, the information is provided in almost elementary style, which is not bad, but most of the writings are very hard to digest. I did learn a great deal from this book, but I admit, I will have to reengage it again to get the full benefit."
1,leaking at the base,"I bought 2 units last year. At first it worked fine. Then, this season, when I started to use the air conditioners, one of the unit leaked at the base, ruining my wood floor. I thought I could just use it without water, and I found it to be very insufficient to cool off the room. I have used different models of pinguino and I found that the newer models are more problematic. If it isn't leaking, then it is the alarm light that kept coming on, shutting down the unit. I followed the maintenance procedure to clean the unit, but it doesn't seem to help. I am fed up with pinquino. I think I may have to switch back to those window units."
1,No service centers for Pinguino products,"I purchased a Pinguino PAC 700T 3 years ago. Rated at 12,000 BTUs, it cools about as well as a 6000 BTU in-window unit. However, at the beginning of this summer season, I find that it no longer cools or dehumidifies air. I found DeLonghi's central service number (800-322-3848 in case you need it) and asked for my nearest service/repair center. They informed me that they no longer have any repair centers in Massachusetts. They suggested that I take the unit to Hartford, CT, about 2 hours from Boston where I live. Having paid $1300 for this unit just 3 years ago, I expected better service than this. It appears that DeLonghi maybe doesn't care too much about supporting their products after the sale. This will be my last DeLonghi product of any kind."
1,"Unreliable, overpriced","I bought the 700T 4 years ago--Since I live in the Northeast, it has been lightly used---It DID work well when it worked--The 3 rd year it needed a circuit board at a cost of $238----was out to be serviced for 10 weeks while the repairer waited for a circuit diagram and the part during the heat of summer--- This year the cooling unit went--the warranty will cover the part but the labor will be $200---I have chosen to cut my losses by discarding it (I'm told by several people there is no market for a used A/C)--At an original cost of $1400 it is a poorly built product and overpriced and I will not put another cent into it---I wrote DeLonghi asking for some consideration but received an anonymous form letter stating there is ""nothing"" they can do--what they mean is that there is nothing they CHOOSE to do----Bottom Line: POOR Product; VERY POOR Customer Service"
4,Good looking and works for me.,"well shipped without problems, then when I started the unit, I heard some unexpected noise. It turns out one of the part was touching plastic cover so I had to do a little operation to fix it. But since then, it works fine very silent. It has 12,000 BTU. I don't know the relativity, but it cools down my living and dining area (about 400 to 500 SF). It won't make the space cold but, again it cools down."
3,NOT RELATED TO ATMOSPHERE!!!,"I don't know anything about this album with the exception that it is not in any way, shape or form related to S.L.U.G. of Atmosphere. I am only writing a review so people don't have to listen to sample tracks to find out that this is the case.Otherwise, I'm sure the album's fine and dandy, I just don't really care about it because it ISN'T related to Atmosphere.Thanks for your time."
5,Love at first bar,"The first time I heard the music of Salif Keita was in Senegal in 1993. I found SORO on tape in a market in Dakar. I fell in love with his music the first time I listened to him. There is something almost spiritual that moved me when I heard his voice. When I saw him in concert in Washington, DC in 1994, I was not disappointed. His concerts are definitely an experience. I took a couple of friends with me and they were truly impressed with his performance."
3,If you are really interested...,"This is an odd-ball black comedy about an actress/star of some hokey crime show who ends-up hiding out with her lunk-head brother in some dilapidated shack, which happens to contain their newly deceased mother buried in the basement. Along with suggestions of brother/sister incest, more bodies wide-up in the cellar. It's not really a horror movie, just really weird--although Julie Lebreton, as the sister, is pretty hot. The only reason why I'm writing this review is because if you are dying to have this movie, you can go the Amazon.ca (Canada) site and get it for $10 and not get ripped-off here."
5,Another satisfied customer,"The price was right, the shipping time was super, I would not hesitate to re-order again. Thanks!"
3,Sony mini-Cd's 8cm 200 MB,Satisfied with the price I paid and the time frame delivered. (BUT) product was NOT NEW. Only 49 discs were in the package. Four of the discs separated throughout the spindle were cracked and one was scratched up all over the disc. These were located throught the middle of the spindle. None of them were next to each other.I therefore received a total of 44 usable discs.
3,It's decent,"I think Rutherford should have taken over from Collins on vocals when Phil left. He's rough sounding but so was Gabriel anyway. He is kind of like Gabriel singing 'Back in NYC'This album is basically 80's pop. However, one track, A day to remember, is very progressive. I also like Halfway there, the title track and the album closer, kind of touching and heart on sleeve."
1,Failed solo attempt from Genesis guitarist Rutherford,"This very weak solo outing by Genesis guitarist Mike Rutherford isn't going to make anyone forget Mike and the Mechanics, or even ""Smallcreep's Day"". The only notable thing about it is that Rutherford, who does his own singing, has a surprisingly decent rock voice. The songs are all second-rate, with ""Halfway There"" the best of the batch.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
1,Hide it away,"The last track of this album ""Hideaway"" is a classic ballad and remains completely out of place on this hideous offering. The guy can't sing, well no better than I can anyway. You'd probably come across this album because your a Genesis or Mike and the mechanisc devotee. You'll be disappointed. Stangely enough, his first solo ""Small Creeps Day"" was also mostly trash with perhaps a couple of really good tracks. I loved early Genesis and followed them up until ""Duke"" . This album proves that I got of the bus at about the right time."
3,Art History without Art,"This is more a history of art patronage and politics than an analysis of Spanish painting during this period. It reduces art criticism to tracing a uni-dimensional causality: why who commissioned whom. There is very little analysis of the paintings themselves, the painters' distinct artistic personalities or the intellectual milieu which shaped these works, most notably trends within Counter-Reformation piety. The book does cover the major painters (and many minor and best forgotten ones) in the major centers of artistic production in the peninsula. The pictures many in black and white are ample and well-reproduced."
5,Lovely,This is not the complete book but rather a few selections of St. Augustine's masterpiece. The selections highlight the depth and beauty of his writing and would make for a wonderful introduction to this book for anyone who hasn't read it. It is marvelously illustrated and the art really enhances the work.
3,Confessions of St Augustine,"This is a ninety-page collection of excerpts from the personal writings of Saint Augustinus, offering a revealing look into his experience and worldviews, his prayer life, and his sins and shortcomings. Almost every page has a beautiful medieval illumination, making this a lovely and wildly colorful book.I only give it three stars because, considering that this is only a slice of his full work, I think I paid too much money for it. The artwork is why I give it 3 stars instead of 2."
2,Disappointingly short,"Much of the 96 pages is taken up by religious artwork from various 15-century artists. The actual citations from Augustine's Confessions are disappointingly few. It's a very pretty book, and the citations that are included are quite powerful, but I purchased this book to read about Augustine's conversion, not look at pretty pictures.I suppose if one wanted to get a brief summary of Augustine's conversion, than this is the book for you, but I also suppose at this low price, one not ought to expect too much."
1,shipped wrong size,"I specifically asked for the 09-10 year model and 07-08 was sent I tried to see if it would fit and it wouldn't because the hole pattern was all wrong, would not line up...I have to return this and hopefully get what I asked for. Product in general is fine just sent me the wrong size."
2,Just alright...,"While in theory a book about debunking or confirming old wives' tales sounds fairly interesting, the setup of this book lead to lots of repetition. Several of the tales were too similar to each other to really merit separate explanations. Others I had never heard of before, or have since been debunked as pure folly since the book's publication (I think it was '87). The authors also tried to be rather cutesy and make jokes which usually left me rolling my eyes. An interesting book to skim, but I wouldn't recommend reading big sections at once as I did."
2,Dissapointing,I bought this cd thinking it would be as good as the first urbal beats but its not. Quite a dissapointing cd
4,An average of the two discs together...,"There are two discs here, and they're actually quite different from each other, so I'm going to review each disc on its individual merits.Disc One: 3 stars. There's some good songs here (Natural Born Chillers, Fatboy Slim, Wildchild, Portishead, Uberzone) but there are many tracks that are just mediocre or disappointing (namely, the decidedly inferior mixes of the Crystal Method and Prodigy tracks) and, unfortunately, this is not a continuous mix. Finally, it could have used more tracks with less hip-hop influence... there's more than one type of techno out there.Disc Two: 5 stars. A bunch of classics continually mixed together, the album never loses momentum and it keeps a constant groove to it. Of course, with classic songs like ""Go,"" ""Charly,"" ""Chime,"" ""Cubik,"" and ""Strings Of Life,"" how could you go wrong?Bottom line: the average of 3 stars and 5 stars = 4 stars."
3,A letdown,"This CD was a big letdown.. it was recommended by the person at the record store, looked good, etc. Basically disc 1 was too jungle for me. There are some tunes that are pretty good, but there are some downright angry-feeling ones as well. Temper-temper gave me a headache and ""release YO' Delf""--well, you can figure it.Disc 2 was much better, but still not enough to compell me to repeat the purchase.Summary: Disc1 1-2 stars, Disc2 3-4 stars"
4,Its a good start...,"If u look at it dis way... this is a good cd for people who are trying to put some techno into their collection, and by doing so this is a great start. I mostly have hiphop and dj albums, and this cd gave me a good look into techno. I recommend this cd and the first Urbal Beats cd too."
2,wrong disks in case,u put the wrong disk in the case it isnt what i paid for and am not able to return them to u due to someone else
4,great intro to electronica,this is a good introduction to anyone who wants to sample some good electronic music...i like the first CD a lot better than the second CD though. listening to the two CD's got me through workday commute in a fairly good mood :)
3,"Quick shipping, condition not quite what I expected","This book arrived fast. However, it was advertised as ""like new"", and the book has some highlighting on many pages. It's not excessive, but it's also not ""like new"". To me, ""like new"" means I don't see what somebody *else* thought was important, I see pages that look like a new book with no highlighting. But, on balance, since I only paid a few dollars for the book, it was worth it."
4,Decent for learning,"This book is very good. It is best suited for a student who is willing to put a good amount of time into his/her studying. The reason I say this is because it is very detailed, the diffenitions are very thorough and at times confusing, and there is a wide range of topics covered. It probably would not be good for a first year student unless they really want to learn the material which is a little dry at times. I thought that the opening cases in each chapter was a good way to tie the material to real life situations. Overall, this is a great tool for learning."
4,Organizational Behavior,"I thought this book was a very useful resource for many of my business classes. It applied many different disciplines to the study of organizations. I also was pleased in the format of the book. It was easy to read as the most important definitions were outlined on the margins. The examples used through the text, especially real business applications, were useful. I felt this book was up to date, especially in its website addresses to many useful organizations and data bases. However, many of the same business applications were used in repition throughout the book. This was a minor problem due to the direction for additional applications in references to internet sites. Overall I was pleased."
5,Sylvie Guellam is amazing!!,"Sylvie has extension and feet like nobody has seen in a long time! the pas de deux are choreographically fantastic, altough it is not a classical story line. great dancing!"
4,excellent,This movie is both inspirational and captivating. This movie has been a favorite of mine for many years and now I am trying to find another copy of it.
3,Okay,This book was not to bad. But after reading The Witching Hour...... Over all this book is pretty good.
5,Good Helpful Way to Learn Basic Travel French,This series is a nice way to learn basic travel French so one can easier survive and enjoy their visit. The speakers are clear and easy to understand. There is a chapter bar on the top of the screen if you move your mouse and it is easy to access chapters. I highly recommend this before going to France and since you can download this to your ipod.
4,Very easy to learn,"This DVD system makes learning some basic French very easy. Plus since it is only 2 hours long, it doesn't take forever to get some basic language learned. I recommend this DVD."
4,Merci beaucoup,It is a French cultural immersion experience. There are ten lessons in basic travel French. You are reminded to have fun as the phrases are mastered. The individual lessons may be replayed again and again. One is warned about the use of the twenty-four hour clock in France in regard to making reservations. There is additional vocabulary covered in the audio appendix. More information is contained in the U Print feature. This product constituted a very good and agreeable refresher of my high school French.
2,A refresher if you once spoke the language,"Here's what this disk is for. If you have a basic knowledge of French or a memory of having learned it back in the once-upon-a-time, this will refresh your memory in preparation for a trip. The disk is easy to install and use on both MacBook and iPod, although you'll have to provide your own case for safe-keeping.This would probably not be of much help if you were starting from no knowledge at all- at best it would tune your ear to the sound of the language, although the demanding and fussy pronuciation of French might overwhelm this simple disk. It certainly wouldn't work if you wanted any understanding of the structure of the language so that you could apply it in a real setting."
2,idon't Think So,"As I stated in my review for the Italian ivideo Language Lab, this program is a good idea boringly executed. Best for those already on their flight to Par-ee with no good books to read, the ivideo lab presents speakers repeating lists of words against a french-y backdrop.Snoozeville.The speakers are excellent, and the idea of learning a language on your ipod a very good one, but it is very hard to learn a language through rote memorization. A story format would have been so much better. Watch ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" on your ipod instead. Allez!Grade: C"
3,"Pretty Basic, Random Stuff","While the concept here is great, this video learning structure isn't very well organized, moves very quickly and probably won't give you much in the way of functional competency in French. If used with other types of lessons it might be of benefit, but standing alone it is of limited usefulness."
2,"shoddy build quality, not impressed.","Okay first of all the size of this thing would lead you to believe its possible to store several medium sized plants on either shelf. The problem here lies in the shelving itself, which is just very thin and cheap crosshatched wire. These ""shelves"" mount to the even flimsier frame with a single bolt in each anchor point, all of which feels like its going to snap in half while putting together. The shelves are also bowed in center, without anything on it. Point being, its not stable... with or without weight.Might be okay for a tray of seedlings. Anything heavier just doesnt sit right. I certainly would not trust this thing in an important greenhouse environment."
5,True Masterpiece,This cd is the best.A real Masterpiece.But the Explicit verson is much better.Buy it.Best Hip Hop cd of all time.CHUUUCH
4,good,"best songs- drop it like its hot, oh no, signs (even though jt is on it), lets get blown, girl like u, and no thang on me"
3,A Rosetta for Ancient Martian,"This story is about an archaeological study of the (fictional) ancient civilization on Mars, and how the Earth scientists learned how to read the Martian language. The key turns out to be surprising, yet in the end scientifically obvious. The Mars in the story is somewhat outdated by the recent robotic explorers, but it's still a good read, with a believable background of science politics. One minor jarring note is the characters who smoke cigarettes."
3,A great way to beat the rain.,Dug out my Playstation 1 and didn't want discard it. Purchased this and a few other games and gave it to my nephews. Haven't seen them in the sunlight since. I go into the cave occasionally to teach the youngsters what pain is.
4,BOOOOOOOOM! a good game,"This is a pretty good game. But when i first played this game i thought it was kind of boring, but as i plyed it more and more i began to like it.It is a cool game but i would like it if they had made the explosions a little...better.since i've already beat the game I can't wait to by Ace Combat 3."
4,Fun but No Sticks,"My first Ace combat game was Electrosphere or number 3 in 98 so 12 years later i decided to give this one a go. It's a lot of fun, and after you configure your controls to how you like it becomes even better. Compared to 3, this one is a bit more fast paced, but the graphics are noticeably lower in quality.The one quarrel I have, though it is a given for all pre 96ish (i think) PlayStation games is you can't use the analog sticks, which i always used in the third AC, and even though it's just a little stick, not having it really takes away from the flying feel."
5,Grr Growl Snarl...,"I went to purchase this wonderful game and IT'S NOT AVAILABLE, and I only have a gift certificate, and can't buy it used...GRRR"
4,Great fun and pretty realistic!,"For the ""Ace combat"" initiated, this game is a lot better that the original ""Ace Combat"" for it's graphics and play, although I have to say how much I enjoyed ""Ace Combat"" too, in the beginning. Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing - a must for the correct deployment of missiles. Missions are plentiful and, in addition to the possibility to select a wingman (or, indeed wing""woman"" as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included) you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission, or do the mission without support, as you wish. There are the usual night missions and canyon-runs, and plenty of planes to choose from. Game action is very smooth too. The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great. An enjoyable game!"
3,The Four Witnesses,"There are plenty of nuggets that justify the effort it takes to stay with this book, such as glimpses of how Paul might have influenced the shape of the gospels. Overall, Mr. Griffith-Jones' opaque style seriously clouds what could have been a more illuminating study. I wonder if he meant to be so inaccessible. The author has plenty of insight to share, but spends much of the reader's patience on elaborate and contorted constructs which sometimes turn into circular thinking, and often lead to a fairly mundane point. He also wanders off for pages into tangential texts without making it clear they add all that much (a few do). The most valuable thing I got from the book, and it is significant, is a fresh sense of how audacious the Gospel messages were and are. This alone made a sometimes frustrating read worthwhile."
4,Jesus emerges from Gospels,"Although the author directs the book toward the lay person most lay persons will find it difficult to read. However, this should not deter them for there is material worth the struggle. The question again emerges ""Who do you say that I am?"" Griffin-Jones presents a portrait of an answer housed in the writings of one called the Rebel, another a Rabbi, another a Chronicler and finally the Mystic. The author takes us into the cultural setting of each gospel where we seek the presence of the one who comes to us in the same question but in differing explanations. It is a rich and rewarding book, one that bears reading more than once."
2,huh?,"Like other reviewers, I was dismayed by the poor writing style. I found myself reading the same sentences over and over, without ever figuring out what the point was. But even overlooking the problems with the style, the content is sparse. I reread the section on Mark several times and couldn't really find much to support the author's thesis about his motivations and political stance, even though I know from other readings that the evidence is there. All in all this turned out to be quite a disappointment, especially since this is a topic that merits a far deeper and more carefully thought out exploration than one can find here."
2,No bueno,"While I learned some things about what it was like in Rome and surrounding communities when the early church was forming, I will second, third, fourth and fifth the other reviewers who say he would tell us what he was going to say and then not tell us. He was long-winded, and I found no real conclusion to the entire book, though it felt like he was trying to lead up to one. Perhaps I missed it."
3,Old school batman,"This book is very good, but it has repetitive and sometimes lame stories leaving it with little to moderate rereading value."
3,only 2x magnification,"I like the idea of a big magnifier, and one that is 5"" fits the bill perfectly. Unfortunately, the magnification power wass not stated anywhere on the product page when I purchased it. It's merely 2 times magnification. For me, it has limited usefulness.At least Amazon has corrected the problem."
5,Big view,One can see a whole page with this magnifier.It is sturdy and a good buy.Good for students and seniors alike.
4,Not bad,Good Magnifier. I've several different magnifiers and this one is one of the better ones. I'm giving it four starts because of the price (can be cheaper)
4,BigEye,"This magnifier is the right size and magnification for a preschooler, but it is a bit heavy for small hands. The 2x magnification is good for the youngster, but we will have to show her how to hold it with two hands. I like that the lens is plastic, not glass, or it would really be heavy!"
2,Disappointed - only 2X magnification - maybe,"I bought this for my 6 year-old granddaughter who just happens to love bugs. It's very sturdy and she loves it, so we'll keep it. The overall quality is much better than I expected, after reading the reviews. I'm sure she'll have hours of fun with it. So what's the problems, you ask? The listing says nothing about the magnification level. I was expecting maybe 3-5x. The packaging says 2X. I don't think so.... Doesn't magnify hardly at all. She wants to be able to count the number of legs on her pill bugs, centipedes and bees. She'll have to find some other way. I'll get her a ""10X"" magnifier and hope for 5X. Her friends can use this one."
4,A crutch for failing eyes,This is the second one of these I've bought. Now I keep one in the living room and one beside the computer in my office. The large size lets me read whole sentences and paragraphs when the type is too small for aging eyes. Like this type!
1,BigEye is Big Ripoff!,"Although the manification ratio is great and the lens does not distort, the manifying glass is very cheaply made. The plastic reminds me of a cheap toy bought a a junk store. The plastic handle totally disintegrated the first time I used it and fell off. So, now I don't have a magnifying glass to use and I'm out the money it cost to buy it. I am very disappointed in this product. I would rather pay more to have them redesign this product using a better quality hard plastic for the lens rim and especially the handle."
3,BigEye Magnifiying Glass,"Product is pretty good. I find it a little akward and/or heavy to handle. For the price, you can't beat it. I wished I had spent a few more $$$ and gotten a more professional glass."
5,"As described, arrived quickly, all good.","As described, arrived quickly, all good. It makes stuff look bigger...Not a complicated item. Six more words are required. Here they are. IMPORTANT: One of the glasses arrived broken, I called and it was replaced immediately, arrived two days later. Excellent customer service! Problems can happen. It's how it's handled that matters to me, and these guys did good."
3,Junk,"It does magnify but the distortion jumps exponentially as the magnification increases, so you only get about 3x worth of usable magnification."
4,Magnifier,Its good for the use for which it was purchase.I thought it would have been a stronger to be used for other purposes
5,You are at the righ place,"This is definitely the book you want to check out, in the run up of the flu and vaccination scare.Get the p.d.f version here:tr. im / AJkl"
2,Dated and repetitive,"I was frustrated with this purchase. Yes, it does some good documentary work in the conversations it captures and relates. However, the three documentaries it contains are largely repetitive. Also they feel a little dated since they were apparently done dozen years ago. I would not recommend this to anyone else."
4,Nice Shirt True to Photo,"I ordered the 3XL and despite my size, there is room in it for another person. It came very fast, the company is very efficient. I've dealt with them before and am pleased with their service.I also like the fact that the picture is true to what arrived."
1,Pretty but expensive coasters,I love Sony electronics. My stereo and cd walkman are Sony products. They are durable and last a long time. Unfortunately I can't say the same about Sony's CD-Rs. I just bought this 20 pack of multicolor CD-Rs this weekend to burn some cds for a friend. I have already had to toss out five CD-Rs because they did NOT work. I had the same problem with another kind of Sony CD-Rs. I thought it was fluke but I guess not. Never will I ever buy any CD-R with the name Sony on it. I'll stick with my trusty ol' Maxwell. They have never failed me once. Even 3M makes better CD-Rs than Sony and that's just sad. Avoid Sony's CD-Rs if possible unless you have money to throw away.
2,Sony name is not enough,"Like other reviewers, I trusted the Sony name, but it turns out that's not enough. Of the first 6 discs I used, 2 were bad. Amazon politely gave me a refund, but I would not order these again. Can't imagine why Sony doesn't just recall them, as this damaged my trust in their brand."
3,Buy at your own risk.,"The picture showing this product is actually discontinued by Sony. It is NOT what Amazon ships to you. The product pictured is 20CDQ80LX3. The product that ships is 20CDQ80RX. It has 20 CD-Rs just like the yellow box but only SHRINK WRAPPED! Mine was torn and some of the hinges of the jewel cases were BROKEN!! I had extra cases so I replaced them. Although only 3 or 4 were broken. Keep in mind there are no paper inserts, all the companies are doing that now. I burned all 20 CD-Rs and I have to say the discs were in perfect shape and burned perfectly. In the end I guess that's what matters. Sony makes some of the best damn CD-Rs you can buy and are a great alternative to Memorex or should I say rebranded Imation products."
4,Good USB soundcard interface,"I use this for a soundcard interface on an old IBM Thinkpad T21 using a PCMCIA USB 2 adapter. It is much quieter than the onboard sound. It works OK, but seems to have rather variable latency which makes it unreliable with Speaker Workshop (a freeware acoustic measurement app). I am not sure if this is due to the way I am using it or if it is a limitation of the hardware. It seems to work alright with Soundeasy (another acoustic measurement application)."
2,seemed watered down,"I was very excited to find curve shower gel, and I was awaiting the product in hopes of ordering about 10 more. Unfortunately, it was very watered down and thin. The company is selling the product for a great price, but when you total in the shipping, I don't think it's worth it for the quality of the product. I've left a message with customer service and hope to remedy the situation."
2,Useless without Manager cable,"all i can say is this unit is useless without the manager cable, period. I give ""Vema Electronics"" and Amazon 5 stars. Vema Elec. was very courteous and professional when it came down to returning the product. The Management cable is very important for this product, if it is not in the box at the time of shipping please let the customer know."
2,Networking a modem? Kinda silly...,"While this piece of hardware works flawlessly--and, as another reviewer notes, is a great way to turn a modem into an Ethernet feed--it's a silly concept to actually network more than 1 computer using a conventional modem as found in the RM356. Once you see this thing in action feeding 4 computers, you understand how silly the concept is... not to mention that 4 56kbps modems are, in fact, cheaper than this 1 unit.In short, get (or wait for) broadband, make sure your broadband modem is of the ethernet variety, then buy one of the multitude of lower priced switches/minihubs available here and elsewhere if you want to share that connection."
3,Darkside review of Lust for Mommy Tomb,"Want to see Misty Mundae naked? Dig in. The plot, story, acting, who gives a flying fluck. If you're really looking for any kind of entertainment here other than full frontal naked Misty Mundae and big brown beaver. You're truly pathetic."
1,Very disapointing,"I don't know how people liked this movie... compared to other movies of the same type. Most of softcore movies don't have good stories, but this one has none. The sex scenes are boring. Most of the actress, except Misty, are bad looking.I think I waisted my money on this one."
3,Pretty good mount.,"This mount works well. Installed easily. It should have a set screw though. With the back angle it needs to be able to lock in the pole. Otherwise, a good pole mount."
5,How did he get all this information?,"Both the books on the South and North Carolina Revolutionary War sites are amazing. I drove one tour and traveled to other related sites this summer. The material adds so much depth to the experience of visiting the southern operations of the Revolutionary War. Visiting and studying the information took quite a bit of time for me. I am sure, after reading much of the book, that Barefoot went to all these sites. Even if he didn't the research is so well done, it must have taken forever to compile it all.These are great books and essential reads for the Revolutionary War enthusiast."
4,Well researched and insightful,"We are often told of how musicians and singers touch their audience with their work. But this book puts that sort of insight into a historical context which is quite compelling. We learn much from oral history and the author's own experience, but the author obviously did more than scholarly homework for this project. There is an authoritative command of the subject matter. I would recommend this book to any Dylan fans or those studying popular culture in general. For better and for worse, Dylan is a historical figure and shaped a generation with his move from folk to pop. His contribution to popular music should not be underestimated. Dr. CP Lee of Salford University gives this subject the serious study it deserves."
2,Disappointing,"For some reason this was a disappointing read. Of course any information about Bob Dylan and especially this concert is great, but the way it's processed in this book is distracting. The best parts are the stories of the people who were there. The least effective were Lee's cultural analyses and song analyses. The more he writes the more he gets further and further away from Bob Dylan, it seems. The music from this show is so great, and deserves better. That those great songs are trod through local cultural suppositions is distasteful. Scrounge around for Eat the Document, listen to the Live 1966 album, leave this book in the dustbin."
1,"Redundant, overpriced, and poorly written","You can buy Bob Dylan's LIVE 1966 in any self-respecting record store, and it comes with liner notes superior to this book."
1,Bugged,"Extreme Chess will not run. First the Launcher crashes the system, then when manually installed, the program asks for the disk to be inserted. The disk IS inserted, but it says ""that is not the Extreme Chess Disk"". Tried on 4 different computers, 3 with XP, and one with 98. Same thing.This 20 dollar program is a coaster.If I hadn't bought it months ago, and just got around to installing, I'd ask for my money back."
4,This guy is actually quite good!!,"I bought this cd from Amazon.com,the only place to get yourproducts on time!! As of everyone else on this review,I wasa little sceptical,listening to his father(James) for some 20 years.Its a very ""progressive"" cd, but after about 4or 5 listenings,I really liked his concepts. You can hear bothJames and carly Simon,doing harmonies. This CD kinda remindedof listening to James's early album ""James Taylors OriginalFlying Machine""(recorded in 1962)and the ""apple"" cd of James(recorded in 1967). I feel Ben was really trying to""makea statement and he did very well. The werid tune is ""tonight""that is an instrumental, that you dont know where he is going.He had done a Beatle tune about 3 years ago, Ihad wishedhe had put this in. You will reconize one tune ""right off the bat"" Good luck Ben."
4,interesting debut,"great selection of songs and and excellent debut album. I felt the production and arrangement could be a little more polished, but generally a terrific album paving the way for a great future."
4,Fresh,"It makes a pleasant change to hear something fresh these days, and Ben Taylor is just that. This is pop music, with hints of rock, and folk. But somehow it's different to all the jangly me-too stuff you hear on the radio. Musically it's ambitious, and strives hard to be unique in its arrangements and melodies. And there's Ben's familiar (to anyone who knows his father's music) voice as the icing on the cake. Okay, so he sounds like his father, but honestly I prefer Ben's velvety tones.The songs are pretty much all very catchy, with good hooks, nice harmonies. I wouldn't call any of them great in the true sense, but this is nice, upbeat music that puts you in a good mood, and there's too little of that around."
3,Nothing new in this book,"This book is about using both sides of your brain in a synergistic fashion. The book teaches you about using ""learning maps"" to improve the learning process by using your visual skills and imagination. There is also a brief overview of memory techniques.The book is very easy to read. It is fairly small, concise and covers the topic in a no-nonsense manner. The book contains useful tips, examples and practical applications of the tools described. Note that these ""learning maps"" are identical to the mind maps promoted by Tony Buzan... Although the book is a good introductory text, I found the treatment rather shallow I would have preferred a book with more detail.If you're completely new to the concept of mind mapping and memory techniques, this book could server as a good primer. Else, have a look at the books of Tony Buzan they're much more worthwhile."
4,Uber-cute....,"Alright--it doesn't get any cuter or sweeter than this. Characters are named after sweets, and their base is a pastry cafe built to look like a tiered wedding cake. They attack with bells and batons, and their enemies are mice, sparrows, and other everyday animals that aliens have injected with something to make them big. And the preteen love story is there in its entirety.This is a cute series, but don't read it if you have an allergy to cute."
2,TMM V.4,So... I started this series when I was in middle school and never finished it and the unfinished set on my bookshelf really annoyed me. Series is cute overall... nothing too special.
5,Toyko Mew Mew book #4,"I was lucky enough to find this book for my 12 year old daughter who is just getting into Manga. The book and the series are fantastic, and if you are lucky enough to find one, grab it!"
3,Practical use,What can I say? It's a piece of plastic designed to magnify stuff when I look through it. That's what it does.The shipping cost at least 3 times what it was worth but it would have cost about the same in the store
1,Save your money,"I love 80's new wave. But this isn't the CD to buy if your looking for a good compilation. Alot of amatuer stuff here.Best tracks in my opinion are ""Cruel Summer"" by Philtron and ""Unveiling the Secret"" by Rational Youth. Worst Tracks are ""Major Tom"" by Chiasm and ""Blue Monday"" by Silent Promises.There are a few other decent tracks but nothing to justify the money spent."
4,One of the best shooting games with a gun I've played,"If you like Area 51, then times the fun factor by three and you have Time Crisis. The NAMCO gun is extremely accurate (the gun and game are a ""packaged"" deal).... A good time if you like a shooting game with a gun...."
5,Very Nice Game,"I got what I payed for in this game. For one theing this game is basically just like the arcade game and happens to come with the Namco Guncon. This is very convenient in price as well as getting a good game. If you enjoyed the arcade game I seriously doubt you will find this much different. But of course if you don't like this game you must look on the brighter note that you have equally recieved the Guncon. You can use it on such games as Point Blank 2 & Die Hard Trilogy2. The game is fantastic. You actually save money getting this game. ... Get the game, be happy, have fun!"
5,WOW!,"Even though the story isn't too great, the fun factor, graphics, and intensity make this game a must have. It is too bad that NAMCO doesn't release the sequel to this sweet game sooner."
4,An American drives the length of Norway,"Dale Johnson drives from Oslo in the south of Norway to Tromso in the far north during spring and high summer. If the narrative wanders a bit at times, it's, nevertheless, intelligent. If you don't know anything about Norway, you may well learn as much as if you were to go there yourself. If some special effects a la Ed Wood are likely to drive you nuts - ghosts of previous centuries fading in and out at times, you may want to fast forward. But try not to be distracted."
4,"Sherlock Holmes stories on logic, maths & probability","Twelve short Sherlock Holmes stories challanging logic, probability, statistic, game theory, more or less relevant to daily life. The authors approach of telling the story seen through Holmes and Watson is brilliant (incl. the dialogue between the two). Some stories are a bit simple and boring while others were quite amazing. Example Chapter 7 illustrates the error of assuming that a well-defined ordering retlation must also define a unique hierarchy. In higher mathematics it is quite possible to have x greater than y, y greater than z, and yet z greater than x! Last but not least, the afterword is extremely useful where the author sheds more light on each chapter."
4,Good quality,"Very good quality. The only flaw I could find is that I checked it and got 99 instead of 100 - thus rated 4 and not 5.When crimped properly, testing it out on 45 lbs test leader wire against a strain > 45 lbs, the leader wire burst first which wasn't anywhere near to the crimp. This tells me these crimps has the ability to hold the leader wire it was made for."
4,Small but strong,"These barrel connectors are small and very strong, I did some test in the garage lifting different items and they did not pull out on some cases the wire snapped but the connector held."
1,"It could be of interest, but......","The first dip in the book shows a good promise. On closer inspection some unkind details will be obvious. The author uses different systems of co-ordinates in the text part of the book and in the FORTRAN-Listing, which seems to be an essential part of the book. In addition it is hard to believe that the FORTRAN-Program in that published version has ever run. The code contains both minor errors which are easy to detect and some weighty errors especially in the arrays used. As a reader I can not recognize the usefulness of publishing such a negligent written program listing. I think an interested reader will also regrat, that the book neither simple data records contains nor results."
1,luster,"if you are watching the movie to see norman reedus.i have to tell you ...you will be disappointed with his character (which is only in it for a moment,and that is a blessing),but the entire movie was poorly made on all levels."
1,Dull,"Another ""art"" and indie gay theme film. In this case I could make only through the first 50 minutes. How exciting time was it? Well, I managed to prepare my shopping list, go for a drink to the kitchen and I didn't think I had lost anything from the plot.I'd like to know, really!, the reason why people shoot such dull and stupid movies. Anybody?"
4,Luster,loved this film. confusion reins in the mind of the young.didn't help with all the cute youngs thing around him.
2,More like Lackluster,"It's a sad state of affairs when a low budget flick has more money than talent. There isn't much money thrown at Luster yet at times there seems to be even less in the way of talent.To be fair there are some rattling moments - mostly in the sped up, tagged on tragic ending. Truth be told there is a decent story here, just poorly told and, for the most part, horribly acted.There's a great indie film of post-metro-sexual revolution story of friendship, love and lust gone wrong buried somewhere in all of this. It's still waiting to be made."
2,Bad inside camera,"Any indoor pictures with poor lighting especially in churchs and wedding receptions come out streaky, blurry, out of focus and dark. Very disappointed in this camera. I read the manual and it states use the Sport for in Motion pictures, however, they still come out blurry. The auto setting does the same thing. This camera is great for outdoors and indoors with plenty of lighting. The 10X zoom is good when using a tripod. The camera is also good for up close pictures with a steady hand and tripod. I would have not bought this camera if I had known about these issues."
3,small annoyances,"I have been happy with the quality of the pictures which has been very rewarding. I do have a couple of compaints though that I find worth sharing with others interested in this camera. The reviews I read before my purchase stated how the pop the lense cap popping off every time you turn the camera on is quite annoying which I found to be the case. There's no option to just look at your photos without the lense pushing out and the cap popping off. I have found that a camera that has an automatic lense like that uses up the battery pretty quickly. I find I need to replace the battery every 3 months with just general use of the camera. If purchasing this camera, buy the recharger along with it and a case as well. Also, the camera is very awkward to carry around to events without a case."
4,Great camera for a good price,"Pros: The zoom on this camera is really nice, digital zoom is better than I expected, many manual options, small file size, good battery life, good color, good quality movies, 2 AA batteries. I have used it for 2 months with no major problems.Minor Cons: Lens cap comes off easily, Too much redeye indoors. Flash is back far on the camera, which can cause the light to be blocked on close up macro shots, No image stabilizer."
5,Easy to use with high quality,If you are looking for a reasonably prices 10x zoom camera that is easy to use and takes great pictures then this is your camera. I looked around at several different types of camera's including Digital SLR but settled in on the Z740. For my general use picture taking it has enough features and quality. It is a little slow between pictures but that is not new to me as a digital camera owner. If you need to take hundreds of pictures a minute this is not your camera. The on screen descriptions when you change settings on the camera were a nice addition for me (I never knew what half the stuff on my last camera was for).
4,Happy with camera,"I purchased this camera and was going to return it because of it's size (actually purchased a smaller camera with a larger LCD and returned it for lack of zoom and the gadgets). I love the zoom and the LCD is clear. My one disappointment is that the optical viewfinder is not very clear at all - gives a distorted view as someone else mentioned. I'm still on the original battery pack it came with after about 150 pictures. The software is very easy to use. I am a beginner with a digital and really enjoyed using all the different modes during a family trip to Disney. I printed pictures by downloading them to my computer and uploading them to a local drug store. I really obsessed over the purchase of this camera and after using it on our trip, I am very happy with my purchase. The camera is great for beginners, easy to use. great color, etc. The 4 stars is for the optical viewfinder."
3,Get yourself a GOOD camera,"Hard to believe I spent $300 for this camera when it first came out over 4 years ago but at the time it was one of the better point and shoots out there and was a HUGE step up from the 2 MP Sony I had before, so when we first got it we were blown away by the photo quality. I have moved on finally to a Canon XSI and while my wife and I took about 3,000 photos with this camera in 4 years, the build quality was horrible (the side door for the memory card slot is a very cheap plastic and will break off with time) and we were constantly frustrated by the extremely slow auto focus and missing out on shots. Also the camera really struggles to take decent shots at night, you need to take several photos and have a tripod to avoid blurred images even on the night setting. Overall it was a dependable camera but I looking back on it, it could have been a lot better. Hopefully Kodak has made some improvements on their more recent point and shoot cameras."
4,Awesome Camera BUT DOES ANYONE...,"I just used a friend's Z740 and the first thing i noticed is the LCD screen. Unlike any other digital camera I've looked at, this one looked like I was watching a fuzzy TV channel. It has a lot of noise and movement, not clear at all. When looking through the viewfinder, same thing... lights up and fuzzy noise moving around.I thought it was a defect and called Kodak. After lots of time on hold, the man reported to me that this is normal on the Z740 and that it's their only camera that does this. He said it's to compensate for low lighting. It's very annoying to me to see such a blurry preview.[...]The pictures turned out great, but it was difficult to tell if they were in focus before I took them because of all the noise on the LCD screen. i felt like i was using a videocamera.[...]Thanks!"
5,Kodac Z740,"We purchased this camera prior to a family trip to Las Vegas. We took over 100 pictures which varied from bright daylight to indoor and outdoor casino pictures. The multiple (easy to use) settings allowed us to quickly change from one setting to another. The Kodak software (inclued) makes the tranfer of pictures automatic and painless, with several options on picture modification. I would recommend this 5.0 MP camera for anyone, regardless of camera skills. I would further recommend you either purchase the Kodac rechargable battery system or buy the Energizer system with a minimum 2000 mAh battery. Disposible batteries do not last long in this camera, the rechargable batteries lasted an average of 4X longer, which is much more reliable and prevents the loss of ""that perfect Kodak moment"" with the children."
5,Tickled Pink!,"Once upon a time, I had another (smaller) Kodak digital camera. When it finally decided it was ready to die, I started looking for another Kodak to replace it. After looking at Amazon for quite a few months, I decided on the Z740. I got it on my birthday and have been in love with it ever since!It's so easy to use, takes great pictures, and the software allows me to manipulate my pictures in a variety of ways. I take it everywhere in case I need to capture something spectacular and it never lets me down! I'd buy another Z740 and I'd definately buy from Amazon again!"
5,Great Photos - Even Better Video!,"This is the only Camera you will ever need! I have had mine for 1.5 years and not only are the pictures great but I use a 2GB memory card for Video and the quality is amazing!!! I can take a video, load unto my computer and have a DVD for the family to watch in less than an hour (if you can't wait just plug in the cord and hookup to your TV and watch the video straight from the camera). I have retired my digital SONY handycam (which is a great video camera).I have used this camera extensively for the 1.5 years traveling to China, Europe and the US - no problems - Friends and Family are amazed at the quality of the pictures."
5,best digital camera before you go SLR,"Bought the Kodak z740 because I'm not a professional photographer who knows the ins and outs of a SLR. Photography is somewhat of a hobby of mine, I enjoy touching up family pics with Adobe Photoshop. So when I was looking to upgrade from my HP 850, I found the Kodak z740. It has all the features anyone could wish for and they are easy to use. But best of all it has a 10x optical zoom lens, plus 4x digital zoom. It has presets for almost any photo situation such as, people indoors, people outdoors, landscape, landscape at night, portrait at night, beach (bright lighting), and more. It's so easy to use, I played with it for days before opening the owners manual. And the quality of the pictures is excellent, crisp, clean, and colorful. If you want a digital camera packed with great features, a wide optical zoom capability, and 5 megapixels, all for well under $400, then the Kodak z740 can't be beat."
4,Kodak Z740,This is a fine camera and worth the price. It's easy to use and provides very good quality prints.
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars,"We bought this camera last January for our honeymoon. We have really put this camera to use. Great handy little camera but with two exceptions:(1) When taking pictures in dark places and using flash, it does not come out well.(2) When downloading pictures to your computer, they appear 2-3 shades darker than while looking at them on camera."
4,Kodak 10X zoom digital camera,"The camera works perfectly and is easy to use, as well as easy to set up the software on the PC. The only downside may be the lack of image stabilzation. Inside pictures using a flash were blurred on a number of shots, however that could be because the setting I was using was not the correct one or that I did not hold the down the shutter for focus before taking the picture."
4,My first digital camera,"Overall I'm very pleased with the Z740. In good lighting conditions everything works great. This camera is made for outside shots on a sunny day. But if you're inside with poor light you might run into a few problems with the zoom. It will take 5+ seconds to focus and even then the picture might turn out a little fuzzy. Don't get me wrong, the flash is very powerful. If you're not zoomed in it will take a perfect picture in complete darkness! The only other complaint I have is the lens cap will not stay on. Make sure you tie it to the strap or you'll probably end up loosing it.Lastly, the easyshare software that's included is great. Very easy to use and the options they give you to improve the quality of the picture actually work. I have paint shop pro X and it can't do some of the stuff the free Kodak program can."
3,there's one con that really makes me unhappy,"the one thing i really do not like is that you cannot zoom while filming video. this makes no sense to me as i would want to focus in on different things while filming. i understand that i'm buying it more for pictures but at 300 dollars i would at least expect to take video clips on trips.updated 11-30-05i replaced the camera with a canon S2 powershot and i would definitely recommend the canon over the kodak. the S2 has 12x optical zoom, 5MP, and takes beautiful video that allows you to zoom. the few indoor pictures i took with the kodak do not compare with canon's indoor shots. canon's shots look much cleaner, brighter, and sharper than my kodak shots (in the same room with the same lighting). the S2 is a more expensive but canon also sells an S1 which also has very good reviews on amazon. i recommend checking it out."
4,unbeatable for the money,"i am by no means an expert but this camera continues to impress me. easy to use, not too big or too small and the prints from the printer dock have wonderful color and clarity. using the digital zoom can take some getting used to only because it is hard to hold the camera still enough without the use of a tripod to get a clear pic. i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a digital camera with top end performance with mid range price, printer dock is well worth the money. more than enough features to keep you busy for a long time. i love it! i cannot believe i lived so long without it."
2,Bad long term battery life,"I have had this camera for about 2 years and really loved it until recently.In the past few months, the battery life has gotten shorter and shorter. A trip to the mountains proved disasterous when my camera, with brand new duracell photo batteries, died after about 5 pictures.Not a good camera for long term use."
2,Wouldn't work for son's graduation,"I've had this camera for a year and a half only taking pictures periodically. I took it on a trip and was only able to take 2 pictures before the battery told me it was dead. I thought I might have not put it on the charger correctly. I was sure to put the camera correctly on the charger to prepare for my son's graduation. When the moment came to take the picture at his graudation the battery was dead. I have a friend who also had the same problem and we bought them at the same time. So if you want a good camera for a year and a half, this is a great one. If you want one longer, it'd be best to look somewhere else."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I received this as a Christmas present. This digital camera works fine for still shots, pictures of my family, etc, but for action shots, kids playing outside, basketball games, etc. it is a BIG disappointment. I took 47 pictures of my son playing basketball in our school gym and only 5 of them were worth keeping. I've taken to several games/activities to try it out. I've tried using the different functions, adjusting the manual setting, and playing with the zoom but nothing has worked. Many of the shots are blurred, have shadows (because of movement), or are so dark the people can't be seen. I wish I would have known this before I asked for this camera."
1,BIG MISTAKE!,Buying this camera was a big mistake as it went bad within one month of extremely gentle and almost non-existent use!
3,Still a work in progress,"So far, I am very happy with the quality of the photos, but I haven't really had much of a chance to use the zoom. I'm still trying to get used to all of the different settings. One thing drives me crazy and that's the lens cap! It will not stay on, no matter what I have tried. But I can't say I wasn't warned, one of the othere reviewers had the same problem."
3,ok so,"this camera is okay. it has reallllyyyyyy good zoom, but some of the pictures, the background is just black. and if you use the ""capture subject and background"" it almost always comes out blurry. maybe mines just messed up. but yeah so hopefully im getting a new camera. but still keeping this one for traveling and stuff. because the landscape feature is excellent. i wouldnt suggest this camera for every day use. but its pretty good. BREAKS EASILY IF DROPPED. dropped mine the first day i got it. it broke, but i was sent a new one for free. i've used the neckstrap ever since."
5,The Kodak camera that loved the UK,"What that title means, is that the camera stayed behind inEdinburgh, Scotland as my husband and I caught our flight home. But we are getting it back.The review I would write is that the camera is very easy to use. We loved using it for our two weeks in the U.K. We just happened to leave it behind. We found the camera to have some unique and wonderful features, such as the camera adjusted the picture when it was used sideways. A great camera for travel. I can't wait to have it back!!!!!"
5,good one,a good product for the price that was quoted and its speed helps the beginner SLR cameras to save the images fast and ready for next shot.Worth purchasing one... but the delivery was too late and it was through USPS for that they charged heavy amount which is very bad.
4,4GB Transcend works great on a D80 Nikon,This card was shipped with my Nikon D80 warranty. I've shot in JPG + NEF combination with no problem. I reformat the card on every load. I'd buy it again especially at $95
1,Unreliable SD Card,"I have to agree with the previous negative reviewer. I've had the card for about 2 months. At first I was thrilled with the capacity, but one day it just stopped working. Now it will not work with any of my devices or my computer. Tech support admitted that the card is only supported by about 10-20% of the items currently on the market that use SD cards, and that it can operate inconsistently or fail when used in electronics that do not support this new technology. I wish they had disclosed that upfront, since upwards of 80% of the electronics currently on the market are apparently incompatible. The company said they would replace the card, but that I might have the same problem again. I think that this is a great idea (4GB) whose time has not quite arrived."
1,Not compatible,"This card was recommended as an accessory for a Panasonic TZ3 camera on Amazon. It is not compatible as the Panasonic requires SDHC compliance. Testing with a Nikon Coolpix camera, it allows writes, not reads, a big problem. Check carefully before selecting this product for a photo application!"
3,"Works in camera, not in laptop","I've used the card for a few days in my Pentax K10D and it seems to work fine, but the SD reader in my HP laptop will not recognize it. Nothing happens when I insert it into the computer. I bought this card because it was NOT specified as SDHC, which my laptop will not read, but apparently it's the same, so beware before you buy."
3,Does NOT Adhere to the SDHC standard,"While the card works on some (if not most) devices I have seen reviews of, I must say that it does NOT work on the Panasonic Lumix FX50 or the FX01 (the ones I have tried). So I would use caution with this card if you can't find a review that specifically states this card works with your device. I've bought a Panasonic card that specifically states on the card that it is SDHC compliant (and it works). At the time of writing the Panasonic card is $60 more expensive that this one, but it works.The card does not adhere to the SDHC standard and therefore might not work in some devices (such as my Panasonic :S Anyone wanna buy an 4GB SD card btw?)"
1,Stay away from this company,While the memory card is great stay away from thememstore.they HAVE POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND BAIT AND SWITCH ROUTINES.
3,not good for replacement for a regular SD cards,work fine as a storage device with any card reader/computers but not all digital gadgets take it.
3,something else,"i ordered this one and it took forever to get it...but its not Amazon's fault, it's the USPS...."
1,Cero compatibilidad :(,"Compre esta SD junto a mi camara LUMIX en EEUU (yo vivo en Chile), en pocos minutos me di cuenta que no la reconoce mi notebook, mi camara y mi PC. Solo en mi Ipaq 4700 pude comprobar que tenia 4Gb. Ahora no se como la voy a usar o si definitivamente la remato. Pesimo el producto y pesima la informacion de compatibilidad en AMAZON."
5,Relevant and Timeless,Prophetess Bynum delivers the Word with no holds barred. I just now viewed this DVD in 2010 and it still pertains to life today. I have no regrets in making this purchase.
5,No More Sheets,I cant believe I have not seen this before. All single women should watch this DVD. Not a bad idea to share it with your daughters. I plan to gift it as often as possible this year. Listen to the message don't worry about the trails and tribulations of the messenger.
3,"Good book, but can be confusing...","This book works, for most cases. I needed to know how to setup SMTP information. This book only focuses on WWW anf FTP in the IIsSiteManagement section. But the code shows how to GetObject for an SMTP server but not how to use the SMTP server. Same goes with NNPT. Otherwise this is a very good book. The examples are easy to follow and more important can easily be manipulated to your needs. My suggestion for a future revision: include everything, don't leave information out and put hints the code."
5,Excellent Source for ADSI Code & Nature of Operation,"This is the best book I have used so far on ADSI. The book presents a huge amount of sample code, objects, properties, and methods which act as a source for developing scripts to manipulate network objects. The data is not only provided in Visual Basic format, but also in VB script format. Many underlying priciples of how the code works and what parameters must be met for successful implementation of ADSI scripting are explained. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Zero to Hero,This books is good book for those that are know nothing about ADSI.Suitable for all level users.Have a lot of VB samples but not C++.The explaination about the process is very good and can understand very fast. I strongly recommended for all Scripters to buy this book for your future reference...Enjoy reading and testing... .
4,"Heavy on examples, light on theory","Basically this book takes the MSDN SDK on ADSI and provides examples of all the methods available for each interface. This provides the reader with many excellent code snippets that can be quickly applied. However it's light on the theory behind the COM calls and how to expand the code for further use. I was able to follow all the code fairly easily because I had already read Simon Robinson's book ""Professional ADSI Programming- Active Directory Services Interface"". My recommendation for those who really what to get a good understanding of ADSI and Windows 2000 that you read Robinson's book first. While some reviewers criticize Simon's book as being too wordy I found it very helpful. That being said this book will get you going relatively quickly..."
3,moving on to weaker material,"There is no way to give this 5 stars. That rating belongs to the stooges at their peak. Here we see Curly's decline (as even the five star reviewers admit). So how can this be rated five stars like the fist four volumes deserve?And then we move on to Shemp. Shemp is not bad, but he is no Curly. Theaters and even television stations have shown marathons of their material, and a common gimmick is to show ""All Curly"" episodes...because Curly is the best.So in summary this volume is not five stars but maybe 3 1/2. Still a worthwhile purchase as there are some gems mixed in....but not the consistent excellence of the previous volumes."
4,"Curly's sad exit, and Shemp returns to the team","At long last, Vol. 5 is being released, bridging the gap between two great comics. These final handful of Curly shorts are sometimes painful to watch, as Curly's health continued to deteriorate. Some were just not up to the same level of the earlier ones, and it's obvious when Columbia tries to ""cover up"" Curly's illness with clips from past shorts or ""Curly"" body doubles. It was a sad fate for such a gifted comedic talent. As Moe once said of his younger brother: ""He was a talented comic; a genius in his field"". Well put, Moe!The good news: Shemp returns! While he's no Curly--he never tried to be!--Shemp is terribly underrated. Even when the material is slight, he's a very good comic who can hold his own.This stage was an important transition for the team. And this particular volume should be interesting to watch."
5,Please Release On DVD All The Three Stooges Films,"I enjoy the later short films of the stooges, too, made & released into the 50's and shown on TV. The actor who replaced Shemp wasn't quite as slapstick as the others, but he was okay in his own right and the films are still fun to watch. Also, it's enjoyable to see actors alive today (or recently deceased) playing bit parts in some of the later Three Stooges films."
4,"Late Curly, return of Shemp","Like Volumes 1-4, the quality of the disks from Columbia are amazing. The shorts however are from a rather sad period where Curly was sick and eventually had to retire. There is one good short ""Three Little Pirates"" where Curly seems to be more like his old self, but for the most part, the others are pretty weak with only occasional sparks of their previous brilliance. Not recommended to introduce anyone to the Curly years. Try volume 2 or 3 instead.The good news, however, is that some of Shemp's best shorts are here: Brideless Groom, Squareheads of the Round Table, The Hot Scots, Heavenly Daze, Sing a Song of Six Pants-- and they have never looked better.For years Bridless Groom circulated in terrible public domain copies, but here it looks like it was just released yesterday.Thanks Columbia, you really got it right."
5,completely satisfied,"my order was delivered promptly and a day or two ahead of anticipated schedule delivery. The dvd,s were of very good quality and bought me back to my childhood days when i used to laugh for hours watching these funny characters. Thank you"
5,The only volume that will contain BOTH Curly and Shemp!,"This review is for the CONTENT included on this volume, rather than the production. I have all the shorts included here on VHS and I can only applaud Sony Pictures for releasing these shorts uncut, unedited, and remastered for the first time on DVD (Bravo Sony, Bravo). As other reviewers have mentioned, even though Curly's health was declining toward the end of his career, I still enjoy watching any Stooge short with Curly or Shemp. Personally, I would've liked to have seen the pic with Moe, Larry, and Shemp looking at the train passenger (played by a retired Curly with hair!) in 'Hold that Lion' as the main cover pic, but at least they included it in one of the smaller pics off to the right hand side. If the production quality of this volume is as good as the others, I very much look forward to watching. Keep'em coming Sony!"
5,Three Stooges at their finest...,This dvd collection contains some of the finest and funniest episodes of the Stooges career. I was very satisfied with my purchase...
5,Another first-rate volume of Three Stooges shorts.,"Eventually, I assume, that, if you collect all of the volumes you will have a complete collection of the shorts of the Three Stooges from 1934 to 1958. And in the best quality anyone could ask for. As good or better than they were when they were first shown in the theaters. With a predominance of crap put out today by the big studios go back in time and re-live the geniuses of yesteryear."
2,Waste of money,"I purchased several of the Dancing With Stars workout videos - all a waste of monies. These workout tapes have no real instructions and are faster than the speed of sound. As instructors, surely these people know that they should be turning AWAY from the viewers with their backs facing the students. When the instructors face toward the camera, everything must be learned in reverse. High hopes dashed!!"
1,Cardio? Are they kidding me?,"I purchased this DVD looking for a fun, challenging work out. What I got instead was an annoyingly hard to follow dance number that didn't even make me break a sweat. I could have burned more calories cleaning my house.I am in my mid-twenties and hit the gym about three times a week for 45 minutes of cardio. I would rate my fitness level pretty average so I think for the average person, this DVD provides little to no cardio workout."
1,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this, but found it difficult to follow, nothing is really explained, the instructors lack the personality of other Dance off the inches instructors such as Jennifer Galardi and Kristina Milanova whose dance dvds are great fun and I love."
3,Dancing with the Starts Cardio Dance,"If the buyer is an intermediate ballroom dancer, this CD may be appropriate.There is very limited instruction - few details. It is expected that we learn by watching fast moving instruction, right into quick moves. There is no instruction for foot positions and because the dancers are wearing work out clothing covering their entire leg it's difficult to determine degree of knee bend.It's entertaining and I loved watching Maks' moves through the entire CD.If it's instruction one may be looking for, this is not the CD to purchase."
3,dance moves,"Video is good, but it goes through the moves very quickly so it takes a few watchings to figure it out...it takes lots of practice to be able to do a routine from begining to end!!"
2,Doesn't live up to my expectations...,"I'm a huge fan of the show and really amazed at how great the pros look. I did the workouts but I didn't feel as though they were high impact enough to make me sweat or feel the burn. The moves were fun to do but no properly broken down, but the pros just jump right in without proper instruction. The camera-angles don't help either. The freestyle at the end of the workout was more like a filler for the dvd to reach an hour, you just pretty much watch the pros dance around. I bought Edyta and Alec's Fitness With The Pros...TEN times better! I think DWTS-Cardio Dance is more of a franchise sale for the show. Not a lot of thought was put into it."
5,Dancing with the Stars Cardio Dance,"This is a well put together workout video with great warm-up, cool down and fun dance moves. The set is attractive and so are the instructors, especially Maxim with his long legs and swivel hips. I'm sure the gentlemen would like Kim as well. All in all, very attractive video."
3,"Fun, but why so fast?","I too found this DVD lacking instructions. I would have actually enjoyed ""learning"" the dance before going right into it. I started off with Ashley's Cha Cha but after awhile of hearing her voice, I couldn't take it and switched to Kym and then Maks. Sorry Ashley, hearing your high pitched ""and back, and back"" was to much to handle. I had the most fun with the Paso Doble with Maks. Maybe after hearing Ashley's sticky sweet voice it felt good to ""stomp"" it out of my memory. :)"
4,Fun and challenging!,"This is a great tape. The workouts are separated into sections by style of dance, each about 10 minutes long, plus separate sections for the warm-up and cool down, and a ""challenge"" section where they combine everything you've learned about all 4 styles of dance. It is FUN and kept my heart rate up the whole time! To anyone who thinks it's too hard to follow or doesn't know the dance terms that they throw around, give it another shot. You might need to stop and watch them for a few beats to get the hang of some of it, but it's all pretty easy."
2,Not so fun.,"I really did not like this workout. In fact, I gave it to my sister after using it only once. It had little explanation of the moves. If you have a dancing background, it would probably be easier to understand. The only positive is being able to look at Maks. Other than that, it was worthless."
5,fun challenge !!,"I love DWTS and dance salsa a lot. This DVD is super fun. After doing it 7 times (and replaying some spots) I don't know all the moves yet but it keeps me interested, it's a fun challenge. As for benefits, I thought I was in okay shape because I play a lot of soccer, but the dancing works your thighs and lower abs well. This additional leg strength should help me with footwork on the dance floor. I was most surprised that the instructors are very pleasant, even when you're doing the DVD day after day, and their sassy-sas attitudes might help me out of my shell too."
3,"Not terrible, but not good either","I bought this video because I was curious about the content and because I like to dance and could always use a good workout. I was a bit befuddled with this one as I was never really sure what was supposed to happen or what was going on - either from a cardio or dance perspective. I could follow along with most of their moves only because I've learned them by taking lessons and using other videos, but I'd not go as far as to say the instructors did a good job teaching. At best, you can get a few fun and unique small workout routines, but this isn't something I could see someone using again and again."
2,not what i expected,I though it would be more fun music. It was just background and not at all the fun music that they had on the show. It was as if they didn't want to pay the fee for using real music. Also the steps are not taught well. Over all I was disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.
3,Way too fast,"I agree with the other reviewers - the steps went to quickly and were never explained well. However, I did find the steps fun, and its overall its a great workout. I think if you watch it a few times and do as many of the steps as you can you will eventually get the hang of it. I will certainly use this tape again - I felt the ""Workout"" in my buns and thighs for two days afterwards!!"
1,Not For Beginners!,"Sadly, this Cardio Dance Instruction is not for beginners. I have some dance experience yet, everyone needs some direction and instruction with new steps or routines. There are basically no instructions for the moves here and they progress so rapidly that even in slow-mo it's pretty difficult to follow these dancers and get the routines down without a lot of rewinding. They really missed an opportunity here to ""do it right"" and inspire. Would not recommend this DVD as it's too disappointing."
3,Fast and fun be prepared,This is a great DVD with all the dancer you love from the show however if you don't pick up dances quickly or don't have dance experience it will go pretty fast for us beginners. I still like the DVD even if I can only do the first dance and warm/cool down portion of it.
2,cardio workout dancing with the stars,This workout is tough if you are not a dancer. They move quickly through the steps without and instruction. It would be great for a dancer!
2,very difficult to follow,This was quite disappointing! The instructors go too quickly & don't explain the moves step by step.
2,Dreadful Music,"I think everyone else has covered the dance aspect of the video. My problem with it was the music, especially the Latin. I need to ""feel"" the music to be inspired to dance well and this music was lame. With so much music to choose from, I don't understand why this awful music?"
3,Not as much fun as a real dancing workout,"Unless you know a bit of dancing , this might easily scare you. I found the movements to be too fluid to grasp immediately. And the steps are more repetitive, which is good when you are trying to learn it the first time, but soon gets boring."
2,Lacks Instruction!,"I bought this DVD hoping to have a fun workout. I got very frustrated with the lack of instruction in this video. It's very difficult to follow. Also, one of the female instructors has a very annoying voice! If you decide to buy it I suggest turning the instruction off since it's useless anyways. By the way, I'm a coordinated person. I dance a lot and do taebo and yoga. I haven't had problems following along with any other videos. I would return it if I could! I don't even want to sell it to anyone else...it's that bad!"
4,Dancing with the Stars,"I was surprised at how winded this workout makes you. I liked it very much, but wish there were more than 4 dances. You do need quite a bit of space for a couple of the dances, and sometimes you might want to rewind, and play in slow-mo, but a great workout nonetheless. I love the show, and it was fun to workout with the dancers, especially Maks (one of the reasons I bought the dvd)."
1,Very disappointed in this video...,"As another reviewer stated, ""I had high hopes for this video; too high, perhaps"". That is it in a nutshell. As a fitness professional, not only was there no breakdown on how the moves were performed, the choreography did not take into account the fact that the vast majority of home exercisers do so on carpet, not on wood or linoleum floors. I would say that half the moves are unperformable on carpet and pose a high risk of injury to your knees if you try to do so, especially in the Paso Doble and Jive portions of the video. The ""routines"" were not really routines, just a series of steps performed in a particular style and, with the exception of the Jive, did not raise the heart rate, nor keep it raised, enough to give any real cardio benefits. Top this video off with Ashley's incredibly annoying, squeaky voice and I would say that there are a lot better ways for you to spend $10 to get fit, even if you get to stare at Maxim while you are doing it!"
3,good movement but lacking in instruction,"This is not a bad workout video, it's just not quite up to snuff when it comes to previewing or breaking down new moves. The instructors essentially name the next step and then do it, without the benefit of a holding pattern for someone who doesn't know what a ""New Yorker"" is (it's basically side cha-cha). I did enjoy the personality of the instructors, but if I wasn't already familiar with the some of the dance moves I would have been totally lost. By the time I got through the four 10 minute routines, I had zero patience left for the improv bonus dance. If you are not an experienced dancer, I'd recommend the Dance of the Inches Series, which breaks down the steps very well."
2,disappointed,I was highly disappointed with this DVD. The dances are good but they really don't teach you the steps they just show them too you. Also they don't give you enough time to learn them before they move on to the next thing.
2,More of a demonstration; no real instruction.,"The steps are named and presented while the dancers are doing them at full speed. There really is no instruction. You just have to watch the steps and try to follow along. Their black leggings made it hard to see exactly what their legs and feet were doing and the camera angles never really focused on that, either. The footwork is somewhat complicated and just too quick to follow. My next attempt will be to play a short segment, pause the DVD, practice some, and then move on to the next step. Also, many of the moves require twisting your body or ankles very quickly and I can see a possibility of easy injury. This might be a good workout for someone more accomplished at aerobics, but who wants to learn a new style. It's not for someone who wants to learn to dance."
3,Dance video,This tape is pretty good but the instructions are quick. Sometimes they aren't videoing what you should be doing at the moment so it takes longer to catch on what is going on with the feet. The challenge part especially--you get no instructions--just follow.
3,Not for the beginner,"This dvd has a good warm-up section, but the rest of the exercises are very quick and for an advanced person."
3,Disappointed,"I love DWTS, so I bought this video, thinking this would be great...Maks was the best as far as instructions go...but I've never done ballroom dancing, so I think they all could have given better instructions....I think it would be fun, if we could learn at a slower pace... I don't think it is for beginners."
4,Katherine,"I have been looking forward to this video coming out and definately enjoy it. I can see how it may be hard to follow for some, but if you continue to use it regularly you will learn the steps and can use them when you are out dancing! I agree it doesn't have the ""Pizzaz"" that someone mentioned that you expect from ""Dancing w/the Stars"" but it is a ""workout"" video, you're not performing. I am an amateur dancer who competes in pro/ams and I enjoy this video, it brings me back to the basics and just a plain good workout that gets your body in shape without having to think about ""perfecting a routine''. It's a great workout video, don't give up on it too soon! Give it a try, it's fun and definately gives you a great workout!"
3,"Not bad, but kind of cheesy...","I expected more of a high-end production, and was disappointed that it didn't have an ounce of the slickness of the TV show. This has an amatuerish feel to it overall, especially the music. They could have spent a few more bucks and made it more enjoyable to dance to, rather than use this lame canned stuff. I'll get tired of that part of it quickly. I'm not a dancer, but I don't have a real complaint about the lack of instruction. It wasn't difficult to follow, as it seemed to be the basic moves you see on the show week after week. It does seem that the flow, at times, didn't flow very... flowingly. A few distinctly unsmooth moments, like they didn't rehearse enough, or were just improvising. The three stars are likeable. Stacey will intimidate ANYone with that figure of hers! I just wish she'd pull up her pants a little! I'm sure this is the first of many installments of videos from this show. Hopefully, the next ones will be more polished."
2,"Fun, but not the best aerobic workout","These workouts were fun to learn, but they are not a good aerobic workout for those that are already in shape. For those beginning a workout reimen-it's a good start though. I was hoping that they would teach a full routine, but they really don't. So, the different moves are fun to learn, and it's fun to try to do with friends, but if you want a serious workout-this isn't it."
2,"super fast, no explainations of moves","I had high hopes for this video; too high, perhaps. As another reviewer stated, the moves do go pretty fast after Maksim's part. My biggest problem is that there are no real explainations or instructions of the steps, the instructors just say, we're going to do this now, toss in a dance term, and then they do it. I had such a hard time trying to figure out what the steps were by the time I sort of figured it out they had moved on. This workout would probably be a good workout, provided you understand the moves and can execute them at the speed the dancers on the video can. I found it to be too frustrating and will have to be desperate for some exercise before I pop this in the DVD player again."
1,Total Disappointment,"I am a HUGE Dancing With the Stars fan and the moment I found out about this workout DVD I raced to the store and bought it. It turned out just to be a way for them to make more money, not a way to whip your body into DWTS shape!It starts out with an upper body Paso Doble workout. This may be a workout if you're over 65 or severly out of shape because I didn't find it elevated my heart rate at all.The improvisational section at the end was terrible. Each star took a turn adding dance moves in but they didn't explain them and you could not follow what they were doing.The Jive and Samba sections in the middle were ok. Afterwards I didn't feel like I'd gotten a whole body workout. I find the Biggest Loser DVDs to be much better.Save yourself the money and watch the Stars on TV - where they belong."
2,At least Maks is good eye candy....,"I am pretty good shape and love to dance, but this was hard for even me to follow! Ashley and Kim are decent teachers, but the choreography was not the easiest to learn. I didn't feel like I got a good work out. Kind of a disappointment."
2,ok product,"I had purchase this product for my wife, she only used it once said that the work out was to hard for her. That the instructor's in the movie were going to fast, so her review she would rate this a 2 out of 2. the only good thing is that it arrived on time."
3,ehhh,"All around not too pleased. I didn't really start watching the show until this past season- maybe if you know the instructors better you'll enjoy it more? I found the brunette so terribly annoying that I turned it off. I'm not sure what her normal voice is, but her instructor voice is very cheerleader/Valley.I didn't find this tape particularly exciting, or energizing, and I didn't say ""wow, that was a great workout, I have to do that one again!"" Oh- and you'd better have a LOT of workout space at your leisure."
2,No mercy...not for beginners,"I have recently begun to watch DWTS re-runs on BBC America and I thought that it might be fun to try some of the dances they do. It wasn't fun for long! They move so fast with very little explanation! It starts out like your average exercise DVD with a ""dancers warm-up"" but then it seems to quickly become a really long dance-off between Ashly and Kym. Maks (who I think was the one to come up with the idea for this DVD) seemed to want to keep it slower and toned down, but it wasn't gonna happen. The concept of this DVD was *great* but perhaps Maks should have chosen different co-instructors. Ashly and Kym just seemed to want to show off how fast they can do all the moves. Not so great for your average at-home exerciser. Also, Ashly's overly sappy voice can grate the nerves after a while. I wish I could recommend this DVD, but I just can't."
3,Hard to follow,"This, like most all dance instruction videos is done, in my opinion, backwards. You see the ""class"" behind the instructor but the instructor is facing the camera--if we are supposed to be part of a ""class"" to learn, the instructor should be facing away from the camera so a person can follow the moves and direction exactly--not try to duplicate it by seeing it face to face. I was hoping this video would be different. You never go to a dance class live and have the instructor face you -- you follow behind them. I was disappointed."
5,Best Workout DVD EVER!,"This is one of the most amazing and fun filled workouts ever! I first watched the entire DVD prior to doing the workout. I started out very slowly only doing one of the workouts each day. I think it's better than trying to do all at once especially if you haven't worked out for a while but hubby and I enjoy dancing to ballroom music, although we never took lessons, this DVD is very enjoyable and self explanatory in learning each of the workouts easily enough that we are able to pick up the steps. I think it's an amazing addition to anyone's workout! It's a lot of fun and makes you feel as though you are not working out but just enjoying it!"
2,really cheesy,"I did not feel like I was really getting a workout, and the choreography and instructors were really cheesy."
2,Pretty stupid,"I thought this DVD would be fun. It's got a fantastic feature that allows you to customize your workout, but I was really disappointed with the content. It was poorly organized, short, and not very fun. I bought it the day it was released and am already getting rid of it. Don't waste your money. If you want a great workout that's fun, get Carmen Electra's striptease workout. The best are 1 and 2."
2,disappointed,I was totally disappointed in this DVD. When I saw them advertise it on the show I was so excited. Went out the next day to buy it and watch it. I thought this is going to be fun but the sound quality was horrible and the steps were to hard to follow. They should show you very slowly and then speed it up as you go along like they do in my belly dancing and crunch videos. I hope the next DVD is better quality and worth my money.
2,don't buy it if you want to have some good cardio workout,"only in one dance which lasts only 15 minutes you get pretty a good workout, in others it's too slow, you even won't sweat, waste of money ... if you want to learn to dance, buy it, get some workout while dancing - no!!!"
2,Dancing With The Stars Cardio Dance,"Some of the dances were good, but it was either too slow and not enough intensity or too fast and too much intensity. The dance moves go quick, and some are hard to learn. More fun to watch than to try."
2,Far too hard!,"I was so disappointed by this DVD. It is far too hard beginners. It's too fast with minimal actual instruction. There are too many shots of the dancers from the waist up...we need to see their feet! Ironically, the hardest segment for me was the jive and I took swing/jive lessons for three years! I adore Kym but trying to understand her over the music is tricky with her thick accent and I have always found Ashley just plain annoying. Her voice is like fingers on a chalkboard to me and she's the one teaching the jive segment. Your $$ is better spent elsewhere."
3,good first time,This video was fun the first few times but then there's no variety and it gets boring because you're doing the same moves ever time you pop in the video.
3,Dance Experience Needed!,"This would give you an excellent workout...if you knew half of the dance terms used by the instructors! This workout moves at an extremely fast pace with almost no instruction on the different steps used. Remember that not all of us have taken dance before. A chapter with slowed-down, simple instructions of the dance steps referenced in the routines would have made a world of difference!This workout offers no alternative moves for beginners or people who need a more low impact type workout (lots of bouncing and jumping).If you are looking for a beginner dance workout...this is not for you!"
2,Simply an Rithym Work out,"I personally was dissapointed with the purchased, though would have some good latin dacing moves and tricks. The blond chick on the DVD can't dance, they can't intepret the proper SAMBA from brazil. So was simply a latin dance aerobic work out, which is still an innovation, but not what i was looking for."
2,Fun but not a great workout,This dvd is for people who already know these dance steps. Basically they dance and you're expected to follow. I probably burned some calories running back and forth to keep up though.
3,More instruction needed,"I love Dancing With the Stars, so I couldn't wait to try this new dance DVD. I enjoy the DVD, but it is going to take some time for me to master the dance steps. It is definitely for someone who has dance experience. For me, it was rather difficult to catch the dance steps, because very little instruction is given. I think it would have been a better dance video, if they would have slowed the steps down at first and explained them thoroughly, then taken it to the next level. But, I am giving it a three, because the dancers are amazing. After seeing the video and dancing along with them, it makes you respect just how talented these dancers are. Also, it must be really tough for the celebrities on dancing with the stars to do these same dances without any dance experience as well!"
2,Not what i expected,"I ordered this dvd to have a fun work out alternative and i found it quite boring. I didn't have difficulties following the steps but after the warm-up and paso-doble, i just went ahead and paused it. The dvd was extremely affordable so it is not that I am upset but it was definitely not worth getting it."
1,I just wasted $10....,"This is the most annoying workout ever. I just get so mad at how bad it was made. First of all, they don't teach you the steps, they just start dancing and expect you to follow them. In every dance, they're just improvising, they don't do a rehearsed choreography teaching every step. They just do this and oh! let's do that, and expect that everyone knows how to do the complicated steps."
1,Not for beginners!,"I bought this dvd because I enjoy watching DwtS and I love to dance myself. I am not, however, a professional dancer by any means and therein lies the problem.This is not an easy workout to follow if you are not a dancer to begin with. There was no explanation or example of the moves before they performed them. They would just say what they're going to do next and then do it with no explanation whatsover.I think this is a great workout if you have a background in dance or are patient enough to try to follow them. I'm giving it one star because it is good if you already know what you're doing but bad if you don't."
4,Fun,After doing this a few times I have come to enjoy the workout. The downsides are not enough explanation of the moves. My favotite is the Jive. This gets your heart rate up and is fun. I dont even bother with the bonus mix like other reviewers advised. This is not well cued or explained.
2,Disappointed with the dances,"I'm a big fan of variety and when I saw that this DVD offered 4 different routines (each 10 minutes), I thought it was a great deal. But, I ended up liking only 2 of the routines (jive and cha cha). Plus, the jive was really the only routine that got my heart rate up - I didn't feel like I got any type of workout with the other dances.Some of the dances were repetitive and there were times towards the end of some of the routines when I felt like the instructors were just killing time and trying to figure out what do to until the 10 minutes were over.Although none of the steps are explained, I picked them up after doing them a couple of times. But the 'challenge' at the end was WAY to challenging for me to actually follow along.In a nutshell, I was a little disappointed that I didn't get quite the bang for my buck that I was hoping for."
3,"Fun, but hard to follow!","This is a fun dance workout, with the instructions by the ""Dancing with the Stars"" crew. However, the instruction goes way too fast and are very hard to follow. I tried doing all the dances; however, I kept getting lost after the first couple of moves. My husband and I took a ballroom dancing class a couple of years ago, and I learned the Cha-Cha, so that dance was okay to follow (since I already knew some of the moves). But if you want this DVD for a learn-how-to dance and an areobic workout, then buy something else. I get an okay workout, I mean the dances are pretty good once you can actually get them down, but it takes lots of time using the DVD to do that. I am doing dance by dance, learning one completely (enough so I can do it without the instruction), and then moving on to another one. If they would just slow down their instruction, do it step-by-step, then let you do a good dance workout, it would be a lot better. Too bad, thought it was going to be real good."
1,poor instruction,"I love the dancing and workout combined, but this video does not provide the best combination. Maksim and Kym do a good job demonstrating their moves, however the cardio level is just too low to get the heart-rate to the target. Then here is Ashley, who has a high pitch voice and put in too much rock-movements which does not represent the ballroom style Chia-chia. Also Ashley calls out every step, and she is really talking way to much (with a high pitch). I have a hard time keeping her section on for more than 10 seconds. If you want to really learn some dancing movements and get the workout, this video is NOT the choice."
3,Decent cardio,"I workout almost every day and bought this dvd for days in between my harder core strength training workouts when I needed some moderate/light cardio. It is decent for that. It gets my heartrate up and is generally pleasant to do. I am not very good at following choreography, but I can follow most of this with only a few missteps. Choreography is not as complex as some other cardio dance videos, but the instructors could do a better job of explaining the steps."
2,Disappointed,I was a bit disappointed in this video - they are not very good instructors via a video and they never really put a whole dance together - you need a lot of room to do this video but it did get my heart rate up - although I will add that I havent exercised in 3 years so it doesn't take much. This is definitely a workout video for the beginner
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the video. They offered no explanations or instructions for the moves. By the time I thought I got it, it was on to the next one! I love dancing, and it had been a while since I'd last tried it, so I was very much looking forward to the video. I was also looking for something to substitute traditional cardio workouts one or two times a week. The treadmill gets pretty boring! Guess I'll have to find another one!"
5,"Soooooo, It was Alex!","Another great book by Ms Emery. Alex and Lanessa, who would have thought he would have tried yet again to gain Lanessa's heart totally. I guess Lanessa had to tackle some of her problems before she could totally give heart to Alex. I'd call Alex a very patient man, because he waited a very long time to have Lanessa in his life. I loved the whole story line. Ms Emery again shows us of a town with a social cast system that will get on anyone's nerves. And of course it was nice to have a update on Damon and Jade. Much love Ms Emery!"
4,one of the better and more interesting translations,"this is an enjoyable, intersting and illuminating edition - taking the translation of Tao to a new level of understanding. The use of contemporary English gives the Tao a greater elegance. If you are interested in the Tao de Ching - you should read this edition. It is unusually readable"
2,Tai Chi for Seniors,This unfortunately is recorded on EP Extended Play VHS and thus is poor video quality. The program is good. Too bad the picture quality is bad.
5,"Rich, full characters in only a few perfect words","Brilliant character development and revelations in oh, so, succinct stories. In just several short pages you learn worlds about the inhabitants of Mr. Bergman's tales. Sometimes dark, always compelling, these stories will be revisited regularly by the reader. If only they were longer!"
4,Good casual platter,"I purchased this to use with my Corelle, being I couldn't find a platter, made by Corelle, to match my set. It works quite well. Color is almost the same. Shipping was fast and items well packed. I recommend this if you are looking for something you can use on a daily basis and have a casual look."
5,Excellent book,I just couldn't put the book down until I was finished. It kept me guessing and then surprised me at the end. This has all the elements that go into a great murder mystery story. This book would make a terrific movie!
3,No mention of lead soprano?,"The front of this CD (and therefore amazon.com) mentions only Fritz Wolff, the great heldentenor who sang the male lead, Henriette Gottlieb, who sang the secondary role of Ortrud, and the bass Otto Helgers. No mention is made of Beate Malkin, the Russian soprano known as Charles Munch's 'pet' who sang the female lead role of Elsa. She is listed on the back of the CD and in the notes, but a search of her name at amazon yields nothing. Since this is probably the only CD currently in print of Malkin's singing, this is a shame. I asked Johannes Gebhardt why her name was omitted from the front of the CD, but he did not answer that question. In addition, this is not the full Lohengrin, but an abridged version consisting of 8 cuts of patched-together pieces. The other 8 cuts on the CD are from other operas. The music is wonderful, but the packaging and credits leave a lot to be desired."
5,Fantastic versions of some GREAT songs,"Having read some of the other reviews I did not expect what this DVD had. Lake managed to perform some fantastic versions of many of the songs he is known for. "" Court Of The Crimson King "" was fantastic, especially as I had never seen a live version. He also did the best version of ""21st Century Schitzoid Man"" I've ever seen or heard, much better that even the original. My only criticism is that the kid on lead guitar tended to get a bit too dramatic & predictable with his posing & hair tossing about; two of Lake's classic guitar leads: ""From The Begining"" & "" Lucky Man "" were both overplayed. But otherwise, this was an unexpected great concert & I wish it had even more!"
5,Excelente trabajo,"Para los fans de E,L & P, este es un DVD que no pueden dejar de tener. presenta excelentes versiones de las más populares canciones de Greg Lake, incluso de cuando pertenecía a King Crimson.Sonido e imágenes de gran calidad.Lo recomiendo sin reservas."
5,A Must Have,"This is a great package. Not only does Greg have his voice back, but he's picked accomplished and talented musicians for his band. There are plenty of extras and each musician gets to speak about the experience and their backgrounds. Well worth the price for any Greg fan."
3,hard to find book,"This was a book I could not find in stores, so was delighted to be able to find it here. I received it i the condition described and in a timely manner."
2,Too limited,"Not that good. It is too limited for learning. It may be serve as a memory support. If that is what you are looking for, then it is OK."
5,Guitar and Reverb !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Saw this band live! If you like that deep reverberated guitar sound, then you'll love this CD. Obvious influence is Link Wray. Great remake of ""Apache"""
4,It has it all.,"I just watched this movie, and came away surprised that I had never heard of it before. It is well written, well acted, and uses both laughter and tears to create an engaging story that is delightful.At times, the different twists, turns and seeming incongruence in the story left me a little lost, but in the end the movie proved very satisfying.The film is especially good for those who love the Body of Christ, but are discouraged about what they see happening in their local church, or churches in their area.The film does not tie up all of the ends neatly, and easily gives fodder for discussions. It is not a perfect movie, but is definitely one of the more enjoyable newer Christian movies I've seen. Sometimes the music style is 'outdated' but if you look beyond that, the meaning is there.I recommend this movie heartily."
3,Worth checking out,I enjoyed the storyline of this book. I did find the writing style a little slow but I think it is worth the effort. It would be especially good for pre teens as it provides many opportunites for refelection. It express the growth of the characters well and you see them becoming who they are meant to be.
4,Looking For Life After Harry Potter?,"Are you looking for a decent story line after the end of Harry Potter? If so I would recommend this book. I am not saying that this book is as good as Harry Potter, but I am saying that it is a good book for the Harry Potter audience. This book has an interesting beginning, a solid middle, and an end that not only gives you a sense of closure for that particular book, but also leaves you wanting to read the next one in the series. The climax of the book in particular is very captivating. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to read simply to be entertained by the story line. I also wouldn't be very surprised if this book is turned into a movie in the next several years."
2,Big Disappointment after the Wind on Fire trilogy...,"After I finished the Wind on Fire trilogy, I couldn't wait for a new release from William Nicholson. Seeker really disappointed me because I consider The Wind Singer, Slaves of the Master and Firesong some of my favorite books. I only got to page 126 in Seeker before I just abandoned it. I couldn't even finish. I loved Kestrel and Bowman and Mumpo and Sisi and Pinto! Morning Star, Seeker and Wildman are all kind of weird and awkward and not as origanal. Espescially Seeker! He's just boring! I recommend you read The Wind on Fire Trilogy, it will not dissapoint."
1,Good intentions gone wrong,"Cirigliano provides some excellent critical and philosophical background to this masterful Italian poet, but he tries too hard to break with older translations -- which he finds dated. The problem is, in his efforts to provide an up-to-date text, he attempts to lend Cavalcanti's poetry a modernist and perhaps even avant-garde air that strips the poetry of its feeling and adds pretension in its place. His translation of verse number 51 (""Guata, Manetto, quella scrignutuzza"") is particularly awful, with his dryly academic and unhip use of ""cool"" slang that is actually awkward and outdated. He also manages to make ""Donna me prega"" unbearably pretentious. Better to go with Lowry Nelson Jr.'s version -- which features a slightly less insightful though bolder analysis and a much, much better translation"
3,Rich poetry--poor translation.,"Unfortunately, the other reviewer is correct in his estimation of the translation, which borders at times on infuriating. I consulted both Cirigliano and Lowry (who is flat, but accurate) while working through Cavalcanti in grad school, and compared both texts extensively with the original. If you read Italian, this volume can still be recommended as a handy, inexpensive edition of the original text; it's also an attractively produced volume. The translator's heart is in the right place; Cavalcanti does at times seem well avant la lettre. Alas, with two translations in as many decades, we're unlikely to get a new, better one anytime soon."
2,Helps but comes with a price......,"I wanted to give this 5 stars as it has been helpful, perhaps 2 stars is harsh, however I realized that since I began taking this I have gained 8lbs and it's been like 5 months. I can't lose the weight no matter what I do eat more, eat less, exercise more,exercise less. I came across some information online that said that taking adrenal extract can lead to weight gain and can also do some damage to the liver...and these include adrenal extract AKA real adrenals. I decided to stop taking these for a while and go back to taking adrenal health by gaia and praying that I will continue to have adrenal support while getting rid of this weight!"
5,Just ordered 2nd supply,"I tried this product based on the recommendation of my sister. After my initial dosage, I already felt some beneficial results and have now ordered an additional 3 boxes. Product came in a timely manner and is exactly what I expected. I am an Amazon fan because I know they will always guarantee my satisfaction."
3,Cancel Order,I would like to cancel my order. Please I no longer need this.The product served it purpose but I no longer need it.ThanksSherrie McConnell
5,A must for big cat lovers,"Probably one of the most interesting big cat documentaries I have ever seen and a must-have since watching the mini-series on Animal Planet. Dave Salmoni pulls off quite a stunt getting down on eye level with a pride of rogue lions who have been marked for extermination if he cannot quell their aggression toward humans. It is difficult to imagine what it must be like to be charged by three and four hundred pound cats, but Salmoni stands up to charge after charge to keep from reinforcing the aggression that threatens to put an unfortunate end to the pride.Surrounded by the natural beauty of a nature reserve deep inside Namibia, this documentary gets up close and personnel with the wild lions Salmoni comes to know by ""name"" and personality and sheds light on the inner workings of lion communal behavior."
2,More Lions,"I enjoy a DVD on Lions or Big Cats. This one I made a mistake on purchasing.(no fault on the seller as Quality was Excellent & Delivery Quick)I love to hear the story of the person who has taken the time and effort to make these type of movies, but this one leaves you wondering who the movie is about. There was too many shots of the commentator talking, moving closer etc than of the Lions themselves.I do understand that the people involved in making the movie want recognition for all the long hard days and nights, costs etc involved in making it. Recognition comes from a well made, presentation of the title, because of the presenter ever present I did exactly the same as when I watched this movie before purchasing it . Turned it off as it was the Lions I was wanting to see, not the presenter. Harsh words, yes but ......(I purchased this DVD through Amazon)"
5,"Cat Lover, Big and Small","Its hard not to rate anything that Dave Salmoni does anything less than 5 stars. His work with these lions borders on unbelievable. I've watched him on various shows on TV, plus his work with the big cats. He is just an incredible person. It is amazing to me how one can see the gentleness in his own more than usual strength, along with his intelligence in his field. He quite obviously has a wonderful gift with animals. I hope to see more of him on tv and in dvds."
1,Ridiculous Stunts,I have not purchased this DVD nor will I. I have however seen his silly stunts on TV and if this DVD does not contain the scenes when he sits with a large stick in his hand and it seems he is very close to wild lions please disregard this. If this is just a compilation of his TV shows than this is just him doing silly stunts. Note that they film him so it looks like he is much closer than he really is and you never see the crew around him. A DVD like this has zero value to anyone truly interested in big cats.
4,Blue Pages Tells a Tale,This is an interesting book. It gives those who care an insite into the politics of the corporations you are dealing with. In some cases the choice of company 'A' vs. company 'B' could be decided by who the company supports. Well laid out and easy to use.
3,Proceed with caution?,"Whatever your political leanings, you might want to hold off on buying this book until the dust has settled a bit. There is indeed a brouhaha brewing (ha ha) about this book over at Daily Kos:http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/2/10/114153/477#140"
1,Stolen from Buy Blue,"The original working title for this book was ""A BuyBlue Buyers Guide 2006,"" and it was to be written by the folks at BuyBlue. But in March 2005, PoliPointPress backed out of the negotiations and claimed that there had run out of time to complete the book. The publication of this book proves that they were lying.In addition, this book's methodology is very similar go BuyBlue's published methods.The most popular progressive blogger in the country calls the people at PoliPointPress ""scum."" Please don't support them."
2,Who gathered this info anyway....?,"While the idea of this book is great, and it can be used by people on both sides of the fence, it's questionable as to the validity of this information. The publisher and sources are pretty mysterious, and the book is obviously slanted to one side, as it's title indicates. IF this were a truly neutral publication, wouldn't it be called the ""Red & Blue Pages"" or something to that effect?I'm just not sure how accurate this information is, and feel that if people are gullible enough to believe its pages as Gospel, they'll truly believe anything - and probably vote accordingly!I'll look forward to a more neutral source printing something which is based more on hard evidence."
1,I didn't like this product,"I wish I could give this product more stars, but it just didn't work for me. I guess I was expecting a miracle product or something, so I wouldnt have to shave. But it was not meant to be! Oh well, I'll keep looking for the miracle product :0)"
3,giant book falls short,"While the book has plenty to offer, there are many activities that require ""every day items in your household"" that just are not found in mine. Consequently for my 3 and 5 year old this is my least favorite book. I consider it a good addition to a few others I have and it is fun to pick out things to do each season, but if you can't afford to buy several books, don't make this your only pick. Please note the key words are in the title ""more than 600"". With that many you are bound to find something for the occasion. The book is easy to read, is well organized and has good instructions."
4,Chess for my students,"This was a great books for my 1st grade students. Given I've already taught them all the values, moves, and how to win a game the book did get a little more in depth. Fun pictures and short explanations help a lot when explaining strengths of pieces and things. It did go over all the chess basics but could have given more examples and maybe a puzzle here or there to help w/ training."
3,Nice pictures and graphics - but not the best beginner book,"I got 3 books on chess for my 12th birthday. Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess, Chess For Juniors and Starting Chess. I give most of the stars because his book has great pictures and graphics. But, the amount that I learned from the written text was where this book was not so good. I do like this book a lot more that the Fischer Book, but my Chess For Juniors book was the absolute very best for a kid my age."
3,Colorful book in pictures but just ok in instruction,The book is full of pictures and neat diagrams. But when it comes to explaining things in actual words this is where I have a problem. I am a 6th grader with good reading skills. Sometimes things are not explained to my satisfaction. A little jumpy is the word I would use to say why I give 3 stars. But for pictures this book is awesome.
3,too broken up - nice lay out,It is nicely layed out with picutures and stuff. I found this to catch my eye at the Barnes and Noble store so I got it.But the actually reading material was hard for me since I am in the forth grade. I am an average reader but really good in math.
2,"non-returnable, please be cautious.","This equipment is quality built. However, I didn't see that it was the exact same part that already comes with the winch carrier, not the wiring kit for the rear of the truck that I thought I was purchasing and that would have expanded the winch's usefulness. I don't understand why it is not returnable."
3,didn't use it,"Well im stuck with this item. It is consider hazardous and you can't return it. All it is, is wire though. Not sure why its considered hazardous. My winch is placed at the front of vehicle and I don't put it on take it off etc."
5,"Excellent variety, energy, innovation, musicality","Up and coming Philadelphia Area band with massive potential. Album is a glimpse at the very live oriented nature of the band. Impressive instrumental interplay between musicians with superlative musicianship in all diciplines (drums, bass, keys, guitars). Very energetic, with room to spare! Improved vocals complement great music for this very impressive second album."
3,Live Trance Meets the Rock & Roll Studio,"The first thing to remember is that the sound that the biscuits have created over the years, can only be heard in their live performances. This disc has its moments - Vassillios is short and sweet but dirty at the same time - Aceetobee shows off Gutwilligs spacey reverb tone - and MEMPHIS shows the whole bands chemistry. This is the bands attempt at a rock & roll, in the classic sense, type album. The wild improv and thumping dance beats that Sammy and the boys lay out live is not seen on this disc. I think it's their best studio but if you don't know much about the band then get some live stuff too ie: 11-04-00"
3,It's pretty good,"Well, I ordered this thinking it was going to be as good as Phish. It isn't. It isn't bad by any means. It, just, wasn't a great all purpose album. It has some GREAT songs on there like Jamillia, Little Betty Boop, and M.e.m.p.h.i.s.. It just isn't phenominal or anything. If you like jam bands etc I do suggest you get this, though."
1,Ugh...,"Making Easy Money Pimpin Hos In Style...who the hell do these guys think they are?? dumb album, sounds like 8 year olds recorded it"
4,contagious grooves make you shake your money maker,"I heard these cats back in their Philly-only bar and frat days, and my oh my, how they have grown... while the album can't capture the live energy vibe (their instruments plug into your veins), this album still offers a whirlwind of sounds that take you in and out of hypnotic trance and pounding, knee-wobbling fervor... Acetobee has one of the greatest build-ups, MEMPHIS has a 'lil comedic thing going packaged nicely in a very catchy riff, I-Man has an almost crystaline beauty, and Vassilios gets super chunky-funky with (perhaps non-intentional but still desireable) off-note vocals. Buy this album or forever be left in the shadows of anti-climactic existential pain..."
1,If I were their mother I would hide..,An embarassing album full of songs that go nowhere and lyrics that make you prefer to hear fingernails across the blackboard.
4,Good value,"Our beagles are not as well satisfied with these treats as they are with others, as we find pieces unfinished in the kennel; however we still consider them a good value."
1,doesn't work; no return or exchange,"We have had this Motorola KRZR K1m LCD Twin Desktop Battery Charger for two months and now neither battery slot will charge the batteries. The vendor, Bargincell, will not replace it or refund it. Maybe there are many others that are having the same problem. It is discouraging me from ordering on-line."
3,Works but not very well designed,The LCD screen isnt all that. When you place the phone on the charger it muffles the speaker so it is very hard to hear your phone ring. It does what I bought it for (to charge my phone) but I would not buy it for any of the perks it list.
5,How to make a great movie in your basement,"This is a movie that meets all the criteria for a MM film and more.It is a precursor to the very good ""Flesh for Olivia"",one of Misty's best.The plot is simple (so they can't screw it up):Misty and her pal(Katie Jordan)hang aroundsomebodys basement getting high and smoking cigarettes but have no money to pay the rent.To avoid being tossed out on the street they perform sex cameos for some weirdo played by Joey Smack ,(an old friend of the crew of Factory2000)The sex scenes they play must keep upping the ante so as not to be boring and it finally reaches the pinnacle when Mr Weird wants to see a strangle scene where Katie becomes unconcious.In the final scene disaster occurs.So why does this rate 5 stars? Well,both Misty and Katie can really act,both are on the screen most of the time, the sex is hot,the girls look great and there are no sideplots or extra charactors to mess it up.It is direct,sexualwell filmed and kinky.It's that simple."
1,Don't Know! - Have not received yet!!!!!,I have not received this book yet but still am looking forward to giving it to a very special young lady who is very interested in horses as was my youngest daughter at her age!!!
5,Perfect for young reader,Very easy to read book and it provides the right amount of information for a young reader interested in horses
1,"MP3, playskool","Very disappointed with this particular item. It was not what I was expecting. My daughter never plays with it. It only plays what is already programed into it. I believe it would be better for 18months and under. Not something I would recommend for a two year old or older, save your money."
1,Waste of Money,This was a real waste. you cannot download any music to this thing. the ad was very misleading.....
4,My 4yo loves this MP3 pl;ayer,This MP3 player is great for my 4yo but my twin one year olds love it just as much. It plays a lot of different songs and my 4yo feels like a big kid. I would have given the product 5 stars if it came with headphones.
4,Complex and exciting,"I am a great fan of Mr. Stackpole and this book was great thrill to read. I took about one whole day and simply spent it in the wold of Tarrant Hawkins and his friends. Reality gets lost somewhere along the way and you get drawn into characters and events that you will never be able to forget. Now, don't be expecting exceptionally profound or difficult to grasp reading. Stackpole never claims to be writing great literature but what he does write is a wonderful story with believable, living characters and an exciting plot that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go till the very last page and then leaves you begging for more. If you are in the need of some good fiction or a little escape from reality, then make sure to pick up this book. All I can say is, I can't wait until the next one!"
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!,"If you like action, suspense, fantacy, and a lot of bloody war battles this is the book for you! This book has everything in it like the stuff I mentioned above pluss a great story and even a little romance, but don't let that discourage you, it doesn't take away from the book at all. If anything it makes it better. This book has a lot of great action and suspense that never stops through out the book. The characters are great and the story is fantastic. To me the ending is good and bad at the same time, which is definetly what Stackpole wanted. The ending is good because of being good and bad at the same time. That's the only way to explain it without giving anything away. Anyway like the ending or not there is a sequel coming out that will start a whole new series by Stackpole that I look forward to. I already pre orderd the sequel I like this one so much. So after all that if your a fantasy or Stackpole fan why would you not read this book?"
2,Barely Readable,"What can I say? I just don't think Stackpole is for me.This book had potential, I'll give it that much. There were two highlights: The first page and the last page. Let me rephrase that: The first sentence and the last sentence. Despite an interesting premise, this story just seems to fail in so many areas.The characters were uninteresting. The battle scenes were boring. The prose was mind-numbing. When the characters conversed, I didn't care. During the fight scenes, I felt like I was reading a grocery list.The coming-of-age celebration could've been so much more. The masked society is an appealing idea for a fantasy novel, but it is poorly executed in nearly every area. I wanted to like this book, I really did. But I can't.If the first 50 pages or so aren't for you, I'd suggest quitting the book outright. I wish I had only read the first sentence, the back of the book, and the last sentence. I would've been much more pleased."
2,an unfinished idea,"I've followed Stackpole through Battletech then to x-Wing, marvelling at his overall storytelling ability. Yet, The Dark Glory War has fallen far short of the mark set by his usual work. The language is plain, with fits and starts of detail and depth, wholly disappointing. The book is, however, still very good when compared to other writers. And new readers should definitely pick-up some of his other works."
4,"Gore, not hardly.","This book was great. It made me stay up half the night to finish it. When does the next one come out. Seriously, Stackpole needs to find a new cover artist; the picture on this one sucked. This book was pretty realistic when it comes to the battle scenes, and the way the main character gets screwed sometimes makes the book that much more hardhitting. Stackpole does a good job twisting you around with the politics. Smashing job!"
5,Could be the start of a new beautiful Saga,"Stackpole is better known for his Star Wars Novels. Yet he sometimes writes great fantasy. While the storyline in this book starts slow, it ends with a punch. I just wish that he would continue writing good original fantasy than those star wars books. He could be the next Robert Jordan if he just sticks with fantasy."
5,damn good book,I agree with one of the other review stating that it is very similar to the talion book.. its still a damn good book but i can see the similar style. I have a feeling that the series will be very good (in fact i ran out to buy the 2nd book as soon as i was done with this one )so i highly recommend it.
5,The Call - Off the Planet Good,"I bought this book at my son's request, and he is devouring it. I have also read this book many times, and it is off the planet good! This book is filled with divine revelation, which always goes to the heart first. Excellent book! One in ten-million!"
5,EN NOMBRE DE DIOS,"Adquiri este libro hace 4 anos, lo perdi y ahora lo quiero nuevamente, editado en espanol"
4,LA VERDAD SOBRE LOS PAPAS,"Muy buena obra sobre la verdadera historia de los Papas del Vaticano, Lealo y vera muchas verdades ocultas Lo lei prestado, ahora quiero el libro, si alguien sabe donde encontrar una copia jaimec7@ec-red.com"
1,"Just another biased book on the anti-Vatican ""best sellers""","The author is so biased by his own personal pre conceptions, that the facts are not use in a cientific way but just as an excuse to difamate the Vatican, the Popes and the Catholic Churc in general. Does not worth reading it! All he states as truth is just an interpretation -personal one- over the facts. There is no single piece of evidence mentioned that matches the truth about the conclusions, which are merely subjective to the author's opinion. The whole book is based on another book on the same theme, by a rebel spanish catholic ex-priest called ""Se pedirá cuentas"", that also is a merely subjective interpretation on the facts, based upon a non-proved fact."
5,An Amazing Book! Beauty so deep ...,"Photos so beautiful of trees so magnificent you are moved to emotion. Feelings of smallness overcame me looking at these trees. And feelings of shame at what we, the human race, have done to entire forests of trees. The UK for example, especially Ireland, once almost completely forested. What a loss.I cannot look at trees the same after this book. I always loved them, but now I can hardly bear to consider cutting any down due to thoughts of what they can become."
5,what a tremendous find,"When I first heard about this book I thought the idea was a bit silly. Well, the only thing silly was my premature judgment . This is a beautiful volume that showcases some of the most awe inspiring trees to grace the countryside of Great Britain. The photographer smartly captures the best of 60 chosen specimens, often including a human or two in the picture so the reader can grasp the magnificent size of these green giants. Pictures tend slightly toward the overexposed end of the spectrum so that maximum detail can be discerned. Each photo is accompanied by a brief, but informative description that makes each 'meeting' more meaningful. The only disappoinment was that not enough data was provided for those inclined to go visit these remarkable trees in person."
5,"Fantastic, my first choice as a gift","This is a fantastic set! The favorite disc of the three is ""The Book of Pooh,"" although the Mickey Mouse one is a close second. The activities are really fun, with great graphics and classic pooh-character humor and scripts. It was my daughter's first software at three, and now as a first grader she still loves it. My three-year-old son was able to teach himself the games and how to navigate the menus. He plays with it without needing any help. We loved it so much we give it to friends with toddlers, and when one of our discs was broken, we bought the whole set of three again."
2,Dull and overly slow,The Pooh for Toddlers is overly slow and extremely dull. It has narration like some Pooh cartoons but due to this it takes too long for anything to happen. If you have an active child or one that is very curious they will get frustrated at the length of time it takes before anything moves or happens.
5,Dead prof and stable matters,"The author has two passions - horses and literature - and he manages to mix the two into an intriguing mystery. Scene is a thinly disguised Austin and University of Texas. The chairman of the English Department is murdered in the mail room. I labored there long ago, and the campus ambience is unmistakable; so is the politics of a big faculty. There are large doses of good literature, plus the inside info on training horses for show. Well-written, with interesting characters and subplots. We hope there is another Rusty Coulter mystery in the works."
5,These guys are good!,"very good boy band! they sing great! ""This is our song"" is a beautiful ballad! Great boy band!"
4,art toy,I don't like being requried to write a review about the products I buy. Be happy with my rating only
1,Poor...,The Reese Towpower Ball Mount is a poor excuse for an adjustable hitch. The range of adjustability is limited and the welds had to be ground out to make the slide work at all. You would be well advised to spend 2 to 3 times and purchase a quality adjustable mount!
4,This mp3 player is pretty good for the price!,"I bought this I-Jam a couple od days ago, and everything turned out OK. The headphones arn't very good, and the 32 mb is pretty low. But overall this is a very good mp3 player."
2,"Interesting, but needs real editing ....","Having lived in Silicon Valley off and on since 1977 (I came out to join the now-defunct Ahdahl Corp) I found part of this book interesting/enlightening. However, the writing style meanders way too much; I had real trouble keeping my interest up (I kept reading on ""one more page..."" hoping it would get interesting, but ...Per the prose extolling the talents/background of the author I'd have expected a much more well written book; it just wandered from paragraph to paragraph and chapter to chapter. Maybe next time ..."
4,Fun book for kids,"I ran across this book in a local store and just reading the lyrics and seeing the illustrations, I knew my daughter would like it. Sure enough when I got home, she wanted to sing it right away. I do agree with other reviewers that it would be nice to have a CD, but it's still a nice book to share with your kids for years to come."
2,Where is the art?,This deck does not have any art whatsoever on the minor arcana. They are basically blank. Ordinary playing cards are more attractive. I returned it the same day to the store. A big disappointment to me as a big Merlin fan!
3,Want to understand Microsoft.....,"then you should read this book, because all the dirty tricks that IBM used in doing business are laid out and followed by Microsoft. The reading is a bit tedious but once you get by that you find interesting tidbits like the printer that IBM would install for one price, if you needed more speed from it they'd send out a tech who would futz around for a while, throw a switch which would increase capacity and you'd then be charged double. Microsoft follows this strategy in software with Windows XP Home and Professional, throw a switch and double the price, very neat!There are loads of other fun tricks that IBM pulled, can't remember them all because I read the book 5 or 6 years ago."
2,Ok at best,The music on a lot of the tracks sounds great but the singing is just over powering. On a lot of the tracks I had to turn the volume down when the singing began just to be able to listen.It's a shame to because this disc has potential to be pretty good.
4,Lots of fun for my preschooler,"We love 2 of the 3 CDs. The Phonics one is a bit dark (sorcers with mean faces, dragons, crystal balls, and pentagrams). Mickey Kindergarten and Pooh Kindergarten were really top notch. The Pooh Bear one is our favorite."
3,Pooh part was a big hit,"The kids really only played with the Pooh game. They still do in fact. The game is a resource hog, and frequently bogged down our computer, but it's an older system so...."
4,Disney Learning Kindergarten Bundle,"I don't really know where I stand on this bundle... My daughter really likes the games (she's 3). But I can only get two of the three discs to work with my Windows XP... The regular Mickey Mouse one wont work at all and the Winnie the Pooh disc says there's an error every time you change the scene, you press ""Ok"" and it continues fine, but it's annoying. The Mickey's Quest disc works perfectly, though. My husband says that there's a quick lil' thing he can do to fix these issues... but it's been about a month and he hasn't gotten to it... soooo.... =(Idk, I don't like it because of all the issues, but my daughter loves to play it."
1,Completely unacceptable,"Bought this and another Disney title for my autistic brother for Christmas but will be unable to him as they do not work properly and I'm afraid that will upset him. Whoever programed these should be embarrassed as they hardly work at all and go as far as to change your windows display settings which is bad enough but its forces it in archaic settings which haven't been used in over 10 years. For the titles that do work it takes forever for things to load which is unacceptable with such simple programs on a modern computer. I cannot imagine running them on a ""Minimum system requirements"" PC. With luck I'll be able to return these for credit and get another product made by someone else. Don't consider purchasing this."
2,there's much better available,"This is an alright book for absolute beginners, but not up to the standard of the many other books available. I would recommend 390 Traditional Stained glass designs by Hywel Harris as a much better choice."
3,It has some nice moments.,"This ballet set in a house and garden where the three sisters and their family lives. Its a series of short dances by individual or groups of dances in the garden while the rest of the casts are residing inside the house. There are nice moments but the overall ballet is disappointing compared to other Macmillan ballets. Darcey Bussell and Irek Mukhamedov doesn't really project the level of passion and intensity as a couple, like the choreography suggests. There is a short documentry on Mukhamedov's early days in the RB. It is very interesting if you are a fan of his dancing. There are clips from Spartacus and a couple of other ballets as well as an interview with him."
4,A Martial Arts classic!,"Looking firstly through the eyes of his students, and later through his own eyes, Stan Schmidt skillfully takes the reader through the process of starting to learn karate through to achieving black belt and beyond. Students at all levels will be able to relate to at least some of the experiences in the book."
3,Good Music.Irritating Voice,"Sorry but, the wave of joy that came over me the minute the guitar began to play was lost when Ali began to sing. I admit that he can sing and I'm growing more and more fond of his voice but the music suffers. The guitar is beautiful enough on this CD to buy. The John Lee Hooker like track at the end of this CD is worth the price of the album as well."
1,A technical delusion,"This doesn't look as having been shot in 1994! One can guess either the use of a primitive VHS camera, or perhaps a better one, whose material has been miserably transferred to DVD. With my SONY Handycam I an reach 10 times better results. AMAZON should warn customers on the inferior quality of this product. We are in the 21st Century now and even porn producing companies supply better material. A pity for the good models and good intentions of the producers."
4,Helpful,"This has been a very helpful book, helping me to gain perspective as a mental health professional into how the legal system views us. It's well-written and full of information I've never heard in any of my other classes."
2,illogical,"Wasn't impressed with the movie. The reasons the wetlands are disappearing, we're told, is lack of new soil being deposited due to levies, and the canals which bring in salt water from the ocean. The rest of the film we're subjected to watching the cajun musician and the fiddler zipping up and down the canals in their speedboats. Then, once Katrina devastates New Orleans, the film makes a point of noting that the broken levy, which caused flooding, had thankfully been repaired. For most of the film I was wondering, okay, so how do we save the wetlands? The answer, revealed at the end, is more man-made engineering. Okay. I give it two stars because the music overall was fun to listen to."
1,"Wetlands, not Hurricane","What a disappointing story! This video has an agenda, and it is NOT the story of Katrina. It is the story of saving the wetlands. That is important, but I didn't buy this video to watch the agenda. I wanted a story about the hurricane and its devastations."
4,Talented young woman writes so the very young can understand,"Kathy Noll has taken Dr. Carter's Adult lessons and turned them into an understanding concept so that children and adolescents both, can fully comprehend her explanations! She is a gifted young lady, and I know for a fact, that she has taken some experiences from her own past and implemented them into her manuscript. It's a GO, Kathy! I'm proud to acknowledge that she is my niece!"
1,Taking The Bully By the Horns,"Just common sense advice. Nothing new for adults or teachers to draw on. This would not hold the interest of the intended age group, in my opinion.Disappointed in the purchase."
2,i just bought three on ebay for twenyt dollars not a good buy !,not a good buy i just bought three for twenty dollars on ebay ! amazon can do better !
4,"There is a 5-star record in here, trying to get out","Enough great cuts to make the lesser ones bearable. For fans of Morrison's early-70s stuff, this is like finding an overlooked gem. The post-""Into the Music"" selections leave a little to be desired. But it is still great to hear him blow a few mean harp solos, and sing some blues like he used to do. I hate to live in the past, but at times this record sounds like the old days. And that means it sounds just great!"
4,Van's Greatest Song Is Here,"Buy it for The Streets Only Knew Your Name, the finest Van Morrison composition and performance of all time and one of the greatest songs I've ever heard. If you've never heard the forgettable version he released on Inarticulate Speech of the Heart, avoid it like the plague. If you have heard that, this version will make you forget you ever did.Rest of the record is quite good as well for a collection of outtakes, especially Madam Joy, Really Don't Know, and Mr. Thomas."
3,Absent From Previous Releases For a Reason...,"While a bad Van song is usually better than a good song by most others, it is not surprising that these cuts were left on the cutting floor. Truly magical moment are few (you know, the ones where song, vision and spirituality mesh.... Sweet Thing, Listen to the Lion, It's So Quiet In Here, etc...) Only one track came close and, frankly, I forget which one it was because I returned Philosopher's Stone in exchange for Dylan's Biograph."
2,mediocre,"I am a big van morrison fan of his 70's music. Some of his music is sheer genius and ""Philosophers Stone"" has some tracks from this period. ""Ordinary People"", ""Foggy Mountain Top"" and ""The Street Only Knows Your Name"" are really good tunes that were somehow overlooked for too long. This is not a great CD, but it does have some merit. Sadly, this CD surpasses anything Van has released in the last 25 years!"
3,1 disc worth of music on 2 disc set,"A few pretty good songs of recycled, unreleased Van Morrison. I particularly liked ""That Was a Wonderful Remark"". Not enough good music here to fill 2 discs."
4,Scuttlebutt review,"This is a very comprehensive explanation of the racing rules. Black and white, nuts and bolts, classroom style. This is not entertainment, but rather designed for those sailors who would prefer a more visual presentation of the rules over reading the rule book. - Craig Leweck, Scuttlebutt"
3,Racing Rules can give you a headache...,"Dave does a nice job with a tough subject. Even the most seasoned of our sailing club racers that have seen this rules clinic had to beg off after the first hour... Too much input ! Plan on screening this in short doses and repeat as necessary. Still, MUCH better than trying to understand the rules by simply reading them. Happy sailing !"
3,"Good explanation on the rules, but no use of images","David Dellenbaugh explains all the rules of part 2 one by one. He explain the definitions as it is used in the book.The explanation is good with a good level of detail. There are also some basic graphics too.I got disappointed by the on-water images. They did not bring anything new and I think they repeat a lot.So, this product is not a DVD. It is more like a listening book on TV."
3,"Well written, but...","Well written, but any man who treats women like the so-called hero does (sleeps with the sister of the woman who jilted him, then leaves her; gets engaged to a woman he doesn't love and while engaged to her, goes back to the heroine to ""get her out of his system"") is not hero material. Could've been so much better."
2,Mistress...and mother!,"Trish's body still tingled at the memory of her time with Adam four years ago, but he'd seemed more interested in dating glamorous women than settling down! Trish had vowed to forget him - until, gorgeously irresistible as ever, he appeared on her doorstep insisting it was Trish he really wanted....Surely this time Adam was here to stay? The passion between them was as thrilling as Trish remembered. But then a fax arrived from his ""fiancee"" - just as Trish was about to announce she was carrying Adam's baby!Review: This book had too many strange threads. The hero was married for 15 years to a woman he had a child with but never truly loved and had only married for teenage trauma. He met the heroine when she was 16, he was married and she was a border in the home he shared with his wife. He was twice her age at the time. Both main characters were in other relationships when the first slept together. Just a bit too much ickyness to make them compelling characters."
1,Found a better solution,I bought this battery and it only powered my laptop for just a little over one hour so I returned it and got my money back and bought a Novuscell brand external laptop battery from The Battery Geeks website which powers my laptop for over 7 hours per charge and also charges my iPad and iPhone.
1,better off bying extra laptop batteries,"I should have just purchased extra laptop batteries. For the price I could have gotten three laptop batteries. This ""hi capacity"" battery does not last very long. The battery my laptop came with last longer than this. I die before two hours."
1,Good for only one movie,I'm taking a 16 hour flight and need to power my laptop for at least 6 movies. I was disapointed that it was dead after one movie. The baterry that came with the Toshiba R705-P35 is good for 2 movies. I regret not buying two more Toshiba batteries.
4,An answer to my problem,"These labels make finding and organizing my CDs and DVDs easier. For large jewel cases, they fit perfectly. For thin cases, I used the dividers, but I'm not sure I was supposed to. I wish there had been instructions. At first, I just folded over the thick labels. But then I thought,""Are these going to come unglued?"" So then I tried using those little separators, but I had to cut the edges before I unstuck them. We'll see if I made the right choice. But for the thick jewel cases, they're right on. And I plan to color code, to make finding stuff quicker."
4,Cut a little narrow; don't order brown version,"Overall, these are nice, well made, attractive shoes. Two cautionary notes:(1) I normally order standard width, but probably should have ordered wide for these. They seem to be cut a little narrow over the middle and took a while to break in as a result.(2) Other than the width, I was very happy with these shoes and ordered a second pair in brown. The wide version was a better fit, but the brown shoes are so dark that they looked black to both me a and my wife. I returned the supposedly brown pair and went with a different model for brown shoes to go with khakis."
5,Great Shoe,"These shoes are outstanding. They are super comfortable and look great! They hold their shape, have a great sole for hard surfaces, and are at a great price! I highly recommend them!!"
4,Great shoe!!!,"This shoe looks great with a nice pair of pants and can also be worn with jeans. The shoes are comfortable to walk in compared to most dress shoes. In the few weeks I have had them they haven't gotten any scuff marks and still look great. They do get a crease in the area where your toes bend which could limit the life of the shoe, but it's not that bad so far and I suppose is something that happens in most shoes. They seem to be a very good, durable pair of shoes."
4,"nice shoes, wide size a little bit small.","Nice shoes, very soft, very comfy and you can wear it with jeans, slacks or even formal dress pants, I try it as other reviewers suggest it and looks nice, even do a competition with my Florsheim formal dress shoes. I don't give the full 5-five stars, based on the wide size, even I ordered Wide it was a little bit small than expected."
2,Way too shiny,These shoes would have been great if they weren't so shiny. I love Rockport dress shoes because they're comfortable. But these were not what I expected based on the picture at all. I returned them and bought the Rockport Wanigan. I couldn't be more satisfied.
4,"Looks great, scuffs easily.","I've bought this shoe two times, once at Off Broadway, and once on Amazon, both for around $80. The first iteration lasted me three years (wore them probably three times a week), and I only stopped using them because the scuff marks were too much to deal with. Since these are waterproof (they really are, and they work great), it means that shoe polish doesn't really soak into the leather. So, once you have a major scuff, you may have to start over with new shoes. As other reviewers have noted, it takes a while to break in the shoes, like any leather product. Still, it's a great shoe, and if you end up walking through puddles on city streets, you'll be really glad you have them."
3,What's the fuss about,"OK i have used these for two weeks, quality seems to be great, but nothing stands out...shoes are more shiny than they are in picture....plus they still did not break in and feel very hard on the ankles as you walk....i really want to like those ...i don't hate them but i still do not feel tempted to wear them in the morning."
5,Comfortable and versatile,"I've worn these shoes for three days now and with each passing day they get more and more comfortable. The great thing about them is they look great with slacks, Dockers or jeans. The laces are nice and thick and the soles provide a nice sticky feeling. Rockport has been my shoe of choice for many years and these do not disappoint."
4,"Not a lot of shine, but a LOT of COMFORT","I've bought a lot of dress shoes over the years, but I have NEVER felt more comfortable shoes from the first time I put them on. Not even a break-in period - dang and these comfortable!These shoes do not have a high-gloss high-dress type of shine like you might see on other Rockport, Florsheim, etc. modified wingtips. They're borderline casual finish. I don't care - I wear them with my suits. Good rubber soles are great on wet tile surfaces, high-gloss lobbies, etc.Did I mention how comfortable they are?"
2,These shoes are hot,"These shoes look good, but because they are waterproof, they don't breathe. Consequently they get quite hot when you wear them all day long. And sweaty feet in shoes that are waterproof can, er, start to smell a little bit. They also make a squishy sound when you walk. This is my experience anyway. These are not high quality shoes. I am buying a pair of Ecco's to try them out."
2,This shoe runs narrow,"I purchased the medium width shoe, which is all I've ever worn before, but it is very narrow and uncomfortable."
4,Great deal for the price,"I have very wide feet and was looking for some inexpensive dress shoes that I could wear not just to business meetings but walking a few blocks to the meeting, sometimes in the rain. I did not want to ruin a very good and expensive pair of shoes that way.These fit the bill nicely. They are wide and not uncomfortable (the leather is hard; not the glove-soft quality of expensive shoes, but then again at this price it's okay.)The sole and heel are rubber, but they are thin so the shoe does not like the thick-solded cheap shoes. Rubber soles can take the punding of walking on asphalt and cement without wearing out quickly like leather soles.And the shoe looks nice and dressy.For the price, this is a great shoe."
4,Comfortable Shoes,"Very comfortable shoes, very soft leather. Original pair I ordered were not wide enough for my feet, so I suggest getting one size wider than you normally wear. Other than that, very nice."
4,its good shoes,"The soes is good, i just all of a suddden need a smaller size, i think my foot shrunk :-)"
2,Not sure if these are 'legit' Rockport Evanders...,"I know this might be odd to say, but I'm not sure these are legit. Or perhaps they could be the ones from the factory that didn't make the cut.... They wear and fade differently than the other 10 or so exact Rockport Evanders I've had for the last 5 years (purchased those retail from Dillards). I'm not sure I'll be buying this shoe from Amazon again - something seems off about it."
5,"Comfortable, elegant shoes.","I ordered these shoes to use them in a very special event but didn't have the time to get used to them. So, I prepared myself to deal with the first time use problems but it didn't happen. They fit comfortably from the very first minute. I walked a lot that day just like if I would've been using my good old shoes."
1,Weird Air Pocket on Heel is uncomfortable,I received feedback that the air pocket on the heel intended to add comfort is irritating. The shoe overall is stylish.
1,Wrong color!,"You sent me a wrong color. The item number on the box is different in the shoe!So, remember to check it when you'll have it!."
2,not wide as other shoes,"Nice pair of shoes but I learned a lesson: Rockport shoes are not as wide as ECCO shoes, as an example. That makes for a clear lack of confort. I also wonder if they will last long as compored to other pair of shoes I own. Not sure that the quality I though I was paying for will be at the rendez-vous."
4,Rockport shoes from amazon warehouse,Im only giving this 4 stars because the shoes I received were not the ones I bought (rockport evander). I received a rockport waterproof- less dressy black work shoeI didnt return it because they did look and fit great. I recommend AMAZON WAREHOUSE only if you can stomach the chances of receiving wrong things from time to time.This is just one example. Last week they sent me a wrong video game- same title but wrong edition. They need to be more careful over there.
4,Solid shoe at a good price,"This shoe uses a very firm leather which is thicker than other Rockports I have owned. They are substantial shoes that feel very durable. I took me a couple of days of wearing to break them in. The soles are thick and supportive, yet still have a good amount of ""spring"" in them. The leather has a fairly high gloss."
2,Disappointed to say the least,"I ordered these from Rockport's website directly and was very disappointed to find the quality of these were lacking. When I opened the box, the polish was already noticeably gone in some spots. Thinking it may have been some leftover dirt, I tried to clean it with water and a cloth, and even more of the polish rubbed off. I gave it two stars instead of one because they were supposedly the most comfortable dress shoes (according to the person I bought the shoes for).Due to the polish already being rubbed off, I can only imagine what actual wear and tear will do to the shoes. So I will be returning these promptly.I really wish it had worked out, as I had high hopes for these after having read the reviews from the other people on Amazon."
5,great low salt seasoning,The flavor of this product is great. It is not HOT as one might assume cajun products are. Thanks for a great product.
5,Perfect Blend of Words and Pictures,"This story has so much going for it: delightful phrasing, conflict, humor, and a satisfying ending.I love that the story is told from a child's perspective. ""Delicious"" truly saves the day. Isn't that the dream of every child? ;-)The illustrations are the cherry on this story sundae. They're colorful, fun and engaging. Yum!"
5,Glad to see it in print,i so liked this book from the begining. i had the privilage to read it basicly page by page as it was being written (when i was 17). i am so glad to finally see it in print.it is a verry good young adult story that keeps a good pace and doesnt really slow down. if you liked the movie the goonies you will like this book
4,THE MOUNTAIN OF STONE,"I wanted to let you know that I have reviewed your books and I really enjoyed them! You can see the reviews here, http://www.kidsbookshelf.com/review.asp?author=d, they're the fifth and sixth ones down.Christina Lewiswww.KidsBookshelf.com"
1,Don't buy this book,"I found this 500-page book completely useless. The book doesn't have any (!) illustrations, it's plain text only, and it basically rephrases standard SAP OnLine Help. I found the standard SAP FI/CO Online Help more readable than this book ..."
1,Broken Promises,"The book just doesn't do what it says it will. It disn't tell me clearly ""why the world's most successful companies are usings SAP R/3's FI & CO modules: nor does it explain ""the methodology and technical implementation strategies associated with"" these modules.Look at ""SAP: and Executive's Comprehensive Guide"" if you want real answers to these questions."
2,Useless material,"FI/CO is most popular and CO is the key module. In this book, nothing is helpful. I am very disappointed. I do not understand what purpose for the author to publish this book. Perhaps the author is very experienced, but the book is really useless in this field."
3,Answers basic questions of SAP R/3's FICO capabilities only.,"If you are looking for a book on instructing you in the configuration steps in the FICO, this book is not the one to get. If you are in the early career development stages of SAP FICO implementation and are being badgered by other modular ""gurus"", with general questions on the FICO relationship with the other modules, this book will supply the general answers. Plus, this is a must-read for corporate executives that are considering SAP for thier company. CFO's and Controllers would benefit especially if they play a role in the final decision to do so. Guys, lighten up. Face it. There is no book available to show you step-by-step configuration-there never will be! A book of baseline configuration would be nice, but there are so many different variables in the customization process, that such a book would equal to 1000 Guttenburg Bibles!"
3,very exiting to read and get a deep knowledge about control,helpful to understand the logic of finance and controlling concepts. navigation are clearly explained.
5,Very satisfied,"We are enjoying this play yard so much. Recently we traveled to Mexico to see some of my family and we brought it with us,.. it is very compact and light to carry, also has wheels to roll it. The changing table which is attached to the play yard, is very heplful especially during nights when baby is half sleep and you want to avoid moving him too much (to other places too far from bed) to wake him up. Also you can set it up in a jiffy...which it's handy when baby is fuzzy and ready for nap.These days the play yard is set it up in our bedroom and it takes little space in a corner.I would recommend this as a good buy that would last long enough. Enjoy it!"
4,Great all in one Play pen,My daughter is just two months and loves sleeping in this play pen. The music along with the vibration is a nice touch.
5,"Strengthen your core, recover from birth","My physical therapist gave me this video to help me recover from the birth of my second son. These exercises are strengthening excercises designed to help you regain the muscle tone lost during pregnancy. I first thought they were too easy, but am surprised that I can feel the 'burn' after doing the video. It is not aerobic exercise, in fact, it is recommended you do some aerobic exercise in addition to the video. My son loves doing the exercises with me. He enjoys the attention and thinks we're playing. I recommend this video."
5,"This is now called ""Baby-Reps Postnatal Workout"" - & we love it!","This video's now available as ""Baby-Reps"" on DVD & VHS (I got mine direct from the infantastic site) -- I don't think Amazon even carries this anymore. I'd bought this original version on VHS, but once it came out as ""Baby-Reps"" on DVD, I got that one too (I prefer DVD). They also came out with a companion video - Dance-Baby-Dance Cardio workout, which I also got from the Infantastic site.I own a bunch of post-pregnancy exercise videos, and these are definitely my favorites. Lots of fun with my baby, and boy do I feel the burn!!!"
1,"Infantastic , Not what I thought....more like wastetastic","I am a new mom. I wanted to find a good video to get me back into shape. A friend heard of this video, I ordered it, and excited, put it in the player. I was shocked at how lame it was! I couldn't keep pace with the action, it was jumbled and not clear how to follow. My son didn't want anything to do with me when I tried the exercises, which most I could have come up with on my own. Oh well, I'll keep looking for the right mommy and baby exercise program."
2,An Editorial Disaster,"The annoying, chummy tone of the generally awful writing is the perfect compliment to the factual inaccuracies, typographical errors, and tiny type. A fair number of the required tutorial files were not on the CD, and are not available on the website.There's a great deal of useful information, but why wade through an error-laden bombastic text that's easily 20% longer than it needs be to get at it? It's a handsome text, but handsome is as handsome does.A good editor could have saved this book. Apparently Savvy doesn't employ any."
1,Dreamweaver MX / Fireworks MX Savvy,"If you are new to FireWorks MX and DreamWeaver MX, DON'T waste your time with this book. There are too many errors, inaccuracies and incomplete process steps. Plus, the CD does not have all of the sample files mentioned in the Hands On portion of the lessons.If you are experianced with FireWorks MX and Dreamweaver MX, nothing savvy here either. No new tricks, no great tips.Needless to say I was very disappointed."
4,Nice and simple,"This book is a nice simple overview of Halloween. My 20 month old really liked this book and all of its pictures. It was a great way to explain to her what Halloween and trick or treating is. Much too simple for an older child, but nice for a young one."
4,My First Halloween,My 2 year old grandson loved this book. It was a great way to introduce him to Halloween.
5,miscellaneous but gently,"This CD was realized as an STEREO SACD. I expect a MULTICHANELL, with separate six sources of sound. Initially I experied disappointment, but shortly, because the sound presents as great, clear and rich, DSD in fully brightness. Jazz performers, e.g. De Francesco, Sparks, Newman acquire a new quality during superb sound. Low price and high quality remove the question: buy or not? Buy, surely!"
1,AT&T - Stick to Verizon or Sprint,"Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible. Dropped calls, horrible 3G data.Stick with Verizon or Sprint"
4,Blackberry Curve GREAT Device!,"I call this a device because the curve is so much more than just a phone. I love being able to receive and reply to my work e-mail on the go. Working the net,taking and sending pics for both bussiness and pleasure. The curve is seamless moving between aplications to net to talking to e-mail, etc. It's so easy I'm even writing this review while sitting in the restroom! How is that for multitasking! I LOVE MY CURVE!!!"
2,Kinda Reptitive!,"Don't get me wrong, G-Spot was good and Candy Licker was okay. I do not like reading books that start sounding the same. It gets kinda old! But since my review is over Candy licker, let me review on that. Noire books are unrealistic, she is a good writer but she needs to try and connect with her characters more. Things that happened to Candy will not probably happen in real life. This book shows how young, fast A** women get caught up in the money and fast life with older men. Both of Noire's books were about that. Also how both of there moms weren't good mothers, they had a sibling that got caught up into the game with their ""Older men"", they both had a friend that was scandlous and had to watch out for her, they both got they A** beat by these sick men. So YES these books are the same scenario, different characters! I hope Noire's next book change clothes, because this chapter should be closed! If the next book is anyhow releated to these two, she will lose fans fast!"
2,LISTEN UP...,"FIRST OF ALL ME AND CG ARE NOT THE SAME PERSON... ONLY A LOW LIFE WOULD THINK ITS THAT SERIOUS TO SIGN ON AS SOMEONE ELSE! I DONT GET A DAMN DIME FOR THIS BOOK!!! IM SIMPLY BEIN REAL, AND I SEE SOME PEOPLE CANT HANDLE IT. WHO EVER SAID THE BOOK WAS BAD? I DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT NO BOOK CLUB CALLED R.A.W. WATCH YA MOUTH CAUSE U DONT KNOW ME!! WE ARENT THE ONLY ONES THAT FEEL THIS WAY AND TELL WHAT SENSE WOULDIT MAKE TO HATE ON SOMEONE ELSE?? ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE AN AUTHOR... MAKES NO SENSE. YOU POPPIN OFF LIKEYOU GETTIN PAID FOR THE DAMN BOOK.. QUIT BEIN A DICK RIDER AND KEEP IT REAL! NOIRE MUST BE PAYIN U THE WAY U ACTIN. U CAN CLEARLY SEE HOW SIMILAR THESE TWO BOOKS ARE. WHAT THE HELL IS EROTIC ABOUT HER WRITIN??? ""GIVIN A TONGUE BATH""... I COULDVE SAVED MY MONEY AND RE-READ G-SPOT. IF U LIKE IT THATS ALL THAT MATTER BUT DONT TRY AND PLAY ME FOR ""MY"" REVIEW. NEVER WAS A HATER.. MAYBE NEXT TIME WE WILL SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND I WISH HER LUCK IN ALL THAT SHE DO."
1,A re-mix?!!!!!,I was not impressed with this book at all! in fact I returned it back to the store. I am going to have to agree with the rest of the reviewers this sounds like a repeat of G-Spot.
3,G-SPOT PT 2(CANDY LICKER),"No doubt Noire is a good writer, but I read G-Spot and was like WOW!! read Candy Licker and felt like I was reading the same book over again. Although, I enjoyed both books, I hope that Noire changes things up a bit in the 2 upcoming releases."
3,I EXPECTED MORE,"AS OFF DA CHAIN AND MIND BLOWING AS G-SPOT WAS, CANDYLICKER CAN NOT COMPARE, IT WAS A CHEAP KNOCK OFF OF G-SPOT."
3,Cool Book,This was my first Noire book and I have to say this book had a lot of drama. I could believe all of the terrible things that Candy had to deal with!! This was a suspenseful read. I plan to read G-Spot next.
5,This was not G-Spot and never have I read an urban tale better....,And never have I seen people more envious of an author. Candy Licker was simply great. This book was nothing like G-Spot because none of the same things happened in the story. Candy Licker had all the twists and turns you want from urban fiction. I don't know what the last reviewer was expecting from an urban tale but if you don't like Noire's books why do you keep reading them? And by the way. You knew it was going to be some violence against women in this book just by reading the back of it. You realy really knew after reading G-Spot. Just because Noire wrote about it doesn't mean she does it. A lot of people write about it in almost all urban books. So why come on here just to hate? I bet you'll be reading Noire's next book won't you? But even if this was G-Spot that book was so good I can't wait for the sequel to come out and neither can you.
4,I can see the similarities but still stands on it's own,"I can see the similarities between this book and G-spot. However, this book still stands on it's own. This one was not at gorey in my opinion. I liked it alot and will continue to read noire's books. Can I meet a guy like knowledge?"
5,Thug Love At It's Best,"Lord only knows the souls that were taken in the House of Homicide with Hurricane at the reigns. I have never in my life read a book that broke down the industry like this. Candy was made to be a woman at a young age, and this story showed that the good guy always comes out on top. Although I felt that this book was a repeat performance of G-Spot, I liked the twists and turns, and the unexpected ending. Thank God for Knowledge because my girl Candy would've been done and over with. Definitely....every woman needs a Candy Licker."
5,A Serious Treat!,"All that I can say is that Noire's wrtiting and explicitness (if thats even a word)...grabs you by your heart and doesn't let go until the bitter end! Her writing flows like a movie! Although, her books are Urban Erotica, she's so much better than the more popular Zane. This book will make you want to cry, laugh out loud and mad at the same time! Excellent Read!!!"
3,Candy Licker,"Candy Licker was a much anticipated book by me. Noire is a talented author who has the ability to spin an erotic tale. She does the damn thing in G Spot and here if I had not read G Spot, I probably would have rated this book a little higher. However, this book was very much similiar to G Spot so much so that the book became predictable. It had the same plot as G Spot,. I am not hating on the author but for me as a reader, I can't condone a repeat. I wonder why did she write the same story. I am compelled to ask that of the editor. Why would they let her do a replica of her first story. And the story was a bit concerning, considerating some actions of the characters. Some parts of the story were left unanswered and never revisited again in the story. I loved GSpot but this book will leave you a little concern, like did I like it or didn't I.Yes, I would read another book by Noire, but with the hopes that the plot is different. Remember I am rating the book and not her writing ability."
2,G-Spot Retitled?,"I was really looking forward to reading Candy Licker because I thought that G-Spot was an excellent book. While reading Candy Licker I felt as if I were reading G-Spot all over again. The storyline and characters were so similar that it made the book very predictable and almost boring. The erotic scenes were ok but after reading both of Noires books I keep asking myself, what does he/she have with creating stories with such horrible violence towards women?"
3,this is not urban erotica,"Like others have said this book is very much similar to G Spot where the main character Candy is stuck in an abusive relationship. This is not urban erotica there is nothing sexy or sweet about the sex scences in the book they are plain old nasty (with the exception of the parts with knowledge and candy). The story kept me hooked and I finished the book in one day, but I really found it very disturbing for the most part. Now I wasn't expecting a sugar coated story, but you kinda get to the point where enough is enough. Even though the story was a bit much it kept your attention. I think Noire can write pretty decent, but I don't think she's worth all the hype. If you want urban erotica read a Zane book if you want sadistic ready Candy Licker."
5,Real Gritty & Grimey,"I have never read a book by Noire before. Today is my birthday and my sister gave it to me yesterday as a gift. I could not put this book down. It was that good. Finished it in a couple of hours. This is a great author and im gonna be sure to pick the other book "" G-Spot"" and anything that follows. This is a book you would absolutely want to add to your collection!"
3,Very good book,After reading 'G-Spot' I was expecting to be blown away by this book. And I was... after I stopped comparing it to 'G-Spot'. This book caught and held my attention and I loved it. I do like 'G-Spot' better and I think the reason is because 'G-Spot' is a little more risque with the sex.This book definately has the sex and eroticism but not quite what I expected. If you read this book it WILL be hard to put down because the story is VERY good! I wonder what goes through the mind of some of these people sometimes! I will look forward to the next book by Noire.
4,Captivating Novel,OMG!!!!I read this book in 2 days. I could not put it down. Noire kept it real. It sucks you in the moment you pick it up to read it. Great read for anyone.This was my first book by Noire but I can guarantee you it wont be my last.
2,Rerun,"This book was a bad rerun of G-spot. I wasn't at all impressed with Noire using the same basic format of: abuse, money, girl trapped, in love with another guy - in another book. It just seemed all too familiar. I was dissatisfied and felt all novels after G-spot was forced and lacked originality. I still think she is a good author with a lot of talent and potential. But the same ol' crack head mother theory gets old quickly."
2,misleading title,I did not feel that the title of the book justified the contents within it. It seems like the author gave the book its name only to capture readers of such material's attention. It was a great disappointment to me.
4,Good Book,"This was a good book. However, it wasn't as good as G-Spot but had a very similar pot. All and all, I enjoyed the book."
3,rose petals,"I do argree with cg and sunshine this book has alot of similarities as g-spot, and no i do not belong to a book club that goes around bashing authors i am simply givivng my pov on this book in which that is what this forum is for to give your POV. i would have like to have seen more put into the story of knowledge and hurricane being brothers she just gave us bits of this side of the story all and all i am a fan of norie and will continue to buy and read her books. once again this is just my pov"
2,I don't think so,"This is my first book I have bought by Noire and I am not sure if I want to buy another one. It just wasn't my cup of tea. The things that Hurricane did in this book was ""Scandalous"" to say the least. I liked the story but some of the things that went on were too crazy and over the top for me. I wished I didn't waste my $9.99 on this!"
3,Uhm.....,"I will admit, I am a little disappointed with this novel. I expected more for Noire as she was illustrated as one of the best erotica novelist. There were some sex scenes, but nothing that was descriptive, exciting or impressive, sadistic but not plain. The title the Candy Licker bares no connectivity to the heart of the book other than the main character's name is Candy.On the story level,it took me a while to get into it because it was a cluster of confusing blubbering back and forth scenarios for a while that left me with more questions than answers. However, the book eventually became interesting, so interesting that I could not put down. However, it let me down in the ending because the ending sucked and once again left more questions than answers. When I think of it, the book seemed rushed."
2,I Feel Disturbed And Sad After Reading This Novel,"I thought this was going to be an erotic novel. It wasn't. I was intrigued by the story and I read it in two days. I hope there aren't real women out there who put up with this type of violence. I can understand why Candy felt trapped but why did the other women stay and continue to be punching bags? Just for the money and lifestyle? Only one of them had kids so why'd they stay?The violence against women was just too much for me. I felt sick after reading this. This novel left me with so many questions:Why did the ""man"" set up Percy""Knowledge"" Jackson?Why did they frame him?Who would want to do something like that to him?Was it because he was black and brilliant they had to frame him????Why would a 15 year old boy need to get circumcised? That made no sense whatsoever!Based on this book I don't think I'd be interesting in reading any more of this author's work."
4,GREAT!!,"I ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK, AS I DID HER FIRST BOOK. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH IT IS THAT THE STORY LINE WAS A LITTLE LIKE G-SPOT. ALL TOGETHER THE BOOK WAS A GREAT READ. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
2,CHANGES,I PICKED UP THIS BOOK MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE COVER A I FIGURED HEY HER LAST BOOK WAS GOOD Y NOT.THEN I STARTED 2 READ IT AND TO ME IT WAS JUST LIKE G- SPOT SAME EVERYTHING.NOIRE PLEZ SWITCH UP YA STYLE
3,A high concept without a high dedication to clarity,"Wyrm seems to have been written with the novels Snow Crash, Foucalt's Pendulum and Silverlock in mind. What this means is that it takes one part high-concept social science fiction, one part conspiracy theory and one part sly reference to every book the author has ever read, and mixes it up into a very well-intentioned book. However, as the reader journeys to hell in this book, he will be walking on the many good intentions the author conceived of but never fulfilled. My main problem with this book is that the first half of the book is riddled with vague clues and plot hooks, which, later on in the novel, are either forgotten, blown off, or lamely explained away. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the RPG elements presented in the book alter the writing style significantly, and cause the book to develop a schizophrenia that clashes, rather than compliments."
2,"Well, It's hard to be fair..","Yeah, yeah. Wyrm gave some laughs, especially at the MUD parts. But it was not exciting, not interesting and certainly not remarkable. I found the later parts pretty good, but the plot was so ordinary, the character was flat and I always knew where the story was going. My advise is: Don't do as me. don't buy it. Because I for certain will not read any more hacker novels. Wyrm scared me away from those."
2,Let it go....,"I read the first 150 pages of this book in an hour. Turned the page and I thought I was in a different book! The technical aspects of the book were very well written, but it was very disjointed with the on-line gaming portions of the book. I thought I was the type of person that would enjoy a techno-d&d book. But this one was written in such a way that it was like reading two separate books. Beer and chocolate are two of my favorite foods, but not together. I feel the same way about this book. Get this one from your local library."
2,"Wyrm is lacking in good execution, it's slow and stilted.","Mr. Fabi reminds a little of Melville, going off on tangents that really shouldn't be part of the story. The descriptions of the world aren't very even, there seems to be a large disparity between the technology that's available and what is used. The writing is very hodge-podge, meandering through descriptions of things and seemingly bump into actions of importance. Overall a mediocre readIf you want good cyberpunk stick William Gibson, Neil Stephenson, Bruce Sterling, and Rudy Rucker"
4,"A fun read, especially if you know computers","This book was one of the monthly choices in our book discussion group, and I went into reading it with little expectation that I'd like it. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised and entertained, and went back to read it a second time. The book explored a variety of computer and FRP themes, and while there was some stereotyping, and some very predictable plot twists, on the whole it was an enjoyable read. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves computers and/or fantasy role playing."
4,Really makes you think,"I loved this book because it throws all of these really cool explanitions to religion, human nature, and other if lifes mysteries. It is also a really cool sci-fi and an easy read. Mail me with input if you like"
4,"The Sky is Falling, The Sky is Falling!","So sayeth the doomsayers and millenialists.The next millenia is approaching, (Dec. 31, 2000 according to nitpickers) and with it great disasters and upheavals. Among these is the Year 2000 ""virus"" and the mayhem it shall bring will be tenfold.Wyrm, set in the year 1999, addresses this so-called virus along with Artificial Intelligence, Worms and Viruses, along with a nicely detailed explanation of many internet tools and games. But amid this is a huge worm ready to bring the end of the world as we know it.With references to Deep Blue, and a wink and a nudge towards Microsoft, Wyrm shows just how vulnerable we are with our dependencies on computers.Besides all that, it's a great read with likeable characters and an excellent plot."
1,Quite possibly the worst book *EVER*,"Please don't even begin to compare this novel to other far worthier books in the genre (Neuromancer, Snow Crash, etc...). Mr. Fabi has attempted to take every single ""in-joke"" from the hacker/geek community and cram them into a single book with no regard for plot or characters. If, like me, you're a computer professional, with even a modicum of literary appreciation, you will cringe throughout the whole book."
1,"Frustrating, Horrible, and Never Worth Reading","Wyrm is an absolutely horrible book. To anyone I would say,""Never read it!"". As any one can figure out, the next milleniumbegins in 2001, not 2000, because there was never a year 0 and 1+2000=2001. Mark Fabi's little paragraph about how 2001 is mathematically correct, yet 2000 is agreed upon by the general population is like saying ""The general population believes that 2+2=5, and so it must be true! The only thing that Mark Fabi was trying to do was show off how much he knows about computers, and how much he can stereotype every form of life on this planet, especially women. The only good stuff is in the game; he should have just cut out the rest."
4,Well-written Glimpses into China,"These stories are very well written, and provide an interesting view of life in contemporary small-town China. They paint a rather bleak picture, so it is hardly a ""feel-good"" book. Not being a fan of the short story form, I was frustrated by the shortage of resolutions provided. I would recommend this to readers who enjoy short stories and/or who are interested in China today."
3,Horrible Packaging,"The product it self works as advertised and works just fine. However, the packaging almost destroyed this product. It came damaged and at first didn't work, I had to arrange the fuze to get a connection. It had been damaged on the end with the fuse and broke it loose from the unit. Packaging caused this review to be a three star verses 5 star review."
1,Not legal in US workplaces,One of the base contractors was using this transformer at a USAF computer facility (or one that looked a whole lot like it). The contractor's own safety inspector took a look at it and promptly removed it from the room and told the tech not to bring unauthorised electrical devices into the lab. Turns out there is no UL or other testing/listing label on this product and the tech's manager and Base Civil Engineering got a real nice letter. The contractor got a reprimand for an OSHA violation (because they are civilian contractors using unapproved electrical products). They are not happy.
3,the first modern american?,"Randall does an excellent job of telling Hamilton's story as well as describing his significane to the development of the new nation. As I read the book I was struck by how ""modern"" Hamilton was. His emphasis in centralized structures, efficient government and the significant role economics played in his political understanding. I was struck how Hamilton was more pragmatic than many of his contemporaries.Recommend this to anyone wanting to flesh out their understanding of the Revolutionary period."
3,A promising biography,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book, and the first two thirds of it did an excellent job of describing Hamilton's youth and his service in the Revolutionary War. However, like most of the other reviewers, I was disappointed with the inadequate coverage of Hamilton's pivotal role in creating the new country. I agree that it appears that the book seems to have been planned as something twice as long (which would have been a pleasure to read). For whatever reason, the author had to rush ahead with an insubstantial overview of the great events of Hamilton's life after the war. It's too bad that the second part of the book can't deliver on what the first part promises. Such a fascinating character deserves more."
2,just okay,"I read Randall's Jefferson biography and was unimpressed. However, I thought I would give Randall another chance with his Hamilton biography. I thought it was slightly better than the Jefferson bio.Then I read Chernow's Hamilton biography, which leaves Randall's in the dust. The main problem with Randall is that he is a professor and, as convential wisdom goes, professors write to pad their vita and for other professors, with little concern for the reader and more concern for quantity than quality. (In fact, with few exceptions [like J. Ellis], you should always skip a history book when the dust jacket announces the author is a professor).This book is an adequate overview of Hamilton, but why read it when an exceptionally better book exists? For completists and Hamilton enthusiasts only."
2,Poorly written,"As I struggled to finish this book, my only thought was to tell other people what a horrible book this was. It is very poorly written. The focus changes within a few paragraphs and the author goes back and forth in time in ways that is very confusing. Having read Joseph Ellis' Founding Brothers and David McCullough's John Adams in recent years, I was curious about Hamilton and how he antognized these two political opposites. But, as another reviewer pointed out, there is very little written about his last 10 years. There is a few paragraphs about Jefferson and Madison funding a Philadelphia newspaper to rival Hamilton's newspaper -- but there is never any mention of his starting or writing anything for that paper. His starting the New York Post rates only a sentence. I'm afraid I will need to seek out another biography of Hamilton to learn anything (besides his affairs) that occured after the Revolutionary War."
4,Good communication of established ideas.,"This was my first Schaeffer book, so I was unsure of what to expect. I consider myself rather picky with regard to religious subject matter. Mr. Schaeffer's book was enjoyable, and I will try another one. While ""Genesis"" did not really have any significant new ideas, it was well communicated and easy to follow, even for laymen or the casual reader.If you are unfamiliar with Genesis and the conservative approach to its interpretation, this is a good book. It is not scholarly or philosophical, in my opinion, but it remains substantial - which many people will find refreshing."
4,works,The fitings are nice. I used it to trouble shoot my vacuum lines on my truck. It has multiple fittings and they work well.
3,Adequate,"The gauge works just fine. The second or third time I tried to remove the vacuum lining, the gauge went flying out of my hands (about a foot off the ground), It is now permanently reset so it starts at 12 and ends up somewhere around 7. To sum it all up, it still works, but a very small impact is enough to reset your '0' point. Might be worth upgrading to a heavier duty gauge, might not be worth the money, depends on your application."
3,A so so love/drama book,The book was ok. It had it's moments also when it really stunk. The book grab some of my attention but it also bored me in some areas of the book. So over all it was pretty good.
4,Tour de force,"Why is Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" so much a part of the Christmas season every year? Probably because the themes Dickens worked with- anger, sorrow, regret, the power of redemption -are nearly universal to the human experience and particularly enter our minds in the Christmas season.""A Christmas Carol"" is an supurb re-telling of Dickens tale by Patrick Stewart, one of the finer actors in Hollywood today. As much as this is Dickens story, this is Stewart's moment. Playing every character in the story, Stewart turns in a tour de force performance that leaves you desperately wanting more.Believe me, you won't be disappointed."
5,incredibly good,"What can I say,A great book by a great author, who pretty much invented ""Christmas"" as we know it...Read by a Shakespearean Actor (he did very well with Star Trek too) with a great voice.A great ""read"" is now a great ""listen""."
5,A CHRISTMAS CAROL PERFORMED BY PATRICK STEWART,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMER i HAVE EVER HEARD. MR. STEWART BRINGS TO LIFE THE COMPLETE STORY. MAKING THE STORY MR. DICKENS INTENDED GO RIGHT TO YOUR SOUL.I HAVE PUT IT ON THE LIST OF THINGS WE ARE DOING FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY, THIS HOLIDAY SEASON AND TO SIT DOWN AND LISTEN TO THIS GREAT STORY.YOU WILL NOT BE UNHAPPY WHEN YOU BUY THIS CD.THE HALLEY FAMILY"
5,Excellent,This is soooo good I listen to it over and over - he is an excellent singer - absolutely love his music. K Wyoming
2,midwest,"usually like Guy Penrods work, but this Cd doesn't do anything for his image. I found it lacking and after listening a few times put it in the retired file"
3,more gaither-like,"Love Guy - but this seemed much more ""gaither-like"" than Guy singing. The audience clapping at times can be annoying."
5,I LOVE GUY PENRODS MUSICS ALONG WITH ALL THE GAITHERS,THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST MUSIC I HAVE HEARD . I LOVE ALL THE GAITHER MUSIC .
5,Outstanding Vocals,One of THE best voices I have heard in years. Sings from the heart and touches the one who is listening. Could listen to this all day. Will be looking for more CD's from this artist.
1,Keep Your Garden Train's Passengers Dry,"This Large Scale waiting platform is built in 1:24 scale, about half the scale of most dollhouses. It is meant to be used outside with Garden Trains, such as the AristoCraft Starter Set 28001. The style and scale matches several other AristoCraft structures, such as the Victorian Barn, so it will fit right into your Garden Railroad, whether you use it by itself or near a station.-Paul Race, publisher for Family Garden Trains(tm)"
3,Not quite right...,Would be a terrific product if the side walls were a bit longer...so that you could anchor them with bricks or whatever so cold air does not seep in.
2,Not the edition described,"The story and illustrations are certainly great. But this is now a collector's item and the version I got (2nd edition, 2nd printing, 2004) is not the October 1972 edition that I thought I was buying based on the Amazon product description. The more recent copy is not worth the big bucks I paid."
5,Just enough fantasy for the hero lover!,"My kids grew up with this, and other, George Suyeoka books but Momotaro was by far their favorite. Just the fact that a kid can come from a big fat ripe peach is fun not to mention the talking animals that help out hero Momotaro along the way. A wonderful way to teach respect for ones elders and responsibility for ones community without being too preachy."
4,dub tastic,"Awesome suns disc. SAme old electronic dub eastern fusion. The disc is very old but you cant tell at all i think like 79. It also has some irish pieces in it. Not my fav. suns but its up their. Check the other discs for my review. keep on dubbing. Fans of genetic drugs, twilight circus, samsara sound system, African headcharge, dub syndicate, laswell,"
4,WWII German Jets & Rockets DVD,"If you enjoyed Discovery Channels ""Wings of the Luftwaffe"" 15-20 years ago,You will love this documentary. Much new/old newsreel, and propaganda footageof the 'wonder weapons'. Very well done. A must for aircraft, or militaryhistory enthusiasts."
2,crap,this drum set is only for weak beginners it's un durable. I've put over $500 into it and it's still bad. save your money for a mapex.
4,Neck-snapping death/thrash,"2002's Inwards is the fourth album from German metal band Dew-Scented. To be honest, I picked this album out of a used clearance bin based only on the fact that Dan Swano was sporting a Dew-Scented shirt on one of the Nightingale albums. Given Swano's reputation, this band could have been just about anything, but I figured it was worth a couple of bucks to find out!As it turns out, Dew-Scented plays a very intense blend of death and thrash metal. Similar to The Haunted and Carnal Forge, they seem to draw from Slayer and At the Gates, but there's an almost Converge hardcore element as well. The result is absolutely furious metal, full of breakneck riffing, punishing rhythms and fierce growled vocals. There's a small dose of melody, but not as much as the average Swedish band.I'm glad I took a chance on Inwards. This is a great album for when speed and aggression are the order of the day, and it won't be the last Dew-Scented album I end up buying."
4,Get Thrash,"My rating would be more like a 4.5. This is a great album. If you enjoy bands like Witchery or The Haunted definitely do yourself a favor and pick this one up. The guitar is excellent in this album with riffs sounding similar to Slayer and even The Haunted themselves. The vocals are very cool, also along the lines of something like old In Flames and The Haunted. All around this is a great album and should be enjoyed by most thrash fans."
2,"annoying, not reassuring","I bought these to put on my windows and they worked great for the first few months. I checked them periodically just to make sure the alarm was still functioning. Lately, the alarm has been beeping in intervals, scaring me into thinking that someone is trying to break in. Besides the scare factor, it's annoying to hear a 90 decibel beep randomly throughout the house. I do not recommend these for use on windows at all. Even the chime feature wouldn't be good, say for children. It is VERY loud and not a pleasant notification that a door has been opened. It is indeed an alarm. It is a lot cheaper than a security system and if you can live with the random loud beeps, then go for it. Otherwise, your money may be better spent with different security methods."
3,Long on interviews; short on stand-up comedy,"Yes, it was great to see four lesbian stand-up comics. I wanted to see THEIR STAND-UP COMEDY ROUTINES!!! The interviews were well-done; there wasn't enough of their comedy routines, and that was disappointing. I'm glad I hadn't bought this DVD or I really would've been upset (thank you Netflix)."
3,doesn't support xD format,"from its description: ""...can read and write EACH kind of flash memory cards existing in the market now."" Sounds very promising, right? Well, there is one more memory card that exists in the market now - xD format, and this ALL-in-one fellow doesn't play with xD cards, which is very disappointed for me, cause I'm using this card for my camera. CompactFlash is working fine on it though."
5,Where's Pway?,"I love this album and I've been waiting for another pway album for 5 years. Will it ever come? Please pway, enough with the research etc. etc., make another hip hop album! we need you."
3,How much longer?,"It is now over a month after I ordered the CD and it still has not yet arrived. If it ever came, I might like it, but I can't tell yet."
5,Brilliant (but dated sonically),"You won't find too much material from the 80s that isn't dated in its sound, and this is no exception, as it makes heavy use of Simmons Drums, amongst other relics of the period. Also, the sound is more tropical (i.e. Caribbean-flavored as opposed to Cuban-flavored) than the rest of Los Van Van's catalogue (although it's still a definite specimen of Cuban music).The good news is that if one isn't put off by these things, this record will be an absolute blast. The better news is that even if one IS unduly put off by all this, it should still be great. Every track is a winner; and most are masterpieces (Sandumbera, Titimania, Calla, etc.) Brilliant songs and top-notch musicianship."
5,Skywishes,"Easy to dress, remove play objects, and great attention to detail. And how fun, playing the ukulele, something no one hears any more. The bird sits pretty well on horse."
4,A great book for toddlers,"This is a wonderful book for toddlers. Toddlers are naturally drawn to baby animals and this book is full of cute pictures of puppies at rest and play. Being a board book, our copy has lasted through many readings and perusals by our tots."
5,Truly the Father of His Country,"I just finished rereading this excellent biography of one of the great men in history and one of the few who genuinely cared about the welfare of the people he governed and put their needs above his own.C.V. Wedgwood's writing is a pleasure to read and she has a talent for making the historical figures she is writing about come alive. She also does an excellent job explaining the reasons behind the revolt of the Netherlands. Some of them are very familiar to an American. Her greatest achievement in this book is her three-dimensional portrayal of William the Silent. As I reread her description of his assassination, I could feel the tears running down my face, and that tells you just how vivid and descriptive her writing is.I highly recommend this biography."
5,how a single should be released,"H-I-M is by far one of my favorite, if not the favorite, bands of all time. their music is so emotional and melancholy, but so strong. this single is awesome, you know how you'd usually spend 9 to 11 dollars for a single that has the album version then the radio edit and nothing more? H-I-M knows how to treat their fans, this single not only has two of the album tracks, but five acoustic tracks, brand newly done. not some overdub crap. these guys are awesome and loyal to their fans as their fans are to them. the acoustics are a nice way to even soften up the already marshmellow melancholy tracks. enjoy!"
4,HEARTACHE HOLDS IT HIGH!,heartache every moment saves this cd!close to the flame reminds me of gone with the sin which is another low point for him.if you like him but don't want to waste your money go to www.heartagram.com and listen to the sample of heaartache very moment.if you like it you can download the music video for free off of singingfish.com!good luck!
4,Hmmm...,The very exact same track listing as the earlier-released Showbiz Kids compilation.Showbiz Kids: The Steely Dan Story 1972-1980
5,Great CD!,"If you're a Steely Dan fan, then this is the album for you. It has all of the band's greatest hits, and lots of great songs that never really got a lot of air play. This CD will definitely make you appreciate Steely Dan more than you did before."
1,Low Quality CD,The CD was delivered on time but it is deffinitely not high quality. The CD sounds like it was copied onto the CD from another source(perhaps a record and or another CD). There is a very brief part of a song at the end of the CD that sounds like one of my old records. Perhaps the person that made the CD forgot to delete the last track. At best I can rate this the lowest star available.
1,Be Ware,"After purchaing this software to change from Quickbooks, I learned the information in Quickbooks is not as easy to convert, and only converts names, etc. Also the customer service is also non-existant. After sitting on hold forever. I could get the software to work, kept giving me errors, keeping me in a continual look to keep entering information and than giving me an error. I sent the software back since I was unable to use and was unable to get the software update and tax update refunded. Be careful"
2,waste of money,"Interface is very difficult and tough to figure out.You need to be an accountant to make this thing work for you, and I'm not sure even if you are accountant you would wanna use this over Peachtree.I'm a small business owner and ended up buying Quickbooks after getting disappointed from this product.Save your money spend it on coffee or something."
5,"Cry hard, Cry fast",in the one fan of jhon mcdonaldi love this book beacuseim a seaman this story is about lin\ving at sea
2,Easy read but nothing more,"I did not find it to be a delightful erotic suspense as it states on the cover. Sex is boring, written from teenager point of view. There are no illicit details, no kinky explorations, and very weak plot. The end was obvious from first 20 pages. Since when masculine women wearing jeans and baseball cap became major attraction? Paul character sounds stupid, immature, and on the border of degenerative - you should be able to see it in his eyes, and do not make a handsome price out of him. This is second book of Larry Brooks that I did not like."
5,A wonderful spiritual guide,"I opened Voices of Wisdom at a difficult time in my life. It was shortly after my father-in-law had died and a dear friend had been diagnosed with incurable cancer. The section on death was a wonderful discussion based on the Talmud and commentaries that gave me strength and inspiration to help my friend. I was able to share the stories with non-Jewish friends, and also with friends who are serious students of the Talmud. I highly recommend this book."
3,IT'S NOT A BOOK- IT'S A PAMPHLET. AND A VERY BAD ONE.,"You folks should know that this ""book"" is really more of a pamphlet. It is only 48 pages long.I just received it today, and I haven't read it yet. I'm sure it will be as good as everyone says.It shipped quickly, too.But you should know that it really isn't a ""book"" at all, in my opinion. I'm not sure I would have paid this price for so few pages to read.******UPDATE*******Ok now I HAVE read the book, and ugh. It's pretty lousy. They establish early on that the girl is not possessed by the devil, but by demons (which they named). But throughout the rest of the book, they continue to use the term ""devil"" and ""Satan"" and ""Lucifer"" as the entity possessing the girl. Confusing.Scattered and abrupt read.If you are really hungry for well written, concise and clear cases of exorcism, read Malachi Martin's ""Hostage to the Devil"". THAT book is what most of you are looking for when you order this pamphlet."
2,True?,"Mmmm, a girl that floats to the top of a door and clings to it? Speaking, correctly, in languages she was not familiar with? Ok, we can not verify at all, today, whether Vogl's story here is true or not. makes for a good read, but we will never know if the events at this exorcism were real or told, as lies, to Vogl. Remember, Vogl was not there, but tells the story as told to him by others."
5,mind blowing book,"This book is the true story of a woman who was possesed by demons for many years. This is one scary read. What comes through most in this book is the unspeakable hatred the devil has for God. The hatred just leaps off the page. I saw the exorcist, but the real thing as presented in this book is incredible. At the end of the book the priest saw the devil and belezebub for a half hour,with the devil seething with rage at not being able to strangle the exorcist. I hope anyone who doubts the existance of the devil reads this book. It is truly frightening"
1,This is the SECOND thing that Amazon has NOT sent me! UGH!,Just like the title says.. I NEVER recieved it. I ordered a digital tire pressure guage a while back and that was also NEVER delivered. I'm never shopping here again.
4,worth watching,"This is science fiction. I like science fiction; therefore, I enjoyed it. I think the producers were on a budget. It could have been more detailed in presenting the characters. All in all I would recommend it. It is very well worth the money and the time spent in watching. Too bad they didn't do a second season."
4,"Original concept, well acted.","I fell in love with this series from episode one. A brilliant concept, high production values, and a great cast (Elle Fanning in particular seems every bit as good as her sister). The only real disappointment was the ending, which seemed as if it wasn't really thought out enough. However, it wasn't bad enough to stop me recommending the series to anyone who likes mystery and science fiction."
2,Awful ending,"This would easily have been deserving of a five star rating from me, if it was not for the awful ending. The last two episodes felt rushed, new plot threads were introduced and never resolved, and key questions were never answered. The ending did not make sense to me at all---it totally violated established rules of the story---and left me feeling as though I had wasted my time. Such a shame that this great show had to end so poorly. I would highly recommend this to anyone if it was not for the terrible ending. As it is, unless you don't mind watching a show with some great ideas that leaves you feeling as though everything is unresolved, then you might still enjoy this. I don't always expect to agree with an ending, but I certainly do expect for it to make sense and deliver some sort of closure. This did neither."
3,"Great mini-series, poor execution on the DVD","Somebody else has already given an in depth review on this, so mine will be a cliff notes version. This is a fantastic, intriguing story that had me begging for more the entire time. Lost Room... also a lost art. You just don't see innovation like this anymore in the industry in this reality TV age.But the execution of the DVD itself was poor, for reasons (again) already mentioned. They really dropped the ball there, and it's a shame."
3,"Good story but unfinished, DVD quality is a disaster.","I love the story behind this miniseries and the way it was executed. But why did they never finish the story??? There were too many questions left unanswered. Like so many things on TV these days, a good story goes by the wayside and gets abandoned. Studio politics? Suits ruin everything they touch.The quality that went into the making of this DVD was seriously lacking. The menu system doesn't work. You can't choose to just play the whole thing, you have to choose to play each segment of this miniseries and half the time when you try to navigate the menus they don't work. Quality control was non-existent for this DVD.Bottom line: Excellent story, interesting concept, captivating, this movie kept me wanting MORE, but I was extremely irritated that they never finished it. -kd5-"
5,Makes Me Happy,When things are reasonably priced and sent in perfect condition. I loved this series and now it's mine to own.
1,DVD Flaws,"While I enjoyed the mini-series during its original airing on the Sci-Fi channel, I was greatly disappointed by the quality of the dvd itself. The menu is reasonably flawed. The ""Play All"" function merely repeats the previews until returning to the menu screen. Also, the highlighting function which displays the menu choice you are making is frequently misaligned, causing you to select the wrong option.Also, the dvd only allows the ""stop"" function to be used while watching the program. You cannot stop the dvd from any of the menus or during the previews.I am aware that this is the only dvd you can buy of this program, but it is really irritating to deal with this dvd."
2,bad transfer,i feel the same about the tv show as the other reviews but truth is the transfer to dvd sucks the play all don't work and the video has some weird interlacing problems i would avoid this dvd till this is fixed
1,"Good concept, Nicely acted, Poorly ended!!!!","You will spend 5 hours watching a decent movie with an ending that makes no sense! And after investing 5 hours into the movie, they should have plenty of time to set up the ending correctly. I highly suspect that there was a different ending originaly, and then the 'suits' got their hands on the flick. To many loose ends also. I do not need every thing to be neatly explained to me, but I do need the movie to obey its own logic. Be warned!"
4,the lost room,this movie was cool meaning it has susupense and good idieas little corny but good entertainment with special effets that wasnt over whelming the movie
5,"Thought provoking, takes you away sci-fi story","In the 1960's, a lot of what we'd think are ordinary ""objects"" start showing up with very strange properties. The story starts when one of these objects becomes the property of a cop who takes a key away from a kid he's been trying to keep out of trouble. The kid tells him the key can be used on any door-knob, and he's not kidding! He takes it home to find that it not only works on a door to a closet, but it doesn't lead to his utility closet. Many other ""objects"" start turning up and can alter the properties of other ""objects.""A real mind bender of a story. A must for ANY Sci-Fi fan!"
5,Sci-Fi,I bought this mini series because I had missed the first segment when on TV. I was very impressed with this segment and had to know how the Lost Room was found. I would recommend it to any one who likes Sci-Fi. Very enjoyable.
2,"Loved the Series, HATE the DVD assembly","The idea for the series and the stories themselves are really imaginitive and well done. I'd love to see more. But the construction of this DVD by the production company is HORRIBLE! The menu doesn't work! There is a ""Bermuda Triangle"" startup session that you are forced to watch EVERY time you start this DVD or hit the MENU button to see the main menu. When you watch the first story it automatically plays the 2nd story as well, and when you play the 3rd it automatically also plays the 4th. If you try to go to the main menu to select an individual story you have to go back and watch the startup session again! Terrible job."
5,Great Story,"This is the best fiction made for tv movie I've seen. It kept me glued to the chair. The story line is exceptional, the acting was first rate, unlike many tv movies. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Lost Room""."
5,Wonderful Complement to The General Theory,"For those students reading Keynes's General Theory who are having a tough time, Hansen's book provides a clear explanation of Keynes's points broken down into a chapter-by-chapter detail. Furthermore, Hansen points out where Keynes was mistaken. Fifty years after it was written Hansen's Guide still continues to be a wonderful complement to The General Theory."
2,Switching to T-Mobile,I get no reception at home or at work in Chicago. The only plus I can make out is the rollover minutes. I'll be switching to T-Mobile soon.
2,"Free phone, but overpriced service plan",Cingular is the most expensive cell phone provider in southern california.
3,450 minutes go fast,"ATT customer service is so superior, I have to compliment every aspect of my contact with these people.But I gave up 1000 minutes with Tmobile for 450 minutes with ATT and free phone. Wow, time flies, I have to keep all calls very short!"
3,water repellent,"good for a while.....but if you scrub the shoes with a cleaner afterwards, it will come off so make sure if you use this dont clean them after. works great on boots i can stand in water quikly, and they come out dry pretty cool"
5,WOW. The best OES book I've seen. Perfect.,"Well, the American Kennel Club has found a book that merits it's seal of approval. If all of their breed books are this good, they'll put everyone else out of business. It is that good. Details about the breed, pluses and minuses, basics of training and healthcare, tailored to the breed. Just great. I would recommend this series to anyone who is a first time dog owner, or who wants a comprehensive book about their breed.I've read a lot of breed books, training books and magazines, have dog breeders and trainers in the family, and this is the best breed book I've seen."
5,Tons of Information!,The information in this book is easy to understand for an OES newbie:)Very helpful and informative!
3,Old English Sheepdog,sorry I have not finished it as my health went and I have not been able to get my favourite dog in the world and OES
5,Excellent value for the money,"I have a few cigar books. This one has proven to provide perhaps the most value for the money. It is an excellent, all-round guide to cigars."
2,Outdated Information,"Quality of paper, photographs and writing are excellent but the book is revised and copyrighted in 1997. More comprehensive information is available on-line"
4,I feel weird,"This film is a hidden gem. Eric Stanze really pushed the boundaries, and in some scenes crossed them. I am not giving it 5 stars because the acting was wretched. Although I have to give a high five to Emily Haack for putting up with that bulls***! This is a great addition to any horror collectors collection. Bravo Eric Stanze, Bravo!!"
2,The Idea Is Better Than The Movie.,"I read a lot of 'disturbing' reviews about this movie which peaked my interest. Needless to say, I didn't like this movie at all. The concept is interesting although it's a shame the writing and the acting are not up to par. I was expecting to see ""reality"" horror i.e. 'Irriversable' or even 'A Serbian Film' but I only ended up bored out of my mind and even fast forwarding through several dull scenes. I was very disappointed with this movie. 'Scrapbook' should be scrapped."
1,BLAA !!!!!,"I don't know what to say, or how to review this dvd. I feel that I have wasted my money on garbage. I am going to be very very careful with my next purchase. So how do I FEEL after seeing The scrapbook? I FEEL BLAA!"
1,LOW BUDGET BORDERLINE PORN,"I love a good thriller, and i am all for some good old gore, but this flick was absurd. It had terrible actors, and was almost pornagraphic. I dont mind nudity in movies, and my son also like a good horror flick, but i would have died if i had let him watch this movie and he is 15. Nothing good about this movie at all. It barley got watched once and has been in hiding ever since. Dont wast your money on this movie, there a thousands of much better movies out there."
4,A REAL HORROR MOVIE !,"Eric Stanze's ""SCRAPBOOK"" is a great low-budget film that crushes the bounderies of reality horror! this movie is !SICK! & its definetely not for everyone! when this movie is over you truely question yourself weather or not you should have just watched it. now thats real horror! *YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED*"
3,Biond-o Belief,"I first read a review about 'Scrapbook' in Rue Morgue magazine. After getting up the guts to finally buy it, I can say the hype from the article as well as the reviews on various websites does not prepare you for what you are about to watch. This is a tough film to look at. That being said, it is a better than average horror movie. All the credit in the world belongs to Tommy Biondo and Emily Haack for really going all out. The realistic mock-documentary feel to the movie makes the brutality that much more disturbing. As a lifelong fan and collector of all kinds of horror movies, I enjoy and appreciate when a movie is capable of shocking me. 'Scrapbook' did it. It is a very well done movie worthy of a place in any true horror fan's library."
2,Pretty Darn Bad,"Basically what you have here is a director who seems incompetent and a writer without much skill. The actor/writer of the film is not doing this for anything other than his own depraved interests. Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of exploitation in my cinema, but this is utterly boring and self serving. I mean BORING. Even the 'rape' scenes were lame. By the end of the movie, you get the impression that Biondo and Stanze just wanted to treat a girl like a pig.Pros: Brave Emily Haak. She gives it an extra star for her fearlessness.Cons: cinematography, pacing, writing, editing, ACTING. There are more, I am sure."
1,"Even though I love this genre, this movie was bad...","Coming from a girl who loves ""Last House on the Left,"" ""Irreversible,"" & exploitation like ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" & ""Thriller: A Cruel Picture,"" I must say that Scrapbook was BAD! It actually crossed the line of cinematic fantasy, meaning you know its not real. Most pictures like this one, have an element of substance to them... like an actual story and plot. A plot where the action moves the story along. Not Scrapbook. It was just ugly for ugly sake. The actors & crew just wanted to shock. I guess it worked, and I recommend this for those who aren't shocked easily. But coming from a girl who loves her ""edgy"" movies, this one was just violent rubbish."
5,A teacher's perspective,"After nearly a dozen years of classroom teaching and countless read-aloud books, this book is among the Top Five. A must read!"
5,Great Upgrade,Like most people I had to upgrade my power supply to support newer video cards like the NVidia Geforce 8800. I was really reluctant due to being in the hardware business many years ago and experiencing difficulties when changing power supplies. I have to say that this product is amazing with all the connectors provided. It fit like a glove and I was able to complete the replacement in less than an hour. Great Product!
5,Extremely Informative and Insightful,"For someone with little familarity with the history of Liberia (and most African countries), I found this book both insightful and enlightening. The text is written in a very organized and easy to read manner. The insight into the political, economic and social environment really draws the reader in. Her story is exceptional and should be read by all interested in conducting any business in Africa."
4,Great Read!!,"Maddy writes a warm, but penitrating review of the life of her family, as well as the nation of Liberia.She gives great insight into the exploitation of Africa by the west. She makes recommendations that companies and individuals should heed as they work in this great continent.Her writing style is easy to read, and very to the point."
5,Delightful reading for anyone/required for entrepreneurs,"Anyone interested in biographies, history, entrepreneurship, or international development will find this book instructive and enjoyable. I happen to be interested in all these areas and for me the book was sheer delight. Particularly concerning entrepreneurship, it provides a very detailed and enlightening illustration of the challenges faced by a start up. After finishing the book I felt I had gained new perspectives as well as admiration for all the initiatives and attributes of the author."
3,Needs More Detail,We're told that Herod was an architectural genius but paranoid ruthless ruler but given too few details of either. Focuses more on archeologists and digs than Herod. The backstory needed an extra hour.
5,Why did they take it away?,"This is a glorious volume that reproduces, beautifully, some of the most stunning images of the mid-twentieth century, captured on what is probably the finest colour medium ever produced. Look on these works, ye digital photographers, and despair!Kodachrome, along with Technicolor, passed into the language as a byword for quality; sadly, it's now passed into history. I am grateful to the publishers of this book for producing a worthy epitaph.Great book Great bargain."
3,A Solid Effort!,"In this book, Ian Mitroff attacks problem-solving by defining the first step: asking the right questions. He shows you how to use critical thinking skills to find the right problems, frame them correctly and implement appropriate solutions to solve or resolve them.This book is thoughtful and well-organized, just as you might hope it would be since it teaches critical thinking. It is also well-written and well-illustrated, featuring numerous diagrams that illuminate better ways of thinking. Mitroff includes examples of well-known companies which have made major mistakes that cost millions of dollars because they failed to recognize the right problem in time. He also gives examples of companies that succeeded through improved critical thinking and problem identification. We [...] recommend this interesting book to all business problem-solvers."
4,Asks the right questions,"The book's impact was made at the end of the first chapter. There I read Critical Questions and tried to answer them. These weren't questions about the material I had just read, but questions about me and my organization and how we deal with problems. Subsequently, the end of each chapter brought more questions to work on.The book focuses on the problem solving process and the search for the real problem. Many management books solve predefined problems, which are good books, as long as you're sure you've picked the right problem.The book is a quick read, interspersed with graphics that illustrates the text. Part 3 of the three part book delves into systematic thinking and touches on Jungian analysis, personality types, 5 Ways of Thinking, and even 12-Step programs.As the saying goes, ""Identifying a problem is half way to solving a problem."" This book will help you find the right problem."
2,Brevity and lack of focus hide a couple of good ideas,"About the first 1/3 of this book is a good, if brief introduction to systems-based problem-solving. The book focuses on taking a broad view of all aspects of the problem, not on a highly-analytical breaking-down of a situation. This is fine, though not earth-shatteringly good or original. Unfortunately, the middle half of the book is an unfocused meandering about the contributions of Hollywood to violence in society, and then to the problems faced in managing nuclear weapons. The last part of the book has a fairly good discussion of the four basic Jungian personality types, and how personality type affects problem-solving. This is pretty good stuff, but it is about the length of a magazine article. Not a worthless book, but not a particularly good value for your money."
4,"Looks good, fits well","This is the black version of the 30630 chrome plates. The black looks like a glossy paint, not as smooth as the chrome finish. My CA plates fit with a little bit of space around the edges. Plate fits on top of the screw tabs - the frame goes between the plate and the car, and doesn't obstruct any part of the plate. The only function of this frame is to make the car look better, and I think it does a great job at that."
3,Too small,"I ordered these on the recommendation of a friend. The quality craftmanship is obvious, and they look and feel like they are made out of rugged and study materials. However, even though I purchased the XXL size, I can't get them onto my hand comfortably. I'm 6'5 and 350 lbs, so I understand that I'm a lot larger than what most people consider ""xxl"" and don't feel that this is really a defect with the product, as much as it's a defect in sizing. The back of the hand pad rests solidly centered on my knuckles, when it should be centered on the back of my hand, and each of the back of the finger pads rest solidly on my middle knuckles, when I would expect them to rest on the back of the first finger segment."
1,You waste you r time ordering this product,I ordered this product from this site over 2 months ago. I have never received confirmation of the order from the selling company even though when I ordered the amazon ad showed there were (3) pairs available for purchase.I notice today there is still (1) pair of this product advertised as available for purchase.Where is my order ???You waste your time ordering this product.
3,Permit me a break,"The eternal question about wrestling used to be ""is it for real"". Of course it is not, but the performance is nonetheless compelling as the stunts required are very exacting. In this DVD, we see ultimate fighting, but it appears choreographed also. At no time do I think that anyone is fighting in earnest, with a cavalier attitude to injury. All appears measured, blocked out(in movie terms), and staged. As such, it is mildly amusing at best. After seeing legitimate female boxing, with its wild and almost hellbent for leather fights, I thought this DVD would be a fun look back. Instead, we just get to see fights in which noone is put out or knocked out. That would be OK, but the boxing arts are not displayed either..it's all Hollywoood."
2,first time fighters,"This film is totally unprofessional in respect to the quality of the female boxers. If biting the breast is a new rule in boxing then the 12 knockdown rule is too. Having boxed and being a 1st Dan in TKD since 1986 I have seen a plethora of fights as well as a having been a competitor. Any of these women if trained properly could become pro's but that is not the case here. I though that Ultimate Fighting is the worst title for this DVD. How about ultimate embarrassment.If you want to see good female boxing then Lucia Rijker in ""Shadow Boxers is a great pick. Craig Barr."
4,good read,I love fantasy and crime books. This author combines both. I look forward to reading more from her.
4,Love this series but.........,"I really love this series by C.E. Murphy. The first book was a special favorite as I liked all of the characters right from the first page. I looked forward to the second book ""Thunderbird Falls"" with great anticipation. The plot, as described elsewhere, was well developed even if somewhat predictable. The characters, as always, were likeable. Perhaps, the relationship between Joanne and Gary almost feels a bit incestuous and I would like more development between Joanne and Morrison.I really like this author and this series and would recommend it to any and all. And I look forward to future developments and the discovery of what happened to ""Coyote""."
4,Worth reading,About the same class of writting as her first book. I enjoyed it and look forward to the next one.I recommend it.
2,It was ok....,Would you try another book from C.E. Murphy and/or Gabra Zackman?I think I'll pass on both of them.Would you ever listen to anything by C.E. Murphy again?C.E. Murphy wrote a romance book and that is what it is. I wouldn't think C.E. Murphy would want to change anything. It fit the book that C.E. Murphy was trying for.What didn't you like about Gabra Zackman's performance?It was a very flat performance. Very dry.Any additional comments?It was to more romance and not enough Urban Fantasy for me.
2,A Little Obvious,"It's an okay read, but not spectacular. It seemed to rely heavily on Joanne not noticing things that she really probably should have--specially considering that she's a cop and been walking the beat. Surely when Faye pops out of nowhere, Joanne should have been at least suspicious and certainly very cautious before jumping in all the way. When Faye started talking about bringing over a powerful god (or whatever he was) to ""fix"" things, that should have raised all kinds alarm bells. Never once did Joanne even bother to ask her teacher anything about the god other than to go see him. Joanne just seemed to walk through the book without really actually thinking about anything."
3,"love the series, the main character gets annoying in this one","The author writes very well, descriptively, intelligent words and background, with a great flowing pace. One problem is that she makes the characters act pretty simple at times. I wanted to scream several times while reading this book because the main character Joanne off handedly joins a coven that is trying to bring over all supernatural beings into the everyday world. They have no problem that demons and monsters are let out and that they are walking the streets and people are getting into accidents. Even though the main character later berates herself that she was stupid, I don't think it was for the obvious reasons. I gave the book a 3 because I looked past this horrible flaw. If you are ok with ignoring smart characters acting amazing stupid for long periods of time, then this book is really good. I really enjoy the series."
3,"second in series, did not live up to first","I enjoyed the first, but this one did not quite meet expectations. The characters did not develop, and the story was flat and predicatable. Still worth the read though."
3,Too much power way to quickly,Walker gained enough power in the first book to black out Seattle. This book picks up a few months later and she's starting to realize some of the consequences of her previous actions. When the situation spirals out of control instead of thinking the situation out she throws more power into the mix and bullies her way through.An 'OK' Sunday afternoon read.
4,El libro que usamos en AP,"I'm using ""Abriendo paso: gramática"" in my AP Spanish class and I really like it. It doesn't use a lot of color or pictures, but that's OK with me. It lays out the grammar rules (in English with sample sentences and translations) and gives exercises to aid in understanding. We're using this book in conjunction with ""Una vez más"" and I must say they compliment eachother nicely. Abriendo paso describes rules in English and gives translations of example sentences, so it clears up confusion easily. However, there are usually only two or three ""ejercisios"" per rule. This is where ""Una vez más"" comes in. It also has a few exercises for each rule, so it's nice to combine the two. However ""Una vez más"" has no English so it can add to confusion (on the other hand it's good practice!)"
5,Praise In Motion-Great Songs for Little Children,"Praise In Motion is a wonderful collection of 72 songs with motions for young children. It was developed by a Christian Music Teacher with 15 years experience in the classroom. ALL of the songs have been tested and proven. Young children LOVE these songs. There is nothing negative at all in this production. The songs are fun and feature many young children and a loving music teacher. If you would like to sample any of the music, you will find all of the songs on YouTube, or you may also preview all of the songs and download free lyrics at PraiseInMotion.net. You will be able to read the developer's bio and also order the product on DVD and CD, with Menus for Chapter and Song Selection. The newest version of Praise In Motion is only available through the official website."
1,Not for children,I've taught children for many years and my family has many teahers . We were shocked by the content of this video .It would definetely scare young children . Not only would I not recommend it I disposed of my copy .
4,Helpful and Hopeful,"This is a great workbook for people in relationships. It's a workbook that helps couples to work out their differences in a positive way. It is not filled with obvious answers or pat advice, but instead guides a couple through argument ""techniques"" designed to increase communication and decrease strife. I highly reccomend it to all couples."
4,One Weird Beard,"This is a terrific book. It's very funny and sweet at the same time. My 1-year old doesn't get it yet, but likes the vibrant pictures, and it cracks him up to see me in the beard. I predict it will be a favorite of his for some time...."
5,Speaking Japanese just fine,"My daughter loves having this as one of the texts for her second year Japanese class--says that is better than what she was using in first year, and she seems to moving through the lessons rather quickly . . ."
4,Control the Firing Line,"The book emphasizes how to attack your opponent before they set - creating an advantage for yourself. He demonstrates strategies and provides simple, yet effective drills to help you. One thing that was missing is that the description says you will learn how to analyze fighting styles. I was looking forward do that section. However, it isn't in this DVD! I thought I missed it, so I watched the DVD again--it is not covered. On the packaging it says the DVD is 30 minutes. It's actually 81 minutes. Overall, a valuable DVD on a very important aspect of fighting."
4,Great Live Album,"If you like Holly Golightly's music then you will not be disappointed with this album. The reviewers who gave this album low ratings because of quality must have missed that this is a LIVE album. Yes, you can hear people talking in the back ground and glasses clinking but that's half the appeal. You can tell it was recorded at a small intimate venue. It's definitely not a polished studio album but that should be obvious. As far as live albums go the quality is just fine. The small interactions between the band and the crowd are a cute addition to the music which is well played."
1,Great songs - horrendous recording quality,Just a quick note to say that this is by far the worst mastered CD I have come across. As much as I wanted to I could not listen to a single song in full. This is no reflection on Holly's music or performance - just a quality of the recording itself...
5,Time and Money Flash Cards,These flashcards were great! We used them over the summer to help my 1st grader learn to tell time and count money.
2,Weak plastic gears,I wish Irwin would improve this design. I used this reel for about 3 months before the gear broke inside. I was snapping a line when the reel released. I took it apart to find the plastic gear inside had split in two pieces. Also don't have much appreciation for the line as it frays easily. I do like the speed of retracting the line. Maybe they will improve this one.
1,chalk line,"right out of the box 1st use it jambed, this is the 2nd one of this type (Craftsman) and both jamb up. i just bought the good old fashion Stanley yellow cast type...tried and true. don't bother buying this, do it the old fashion way and do a couple more wind ups and save yourself some trouble."
4,a marching band of tone,"Within the circle of New York City minimalist composers, Arnold Dreyblatt is one of maybe two that deal as directly with rhythmic components as with their harmonic counterparts. The precise detail applied to the micro-manipulation of tone (in the direct lineage of Tony Conrad) is extended to the ideas of rhythm; clanging overtones bounce double excited in relation to the changing of rhythmic patterns, acheiving a very ""rockist"" structure. This is minimalism to play LOUD on a car stereo, or to dance to at your city's latest avant-social."
3,Independent film at it's most independent,"OK, I bought this back in 1995....maybe 1996 when I joined the Lisa Cook Fan Club out of Fangoria Magazine. Yep the movie is pretty much the lowest form on independent cinema along with ""Plan 9"". But I take my hat off to Todd and Lisa Cook, they made this and marketed this on their own and some of their friends. Effects are cheesy....cigarrete smoke backwards for instance....but with almost no budget and no frills you shouldn't expect James Cameron material. It's a good movie to rent and see on a lark, maybe watch once with some friends and play Mystery Science Theater with it. (enough plugs?)"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,"I love B movies,but this was horrible.It look like a bunch of kids with a camcorder on a drunken weekend.The story made no sense,I couldn't even get through the whole movie(first time ever for me).The only reason I gave it one star is because I couldn't give it 0."
3,Good survey but misses the mark,"'The Encyclopedia of Modern Armor: The Heavy Tank' documentary provides a survey of modern (1942-present) heavy tanks. But that is also its problem. While it covers heavy tanks starting with the Tiger and Panther through the M60, T-62, Merkava, and onto the M1 (plus many more) very little information is given on any particular vehicle. As a result, only the newcomer to armor will probably find this title of interest. In addition, many tanks you would expect to see such as the Russian JS series are not covered at all. A number of private venture vehicles are briefly mentioned (mostly sold to African countries).The narrator is clear but has a slight echo sort of like he's talking into a can. The WW2 footage was mostly stuff I had not seen before but was of poor quality. Even the modern footage was low resolution and grainy (looking like TV footage from the 80's)."
3,Instructions Missing Important Info,"The dealer is fine, and shipped quickly (I guess Amazon fulfills for them). This is my second purchase from them, and I'll buy from them again. But I have to complain because the supplied instructions don't mention that three machine screws for mounting the sprocket assembly are self-tapping. You can't do this up on a ladder. Put the sprocket assembly in a vise, and carefully screw the machine screws in (from the backside/top) in order to create the threads. Then try them on the correct/bottom side to make sure the threads are complete. Then mount. The dealer should toss an addendum to the instructions in with the bag of parts - would have made my life easier. Other than that, the parts are easy to install, and I was done in about 90 minutes (if you take out the half hour wasted trying to figure out the machine screws!)."
4,as advertised,This product was a drop in replacement for the failed components in my garage door opener.The installation instructions were complete.I was able to install without totally disassembling the opener as others had mentioned.
5,Great,"I have absolutely NO electrical or garage door opener experience, and I was able to use this kit to replace the sprocket assembly. There was one element I was not able figure out how to remove and replace, but it was not a barrier to completing the job."
3,"Ok, but check for threads prior to assembly","In the several years I have lived in my 19 year old house, I still have the origional liftmaster openers. It is a good/loud product that I dont mind hearing when the door opens/closes(security factor). Anyway, why buy a new opener for 200+ when you can repair it for pennies on the dollar. Your gear will go out overtime, but its not hard to fix for an average DIY handyman. Anyway this product I ordered TWICE and both were missing threads in the metal upside down plate in the housing. Luckily Amazon assisted the returns and refund (I think). Anway, just err of caution to check the threads when your receive, you cant use without them. As far as product, it looks good as new, and my doors work fine. Make sure to use the grease, use all of it. Good luck!"
4,Fit like new,"I wasn't even sure if I was ordering the right part because I couldn't find the part number for the broken part and had to order it just by recognizing the picture. Fortunately it was the exact right part, and fit like a charm. Garage door has been running better than it has since I bought the house, and installation was easy."
5,Very Satisfied,Parts were received very quickly. Installation instructions with the kit were very helpful. I also appreciated the helpful installation hints of other customers. Total time for the installation was 2 1/2 hours.
3,Nylon gears,I bought this to replace a worn out gear and bushing on my chamberlain garage door opener. I would be nice if they made the gears out of steel so they don't wear out. I have already replaced the gears 5 fimes since I bought the opener. Its a pain to replace but it beats spending money for a new garage door opener which probably has even more plastic parts.
5,bought this twice,Had both lifters go out at different times and these fixed both of them. Both were shipped quick. Instructions were pretty good.
4,This kit did the job.,"When your springs get weak it puts added strain on the opener. That causes this sprocket bearing to wear quickly. You will notice the chain becomes loose. This is a fairly easy kit to install. It requires basic tools and some patients, also a long handle 5/16"" nut driver would help. It took me just over 1 hour. Don't rush, follow the instructions and you'll be fine. Remember to use the grease that comes with the kit to lube all the moving parts."
5,"Great product, works like a charm!","I read lots of reviews before buying this kit and thanks for the other reviewers who shared installation experience! All I want to say is, read others reviews then do it :)"
4,Garage door opener parts,"The parts were as described. The shipping was a little slow, but free so hard to complain too much. Installation instructions included were great. Very easy to follow. My door is fixed and I'm happy. Best price on the net."
4,Liftmaster replacement gear,"This product is as described and much cheaper at Amazon than elsewhere. I can add little to the many positive reviews. I will say the product works and was easy to install. I did not time myself as I was in no hurry. Instructions were good though not the best they could be. I am a maintenance worker, so I can figure out what needs to be done with a little help if needed from instructions, even if they are not always perfectly clear. If you need this product Amazon is the place to buy it. Also my worm gear was in excellent shape and I did not need to change it. That saved time and made the job much easier."
5,Garage door Gear repair,I looked online (YouTube) and found the part I needed to help me fix my Sears Craftsman Garage Door Opener.Here is the link on how to actually install the new garage door opener motor gear:YouTube Video Title : Chain Drive gear swap (start to finish)Link : [...]Cut and paste the link into your browser. I would suggest watching the video 2 or 3 times so you are comfortable with the procedure of replacing the gear. Most home owners can do this if they are handy and take their time. It saved me alot of money doing it myself !!!!The seller provided the product as described and on time per the shipping agreement.
4,Shipped with everything - punchkit may be needed,"Everything was here but I ran into a situation getting the endcap type item off. Sounds like a punchkit may be needed. I'll be having to take the motor part into a shop to get them to wrap this one up but everyhing was here needed. Oh, I also needed to drill the screw holes for the large gear as the existing screws were a different size."
5,Very Easy,Parts were shipped quickly w/ no issues. All parts were in box & instructions were easy to use & clear. Job took maybe 3-4 hours but was exactly what was needed.
3,Holes in plate were not tapped,"I purchased for a Chamberlain LisftMaster garage door opener that came with my house built around 2005. The top gear that the chain rides on had snapped off the opener.The holes in the round plate were not tapped. There should be 3 screw holes in the plate used to secure it to the garage door open body. The holes were there but no threads cut in them. Luckily I had a tap and die set laying around and was able to cut threads. I was able to get the part installed and everything working correctly. I purchased the item on December 25, 2012 from Sanford and Son Overhead Doors, shipped by Amazon.EDIT: After reading responses to other reviews the holes in the top plate are not supposed to come pre tapped and the screws from the opener are self tapping. The screws didn't really look like they are self tapping to me but that is what other commenters have said."
2,worth it?,Could never get the garage door close right. Spent to much time on it. Still not working. Easy to install.
4,Liftmaster gear and sproket kit,"I paid extra for fast shipment and the item did not get here as fast as I thought it would. In all fairness, it was a couple of weeks before Christmas. The kit was as advertised with good instructions for using it."
4,Easy installation,"This repair kit for the Craftsman garage door opener was easy to install, took about 45 minutes, and solved a common problem with older door openers. I saved the cost of an entire garage door opener."
5,Way to go,"The Liftmaster Gear and Sprocket Assembly Kit was relatively easy to install. It takes a few tools, screwdriver, small sockets and ladder. If you have a hammer and punch, I would have only gotten the gear and driven out the pins (holding the nylon gear onto the shaft) and replaced just the gear saving some more money. Lesson Learned: Lube the gear each year with whith lithium grease to prevent wearing out."
5,Economical & effective fix,"This hardware set does exactly what it promised, & revived my liftmaster model 1155. It jammed one day, and on opening the case i found the white 'snow' from the worn out gears.This kit provided the fix for ~20bux, and with the included instructions it was a breeze to install.One thing i read in other reviews, people complained the new gear assembly mount was not threaded, and they needed to tap it, but its actually not necessary, the bolts from the old piece are self-tapping, and have no issue cutting a new thread into the new assembly mount.Took ~ 2hours total, and it felt like most of the time was spent dealing with the chain, not the parts swap. Have an old pair of work gloves to handle the greasy, oily chain, and it will be a lot easier. Also a can of compressed air really helped to clean all the snow out from the lift mechanism & made the repair cleaner & easier"
5,liftmaster gear and sprocket kit,Worked as stated. Did not use the worm gear since it looked fine to me. Took about 1 and 1/2 hours including adjustments to door afterwards.
5,Craftsman garage door lift repair,"The gear on my garage door lift motor stripped and I was afraid that I would have to purchase a new opener (this I didnot relish since I have two doors and matching openers). After searching the web I found that Amazon's affiliate had just the parts necessary to repair the motor mechanism. I ordered and received these items in good time and made the necessary repairs and to my delight, my door is back in service. I am very satisfied with the service I received and the fact that the price was much lower than other I found on the web. Thanks again. Another point. I am purchasing a kitchen spray handle for my single handled sink faucet with the pull out hose, made by Grohe and the price was $30-$50 less than other sites. less than other"
5,Good replacement,Good replacement for worn out gear. Would be nice if the holes had threads to make it easier to screw to box.
5,Garage door fix,"This kit, with its easy to follow instructions, made fixing my Craftsman garage door opener a snap."
5,Wow that was a lot of work!,"I used this kit to repair a Sears Craftsman garage door opener. The kit and directions were excellent. However, be warned that it is a bit of work. It took me about 2 hours to install the parts and adjust the door settings and all."
4,Chamberlian gear assemble.,My garage door is good as new and I didn't have to pay an installer $200.00 to do what I did for around $20.00.
4,good,I bought this item and installed it about three weeks ago. It is easy to install if you have the right tools. It is working very good so far. I will recommend it to anyone with a broken gear or sproket that don't have money to buy another garage door opener.
5,Quick Replacement Part,Was quick and easy to replace old worn out part. Saved me the cost of buying a new garage door opener and I am talking about a savings well over $150-$200. Product was here in no time.
4,Good quality parts,"Good OEM replacement parts. Didn't want to replace the opener in the middle of winter, and the new gears went in fast and work well. Will likely get several more years out of the opner now"
4,Some modifications needed,I purchased this repair part to fix a Sears 3/4 hp garage door opener. Directions were fairly clear. The only problem that I ran into was I had to grind flat part of the mounting plate of the gear drive so that it would mount properly.
2,No Threads in Upper Plate !!,"After following all the directions and removal of the old parts, installed the shaft w/gear and upper plate. Attempted to screw the three bolts into the plate and could not get them to start. Removed the assembly and realized that there were NO THREADS on the upper plate for the bolts to attach with. Luckily I had the correct tap to create the threads with. There are several holes on this upper plate, verify that at least three of them have the threads prior to disassembling your unit.Other than this error the parts and installation are fairly easy. Saved over $90 by not having the local door company install."
4,Works fine,"It took me about an hour to replace, next time(hopefully not) it should only take 30 minutes. A lot cheaper than paying some one to do it for you and it really isn't that hard."
5,Garage Opener Works Perfectly Now; Semi-Easy Fix; Worth 2 hours,"I bought this kit after my 1995 Sears Craftsman Chain Drive opener quit working. Like many others here, I heard the motor turning, but there was not movement of the chain. After taking the cover off the opener, I saw the ""snow"" inside of the case. It was a two hour operation to replace the components in this kit. I am not especially handy, and was able to do it with just a few tools (screwdrivers, metal file [remove a burr to get the work gear off], pliers, and a flashlight). It was definitely worth the gamble to me, and paid-off. Hopefully, I can get another 10 years out of this now."
5,Very pleased with order,Product was packaged good and arrived very quickly. Was what I needed to repair garage door. Would order from them again.
5,The included instructions were extremely helpful!,"The product worked great in my opener. If you are replacing the main gear, I would suggest paying the extra money and buying the full assembly kit. Prior to purchasing the full assembly, I tried pulling the gear off of the existing assembly so I could just buy the gear, but it was extremely difficult to remove the pins holding it in place. If I was able to get them out, I believe I would have done damage to the assembly."
1,very low budget,"this movie is very low budget and Tyrin Turner doesnt fit this role, this movie has very poor acting, no action , seems like everything takes place on a little stage in an empty theatre. I couldnt stay focused."
1,Take a look in the Mirror Nolan!,"A very sad story, not necessesarily for the content, but for the author's need to have written it.Every page is saturated with outlandish greed and the author's obsession and subsequent failure to gain unreasonable ""satisfaction"" from the elderly beneficiary of her father's estate.This upsetting volume makes the all-too-common stereotype of the ""sleazy unscrupulous lawyer"" shine in comparison to their client.Unfortunately for the reader in true need of assistance, this chronology of the author's self-centered and outlandish abuse of the legal system is an insult to the fair minded and demands an apology to the very pulp it was printed on."
1,Poor Little Rich Girl !!,"I began reading this book with the hopes of learning more about the pitfalls and potential problems associated with a poorly planned estate. Instead, I found it to be an endlessly rambling ""tantrum"" from a spoiled brat who failed to grow up. Mackenzie (the author) has obviously suffered such serious mental and emotional damage from this incident that it has colored her entire view of the world with an obsessive need for vengeance. I can only recommend this volume as a case study in mental illness fueled by unresolved issues, step-parent envy and outrageous selfishness."
1,Wrong size,"The listing was inaccurate, that thermostat was for a big block motor,not for the 289 it was listed for.Pretty disappointed that I had to pay shipping for ""YOUR"" mistake.""This product fits your 1967 Ford MustangEngine: 4.7L V8 Gas OHV Naturally Aspirated CARB 2BBLTrim: BaseFitment Notes: 190f/88c Thermostat"""
3,American proto-metal you gotta hear!!,"If you are reading this,I'm presuming you know that this was essentially a shoot-off of Pentagram,lead by late musician/author (loved his book on H.G.Lewis)Randy Palmer.This is indeed proto-metal,for its time almost as heavy(and definitely as dark!) as Sabbath.Really,their are a lot of raw riffs here for you disciples of the heavy!Why only 3 stars? A lot of this is really,really rough sounding - not enough to pass up,but it should be mentioned just the same.One last comment: this is easily heavier than what Pentagram was doing during this time period(if not ever!)"
5,Great classic doom metal,"This is a must-buy for anyone who's interested in doom metal and its beginnings. The Sabbath influence is evident, and the Bedemon crew puts out some incredibly sinister riffs. Audiophiles might have a problem with the quality, but I don't think it detracts too much from the CD."
2,be forwarned,"I usually dont write about terrible stuff (waste of time)..but I tell you this is one really hard to sit thru CD..I'm familiar with all kinds of demos and tape products being a musician myself, and I'm a big fan of this genre of music, a big Pentagram,Place Of Skulls, Into the Void,Witchfinder General, etc. All things Sabbath of course, but this is pure crap, that no one in their right mind would put out, we know they are all stoner's but how stoned do you have to be to sit thru this stuff ?? 2 stars for song titles and vague ideas, This really sounds like an old rehearsal cassette tape, that sounds really bad on all 15 songs, thats right they gave you 15 songs and not one has any sound quality, and remember this whining is from a fan !!"
1,disappointed,I was so looking forward to my Jovan but was disappointed when I opened the box & had a bottle of Jovan White musk. Not what I wanted.
2,Essentially pointless,"OK, it's been eight years since Billy Joel released any new original pop/rock material, and nobody - except the man himself - knows if he ever will again. SONY Music has given us Greatest Hits 1 + 2 (even the cover is almost identical), and don't forget Greatest Hits 3, not to mention other Joel compilations. Now what's the point in releasing the same package all over again?Other SONY releases in this ""Essential"" series featured at least some new stuff (like alternative live recordings, see SONY's Neil Diamonds Essiantial release), but this is just the same old stuff recycled all over again. If you don't own any Billy Joel CD yet, fine - go for it. Or buy Greatest Hits 1 - 3 which are still widely available. Makes no difference at all."
5,Thank you Amazon & Billy Joel,"a friend introduced me to Billy Joel when i was growing up - that was 1980 or so... this collection of his best is THE CD Set to own! i can never get enough of Billy Joel, the piano man that he was and the hits that rolled through his fingers out of his vocal chords. i'm not really impressed with new artists these days - in this 'technical day in age' - anybody with vocal chords can walk into the studio and the engineers can make them sound great - - - that's not a musician and that's not music. Thank goodness for Amazon that provides all of these 'old school' albums and disc sets.... now i will always have a part of my youth!!"
4,This IS the Essential Collection!,"Some people (customers) have reviewed this collection negatively here at Amazon but it seems as though they may have missed the point of the cd. Yes, it does leave out a few songs that these people mentioned should be included. But this collection is supposed to be for all Billy Joel fans and the compilation includes hits (and some that weren't huge ""critical"" hits) from his career. Everyone will find a song they feel should have been included. I like this collection because it includes many songs that do not appear on any of his greatest hits cd (hence the title ""Essential""!). As for the comments that it includes a lot from the 80's and 90's that's true. He became extremely popluar during this time with a whole new group then. Many of those songs aren't on Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and2 or on 3 so it makes sense they are on here now. I feel it's an excellent representation of his career and whole-heartedly recommend it!"
3,I Go To Extremes,"Billy Joel remains as America's Elton John. This collection consists of thirty-six songs from Billy Joel's exciting career. This collection also contains songs that did not appear on Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Volume 1&2. Songs like Honesty, and Lullabye (Goodnight My Angel) reflect the romantic and understanding side, as well as rock hits like We Didn't Start The Fire, and Movin' Out (Anthony's Song).If you have Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Vol. 1&2, and Volume 3, this collection might not be for you. But any fan of Billy Joel, can't resist the sound of the Piano Man."
2,I have an idea !!!!!!!!!,"Ok, this collection includes some essential songs, doesn't includes on the past collection...but it's still so incomplete...and unfair for the ""greatest...I, II and III. Could be better (maybe) a ""Gratest...vol. IV"" titled ""the essentials"", or ""the love and piano songs"" or ""the unincluded""..or something....If you have the other 3, don't buy this one...invest in all the original CDs.....(I like so much the BJ's music, but his marketing agents don't). I rated 2 stars, only because is Billy Joel......!"
5,Another greatest hits album.,"Billy, as you may know, has given up pop/rock in favor of classical music. This ""essential"" two disc set, while a worthwhile package, is basically out to help promote Billy's first classical disc (released the same day). Most of the tracks here can be found on either of the previous ""Greatest Hits"" packages or on the box set. The primary exceptions being two tracks from the classical disc. This is a great set, don't get me wrong. Billy is great. But the long-time fan really has no need of this package."
2,Essential???,"Only one thing to say about this album....where the heck is ""Scenes From An Italian Restaurant""?? How can it be called the Essential Billy Joel without including Brenda(er) and Eddie?? Get the box set...it's much better and more complete!"
5,the best,"When I was younger,i always heard my dad playing Billy Joel tapes in his bedroom. I had no clue at the time,who Billy Joel was. I wasn't a huge fan of him because his music was not very meaningful to me when I heard it. About 3 months ago, I went to see Billy Joel and Elton John playing together in a concert live at the Nasaw Colliseum. And when Billy Joel started running his fingers all over the piano,playing his music, I was amazingly thrilled! As songs got played,one after another, the more excited and amazed I got. And when the concert ended,I almost cried . I wanted the concert to go on forever!On the drive home,I kept thinking to myself how the expensive tickets were worth it ALL the way. I think the album is great,and I also think that Billy Joel is a musical genius! Clap your hands for Billy JOel!!... Woo Hoo!!!"
3,No need for the true Joel fan,"If you are a true Billy Joel fan like myself and have a large collection of Joel albums, then there is no need for you to go out and buy this CD. This CD adds few tracks that were not added to greatest hits 1, 2, or 3 therefore leaving very little reason to buy this CD if you own those Albums.The addition of 2 of Joels new classical works is irrelevent to the nature of this CD. If this CD is ""Essential"" as the title states then these tracks serve no purpose the rest of the songs we have all heard for years but the classical works are new and do not fit with the old hits we all know and love."
5,Love Billy Joel,I have been a fan of Billy Joel for as long as I can remember. This is a fantastic collection of some of his best.
3,"Unnecessary, Unessential","Not only is this unnecessary - Joel already had three hits compilations, which have also been released together - but it's badly assembled. Granted, it's not an easy job to put together compilations, but this one just makes too many bonehead moves. It leaves off many hits and essential favorites, like ""Scenes From an Italian Restaurant"" (perhaps one of his finest songs), ""Angry Young Man"", ""Pressure"" & others, while also paying FAR too much attention to his 1989 albums 'Storm Front'. Why so many songs from that so-so album when his masterpiece The Stranger gets only a mere glance? The answer is that Storm Front was Joel's favorite album, and he obviously had a say in the selection process. But it wasn't his best and in focusing on that album so much, too many good songs get left off. This isn't the Essential Billy Joel, it's just another attempt to milk his catalogue for another hits record, and it's badly compiled."
3,Bottle of red......bottle of white.........,"I am totally confused to why this ""essential"" collection has been released. Maybe Billy needs the cash? All I know is that ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"" has to be on any best of collection. That is ESSENTIAL!!!!! I already own Greatest hits volumes 1, 2, and 3. To me, really, the only hit missing from those two compilations is ""honesty."" Which, ironically, made the new essential collection. My advice is to get Volumes 1,2, and 3, then pick up ""52nd street"" and your collection will be complete and ESSENTIAL. This way, unless next Christmas they release a box set with every song he ever recorded in it, you will be safe til Greatest Hits Volume 4 is released in 7-8 years."
3,"Pretty Good, But....","I'm 13 and I LOVE rock n roll.All in all, this is an okay album, though it could've done without the atrocity that is ""Captain Jack."" I agree that the song about Brenda and Eddie should be on it. Another one of his best songs is missing. I am talking about the lesser known, (but nontheless excellent) ""Get It Right the First Time"" from ""Stranger.""Still, the album has redeeming qualities. I was pleased to discover some of my favorite tunes such as ""New York State of Mind"", ""Honesty"", ""I Go to Extremes"", and the eternal classic ""Only the Good Die Young."""
3,"This CD does not have the ""Essentials""","How can this CD possibly be the ""Essential"" Billy Joel if it does not have his masterpiece ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"" ????And where is ""Big Shot""??? I'd say stick with Greatest Hits Volumes 1-3, or the Complete Hits Collection Box set."
4,I'm ANGRY!,"This could have been a 5 star perfect CD. But, because of sloppiness and greed... it fails at being perfection!REASONS1) 53 seconds into ""Movin Out"" there is a DIGITAL POP! Hello Columbia!? Don't you have someone proofing these masters!? This ERROR does NOT exist on the 4cd COMPLETE HITS COLLECTION 73-972) UGH. To promote the new CLASSICAL CD... they stick on two classical songs on the end. CRAZY! This is not the ESSENTIAL BILLY JOEL... NO VOCALS!Why!3)If they would have eliminated these two classical pieces... a few of these IMPORTANT MISSSING TRACKS could have been included:a) the night is still youngb) this is the timec) big shotd) the strangere) to make you feel my loveOTHERWISE, it's a great set of LOUD CRISP REMASTERED BEAUTIFULNESS!..."
4,Yay!,"This is truly a great collection of just a HINT of all the great music by Billy Joel. It in no way compares to having the actual albums, however the big ones that we all know and love are on these discs!!! You should own this CD if you are a Billy Joel fan, odds are your favorite song is on this!!! I'm really happy I bought this, loooooooove it! :)"
1,In response to ajm1195 review,"All in all, this is an okay album, though it could've done without the atrocity that is ""Captain Jack.""I was about to blast the view stated above, then I noted the reviewer was only 13. IMO, Joel could have ended his career after this one song and been a success. In many ways, Joel never got any better than the Piano Man disc. Perhaps some day, you'll grow into it."
1,"Touch Me, I'm the Piano Man","Whew, two discs of pure stink-a-rama. Billy Joel I've never been able to stomach. When it comes to sententious pop music I am as hardy as the next guy but this is too much. Elton John is one thing, at least he seemed to have some verve when he started out, but Billy Joel wrote what might just be the worst song ever, ""My Life,"" which is right up there with ""American Pie"" and ""We Built This City on Rock and Roll"" as totally reprehensible examples of popular songwriting and performing. I admit I can tolerate ""Allentown"" as a sort of dinky version of something that Randy Newman or Springsteen might have done better. But I can't countenance the Boss either, this is way too populist for me, and I know my opinion is worth about as much as that nether region opinions are oft compared to. Kids who attend to ""Captain Jack"" will be dissuaded from both taking drugs and listening to music ever again."
1,the antichrist of rock 'n roll,"Could this man possibly be more evil? To play such utterly banal, fluffy schlock as ""Piano Man"" and then claim ""It's Still Rock 'N Roll to Me?"" Makes me wonder if record burning is really such a bad thing."
2,"Some ""essential"", but more ""non-essential""","I agree with many of the reviews I've read here. Sure, there are many ""great"" songs here, but many of his ""greatest"" are missing. I feel like I was once again duped by the ""Repackaging Gods"" into buying yet another ""Essential"" compilation that contains more ""Non-Essential"" so-called hits. Putting ""Waltz No. 1 (Nunley's Carousel)"" and ""Invention In C Minor"" was the ultimate slap in the face. Advice: Grab all your favor CDs and burn your own compilation, and save yourself a major disappointment (not to mention $$$)."
2,Why?,"Just a short observation about this compilation... somehow the record company inexplicably left out one of Joel's best songs, ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"". Who's the knucklehead who made that decision?!?"
4,Nice Collection...,"Ok, I havn't heard this yet, but from looking at the titles this looks like a good collection. Yes, many of Joel's hits are not on here, but I am glad to see several that are not on his greatest hits 1-3 (all of which I have). Is is ""essential?"" I don't know...define essential. Perhaps Joel chose songs that he feld really displayed himself. Songs that he felt he truely expressed himself in. Maybe ""essential"" isn't all his number one hits. I think this looks like another great collection and I plan on getting it at least b/c I'm a Billy Joel fan. If you're a true fan, you'll do the same."
3,Remastering makes this album sound too harsh and bright,"I cringed when I first played the Essential Billy Joel on my KEF Q series speakers -- This album is one of the worst remastering efforts I've heard recently. The sound is way, way too bright (enhanced treble), and it really wears on the ears after a few songs if you're listening to it on good speakers."
4,essential indeed,"""Essential"" is an interesting mix of hits and b-sides. 25% of the 'Essentials' are drawn from 'The Stranger'(77) and 'Innocent Man'(83), two of his most commercially successful albums. The collection here offers a nice chronological arrangement of selections spanning 20 years (12 albums) plus 2 just released classical tracks. For those who are not consummate Billy Joel collectors but enjoy his music, ""Essentials"" would make a nice addition to your library. The recent ""12 Gardens Live"" CD would compliment this CD nicely."
5,Makes ya wanna say hummmmmm....!,Joe Rogan is thought provoking and funny at the same time. I loved this DVD and watch it over and over again. He has some interesting insights on how people think or not!
5,Hilarity Ensues,"Like a lot of people, I never knew Joe did stand up until I saw this on HBO...I had to rewind a lot of it because I missed the next joke from laughing so hard at the previous joke."
3,Funny but,This DVD is a funny show but it was a bit over the top for me. I enjoyed much of the DVD but I do not think I would get any of his other work. Also the DVD seems a bit short.
4,End Time Reference,Alphabetical reference of topics words and subjects. Some of the explanations include the Greek. Some very good charts; especially on the different judgements in Revelation. Good book to add to your reference library or helping to explain some prophecy events to a non-believer.
3,brain rage,this cd will implant evil seeds into ones mind and slowly drive you insane but you wont be able to stop listening to it untill you go on a shooting spree with a gun full of tacos.
2,Orange hand cream,"This stuff works great, but it needs to be shipped better because the top has a tendency to fall off during shipping and the orange stuff goes everywhere."
4,"Good soap, bad packaging (lid fell off during shipping)","Soap cleans well, but the press-on lid came off in shipping, getting soap all over the inside of the box. Should have been packaged better, or the lid taped on."
5,The Power Golfer delivers! I&#65533;ve added 30 yards to my game!,"I have purchased all sorts of training aids in the past 10 years to somehow help my golf game out. I often thought of giving up the game because my lack of balance and flexibility. The Power Golfer program really addresses the need for balance and power in the golf swing. After using the program for the past month, I have noticed a tremendous increase in my driving distance. I am actually hitting the golf ball about 30 yards further over the past few weeks. In general, I have increased my club-speed allowing me to hit all of my clubs further. Thank you The Golf Trainer. You have made me a believer in the improvement of the body for better results on the golf course. I'll be hitting more par 5s in two now! Eagles await!"
1,Don't buy it,The product has very limited content. It's basically the same thing over and over again. They expect you to purchase additional items to execute the exercises. There is a 50% restocking charge so don't buy it with the expectation you can return it
2,Know what you're buying,"The cd is nothing like what I expected. It's very traditional, and much of it sounds like what you'd hear on some 70's Blue Note recordings. I could easily see Carrington's new release getting 4 or 5 stars from fans of the style... The musicians are terrific and she clearly poured her heart and ""spirit"" into this one."
4,It was cool.,Was pissed that I bought this book in the larger form when I could have bought it in the smaller paperback. But I'm an Esdaile fan. So I spent the extra loot. smh. Oh well. You live and you learn. Either way it was a good book. I enjoyed it at least. I'm a fan of writing based in Philadelphia. She doesn't keep all of her writing there though which makes for very nice reading.It reveals a more believable tale of how our lives can be intertwined. Things aren't wondrous and perfect. But you make the best of the situations you're given. And hopefully love will last as you're finding your way through all the troubles.
2,Small & soft sponges,"These 2 little sponges have a good microfiber cloth cover... but the sponge inside breaks down after just 4 weeks of light use at my bathroom sink. Wasn't used for cleaning or anything rough, just washing my face & drying the sink basin."
2,Ridiculous,"I should have known better. This is simply a dishcloth wrapped around a sponge. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing special either."
5,The Man Who Would Be King,This was a very intertaining book. I love reading it. Just good all around product. I have read it several times.
4,Kipling is Cool,"""The Man Who Would be King"" is the first Kipling I have read, and I really enjoyed it! I recommend it to anyone looking for a good read without having to pay bookstore prices."
4,great,really enjoyed but glad I had seen the movie years ago as I found the langusge hard to follow. old english.
3,A quick amusing read,It is a very short story (I read it in a couple of hours) and amusing enough for the price (free).
2,The Short Story that would be better left unread...,"The Man Who Would be King by Rudyard Kipling is a classic short story with a politics/greed/imperialism theme. I just read it based on another review that said to read it if you had seen the movie. I happen to like light, entertaining reads and thoroughly dislike politics. So this short story of two greedy, stupid Englishmen who think that they can just show up somewhere with some guns and become their own self-proclaimed kings was a frustrating waste of time for me. And remembering the ending ahead of time didn't help. (Don't give up on Kipling based on this book - I just LOVE his Captains Courageous, an upbuilding coming-of-age story about a rich kid who was washed overboard and picked up by a fishing schooner and made to work.) This free Kindle edition (check to make sure the ""bought here at Amazon"" button is lit) was very readable, no glaring editing errors and only the usual margin issues."
4,One of his best,"This story is relatively short but worth the time. It has a great plot and, not being a huge Kipling fan myself, I found it to be rather entertaining."
4,Enduring Page Turner,"There is something about the three main characters and the audacious plan that is hatched that will endure. For anyone that has traveled with frequency, you will recognize the two scruffy adventurers as predecessors to the free spirits who currently search the world for their place. Dravot and Carnehan are likable rogues with a plan, rifles, and gall. They intend to roll up wide sections of the Afghani frontier under their rule as benevolent dictators. They are ultimately successful but Dravot strays from the very principles that established them in the wild and they are soon challenged as rulers. Consider it the Peter Principle in the extreme. It is at all times humorous, dark, a travelogue, and a cautionary tale. Kipling exposes us to a new frontier both geographically and humanistically and it is a wild, fast ride."
5,brilliant album,"i originally bought this album for the second track 'the power' after seeing the video on 'kerrang' but upon listening to the rest of the cd i realised 'hey! this album is wicked!'dont be put off by the fact that the band is german. all the tracks are sung in english, and although i still recon 'the power' is the best track, the rest of them are equally good. Being from lovely sunny england, i've only recently discovered h-blockx, as they are a german band, but i wish i had known about them when they started in 1993. i'm hoping this band will become better known so more people can rate their fantastic music. if you enjoy metal, rock, and a bit of rap then you'll love this. i'ts similar to the executioner's style, and it's got some brilliant guitar parts like something you would find on a ratm album. enjoy!!"
5,review,"It has tons of ideas for how to go beyond the same-old same-old in Webdesign, Eaton gives scores of examples and techniques for designinginteractive interface elements, but without the pedantic, how-tolanguage that people like me hate. Before you know it, you've learned more about usability and site design than you would expect. A few too many pages are spent on the basics, from site architecture to how links work; but half the book is relevant to advanced interactive Web design. Not quite as edgy as the stuff he wrote for Webmonkey, it's as humorous as a useful guide can be. A useful tool for a wide range of designers."

3,A complex piece,"As an avid Vangelis listener and part time collector since ""China"" from 1979, I like to think that I have had plenty of go-arounds with Mr. Papathanassiou. He is always doing things his way and more often than not if I don't like one of his works or collaborations immediately, I am almost sure to like it eventually. ""Mythodea"" may be put in this category. Except... I'm not too sure this time what the outcome may be. I've listened to ""Mythodea"" for several months now and I am still finding a lot of the movements and melodies to be meandering. And let's face it, Vangelis is the king of the keyboards. You take that away, and we're heading in to some pretty choppy waters. I suspect the jury is going to be out a long time on this one. Does this mean that this is another one of Van's ""will grow on you"" efforts or has he, this time, really missed his mark? Stay tuned."
5,Out of this world,"The music is a mix of modern and classical and is well worth listening to,especially with the sound at full blast!"
4,Another fine addition to your Vangelis collection.......,"Ok Ok, it is not his best release - we should all be grateful that he still composing.Vangelis is still at the top of the music food chain! Name me another artist that can release so many albums that are a joy to listen to.When other artist always play it safe by releasing the same sounding music, Vangelis releases an album with a different flare, but the familiar synthesizers are still present. From the kettledrums to the vocalist this CD is a great tribute the NASA mission to Mars."
2,massive disappointment,"I'm a huge fan of Vangelis but was very disappointed by Mythodea.It just doesn't sound like the Vangelis I know;Kathleen Battle is my favorite soprano and I enjoy classical music,opera and many soundtracks but to combine them in one giant orchestral piece was a mistake! Vangelis tried the same concept in ""Mask"" but with great success(deeply moving,evocative music!).Mythodea does NOT move me,doesn't stir up any emotions and doesn't touch me the way his other works do.Pity."
5,Hauntingly good,"Wow, great music. Operatic magnificent music.I love their music, great to listen to when your cooking. A friend told me about this album when I heard it at their place, so I ordered."
3,don't bother,"I have a lot of Vangelis's music. This one I got for birthday. The first movement is really good, but the rest of the movements have too many voices in them which drown out his music. Spend your money on another Vangelis CD."
4,Thanks for the introduction to a great new artist Mehdi....,"I trusted your recommendation and bought this album along with Instrumental Imagery by an artist named Mehdi under the ""buy both & save"" feature and boy was I impressed. Vangelis fans will love Mehdi. That's a promise...full samples are at soothingmusic.com...just listen."
3,"Vangelis has done better, but still good.","Vangelis, this time around, uses choir to make an overall enjoyable CD. INTRODUCTION, the first song is like a song from a horror show then blends into the second track - MOVEMENT 1. The songs are entitled as MOVEMENTS 1 thru 10. MOVEMENT 1 will surely go down as THE song from the album. MOVEMENT 1 has a build up feeling as if preparing and going into a galactic battle. A true adrenaline rush. The choir helps make this haunting yet moving score very enjoyable. Vangelis misses in the melodic department on this CD and I felt I wanted to hear more from his great synthesizers as most fans enjoy. Not really labled as a soundtrack but comes across as one. Vangelis fans will enjoy it, but will look forward to his next CD for his great hymns and melodies that he deprived us from this one. Final note: Great choir work with this one, but Heaven and Hell was much more enjoyable."
1,Enough with the screeching already! Yuck!,"This is Vangelis??? No way. This bears little relation to the numerous other albums of his I own. What feels like hour after annoying hour of operatic screeching and wailing. Very repetitive, very irritating. I could not make it through one pass of this racket. There seems to be only a couple of themes that get repeated over and over..."
2,"Heavy, bombastic and quite tiring","Vangelis has been seriously in the global music business since 1968 when the first single of Aphrodite's Child, ""Rain and Tears"" went to #1 in several countries. In the decades that followed, he has explored many (new) musical styles, and has done much more than most of us guess at (he's done a lot, for example, in symphonic rock, disco, ballet and jazz in addition to soundtrack music).After his huge 1995 hit ""Conquest of paradise"" Vangelis seemed to be exhausted musically. The same year, though, he amazed fans by releasing the absolute heavenly miracle ""El Greco"". However, the new album ""Mythodea"", actually his first new full-length album since 1996, comes nowehere near all these diamonds. Mythodea is overblown, over-bombastic, endlessly tiring, and with very little variation. There are one or two gems on this album, but overall only the most serious opera listeners will find it a pleasure to sit the full hour through."
1,Bad,"What a difference in ""Chariots of Fire"", that I heard 100 of times and this one that I stopped listening in the middle of the CD. I do not know what is going on with Vangelis, I have almost all his CD's, but this one is just a waist of money and time.The soundtrack might be OK for the movie, but not for listening in the car or home. It's irritating."
2,Scary as the Hell that is called Mars,"The music on Mythodea was interesting at first. Then in the midst of the ""aria"" type-movement, it began scaring me greatly. In fact it scared me like the Hell - and i do not believe in Hell, because in fact, ""Mars aint t he kind of place to raise your kid, in fact it's cold as Hell: well that's what Elton/Bernie sings. Although, i was kinda kewl with this sort of thing. I was at once startled and chilled to the spine, when my Mother busted down the down and found me lying on the floor wearing headphones, with the amp cranked up ! This album is the worst and at yet leaps the kind of faith, the kind that only Evangelos Pappathannisou, could dream people might enjoy ! Whatever he's on, I would love to have that in pill form. Love, Douglas :)"
2,Mythodea,Absolutely superb album!!! I haven't stopped playing it for the last 3 days and I am quite fussy with what I like. All the tracks for this album are wonderful and just carry you away with emotion. Fantastic peice!!
3,A grand epic production,"Wow....one really doesnt know how to feel after listening to this grand and very powerful production.Dont expect any melodiec little tunes or soft dilicate piano .....expect instead to be fully awoken.I am a huge fan of vangelis especially the way he is always able to weave magical flowing atmospheres around simple tunes.I bought this album and laid down , closed my eyes and expected to be taken on a dreamy experience , instead i was totally unable to relax .All my senses just jumped to alertness.One definiately feels like one should be watching a visual to this soundtrack.Very opera , with a very mystical accient Greek feel.Very Vangelis but very heavy to listen to.It might have been nice to have found a little calmness amoungst it all.I know over time it will become another Vangelis album i will listen to again and again .IM very interested to hear other peoples opinions and how the album made them feel."
1,Vangelis???,"Heavy , bombastic,repetitive and not melodic enough.The full title for this CD is ""Mythodea: Music for the NASA Mission: 2001 Mars Odyssey"", but to me it evokes more military marches than a voyage to Mars.In short, this is not an album for the fans of ""Chariots of Fire"",""Voices"" or ""Conquest of Paradise"" but it is good to keep you awake.For me this is the most disapointing Vangelis album.Although I am also a classical music lover ,and I am a great fan of Vangelis ,I can't give this one more than one star."
1,Leave it on Mars,"This has got to be the first Vangelis album I could not listen to in one or even multiple sittings. I have sat in the woods and have had the birds sing along to Direct and Spiral. Heaven and Hell is the ultimate test for a Stereo system. Ignacio, The City, China, Opera Sauvauge all great. His music is usually refreshing and sometimes unique or bold. This time it just died. I can always use the Mythodea CD as a reflector for my Christmas tree light. I know ill never listen to it again."
4,"One of Vangelis' most powerful albums, but not his best","After many albums, like the choral, and seven seas inspired score to '1492', the not so exciting 'Voices', and Vangelis' better performances, 'Oceanic', that is perfect for dreams of the exotic, and the dramatic hymns to 'El Greco', Vangelis released one of this years best classical music albums, 'Mythodea', that just like his many albums of the 90's, don't have too many radio airplays, and it's well deserved.If you are tired of listening to commercial classical music, then listen to 'Mythodea'.'Mythodea' is not Vangelis' best album, i'm one of the many that might think that 'Chariots Of Fire' is one of his greatest masterpieces."
4,Seems to work well,"We purchased eight of these for our company to use as large informational displays. They seem to work alright, and have all the inputs that we need. In our case it's actually a benefit that they don't come with tuners, that way we're not paying for something we're probably not allowed to use here. Seems to do a good job of up-sampling, but not all resolutions (especially those larger than 1366x768) seem to be able to be displayed.Only reason it's not five stars is that it would be nice if the unit would turn on automatically when it receives VGA input."
1,These are terrible,"I wanted to pull my hair out while trying to get these working. They force you through long tutorials, waste all kinds of time with useless dialogue that I guess is supposed to be entertaining, but not in the least. There's no navigation tools to skip to activities you want to do. My 6 year olds will never use it again - they complained the whole time. Also difficult to figure out and time consuming just getting it installed and working, then wastes even more time once it is ""working."" I expected more from Disney. Don't touch these with a ten foot pole."
1,False advertising!,"This game pack is advertised on the front of the box as having 88 activities on 3 discs: one disc is Pixar 1st Grade, one is Reading Quest with Aladdin, and the third is Search for the Secret Keys. There's 3 discs, but Pixar 1st Grade consists of 2 discs, each labeled #1 and #2, then the Secret Keys. THERE IS NO ALADDIN DISC! I was so mad that this game pack is advertised for 1st and 2nd graders, and my four year old was bored and frustrated with it. The second Pixar disc doesn't even work, it says it's a ""Print Only"" CD-Rom when you try to run it, I have no idea what that means. The Aladdin disc would have been challenging for her, if only it was actually included! Don't advertise something as being 3 discs of distinctly separate games when it's not! I would have gladly taken it back, but it was a gift, so we're stuck with this piece of crap."
1,"Bad content, bad programming","I have a PC with a current version of Windows and all updated drivers, but the program still does not work well with the system. I get error messages all the time, which make it difficult to play the game. In addition, the content is not good. There are different games in the program, but in general it probably takes 5 minutes of waiting and watching videos to get to three math problems or five words to read. It is among the worst educational computer programs I have seen."
2,Just ok,"I have two sons ages 4 and 3 that play with this game. They like the Mickey Mouse game, but don't like the Alladin Reading game. Too much talking and instructions and less play time........"
4,A good way to pass time.,Read it if you have nothing to do.If you like horror genre then this is a decent book. Has good number of twists and turns and keeps you engaged till the end. I did not like the climax though.Could have been done better. The crime investigation part of the story is quite interesting.
2,MARCY'S REVIEWS,I DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS BOOK. NOT ONE OF THE BETTER HORROR BOOKS I HAVE READ.I HAVE READ A LOT OF HORROR BOOKS. NOT RECOMMENDED.
4,Easy to Read,"This isn't the book for you if you want step by step instructions on creating a workable strategy for your organization. However, it is a very quick ready with good thought provoking ideas."
4,1st Laptop,"This is one of the best Laptops going for the price, add up all the features that Hp gives you and go to Dell and try to find a laptop that will match up for the price............. You can't do it. Yes it is a large laptop at 9.6lbs it is not very portable, battery life is on the short side but, Hp has marketed this laptop as a DESKTOP REPLACEMENT , how many desktops weigh 9.6lbs? This computer runs applications and games at great speeds, the 15.4 display is awesome for Dvd's and games, 4 usb ports, a firewire , wireless built in at 802.11g, 6 in 1 digital media reader..............how can you not like this laptop."
1,Oh well.,"This author and dvd is absolute trash. Anyone who believes in Christ and try's to live His teachings is a ""Christian"". I know many members of the Latter Day Saint Church, and they are wonderful good and kind people striving to bring up their families according to Christian values, loving their neighbors, serving in the community and supporting truth and virtue. Good grief, How anyone would have the gall to call them unchristian and not think that they are revealing themselves to be blind bigots as they accuse these charitable people is beyond good sense and reason."
5,You cannot work in my lab unless you've read this!,"This is a _great_ book! I buy a copy of this for every student who starts work for me--which I consider to be a fine investment. Practical, hands-on information is given on a huge variety of skills needed by those working in Physics labs. From glass blowing to vacuum systems, to instruction on attaching BNC connectors, it's all in here."
4,A Sometimes Handy Book,"I would like to cast a somewhat dissenting view of this book. It is certainly a good place to start for information on various projects but comes up short on construction techniques. Perhaps an older source, Procedures in Experimental Physics (Lindsay Pubs), is better. Of course, it was written in 1938, so materials cited might be out of date, but the construction techniques aren't bad. I recently decided to build a good sized water tank (40"" by 6"" by 3"") of acrylic and found nothing about construction tips. I was thinking of building something that probably required casting, and found a paltry two pages on the subject.It would be good to see it updated every 5 years or so. I see the pub date is 1991. Things have changed a bit. It has a very good list of references, but with the advent of the web, it would be good to see some the reference material cite the web."
5,Excellent book for all experimental physicists,"This book is extremely useful for all people working in a physics lab. It covers a lot of subjects at a level that you cannot find elsewhere, intermediate between a deep ""academic"" coverage and a simple handbook."
4,The art really sells this one.,"A lifetime in the making, this was the dream project for George Perez - one of comics' giants. JLA/Avengers is bound to disappoint someone - Kurt Busiek is not my favorite writer and Perez is popular but still a polarizing artist. If the dialogue is often overwrought, it hits the nail on the head when the timelines start to shift and we start to see the different eras intersect like only a fanboy could dream of. Perez is known for giant spreads and this large format hardcover really lets that work shine. Not all of the pencils for the characters work (the She-Hulk's facial features in particular wash out noticeably) but taken as a whole, this is a must-have for die-hard fans of either/both teams. (It would however, be nice if Marvel & DC would put out an AFFORDABLE softcover trade now that they've made their money. It's cheaper to buy up the original miniseries than to get this edition!)"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The Justice League and the Avengers in one of those inter company crossover things that everybody had wanted to see for a long time, it seems. Lots of chasing around the cosmos for very bits and pieces to ultimately stop a big bad guy from doing very bad things. There is also a question of power levels at work, here."
5,Wildkat,"Great guitar, well built for the price. I gave it to my guitar mechanic and he did not believe the price I paid for it. He also said you cannot build the guitar for that price. It is not a guitar that BB King or Santana will probably play, but for an intermediate player of jazz and blues...outstanding buy. The only thing needed out of the box was a little action adjustment."
5,Awesome Wildkat,"Epiphone WildKat Ltd Electric Guitar, Antique Natural ChromePlays like a Les Paul with a cool hollowbody and retro look. Sweet!!!!"
3,not so good,that boy is wrong first of all it is another crappy neonfire and will break in 2 seconds it also probally has a plastic barrel and besides wut kind of airsofter talks like that other reviewer wut a poser. worse it looks like it came from toys r us with that clear plastic.
4,"Nove ""9""","I had this boot for one season and i'd have to say its a decent boot. They are increadiby light and flexible. However they are narrow and little support. The upper is made of synthetic leather, unlike most it is very thin and durable. As you run in them the heat from ur feet causes them to soften up and mold to your feet giving u a good touch,like ur playing in bare feet. The Axeler outsole creats a very flexible cleat. You can roll the cleats in little balls if u like they are that flexible. This allows your foot to flex naturally with the molded studes allowing for great traction. However the flexible takes away from support. Diadora is known to run narrow. I have wide feet and can play fine with them, but the wider your feet the lesssupport is given by the boot. And these cleats are relatively cheap. and has a great quality to price ratio.So i would recommend this shoe for a player relys on speed and and quick cuts."
1,Overrated. Tripe.,"Very bad example of character comedy. The jokes fall short and seem very standard. Its not awful, but don't pick it up or add it to your collection."
4,"If you can't actually go to Africa, the next best thing","I got this for my friend who loves photography. She's a purist and is dismissive of digital photography, but this book has some of the most poignant pictures of African life I've ever seen. The unifying theme is the natural beauty of a world completely different than ours."
5,Africa in its fullest,"Finally there is book that I can share with my children about the African continent. No guns, dying lions, or other calamities. The pictures give a balance of what Life is in the Continent. Every school should have a copy."
4,Parker is masterful at capturing hard-to-look-at emotions,"Summer of Fear may not be the most carefully plotted suspense tale I've ever read, but I was riveted by the unblinking focus he placed on raw, difficult emotions. I've never before experienced a writer who more accurately portrayed the inner life of someone watching a loved one suffer a debilitating illness. When people rank a piece of fiction as ""for adults only,"" we usually mean it contains sex and/or violence. This novel has both, but I would keep it away from children because the strong, ambivalent feelings of a tortured spouse are for grown-ups only. I'm a mystery and suspense fan, and I recognize the plot weaknesses in Summer of Fear, but I would recommend this novel to anyone who appreciates well-drawn characters. But be prepared to look at real life in all its conflicted, ugly, transcendent, messy glory."
3,Lots of elements,"A racist serial killer is on the loose in the Laguna Hills area and it's up to writer Russell Monroe to help smoke him out. Parallel to the investigation is Russell's own terrifying descent into insanity involving his ex- Amber Mae Wilson, whose nearly identical sister was murdered with the killer's m.o.What really happened? Why is his daughter involved? What is the extent of her involvement. Through it all, wife Isabella is dying of brain cancer, a heartbreaking part of the story."
4,Can't Get Enough,"Loved it. Ran out of reading for Xmas so bought all the back copies of this author who I had only stumbled across by accident when I bought one of his titles in a remainder book store. If you're a fan of Harlan Corban, Richard North Paterson and others in this genre then his books are for you. Now I'm now stumped for new reading as I've just finished all his books - couldn't put down ""Where Serpents Lie""."
2,Not for me,"I bought this book because I've enjoyed other Parker books, but not this one. I guess I just don't like mysteries about serial killers -- some psychotic stranger kills a bunch of people for some bizarre reason and has no other relationship with any of the other characters in the book -- this is just not interesting to me. Plus, the murders in serial killer books tend to be more gruesome than most -- ick! The writing was plodding too. We'd get one sentence about something happening and then 3 pages of boring background material. And I did not find one likable character in this book, even the ""hero."" The book was tedious and depressing and after about 100 pages I skipped to the back to find out whodunnit and was glad I hadn't spent any more time on it."
1,poorly crafted storyline and scenario,"if i have started this parker's novel as the first one, i am sure that parker would have been written off and included in my ""never-to-pick-up"" authors' list.this is a terribly written murders and serial killer novel. the plot, the storyline and all in all, simply ridiculous and absolutely unconvincing at all. i am glad that i have read most of the other parker's and then came to this one. i just couldn't finish it, because i felt stupid if i kept reading on."
2,not a speck of credibility in this inane serial killer tale,"I've enjoyed some of T. Jefferson Parker's work, but he's always stretched the limits of credibility in his plotting. This one is more than a bit too much. Stay away unless you're truly desperate for a T. Jefferson Parker/Orange County fix."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS HIS OTHER BOOKS,KIND OF DISTURBING MATERIAL CRIME SCENES TOO GRAPHIC FOR MY TASTES HAD TO SKIP OVER THEM
3,Had To Return It.,"I live about 50 miles from the closest towers and unfortunately while I did pick up some local stations I couldn't pick up any of them with a clear signal. I mounted it on my roof. The only obstructions are hills because I live in the Texas Hill Country so that could have been the reason, but I can't do anything about that. I had to return the item which Amazon made very hassle free. I cannot say this item works or does not work so I am giving it 3 stars."
3,"Great shoe, but the brown/green color is dorky","I got these for running and general sneaker wearing. They are very functional, but I regret buying the brown and green color combo because it it the most dorkiest shoe I've ever owned."
3,Least Favorite of the Entire Montclair Series,"So far, this is my least favorite of the entire Montclair series. I did not like that there were 3 separate storylines spread out over 8 years in less than 250 pages. It was most obvious that Ms. Peart was trying to wrap up this series considering there are 2 more books to go."
3,Great women characters--but what happened to the romance?,"I loved the story of Bryanne and Evalee. However, I thought all of the romantic stories of the three heroines were rather abrupt and bleak. Kitty, who I used to love, I didn't even find likable. It wasn't necessarily her antiwar sentiments that I didn't like but it was her intolerance of anybody that disagreed with her. She just wasn't herself in this book. I actually ended up liking Care more.I loved Bryanne and felt for her especially when it came to her father, Jeff. In this book, you really see how incapable Jeff is about caring for his own family. You see the self-absorbed monster he really is. However, I thought that Bryanne's story was awfully short.Evalee shown the most in this book. I loved how she transformed her life with her shop. She became more than the self-absorbed brat everyone thought she was. I just wish they had given her a better struggle that working for that horrible man!"
1,Doesn't work on high quality paper,"I used this product on 4 bottles, and not once did it cleanly take off the labels. The wine labels I intend to save are from top flight wines, and generally use higher quality, at times thicker paper. Regardless, this stuff didn't work at even cheaper labels. It only sticks to the corners generally, and never pulled seamlessly at all. I rubbed one bottle with the back of a spoon as suggested, and it did nothing to help. The flimsiness of these does require even more of a deft touch since they ship all bent from lack of proper packaging.I'll be sending mine back."
2,Disppointing Label Remover,"I've been looking for a good wine label remover for a while and based on good reviews, I tried 100 of these! What a disappointment - I've tried them on more than 10 different bottles and not a single label has come off as promised. I recommend you find another solution."
5,Calming and relaxing.,"Nature's sounds and semi-classical music put together. The musicians are played by David Goldblatt (piano and keyboards), Tim Heintz (piano and keyboards), Grant Geissman (acoustic guitar) and Charlie Bisharat (violin). the composer is Randy Petersen. The nature is recorded on location at Rocky Mountain National Park, although the cover photo is of the Maroon Bells west of there."
5,Brutally honest and often heartbreaking,"Alumit's first novel ""Letters to Montgomery Clift"" is a coming of age story unlike any other. I was afraid that the Montgomery Clift name in the title would serve as a hook that would be hard to pull off in a believable way. Quite the opposite. The persona of Clift flows through the story and deepens the struggle of this character to make sense of a miriad of issues. Despite the inclusion of so many charged issues - political protest, torture, foster care, abortion, growing up gay, mental illness - none of them is sensationalized or dealt with in a stereotypical manner.The story is told from the point of view of Bong (Bob) from the age of 8 to his late twenties. The story ultimately delivers answers and provides some closure but never falls into predictable story formulas.I highly recommend this book. It is not always an easy read, but it is always honest and beautifully written."
5,Nostalgia,The song 'Big Rock Candy Mountains' is just the way I remember it on my parents Victorola. Songs are done by more current artists but the style has the twang that makes it sound authentic from the big depression times. I liked the movie and am enjoying the CD.
5,It's a Classical Gas....so Roll Over Beethoven...,"There appear to be 3 Bela Flecks. One does new grass, one does fusion & now one does classical on the banjo.The curiosity factor is enough to listen at least once. Bela Fleck pays homage to all the masters& makes the banjo a classical instrument. Fleck surrounds himself w/different instrumental tyros (Bell, Glennie,Thile, Williams & my personal favorite Edgar Meyer). Fleck & Meyer co-produce. If you like the recent Appalachian Journey CD's you'll find a lot to enjoy here.Also check out Edgar Meyer's Uncommon Ritual. If you are looking for bluegrass,then buyer beware. If you are looking for something truly unique & very listenable then this is it."
5,Beautiful!!!,"The music on this CD doesn't exactly have a groove like Bela Fleck's other CD's, but this is not a bad thing. These songs are simply beautiful! I love Bela Fleck and Edgar Meyer, and this CD shows what they are capable of. If you like this CD, check out Uncommon Ritual by Meyer. Perpetual Motion is a technical wonder and while technicality doesn't always mena it's good to listen to, it does by all means on this CD. Very relaxing and incredible."
5,Bela Fleck,"As a music lover, classical music aficianado and lover of creative and eclectic styles, I love hearing the classics in new arrangements by stellar artists. I love Bela's imagination and artistry."
5,Great Devotional for Movie Lovers,"This is a great devotional, especially for those of us who love God and love the movies. Matthew Kinne is able to draw a parallel between Bible verses and the plotlines of popular movies in an interesting and entertaining manner. I am hoping that he will follow up this book with another one on the same topic."
2,Would the real ....,"Is this the guy who played lead git on the first Bloodrock LP's back in the 70's? I think he is - but why one earth does he now play average standard blues / blues rock, with the emphasis on average standard? They can do better in Texas! The songs don't really have a hook, and the solos don't really bite. With 2 million blues rock players out there, this is really not worth the effort. But maybe my vision of what he contributed to one of my fave bads is blurred."
1,of no use,"What I was looking for with this book was illustrations of how to WRITE Urdu- in short, Urdu handwriting. Since there aren't any, doesn't that make this book a waste of money?"
2,Unsatisfied,This is basically a mummy version of the cheap rectangular bags you buy from walmart. I shouldn't have expected anything from such a cheap bag
3,sleeping bag,Great for sleep overs indoors. Not very warm.Outside construction not durable for outdoors and snags easily.Good Value for the price.
4,Good bag for hiking,"This bag was purchased for a Boy Scout 50 mile hike. I had hopes it would roll smaller, but it still fit in sleeping bag compartment of backpack. Weight was a greater issue and it was a very light bag to trudge along with. It was also very comfortable and roomy for a guy 5'11"" who rolls over a lot inside the bag. Temps were above 50 for the week we were out, but even in a warm climate I didn't feel like I was roasting in the bag like some sleeping bags do."
4,Not as warm as we thought it would be.,I bought three of these for my grandsons. They went camping and were cold all night. The temperature was in the 40's that night. To keep as warm as this bag advertises you would need to sleep on a pad and wear thermal underwear.
3,GREAT FUN! ACTION AND ADVENTURE -- WHAT A RIDE!,"From Boston to the Rockie Mountains, and parts in between, this is one rip roaring ride. The author allows us to see the trails west through the eyes of a naive greenhorn who is a cross between the Count of Monte Cristo and Steve Urkel. The good-natured young gentleman, intent on being helpful, seems to leave disaster wherever he passes through. He acquires loyal comrades and deadly enemies with equal ease and departs every locale with hilariously preposterous consequences. The author has peopled his story with a large cast of diverse personalities and backgrounds. The convergence of the various groups of characters reminds me of the movie ""Hallelujah Trail"" (1965) (book by Bill Gulick). For a good belly laugh, this story will deliver. Great fun!"
5,Chalk Circle - 20th Century Boys,80's Canadian band with heavy Brit influence. Great remake of T.Rex's 20th Century Boy. Headbanger's delight with This Mourning and April Fool. Smart and catchy lyrics with solid musicianship. Highly recommended for fans of the 80's and Canadian Rock.Doc1705
3,Beautiful pictues...,...always inspire me to try recipes rather than just let the book sit on the shelf. This book also gives good basic info for the novice who has never made pizza from scratch. There is a diverse range of pizzas to try in this book but some of them are a bit to ornate or experimental for me. Caviar or dessert pizza sound gross to me but I'll make the basic tomato pizza over and over.
1,Orion and the Pyramids,"Purchased item thinking it was going to be a regular DVD. However, it turned out to be a very boring conference.I love Egyptian art and always pleased with mostly everything, however I was very upset that I lost my money and will not watch this DVD again.The DVD should specify that is a conference with little regard for the filming quality of it.Give a -1."
1,"Poor Printer, spend your money on.........","The Lexmark brand printers do not print photos as well as an Epson or an HP. Lexmarks usually do not print text as crisp and clear and they can jam and misallign alot, I had many problems with this even after technical support and re-doing the allignment. I would avoid Canon too, which are known to jam frequently and use a lot of ink (waste ink). HP tend to be the best quality so put the money into one of them, the ink cartridges last longer in an HP printer also."
4,Pleasant diversion,This is a nice casual game but it gets repetitive after awhile. Recommend it for occasional gaming.
3,cute,the movie is very light on plot and predictable but I like the caters so it was OK.. just a lite romance.
3,Wish I had liked it more,"This was a fun, quirky show. I won't ever be watching it again tho. There were just things that bugged. The scene transitions were way off who ever patched this movie together didn't do a great job. The best part about the movie is the two main actors who I love. The side characters got a little annoying and the fight between these two was silly and not believable. It's a good thing I had a free rental or I would be sad I spent my money on this.Sex- Lots of innuendo especially from a nasty guy who had a fling with the girl. Three sex scene one I fast forwarded over because the couple kinda made me sick. The other two just the two of them in bed after talking and kissing.Language-Lots of English swearing and a couple of our words."
2,Never quite found its connections,The script was poor. The story took so many directions that never made sense. The dialogue was boring and had no depth. The main characters had no chemistry. All in all it was a waste of time to watch.
2,Wait for it to come on TV,"I liked Claire Forlani in other films, but this film left me wondering if she can act. The expressions of sweet innocence that made her appealing when she was younger now make her look dense. There was no chemistry between the leads, which is certain death to a romantic comedy. I thought this might be a remake of ""No Reservations"" (a really good romantic comedy). It isn't. The film moved too slowly to enjoy. The dialog was dull and the story was uninspiring. Overall it is a very forgettable film."
4,Love's Kitchen,"This movie had two things going for it, as far as I was concerned, Claire Forlani and Dougray Scott. I had seen them in other movies and was impressed with them. It wasn't until after I had seen this movie, that I learned that they are actually married to each other in real life. I liked how he had put his heart on hold after his wife died, but she forced him to really look at his life and his daughter's life. It just proves that sometimes the most obvious things are the hardest for us to see."
1,time suck,"wow....this film is a total time suck at best!!acting...poor!content...poorer!and i'm one of those easily entertained folks who loves to watch crap just for the fun of it, but this was at a whole new level of crap."
4,"Cute, Entertaining","I just finished watching this movie, and found it cute and entertaining. For those that like to pick a movie apart, you will probably find all kinds of things not to like about it, however I watch movies for entertainment, and generally go for feel good movies. This fit the bill, and was a great way to spend the afternoon. No stellar performances, but I like Claire Forlani, and the balance of the actors were funny and quirky."
4,This is a very good cast,"Of course it is predictable, so many of these romantic comedy's are. It is fun, the main characters staff are fun, there are points I felt were too silly, but overall entertaining."
4,Cute Movie,"This was a cute movie. I think it is really under appreciated flying under the radar. You see the real life chemistry come through on the screen. Cliche maybe but it was worth watching and buying, especially for the British accents. =)"
3,"Not bad, but some ideas missed","As a 10-year web design vetran, I know I look at this book differently from many. I thought it was well written, but missed some key concepts that I encounter regularly. If you have the time to build your own site, which most businesspeople don't, this book would be a valuable addition."
5,The one web design book you need,"This comprehensive guide covers all the basics, from building a customer profile that drives all design decisions to evaluating the usability of a site on real customers. Others have mentioned the real-world examples -- they're worth the price of the book alone. But what sets this guide apart from every other UI design book out there is the discussion of the design (and launch) process, the different roles that are essential to maintaining a site, and the technologies that a web designer needs to know about (technologies that impact design).A valuable guide for newbie designers and experienced pros alike. An excellent reference book that I'll turn to again and again."
3,Good second effort,"I was concerned about the sophomore slump creeping up on them because of the wealth of producers on the first album. Well it didn't happen: ESPINA is as tight and focused, as the previous album was outrageous. The producers are now just Pat Briggs the lead singer and songwriter and Doug DeAngelis the programmer and synth player. They also moved from a major label to a very small independent one. A move that will irreparably damage there visibility and sales, but looks to have let them grow creatively. The sound here is hard to describe; sort of JANE'S ADDICTION meets JUDAS PREIST and remixed by FLOOD and DAVE OGLEVIE. Heavily produced layered music with high pitched heavy metal tinged lyrics and a heavy touch of the ethereal.Stand out tunes includes BLEEDING and SOLDIER OF WAR. The strength of this album makes me hope they catch on, at least a little bit so there will be more tunes."
4,"Blissful, Iceful Extravagance","I am a recent convert to the Philosophy range, it is slightly harder to get hold of in the UK and more expensive but the products as everyone knows works!!! Your skin and spirit feels better instantly. However, this little miracle smells heavenly like a gorgeous childhood peppermint candy cane, the gel is silky smooth and makes you tingle. This is a wonderful way to wake up in the morning. Highly recomended for an indulgent shower or blissful winter bath. Now if they only made candles to go with it!!!! Since using the range I know of three people who have thrown alot of their skincare products out and are simply starting again with this range."
4,Lithium Charger Gift,"This was a gift to my son who loves to fly RC airplanes. I bought it because of the info it provides and the breath of batteries it can charge. My son said it is a great device. He had an earlier model that was lost. I gave it to him about 6 weeks ago, and he has used it a number of time with no complaints."
5,Every 12 year old boy wants one,Bought this for my grandson. He loves it. Get way to get him outside and playing.
2,doesn't sound like it says,this sounds just like the cheaper one. The description say's it's a screamer of something but it doesn't sound any different.
2,ok,"This isn't much about trading or Christianity. More about this guy's somewhat unusual life story. A nice little read but it won't rock your world. What I found interesting was the unresolved issue of what happened to the people who lived before the time of Christ, when Ritchie was raised to believe that salvation only comes through Christ. This is a perplexing question for a Christian who believes this--it certainly says something about the nature of God as such or the belief structure which holds this as a tenet."
5,This book blows the cover on the ethical struggle in the pit,"This book is an incredible expose on the ongoing ethical struggle in the commodities pits. A first-hand look at what the market calls a ""straight-shooter."" Mark Ritchie does an incredible job at detailing his profession and his life, and being completely candid with the reader. A must read for anyone interested in the market, or just a good book. One of my top 20 books, and recommend it to anyone. Thanks again, Mark Andrew Ritchie!"
4,"A ""Must"" read for anyone investing in commodities","This very honest account of floor trading clearly outlines some of the subtle and not-well-known techniques of traders in buying and placing trades. Any investor should be aware of these variables and plan accordingly, as Ritchie warns. He also offers a fascinating view of the human and psychological side of the trading profession. The book is similar in approach to Niederhoffer's ""The Education of a Speculator."""
3,A brief glimpse of the trading floor and on to Afghanistan,"Mark Ritchie presents a fascinating look at an exploding silver market, but it proves to be a mere first chapter appetizer. What follows is his life story, an interesting mixture of his youth in Oregon,an extended stay in Afghanistan and the trial of a marriage with limited funds. His Christian upbringing and the moral challenges of his career offer a thorough self-examination which may not have broad interest. If you are looking for insider information on the commodity floor, it occupies an unfortunate 30% of the book. The three stars are given because he relates his story in very personable and interesting terms, but as a tutor for commodity trading, there are other, better selections."
1,It's not about trading,"There are about 20 pages having anything to do with trading. The rest of the book was about his experiences with his Christian faith. What's funny is that for all his searching, he basically concludes that one has to invent Christianity for themselves, so it's not even a good book FOR a religious Christian to read. His brief account of his experiences getting started trading were good, but, after a day or so of flipping through this book I threw it on the floor where it stays until I got over wasting my money on this."
3,I'm sort of on the fence about this brand,"While I think hyaluronic acid is really great for firming and moisturizing the skin from the inside out, I haven't really noticed a difference in my skin while using this brand like I have when I used the Now double strength hyaluronic acid. When I used the Now H.A. my skin was bright, hydrated and glowing. My male neighbor even complimented me on how pretty he thought my skin looked, but my skin hasn't really responded to this brand, and I've even tried doubling the amount I take, and still there is no glow to my skin. So I think I'm going to go back to the Now brand even though it uses the synthetic H.A."
4,Good supplement for joints,The supplement met and exceeded my expectations for it for a supplement beneficial for my joints. It is good value.
5,Really Works!,Have been using this for arthritis pain in my finger joints. Pain diminished in a matter of days; is gone now.
4,Great for the cost!,"These have been a great pair of dumbbells! We had no trouble getting them and setup was minimal and easy. They are a great, economical answer for home gyms. They were perfect for me because 1) I didn't want to spend the $$$ for the Bowtechs, and 2) I don't need dumbbells that go up to 50+ lbs. These are sufficient and the stand is helpful. Can't beat the cost for what you get. Oh, and I use them approx. 3-4 times a week (with P90X) and my husband uses them occasionally. And I've never had a problem with them ""unlocking"" or a plate dropping out. Hope this helps!"
2,Disappointed,"I read the entire volume out of the vain hope that it would grow more interesting and compelling. Unfortunately, it did not. The art was the best part for me and I didn't even really care for it. It would be hard to choose which I disliked the most: the plot, the characters, or the dialogue. Contrived, forced, and uninspiring all come to mind as words that could be used described all three."
1,Luftansis heist on video,"After seeing Goodfellas you should see this movie, it goes into depth the events leading up to the Luftansia heist. The movie is told by ""Jimmy Burke"". This movie was drawn out and some of the facts in the movie seemed to be out of touch with other books and movies about the heist(Goodfellas, Wiseguy, The Heist). I would say watch it but I would warn you that you will be disappointed. The actually Heist scene was awesome but that scene only lasted 20 minuets. The rest of the movie was to be kind, boring. I am happy that the Luftansia heist was finally put on video to bad it was mad into such a poor movie."
2,DO NOT USE WITH ANY anti-depressant drug or herb.,"I have really bad migraines and though this might work for them because my neuroligist had rec. mag. and b-2 for migraines. I also had read feverfew was good for migraines. I had been taking This for about 3 months and notice I has not been myselt though. Panichk attacks which I don't have and getting really nerves which is not like me. I went to see my neuroligist for my migraines an told him about this supplement and when he saw is had feverfew in it and that I was on Prozac he said I needed to stop it because it was blocking the effects of the prozac as if I was not taking it. he said it has this effect on all SSRI's, MOA'a, and the other one which is the older anti-depressant. So please beware of this because in really will make you feel weird after a month or two on it."
5,these bags really work,These bags really do significantly extend the life of produce. They save me money and trips to the store as well as enable me to keep more fresh fruits and vegetables on hand. It's great to find spinach I bought and forgot a week before still looking and tasting as good as the day I brought it home instead of having turned into smelly mush in the fridge.I'm perplexed by a review stating that they don't work well -- perhaps that person didn't follow the instructions to tightly seal the bags (bag clips are necessary to get the full benefit).
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!,The description states that the bags are made from non-petroleum based materials. This is not true. The bags are a combination of low density polyethylene (a petroleum-based plastic) and clay. I have confirmed this information with the Evert Fresh company directly.The seller needs to correct the description!
4,Size,"I had purchased some of the green bags locally quite a while back but could not find them anyplace so ordered these on line they are great and do the job, but I should have looked at the size they are huge, would have prefered smaller size but they do the job so will just wrap them up a bit"
2,Didn't notice any difference,"I got some of these a while back at a local market. Unfortunately, I found basically no difference in the amount of time the produce stayed fresh. Basically, it was a waste of money, in my opinion."
2,Produce Bags,They do keep produce fresher but not as long as manufacturer stated.Bananas kept fresh for about 5 to 7 days after purchase. I would not purchase them again.
2,not impressed,I wasan't all that impressed with the storage time I received useing the bags for some things such as Babannas. I was a bit dissapointed.
1,Really bad quality,"It was falling apart when we got it out of the box; the screws from one of the pockets were lose on the table and when we tried to attach them we realized that the particle board was crumbling into pieces on that spot. We set it on the floor to screw one of the legs and the other pocket detaches, same issue with the particle board crumbling into pieces. It is like pressed cardboard. The packaging box is stronger than the material used to build the table. While we were playing 2 of the legs broke off. I had thrown away the box because it was a Christmas gift for my kids so I could not return it. We tried to make it usable by adding a pine board on the back of the pool table to make it more durable and we also attached new wood legs to it. Really, really bad quality. Unless you are just looking to get kid size pool sticks and billiard balls, do not recommend buying this product."
3,Easy to store,"I bought this item after considering use of my old pool table in the garage as a tabletop without the legs, but there would not be any room to store it inside. This table is very nice and comes complete with all the extras, but there are drawbacks. The ball basket can overfill and the leg screwpins sometimes get stuck in the table. Many similar models are in the general category {large and small tables} for a lower price."
5,Since I bought it,Since I bought it I am waiting to every moment of timeTo learn this bookI am happy when People are late for meetingsSo I have time to get great deatailed knowledgeIt is very deatailed well explainedEverything became so clear to meThank you Angela HicksI bought it when my dog had a disc irruption screaming from painIt was a weekend and I used information from this book-he is a water element-To help him with the knowledge I already haveIt is one of those books I will learn and read many times
1,"I've never heard of five element ""constitutional"" acupuncture","The Hicks, Hicks and Mole book is nothing but a caricature of the beautiful system of medicine practiced over 50 years by Dr. Worsley. I purchased this book with alot of enthusiasm but was soon disappointed, even horrified by some of what I read. As a practitioner, it offered nothing to increase my knowledge of Classical Five Element Acupuncture, and in fact, would sorely mislead anyone wishing to study and practice this medicine. I would hope that students of acupuncture would go directly to the Master's books for information regarding Classical Five Element Acupuncture: Traditional Acupuncture, Volumes 1 and 2, and Volume 3, The Five Elements and the Officials, by J.R. Worsley. All of his books are available through Amazon, are filled with Dr. Worsley's words and the true spirit of his work, and will enrich your practice and life.Diane McCormick, M.D."
5,Powerful Collection,"The stories I have read about the people working the streets of Oakland in the 1960's and 70's, as well as the Oakland Police Department itself seem to jump off the pages and become very real. Old School is a powerful book that will touch your heart and make you laugh. It made me understand how really special these people are."
5,A True Grit Look At How Policework Was Done,This is a definite recommend to those interested in reading stories about how policework used to be. The book reads as if the author is sitting back in an easy chair with a glass of scotch telling you about the good old days. Definitely enjoyable and a good read that transcends generations.
1,Not kichen friendly,"I own alot of pfaltzgraff sphere and this is the worst. It scratches my cerermic countertops and has chipped so badly I threw half the set out. The lids are VERY Hard to snap down, ending in spills. I would not take these bowls for free!"
5,In76 vs optoma hd72,"I made a lateral move from an Optoma HD72 to the Infocus IN76. These projectors have a very similar spec and street price. I switched because the HD72 required a new bulb every 900 hours. At $400 per bulb (every year) this was too much. HDTV looks great on both units. I have had both set to 120"" screen in a 13'x13' room with some ambient light.The IN76 is noticeably brighter.The IN76 was easier to setup.The IN76 does a better job scaling DVDs up to 720pThe HD72 is slightly quieter fan noiseThe IN76 has been much more reliableThe IN76 has a sexier looking caseAt the time I bought the Optoma hd72 it was cheaper, but it has proven to be far more costly to operate. The IN76 prices have fallen to match the Optoma and I am much happier with it."
4,Rare and hard to find classic cartoon.,"Originally released in the 40s theatrically. These classic cartoons made it to television in the 50/60s and then to Home Video in the late 80s. Hard to say where they'll show next, but for now this was the latest release. On this tape is: ""Mexican baseball"", ""Barnyard Actor"", ""Doomsday"", ""Hook Line and Sinker"" and ""The Home Guard""With Disney cartoons really taking off by this time, there were many, many ""similar"" characters. This is one of them."
2,Size,"The big picture says the size is 6""x 12""but if you read downit says 5.5""x12"" but in reality it is 11.5' x 5.5""Good for fishdinner for one."
3,Not what I hoped for...,"Love the size, shape and rack that these sit in!! All would be perfect, but when you use these, so much drains down the outside of the cruets that it just makes a mess on table or countertop. Not sure what the answer is, but I probably will retire this set shortly and stick to capped bottles."
1,I waited 3 weeks for this!!!!,I waited 3 weeks to get this because of the positive reviews.Slasherpool and horror review even said it was cool.I could hardly finish it to be honest.There was maybe one person who could halfway act and the rest were pretty weak.The killing scenes were weak as well and half the time they just cut away to another scene completely.I have been watching horror movies for years and this one just doesn't do it for me.This is listed as the world's first basher movie.I could bash myself over the head for buying it.
1,Who wrote all these great reviews?!!!,"Were all the people who gave this movie 4&5 stars in the movie? Seriously! I like my horror movies as much as the next guy, but this wasn't even worth watching to the end! I've seen reviews before where people gave 5 star ratings only because they were in the movie itself! Not sure if this is the case but, maybe they're relatives or friends of the movie. I'm not that picky about movies but I don't think this even qualifies as a ""B"" movie. As you can imagine I was very disappointed in this movie that had gotten such high praise. I would strongly recomend only renting this movie at the video store only, for sure!"
1,Like a bad date... a really BAD date.,"Quick Points:The Acting- Worse than Community TheaterThe Actors- Skanky ex-strippers from run-down sleaze clubs somewhere in South Jersey and their boyfriends / ""managers"" (wink wink)The Writing- The only good part was actually real writing... as in the written ending creditsI wanted to love this movie. For some reason the villian / killer looked so awesome in the trailers. But it reminds me of that one date we've all had where we are so intrigued by the person of interest only to realize 10 minutes into it that you would rather fight a rabid pittbull for some small prey then to spend another moment with this individual. The only good thing I gained from watching this film is a general sense of what I would like to do to the makers of this movie should I ever get the urge to personally seek them out for a refund at their studio in New Jersey. Enough said."
1,"A Joke, A Scam","This is the worst acted, written, produced and directed movie I have ever seen. If you don't mind spending a chunk of time making fun of a pathetic attempt at movie-making, you could get a few laughs out of it. Especially from how bad the acting is. Your time is one thing though. Don't waste money buying it or you will be sorry."
1,The best thing about this movie is the mask,"First off i dont know how this TERRIBLE,HORRIBLE movie got 5 stars from anyone.like the title of this reveiw says the best thing about this whole movie is the killers mask looks cool,lots of T&A shots and a very nice lesbo scene.Other then those points of interest this movie is utter garbage.i saw it with 2 other people and we were so bored we had to fast forward through it to see if it ever got interesting....it never did.The kills were boring and not even the slightest bit gory,the acting was horrible and the movie itself looks like it was shot on a camcorder.stay away,[...].If you buy it youll regret it....heck I regret ever seeing it."
1,Just another no-budget stinker,"I've got to side with the reviewers who found this film awful. The plot is derivative of ""Halloween,"" the acting is weak, the technical elements (cinematography, lighting, sound, storytelling, etc.) are amateurish, and the final product is completely lacking in tension or even cheap scares.There are a lot of successful low-budget horror films out there, but this is not at all one of them. It's barely even Mystery Science Theater 3000-level fodder."
2,Too Many Mistakes,"I was considering buying this book for a birthday present but fortunately happened to see a copy in my local library. It reads easily but has several gross historical and geographical errors which make me wonder about the accuracy of the facts in the rest of the book. The most egregious of these errors (page 66 and elsewhere) places the Cumberland gap near Cumberland, Maryland, when in fact it is at the Kentucky / Virginia border some 400 miles to the southwest. Also, I wonder about the cotton mill in Utica, New York in 1811 (p-150). How did the unspun cotton get from the south to a frontier town in upstate New York at that date ? I feel that there is simply no excuse for any non-fiction book on a historical subject to be marred by errors which could and should have been easily detected."
4,The Erie Canal and the Making...but where is the map?,"I found this book to be very interesting and well written. Having spent the past 50 years living within a few miles of the Erie Canal (the modern version), I had a particular interest in the book. The tortuous struggle to get support for the canal was well known to me but I had no idea that a canal following the general route of the Erie Canal had been proposed before the turn of the 17th century. But, there is no map of Upstate New York showing the route of the canal and some of the alternative routes that were considered. This did not matter much to me, as a long-time resident of upstate NY since I knew exactly where the various landmarks mentioned by the author are located but it would be a real problem for a reader who is not a local resident. I recommend that anyone buying this book also buy or otherwise acquire a map of New York State."
5,Wedding of the Waters: The Erie Canan and the Making of a Great Nation,"Wedding of the Waters: The Erie Canal and the Making of a Great NationThis is a very informative book. It not only gives the process of the building of this great canal, but it also states the financial and political obsticals of this time period. It has the history of people with the vision of why the canal was needed (which wasn't just for an inland waterway to transport materials); but,why it would was ablsolutly necessary to prevent the French from developing this western widlerness area, thus making it possible for New York and the whole country to expand westward."
3,Should have been better,"I was very excited to read this book after having read a very positive review. Bernstein does do a good job of laying out the story of the building of the canal -- and the key personalities involved. What he left out was the broader context. The canal was a much bigger issue than just one of NY politics and the occassional missive from Washington. Bernstein didn't dig in enough on what the canal meant for New York's economic rivals (Boston, Philly, New Orleans). Nor did the publishers bother to include a map! Nevertheless, this is a definitely worth reading if you are particularly interested in the period, the region, or the Erie canal. For readers just looking for an interesting work of history, there are a lot of better options."
2,Poor Quality Product,"This book was somewhat enjoyable, until the FIRST time he mentioned that ""Daniel Boone's road"" through the Cumberland Gap was near Cumberland, Md. In fact, Daniel Boone's road through Cumberland Gap is more than 350 miles from Cumberland, with an entire state (West Virginia) between them. Disappointed, I continued reading until, about 50 pages later, he made the same mistake. Where I'm from, you learn about the Cumberland gap and Daniel Boone prior to 6th grade graduation. How the author, let alone editors, missed this is hard to comprehend. Unless of course one assumes that they wanted to rush a shoddy product to market so that they could make some money as quickly as possible. Then I suppose it makes sense, in a twisted way. I agree that it could use much better maps, and spend more time on the actual building of the canal. But that's background noise compared to glaring, easily discoverable and correctable factual errors."
2,"Fascinating topic, tedious telling","300 mile canal, ties the young nation together, opens the tremendous flow of commerce, further pushing New York to the economic forefront, keeps the nation from being divided by the Appalachians, out of the hands of European nations. All this, and much more, make this an important, fascinating topic.But...Buy your own map so you can picture the location of key towns along the route. Make it a topographic map so you can understand the ups and downs of the canal route.Fast forward through all the players who had first claim to the idea. Does that really matter?Buy a book on Tammany Hall to gain the proper perspective on this bastion of neighborhood support, and corruption.Google the references to precedent-setting canals...this book provides concise, but light, explanations.In a nutshell...this telling could have been condensed into about 80 pages."
3,Too much social history,"A fascinating topic, but way too much in the book on the personal peccadillos and insecurities of the characters involved. I would have enjoyed more on the engineering, geographical and physical challenges of the canal."
2,Product should have been better than it is,"The TV is extremely difficult to set up using the menu; there are no standard settings so everything must be adjusted individually. I have never been able to obtain stereo, but mono works OK. There is an annoying green spot in the left center of the screen. I bought it because of the DVD feature and price and got about what I paid for at $220 ."
3,Experience the Titanic Mystery,"The content was excellent, as with most IMAX films. The film really help one to appreciate the intensity of danger being felt when being that far below sea level. However, the picture quality was not as good as expected and the sound quality was disappointing; in monophonic format."
3,"AS REQUIRED HERE""S YOU TITLE","Good quality movie but I thought it was going to be a little better, I only watched it once and can't remember very much of it."
2,too dim on Kindle 3G,"I ordered a sample file first. Good thing, too. The pages are too dim or grey too read. The text balloons can't be enlarged. Not the way you want to read manga, too bad. (In English, by the way.)"
4,bought it for my daughter,I did buy if for her... but we have had to fight as to gets to read it... good story and wonderful art.. what more can a mange reader want...
5,Nurture Yourself!,Take time to listen to Felicia Brown's mesmorizing voice and relax. I found it very helpful to fall asleep when I was under great stress and physical pain.
3,Just okay,"This CD is not one of my faves. Both my husband and I couldn't handle the part where she said ""just breathe!"" over and over and we ended up turning it off. I personally liked the CD, Mindfulness of Breathing: Managing Pain, Illness, and Stress with Guided Mindfulness Meditation better."
3,"Hero, Come Back","I only bought the book for the Stephanie Laurens story, and I was not disappointed. A sweet little story and very much in character with what we already know about them from the previous Cynster stories. I felt that that the other two authors were not writing at all in the Regency genre - they should have stuck the characters in a modern novel. Although they were quite well written, I would never buy them on their own."
1,I can not believe they are charging so much,"The 20 bag box was going for 2, 3 dollars at the most. Yes they discontinued the flavor.I guess it is all about supply and demand."
5,tea-spiced chai,glad i can order this online because it has not been available in store for a while and lipton spiced chai is my favorite. I have tried others and they just do not have the same flavor.
4,I really like this tea,"I have found that this tea has spoiled me for other black teas. I reach for it during the day and am considering getting the caffeine free version. I don't drink a lot of tea so I didn't give it a five star which means ""I love it."" but there is nothing they could improve on with this tea in my opinion."
4,Surprisingly good tea,"At first I wasn't sure how this would compare to my usual tea cabinet staple, Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it measured up. It has a spicy but pleasant aroma, and no harsh peppery taste like a lot of supermarket chais. Instead, there was a strong note of cinnamon with a hint of ginger, so if you like either of those ingredients, you would probably enjoy this. Unfortunately, as others point out, it is no longer available in leading grocery stores, so you will have to buy it here."
1,The Biggest Waste of Money I Ever Spent!,"Sorry folks, but this one was a real dud! The author seemed incoherent at times and seems to be on some kind of vendetta to dispell any notion of MPD/DID. I would rate it ZERO Stars if I could."
4,"Product is fine, but shipping is expensive","I bought a 100-pack version of this product. Product itself is fine without any defects. It arrived on time.The paper that was used for the sleeve feels thin, but that didn't bother me.I had to pay about as much for shipping as for the product itself. I felt that was excessive."
5,Please Help!,"Can someone tell me if this 3 pack is 1lb each? It doesn't seem to say; only the picture shows that each bag is 1lb. Before ordering, I was wondering if someone can confirm this.Thanks!"
4,Guardian of Innocence,"Boynton has crafted a suspenseful mystery, set in a part of the world that few will ever see. Though that is part of its intrigue, even better is the clever layering of plot lines and characterizations that keep you turning the pages. This could serve as the ultimate ""how-to"" model for any budding mystery writer. The book seems surprisingly small for the big payoff you get at the end, both in story and setting."
4,Gorgeous advanced skill level Fantasy suncatcher patterns!,"The patterns are gorgeous if you like fantasy and fairies, but there are very few tips for the beginner or intermediate glass maker on how to make (or simplify) the very advanced designs. Almost all the patterns require a ring saw and much skill to cut the thin and small pieces that are in most of the designs. To me it seems that people who would use such a pattern book are NOT advanced glass designers/makers, else they'd be making their own pattern from a favorite picture or print. Needless to say, the quality and skill level of the pictured pieces is excellent, and I hope that someday I can be that good at glass.The patterns do come with color and glass suggestions to help one match the pictured pieces, which is somewhat helpful, but half the fun of making your own piece is picking out your own color scheme."
3,My Grandmother from Chicago and in her 90's is enjoying this book,"I have not read this book myself but I sent it to my grandmother because she is a follower of St. Jude. She is 92 yeaers old, and prays to him daily. She is enjoying it and says it is a ""stroll down memory lane"" for her since she is from the area and was a child and a young adult during and around the time the book is set."
2,Not a very good book,"This book is a continuation of the previous book, as Ramage is still cruising the Med. Sea. He captures one in a series of signal stations and is able to send false messages that allow him to wreak havoc on French shipping in the area. The incrdible thing about this is that almost no one ever gets killed! Imagine that--a war with no deaths! In this one, Ramage is just too smart and too lucky; the story is just not believable. The episodes are OK, but not outstanding or particularly interesting. The explosions to end everything are incredible as well. The book almost seems geared toward 10-12 year old. But there it's too long and too much detail for that age group. All in all, not a very good book."
4,Insightful anthropology study of Mexican colonia.,"Anthropology should be so insightful. Gutmann, wife Michelle McKenzie anddaughter spent a year in the colonia Santo Domingo from 1992-1993. Thepublisher calls this the ""first detailed ethnography of machismo in Mexico."" Withvignettes and theory in hand, Gutmann carefully reviews the stereotype of""macho"" with the finesse of a classical novelist. Again, the University ofCalifornia Press demonstrates that academic work doesn't need to be boring!"
3,Satisfied,This was an old discarded library book. Fortunately I needed it for the stories so it didn't matter so much that it was stamped all over but I was surprised.
5,Better than Boston Game,"Boston Game, a jazz quartet that plays the local Boston scene first mentioned the Howard Fishman Quartet during one of their sets. A week later I heard the Howard Fishman Quartet CD playing at Cambridge, 1, in Cambridge, MA. I was converted."
3,"I mean, if you like any of these, you'll probably like them all... ?","I like Modest Mouse AND I like bluegrass, yet this just doesn't do it for me. It's just kind of ""okay"" -- and each song has an almost identical sound. I guess if you like any of it, you'll probably like all of it... because it all pretty much sounds the same. As do all the songs from the ""Pickin' On..."" series I've heard so far. It's not that it's bad, it's just nothing spectacular."
2,if your a fan of modest mouse you wont be a fan of this,"Don't get me wrong, this isn't bad music, its just a totally different sound then 90% of the people are used to. Imagine that song from ""o'brother where art thou"" that was really big and then pretend that all the gravel in the guys voice was taken out and that he was singing modest mouse, that is what this is.If your looking for something totally different that you can throw in a mix just to make people wonder what it is then this is a good buy but past that i would say it doesn't have a mass appeal.This would be a great gift for someone you know thats big on modern country music."
3,Better than expected,"In general, I enjoyed this cd. Kansas's arrangements always sounded like they'd translate well to full orchestration, and this proves that they do. However, the band sounds like they are playing in a completely different space than the orchestra (they were recorded in separate locations, but that's no excuse) ! The band sounds like they're playing in a small room while the orchestra has a full concert hall sound. This is something that should have been corrected in the mastering process. Aside from that, the only thing I didn't like was that 'tinker-toy' piano sound they use on ""Song for America"". You'd think that they'd use a real piano to match the acoustic depth of the orchestra. Oh well !"
2,A mistake from the get go...,"Kansas with an orchestra...oh no the Moody Blues disease! Kansas is a mini orchestra- they don't need a orchestra to back them..silly, silly. The new songs are O.K. but I bet they would have more power without the orchestra. A major disappointment. ( I did see Kansas on this tour w/o the orchestra and they were excellent. I think they sold themselves short by buying into the orchestra idea)"
