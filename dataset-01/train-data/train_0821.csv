2,Jay to the Ego,"He's back and he got more to brag about then ever. Ho's, Cars and cash this is what this Cd is all about, like we haven't heard about it before in Rap music... I like ""H.O.V.A"" or ""Jay to the Izzo"" like the constantly sing, but actually this was the song that includes the lyrics me, myself and i most after ""Eminem's"" ""The real slim shady"" are we surprised? ""Girlz Girlz Girlz"" is good, love the lyrics but i doubt he even met half of those girlz, perhaps they were hoes like in the other songs, nah JiggaMan should learn from LL cool J he's the master of passionated songs dedicated to girls, ""I can love you better"" His new one comes to my mind. ""The Ruler's back"" is a catchy song too, but once again it's about his big ego. Then we got a bunch of simular songs with some decent samples but basically about the same thing as before. This is good relax music cause most songs are quite slow, but don't take the lyrics too seriously, Rap is all about cash and fame these days."
1,Gulity!,"Hip Hop is stuck in a rut and Jay Z is part of the problem. There's a reason why the biggest artists sell most of their records to 16 year old white kids from the suburbs who listen to their cd's in daddy's car-it's because it's a cliche. Just like this music. Tired,old and boring. It may not be as obviously lame a cliche as Fat Joe or Ja Rule but sill...When you get to heart of the matter, a ""big"" band like Outkast (one of the few big artists that are really creative and mostly cliche free-yet that Scooby Doo song lowered my opinion greatly) runs circles artisticly around Jay Z while groups like Black Eyed Peas, De La Soul, Atmospere and the Roots just put him to shame.To SHAME. Show me the difference between Jay Z's Girls,Girls,Girls and Motley Crue's. Both are just as empty..."
2,""" eminem murdered on your shi** ""","this album is technically good but i wonder why jay-z uses a sample in 95 % of the songs he make? he never tried to do his own stuff, there is one song here that doesn't use a sample from other song, i mean this is good and really bad,let's talk about the album."" takeover"" you all heard this, while most of it is tue,it's a bad move for jay-z to diss Nas, since jay-z sampled nas's voice on some of the songs he made, so Nas killed jay-z on ""ether""and the album, there some catchy tunes here, "" heart of the city"" has a catchy hook, but again it samples other song chorus, in "" renagade"" eminem kills jay-z, he difinitly outshines jay-z, just like Nas said, "" eminem murdered you on your own shi** ""lol"
2,not impressive,"I feel that I am a true hip-hop fan, unfortunatly I was not impressed with the new release from Jay-Z. I only found about three of the songs listenable while driving around in your car to work or back from the club. When I listen to a c.d. the beat is as important as the lyrics. Hopefully, jay-Z will get it together."
1,amazed at His Popularity?,Jay-Z Aka Lay-Z to me still is riding on most of His Same themes&topics but hey if it ain't broke don't try to fix it huh?no matter who He brings to guest on His Albums He still gets all the attention but nothing has really changed on His Albums.His first Album had Promise but after that He is a Corperate Rapper with little new to offer&He is all that Matters on His Own Label so it makes sense that He has to rush out so much Product so soon because His Material doesn't Hold up like it should.Lyrics are Predictable He just uses a real basic Groove&His Rapping Style can put you to sleep.I don't get the Lay-Z Opps Jay Z Hype??
2,The most overrated CD ever,"This is easy. This is the most overrated Cd that I have ever heard. Truth be told if you listen to the radio you have heard the best song on the CD. It is not the annoying ""IZZO"" It is the one standout ""Girls, Girls, Girls"". Another song that is ok is ""Ain't no love (in the heart of the city)"". How this album got 5 mics in the source is a mystery to me. MaybeJay payed them for the extra 4 mics he was given. He would have to pay me a lot to change my opinion."
5,classic,"The dropping of Blueprint by Jay-Z was the only good thing that happened in America on September 11, 2001. And clearly that was overshadowed by the terrorists. But Jay-Z secured his place as the best rapper alive with this one, in my opinion. Every track is tight. Jay had been slippin with the last few before this one. Blueprint seemingly came out of nowhere, but it put him here to stay."
3,typical Jay-Z,This CD is a typical Jay-Z CD. The only difference is that he's got Eminem on track 12.Late!
4,Jigga is back on track!!!!,"Yes, this album is one of the best albums of 2001.. and the ruler is really back! It's a shame that Jay-Z only did one good album before this... ""Reasonable Doubt""... and the rest (Vol. 2, vol. 3 etc.) sucks big time!! Buy this album and it would heal your wounds =)The best song on the album is ""Heart Of The City (Ain't No Love)"" and the worst/only bad song on this album is ""Jigga That Nigga"""
2,This cd is too over rated,"This cd is too over rated for 1 main reason. Jay-z fronts about what he has done and what he does in the hood. Let me clear the air around hurr, HE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE QB, NAS DOES.The only thing that i did like about the cd were the beats. He has some bangin beats but the lyrics lack the truth. Eminem even disses him on his on song. Bottom line, download it off the net and burn it because you might be disappointed."
5,JAY-Z'S BLUEPRINT,"This is quite possibly the greatest jay-z album of all time. It is almost just as good as Jigga's Reasonable Doubt. Everytime Sean Carter comes out with an album you wonder how he can top the last one. But, everytime he does and this is a perfect example. Jay has radio hits like ""Izzo"" and ""Girls,Girls,Girls"". And he spills his heart out on tracks like ""Never Change"", ""Song Cry"", and ""The Blueprint"". ""Renegades"" features Eminem and it shouts at the haters of the two rappers. This album is sure to be a classic and is arguably Jay-Z's best album."
5,One of his Best,"This is one of Jay Z's best albums. I know a lot of people love Reasonable Doubt, which is a classic, but I think the timing of when The Blueprint came out was ideal for me. I'm glad to own this again. The Blueprint is one of his best, if not his best album. Happy with purchase."
5,Album for the ages,"This album is straight fire from start to finish!! the standouts are takeover,you dont know,girls*3,heart of the city,song cry and renegade the only filler joint is jigga that n***a.. Amazing production from the likes of just blaze and kanye as well!! A must have for every hiphop fan :)"
3,This is far from a good example Jay Z's Potential,"Okay, I am a very open minded consesuer of music. Jay Z's ""The Dynasty"" is night and day from this cd. The lyrics on this album are weak, and there is little diversity between the sound of his songs in this one. I do dig the Door's mix on one of the songs. Overall, I feel he cranked this one out with much less effort and thought invested into this album compared to The Dynasty. You want to see what he can do? Listen to ""The Dynasty""--not this album."
5,The greatest rapper of all time comes back to the spotlight,"No matter what any of u haters think, jay-z will remain the best rapper of all time. hes amazing. the blueprint, his latest album takes the form of his first amazing selling reasonalble doubt album. after that all his cd's at lest went 3x platinum and some scaled up to 11x- 12x. now comes the blueprint. dominating almost every single cd in the year 2001. hey, it is still bangin in mid-to late 2002. soon, jell release blueprint 2 as he revealed on a music channel to live up to the blueprints name. the best songs on the cd are:1. izzo (h.o.v.a)2. never change3. song cry4. takeover5. hola hovitoman jay-z rules the rap game right now no matter what u say. hes the richest rapper, and owns the greatest label, r.o.c. get this cd before it gets too old and ppl lose interest..peece"
5,"""Im feelin it"" just like reasonalble doubt",U gotta to hear it son thats all that i can say.Jay-Z got the game on lock dogg
2,What Happened?!,"I admit, I kind of abandoned Jigga after Reasonable Doubt, but when I first heard some songs on the Blueprint, I was going to pay attention to him again. Then I started hearing of the Jay-Z/QB beef going on. After that, I heard the first version of ""Takeover"" that attacks Mobb Deep. When I listened to the final version, I heard he added a verse about Nas. After that, he almost lost all of my respect, but has only an ounce of it left. If it weren't for ""Takeover"", it would have been at least a 4 star album."
2,Made For MTV Hip Hop,"I've never had a problem with JayZ until the beef with Nas started. Now, I've heard both Stillmatic and Blueprint and I've found that where Stillmatic is strictly Hip Hop, Blueprint is more Hip Pop if you know what I mean. JayZ makes sales, yes. He knows how to make hits, yes. But... I don't know. I've never seen Hip Hop as just that. Don't get me wrong, I bopped my head hard to some of the songs on the album and smiled enigmatically to Girls Girls Girls but the only song on the album that made me rewind selecta was Song Cry. This is really the only song where you feel you're listening to something that has substance. Other than that the rest of the album is forgettable. And yes.. I did forget it."
5,A Classical album from (The Certified King Of Hip Hop),"Jiggaman is the illest out there in the rap game. He has amazing clever rhymes that knock you out of your seat. Hov blow all the haters away with this album, a lot of rappers can't go at his level. He drowns nas and mabb deep down the toilet (ha, ha,Ha,). I love Jigga because he different and has his opwn taste other than the same lod hip hop cd. Jay has defineitel answered back at haters and critics who don't know great music.HE WILL NOT LOSE!!!"
4,the blueprint,"""I gave you prophecy on my first joint, but you all lamed out..didn't really appreciate it 'till the second one came out...so I stretched the game out, etched the name out, put jigga on top, now I drop albums non-stop for ya..."" These lines marked Hova's ascendence into the world of mainstream popularity. ""The Blueprint"" marks a near return to Jay's old form on ""Reasonable Doubt"". Great album? Yes. 5 mic material? Not quite..However, Jay shines in dissing Nas(whose mic skillz had definitely fallen off the Grand Canyon before ""Stillmatic""), and hurls slugs in Mobb Deep's direction(c'mon yo, that was back in elementary school, damaging though). Though I still wouldn't call him the king of rap(rem. the whole east coast-west coast beef...he definitely layed-low then), this album shows that he has the game on lock."
3,Weak,"Although IZZO, Renegade, and a few other tracks are all very good, the album as a whole is weak. It is, as the fast few Jay-Z albums have been, a album with a few good tracks and alot of filler tracks. Jay's first 3 albums, up to Volume 2, were generally solid. They were consistant and solid ablums, and showed that Jay still lived close to his roots. However, Blueprint, is inconsistant and weak, and represents a Jay-Z that has left the streets, but is still trying to rap about them. Leaving the streets is fine - in my opinion - as long as you don't try to pretend that you're still living ghetto. On this record, Jay is pretending."
3,"Amazing album, careless vinyl master.","This review is specific to the vinyl pressing.The album itself is 5 stars, obviously, but the vinyl doesn't sound like it was mastered any different from the CD version. As a result there's a lot of distorted sibilance (""s"" sounds) which become a little annoying as you're listening. Some things sound better on vinyl than others but this sounds to me like not a lot of care was put into mastering the vinyl release. Too bad."
2,Screamingly Subpar effort.,"Got it, listened to it, listened to it again over the weeek or so of owning it.Subpar a track or two that catches the ear, but thankfully you can scan by ""Izzo"" as I do when it comes on the radio or CD.One question for this, ""Why MNM?"" Didn't see a reason for him to be on the record. Good battle rhymes for Nas to swallow but a subpar effort nonetheless."
2,Blueprint,"Not as good as the new jadakiss. I do like the fact that it's not all money and [girls]; however, is there anyone new out there, how about another good cd from his label besides him. Reasonable doubt was still his best work"
2,Jigga needs to take his time from now on....,"It's been less than a year since the Dynasty came out, which came out less than a year after Vol. 3, and now the blueprint has arrived. While Jigga does have the talent to create great hip hop, people are still feeling the Dynasty and there was no need to come out with the Blueprint, especially when it is probably one of his worst albums.Every song here sounds like he has either already released it on another album or was left out of some of his previous work. Every song has some whiney voice on the background with a piano, there is no diversity here (except for biting The Doors ""One in Five"" for ""Takeover."")I think that if he took his time on The Blueprint it could have been something so much more than what is being released today. His next album should definitely be something different than this, and maybe that would occur if he didn't rush through them so much."
1,h to the homo,"This is a disgrace to hip hop. This is just jay z rapping about hoes, cars and his money - can he not think of something original. Takeover is probably the poorest diss song i hav ever heard, Nas is still king!! The only song that makes this cd even half worth getting is Renagade featuring Eminem in which em is class"
4,Blueprint--some of his better work,"Blueprint--no doubt--is some of Jay's better work. The beats are pretty tight for the most part. Out of 13 joints---3 cuts I just can't stand--and the others are pretty much on point and worth listening to. I'm feelin' ""Girls, Girls, Girls""--the beat change-up is bangin', ""Song Cry"" is nice, and ""Blueprint"" is hot. Well worth buying---Jay-Z..........arrogance at its finest."
4,Jay Z still has it,"When I first popped this album in. I listened through all the tracks and I didn't really pay attention to them. They all sounded like adverage tracks to me. Then after a while of listening to it. I have realized that this album is great. I can't say it's a classic but it comes close. The song Izzo (H.O.V.A) is a great party song, but it is not the best song on the album. My favorite songs are Song Cry, Hola Hovito, Renegade, and Heart of the City. There is a few tracks that are not that great, and they bring the album down a bit. But overall this album is one of the best of 2k1. All the good songs have a lot of replay value. He gets pretty deep with it. Go buy it."
4,It's Jay-Z Come On,"He comes through, more of a sensative album, except the song he rips on Nas, funny song. The best song by far is Renagade w/ eminem.......if ya like jay-z, not so much ""Roc La Familia"" then cop it"
1,"Spend your money on ""Stillmatic""","This must be the worst album i've heard last year. Britney Spears used more elements of rap in her songs (Neptunes' beats), than Jay-Z used in his songs. I don't want to say much more about this ... . It's a waste of my time. The only reason i gave this album one star, is the verse from Eminem on ""Renegade"". If you want to listen to a real hip hop album, listen to Nas' ""Stillmatic"" (a classic) or AZ's ""Aziatic""."
3,Takeover,Takeover had to be the most overatted diss ive ever heard. The first thing I did when I heard Nas and Jay-Z had beef I listened to both of their first albums. I decided that Nas would win. It took people at least a week to realize that the takeover wasn't better than ether. People idolize Jay-Z not realizing that he is nothing but what people make him. He has to get guidance from everybody to do anything. First it was Jaz who he left in the streets. Then he was lost so he turned to BIG who helped make his first album good. Now he is alone and nowhere near nice as people think he is. People say he tore up Prodigy on the takeover. Why didn't he go at Cormega. Thun and Kicko was Prodigy's diss at Jay-Z. It was a good diss talking about Jay-Z gangsta fakeness. The song was on Cormega's album who dissed him in the song too. Back to the album. Lyrical exercise is the best song on the album and it is a bonus track.
5,Jigga's MASTERPIECE!,"BOTTOM LINE:Looking back to 1995, this has become my 2nd favorite Jay-Z album. Very close to 'Reasonable Doubt' (but 'RD' has more sentimental value). This is Jigga's perfect balance of street and commercial. holla."
5,Hova's Back,"This is one of my favorite Rap albums. Jay Z is a true talent. He is a definite force in the industry. The production is great, the lyrics, the variation of topic and style... very hot cd."
2,not his best,"this was his last lyrical album that he put out. some of it is lyrical and some of it is commercial like girls,girls,girls. after that, blueprint II and black album became pop music. im sick of the music industry turning pop and destroying hip hop for everyone. and you should see the people on mtv and bet saying that rap is evolving. what? is it evolving into hip pop. sorry....the only song worth listening on this album is Takeover."
4,Jay-Z: The Blueprint,"This is one of Jay-Z's finest and best put together albums front to back. I still don't consider it a classic like many do, but I think the only thing keeping it from being one is the lyrics. If you listen throughout the album it has all sorts of different music. You got the intro (The Ruler's Back) and then you got the diss track. (Takeover) Then after that you got the commercial music (Izzo, Girls Girls Girls, Jigga That Nigga.) Then after that you got some meaningful songs like (Never Change, Heart of the City (Ain't No Love), Song Cry.) Then to finish off the actual album before the bonus tracks he's got the song for all his critics that he did with Eminem (In my opinion Eminem killed Jay on his own track.) And then after that you got some filler bonus tracks to finish the album. Lyrically, this is not Jay's best album, so that's what kept it from getting a 5 but other than that it's a perfect album. I would suggest this album to all true hip hop fans."
4,i'm bound to pack it up,"if i could only block out the number of times i heard these songs all over the radio i would probably like them more. but i still really like them 'cause the production rules and mister z knows how to rap. also there are songs that i don't think ever played on the radio such as ""renegade"" which former coworker luis rosario accurately called ""a classic."""
5,It's a pretty bad tape,"To jerycath@midwest.netHave you tried to find Three Little Beers thru ""Soitenly Stooges"" ? It's a store in northern IL and I think they have a web page"
3,good,"This was a very interesting look at groups in New York that began on the corner. Small book and black and white photos, but interesting reading."
4,chucky is back,"this film was awsome...fun adventurous,scary and violent. i loved it. it was one of my faves out of the whole sequel. the ending was pretty cool as well ;)"
1,Not Appropriate for Children,I was appalled at the fact that this contains horoscopes on it. I can not believe that they would promote such a thing on a kids toy.
3,"decent remix cd single--vinyl 12"" is better","I've only one thing to say about this cd single:yes, the remixes are decent, but the original version is best. I only submitted this review to inform anyone who's looking for the extended album version---it's not on this cd. Only the album version is on the cd single. you must get the extended album version on the 12"" single only. I have the promo of it and in 12 years, I've never found that version on cd. It's about 20 seconds longer than the album version and ends with a long high note and a cold ending instead of a fade. However, that ending is what makes the song a killer record. It was the first version of the song I heard (meaning Dayne's rendition) and I was surprised that it was not on a cd promo or commercial single or the album...hmmm FYI, the ending is on the C&C; mix..""can't get enough of you loooooovee e-yeah yeah"""
5,Better than the Original,"Taylor Dayne on this song is KILLER! This is a 5 track CD single: 4 different mixes of ""Can't Get Enough of Your Love"" and the 5th track is the non-album track ""Let's Spend the Night Together"", which is NOT the Rolling Stones song. This one is written by Taylor Dayne, Narada Michael Walden, and Jeffrey Cohen."
3,John's Children - 'The Complete' (Pilot) 2-CD,"A decent 2-CD release but all buyers NEED to know that this title is simply a repressing of the two John's Children albums 'Smashed Block' and 'Jagged Time Lapse'.One,of course on each disc.Good news is if you look around enough,you just may find 'The Complete' at a super-low price.Unless you're a new fan,this double disc is strictly for die-hards."
5,Most beautiful color!,This lipstick is great! no doubt this color would look good on ANYONE!!! very flattering!
5,GREAT LIPSTICK!,"I absolutely love this lipstick, it goes on so well, the only thing is that it doesn't last that long, but it still works really nice, i love the color. :O)"
4,Beautiful color (Dolce Vita) on fair skin...not as much staying power as expected,"Beautiful color (Dolce Vita) on fair skin...healthy, silky feeling lipstick, but needs many re-applications. The only reason not 5-star is because it did not last as long as it should given the price ($24)."
4,Beautiful color from NARS,"I have fair skin (with a cool undertone) and red hair, and it has always been difficult for me to find a good nude lipcolor. Although the lipstick looks really dark in the packaging, it is actually a shade darker than a true nude- but can be layered to go darker and darker. You could in fact make it as dark as the color it appears to be if you wanted. It's a very versatile shade, and, I think, would look good on just about anyone. Also, NARS makes some of the best lipsticks around. Nourishing and lasts longer than average."
3,lipstick,this is purely personal to me. the color was not exactly as shown in the ad and i didn't care for it.
5,The Kelly Family is Music That Touches the soul.,The Kelly Family is Music that touches the soul. The harmony between them and in their voices is so beautiful it almost moved me to tears. There is such a profound quality to their singing is the best I have ever heard....No home collection is complete with out it.
5,Great cd of the best music stars ever!,"this cd is great!I love the kelly family and their music.I've been to 6 concerts of them,and they all were great"
5,Once again the best!!!,"I am a big Kelly fan from Slovenia and I think that they really gave their best on this album, much more than on the previous one. The songs are done perfectly and they really show us their private thoughts! I love it!!!! All the best, Petra!"
2,"This is should not be called a ""biography""","This book basically covers Alexander's father; the political situation during Alexander's reign; and the group that orchestrated his assassination. This book does not address his birth, growing up/relationships with siblings; tutoring; how he met his wife; his marriage; how he related to his children when they were adults, etc. You never get a sense of what made him ""tick"" or what kind of person he really was because no detail is provided on his personal life. I have read other books by this author and that is why I was surprised that this book is even called a biography. Why was Alexander the Last Great Tsar? -- I still don't know because nothing is mentioned to address this. If you think that this is a real biography, do not buy it. If you are interested in how a small group of people coordinated his assassination - then this is the book for you."
2,Truth in Advertising,"Despite being a fan of Jeff Lynne's work, this video as well as the audio CD are major disappointments. The video work is pretty annoying and at this stage in the ELO saga, Jeff Lynne relied heavily on backing tapes during live performances. In Jeff Lynne's Flashback liner notes, he admits that ""Sweet Talkin Woman"" was stitched together with a mile of editing tape which makes playing it live at the time completely improbable. A large majority of the other cuts on the video also employ backing tapes.If you're an ELO fan and want to relive the spaceship experience, then it's worthwhile to buy. However, if you want to hear ELO live, I would recommend the ""Live at Winterland"" or ""The Night the Light Went on in Long Beach."""
2,Interesting...,"Well, this dvd has completed my elo collection. I have all their albums and both concert dvds. Having listened to their albums over the last 15 or so years, I always imagined ELO would do an amazing concert.Pros- It's good to see some elo footage from the late 70's and the stage spectacle that everyone talks about. I wasn't born until the 80's, so never saw ELO live. However I did see ELO ptII in 1997 and they were amazing, wish they would come back to Australia.Cons- They lip-synched on many of the songs- Sound quality is poor- Video quality is average, the effects are terrible. However, it was probably acceptable back in the 70s.Like another reviewer said, the Zoom dvd is much better. Neither this nor Zoom are that watchable. Jeff isn't a very interesting performer. Unless you're a big fan, don't bother with this dvd, get Zoom instead."
3,From an ELO fan in Argentina,"If you are expecting good sound quality, this is NOT the DVD to buy, the sound from the Live at Wembley is extremely poor. You must be a big ELO fan to enjoy this part of the DVD. On the other hand, this DVD includes the music videos from Discovery with a reasonable sound quality."
3,For the Hardcore ELO Fan,"I saw ELO's ""Out of the Blue"" concert when it came to the Oakland Coliseum Arena many years ago. It was one of the best concert performances I have ever seen. This DVD, however, was a disappointment to this ELO fan. The concert footage is excusable given the era, but the audio is not. I'd hope that in the future when someone brings old concert footage to DVD, they put some work into enhancing the audio, if needed. If you're buying this DVD for the ""Out of the Blue"" concert footage alone, you may be disappointed as I was. If for the additional ""Discovery"" videos (good audio), then you won't be totally disappointed."
3,No Better Than VHS,"If you want good picture and sound, skip this one. After watching this one for ten minutes I got a brain ache. The ""Zoom Tour"" DVD is much better than this one. It's in wide screen, and 5.1 sound. A real treat for the senses indeed."
2,A tough way to remember ELO,"ELO had great live shows! This DVD has some great stuff on it, but the quality does not live up to the potential. It really does not do ELO proud. I really wanted to love this CD."
4,Good source of inspiration,"As well as a good place to see different styles displyed together but it would have been nice to include some art-in-progress info on the various artists so the reader could see the different techniques in action. Overall, though, the quality of the artwork is amazing and a wonderful book to look through when you are looking for inspiration."
1,Do not waste your time and money on this printer,"I have had this printer for three years or so; it has been all trouble. The worst is it often fails to pull the paper from the tray, and gives the error message ""Paper jam in tray 1"", although there is no paper jam. I tried different weight papers, but no help. Occasionally, it will pull a page and print. When it gives the paper jam error message, you have to go through a lengthy warmup-calibration, etc. schedule, and then it tries to pull paper and fails again. The bottom line: it is not worth your time, money and frustration."
4,Works as advertised,"It is plastic, but a very solid door, comes with a sliding pane to ""lock"" the door if needed (I did not, so cannot report on its utility).Instructions were very clear, and it comes with multiple lengths of screws to accommodate several installation widths - nice.I should mention that I got size small, and this works fine for my very hefty 25 pound kitty.I used this to create a custom ""disguised litter box"" out of a former enclosed couch side table. It works very well & now I don't have nearly as much litter all over my small apartment!"
1,Overcomplicated piece of doo doo,"Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeell, my journey began trying to find a cat door that was ""TRULY"" transparent. In fact, I passed up all the ones at the stores because none of them were truly ""transparent"" or ""Clear / See-through"", as I like to say. Bought this one because the package depicted ""clear"". ""Transparent"" or clear to me is like looking through a window. Turns out NONE of cat doors by any manufacturer is clear. They are ALL ""fogged"" or ""opaque"". Adapting this door to a well constructed, outdoor cat house, I thought the cat would enjoy being able to see through the door to be aware of whats going on around it while also observing me. Not only was I disappointed that the door wasn't clear, the door is designed in a way that doesn't make any sense to a cat. It's a funky 2 flap, one door design. I threw this door in the trash. Get a PetSafe Cat flat - It's well constructed/designed - I like it and the cat likes it."
4,Staywell 760US,"I just ordered my fourth Staywell door. I've been using this model for more than twenty years. The original model had a flexible rubberized plastic door which you couldn't see through, but it was much more durable. The see through rigid flap is nice, but I need to buy a new one every three years because of my 85 pound pit/boxer mix and his inability to come into the house at less than full speed. But I can't blame the product and the dog is not going to change, so I just buy a new one when the warranty expires. I've always been impressed with Staywell's warranty and they've always replaced anything that broke under the initial warranty period."
3,My dog is terrified of this door....,"We've had this dog door for a few weeks. My dog is too scared to go through it.I have tried treats - both setting them on the inside or outside of the dog door.Tried holding the dog door open while offering his favorite foods on the other side, and talking gently.Tried throwing his toys through the door while holding it open,Tried masking taping it open for a few days. - This let in every fly and mosquito in the neighborhood.I'm sure this door is great, but my dog is a big scaredy cat."
2,A tight fit for a medium size dog,"Unfortunately, you can't believe the picture on the staywell box. Border Collies and English Springer Spaniels do not easily fit through the door flap ...unless they are on the very small & skinny side. Picture a contortionist going through a small opening because that's exactly how a 35lb dog will look going through the door flap - they fit but only just and with some work to get through. If the dog weighs any more than that, good luck making them squeeze through the narrow opening.The flap is made out of plastic and has a cheap plastic ""rod"" system that supposedly holds the door flap in place. Two days later and the plastic is broken. Definitely not worth your money. We tried the larger, too, and had the same issue ...big enough for our dog, but broke within a short-time after installation."
4,good beginners' reference,Quite a good reference guide for beginners. Plenty of examples and step by step guide. Projects are excellent ways for anyone to put their skills to practice. Get your money's worth.
4,All Around Good Stuff,It is easy to assemble. It is a lot of fun. Most of my cars work on it and I have 70 Hot Wheels cars. I got this for a 6th birthday present. I wanted to write a review because I wanted to be the first person to write a review of this toy. My name is Andy and my mom helped me write this.
3,Hot Wheels old fashioned fun,"The V-Drop track works great for small and big kids. My son, who is short for his age of 5, can easily load up a car and send it plummeting to its ultimate demise. I catch myself loading a car into the elevator and using the pull string to raise it to the top when I can easily reach the top on my own. It is a lot of fun even given the fact that most of the time the car goes crashing into something and partially ruining the wall/floor/chair/car/dog/sister. It is a little cheaply built and should be taken apart and not left hanging on the door. The weight of the track pulls down on the plastic snap together parts of the elevator and slowly makes it harder and harder to eject the car from the elevator. 5 Stars for fun, 2 Stars for cheaply built..."
5,Totally LOVE this for all kids,"My son (5 yrs) recieved this for Christmas. The neighborhood girls love to play it with him. We also have sleepovers of 4 extra boys ranging from the age of 3 yrs to 7 years and they ALL loved it.We put a heavy book on each side of the end of the track, like the directions say, and it works great. We also put a pillow in front/behind the door to keep it from moving. These kids have gone so far as to make a cardboard target and place it so they can 'get points' each time it comes Zooooming down and hits it. We get big screams when the cardboard'ring of fire' is used and the car goes thru without hitting it(this comes with the set).This elevator is a great invention.The only thing I would change is the grey piece under the track that holds the end of the track up. It often comes loose and the car will jump off the end straight instead of jumping up. I guess we will tape it until we get more track to add to this baby. Great FUN!"
4,Just like the old Hot Wheels track,"Remember when Hot Wheels didn't require batteries? The gravity powered tracks are still the best!My kids got this for Christmas and love it! The track attaches to the top of a door, and a kid-powered elevator lifts and launches the cars down the track."
2,Very boring very quickly,"I have a six-year-old and a nine-year-old; my youngest got this as a gift. It is easy to assemble and worked fine, but like most Hot Wheels toys, although the box and the ads look like it is an amazing, fun experience, once you drop a few cars down the track you it starts to dawn on you....is that it? They played with it for about five minutes and then moved on to other things."
1,Hot Wheels V-Drop,"Do NOT buy this product at any price. It is poorly designed with flimsy track and connectors. Not enough track is provided in the box.If you want to create the same effect, simply push your favorite Hot Wheel car off of a 7 foot shelf."
2,Psuedo-Mysterious,"Hmmm... not sure if I can find the words to describe this one. Trite? Pretenious? Boooooorrrrring? While Kate Fansler is both amatuer sleuth and professor of English, there is absolutely no reason for her to go around spouting off obscure Joycean witticisms to any and everybody (and I actually like Joyce)! For the non-English studies person some parts of the text will make absolutely no sense, and for the English studies person those parts will just seem senseless. I was literally more than 1/3 finished with the book before I realized that the crime had not yet take place because Cross had spent most of that time making sure that the reader was well aware of her knowledge on Joyce...."
4,Erudite funny mystery,"Several academics in a country house containing rare James Joyce manuscripts. The murder plot is secondary to a lot of talk about academic and literary life some of which is clever and informative. The dialog is elaborate and full of phrases such as ""If you had decided to embrace the rural life you might in decency have let me know"" interpolated with Oscar Wilde type paradoxes, which are sometimes mildly amusing. Many cliches - people are in ""hot pursuit"" ""immured in the library"" ""deep in conversation"" and fall into ""fitful sleep"" If you like this you will like Sarah Caudwell, but the reverse does not hold. It's just not as good as Caudwell."
5,A tribute to the ongoing legacy of Walter Martin,"Many Christians can remember listing to the national radio program of the late Walter Martin, the original ""Bible Answer Man."" Or perhaps they recall attending one of his presentations in churches throughout the country. Whatever the venue, hearing Dr. Martin speak on the subject of cults, the defense of the Christian faith, and Christian spirituality, was an inspiring treat. Those who benefitted from his ministry will appreciate this latest book by Dr. Martin, published posthumously by his oldest daugher, Jill Martin Rische. In Through the Windows of Heaven, the reader will be treated to many spiritual gems drawn from the many public lectures of Dr. Martin. This book has great broad appeal to the Christian public, not only to those with an apologetic interest, but also to those interested in gaining practical spiritual insights applicable in their daily walk with Christ. I highly recommend this book."
3,Thru The Windows of Heaven,This is a book which can be very moving. It provides bible references to each of the authors fathers writings. If studied after reading a chapter a better understanding of the bible can be obtained. The only thing I didn't like was obvious dislikes of the Morman religion. I believe only God has the right to accept or reject a religion. The book is an excellent learning guide for those who desire to learn as much as possible about the holy bible.
5,A great all season northwest blues CD,"I highly reccomend this CD for anyone looking for a taste of ""northwest"" blues. A companion to the ""Seattle's"" Best Blues, Portland's Best Blues will probably get plenty of use. I frequently have friends try to borrow my copy. I'm looking for volume 2 now."
5,"Sunbeam Slumber Rest Luxury Full Warming Blanket, Ecru/ Natural",Great product with wonderful features. Love the pre-heat and shut-off. Very cosy--plus machine washable.
5,Music for the pagan heart,"If you liked ""The Winds that Sang at Midgard's Fate"" you will definitely like ""Volven"". Andrea Nebel Haugen is a true pagan at heart, and doesn't mind expressing what she feels. I would classify ""Volven"" as Pagan Folk Ambient music and is definitely origonal. There are more folk intruments in the album, however, it is more ambient than ""Midagard's Fate.""If you like her music you will definitely like her book ""The Ancient Fires of Midgard."" In her book she discusses, Norse Myths and Ledgends, celebrating seasons and personal events, herbs, gods/goddesses, Seidr (Norse Shamanism), the self, spirit animals, natural childbirth, and even cloths worn by the Germanic Pagans. She also doesn't hesitate to express her feelings toward Christianity and other dogmatic religions(Islam, Judism).Andrea Nebel Haugen has been a great inpriration for me. Through her writings and her music she has helped spark the fire in my pagan heart."
5,Insights into the patterns which indicate success,"Patricia Telesco's Money Magick tells how to use spells to make money. From the history of methods ancestors used to attract riches to astrology and feng shui modern practices, this provides a variety of insights into the patterns which indicate success."
3,Some assembly required!!!,"I have a daily driver that I set a custom sub setup in my trunk. In a nutshell, false floor so the subs are exposed. I needed something to cover them without losing functionality (or blowing them so a plexiglass cover wasn't an option). I saw these bars and figured, awesome. Slap'em on. Bolt'em down. Keep moving. Not so much. NOTHING comes assembled. I mean, not a huge deal or anything, but an unanticipated annoyance if nothing else. Niether my groceries nor my snow brush have broken them yet, so I guess that's a good thing. The end."
3,Speeaker Grill,"This is a good way to protect speaker from damage of lager items but if it had a few more bars it would be a great look and great protection, but for the money it's a solid investment and still looks great!"
4,The authors know their stuff,"This is an excellent and thoroughly-researched resource for anyone considering entering into a temporary legal relationship, either as a contracting attorney or hiring attorney. It's well-organized and thoughtfully written, and one of the chapters even includes sample letters of engagements and retention agreements, a handy starting point for newcomers to the world contract lawyering."
1,Don't trust the 5 stars,"This is a posting from the new addition, which applies here too:BE WARNED! Of the 15 people who give the book 5 stars half are anonymous, and the other half have only written reviews of this book, they have never written a review for any other book. These reviewers have sought out every copy of this book to write 5 star reviews. Reviewer ""Law Practice Management Magazine"" wrote 5 glowing reviews of this book.I would bet money that the author or someone close to the author wrote all of these glowing reviews, especially since there are so many reviews from legitimate people which state this book is pure trash. I have seen it before, and reported it to Amazon in the past.I also contacted Law Practice Management Magazine letting them know that one of the reviewers here is using their magazine's name."
4,Useful but dated - get the newer edition,"Overall, a useful guide. However, it suffers the failing of books that are locked into a specific timeframe. Law firm practice has continued to evolve greatly, and some of the advice and examples are very dated. Get the newer edition (2003), and you will be better served."
1,BROKEN!!,I bought this tape recorder and it didn't work. I tried everything! I was very disappointed.
2,"Jwin cassette recorder dropped once, doesn't work","Although it's pretty easy to use, this cassette recorder isn't very sturdy. I bought it for my wife to use while writing songs on her guitar. Sometimes she wants to listen to a song to remember how she played it the first time. She dropped it off a kitchen table onto the linoleum and it stopped working. For the price, it's not a bad recorder, but plan on being very careful with it."
2,Adequate - but not great,"This is an okay recorder for occasional use. But the sound reproduction isn't all that clear so if you need it for extended recording or listening, spend a few more dollars and go for a Pansonic or Sony. THis also doesn't have a counter so it's hard to find specific areas of the recording, and you have to stop it each time you rewind or go forward. On the plus side it does have a seperate mic jack so you can use your own mic when recording a lecture or meeting. The price is right, but the quality just isn't there."
1,Garbage,"The retailer got me exactly what I paid for, in a timely fashion. No problem there. As soon as I got it I popped in some good batteries and a good tape. Plugged in the earphones and pressed ""Play"". Wow - what a bunch of wow. Do you remember what wow is in a tape player - this things got it bad. They advertise 2 speed operation. Actually it includes ALL speed and it constantly hunts through them. I tried another tape and it was the same. So I took my good bateries out and threw the thing in the trash. At the price of this thing there was no point in complaining to anyone. Cost more than it's worth to mail things back and forth. You get what you pay for."
3,"Good, could've been better","Well, I was expecting something more - well, alternative, to be honest. Not a rehash of unused RATM riffs and Soundgarden lyrics. A lot of hair metal throwbacks...like a space-age Dio or Poison or whatever...I don't listen to those bands so I wouldn't be able to be accurate. Some songs start off with a bang the first time you hear them (like the oh-so-overplayed Cochise, and Show me how to Live, Like a Stone to name a few) but don't retain what other good records do...sustain that bang. Old Soundgarden records could do that. RATM did it uptil the second album. Nirvana damn near perfected the ""second listen's gonna REALLY get ya"". Audioslave, unfortunately, do not. Which is a disappointment. Doesn't matter though. Get Audioslave. There's some good music to be found here."
5,Just what we needed,"At first thought, no one could ever imagine how it would be like to add the voice of Chris Cornell, to the ever groove of Rage Against The Machine. Well, now we know. It is an awesome experience to listen to this two powerful forces collaborate, combine their musical talents together and achieve what they have achieved. They do not belong in any genre of today's music, for they belong in their own world of great music. Cornell's voice is at his best with his perfect melodic interpertration while Morello's riffs are certainly one of the most creative he has ever written. One just cannot stop to appreciate such beautiful music that they have created. The perfect group, and the perfect CD to show that nu metal is really getting tiresome. You won't regret buying, it'll stay in your player till another one of thier album comes out."
3,Kind of a let down....,Having been a very big Soundgarden/Rage fan this uniting of the two turns out to be somewhat of a let down. After weeks of hearing Cochise the remaining tunes don't seem to have the Umph! of the opening track. There's familiar sounds of both now defunct bands but nothing that reaches out and grabs you. Don't get me wrong after a few listens maybe it will come out and grab me but for now it seems it'll be in my has beens bin before the grammys come out in Feb. 03.
1,Unbroken Tedium,"Drone and slur your words, and it must be art, right? Wrong. It's just boring.Two years from now, reviewers will be looking back at this turkey and saying that it was one of the weaker Audioslave disks. Or maybe they'll be saying that it spelled the end of the group."
3,Audioslave,"Ok, first of all, Chris Cornell is better than de la Rocha so shutup, but RATM guitarist (Morello) is better then Soundgardens watever his name was. SO, with this combined effort u expect to be blown away right? Wrong, Audioslave didnt live up to its expectations as most super goups dont and Temple of the Dog doesnt count. But all in all hlaf the album was aiight so download the songs u like and call it a day."
3,Who cares about the message?,"This is a cd for an average listner! This is not Rage Against The Machine! No politics! The cd was made by a band who just wanted to make a cd! I like the cd... Its not boring like the old Sound Garden stuff.... God I fell asleep to that trash... I like the sound of Audioslave its not original.. but who is now days? I thought the cd was nice... its better then Nickleback! The vocal skills of Chris Cornell is awesome! If you want a cd with average songs and not big song concepts... BUY THIS CD! Thanks for reading, peace out!"
2,A bit of a lazy effort,"I was hoping that the talented musicians of RATM were being held back by the demands of Zach- they never were allowed to stretch out and live on the edge. Wverything was very planned and safe. Now I know that I was wrong. Never once on this album do I feel that the band is toeing the line or pushing its limits. I thought especially with the creative input on Cornell, that th band would expand its vocabulary. But it sounds like COrnell doing karaoke over throw away RATM tracks. As good as Morello can be, he NEVER stretches out and really lives on danger's edge. He is the most one of the most conservative guitar players out right now. He can make a few strange noises, but any player in their closet can do this and would get bored quickly. And the drummer NEVER throws anything in to catch your attention. Very safe. I know they can all do better than this. I just never felt that they were trying to push the envelope at all. Boring!"
5,About time,"This is a fine cd; unfortunately, it's not getting the credit it deserves simply because it is a huge departure from the previous work of the parties involved: Rage Against The Machine and Chris Cornell. The co-mingling, however, has produced a unique sound that is closer to true rock-and-roll than anything on the market today. As with any first album, there will be kinks to work out, but I don't think you can go wrong with purchasing this, and I predict they will only get better. Rock on!"
5,Chris Cornell Rocks On,"Not a HUGE Rage fan, I too was skeptical about the collaboration of Chris Cornell and the three members of Rage. WOW, was I blown away! In the faster/harder songs, it is interesting to hear a fabulous combination of the unmistakable guitar/rhythm work of Rage and vocals that take me back to early Soundgarden. The slower songs showcase the depth and creativity of Chris Cornell's solo work, as well as his soothing lower vocal range, which is like if silk had a sound. And once again, as with every project Chris Cornell is involved with, this album shows that Cornell has by far the best rock voice ever."
1,Bad Idea,"I don't understand the excitement over this and all the hype like it's the savior of rock. This is Tom Morello at his worst, and the rest of Rage at their dullest and most monotonous. BTW, Soundgarden's Kim KILLS Tom if you use this album as a comparison. Only those who don't play guitar themselves would think otherwise. Cochise is the only descent song on the album. The rest of it sounds like Soundgarden, but drained of all musical ingenuity.And I really don't understand those who keep disrespecting de la Rocha in their reviews here. Especially those who say that he held Tom Morello back -- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. Morello was FAR more progressive with Rocha in front.This corporate merger is an EMBARRASSMENT to rock because it blew so much potential to be something great."
2,Not Rage By A Longshot,How wonderful was it to see the band of RATM back together minus Zack. However I was disappointed in this album because I expected the intensity and energy that Zack gave to Rage. It is just not present in this album with the new singer. I am also biased towards the lyrics of Rage. Don't buy this album if your expecting something along the lines of Rage because it doesn't measure up.
2,Disappointing,"I was a huge RATM fan, and while I was shocked when they broke up, I tried to look at it as a way for the remaining members to explore different creative avenues. These three play together as well as always, and they retain their familiar style. While I wasn't expecting another RATM, the vocals here do not mesh, or blend well with the music. They seem to clash, instead of work together to make an enjoyable album. A perfect example of this is track 6, ""Set It Off"". The song starts out great, and I almost expect Zack to come in spitting rhymes, but instead, Cornell comes in. Instead of flowing with the song, he comes in and takes over, almost pushing his way to the forefront. In the end, maybe this album just wasn't for me."
2,RATM is better...,"After listening to Audioslave, I am confident in saying RATM is better, much, much better. RATM's singer has a much better voice, and I like the way the guitarist (same in both AS and RATM) plays better in RATM.Conclusion: Get any of RATM's CDs instead of this. End of story."
2,Blah,"So you say this band is comprised of memebers of Rage Against the Machine, one of the most innovative metal bands of all time, and Soundgarden, probably the best grunge band of all time? Well, what are you expecting?Are you expecting either:A) FAST-PACED guitars, SWEET basslines, KICKIN' drums, and some IN YOUR FACE vocals/rapping/lyrics? or...B) SLOW, GRINDING guitars, DEEP, DARK bass, INTENSE drumming, and DEPRESSING vocals/lyrics? or...C) A REALLY boring band.If you're expecting A or B, don't be surprised that Audioslave is probably the most boring band you'll ever hear. If you're expecting C, you're in for a treat! They're just PRETTY boring, and easily ignorable."
2,How to destroy a band,"I really curious about this one: I love rage against the machine. But then... I started to listen to it...F***, it is Soundgarden stuff! Lyrics with no meaning at all, that super-solos of Morello just ripped apart and it's kind of a agressive-free music with the lighter-asking songs.I can't believe that Chris Cornell could just change a work of a lifetime, Rage Against the Machine is now a legend. Audioslave is just a regular band that would be a garage band if the elements weren't VIP's.Just buy Battle of L.A. if you want some real stuff."
5,Perfect Blend,"I must admit when I first heard Chris Cornell was teaming up with the remaining members of RAGE, I was skeptical. But this album is the perfect blend of true musicians. This is one of the best albums of the year in my opinion. The mix sounds like what I thought Euphoria Morning was going to sound like, but Cornell was a little too mellow on that album. Here he is back to his old Soundgarden days of screaming and the high pitch we loved on Superunknown. Being a fan of both RAGE and Soundgarden, this album could be considered the followup to Down on the Upside - If Soundgarden were still together, and the followup to Renegades - only BETTER.This album has many tunes that you definitely hear the RAGE guitar you are used to, and mixed with Chris's voice, it is a perfect album. I highly recommend this CD to anyone that is a Sondgarden or RAGE fan, you WON'T (or shouldn't) be disappointed."
5,Soundgarden + RATM = Too good to be true!,"I will admit that at first glance, i didn't think this band would be able to work together. Two years ago, my brother told me that Chris Cornell was going to replace Zack De La Rocha. I didn't believe him because Cornell never wrote songs about politics and what not. When I got Audioslave, Tom Morello proved to me that he is THE BEST GUITAR PLAYER IN THE WORLD AS OF NOW! He also proved that it doesn't matter who's singing. People are getting sick and tired of these new bands ... I'm finally glad to see ORIGINAL artists do their thing and blow the untalented competition away."
3,It's Ok...3.5 stars,"Before i say anything about the band, i want to say that Rage Against the Machine is one of my favorite bands and Soundgarden is awesome. That having been said i must say that, although this is a great effort, it just doesnt compare in my mind to Rage or Soundgarden. The intros sound a lot like Rage intros, owing to the fact that Tom Morello is doing them, and it doesn't seem original enough. When listening to some of the songs, when they start out i can't tell if it's Audioslave or Rage, and then it turns into a question of Audioslave or Soundgarden. I've given them 3 stars because it's a pretty good album by anybody else, but seeing what the members have done before it doesn't seem as good(and because there's no half star). All are great musicians but it isn't much a new sound just a combo of the other two bands, not enough new stuff."
4,Audioslave: Rock to the Core,"This is the first Audioslave album with a follow up due to be released in May 2005. I took a gamble on purchasing this CD not really knowing what to expect. However, I can literally say this is an amazing album release. These band members are talented and there is no doubt about that. The album track listing starts off with Cochise which has a heavy set Rock theme. The styles of each song differs and its differances is what makes this album stand out. Several of these songs like Show Me How To Live, What You Are and Shadow On The Sun have become radio staples. Or for the more hard rock fans, the songs like Cochise, Set If Off and Exploder will suit them.Personally I found that this album has it all, punk rock, soft rock, hard rock with alittle bit of grunge added in to spice up the flavour. I enjoy listening to this CD and any fan of Nickelback or Creed should enjoy this helping from Audioslave."
5,A masterpiece!!,"I love Soundgarden, I love Rage. Audioslave is the best of both worlds. It took me a few listens to get adjusted to the new sound, but the album keeps getting better every time I listen to it. There isn't a single filler song here. I find that the best bands take more than one listen to appreciate. Heck, I didn't like Soundgarden and Rage when I first heard them, but now they are two of my favorite bands ever. Chris Cornell has one of the most expressive voices I ever heard. To really appreciate the greatness that is Audioslave, you need to put their CD in a good stereo system and crank it up loud!"
4,"""voice of SOUNDGARDEN, power of R.A.T.M""","....over all i love Audioslave.it took awhile for me to come to terms with Chris's voice. I definitly prefer Zach. but i like this new road Tom, Tim and Brad are taking. it lets them branch out from the rap metal they've been doing for years, and proves that when it comes to just plain hard rock. they can blow all these new bands out of the water. if you want a proper rethro rock band (resembling Led Zeppelin) then Audioslave is it. Forget the ""the..."" bands. they've got too much arogance and not enough talent when compared to the 'mature' RATM and Soundgarden crossbreed.this album is not going to appeal to everyone. but that's just another reason why it's one of my new favourites."
4,Definately for the Chris Cornell fan,"This is standard Chris Cornell. If you even heard of his Euphoria Morning solo album, you'll like this one. The remainder of the boys from Rage due a spectacular job on this recording, but I don't think it will appeal to the hardcore Rage Against the Machine fan, who will most likely miss Zack's rapping and Rage's trademark sound. I highly recommend it for the Cornell fan thought."
2,You call this a great CD?,"I have to admit that the music in this CD is pretty good, but when Chris Cornell's voice comes in, it just totally ruins everything. You're lucky i gave this 2 stars. It should really only have a half star, but i felt i needed to at least give credit to the former Rage members who can actually play music. Chris Cornell, find some other band to screw up with, instead of making these guys listen to your horrible voice."
3,Cornell and Rage...I am not sure,"This was supposed to be the coming together of one of the most talented vocalists on the planet at this time with a very talented band.The disc is a disc worth having for Cornell fans, but it is not as mind blowing as I had expected, the collaboration of some of the nations top musicians should be something that could and should rival the old leaders like the Beatles or The Stones, yet we get something that is rage with a SInger, not a rapper now. I hope the next album comes out a lot stronger."
2,Slave to the grind,2 1/2Only a few tracks can rise above a tyrannical sludge pulsating in predictable time- elevating this particular supergroup only slightly above the stale stylings of a Velvet Revolver.
1,This is for all the na sayers,"I just bought the Audioslave album and i think it a very good album. I don't know why people are comparing audioslave to nickleback or creed, they are totally different. No way was this made for commercial success. It is definitely one of the better albums of the year. Im a big fan of both rage and soundgarden and when i heard of this combo i was all over it and was not disappointed. yes there are several dry tracks on the album that are dry but overall it is very very good. A must have for any rage or soundgarden fan..."
1,Mixing Soundgarden with R.A.T.M is Like Mixing Oil and Water,"I first want to say that R.A.T.M was one of my favorite bands of all time, and still is. I loved their purposeful lyrics mixed with the distinctive R.A.T.M sound. I think that Zach WAS R.A.T.M, and as soon as he left I knew the band couldn't live on without him. The way he sang with his raspy voice you could feel the hate and rage of the lyrics. And mix that with Tom's crazy guitar playing and you have the unique sound only R.A.T.M could produce. The band itself still has it, but when you mix their sound with Chris Cornell it is horrible. R.A.T.M was all about the rap/metal sound, and mixing that with Cris Cornell's alt-rock voice doesn't work. I think that these guys will forever be looked at as ""the 3 remaining members of R.A.T.M and Soundgarden's lead singer"" and never just the band Audioslave. I don't see this band lasting for a little more than a year. P.S- that name is horrible, is that the best they could come up with?"
3,Nothing special....,"I bought this album with high expectations, but I've gotta say that, except for the first two tracks, this is nothing but average rock. ""Cochise"", their first single, compelled me to buy this CD, along with stellar reviews, for a not-so-stellar album. After ""Show me How to live"" the second track, the songs all begin to sound the same. The lyrics are rather uninspired ""I'll wait for you here/Like a stone"", and Chris Cornell's gravelly yet somehow whiny voice begins to get old pretty quick. Instead of buying ""Audioslave"" I would download the ""Cochise"" video(it's really unbelievable...during the filming, the LAPD got calls from concerned citizens who thought that LA was under attack...that's just how many fireworks were used) and maybe ""Show me how to Live"" Other than that, there's much better musaic to buy out there."
2,"It's not terrible, but definately not for RATM fans.","If you're a big Rage fan I guarantee you probably won't like this album. I know I didn't. Tom, Tim and Brad are perfect together (Zack is perfect with them too), but I don't know about Chris. Chris changed the sound quite a bit. If you like Soundgarden get this, but if you like Rage Against the Machine, don't get this. If you like both... get it, but expect more Soundgarden than Rage."
5,It doesn't get any better!,One of only a few all time classic albums to come out this century. If your a fan of rock or looking to expand your musical tastes give it a try.
4,The two worked...Worked great,"There are only a few things that gel great together when each has different experience. Audioslave is one of them. When you take the musical talent of Rage Against The Machine and you add the voice of Soundgarden what have you got.....You've got Rock & Roll! This album is not like Rage or the Garden, I prefer to call it a work of art. The different melodies explored by the two groups and the hard feel of the band make this album one to add to your collection. From the pounding introduction and classic guitar of Tom Morello in ""Cochise"" to the melodic content in ""I am the Highway"", back to the explosive rock you expect and hoped for in ""Light my Way."" This album is worth the Andrew Jackson it sells for. Get up and get your copy now! This Album kick's @ss and was definitely worth the wait. It's all about making noise."
3,"Rage fans, don't bother with this one","Rage fans, this album will probably disappoint you. Now we see all too well that the fiery vocal talents of Zach de la Rocha combined with Tom Morello's innovative stylings of the guitar were nothing short of genius. This is such a disappointing effort from such a brilliant rocker (Morello) and amazing vocalist (Cornell). Missing from this album are musical or political relevance. What is left on the album is diluted, confused, pseudo grunge-era metal and watered-down Rage remnants. Unfortunately, it just does NOT rock hard enough. So very sad from two bands that delivered so much raw power and meaning to music in the last decade...."
5,Audioslave debuts a hit cd,"Audioslave has reached a new level in rock. With the Rage Against the Machine in the band, there is no problems with the music. The lead singer has one of the coolest voices ive heard. Audioslave is pretty good all the way around. There are no weak songs on the whole CD. Some of my favorites are Like A Stone, I Am The Highway, and Getawy Car. The onbe song that got me hooked on this group is Cochise. Not sure what it means but it one of my favorites. If you like any of the songs they have on the radio, you will love this CD.ROCK ON AUDIOSLAVE!"
4,You won't be hearing any of these songs on American Idol,"As far as I was concerned hard rock peaked with ""Purple"" from Stone Temple Pilots. Thanks to Audioslave my faith has been restored. This is one of the first albums in a very long time where I don't find myself skipping tracks. Chris Cornell has still got it as one of the most distinguishable voices in rock and roll. I liked some of Rage's stuff but not enough to buy an album. After lisenting to this, I am now a bonfide Tom Morello fan and relize he was the reason behind my limited appeal to Rage. Even though all are good, my favorite tracks are ""Show Me How To Live"", ""Gasoline"", ""Set it Off"", and ""I am the Highway."" A refreshingly sincere and profound effort for its genre. It's nice to know that there is still a quality hard rock alternative to the Top 40 schlock out there."
1,Oh Sweet Irony,"Sure. Some of these songs are a little catchy. But honestly, how did Chris Cornell think this was a good idea? Audioslave is Rage doing a Nickelback impression and Chris Cornell writing lyrics straight out of the late 90s mold of horrible, devirative hard rock like 3 Doors Down, or god, even Creed. The horror.If you were ever a fan of ANY of these musicians, do yourself a favor and never buy this. The originals are ripping off the rip offs. Aye curumba."
3,"Alright, it's time you all learn a lesson.","You people that are complaining should stop being so immature. Grow up, get a life. Soundgarden isn't getting back together. Rage isn't getting back together. This is what they wanted to do, and there's no way for you to stop it. Sure, it's not the best CD, but I can handle it. And I'm not going to go and complain about it. That's useless. Sure, it's not the best CD, but I can handle it. I'll listen to a couple of songs on it once in a while. My main reason to write this was to get this message through to you . . . you're all so freaking immature."
3,it just don't works at all,"Members of Rage against the machine collaborating with legendary Chris Cornell of soundgarden - that could be exciting.But sadly it sounds like some remake of their old songs.i don't know who's fault is it but ""Chochise"" and some tracks that are closest to hteir older style are simply boring.the best tracks i found here were more catchy and modern rock that agressive riff-shouting rage melodies.""Like a stone"",""I am a highway"" and ""What you are"" are really great rock tunes with a lot of great rhythm section and guitars.Chris Cornell on vocals sounds really superb there.as a whole album Audioslave made something that sounds great only in few moments.the rest is good but totally what you could expect 5 years ago from Rage against the machine.that is why it is boring a bit - only once you can make revolution in rock music - when repeated it starts to be unoriginal and sleepy.That's what hapened to audioslave.good music but nothing brand new. buy or not - the chioce is yours..."
2,Have to agree with Jay Stevens here,"It lacks the fire of both early Soundgarden and early RATM. The songs are there, they sound like ""rock"", but they also sound like the very reason kids today are looking elsewhere.There is nothing here you haven't heard already, but that would be excusable if it just had a little fire going. Rock'n'roll is yelling into a microphone with a loud wailing guitar and a thundering base. Here we have the dictionary definition of rock'n'roll, sans anything that would endear the listener. What made Soundgarden and RATM great is what makes this mediocre. That both bands were waning before this is notable.They only sound truly inspired every so many songs, and usually they can't even get a full 4 minutes out of it. The sound is great, the chops are there, and the music goes in one ear and out the other."
2,Yawn...,"To be honest, most modern rock bores the tears out of me. So much of it follows the same old tired formula that it is reduced to nothing more than heavy pop. Soundgarden was one band in the genre that always managed to overcome this and caputure my attention. So Audioslave comes along...it sounds like Soungarden minus the latter bands uniqueness, and so it comes of as just another dull mordern rock album...well played, nothing terrible, Chris Cornell's voice is still wonderful...but if I want to listen to Soundgarden I'll listen to Soundgarden, thank you. This must be the year of failed supergroups as Zwan (aka, the new Smashing Pumpkins)'s debut is a likewise decent yet dull modern rock album."
5,Breath of fresh air,Audioslave is a great example of what's been lacking in the hard rock world lately; A kick-a** band with a singer who has real vocal ability.
3,Nice To Hear Chris Wail Again,"It's good, though it's not Badmotorfinger or Evil Empire. It'snot even an idea of either. It's nice to hear Chris wailhis heart out again...I am a fan of both, but more soa fan of Chris Cornell...The musicis all 'RAGE',the vox are all 'SG' so it's pretty much what youwill expect to hear. A few nice surprises are the ballads.But fans of Temple Of The Dog or Chris' Euphoria Morningwill recognize this style. If you get a chance to listen beforeyou buy, I'd recommend that."
2,coulda been so much more,I love Soundgarden and I love Rage Against the Machine but this album was a let down on so many levels. Most would assume that if you combine two great elements from two great bands you would get a decent product in return however this wasnt the case. Audioslave's debut album is in no way a bad album just a dissapointing one. All the songs felt so flat and unispired compared to past rage or soundgarden material. Cornell's voice and Morello's guitars never seemed to shine on this c.d. and the whole experience was quite lackluster. I can only hope in future recordings the band can recapture what truly made them great in the first place.
1,You've gotta be kidding,"Cochise is classic rock, no doubt. But the rest of this album is just more mediocre, generic, alternative BS. If you dug Rage, you will NOT dig this. This is more like luke-warm Soundgarden. Chris' vocals on this are unbearingly monotonous. The rhythm section is far from driving. And it's sad to hear Morello's playing so watered down.I wish I could give this effort negative stars."
2,nothing to get excited about.,"Everybody is praising this band for being one of the best out there. But my question is why? If the members of this band were not formerly from very successful bands, I can guarantee you they would not get all of the love they are receiving. This CD is boring, choppy, and unoriginal. It is better than a small quantity of its competition, but lacks in interest and creavtity."
2,Disappointing,"With one or two exceptions, sounds way too much like Soundgarden. I was hoping for a more balanced mix between Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but this CD has that monotone depressed feel that kept Soundgarden from being enjoyable when listened to."
5,enslaved!,Audioslave has been a real revealation.each track worth listening dozens of time.'Like a stone' sounds absolutely magical.Listen to this album and youre sure to get enslaved!Thumbs up ;-)
3,Needs to sound rawer.,"Rage Against The Machine and Soundgardens music sounded much better than this.The thing is, those two bands actually sounded real,but this album is way to polished sounding, with squeaky clean guitar effects from Tom Morrelo, and it is also quite mainstream, which if you have any musical sense - is very very bad.What would of made this album better.Raw, and a more real sounding production to their music that would of turned off mainstream music audiences and made them a real sounding band - as good as Sound Garden and Rage Agains the machine.Tom Morrelo should of had his Guitar turned up with some proper real distortion and Chris Cornell could of sounded less like a roaring and droning dragon.Heres hoping the next one will be better."
2,Dissapointing,"When I heard these guys were getting together I was excited. The guys from Rage getting together with Chris Cornell, it couldn't any better than that right? Wrong. When I first heard Cochise all the excitment that built up inside of me prior to the release of this album immediatly dissapeared. The guitar riff sounds like a half assed Rage riff and the vocals aren't that good. I couldn't get into this song at all. I knew Audioslave wasn't going to be Rage Against the Machine, but I thought it would be a lot better than what it is. Rage's music was filled with anger, emotion, powerful lyrics, earth shaking bass lines and drum beats, and brilliant guitar riffs. Audioslave is just flat out boring. Like a Stone is a perfect example of an extremely boring song. Everyone thinks these guys are gonna ""save rock"", but I just think they're overrated and boring."
5,Preliminary review,"I was a huge fan of Rage Against the Machine, so I was disappointed when Zack de la Rocha left. However, when news of Chris Cornell joining on to create a new band, I was very excited. After many months of hard work, Audioslave was born. This album is the fruits of their labor. The change of singers makes a big difference, as Zack's rap/rock is gone and Chris's more forceful rock takes its place. The lyrics are less politically charged, but still meaningful (such as ""Go and save yourself/take it out on me"" from Cochise).Cochise, their first single, is definitely the most popular song at this point...Definitely check this CD out if you like rock... this CD is a must buy. Highly recommended!"
1,what the,"when i heard some songs on this album... i was like...where is de la roche. truely, he was awesome. audioslaves singer doenst compare with roche. i want ratm back. also, tom morello doesnt seem like he likes the damn music anyways.ac"
1,What has RAGE done to themselves?,"Sweet mother of God, this is not what the members of post-Zack Rage Against the Machine should be doing. Don't take this personally, Soundgarden fans--Chris Cornell not only has the worst rock voice I've ever heard, he simply doesn't belong with the Rage musicians. I'm giving this thing a little credit because the instrumentalists are still blowing me away--but a guy like Cornell doesn't belong in Zack de la Rocha's honorable rapcore position. Period."
1,What a crapper!,This was one of the biggest dissapointments that I have ever purchased. This truly certifies that Rage is done forever. Rage and Cornell dont fit. This Cd is one of the most depressing things I have ever listened to.
5,Audioslave...the current KINGS of Rock 'n Roll,"This CD is fantastic. Chris Cornell is probably the best vocalist in Rock right now and when he teams up with Rage Against the Machine what's not to love? The CD is awesome. Some are very good hard rock songs (Set it Off, Cochise, Gasoline) and some are nice mellow songs like Like a Stone.And talk about creativity. If you are tired of the same old rock listen to some Audioslave. ""Show me how to Live"" is one of my favorite songs just because the music is so original.This is a truly excellent CD.They are also a very very good live band."
2,Supergroup - Whatever,Putting aside their Anti-American Politics this is not a good cd. This is a mellow Soundgarden cd at best. How many times can bands rehash Led Zepplin stuff? This is a bloated and boring cd. Most of the songs are very Soundgarden-ish when they were at their commercial best writing drippy ballads. There is no fury or angst or passion - this is an uninspired cd that is cashing in on the names of Soundgarden and RATM. Do yourself a favor and save your money.
5,Audioslave,"I believe the new Audioslave cd is incredible. However, based on other reviews which i've observed, too many Rage Against The Machine and Soundgarden fans were expecting this cd to be one of the two. Realize, that although these bands are joined, they still formed to make a new one. Therefore, it's going to be different, which i beleive was the main and comprehensible goal. This is a wonderful cd from begining to end and i highly recommend it."
5,Audioslave,"The soldiers have redeemed themselves once more. The audioslave album is reminsicent of Led Zeppelin and will become a rock classic in the future. The powerful guitars lead by Tom Morello and vocals by Chris Cornell are astounding. Tim C. carrys the bottom end on bass and Brad keeps the rhythm on drums. Wonderful cd, a must for any music lover."
5,Incredible,"I'll admit, when I heard the first couple of singles from this album I thought it sounded like Chris Cornell singing for Rage Against the Machine. But if you get past the radio hits, which are still good songs, it sounds like an entirely new band. Audioslave is proof that older rockers can still be relevent in today's Nu Metal world without selling out. This album is a masterpiece!"
4,Slighty Above Average,"What can I say about this album other than it kicks major ...! One of the best albums of 2,002! I've waited for this album for a long time & I can't say it is a disappointment. Although I am kind of sick of ""Cochise"" & ""Like A Stone"". My favorite song off the cd is the most likely unknown song on the album called ""Shadow of the Sun"". I also like the ballad ""I Am The Highway"" only on the account of its not getting that much radio play but I have heard it a couple of times including ""Show Me How To Live"". Those are all great tracks as well but you can't forget about ""Gasoline"", ""What You Are"", ""Set It Off"", & the one I have already mentioned ""Shadow of the Sun"". All I can say that this the first half of the CD is really good then it starts to go downhill."
2,Not A Substitute For Rage,"I checked out this album because I like Rage, but it didn't sufice for me. I guess I was just hoping for a ""return"" of Rage and didn't get it."
4,hasnt missed a beat,"well its been about 7 or so years since soundgarden and not too long since rage against the machine and there was a lot of skeptisism for this band but it was all put away. audioslave may have been the album of 2003. not only did it draw in soundgarden and RAM fans but also the mainstream with their hit, like a stone. ive been a fan of soundgarden so i got this cd and i was totally impressed. neither RAM nor Cornell really changed the way they worked. if cornell didnt sing people would think it was RAM. that os what makes this album beutiful. Though its not a classic, if they put out another album im sure to pick it up"
2,not the same without zach,"when i heard that rage against the machine (RATM) broke up, i was disapionted. they had so much raw intensity and such meaningful, truthful, and radical lyrics. but when i heard that they were commin back with chris cornell as a vocalist...i thought it would be a good idea to check em out. little did i know that this record was not even close to the old rage stuff. putting chris cornell with rage is like putting justin timperlake with slipknot...it just dosent work. i think the band as a whole grew musically, however it would have been better if they grew along with zach, its like the band grew but the vocalist went strait down the tubes. anyone who is thinking about buying this record because you're a rage fan, i recomend that you think about it and stick with rage instead...cuz they are alot better. BULLS ON PARADE!!!"
3,Disappointing,"Though Audioslave's debut album has a handful of choice cuts, the over all quality of this record is average at best. There's not one challenging moment or shred of originality here. I don't believe the members of Audioslave truly believe in what they're doing and it shows. Tom Morello, one of my favorite guitarists of all time, sounds gimmicky throughout, not groundbreaking or awe inspiring like his RATM days. Cornell sounds good as usual, but even his solo album ""Euphoria Morning"" has more heart that this.On the brighter side of things, track #2, ""Show Me How To Live,"" is superb!"
1,Not as good as I hoped,I was hoping a combination of Chris Cornell and Rage would of produced a better album ! It's ok but Chris conned them into putting a couple of bad style songs he put on his 2 solo cds!Hopefully next time they can do better!
4,Have you noticed?,"Great album. One question though: is it just me, or dose Cochise sound a lot like Whole Lotta Love? Go back and forth between the two songs and you'll know what I mean."
4,The album that started it all...,"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and it was good. On the eighth day, he created Audioslave. And it was good. And there was much rejoicing in the land.Ok, this band is not quite of biblical proportions, but they're only a step or two below. With the exception of a few sub-par tracks (thats why this a 4-starrer and not a fiver) this is great first try. ""Cochise,"" ""Show Me How to Live,"" ""Exploder,"" ""Shine On,"" ""I Am the Highway,"" the parade of awesome tracks is seemingly endless. That said, things at times feel funny, like Cornell and the band aren't quite together on everything, but that's forgivable. However, there's an alternate cut of ""I Am the Highway"" floating around that is markedly better than the one that ended up on the album. But my complaints are generally few and minor.Things would be more solid the second time around, but their brightest moments to date came in this slightly more scattershot, but very good, album."
4,¡Que buena combinación!,"Combinación explosiva la de Cornell y los de RATM, con este proyecto dan un buen ejemplo de que hay mucho rock por delante"
5,Audioslave,"This album was amazing. The contrasting styles made it interesting to listen to. Tom Morello has to be one of the greatest guitar players ever, and he showed it on this album not only through his crazy guitar sounds and larger than life riffs, but through the diversity of the styles he plays in. He can go from a riff-heavy song right into a very bluesy song. Chris Cornell is amazing as always and I espically liked the way he sounded on the slower songs. The rythem section is amazing as always with the solid drumming of brad wilk and the great bass playing of tim commerford. This is an amazing album. It should be in your collection."
5,Really good,This is a very good album and has great songs on it. It's the sound of Rage mixed with the voice of Soundgarden. These 2 forces make an incredible duo in there new debut. This is a great buy for rock fans. You won't regret it!
2,"""The expert wanna be"" The band is okay but lead singer sucks",I like some of their music but the lead singer jsut can't handle the songs that they play and they aren't bad but this is just what I think. If you like rock music with a weak voice then listen to it. Hate me if you want but that is how I feel about it.
2,Possibly the MOST overrated band on the planet,"They're just not very good. Maybe the radio is more to blame than the band but Audioslave doesn't even hold a candle to Soundgarden OR Rage Against the Machine. Plain and simple, this band [stinks]."
1,lets see.... nope.,Rage Against the Machine plus Soundgarden minus all talent and innovation equals Audioslave! YAY!
2,Just not the same,let me first get something straight. I love Rage Against the Machine and SOundgarden. However Chris Cornells voice just does not suit RATM's style of music. The music is good but vocally this album is very poor. When your on to a good thing stick to it.
2,"Too hard, not enough melody","I don't normally listen to wailing, hard-edged bands anymore, but Soundgarden's ""Superunknown"" is a stellar album and for an album with such a hard edge, the songs were damn catchy and moving. This album, however, had very little that stayed with me. ""Like a Stone,"" the main single from this album, ended up being the only song I liked. Most of the other songs were just hard guitar wailing combined with screaming vocals with few melody hooks to speak of. If you normally like this sort of music then that might be OK, but for the rest of us... sorry. So for those of you who are NOT ashamed to admit that you mostly stick to ""mainstream"" music, like myself, I doubt that you'd like this album. But try it for yourself I guess. I'm done with Chris Cornell, hardcore, metal, and punkbands myself. Call me getting older, but I don't care, there's just too much good music out there to waste on this sort of stuff."
5,Breath of Fresh Air,"We've been waiting for this album for a long time. The union of Chris Cornell and the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine have mixed the right ingredients to cook up a great sounding band. This album goes some places that you would not expect musically, and makes for a great listening experience. From heavy or political, to pensive, there is not a track that should be skipped over. This is exactly how I hoped it would sound when I heard of the band. It will be in my cd player for awhile."
1,"Typical, boring, mainstream, etc.... no saviors of rock here","holy crap i listened to some of these songs on napster and i got a headache and almost went to sleep. Boring, boring, BORING! Even the ""heavy"" grunge tracks are boring. All the tracks are typical mainstream rock songs. Im sorta a fan of Rage, their alot more energetic and have more EXCITING guitar riffs. If you want real innovative, rock music check out PRIMUS (all hail les claypool, best bassist ever), Dream Theatre (cool prog rock), Red hot chili peppers (the masters of funk rock), Lostprophets (their kinda mainstream but at least you can listen to it without being bored), and for harder stuff definatley older metallica and for metal the swedish band In Flames (awesome guitars and singing) THIS IS CRAP"
1,HAHA You call this rock????!!!! How can you,"Give me Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones or even David Lee Roth over this, it has no appeal, it is mindless noise, how the hell can you call this rock, Cornell drones as annoyingly as Kurt Cobain, this band is trying to emulate a time that left long ago in the 70s and 80s, and isn't coming back unless the true rock legends wake up and blow these fools off the stage, they are no better than Korn, Slipknot or even Rage themselves... check your ears this album [smells], there is no true element of rock and roll in it, its BORING, i thought rock and roll was a mirror of the times, we must have pretty...boring times to produce this!!! BRING BACK THE REAL ROCK!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!"
1,Extremely annoying,"How can anyone like this? Its not catchy, it doesn't sound good, and the lead singer ""sings"" so friggin annoying."
1,Horrible!,"Wow, what a dreary and bland album.Rage Against The Machine members and Soundgardens Chris Cornell could of done something a bit more unploished and exciting rather than this nicely packaged album full of squeaky clean guitar solos - Boring and bland!Bring back ""Zack De La Cockroach!!!"" - no offence, its actually a very cool name.Chris Cornell should of just started his own new band thankyou very much.Get ""Euphoria Morning"" thats an outstanding album."
2,Major Disappointment,"I had never heard much of Soundgarden's stuff, but I am a big Rage fan. I didn't like this album one bit. RATM without Zach isn't RATM and that is VERY obvious in their debut. Zach had the perfect style for Rage that Cornell just doesn't have. Also, taking the political bent out of the music removed a good deal of the fire and passion that Rage had. Very disappointing, maybe one of the worst albums I've heard all year."
1,Unpleasantly surprised,"I got this album hoping that it would be very similar to my Rage Against the Machine ones. However, this is not how it turned out. The new singer's style is so mainstream I found myself retching. And the lyrics have lost all of their power as well. What happened to the Renegades I once knew? Where is Zach de la Rocha?"
4,Audioslave kicks ass,"This is the winner album all the way. Ever since chris cornell signed in along with RATM, it was destined o be a winner. I Didnt understand why the former grunge merchants soundgarden disbanded in the first place but this album can be heralded as the return of grunge.Right from the beginning of the first track cochise this album rocks hard, except the slow I am the Highway. Tom morello is in fine form making maximum use of dropped D tuning on his guitar( as was typical of all the Seattle bands during they golden era of mid 90s, to sample dropped D I recommend to take a listen to the album ""Strap it on "" by Helmet).However the drummer sounded a bit weak (no comparison to Matt Cameron).Overall the album is worth a buy and the tracks get better after listening couple of times."
5,Best cd I've bought in years,"The fusing of Chris Cornell, and Rage Against the Machine to form Audioslave is unbelieveable! First time I listened to the entire CD, I liked EVERY song, and I can't say that about many CD's. Chris is so talented, and somehow they manage to almost sound like a completely different band with each song. The rhythms, and the lyrics are tight, and entrancing. I can't say enough about this CD!"
4,Great match,"Chris Cornell and Rage musicians move toward a new territory in this album. Hearing both Soundgarden and Rage influences it's inevitable and actually something you expect. Powerful guitars from Morello, Cornell's voice taken to the limit with more insightfur lyrics. When you hear it you think that they didn't care what the fans would say. They reached my expectations."
5,Sunning Debut Album,"I bought this album being a fan of both Soundgarden and RATM. I admit that when I first put it into my Cd player I didn't quite know what to expect, I didn't think that Cornell's voice and the members of Rage's hip-hop fused playing would gel well. How wrong was I? This album is amazing. Cornell's voice is amazing and his lyrics are some of the best he's written in years. The rhythm section of Tim and Brad are also great adding a muscular base to Morello's Led Zeppelin esque riffery. I could rant about this album all day but that would waste your time as, if you dont have this album you really should go out and buy it, now!!!"
5,RATM with a new flavor,"Audioslave is one of the few good merger bands. Taking Chris Cornell and throwing in Rage Against the Machine band members was a great idea. With this album, you get the same great riffs that Rage Against the Machine fans have come to expect, mixed with a different flavor of vocals. While the rapping vocals of RATM's Zach de la Rocha definitely will be missed, Chris Cornell pulls through with his awesome voice."
5,Absolutely THE BEST album of 2002 (and so far 2003...),"I'm showing my age a little bit here, but for a good cause: I can't get into rap, and to me the new metal sounds like chords and growling. Godsmack is OK. Metallica is trying to win their old fans with St. Anger -- but forgot to include guitar solos. Pearl Jam is falling into an awful abyss with Vedder's mic turned up trying to sound like Neil Young and Gossard pounding the strings as if he would rather be somewhere else.It's a dark reminder that Mad Season was long ago, Temple of the Dog even farther back. Tool is still kicking around, but there are some long breathers between releases. Slayer and Anthrax are keeping the pulse... Mostly I miss Soundgarden.Rare and brilliant gems appear here and there in time, like Audioslave. These efforts make the drive to work bearable. They give you something to talk about with your friends. They smooth over bad new releases that leave you feeling ripped off."
5,Audioslve,"This is an awesome cd! The whole cd is fantastic,there isn't one bad song on the whole cd.The vocals and the guitar work is excellent!! Audioslave was such a good band, its a shame they went their seperate ways. Chris Cornell has been one of my favorite vocalists since I first heard Soundgarden many years ago."
2,"The soul of rage still Burns, but Cornell is killing Rage slowly","This Review goes to all Audioslave's work not just this album being their 1st albumi have both of the albums and quite frankly, out of 26 songs over the 2 albums i only like 6 of their songsi personally think Tom Morrello, Y Tim K and Brad Wilks coulda done a lot better handing their talents over to someone with way more talent like trent reznor who i consider a rock legend think of what Trent Reznor, Tom Morello, Brad Wilks and Y Tim K could of done instead of someone with far less talenti hate having to rubbish originally what was such a good formula but Cornell should be given the bootC'MON RAGE BRING BACK ROCK TO HOW YOU GUYS USED TO DO IT!!even if you have to bring the voice back one more time(Like thats gonna happen)"
2,Fairly Average,I was Hyped with Chris Cornell&Tom Morello both United here.I enjoy Cornell's Vocie&Mrello's Guitar Playing but something about the material after a while feels Formula driven.Rage was Cool but I dug Soundgarden more so.hopefully they will get it right on the Next album.
3,I WANT RAGE BACK!!!!!,"Audioslave is a grand band....but i am a HUGE Rage fan and i nearly killed myself when i found out that they broke up, for now. This Cd is a very good one, but now what i expected totally. In my opinion it is an OK CD. Great guitar work...."
4,Audioslave,"Being a fan of both Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, I was so amped for this album to come out. I had followed news of the union of Chris Cornell and the remaining members of Rage, and had the ""Civilian"" disc. When I got the Audioslave cd, I couldn't believe how different it was from the Civilian cd, now I understood why they were so upset when it leaked on the net!!Tom Morello knocks me down again, I swear that Cochise has one of the best beginnings to a song, right up there with Korn's Blind. And although it took me a little while to adjust to Chris Cornell singing instead of Zach De La Rocha, soon I was appreciating Audioslave for exactly that, being Audioslave. Not Rage and not Soundgarden, but their own new hybrid type of music. And it's good too, and that's hard to come by lately. This cd just makes me feel good about a lot of things, and things to come as well!"
4,like a stone,"Wow...i'm not a good review writer, but reading through the reviews, i didn't see one mention of the 5th track ""Like a Stone""...it was this track that made me buy the album..I had to chime in on that...i thought this track had great melody, great energy, and the best solo on the album especially cuz it totally clicked w/the rest of the song..buy this album and listen to that track..the rest of the songs are worth listening to as well...a good collaboration between Cornell and the 3 RATM members that satisfies fans of Soundgarden and RATM."
5,Wow! Not what I expected -- Much better!,"After hearing ""Cochise"" on the radio, I was expecting this album to be Rage Against the Machine but with Cornell instead of Zach.Except for a few tracks, I was wrong.Without hearing it, you may not be able to imagine it - but take the best of both Soundgarden and RATM and you get an idea of what this album is like.The only thing I miss is the politically charged lyrics. I guess I can wait until Zach de la Rocha puts out his solo album.Highly recommended!"
4,should have,Not as good as any Soundgarden or RATM but still very good rock and roll. Anyone that likes either of the former bands whose members make up Audioslave should have this CD.
1,please,"this album is pure 100% crap. i'm not just comparing it to RATM but just as an album. the guitar is horrible, drums are painfully dead, vocals annoying, and the lyrics are shallow and just plain stupid. ""i am a highway"". doesn't that mean he has construction workers and roadkill all over him? plz don't buy this piece."
1,ruined the essence of RAGE,"First of all RATM was the greatest rock band ever, I loved them. So when i heard of audioslave i though they would be great. But no..it wasnt. Chris Cornell's voice is soo annoying. I knew that no one could compare to Zach, his voice and tom's guitar were the best. But the ne guy's voice makes Tom Morello's guitaring sound terrible.....Just terrible. But still 1 star cuz it's good if u block out the singing..."
1,WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED???,"I love RATM,when they split i was rolling around on the floor crying,well nearly.Then i hear that there starting a new band but minus zack so i thought oh well zack was good lets see how they sound now with a new singer,so there i was eager to hear the 1st track.........then bang,what the (insert profanity here)was this(insert profanity here again)????Cornell sounds like he's been smoking 100 ciggarettes a day for the past 20 years and the lyrics?well put it this was,zack was one of the most intelligent lyricists out there next to maynard kennan and billy corgan,and cornell clearly doesnt even come close.STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD and go listen to a cat getting strangled or something,trust me it's better."
3,It's Good!!!,First off I hear that this band has like all the members of Rage Against the Machine except for the singer...so I thought hey let's check it out it might be good.So I get it and I listen to it and I think it's ok...it is definitely not RATM....I think Rage was better....that's just me though!!!I like the Cochise song...that is a good song....I wouldn't recommend this CD to any RATM fans because it's not the same except for the guitarist....who is really good.P.S. I am sry that I don't know the names of the people in the bands but I am starting to learn as I go...Peace out folks!!!...
2,no surprises,"I bought this CD on the strength of the Cochise single. I thought the powerful guitar and great singing would lead to a great album. As it turns out, the singing is without any real surprises, nothing very melodic or musically interesting. No twists, no turns.The guitaring is powerful, but also dull. A few cool tricks here and there, mostly in the 'cool noises' category, but nothing to make me perk up and listen carefully.Also, I found the dynamics were flat and boring. Since I wrote this originally, the music has grown on me (well 2 songs have)."
4,Awesome Stuff!,"Take a piece of Soundgarden (a premier band of the early '90's) and combine it with pieces of arguably the most politcal band of the late twentieth century (Rage against the Machine), and what comes out is something fresh and unique! Audioslave provides all the sounds of modern rock'n roll, with excellent, versitalle vocals, and even some hints of classic rock. Don't miss tracks 1, Cochise, and 8, I am the Highway, the best two on the album. Enough talk, though. Pick this one up and experience it for yourself."
3,Predictable,What do you get when you mix Rage Against The Machine with Soundgarden? AUDIOSLAVE! That is exactly it- this is a solid effort but doesn't have any surprises. It is RAM with Chris Cornell vocals and no rap. The disc is a little too mellow for Cornell's voice at times and it seems that 75% of the songs follow the same format of: Kick[en]opening guitar riff - mellow music during the verse - Kick[en] guitar riff w/ chorus - mellow verse - etc. etc.The Rubin production is impeccable but I don't think he pushed hard enough to get the best out of these guys. Tom Morello's guitar tone is super cool and sounds clean but he doesn't do anything much diff. than he did with RAM.Cornell's voice is great as always but he should have done more screaming and sounds his best on the ultra-raspy Cochise.
4,"""Go on and save yourself!""","It's so nice to hear RATM be able to rock -- and I mean ROCK --without being bogged down by the politically inspired messages so prevalent in the Zach de la Rocha years. The new voice the band has welcomed provides something of a rebirth and a cleansing of the messages that, while impactful, frequently got in the way of the band's musical superiority."
4,"Good, maybe classic, but still not as good as Soundgarden or Rage Against the Machine","While I can't argue this is a well-crafted album (maybe one of the best-produced albums of the last 20 years), it feels really...slick. Over-polished. Not at all 'raw'. Audioslave is a great piecing-together of two great bands (Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine), but it feels almost too deliberate. This doesn't make Audioslave's self-titled debut album a bad listen by any means. It just feels overly radio-friendly, and not as subversive as one would like."
4,Slave to Rock,"We've spent 10 years in the shadow of pseudo rock, called grunge/alternative. Finally, some serious heavyweights in the form of Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine (minus Zack) have grabbed the torch.There sound is best captured in tracks such as Set it Off, Gasoline, and Cochise. These are bone crunching tracks with soaring vocals and wailing guitars."
5,Worth getting,"I would give this 4.5 stars. Great music, worth getting. I still perfer the original ""Rage Against the Machine"" and ""Badmotorfinger"", but if you like them you will like this album."
4,Just the Beginning,"As these guys keep playing together they are really going to get a lot better, but thats not to say this album wasn't of high quality, as one reviewer said, I was expecting something purely legendary. The song structure is pretty generic and seems like childs play compared to some of those Soundgarden epics. But, the musicianship is first rate, the lyrics are pretty good and Cornell's voice is of course, divine. The drumming is servicable but nothing really extraordinary. Morello does enough great stuff on the guitar to make this a good listen alone. There is not a single weak song on this album, only a few are mediocre, very good, very listenable album. The Best tracks are: Like A Stone, Shadow of the Sun, Last Remaining Light, I am the Highway and Cochise."
3,Rock out!!,"It's like the old Rage Againts the Machine, Soundgarden and Chili Peppers rolled into one. Nice album. You can bang your head till your nose bleeds or you can cry along with this album. This is a very good thing."
2,"Buy It For ""Like A Stone""","This fusion of Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine is much more of a win for Soundgarden fans than Rage fans. You will not find any of the hip-hop influences or rich grooves often found on a Rage CD. That said, this is not that great of a CD. It is almost painful to listen to it from start to finish. The first 5 tracks are tolerable with the best tracks as bookends. ""Cochise"" starts the CD off strong, but sadly the CD cannot maintain the momentum. The opener is followed by 3 run-of-the-mill tracks that can be listened to, but quickly forgotten. The legacy of this band will certainly be ""Like A Stone"". This track is worth the price of admission. Chris Cornell works the catchy lyrics much like he did on ""Blackhole Sun"".If you buy the CD, you will probably find yourself listening to ""Cochise"", skipping to ""Like A Stone"", and repeating. The other tracks are either uninteresting or plain aweful."
2,just average hard rock,"It's always good to see Chris performing,but this project is a big retrocess in his career. I thought that with Euphoria he was making some progress...but he has returned to his roots,just rock.Buy this if you wanna headbang a little, or ""amaze at the great lyrics""...I reccomend you go get Ultramega OK."
2,BORING!,"I only like 4 songs on this cd......""Cochise"" is OK, ""Like a Stone"" is about the best one, ""I am the Highway"" is ok, and ""Show me how to live"" is good......the rest of the songs drag on and are BORING. I can't get thru the whole cd without skipping thru to get to these 4 songs I like."
2,I took a chance,"Wow, how much do I not like this album--lets just say I'm still trying to work my way up to a second listen. The only songs I really like are the ones I'd heard before I bought the album. I could have just played them on YouTube and been happy. There are only five good songs on the whole thing, in my book that's not good enough. I found myself getting irritated little over halfway through. What is going on here? I thought I found a sure bet and all I found was regret."
5,one of my absolute favorite cds,"this cd rules.i love chris cornell's voice and the raw crazy guitar.best songs-Show Me How To Live,Set It Off,Like A Stone,Exploder,Shadow on the Sun.Song by song rating-1.Cochise-great song,good opening.5/52.Show Me How To Live-""you gave me a life now show me how to live...""great lyrics.a fav.5/53.Gasoline-good.not a fav but awesome.5/54.What You Are-really good.5/55.Like A Stone-a single[read:hit] and a great choice for one.great guitar stuff.5/56.Set It Off-Quite possibly my favorite on the album.great lyrics and vocals.5/57.Shadow on the Sun-still awesome.5/58.I Am The Highway-good but slower.4/59.Exploder-love this song.5/510.Hypnotize-really awesome.5/511 thru 14-great songs too.4/5 to 5/5 rating on those.BUY THIS CD! ITS SO WORTH IT! ITS ALWAYS IN MY CD PLAYER[when green day and nirvana,etc aren't]its awesome all together"
4,I loved this CD,I thought this CD was awesome!!! Not one of the ones I couldn't stop listening to (that's why I gave it 4 stars) but a good CD anyway. I liked the thought out lyrics and the great guitar parts. I liked the up beat tempo of the music. I highly recommend this CD to any rock fan. On the other hand I do think the second CD will be better.
3,"Not Soundgarden nor RATM, more like the little brother.","The Soundgarden meets RATM band is just like that, unfortunately. The guitar riffs follow the style of RATM but a little more...mmm, yeah, let's say it: commercial and softer. I loved Soundgarden's music and lyrics, and one could hardly listen to this band not remembering RATM or Soundgarden, it's the risk you take when doing such a fusion of people. Anyways, this new line up couldn't produce a solid group of songs for an album. There's some ones here and there but in general, the album doesn't show some authentic Audioslave sound.Bottomline: Audioslave reaches a quality level that's lower than any of it's ""parent"" bands, unfortunately."
2,"Not a Slave to their Audio (Sorry, that's corny)","I was a bit disappointed with this album. After all the fuss ""Like a Stone"" got on MTV and such, I figured the album would be impressive. It's as if they were trying to please everyone. Some songs are angry and cynical, others are mushy and metaphorical. Good bands are able to easily attract people on different levels with one cd, but this was not one of those bands. Of course, ""Like a Stone"" was okay and ""I Am the Highway"" is pretty good, but the rest of the album isn't worth listening to. Go buy some Radiohead instead."
2,not very original,"this isn't nessecarily a terrible album, however the problem for me was that it really didn't break any new ground; these guys are still pulling out the same bone-headed riffs that groups like AC/DC and Black Sabbath did 30 years ago. i heard cochise on the radio before i had heard the rest of the album and i was really excited coz its a really catchy song, however i found the rest of the album was very hear-one song you've heard em all, not including ""i am the highway"" which i think is a shocking ballad. if i want to hear well constructed ballads i'll stick to my ben folds five and coldplay. if you want well-constructed heavy metal/rock listen to tool or rage against the machine, when morello, wilk and tim bob were actually making decent political statements in their music."
3,Great .... if you like Soundgarden,"The only reason I can't give this five stars is because I was never a Soundgarden fan, I'm a Rage fan. And do not be mistaken, they sound like Soundgarden not Rage. But, there are still some good songs so you might think it is worth checking out. I'll wait for Zach De La Rocha's solo album."
5,Superb,I am a huge RATM fan and this album is as good if not better than rage. I was very impressed with the way Cornell sounded with the band. The guitar riffs are top notch. This band will be huge. Can't wait for the tour.
3,Size Chart Wrong,"Do not trust the size chart. I ordered a 3X, which was listed as 26-28. The shirt came stamped with 22-24 on the tag. It will have to be exchanged."
2,I returned them... HUGE LOSS of the older style,"This T-shirt, while still of Danskin's always-wonderful quality (that's why I gave it any stars), is unfortunately not a good replacement for the #3735 tees I used to purchase as my only nightshirts -- I loved the sturdy but lighter, loose and comfy, and very nice, high-quality 100% cotton of that older ""model"" -- the fabric in this t-shirt is considerably heavier, and because it's made with a bit of Spandex, it isn't light or cool -- it is (to me) stretchy and bulky and consequently does not have a nicely flowing shape any longer -- not attractive if one is disguising a little extra ""heft""... I was MOST disappointed to see these changes, and I dearly hope Danskin will consider re-introducing a plain 100% cotton, cooler and lighter, good basic tee-shirt again."
5,Continental Electric White 10 Speed Blender,"I like this product because work very well and I love it. It's easy to clean, I recommend this item."
2,A Remake Which Should Never Have Been Made,"Purely by accident, I ended up with this movie. I was after the original.Anyway, the movie shamelessly pulls scenes from the original 1980's version. The original was scary, this one is . . . stupid. It follows the same storyline, but without the grainly graphics and bad lighting, it just doesn't cut it.Take my advice, buy the original, NOT the remake. (...)"
4,Great Beth Moore study,"You can never go wrong with a Beth Moore study. She has a gift for opening the Word and revealing Truth!I would not buy from this seller, however. It took almost an entire month for it to arrive."
4,refreshed,"I am really enjoying this book. It is a very detailed and systematic way to really dig into the stories of Luke. For me, they are familiar stories and this book digs down beyond the typical topics and addresses things I would never have considered otherwise. It is a refreshing approach to my devotional time, though this book is not necessarily a devotional. The chapters are short enough (a few pages) that it functions well as such for me. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a meticulous walk-through of Luke!"
5,Jesus the One and Only,Thanks so much for the book. It was in good conditon and is so helpful in the Bible Study group I am conducting.
5,study,"i knew i loved beth moore, she has so much insight to share with us. and yet again she is taking me on a fabulous journey with Jesus. there is so much history which brings understanding and make connections. and she is a woman that understands women and our need for God. i am only two weeks into it, but am so glad i am doing this study! it would be a great one to start around Christmas, since the beginning talks about Jesus' birth!"
4,Jesus the One and Only by Beth Moore,"The information provided in the study book is very good reading, especially for women's bible study groups. We currently are using thisfor our church's circle group. We also purchased the study guide. I recommend it to anyone who hasn't read any of Beth Moore's books."
5,Figures and illustrations make this a winner,"This book, and especially the visuals, helped me get through thermodynamics at MIT. Highly recommended as a supplemental text!"
2,The Structure of Materials (MIT Series in MSE),I had an opportunity to use this text book in one of my classes and found the material within the book confusing for the most part. There are NOT many examples worked out following the explanations of complex equations and their applications -- I feel this leads to a rather limited understanding of important concepts. I recommend looking elsewhere for a crystallography book if you have an option.
1,beyond lame,All this is are highlights of the European Cup Finals. That's it. You get none of the earlier rounds nor the buildup of each season's European Cup competition.So many of the Finals are dull shootout or 1-0 wins that this is no way to showcase the best of European soccer.
4,WAs exactly as expected,"This product came exactly as the picture indicates. I bought this for my dad, who had recently purchased a lexus, for Christmas and he loved it!"
5,It is NOT a New James Herriot but there are reasons to purchase it:,"I agree with the first reviewer and in fact wrote something like that myself after buying one of the other Herriot books with the ""new"" title....However, there is ONE good reason to buy this set, that is that they are available in large print which the ""regular"" Herriot books are not. For my elderly mother this is a real plus.I just really wish ither the publisher, or else here on Amazon, that they'd be numbered according to how to read them. I can ""sort of"" tell by the reviews, but not completely."
3,I've played better,"Length:: 1:38 MinsNice finish,but the overtones just don't have the sweetness of depth you want from a steel shell.The old steel shell free floaters have an edgier tone that this one lacks.Video is of Evans Genera dry drum head ,die cast batter hoop and 42 strand snares."
4,Awesome,"This snare drum is simply put an excellent snare drum. I've played on it several times and will be purchasing one soon. It has incredible cutting power, going through any cymbal resonance one could produce. Coupled with a deeper tone due to it's shell height. The cutting power of a piccolo snare that so many of us drummers need, with the tone that so many of us metal guys want.I can't wait to get the cash for this one."
4,Charming and Addictive,"Raising the Bar is one of the best court dramas I've seen in a long time. The writing is terrific, the acting is great, and they do a great job balancing out serious topic with light hearted humor. Some of my favourite scenes stem from the lawyers meeting up at their usual bar after hours. The budding romance between Bobbie and Jerry is also really entertaining because it gives the viewer something to hope for, giving them a reason to tune in next week. The show can get repetitive at times as Trudy's consistant brash unprofessionalism and unapolagetic hatred of Jerry becomes very annoying at times. That said, Raising the Bar is a fine show and an entertaining way to spend an hour."
3,Err ...so so,"Possibly needs another season in order to develop into something? Watchable but somehow just doesnt grab. Perhaps the use of the same judge in almost all of the cases, or the stupidity of the said judge has something to do with it. Not sure if I will be bothered to buy the next season."
2,Short little thing...,"This tripod is short and the ball head is a bit cheesy but mostly metal so if you have strong hands you can get it to clamp pretty tight to hold gear that is off balance or heavier then what the head is rated for. I'm not really a fan of the twist locks but the aluminum seems sturdy enough as long as you are easy on it.I was well aware of the size and quality when I bought it, as it was purchased with the purpose of being able to bicycle tour and take landscape shots with. With these things in mind, unless you are buying it for a small person/child I would skip this one. If you need light weight and don't mind spending only slightly more, Manfrotto makes several options that are taller and will be more versatile."
4,Very nice,I was hunting for one particular piece but the total is far more gratifying. Subperb vocals and nice athmosphere.It's only drawback is that it is too short :-)regardsChris
4,Overplayed,This has to be one of the most overplayed songs of the 1990s. It's the new millenium and it *still* is overplayed. The song is that good.
4,Catchy,"I usually don't like this kind of stupid generic pop music, but this song is ridiculously catchy. Night at the Roxburys was never very funny, though."
5,A review of Water Into Wine,"This is an excellent single, well worth picking up for the non-album B-sides, which are of course excellent songs. Fallen Angel and Hold Me are terrific, and it is a wonder that they did not make the Last Wave Of Summer album."
2,Needs more sticking power,"One big problem with these Porter Cable sanding discs -- they don't stick enough to the pad. Only after pressing very inch of the discs onto the pad firmly that I managed to get the discs to stay on the sander, a PC 333V. The Mirka discs that I bought stick to the pad much better."
2,Nice Ball But Poor Glow,I purchased 12 of these balls for an outdoor glow tournament. They held their glow charge for roughly five minutes. We spent the rest of the night charging and rotating the balls in and out of games. It would have been nice for the manufacturer to share this information on the front side in the product specs. We would have still probably purchased the product and run the tournament but we could have been prepared for this issue instead of scrambling to keep the balls glowing for the tournament.
4,Cool,"I got this awhile ago for my friend. It was mailed to the wrong address and I called Amazon about it. They were really helpful and offered to have it shipped again with no extra charges. Amazon is awesome like that! As for the review about this volleyball, it does it's job. Came in perfect condition. The glowing aspect of it is mediocre. You can't really play this at night because it doesn't glow that much."
3,it does hold the glow for very long.,"Volleyball has been great for recreational use, although it glows in the dark for a bit, it really isn't needed at most courts which have lighting already there.Was a little disappointed the ball did not hold the glow for very long. Other wise the kids loved the ball."
4,Decent quality,"I am not a competitive volleyball player, and this ball was used only for recreational purposes. Ball came fast, good seller, although after a few uses noticed a little stretching on one of the seams. Had to get some sewing string and re thread the holes since it was the threads between the seams that was coming undone. Over all, its a good ball and decently priced for the quality. Would like to see how the rest of it holds up now."
2,Mikasa VSG Glow in the Dark Volleyball,This is the second volleyball because the first one started to leak at the seams in less than 2 weeks. Another think I don't like about the ball is that it glows for only 5 minutes. I was expecting it to glow at least 30 minutes so the 5 minutes is well under my expectations. The return procedures went flawlessly.
4,Glow in the Dark Volleyball,"If it gets a lot of light before you need to use it then it will glow well for about 15 minutes. We could still see where it was in the room for about 20 minutes, and then needed to expose it to light again. We had fun playing with it. For the price it was worth it."
3,Mikasa glow volleyball,"Although the texture and quality of the volleyball is great, I find that the ""glow"" doesn't last very long. I feel a yard light would be a better option. On the good side, for the short time it worked, the ""glowing"" was a fun thing."
1,broken already,We purchased this tetherball and after one or two uses by my 8 year old daughter - and it is broken already! I am going to call or write in today to exchange!
1,Disappointed,Received the video in a timely manner. Video quality was poor. Images were grainy and copy didn't run well though all other vhs tapes run fine on my video player. This was intended for use in my german language class but I am not sure I will use it.
1,The author should have her Ph.D. revoked.,"Awful. Embarrassing. The Subject Area Review is poorly written, contains contradictions, leaves out incredibly important details, and, in some places, is simply inaccurate. It is also egregiously inconsistent in the way it presents information.CliffsTestPrep needs to find a Historian who possesses both the substantive knowledge and the ability to present it in a consistent and effective manner.Shana Pate (Ph.D.?!!!!) needs to find another career."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This is one of the WORST sources of test preparation I have ever seen. The questions in no way resemble the actual test, in terms of higher order thinking, or organization. A sharp stick in the eye would be a better way to prepare yourself for this exam then buying this book"
1,Horribly inept,"I used this book to study for my recent Praxis examination. The format is friendly, with review information first, practice tests second. However, there are innumerable problems in the practice test--the question mentioned in the other review about McCarthyism is one of the many eyebrow raising-questions--that are not limited to typos or grammatical errors. The content reviewed leaves out an extraordinary amount of information. I just took the test yesterday and there were at least twenty questions on the Praxis itself that concern topics which the CliffsTest didn't even mention, much less provide background information. Even the practice tests that Cliffs itself provides ask about information that is not present in the first half of the text.A complete and utter waste of time--I would recommend using several more detailed books about each area of content on the Praxis instead of this text."
1,Wow....are you serious?,"As a recent college graduate working towards a teaching certificate, i got this book to help me study for the Praxis test(s). But honestly, who did they get to edit this book?, a mentally challenged monkey? An ESL student? Seriously?! Im a history person, and not all that great when it comes to picking up on gramatical errors, but i found at least a dozen! Including skipping an entire number on the answer sheet (106, 107, 109...108 anyone??) for test number 1. While the content seemed okay, the grammer and some rather ambigious questions really makes me doubt this book's creditability. Dont buy it!"
1,Terrable Study guide,i used this bookt o study for teh Praxis 2 social studies content knowledge. none of the questiosn on teh text came from this book. In fcat this book really did not cover anything that was asked on the actual test. Save yoruself some money and time and dont buy this book. It was a waist of time and engery on my part to use this book as a study guide.
3,"When I took the test, I thought it wasn't helpful enough....","But then I got my scores. I got a 170 on Content Knowledge and 169 on Interpretation of Materials. After the test, I was sure I had failed. So was this book helpful? I guess yes and no. I studied what it told me to study, and I did the practice tests in the back. Not very much of what was in the book was on my test, but it must be somewhat helpful for me to get that score.I would buy it, but realize that the test is incredibly hard and no book will completely prepare you. As for this book specifically, there were typos and confusing questions but all in all a good jumping off point."
3,Not good for the GACE,"I purchased this book because I thought it would help me with the GACE Middle Grades - Social Science exam. They don't make GACE review books yet and I thought this would be close enough. This book gives a very general review of social studies, which makes it inappropriate for the GACE. The GACE, even for Middle Grades, asked for very specific information and it was a lot more difficult than the Praxis practice exams in the book. I have no idea how well it is for preperation for the PRAXIS, but it's not good for preparation for the GACE."
4,Just What the Doctor Ordered,I ordered the cliff notes to study for my upcoming Praxis II in History and Social Studies. Since I have yet to take the test I can only give you my impressions. The book seems to be a good and concise review for the exam. I have answered enough practice Praxis questions to think I could probably walk in today and pass the test but it is nice to know that I will be covering all the bases and reviewing thoroughly for the exam.
3,good outline & practice test,"This book gives an accurate outline of the scope of the material in the test. It is not a book that you would review from, but it would be a good source to start from."
1,Not Helpful,"This study guide is not very useful for the Praxis II exam. The book is not organized like the exam what so ever. I would stick with purchasing the Praxis guide books or Kaplan, insist of this one."
1,Praxis II Social Studies review,"The whole book is very subjective, doesn't follow the guidelines for what to study as presented by Praxis, and ultimately is a poor preparation tool for the test."
3,Dissapointed,"The review for the material is not adequate, but the practice exams are helpful thanks to the explanations of the answers."
3,Not the best study tool,"This book lists information chronologically in lists. There isn't much detail about specific time periods and the way everything is organized, it's really hard to learn the information."
1,Do Not Purchase,"This book is filled with spelling errors, grammatical errors, and wrong answers in the test section. They even have some questions left out of the answer sheet, which completely diminishes all credibility for a test review source, but even more so when the source is meant to help with a licensure test."
2,Too many errors,"The practice test key and explanation sections contain too many errors for a book of this length, especially given that it's a study guide. In a few cases the wrong answer is listed in the key but the correct answer with the explanation, and in other cases the explanation and the answer do not match. These are not difficult errors to fix on the part pf the editing/revision process before publication, but the errors do cause confusion, annoyance, and some additional anxiety when under pressure to prepare for an exam such as this. There are also several typos/writing errors that erode confidence in this as a reliable guide. Unfortunately, however, there are few study guides/practice tests out there, so this is the best there is at the moment."
2,"Shoddy, Incomplete, Many Errors","The info provided is okay. The tests are poorly constructed and full of questions that either don't make sense, or are not similar to the questions on the Praxis (I just took it). After taking these practice tests I was really worried, because even after reading the minimal explanations of answers, some did not make sense to me. Stick to the ETS-produced book. It's true to the test."
3,All the help you can get,"When preparing for the Praxis II in Social Studies,you will feel intimidated and rightfully so. A lot of material is included on the test and depending on the formulation of the questions, you may be unable to answer the specific question (while maintaining a good understanding of the subject). I preferred this text over the ""official"" praxis book. It is helpful in familiarizing the student with the subjects. However, neither can prepare the student for the obsure question that depends on one's mastery of historical trivia. This book will help reveal your areas of scholastic weakness. However, this book will not give you the answers you need, just the motivation to go find these answers. Buy this book early as a tool to direct you the areas of study you most need."
2,"A waste, but you got to start somewhere...","I bought this book thinking it was going to be a good review of all the topics, and as mentioned by other posters, it's full of typos and is not very thorough. While no book can adequately review all the content included in the Praxis, this one leaves out basics that should have been covered. However, it is good for a couple reasons... it has two practice tests. The practice tests seem to have the most typos. The best way I've found to study for these tests is to use a combination of things- old textbooks/lecture notes from college, cliffs notes of each individual section (econ, US history, etc.) and the actual prep book from ETS (which also had it's problems). Long story short... buy this book knowing it is extremely basic and incomplete, be aware of typos/mistakes, & practice using the tests in the back."
3,Good general suggestions most are common sense.,"I purchased this book after receiving a ticket and deciding to fight it in court. I was looking for some information about RADAR and court room procedures. The book has good general suggestions and is informative in that regard. As far as court room procedure and how to subpeona information and rules of discovery it has none. I don't have time to go to Law School before my court date so I need some quick information on the how to's. This book is short on those. If you need to know how to act in front of a cop that just stopped you, buy this book. If you need to know how to actually fight your ticket, subpeona evidence, create your defense and win in court check out the other suggestions."
2,A SO-SO Book.,"This book is not too bad. It is full of great tips and tactics. But alot of it is common sense. If you really want to beat a speeding ticket and want to learn all about the equipment the police use to nail you, I suggest you buy the book called The Educated Guide to Speeding Tickets by Richard Wallace. He is an ex cop and who knows more about radar, speeding tickets than a cop. He has written a great book. His book helped me beat 2 speeding tickets so far. You can buy it right here at Amazon."
3,buy this before the ticket.,"interesting book, but more of a prevention. It doesn't do much good after you've gotten the ticket."
3,Good but not Great,"The book is good, basically gave advice on different areas and what to say and not to say when stopped by the cops, some excuses to give so you might not get issued a ticket, apart from that, i really didn't see logical ways that i can hold on to win a traffic case in court rather than the book talking about procedures in court which one already knows if you've been to any traffic court."
4,Great book with useful advise,"This book is written clearly and helps you know your rights and it tells you how to say things in a case. Yes there are a lot of things in the book that are common sense but most things no one would ever think of, especially how to word your sentences."
5,ACE OF BASE: SWEDISH POP FOR BEACHCOMBERS,"ACE OF BASE; SWEDISH POP FOR BEACHCOMBERS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I Sverge (Sweden), many of the inhabitants flee the winter dark for warmer climes where they can dance on the beach and play maypole.Buy this CD, ""All That She Wants,"" for happy music and fond memories of beach resorts around the world.The two lead singers are as desirable as Fuller proffering a single malt whiskey, intoning, ""They're GORGEOUS!""--John M. Edwards"
3,Bought for RPG use,"This is a blister pack of cast metal parts. The broken hand cart must be super glued together and has very little in the way of reference tabs in which to place the parts properly. In addition, the parts are quite small and care must be used. In my experience, glue accelerator should also be used. I purchased this for use in RPGs and plan on creating reconfigurable terrain with it, obviously a pile a junk. It is a little small for my 25mm scale, but usable."
5,One of the best cd i have ever heard,"This cd is just amazing, i don't know how the songs didn't went hits to charts and least videos. Jennifer Paige is a great artist and i have read that she is about to release a new album later this year, maybe on 2006. I would love to have this cd in my hands, it will worth the wait. Check on [...] for the last demos and information. This is a must buy for good music listeners."
5,Awesome!!!,"Jennifer Paige's new CD electrifies you!!! Her music as well as her voice is strong and easy to listen to. Her first CD was fabulous but this one sure tops the first. The first song on the CD ""These Days"" is an exceptional example of what Jennifer is capable of. I highly suggest this CD to anyone who is looking for some great music!!!!"
2,understand the meaning of the word 'cover',"just because you haven't heard a song sung before, does NOT make the song an original. they are still cover songs- she didn't write them and she didn't record them first. i really liked some of the song's catchiness but i'm very disappointed that jennifer paige would randomly cover 2 songs from plumb- making it seem like they were her own songs- and then sing them just like plumb sang them- without any real change/improvement in melody, tempo, etc. they ARE great songs but listen to the real thing- buy plumb's album."
2,cover band?,"The first three tracks are covers! And not even very good covers! I have nothing against doing an occasional cover, but if you wanna open your album with three of them, they'd better be stunningly innovative or fresh... these weren't. Bardot's ""Make Me"" was more fun, and Plumb's ""Here With Me"" and ""Stranded"" were better too. Blah. Paige isn't bad musically, but she could've been a little more original... oh well."
2,Nothing new here...,"Sorry folks, for those of you who were hoping that Jennifer would release some new material worthy of the immense talent she showed potential for from her previous cd, you won't find it on this one. I bought this cd hoping for the best, but found it sitting unspun on my cd rack collecting dust a few days after I bought it. There is just nothing worth while to listen to on this disk, and I was really disappointed to here her cover version of the Tiffany Lee penned song ""Here With Me"" from the group Plumb. Don't waste your money on this unless you are looking for some uninspired pop or if you have some cash to burn and don't mind getting it as a filler to take space up on your wall after a couple of days. Sorry folks... but that's my two cents."
1,unimaginative,"Her voice is okay but she doesn't have a strong, dedicated band and I was disappointed to see that she isn't writing much of her own stuff. Stranded and Here With Me were written by Tiffany Arbuckle whose band, Plumb, is much stronger than Jennifer's backup. Obviously this is just a case of a record company like Universal trying to push a pretty face and a decent voice to sell records, which is really a shame considering Plumb deserves more attention than they ever got."
2,"Sad, sad, SAD!!","Jennifer Paige's voice is just as beautiful as her face. What a talent!! I remember seeing her perform the song ""Crush"" on the Today show, and I immediately bought the CD. What I loved about her was the fact that with the kind of talent and integrity she was displaying, there was NO WAY she was going to be heard on the radio. She seemed unwilling to sell out just to be popular. Well, after listening to this CD, obviously somewhere along the way she decided to sell out. Fortunately she hasn't sunk to the level of going around scantily clad and falling down drunk in public (thank God). This CD is so heavily studio-manufactured that it really doesn't even matter who's singing. It's a real shame, I'd love to see JP come out with a new CD, but for now, if you want to hear her purely beautiful voice, you'll have to stick with her first (self-titled) CD.BTW...Jennifer sang a song on the Disney movie ""The Country Bears"" called ""Kick It In Gear"" and she ROCKED an otherwise worthless movie!!!"
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD. It takes a little while to get used to it. The songwriting is not too schmaltzy. The beat songs are: Feel So Far Away, The Edge, and Tell Me When. The songs have great beats. And she has a great voice!"
2,Not the same product in the picture,"I bought this product expecting to get a bottle of 120 capsules, which was shown in the picture, but ended up with the 60 capsule bottle at the same price. The only reason I even bought this product was because the product picture showed the 120 capsule version.It's a great product, I just don't appreciate being ripped off."
5,an eye opener!,"I have been donating to the Fund for Animals for quite some time but had never read/heard the story of how it came about. Cleveland tells a fascinating story of what was behind his vision of creating the Black Beauty Ranch. The unbelievable cruelness of people is hard to deal with -- but here is an individual who had actively fought it and created a peaceful home to so many abused, neglected animals of all kinds. I found it thoroughly enjoyable and it made me want to donate more."
4,Ranch of Dreams,"This is a very interesting book and very informative about animal issues. I learned a lot. However, I'm not fond of Cleveland Amory's writing style--too many parenthetical phrases for me."
4,Keith Green 'Ultimate Collection',"DVD version adds a nice perspective to an already unique contribution of talent in serving The LORD. The music alone is from a different time, where 'folk' influenced several levels of music; country, popular, gospel, etc.... Keith Greene excelled from this type of background, but granted today the 'ear' for 'folk' oreinted music has lost its ability to appreciate that particular era. This may account for a certain Gap which can be noticed when listening to the Keith Greene sound today."
5,Keith Green's music always speaks God to me,"If you're looking to understand God better, listen to Keith's music. Twenty five years after his transfer to heaven, his music still speaks God's word to humanity. With humor and sincerity, Keith ministers with song and instrument that exhibits a strength of will and heart for God that is unsurpassed."
5,Love it,"Sure brings back memories. Am glad I can listen to this in the car - all I had were cassette tapes which, of course, are old, old, old."
5,The Best of Its Kind,"I first heard Alessandro Safina's ""Only You"" while watching the Brazilian telenovela O Clone, in which the song served as one of the principle love themes. I and a friend from Germany were blown away by the song. He downloaded just that song, I bought the CD and don't regret it for a second.Safina is FAR SUPERIOR to Andrea Bochelli and Josh Groban. His voice demonstrates the fact that he has formally studied classical voice since childhood. He would be more truthfully and successfully compared with opera singers like Domingo, Pavarotti, and Carreras.I love the inherent darkness in his tenor--it blows me away everytime I listen to his songs. I'm looking forward to purchasing future works by Alessandro Safina. My one disappointment is that PR for Safina doesn't seem to exist in this country."
3,Nice voice-intersting pop/classical tunes,"I bought upon the suggestion of Amazon. If you are an Andrea Bocelli fan,I think he lacks the emotion filled voice of Andrea. I noticed that 90% of the songs were written by the same guy. But Amazon was correct-if you like Andrea you will like A.S. The first track is wonderful and seems destined to be a single. This guy DOES have a great voice and I will certainly give it fair share of rotation on the cd player. His music is very sweet and romantic. AND to my happiness the English translation is in the cover!!!!"
3,BEST VOICE - but I can't hear his spirit!,"I feel exactly the way another reviewer does: THe voice is beyond outstanding - it's amazingly beautiful, and the songs are beautiful,too........ but I can't hear the depth of emotion and spirituality that I hear in Andrea Bocelli, Sarah Brightman, and Fernando Lima. He does not seem to feel fully what he is singing. He just goes through the motion.May be his new albums are different???!!!!!"
4,Infinitely better than Russell Watson,"I do think that Safina is infintely better than Russell Watson, as Safina has a better and stronger voice and a much more secure singing technique. He looks even more imposing on the stage. He, instead of RUssell Watson, is the real singer of our times!"
3,He's ok...,"Generally clear and melodic voice, but it sometimes gets a bit thick in the lower ranges, while he strains on the higher notes and occasionally goes a bit sharp. I completely disagree that he sounds anything like Bocelli; his voice is definitely not of that caliber. The songs had good variety, but he lacks the color, or perhaps emotional quality of a Bocelli or even Josh Groban to bring them to life."
2,Overproduced,"Safina does indeed have a beautiful voice. I would like to hear him actually sing a song or an aria, but on this album all we get is heavily orchestrated production numbers starting with a few simple lines and building to throbbing, bellowing conclusions. Mario Frangoulis brings off this kind of album with more variety and finesse. Hopefully Safina's other discs are more varied and restrainied."
1,No taste,"Hibidee Shibbitz has no taste. Many people like opera. It is much better than the insipid pop, hip-hop, and R&B music available on the market today. He should go back to which ever hell hole (New Jersey) he came from.There are no opera tracks on this CD. Hibidee is very mistaken."
1,Harsh,"this may possibly be the worst piece of music i've ever come across. Why anyone would think to combine techno with opera is totally beyond me. nobody likes opera. nobody likes techno. it stands to reason that the fusion of the two would be an abomination. this is an insult to the public's taste. ridiculous, completely ridiculous."
2,Not of this earth- Again??,"I have seen both remakes of Roger Corman's Not of this Earth, and I must say his 1957 version with Paul Birch and Beverly Garland was better! I'm truly not a supporter of remakes, because they never capture in my opinion, the original director or author's ""touch of class."" I also don't understand why they haven't released Mr. Corman's 1957 version? Two remakes, but not the original on VHS? I think somebody has it backwards. Besides, Mr. Birch and Miss Garland have my vote any time."
3,Traci Lords isn't in this movie...,"A slight correction: Traci Lords appeared in the 1988 remake of ""Not of this Earth,"" not the 1995 remake (i.e., she's not in the film that's for sale on this page)."
1,too much static!,"I have the model without the answering machine. It is by far the worst cordless I have ever used (let alone owned). It is constant static. And switching bands or channels doesn't help. I called Bell South and they stated it was probably the house I was living in. Well, I have since moved and still the same problem. It truly takes away the convenience of a cordless phone. The person on the other side of the line doesn't hear the static. So you are alone in this misery."
5,Great album!!,"What could be better than an album filled with magnetic voice, enchanting melodies, and soulful lyrics? I'd say this is a must- buy! =)"
1,If it sounds to good to be true...it is too good to be true.,I received this portable TV last Friday.ConsNo receptionNo pictureNo soundNo viewing in any part of Los Angeles from Santa Barbara to Long Beach. Other manufacturers portable TV's work great but Axion's doens't.ProsMakes a great paper wait(sp?) (I would look up how to spell wait but this product doesn't deserve that much of anybody's time) and door stop to remind you how much money you wasted on the Axion product.Maybe all Axion products are this bad.Let's hope they refund everyone's money and make a version that get this...works!
3,Bought this in 2006...my Dad still uses his little radio,"I bought this for my Dad who loved to listen to the radio in the bathroom, on the balcony, at the table... you name it. He doesn't use the tv anymore (he says it's so small it's not worth straining his eyes), but 6 yrs later the radio still works (crackles a bit but works) fine. I'd say that's pretty good value."
4,Axiom 2.5 Portable TV,"It works fine. The picture isn't as clear as other more expensive models, but I only paid $25 for it, so for the cost it's great."
3,Primarily for fans of this band,"Medium Rare is an interesting compilation of tracks that primarily interest people who are already fans of the band. Fans will recognize many of the tunes from their earlier CDs. What you get here are demos, B sides, live cuts and other curiosities. Some of them are pretty good. ""Old and Wise,"" the last track, covers an Alan Parsons tune. Gary Chandler's guitar solo stands in for the saxophone on it."
5,"Sweet, Fun, Kids had a Blast!","This set of games is simply sweet, and loads of fun for the kids. Very clever theme and heart-felt lessons interspersed throughout the games. I am telling you, you can feel the love that went into developing this game!"
2,Way too short,"I agree with everything the other reviewers have said about this game's good points, but it has one HUGE issue... this game is REALLY short. My 4-year-old son finished it in less than an hour on Christmas Day. That's it? He enjoyed it enough to play it over again several times, but I felt cheated. The pictures you see on the box are pretty much the entire game. I think there are less than 20 areas, some of which only take a couple of minutes to get through. As good as the game is, it hardly seems worth the money. I suggest going to the Big Idea website for some FREE Veggie Tales games instead. My son still spends more time on that website than on this game."
3,XP or 2000 watch out,"I have had great difficulty getting this game to run well on win2k or xp...tried on several computers. Often get crashing on the intro scenes. Of course it was fine on 98, but after I upgraded things became difficult."
3,gift for someone else,"This film was a Christmas gift for my brother. I appreciate that amazon had a film that was made so long ago. It arrived in a timely fashion and he enjoyed it. Even though they have a large screen HD TV and this was made before HD, it was clear and enjoyable."
5,very suspenseful!,"Very Suspenseful and quite the cliffhanger, making it a bit stressful to watch. Good scenery and good story."
3,Mountain climbing is not easy,This movie is excellent for its climbing sequences and for its realism-a true life story of heroism. I feel sure that I will view this purchase many times and share it with family and friends like a friend showed it to me years ago.
3,A good climbing movie but a poor DVD release,"I have this movie in VHS format. I was waiting for a DVD release in WIDESCREEN. The movie was shot on location in British Columbia and Pakistan. Mountain scenery is beautiful and climbing sequences breathtaking. Music is great. While not without flaws of its own, the movie captures the excitement, beauty, and tragedy of mountain climbing. It is much wiser than recent releases such as ""Vertical Limit"". When the movie is formated to fit the screen 30% of the picture gets [cut]. I am waiting for a widescreen release."
2,"Bland story, great scenery","K-2 is a story about a mountain that doesn't want to be climbed and two men who happen to climb it. However, it fails to generate a fresh angle, simply retreading over familiar turf that other mountain movies have done before (and, unfortunately, have done better).Is it a competent movie? Yes it is. Does it have nice scenery? Yes, it does. Yet it has a ""Been there, done that"" feel to it that it just can't shake. K2 is a pretty movie, but it's also pretty shallow as well."
2,The quality is really bad,The story is ok but the quality of the DVD is really bad. Don't waste money for the DVD version
4,One of My Favorites,"The plot is a bit predictable, yet still suspenseful. Matt Craven (H) shows his fine talents as an actor. Since this file, he has been in other movies and TV series, but when he finally gets ""the role"" he will be recognized for his great talent and range as an actor. At times the photography and scenery are breathtaking on LaserDisc. I am waiting for the DVD release."
1,Poor quality video.,"I loved this movie and have purchased this product. The quality of video was not good and the audio was not synced to the video, making this product worthless in my opinion, i will have to buy from another vendor."
4,Good Movie,"I think this is a great movie and have no idea why it is so hard to find. I guess maybe it didn't do too well at the box office or something. They obviously aren't going to make a wide-screen version of this movie either which takes a lot away from the awesome scenery. I started watching it by accident on one of the movie channels and couldn't stop! I had a very hard time finding this on DVD for some reason. If you like documentaries about climbing Everest and stuff, it's fun to watch Hollywood's twist on it. And it is a big twist. But fun to watch. Hopefully the 4 x 3 screen size won't bother you."
3,K2 - Imported,"If you like this movie get the Blu-ray version. The picture and sound is not good, not a wide screen version. However, I enjoyed the extra movie scenes, and with this extra footage most of the original sound track was changed."
3,"GREAT FILM, POOR DVD","This is a different version to the European one i own on video, it has 6 mins of extra scenes and a very different music score which is not as good as the more orchestral soundtrack on the UK Edition(so im keeping my video copy), still a great film but no real extras and no widescreen transfer, the DVD has not been released in the UK yet so hurry up with an extras loaded widescreen release with all the scenes added. (there are scenes missing from the US release that the UK one has!). PLEASE do this film the justice it deserves next time."
2,K2,The DVD is too much holliwood style and very little documentary. I wonder if the scenes are from the K2 itself. I was disppointed as i expected the rela thing
3,Took way too long to receive,"I chose this vendor since they had the most reviews/transactions. The only complaints I saw were about slow delivery. I took my chances and placed the order on 7/6/10. I was ordering this movie for a birthday gift for 7/18/10. I paid extra for expedited delivery. The estimated delivery dates were 7/12/10-7/19/10. By 7/27/10 I contacted the vendor to ask for the status of delivery. They said they would check into it. When they got back to me they simply asked if I wanted a replacement or a credit - No explanation as to whether the order never shipped or if it was lost in transit. I asked for a replacement and finally received my order on 8/7/10. Yes, I finally received my purchase after 30 days but with no explanation as to what happened to my initial order. I would be hesitant about ordering from this vendor again."
2,"Great scenery, BAD plot and EVEN WORSE characters...","The scenery was great, but character development was non-existent. I really didn't care about any of the characters, because I didn't feel like I knew them! Many technical errors, too, I think, on the climbing end. I'm no expert, but who would climb an 8000 meter peak without a team doctor or a Gamov bag? The scenery, however, was pretty amazing...it's definitely a nice movie to look at!"
1,This movie had me Climbing to Hell,"Aw man...This movie made me want to climb inside a volcano. This movie is about to boring characters, (one who is an uptight snoozer, and the other a typical party boy) who argue about climbing a lousy mountain for half of the duration of the film. There are some useless and boring conflicts about one guy's wife not wanting him to go, and the other guy is a loser and has nothing better to do.If the ending was anything fun to talk about I would love to spoil the ending for you, but I found myself hoping they both die a horrible death up on the mountain. As a matter of fact,I was hoping I would die because the movie really is that terrible."
1,Great Dissapointment,"I thought I could trust ehx for anything but apparently I was wrong. The first thing you notice when you turn nanoclone on is the drop in volume and loud hissing voice. It is unacceptable for this even to be released to be sold. Awful. If you don't want a loud hissssssss and loss in sound quality, do not buy this pedal."
1,Crap...,"Doesn't work well with daisy chains, and once you plugged it, all other pedals won't work!! [...]"
1,horrible and dishonest,"the description of the book said little writing, but really the book had more then half the pages missing and for the amount the book was priced it wasnt worth my money and i got played. i ended up buying another book for the same price. so thanks for making me behind in class and spending more money then i had to"
2,Not very scary,"I am a Michael York fan and so decided to try out this movie. Michael York and to be honest the other actors did a commendable job. But the story/script was just very weak, no scary parts to speak of. Pretty much a waste of time to watch it at all. If I made lists on worst attempts at a ghost story this would be on it"
1,Great Looking - Falls Apart,"I LOVED this watch. I paid $99 for it. It looks great on my smaller wrist. Really a great looking sports watch. BUT, after one week, the second hand completely fell off and was dangling around in the face of the watch. Four days after that, the hour hand fell off. I am not hard on watches. I don't work out much and I never took it in the water or hit it on anything. I thought it was probably just a fluke - a one-time defective watch. So, I ordered a second one, returning the first. It did the exact same thing after about 4 days. So disappointing! Unfortunately, now I'm afraid to order a 3rd watch or to even purchase any other Momentum brand watch ever again. I really loved this watch and haven't found another I like as well (as far as looks go)."
2,Same problem,"I have had this watch about 2 years, but I had the same problem with the second hand falling off. The watch doesn't work now because the second hand jams up the other hands."
1,"CROWN FELL OFF, INTERIOR FOGGED UP","The first time I wore this watch in water (swimming in the Atlantic ocean), the interior was all fogged up; after about 3 months this went away. Then the crown (little stem where you change the time or date) fell off and I have no idea how to get it replaced. These are pieces of junk."
3,Should be called RPG for the Java Programmer,"If you have RPG III or RPG/400 code or this same code that was converted to RPG IV, then this book gives you little to go on but an education in ILE programming techniques. I think that if you were a C or Java programmer trying to understand RPG IV, this book would probably be very helpful.My impression is that RPG IV should have been called RPG-C. That would have been closer to what it seems it was intended for, RPG to attract C programmers. I think that if one had their applications designed and written in ILE RPG with service programs and proceedures, etc. then this book would be helpful in learning the java language.If your programs are designed around RPG III, converted or not to RPG IV, plan on having to learn two languages as you attempt to understand Java."
3,Interesting but Limited Range of Rceipes,"I found the old english recipes charming, especially the 2 written as poems, but as a working cookbook many of the recipies were similar and there were not many I would want to try. Perhaps someone with tastes running to meat entrees would find this more useful as a cookbook."
5,Pleyn Delit has been a hit with adults and teenagers.,"Pleyn Delit offers a great variety of simple to medium hard recipes that can be adapted to your current menu or replace it if the ambition is there. The recipes are tasty and well-explained. Some ingredients are hard to find but for the most part replacement items are named. With this book, I've concocted complete medieval meals as well as odds and ends for special occasions while increasing the depth of my family's usual menus."
4,A Delight,"Pleyn Delit is not only for food scholars and historical interpreters and hobbiests, it is for the laymen of the kitchen. There are recipes in this book that would please the modern palette. Mounchelet is a wonderful stew that normally calls for veal, however I use a regular beef and everyone I serve it to loves it. I leave out the egg thickener and the vinegar.It is an easy introduction and recommended for anyone who wishes to try something different.Try ravioli in a chicken stock.Food for the soul and the mind."
4,Buddy Miles Blules Berries,"I didn't realize I liked the ""Blues"" until I listened to Blues Berries. Buddy Miles hasn't missed a beat since ""Them Changes."" For all Buddy Miles fans, this is a ""Must listen."""
3,not as good as season one and two,"has several good episodes including the puppet master and the christmas and halloween episodes. unlike season one and two, quite a few episodes in season three are simply not funny at all. still in all i am looking forward to season four being released."
3,Disenchanted,"When this series was on TV, I loved it but somehow owning it has taken the something away. The jokes did not quite crack me up as they use to. Maybe it is me but owning the package has turned me off buying TV series, maybe it is because I over saturate myself with the episodes. This holds true for another TV series I purchased, therefore I have vowed not to buy anymore TV series. For me TV series are best metered out in small doses and not in lump-sums. But that is just my opinion, maybe the reverse is true for you."
5,great classic TV series. Full of laughs,This was a great TV series. It is guaranteed to make you laugh. Lots of great on-liners. Every character in this series carries their own weight and contributes a lot of humor and entertainment to the entirety of the show.
5,Finally!!!!!,I so glad that they finally decided to release the next season. It has been so long since the 1st & 2nd Season Box Set was released. I had almost given up hope.
4,Good ideas but a lot of marketing,"While the ideas, 100 year outlook, do it now, use a highly qualified team, minimize taxes, etc. are excellent, I was somewhat put off by what I felt was a little too much self-praise and clearly a lot of personal marketing in th e book. As one about to embark on this quest, there was a dearth of positive information on the nature of some of the strategies."
5,"""I'm now living the perfect calendar!""","""Just as Intel redefined the universe for personal computers, Bruce Wright's ""EXIT STRATEGY"" redefined my personal universe. I'm now living the perfect calendar."""
2,SLC Punk cont.,"This movie to me really just felt like a new version of the movie SLC Punk. Besides having the nihilist in the Anarchist Cookbook, there are countless parallels between the two movies. Best friends, tragedy, group of counter-culture hacks, counter-culture hacks disappear, etc. etc.It was ok I guess and mildy entertaining, but not something worth purchasing. If you can rent it or buy it used for under $5 then sure, it might be worth checking out."
2,Weird movie,It's kind of a goofy movie. Nothing like what I expected. It's neither a comedy or a drama. A little of both. It follows a group of young people (well except the leader is old) who want to change the world but really just living haphazardly. More like hippies than anarchists. It's a group that looks out for each other...until Johnny Black comes into their lives and remakes the group into his idea of how it should be. Which is very destructive. Most leave. Puck doesn't like the changes and leaves but returns to take care of the remaining original members.I really disliked the ending. It was interesting in a mildly entertaining way but I can't recommend this movie.
3,Almost a remake,This movies is almost exactly like SLC Pink same style with the voice over and goofy characters. Except its set in Dallas Texas instead of Salt lake city utah.
4,Good movie about the coming of age in a lost youth,"Dallas, Plano, and the suburbs are what Puk thought he despised the most. He believed in freedom, no order, and self rule. Then life changed when Jonny Black came into the picture. Full of hidden little puns and quirks (Jonny Red vs. Johnny Black) ect... this film tells a tale of cautionary woes on who to value as friends, and what to truely believe in. I think this movie was a bit ahead of the times, poking fun at the republicans and the way that they were stearing the country at the time (look at the election results), but it also reminds us to not go to far the other direction either, because both extremes can have problems.""Take A Hit"", see this film, interesting enough to kill some time on a cold winters day."
3,fine by me,"First of all i really do not see the whole ""right wing propoganda"" that everyone else sees. I do believe that democrats are against anarchy as well. The only reason that this movie does not get a higher rating is because of the simple point that anarchist were represented very wrong, they are not hippies (well not totally, they are like angry hippies). And i don't think anybody should be represented in bad fashion (hippies). The plot did linger a bit, but the story was there. The reason it gets a 3 is because entertainment value was good (but only for a rental). If your looking for a good movie to buy about anarchy i would suggest SLC Punk, very well done. As for the ending, anybody who didn't like it is probably just some sad teenage anarchist that wishes they could live this life forever and not grow out of it. The fact is that anarchy will get you nowhere grow up and deal with it. Puck did."
1,Couldn't get into it,"I tried so hard to give this movie a chance. Right away, I noticed similarities to movies such as 'Fight Club', 'SLC Punk', and even 'Suburbia'. I recommend any of these three films, but can't do so for this one. Now that I think about it, it even features a basketball game that smacks of a scene from 'American History X'.From the first couple of minutes on, this film offered nothing original. From a technical standpoint, the shots are static and seem to go on too long. The writing is pitiful. The dialogue is unbelievable and made me roll my eyes so much that I memorized the inside of my eyelids.The extras are scarce; only a commentary from the director. I'd be willing to bet that there were enough goofs to warrant a gag-reel. With one of those, this may have scored two stars.Bottom line: the movie is distant, plodding, and predictable. The actors bring nothing original to the table. Some scenes seem meant to shock but fall short."
2,Lame Silly Ridiculous,"This mess is easily the worst attempt at portraying the punk/anarchist movement ever made. Add the horrible acting and idiotic conversation, and you got......just what you'd expect. Nothing Worth Watching! Boring soundtrack adds to the nauseating affect this will have on the viewer. Geez, tough lead character. Wears a pink button down shirt. The scenarios are crap, and sometimes border on preachy. Garbage through and through. Nothing funny in their attempts at humor. There's nothing going for this thing at ALL!! You gotta watch it just to see how horrendous and dull it actually. is. I warned you. Rent, do not buy. Unbelievable. SLC Punk thrashes this feeble attempt. One star for the gorgeous young ladies in this and the other star out of pure charity because I'm in a good mood."
2,A disappointment,"Although the movie did have a few redeeming qualities, I found it disappointing. As a student at Susman's high school and a memeber of the scene that his movie tried to represent, I was upset with the way it was portrayed. This is not because it was portrayed in a negative way, but because it was simply false. If it had been set in a different city with a different scene, I might have reacted differently, but it seemed horribly unrealistic and shallow."
1,"Very boring, very slow, horrible script.","The idea for this movie could have been good. But whoever wrote it needs a serious crash course on punk and what is means, and more importantly what it meant when it first became a major movement.The story moves painfully slow, having no real plot line whatsoever, and constantly changing direction. The acting leaves a lot to be desired, as does the basic script, as if the horrible outline wasn't bad enough, even the actors lines are written by someone who obviously doesn't know how to write, or write for the type of film this was supposed to be.I could not even finish this movie, it was that bad. I love indie films, and have a lot of respect for the people that put all that time and effort in making them, but this film flat out sucks. I don't recommend it for anyone."
1,Dreadfully Bad,"This movie is a complete misrepresentation of both anarchy as a philosophy and I hope it also misrepresents the way anarchists think. I'm not familiar with such a subculture as the one portrayed in this movie, but the logic employed by these characters is totally contrived, frivelous and ridden with cliches. Simply put, the writer is not smart enough to write to be writting about this stuff. I assure you that my hatred for this flick is not rooted in personal politics...its rooted in anger because I lost about 6 dollars to blockbuster and 2 hrs of valued leisure time. Anyone beyond a prepubescent brain capacity should NOT enjoy this movie. If anything, it has marginal comedic value as being a completely ridiculous joke but if that's what your looking for its still not very entertaining. That so many adults appreciated this film makes me very cyinical with regards to the general population and their capacity to think."
1,I hate this movie,"I found this movie to be extremely boring, and difficult to sit through. It was a complete waste of time. I wanted to watch the entire thing, in case the plot came together somehow. Speaking of which, the movie didnt seem to have much of a plot at all. The storyline was pretty weak, and the characters made me mad. It was just plain stupid. I wish I could give it a rating of zero stars.I wouldnt recommend this movie, unless you are a mindless zombie who finds watching pointless movies to be a positive step in your life."
1,A terrible waste of my time...,"We began watching this movie with the hope of being inspired into being better activists than we are today. However, after finishing this flick my husband and I both felt duped into watching it. Its fairytale ending, reeked of right-wing propaganda: anarchy can get you nowhere, go to school, fall in love with a republican christian girl and live the 'proper' life. I was disgusted and want everyone to know that this movie speaks nothing of activism. It praises Bush at one point, assocaites activists with nazis, and is just a huge dissappointment for all it could have been. I suppose the fact that you can rent or buy it and it hasn't been blacklisted should be enough proof that it has no content whatsoever."
3,b,"Summary:This was a movie about a guy who lives in a big crappy house with an overbearing, arrogant, nihlist bent on destorying all order, overthrowing the system and creating chaos. this nihlist then bulit up an army of militant goons who would do his bidding and cause havok. . . .wait, no that was Fight Club.THIS movie is about a young anarchist who isn't sure about what to do with his life, until his best friend, whome he lives with OD's on pills. after his friend's death, he decides to go back to college and lead a respectable life. . . .wait, no, wrong again.I was thinking of SLC Punk.Anarchist Cookbook is about a bunch of kids squatting in a crappy house and living for free, disrupting the public whenever possible. . . .no, that was Suburbia.What WAS this movie about????despite all that criticism, RENT it you you feel at all interested in seeing it, it wasn't that bad, just not real original."
1,Not fusion,"Don't listen to the reviewer who said this is a fusion album. It's more like smooth jazz, of a particularly syrupy variety. The only thing missing is Kenny G and Dave Sanborn. Those love and peace lyrics are pretty cheesy too."
4,One of Kinski's better performances.,"This movie has been well reviewed here, but here are some additional points: 1) Klaus Kinski has some lengthy scenes early on in this film, and at the very end, which he handles very well. But Kinski's presence in this bizarre creation amounts to perhaps ten percent overall, and as always his voiced is dubbed. 2) The story may be based on an Edgar Wallace novel but the events portrayed in this movie never make any sense at any time. 3) Besides the extraneous footage mentioned, whenever the story threatens to become predictable or just plain stupid, the events portrayed always revert to the exceedingly bizarre. 4) I can't really say this is a ""good"" movie (even as a good bad movie) but the attempt to film a murder mystery with multiple twists to the plot becomes so tortured and incoherent that it is well worth seeing."
4,Dead Creature With The Bloody Blue Hand...,"Originally titled: THE BLUE HAND, this movie was brought to the states by Roger Corman and re-titled: CREATURE WITH THE BLUE HAND. Then, some genius' decided to shoot extra ""gore"" footage ten years after the movie was filmed, and rename it: THE BLOODY DEAD! These added scenes (a nurse being shredded by two mental patients) are pointless and silly. Thankfully, we get both THE BLOODY DEAD and the BLUE HAND as a double feature! The original has plenty of suspense, mystery, and fun without the unnecessary, tacked-on mess. We have Klaus Kinski in a dual role as twins, one a possible maniac! There's the title killer w/ his blue hand, complete w/ finger-knives! There's the insane asylum, the castle full of secret passages, and inhuman torture using both rats and snakes! Excuse me while I change my drool bucket! Yep, this one's a classic. Just ignore TBD and stick w/ the non-padded version..."
2,don't get unless you just have nothing else to watch,"I like old scary movies, but these two are just not up to par. I did not care for either of the movies on this disc."
2,Klaus Kinski x two,"Edgar Wallace story also known as The Creature With The Blue Hand/Die Blaue Hand. One of a number of German films adapted from Edgar Wallace stories. Kinski plays twin brothers, one of whom escapes from a mental institution run by a madman."
4,I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE,I THINK THIS IS AN UNDERRATED FILM. IT IS BEST ENJOYED NOT TAKING TOO SERIOUSLY.THE PLOT HAS MANY TWISTS AND TURNS.I PARTICURELY LIKED THE BUTLER;HE STEALS EVERY SCENE HE IS IN.
4,Yeah yeah it's way dated but not bad for all that,"Released in the early 70's I believe, this book originally came out as part of a series by Pelican where each book detailed a different group of people. The Vikings, Anglo Saxons, Carthage and this book here on the Phoenicians were part of the series, all originally put out with a blue cover. The scholarship on all of them is presumably dated somewhat but this book is probably still a fine primer for anyone wanting to know a bit about this group of ancients. Brief, concise and with a minimum of jargon or any self important academic ranting this work will perhaps wet your appetite for further study in this area. I found it quite a brisk read and it certainly shed a little light on this brave seafaring race of people."
2,Not very good.,"I love Michael Crawford's version of Baby Mine, but did not enjoy any of the other songs. I don't know if he is unable to sing like he he used to or what, but he sounds very subdued throughout the whole album."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I'm a huge fan but was disappointed in this album. The selections aren't that great (compare to his charming ""When You Wish Upon a Star from a previous collection) and his vocals lack the energy of prior works. I'm hoping he does more songs from classic stage and screen, that's what his voice is trained to do."
3,Syrup over mickey's pancakes,"""Colors Of The Wind"" is the true winner here, along with the Lion King's Medley, and Michael Crawford does manage to do a heartwarming rendition of ""Baby Mine."" The rest of the album is more suitable for dinner over quiet candle light, or a quiet evening by the fire. Very melancholy, and very soft tones for some fine Disney songs, that bend to the tearful, thought provoking, and coping of life's daily struggles. Not for those who want to party at a Disney birthday hullabaloo!"
2,Crawford Creates Dismal Disney,"What ever happened to the days when the magical world of Disney would put a smile on your face and warm your heart with the hope of wonderment? If Michael Crawford's Disney Album is a reflection of the times, the days of youthful Disney are gone. Taking the majority of songs from more modern Disney features, Crawford sings such despairing hits as ""I will go sailing no more"" from Toy Story and ""I know the truth"" from Aida. His once robust voice now lulls these not-very-cheerful ditties and instead of putting a magical smile on your face, you're only left with a saddened heart. Sorry Walt."
4,A fun read for ANY comic book fan...,"I'll admit that Iron Man is not my favorite character, but this is still a darn good book. It does a great job of covering all aspects of Tony Stark/Iron Man's career/life including his origin, friends, enemies, and also personal tragedies (i.e. Tony' alcholism, health problems, etc.). It does have a little too much techno-gobleddygook talk for MY TASTES, but that's just me. Also, it tends too focus more on War Machine than on Tony/Iron Man, but War Machine IS cool, I'd just rather have seen him gotten his own book. Anyways, this is good one, enjoy!"
1,This fan is TOO LOUD,"I cannot run this fan and talk on the phone, it is that loud. And the fan is about 5' away from said phone.It does put out a nice breeze, but since I'm constantly having to get up to shut it off due to the noise, it's not very useful. I've had Boston fans before and they have been great, but this fan was a waste of money."
4,Darkly entertaining Vampire story,"Very different from Rice's novels, this vampire tale has it's own appeal. I found it seductive in many ways, from the hero's lost loves to the pathos in Liz's character as she lives with her burden of guilt. Slightly more in the romance novel vein than Rice, this one works well in its own right."
2,Disappointing,"This book is nothing like any of the Anne Rice books (people think it is just because it takes place in the american south and deals with a vampire).This book had very little in the way of vampire lore, and read more like a romance novel than a horror novel. The language was not as good as Anne Rice's either.I, too was hoping this would read like an Anne Rice book, but was disappointed (especially after browsing the horror section of the bookstore for almost an hour, looking for a good vampire story - most of the books seemed really cheesy, based on the description). I am confident that Wendy Haley will never replace Anne Rice as the queen of the supernatural. The caliber of writing in the Rice books is much higher (at least when comparing them to ""These fallen angels"".As an aside (and as my personal opinion), the Anne Rice's witch books (especially the first two) are even better than her vampire books."
3,Huh---okay. Not worth $5 though!!!!,I wouldn't reccomend spending money on this book. Borrow it or check it out at the library. Interesting though. Not at all like Anne Rice's books.
3,an interesting string of impressions on changing India,"This is a fairly typical jounalist's book. A good journalist for sure. It is full of sharp anecdotes and vivid vignettes of India's immense diversity.It is also a very disorganized book, his personal explanations intertwined with more detached historical explanations, eyewitness accounts and stories he picked up along the way.They style is uneven, at times fun and witty, at times rather boring.All in all a book that I would recommend, even with the reservations above, especially for readers who have never been to India or read much about the country."
5,There are better deals on this anime.,"You can get the first 3 dvds for the price of one individual, but for some reason on Amazon you can't. I'm not sure how or why they decided to distribute it this way at Walmart and Best buy, but I am very happy they did. These are the exact same dvds, in the same cases. The only difference is that they are bundled into one clear holding case.You can find it at Wal-mart, Best Buy or sometimes Sams' Club."
3,"Enjoyable ""B"" movie..","Engaging enough, funny, sometimes charming. Except for the brief scene about the alleged hooker, OK for kids. Some dialog in Spanish. Could be good practice for learners."
1,Bootlegs are illegal!!,I have recently purchase a movie from Amazon the quality was great but the DVD was a fake. It was a bootleg copy and is illegal in the US. Not to mention how much it cost for a fake movie.
1,Didn't Like the Profanity.,"This video would have been funny if not for the offensive profanity. I can overlook some, but not as much as this video contained."
5,Great movie!,This is a hilarious movie that is appropriate for family viewing. Martin Short is at his best. You will laugh until you have tears in your eyes. It is one of our family favorites!
4,Cult favorite in our home- for everyone,This hilarious movie is what we pull out and watch annually! Just wish it would come out on DVD- our tape is wearing out and getting old. What's the deal?? I would recommend this for the whole family-over 8-10years.
1,Pure Luck,This is supposed to be a new DVD from the Vault Series. It has multiple skips and is unwatchable. I would not recommend buying this product.
3,Pure Luck,Pure Luck is a very funny movie. Danny Glover plays a very patience cop who is sent to Acapulco with Eugene Proctor (Martin Short) to find Valerie (Sheila Kelley)who has mysteriously disappeared. If something can go wrong it will while Eugene or Valerie are around. The two men are beset by unimaginable mishaps over and over again which tries the detectives patience to the limits.Well worth watching for a good laugh.
5,Classic movie,I was so happy to find this movie finally available on DVD. Classic story of luck and faith that you should watch.
2,Movies,"I purchased this movie as I have been hunting for several years to find this movie in DVD format and this was the first time I was able to get it. It has always been in VHS format previously. However, I was disappointed in the tape quality. It has no menu for settings and the sound quality was very poor, from so soft to loud without the benefit of closed caption, I was constantly turning up my sound, or turning it down as it blasted in the room. I have loved this movie for years, as all I have shown it to, do also. This movie appears to be copied from a VHS format without the fundamentals that I was accustomed to in DVD format. I would have paid any amount to get the quality that I wanted (I paid $15.95). With that said, I really love this movie and have watched it many times, with my finger on the loudness button of my remote."
5,Great movie!!!,We've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for a long time. Great movie for the whole family to watch.
2,The movie was hilarious,The content of the movie itself was very good and very funny.My problem was that most of the tape had a buzzing or interference sound and distracted from the movie
5,Pure Luck,Martin Short is really funny and does a good job as a luckless executive and has no idea about his lack of luck. Danny Glover plays the dective that has to put up with Short's bumbling. When Short ends up with the rick man's luckless daughter it makes for a halarious ending. Good laughs all around and good acting too.
2,Love the movie but not the product!,I grew up watching this movie and have always loved it. I finally found it on dvd through Amazon and immediately ordered it. The dvd was defective. I could not watch it because it kept skipping scenes and the picture was all jumbled up. So I sent it back and ordered another one. It turned out to be the same way. I don't think it is my dvd player because I watch other movies all the time. It also would not play on my computer. I am so dissappointed. I don't know if I should order another one or not.
4,Just plain fun!,"If you like slapstick, this is the movie for you. I've searched local video houses for this one for my kids with no LUCK! My boys, 6 & 11, think it's hilarious. For good, clean fun, try this. Martin Short is a hoot!"
5,Great Movie,This is Martin Short at his greatest. Loved It. We will be watching it again over the Christmas Holidays .
1,Do not waste your money...,"This is bound to be the stupidest, most disgusting show ever. I can't believe that people actually bought the DVD. My advice? Don't waste your time or money."
4,The New Ferrari Model,"This FERRARI Model is designed to copy the newly released sports car. Its yellow paint catches people's interest easy enough, and this color is now very rare. If you check on Toyrus, yellow paint is not available throughout the Hot Wheels edition, so better get this fasttttttttttttttt!!!"
4,quirky instrumentation and rhythms,"although emo has been recognized more for the lyrical qualities that it puts forward in many different ways, the typical musical progression that bands like pedro the lion, built to spill, and 764-HERO is also a key element of this sub-genre. pele is a band that fits as an emo band even though they don't use any lyrics. the progression is the same, and you find the same kind of dreaminess that you would with a band like 764-HERO, although they have none of the vicious attacks that the latter sometimes throws in. this cd focuses on the keyboards and is the delightful jumpy sort of cd that you throw in when you aren't really in any sort of mood at all. definitely not pop, but something that you will still like to hum for days on end, even though the rhythms are pretty straighforward throughout the entire album. all in all, a pretty good album and definitely something that can be appreciated if you enjoy bands like the for carnation as well."
3,3.5 stars: sparkling and resilient instrumental rock,"Musically ambitious -and relentlessly productive- members of related bands such as Vermont, Promise Ring, and Collections of Colonies of Bees have drifted in and out of this loose Milwaukee association.Pele welds a sturdy and poised rhythm section to springy melodic energies typical of banjo and picked guitar, and the expansive possibilities of a full spectrum of synth and oscillator textures.This, their first (wordless) album, is consistently bright, and its tracks swell again and again with catchy arpeggiated chords and warm, tuneful harmonic slashes. Supremely likeable, it is well-worth having for those at all interested in this broad genre. The UK release on Rosewood Union adds three remixes, including two from the ""People Living With Animals. Animals Kill Peolpe"" record. Pele also has several subsequent releases, including the albums ""Elephant"" and ""the Nudes"", likewise solid by all accounts. Uh, there you go."
5,The perfect brow pencil,"I'm a natural blond. It's usually a challenge to find a pencil that is the right color for my fair skin and very light blond eyebrows. This one is perfect. The color is truly universal. I know this, because my dark brunette sister also uses the same pencil. And the crayon is great too, not too soft, not too hard. It lasts a long time! Get the pencil sharpener if you can find it. It's a perfect fit for the pencil. I first purchased this item in a beauty supply along with the sharpener. I'm glad Amazon has the pencil, but I can't find the sharpener here on Amazon.Either way, you won't be disappointed."
3,Description,"Lovely surroundings and a kind and considerate employer -- Beth was delighted at the prospect of her new job in Derbyshire.But when she arrived at Benedict House she discovered that it was not the sympathetic Mrs. Thornburn who required her services as a secretary, but her arrogant and completely unreasonable nephew.Could Beth put up with his insufferable attitude towards her?"
3,"The book is well-written, but does not cover much ground","First, my objective is to get certified in VB 6.0, and it seems that while this is a well-written book, it does not really cover that much ground. Why is it that MicroSoft can't come out with a book like the Waite Group's? I have also tried McKelvy's book, and I would not recommend it, first because he doesn't give you guidance through the code as well as Halverson, and second, the CDROM practice test did not work right. I'll stick with the Waite Group's book, thank you."
2,it's only so-so,"Although the book does fairly well in the begining, it later fails to educate in the end. If you only want to be able to do what the book teaches you to do, without understanding what it is you are doing- then buy it. It truely lacks educating, leaving beginers (this includes me)behind. Why do you put the code there? How do you debug?(the book tried to teach this- but failed) Some of the programs if typed literal- don't work. The truely sad thing is when you try to do exercises on your own- you can't. That is, any exercise that requires any understand! Pass it up!"
4,Well-structured learning kit,"I am experienced with a previous version of VB and needed something to help me learn the new VB 5 environment. This book got me up to speed very quickly. It is basic enough to cover things I might have missed, but comprehensive enough to be of value to experienced programmers"
5,"Two great, but obscure power pop albums on one CD","Evidently, this double disc was issued on an inferior label years ago, but fear not, this CD is well worth your money. It has been reissued and remastered and ""pops"" from your speakers. I was turned on to this band from the original LP promo years ago of ""Glass Moon."" That the band could admirably cover Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"" was eye-opening. And the high-voiced singing (Think Styx, Supertramp) is outstanding on ""Killer at 25,"" ""Simon,"" ""She's On"" and the Hollies' ""On a Carousel."" These are just a few of the high points. If you are a power pop fans (Phil Seymour, Dwight Twilley) you'll love this compilation."
1,Digitally remastered from original masters?I don't think so!,"Glass Moon, great performance. Digitally remastered from original masters, awful performance. Saddly, don't buy this CD."
4,Been quite a while since the previous review,"I thought folks might like to know I just received ""Jackson In Your House/Message To Our Folks"" from Amazon today. Based on my copy, it looks like Fuel 2000 fixed the swap problem. Oh yeah, and the recording's worth every cent, too."
5,Completely satisfied.,"I recently ordered this item as a birthday present for myself. It arrived promptly, and as soon as I opened the case, I was more than excited to say the least. It looks and sounds beautiful. The only thing I have had trouble with is that sometimes the keys stick on the keyboard, but other than that, I would recommend this item for anyone who is interested in learning how to play the accordion."
2,Does not work properly.,"This accordion is not at all worth the money spent on it, and I plan on returning it as soon as I can.My main problem with this accordion is that most of the bass buttons don't even work, and the few that do still sound very off-tune. I doubt everybody has experienced this problem, but I can't be the only one. The reeds are also either very loose or dislodged completely, which would cost a small fortune to get fixed. It does not play smoothly at all. The bellows are very stiff and often won't close all the way.The accordion does not look like the picture, either. The bellows are white with a red black and brown diamond design that does not match the rest of the instrument. There are also cheap looking colorful rhinestones all over it that are hardly visible in the photos given. The straps are extremely uncomfortable and difficult to attach.Overall, I would recommend you pay the extra 50 dollars or so and buy an accordion from a more well-known brand."
2,"It costs very little, and it shows","The accordion looks nice, but mine had problems of tuning and sticky bass button keys, with one button who was even engaging another one every time I was playing it, creating a terrible dissonance. I took out the bass button cover to see if I could do anything to fix it, and I was very negatively surprised by the poor quality of the valves and the poor craftmanship. I just put the cover back and returned the instrument. Thanks to Amazon. com for one of the best and more generous return policies in the retail business. As far as the Barcelona accordions brand is concerned, I think that, even for such a low price, it is possible to find better products.After having returned the Barcelona accordion, I subsequently purchased for the same price an accordion ""Bonetti"", made by Parrot (China) with the same number of bass and keys, and in all honesty it is much better."
3,"Not Bad, But...","Kaplan's SAT 2006 Premier Program was satisfactory. I found quite a few typos and errors throughout the program, especially in the book. The Writing section of the book was the most effective, but they didn't provide an adequate amount of information to score high on the Critical Reading section. A lot of the Math section example questions were redundant, and the overall Kaplan strategy of scoring higher on the SAT just didn't work out for me. My score was pretty average, and I was hoping Kaplan would help me exceed my expectations. I don't think I'll use Kaplan again. I tried their PSAT prep book as well, and once again, I got an average score. My average GPA currently is almost a 4.0, and I don't think my SAT scores represent who I am. Kaplan's Premier Program was just average-- it didn't help me get the score that I really wanted. I'd suggest trying something else."
3,not bad...,The book is ok but I wish that there was more practice on the CD with vocabulary words. Like someone said the grid-ins were scored wrong! It is ok but maybe there are other books more effective!
2,Not Recomended,"This book, explains in detail too much of the writing section, but not good on the ""critical reading"" and math sections. The math questions they provide does not align with the real questions asked in the New SAT. It has good explinations of the practice test, but the content wasnt all that great. I especially hated when this book gives you a list of words to remember and make you write them in cards. The other publishers GIVE you the cards, that you can just tare out, so that's the biggest downside. Again i do not recomend this, use Princeton, MCGraw, or Barrons. DO NOT BUT THE COLLEGE BOARD's."
1,Not good!,"This is basically just an expensive folded handkerchief -- and one that looks very strange when you put it on too: The product's picture does not show it, but the mask sticks out much further than it needs to. (In fact, it kind of looks like an inverted duck's beak!!)."
2,Missing 3.25 x 3.50 silicone piece!,"The intake is nice but when it got here the hard to find part silicone connector from air filter to tube was missing! Then I tried getting in touch w/ you guys and got the run around, then had to buy that piece out of pocket! Intake is great but missing pieces eventually costs more time & money!"
4,Review of Lewis's 'Mary Queen Of Scots',"This is a wonderfully written text. I was forced to read it for a class and ended up keeping it because it was a steady/easy read with more then enough information then was needed for class work. Lewis does a great job of convening a lot of the trials and tribulations of Mary. Highly suggested if you have a class and need something to study up on, have a report on Mary, or just want a book that talks about Mary, Queen of Scots without the tone of a boring history teacher."
4,"This cd will brighten up your days, I promise","This cd is a fine addition to my cd collection. I features the warm and friendly voice of Toni. It is probably one of her best cd ever.For this project, Toni decided to feature the traditioanl standards that we have come to love and cherish. What a treat it is to hear these old work horses again. Most of the songs featured her are my favorites.Also for this cd Toni choose to go with piano accompaniment only. This in my opinion was a good move. I have always considered the piano my favorite instrument for accompaniment.Recommendation: I think this cd is one that you must have."
5,Beautiful Brilliant and Wonderful!!,Miss Tennille is simply wonderful and the material chosen to perform is beautiful.. Every track is a gem... Highly Recomended!
2,truth about kerry,the story was too dark for us. we past it to others and they said it was too dark also. i wouldn't recommend to any one.
2,meh,"Not that I had big expectations, but from a low budget movie I wanted something more in terms of plot, very predictable.At least the performances of the two lead actors were solid, Stana Katic still a little rough but consistent.Good Soundtrack."
1,"Brutal, Unsatisfying Ending Ruins the Film","SPOILER ALERT The movie has several gaping plot holes. An American woman is found on the beach clad only in a bra. We eventually find out she was raped and strangled and drowned. So even though there would be bruises of all kinds and other evidence of rape, its decided she just drowned. Her BFF comes over from America obsessed with the idea she was murdered and then at the end of the movie suddenly decides she committed suicide and leaves. I could forgive all this if the killer didn't get away with it. All we are left with at the end is that the brutal deed was done and no one suspects or cares that it happenned. Stana Katic is great. With her drippy hair and glasses you only occasionally see the beautiful woman we see on Castle. But every once in a while you catch a glimpse of how beautiful she is even pre-nose job. Her acting is superb."
2,Don't bother,"I purchased these about 18 months ago. I have broken 2 bowls, 4 of the small plates and 1 large plate. The 2 bowls were my fault, but the plates all broke so easily. Once I was cutting a piece of chicken with a steak knife and the plate broke. They have even chipped in the dishwasher. They are way too large. We hardly ever use the large plates because they are simply too big. We use the small plates for all of our meals. I mostly use the large plates as platters. They are pretty but I'm sure there are much better quality out there."
5,Like a Pop/Rock 2fer Blast from the Past!,"Recently while traveling out of town I heard the song Nicole on the radio. How cool! I hadn't heard it in years and couldn't remember who it was by. It sorta stuck in my mind so I did the research and discovered Point Blank CD's on Amazon. I didn't really understand initially but this turns out to be two albums combined on one disc. I didn't remember until it arrived but ""On A Roll"" is an album I'd bought clear back in 1980 that had some great music on it too!"
5,Southern Rock At It's Best!,"I've had ""Airplay"" on vinyl for years and love it. I ran across this double cd and thought I'd check it out and WOW! This is a great two-on-one cd. I love every song here. Great guitars...great keyboards...great vocals! Point Blank is an extremely overlooked old rock band. Sadly, they just don't make em like this anymore. This is one of the best cd purchases I've made in recent months. Highly recommended!"
5,Awesome!,"I'll be honest. I downloaded this book because it was free but man, was I impressed! It was fantastic. Easy to follow and interesting. I'm certainly buying the other 2!!"
2,Almost Perfect,I'm sorry to say this but I could not finish this book. I read a couple chapters but it was one that did not work for me.
2,Ok.,This book was ok but the plot was too predictable and a little slow. It didn't keep my interest and I found myself skipping parts. Not my cup of tea.
4,Not too shabby :),"Thought there would be more input from the two friends, but overall was a good read. I plan on continuing the series."
4,Great book!,This is the first book I've read by Julie Ortolon and I have to say that I'm ready to finish the Perfect Trilogy. I really enjoyed this book and hope you will too.
3,I liked it,I thought it was an interesting story. I like the quotes at the beginning of the chapter. I think it shows what happens when you face your fears.
2,Too much sex in the book,"The story line was good, but I kept skipping over the sex, I don't need filth to light up my life."
1,I hated this book.,I hated this book. Did not like the smut and wasn't aware it contained this. I wish I had not purchased the book
2,Wordy and not christian fiction,"The book was okay for the free price if you aren't bothered by sex passages. I did search for Christian fiction and this was definitely not that. It had explicit sex scenes and comments that made anything good about the book disappear for me. Therefore, I was very disappointed."
5,I want,"I received this for free. I felt drawn from the first page. There were no typos which is nice considering there are so many books out there that are. I understand fear, and afraid that they will never accomplish lifes goals. I believe in first love and what it means to have commitments, and fears. That is all I am going to say.Thank you for the well written story."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"If it weren't for the sex scenes, I'd say this was written for adolescents. The two main characters are still acting like they did in high school 15 years later. I was hoping one or the other would come to their senses and realize their ""great love"" wasn't worth the time. But they didn't.I won't be wasting any effort reading the other two books in the trilogy."
3,Rather predictable,"I liked this book but felt it was predictable. I thought the will-he-or-won't-he rather overplayed, perhaps because our hero, Joe, tended to whine...a lot, as did our heroine. I did want to smack them and tell them to straighten up and act like the 30-somethings they were supposed to be. The ancillary characters were all well drawn, with distinct personalities that added to the story. This is probably one of the better plotted chick-lit novels I have read. So I'm really on the fence with this one. On the one hand the story kept me reading with interest but I was often annoyed with our H/h."
1,Almost Perfect,"The vulgar language and swearing ruined the book, even though the story was good. I will not read this author's books again."
3,Dragged a bit in places,"The book was slow to start, but after a few chapters, I found myself really enjoying the interactions between the main characters. I could understand the lingering feelings between them after so long, and I could also understand why they would be tentative with each other so as not to damage the fragile relationship they'd started to build. I thought the last few chapters dragged a bit also, but overall, I enjoyed the book enough to give the second one in the series a try."
4,Enjoyable Read,I got this title when it was offered free.I really enjoyed this novel. I liked the premise that each character would have their own story to tell.I loved the interaction between all of the characters. It wasn't forced and the plot and story had a great flow. Others have discussed the plot in detail so I don't need to go on about that.I have just bought the other two in the series and can't wait to see what unfolds for Christine and Amy.
5,Great story!,"I really enjoyed reading this book, though some of the arguments between the two main characters were kind of moronic. I sometimes got the impression that the author really didn't understand how men think or act. Other than that, it was great."
4,Almost Perfect,This was a good book! I can't wait to read the other two books in this series - gonna start the next one now :)
3,Fun Book,"It was an enjoyable book and certainly a fun read. I did feel that the heroine's thinking process was incredibly irrational, even based on her background. Both the hero and the heroine made such stupid conclusions from the facts at hand that it was difficult to believe them. People, yes even people in love, are capable of much more logical trains of thought."
5,Julie Ortolon at her best!,"Julie Ortolon does it again--women who go after what they want, heroes to die for, interesting plotlines and exquiste emotion. Combine these with a reunion story (don't we all love these?) and you have the perfect (not almost perfect) book for romance readers. Bravo, Ms. Ortolon."
1,Boring,This book was very boring and conflict was so high school. This is the first book by this author and last book I'll read from her.
3,quick read,I liked the book as I was on holiday and it read quick andeasy - little concentration needed. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered the other womens story. I still have the last one to read. Julie Ortolon has a way to keep my interest in her story line. I have ordered more of her books and finished her Pearl Island trilogy.
3,Bland and Predictable,Ortolon is a very good writer but there was not much going on in the book that hasn't been done before. The plot was very predictable and left no mystery. Basically three friends are angry (but not really believable) with their friend for publishing a book using their lives as an example on not what to do. So they make a pact to get over their fears and live life. Disappointingly it was not as witty and entertaining as I had hoped. With the bland dialogue it was hard to stay interested. I am glad that I did not pick up the other two in the series.
3,NOT Almost Perfect,"I had high hopes for this novel based on the synopsis, but ended up disappointed. It started out good and it wasn't exactly bad, but just kind of blah and very formulaic. It wasn't funny enough to be a romantic comedy and it didn't have enough substance or depth to become something more. I ended up reading something else that came in before I finished this book and completely forgot about it! I ended up coming back to finish it and although it wasn't terrible, I found it to be not really very exciting. I really wanted to like it more than I did. I was more interested in the secondary characters, the camp and the art than I was in the romance.Thankfully this was a Kindle freebie!"
3,Loved the story. Hated the X-rated material.,"If there was not so much profanity (Amazon would not let me give examples, because they were too awful) and the explicit, tell-it-all sex had been removed, this would have been a much better story. Had Joe and Maddy still been so attracted to one another but had refrained from actually having sex this time, the tension would have been higher, and the reader would have been held captive. I can't believe it was listed under Christian fiction. It is not!The ending was also rather weak. Joe and Maddy still seemed to have a lot of unresolved problems and baggage. Yet, despite these overwhelming weaknesses, the story was otherwise well-crafted and the characters likable and interesting. If it was cleaned-up, I would give it a five."
2,Predictable,"An easy read but too predictable. Yes, this is a romance novel, but there was just constant sex here and there. No substance, no struggle, no depth to the story. Man gets mad, woman gets mad, fight turns to passionate sex. Didn't see THAT coming. Oh wait, he's mad again. Well, you know how the story ends. I'm not saying this was a horrible read, but it's just not a great read. I'm glad it was free otherwise I would have been seriously annoyed I paid for this instead of something I may have really enjoyed reading."
3,It was an enjoyable read,I enjoyed the characters and the story line. It was a good read and it held your interest. Will look forward to reading the remaining two books in the trilogy.
3,Easy Reading,"This was an easy book to read and was entertaining but predictable. I won't be reading again, but it was a cute story."
4,Really good story,"This was a wonderful story, and sets up the next book without leaving you hanging. I smiled throughout the book. It keeps you wanting to read, and the plot is traditional but the setting is new and I like that, a must read, cannot wait to read the next two."
5,Perfect,"I was a little worried after reading the first chapter of this book. I thought the author would cover the stories of 3 good friends in one book. I'm so glad that I was wrong. This book was perfect as it is for me. The details made the story so real. I laughed really hard at times and sometimes had tears in my eyes. I love how the main characters had a history together. I love the ending. I will definitely buy other books from this author. Yes, I would recommend this book to a friend."
4,lilting liftoff,"ascending via the smooth jazz guitar genré Nite Flyte hits the target. If you like Ken Navarro, you`ll hop aboard and take the flyte as they take you to a higher sensory plane (sic). Nice."
4,A book that makes small kids feel big,"Piglet is sad! There are so many things he cannot do. ""I am too small to do anything at all,"" Piglet sighs. Then Pooh and his other friends point out all the great things Piglet can do.This a cute, well-illustrated story with familiar characters. It makes a great ""shared"" reader, and has a message that will resonate with most two and three-year olds. Be prepared to read this book to your toddler again and agian.Because of the large print, and limited number of words on the page, older kids might also enjoy tackling it and doing some ""independent"" reading. However, the book does not use many sight words, so would require a lot of initial parental help or a good handle on phonics."
3,For Deborah Shelton fans only,"The luscious Deborah Shelton sort of reprises her role as the object of a peeping tom's obsession (Body Double). This B-movie lacks the wit and campy horror of Body Double, but we do get to see healthy doses of the fine Ms. Shelton. I only wish Amazon offered Sins of the Night and Silk Degrees."
5,Very Challenging,"There are 2 CD's for half the price of one. The 123 games are challenging, fun and educational. I highly recoomed these CDs for ages 4 - 6."
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed by the organization. This CD focuses mainly on letter recognition rather than accurate letter-sound association. The directions for each task were difficult to understand. The introduction was too long. I work with a special education population and programs whose introduction is long loses the attention of many of the children. There was confusion between letter names and the sound they produce within words. The program included blends in the letter/sound recognition tasks which is confusing for children; often, these concepts are taught in simple one syllable words avoiding words with digraphs and blends."
2,I Need More Clues Blue !!!,"My problem with this CD is the lack of concise instructions.My husband and I had a hard time figuring out how to make the words ,and where to place them.Also, alot of the games are so convoluted.I think that the real reason my three year old hasn't gotten discouraged and stopped playing is because it's Blue.Plese more clues Blue!"
3,Captures attention,I purchased this software for my 3 year old son. At the time of purchase he was 2 1/2 and I needed some software that would keep his attentionlong enough to learn some basic preschool concepts. Since he was a big fan of Blue's Clues I thought it would be perfect. The program did capture his atttention right from the start. The characters all had their own versions of play and covered seperate concepts. The games were a little to simplified at times and some of them seemed to be to hard for he age of my son. I feel that the program would have been better if skill levels could have been altered for the different age groups of 3-5. Overall the software was definately worth the cost and just as importantly it made learning fun for my child.
3,Experienced Cooks Only,"Very high-brow recipes that come from mainly European countries such as France and Spain. If you're looking for a healthy eating guide, such as learning how to substitute olive oil for butter and how to cook less meat-oriented meals, this is not the book. I studied the Mediterranean Diet Food Pyramid, which this book seems to turn upside-down. Many recipes call for milk and cream and most recipes are 2 pages long. Individual Beef Wellingtons - doesn't sound very healthy to me! This is a good choice for Gourmet Cooks looking for more wordly recipes!"
3,Her old French cookbook,"This seems to be generally European/French cooking with olives thrown in. Quinelles? Pate? When did those become part of a healthy, light diet? Most of the recipes are heavy on the cream, too. Not what I was looking for."
1,No photos!,"I just don't like cookbooks with no photos. Without photos, they don't inspire me. I didn't even read this book and returned it to the library so I cannot comment on how good the recipes were."
3,Somewhat of a let down after the original Screamers,"I have long been a fan of the original with Peter Weller but this sequel lacked much of the punch and dynamics of the original - I watched it and almost regretted buying it, almost. If you are expected the same strong story line and performances of the original this will fall short."
2,Good content but very poorly organized :-(,"This is a widely used text and the authors certainly are recognized authorities in the field. The overall content is broad and appropriate, however, the text is very disorganized and poorly written. There is no sense of coherent progression of concepts and the authors frequently include extraneous information which is distracting. The approach attempts to break down the various aspects of Schenkerian Analysis by separately discussing bass lines, melodic structures, formal design, etc. but it is very unclear as to the relationships of the various aspects and is inconsistent in it's own use of the analytical language. The sequencing of the text makes it difficult to glean a holistic understanding of the method. In a graduate course I took recently, the professor spent large portions of class just answering questions about places we were confused by the text. A lot of students just took lecture notes and stopped reading the text all together."
2,It's on the jittery side,"Got mine for a great deal at a box store a couple of days ago, but might take it back in the end. The mousepad is sooo sensitive, it makes the cursor jump around all over when you are typing...so there you are typing an email and boom...where'd the cursor go? It's two lines up typing in the middle of a different sentence. And it did this over and over and over. I have an old Dell laptop with the same style mouse and it never does that.Otherwise I like it so far, but a very basic thing like that gets annoying very quicly, so if you get one...check out that issue."
1,Do not buy this!!!,So i neglected to do research before purchasing this computer. Boy was that a mistake. It seemed like it would be a great notebook that had all the specs I needed. It took about two hours before the screen went black the first. I lost count at 25 times after that. I took it back to Best Buy and they were very sympathetic to my dilema. They gave me another one to take home and I thought my problems were solved...boy was I wrong. The same thing happened again and I had to take it back. At this point I decided to buy a more expensinve HP instead and I have been more than satisfied. Dont buy this computer unless you want a one headache after another.
3,"Runs well, but not well enough","This is my very first laptop, one my parents bought for use during college. I'm glad to say it's lasted that long and more, but it lost parts along the way. The enter-key and pgdwn-key fell of within the first two months, and for some reason Windows Explorer keeps stalling and the taskbar freezes. During the best of times, it runs and edits videos fine, but on the worst of times it's sluggish and freezes while I'm trying to watch videos off of Hulu. This sluggish behavior started around one to two years after I got it, and has progressively gotten worse since then.There are plenty of better laptops for common scholastic use, or for video gaming. I do both, and this laptop cannot handle gaming, video editing, and basic research needs. However, I'm glad this laptop has lasted so long (over 5 years), but I think I'm just going to buy a quick n' easy new netbook for one-half the price."
5,works great,"I use this laptop almost every single day and it works great with no problems. I dual-boot Vista and Ubuntu although I rarely use the Vista boot because I run XP under a VM in Ubuntu. If you use the laptop for serious work I recommend increasing the memory to its 4gb limit.Things I like about this laptop:* keyboard feels good. I use an IBM Model M keyboard on my desktop so I know what good tactile feedback should feel like.* touchpad works well* suspend/resume takes about 2 secondsIssues:* the webcam is ok, not the greatest, but I don't use it anyway* when I bought the laptop (2007) Linux did not have drivers for wireless. I had to wait till march 2008 to get wireless to work. but now it works great."
1,DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP,"This is one of the poorest performing laptops that I have experienced. It is sloooooooow beyond words. It freezes often and needs to be rebooted. I was thrilled with the price but after using this for just a few moths, I am going to kick this one to the curb and buy something else. I don't know if Toshiba is the problem or Windows Vista but this is NOT a laptop that you want."
1,Completely Dissatified!!! Two bad motherboards,"I bought this at Best Buy locally. I recieved my first one and the screen would suddendly go blank. I would have to restart it by pushing the power button. I took it to get diagnosed and it was a bad motherboard.Just recieved the replacement. It did the same thing the first time I used it. Assuming the motherboard is bad.When I took this one back, I was told that there was another one that came in with a bad motherboard.I am extremely disappointed that if I could give it Zero stars I would. Please buy something else and save yourself the headache.Don't know what features I like since it didn't stay on long enough to really use the computer!"
3,Blue Screen of Death: Hoping Our Hair Grows Back,"We've had Three Toshiba A215-S7422s#1 - Missing pixels on screen - exchanged for #2#2 - Wireless card didn't work - exchanged for #3#3 - Blue Screen of Death - see Ricardo, Michael Ditowsky and Rajeesh belowSupplement to their very good info1) DO NOT CALL TOSHIBA - This only added to our aggravation - the phone attendent, no doubt on the other side of the planet, seemed as if he were reading que cards to respond to our questions, and denied any knowledge of such a problem as the BSOD.2) Best path to Advanced power options in Vista is: Start, Control Panel, CLASSIC view, Power Options, Turn Off Display (to access next link (proc pwr mgmt)), processor power mgmt, change minimum processor to 100% (though we're also going to test 50%). Also may want to change battery/plugged- in options to ""never""3) Cross your fingers, knock on wood, throw salt over your left shoulder, and kiss your wife. Good Luck."
3,Fixed Black Screen,"I purchased the laptop before reading the reviews about the ""black screen"" issue and sure enough, my screen was going out on a daily basis. I did call Toshiba to see if I could just get a replacement and they said they dont do replacements. This was already my 2nd one because my first one had a dead pixel. As a last resort I set my minimum CPU usage at 100% (as someone had suggested on a different review site) and it fixed my problem."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER,"This computer is VERY slow. I don't know if it's because of AMD or Toshiba. Internet takes forever, even though I have high speed wireless. Sometimes the fingerpad doesn't work, sometimes the keyboard doesn't work(like it freezes up randomly). Also, sometimes the screen randomly turns white and all I can do is turn it off and restart it, losing anything that was unsaved.It seemed fine when I first got it; all the neccessary programs installed easily. Vista sucks, especially when transitioning from Windows. For a high school or college computer, I would NOT recommend this. Mine is being returned."
1,Toshiba laptops suck @ss,I have an a75 the class action lawsuit model. It has been crap the whole time i've owned it. almost three years and still sucking. Just sent it in for the 6th time not to count the times i've used the recovery cd. I say get the word out they suck. Word of mouth is still the best way to spread truth and it needs to be spread until they start creating a real product and not a shell of one. Don't bother with tech support. they couldn't fix a cup of coffee. I was thinking about buying this model because of the price but I'm glad I research it on the internet.
4,"Great laptop, except for black screen of death","I really enjoy using this laptop, everything was as expected. lots of people complain about the mouse cursor jumping around when typing, here's how to fix that: when you type, to disable the touch pad, press the FN button (located on your keyboard, next to the CTRL button), hold and press the F9 button, located on top of the row of number button. Doing so will disable the touchpad. to enable it again, simply hold FN and F9.about black screen of death: i don't know how to fix that. Does any know how to do that? i would really appreciate it if you can email me and help me out, it really annoy me. my email is: madison010101@yahoo.com. thank you and god bless all those who help."
1,Toshiba A215-S4747,"I bought this Toshiba A215-S4747 about two weeks ago and returned it a week later (Aug. 2007) because I (like other reviewers here) started getting the blanking screen problem. The specs look great on paper, but if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. Like others, the screen on my unit would just go blank (black) right in the middle of whatever I was doing and there was no way to get the screen to come back other than doing a hard power reset."
5,Attila,"A true-life love experience was transformed into a love story. Peter Hargitai described how rough, yet how good love can be. At first dealing with communism and ending with love. This novel shows that if you really love some one or something, go for it. Who cares about what everyone else thinks or believes it. It is you as an individual is what really matters. That is what happened with Attila. He fell in love with an American girl, Millie, who was not approved of by Attila's parents. But like I mentioned before, Attila was an individual, who did not care about what anyone else though, which is what made him a stronger person. I think that if you can do that, be your own man, than you are someone that can surpass many obstacles."
4,Awesome Book!!!,"""Attila : A Barbarian Love Story,"" is a book based on the life of Peter Hargitai. This book is about how he lived in Hungary and how his family escaped communism and came to America. Throughout the novel, Hargitai manages to provide a reader on how he becomes liberated, free and falling in love. This book was great because it was not based on one theme. It was based on history, adventure and my favorite romance. Attila's relationship with Millie is a beautiful one. He changes his life for her and together they overcome the odds such as having different families and cultures. They face hard times and through it all they stay by each other's side. I enjoyed this book and could not put it down once I began. This book intrigues any reader by them feeling as if they were there in the exact moment as the story unfolds."
4,Crystal Loriga's review on ATTILA,"I thought Attila was a great story. I loved hearing about how you and Millie met and fell in love. I also like the way you could describe how you were at a young age and as a teenager to an honest fault. You concentrated more on emotions that on the story itself but thats what makes it your own style of writing. The story in the beginning got me lost until you started talking about your move from Hungary to America. I find myself questions whats real and whats not. I like the way you used real language from today. It helps me to understand where you're coming fromThey were some odd characters like your aunt. It's interested to hear that there are people like that in Hungary. Your love story was a tale on innocence, infatuation, and love for the first woman who drove your body on its heat drive to no end. Millie sounds like an average girl with an average crazy father, a little perverted though. It's good that nothing is too out of the ordinary."
4,intense love story,An appealing love story of a teenager who falls deeply in love with a girl that was forbidden to be with him. An intense story from the beginning to end. It honestly kept my heart pounding fast as I was reading through the final chapters. It reminds you of when your parents try to take over your life and one day you just snap and begin to take over it yourself. It leaves a piece of advice to just be who you really are and not who your parents want you to be. Peter Hargitai has once again created a success story that reaches everyone's heart.
4,beautiful love story,Fascinating story of a family who moved from Hungary to the US. Heartwarming personal stories of friendship bonds as well as the tribulations within family relations. And the passion and innocence of young love. Slow start but very exciting end. You finish the book feeling great for the lead characters.
4,Great novel,"Atilla: A Barbarians love Story a great novel. It explores many different aspects like culture differences, racism, love, parental dissaproval, and hate. There are many dimensions to it. It is full of passion and it is obvious the author is too. Beautifully written, raw and real! It has all the makings of a great novel."
4,Like no other,"Wow, what a book. Really this book is well written, and the descriptions are great. Reading it is like being in a stadium seated movie theatre as every scene is able to be conjured up in your imagination. Peter Hargiti really hit the nail on the head when he wrote this book. His truthfullness kept the book interesting as his drama of a life unfolded. I usually thought Autobiographies were boring but this book was different. It was exciting, dramatic, raw, and just excellent.Many writers ""write"" about their lives, but to allow the readers to not only read, but live part of what you did shows true talent. This book is just as good as any other five star written by million dollar writers, and deserves real acknowledgement.This book is the beginning of a new era and style of writing. This book is a book to read and to miss out on a chance to read it is a shame. It's a great novel, and once started it's almost impossible to put down."
3,Attila,This book is absolutely great because it deals with various taboos that will interest most any fan of modern writing. The book takes you on one man's journey through life. Starting out with a great escape from violent Hungary. With dark humor and brilliant metaphors a story that begins with incest and death eroticism evolves into an American love story dealing with an adolescents inner struggles with love vs. family. The in your face honesty of the author makes you connect with his younger self in the book. It is a brave tale to write and superior one to read.
4,attila,"As soon as you start to read it, you will want to finish it right away!! Peter hargitai is an amazing writer, he shows who he really is without having to lie. This is a romantic love story, and how two lovers go through a lot of difficulties to be together. You could tell how much attila loved millie, and how he was going to do justa bout anything to be with her again. I recommend this book, for any person, its great! The book will keep you entertained throughout the entire book."
4,Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story,"Attila proved itself to be a marvelous and compelling work of art. The title alone grabbed my attention from the moment I first purchased the novel. Hargitai imprisoned the struggle of life not only as an immigrant trying to find himself in a new environment, but also as a confused hormone driven adolescent. This is a story filled with passion, love, and adventure. I recommend this book to everyone; it's a great inspiration from start to finish."
4,Alessandra Carrillo,"This book is definately an attention getter! It's a bit different from other love stories. It's about a young boy who deals with many obstacles in his life. He deals with the move from his home in Hungary to a foreign place in the United States. He has to learn to keep his Hungarian ways and still try and maintain a normal life. When Atilla meets Millie, the book turns into a whole new adventure. Falling in love and enduring many obstacles are just some of the things that happen in this book. If you like reading about adventure, love, and surprises then this book is definately for you."
4,Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story,"""Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story"", is an intense story that makes you see life in a different way. This book shows Attila's ups and downs. Even though some people get an easier life, this book shows many problems you may never face. I thought the book was great, showing different sides, for instance how some people are cruel to others, making them feel bad or frustrated, but at the same time how they start growing and maturing. I think this is what I like the most about the book, at the beginning showing how Attila was a fearful boy and at the end rebelling going where he wanted it to go, getting things done his way. I really recommend this book to everyone."
4,Attila (A Barbarian's Love Story),"This novel is a biographical fiction in which I feel is timeless because any generation would be able to relate to its captivating story. The difficulties Attila experiences with his family, spouse, and dealing with death are all a part of life. His critical and racist family members were not easy to grow up with, but through it all, Attila rose above it to meet the silver lining through the dark clouds of his life, Millie. This novel of heart ache and conflict will leave readers feeling that they can surpass any obstacle and come out the other end."
2,Anglocentric and Biased,"Basically this books takes the idea that Indians were just waiting around to prove themselves loyal to whites, meaning we just couldn't wait to become Tontos to white people's Lone Ranger. Well, we don't put our lives on the line to just to please the white man. We have our own reasons for joining, and it's a shame Berstein never figured them out.If you want a look at government policy during the war, this is your book. If you want to learn about Indians in the military, try Tom Holm or Al Carroll."
3,Jingle all the way.,"This is a promotional CD-ROM that was given away by JCPenney in 2000. It features some material that can be used on your computer, most notably a JCPenney's catalogue that is of no use to anyone in 2007. It also features five songs that can be played on a CD player, which is what is of interest to me. The performers are an R&B; singer named Vega, a folk singer named Alice Muson and an Eddie Vedder soundalike named Jesse Spradley. Jesse Spradley's performance isn't very good, but the other two singers do a decent job. Here is the complete track listing:1. ""Jingle Bells"" - Vega2. ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" - Alice Muson3. ""O Holy Night"" - Jesse Spradley4. ""It Came Upon a Midnight Clear"" - Alice Muson5. ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" - Vega"
3,Horse swing,"The swing arrived in very bad shape. First of all let me say, it is very heavy. I think the shippers must have dropped it a couple of times. The iron work with the horse images was cracked and broken in multiple places. It would have cost a fortune to ship it back to the store, so I had to pay someone to weld the various pieces back together. After that, it is a very nice swing and as I said very heavy duty."
5,One Classy Lady,"From movies like Summer Stock, Summer Holiday and more recently Out to Sea, this is one very tallented LADY!!! This beautiful actress (even at her age today) can still do it all, act, sing and dance. At 47, I am so glad I was raised loving this kind of music and these kind of wonderul movies. Today's Hollywood seems to want to ""hide"" our tallented and hopefully still acting golden stars. They paved the was for the upcoming stars. I hope Ms. DeHaven is around for a while longer and would consider recording again soon...After all....Bob Hope's wife did it a few years ago.....WHY NOT GLORIA!!!!!!!!!!! I love this recording and glad to be able to play it as often as I want. Thanks for sharing your gifts with the rest of us Gloria DeHaven......sure would be nice to meet you in person some day and hear you sing!"
3,glad it's available,"Before Gloria De Haven became a star at MGM, she was a band singer for Bob Crosby and Jan Savitt's orchestras. I'd love to hear those recordings but these are radio transcriptions she made during the 40's. Her lovely smoky voice was quite the contrast from her sweet screen image. Although I like her film roles like Summer Holiday, I wonder what could have happened if she continued soley on singing. There are two duets from film co-stars June Allyson and Frank Sinatra, but he's not listed. There was a now out of print cd from Hitland a few years ago paired with Pier Angeli, that contained songs from Gloria DeHaven's movies. That's worth tracking down too.Unfortunately the back insert of the cd forgets to mention that 4 is Blue Moon as a result the numbering is off. But this is my only quibble."
3,First comprehensive story?,"I found Venkatesh's book to be quite compelling, yet I took issue with the book jacket's contention that it is ""the first comprehensive story of daily life in an American public housing complex."" There was once written a book, ""Behind Ghetto Walls"" by Lee Rainwater in 1970, regarding the former Pruitt-Igo project in St. Louis. This book, too, is a comprehensive study on daily life in a project, and an excellent one at that."
3,likinstik,"""American Project"" started out with the best of intentions, but along the way ,the author became a little repetitive. He should've explored the lives of the tenants a bit more. I think that would've made their situation a bit more understandable for the unaware. But, I give the author credit for trying to explain the lives,situations and forces, which keep the people disconnected from the rest of Chicago."
2,Misguided thesis,"Venkatesh is pushing the thesis that the lives of the residents in the 'projects' have been too pessimistically portrayed by other authorities, and that for long periods of time they in fact managed to get along pretty well, through various informal and often criminal survival mechanisms they developed.That is, as I say, his thesis. I am reminded of a story of a man who fell out the 40th story window of an office building. Mid way down, with his eyes firmly closed, he imagined himself flying.""So far, so good,"" he said.This author records comparable delusions, and the state of free-fall that of necessity must end. He thinks he is recording something better than that."
2,Chock full of stuff but painful to read and hard to use.,"This book has lots of financial worksheets and checklists, but they're not written in a helpful manner or format. Plus, you end up entering much of the same info into many checklists over and over again. Worse, the text is really painful to read. It's not broken down into bite-size pieces or written in plain-English. And I have to agree with Mr. Bingham that it is hard to use the CD-ROM because you have to click into each folder to see what's there and then click into BOTH the PDF forms and text forms folders, because sometimes the forms in the two folders are just duplicates of each other while other times a form only exists in one folder or the other. In short, the book is heavy on forms and worksheets whose usefulness is questionable, and light on text."
3,Hmmmmm,"Not exactly what I was expecting this to be. It plays like a conspiracy theorists dream. ""The man"" is hiding valuable information on the Dead Sea Scrolls. ""The man"" doesn't want you to know about them. They present some information that was never released to the public. Um, how did they get ahold of this? They claim these documents are surrounded by poison gas, high security alarms, and other whatnot and that they haven't 'seen the light of day in thousands of years'. Then how the hell do they know what they say? It's almost laughable, they way this is presented. I cannot and will not say ""stay away"" because underneath the hype there is some actual decent information, it's just the conspiracy theory approach they take on this is almost stupid."
2,I've seen better,I've saw much better documentaries on the Dead Sea Scrolls. There wasn't as much real information on it as i hoped and the author had a religous slant that i did not think was appropriate.
3,Mysteries of the Dead Sea Scrolls Exposed,"I am a believer in Jesus Christ and am born-again. I believe that God has created an infinite amount of things in this existence that we will NEVER know about as finite human beings. Many don't care, don't believe, and/or are afraid to admit they believe in things such as UFO's, demons, the Devil, conspiracies, etc. However, that said, I do believe in these things but most of the information that is ""out there"" is like a bottle of fuit juice..the can specifically says ""Contains 10% fruit juice"", meaning that only a small percentage of the content is legitamite.However, I don't DISBELIEVE per se the contents of this video nor Dr. Stranges, but we are all human and subject to inconsistencies and errors. This video is interesting but lacking more substance. Some might really enjoy it... I did, and some might think it's hogwash. In the end, I am a firm believer that it is Jesus Christ that really matters."
4,Keeping in Step,"The music is great and the entire workout is high energy. Some of the combinations are hard to grasp but the rhythm is such that you can do your own thing and then join back in. It is tremendous fun, all-absorbing, and a great way to forget about everything except keeping yourself moving. Alan adds a wonderful personal touch that engages you immediately and you always feel a part of the group."
5,Great,"This is and likely will be the standard work on the Hellenistic Age for some time. It is a very well written book that covers nearly every aspect of an age that has more than its share of problems in trying to reconstruct. The book is huge, and when attempting to read it cover to cover many will think there is too much information inside. Professor Green is one of the better authors on ancient Greek history because he writes his books very objectively. That is no different here, as he does not try to gloss over the details of some of the less savory issues of this time, such as the incest prevalent in the court of Ptolemaic Egypt, in an effort to try to make Hellenistic society ""ideal"". Highly recommended for anyone looking to read a very detailed and very balanced account of the Greek world after Alexander."
4,Good Book,"From Alexander to Actium is in many ways a remarkable book. It is normal for historians to fall in love with their time and to present their subject as important or of particualar worth. This book is unusual in that the writer is aware of the weaknesses of Greek Culture in the successor kingdoms. The fact that manual work and commerce were frowned upon, the lack of development of science, the represive nature of the Greek Monarchies and the lack of any conception of government being for the broad welfare of the subjects. Yet at the same time he has an interest in his subject which makes the book readable and ineresting.Tom Munro"
5,The Definitive Work,"This is the definitive work on the Hellinistic Age, one of the most rich and fascinating ages, if not THE most fascinating age, in all of human history. This book covers all aspects of the period: political and military, the great cities and their cultures, theempires and dynasties which fought for dominance after the death of Alexander, the artistic and philosophical heritage of the times, the rapid ascendency of Rome, and a great deal more.This is the kind of work which anyone with an interest in history can pick up, open to any page or chapter, and discover a wealth of exotic characters and settings.My only criticism is the lack of color photographs to help illustrate this sumptuous period. Perhaps a later edition can correct this one failing."
2,Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Helleni,"Although this book contains much interesting information on the hellenistic age, I think it has several flaws. First, it contains too many subjective opinions to be properly 'scientific'. Second, Green's sarcasms are often so biting and his views so negative, that it is likely to kill the lay persons' fascination for the subject. Furthermore, his views on art and architecture is often at variance with most authorities. A case in point is the Laocoon, which in Green's opinion is a dreary piece of art. Great artists such as Michelangelo and Rubens clearly did not share this view. I am not saying that it is not allowed to share a few personal opinions in such a vast book, but in this case it clearly diminishes the value of the text for both the professional historian and the lay person."
1,GREECE EXIST SINCE 1850 A.C.,that lies that alexander is greek ? well he is macedonian and macedonia was never helenic ! after all ALEKSANDAR MAKEDONSKI (alexandar the macedonian - is how he was known)
1,Clinique Soft Finish Makeup 04 Soft Porcelain,"I purchased this item from Amazon when the department store was out of same. I had used this product for many years and loved same. However, this product is no longer being made by Clinique and was clumpy and lumpy and obviously old and stale, and out-of-date. It should no longer be available on Amazon. I should have returned same as it was not useable."
1,Not the same product,This has been my makeup for 20 years and has been discontinued. The product received had small lumps throughout and an odd smell. I'm unable to use this makeup.
5,The New Dumb & Dumber - Hilarious!,This movie is hilarious! I reminds me a lot of the first Dumb & Dumber (the sequel to D&D was mediocre at best). I rented this and Role Models and I have to say I was extremely disappointed in Role Models... Just wasn't laugh-out-loud funny like Step Brothers. This one is definitely worth buying to add to your collection.
5,Best comedy in years,"Love this film, can totally relate to it as it brings back many fond and funny childhood memories. Both Will and John are amazing - flawless performances. It's a guys film so I can understand why the girls might not enjoy it as much. Highly recommended nonetheless."
2,Started out with promise and,"completely bottomed out with the humor. From amusing to just plain dumb. Both actors have so much potential and this film also had potential. I hate when I see a movie and know it could have been so much more, if additional effort had been poured into it."
3,Good for a few laughs,"I think Will Ferrell is a comedy genius, he gives his all to comedy and i appreciate that in an artist. This movie is great fun from the start, the lines are well-written and delivered in classic Ferrell style but the movie slows down half way and then seems to drag itself to the end. It is definitely good for a few laughs but i only wished they could have carried it out all way through to the end."
1,Dumbest Movie EVER! (where's the -1 star?),"That was the stupidest movie I have EVER seen in my ENTIRE life! I'm actually dumber for having watched it. In fact, I think my wife's womb is now barren having stayed awake through that debacle of a movie. I may sue!"
1,Crude is not the problem...,"I liked Superbad and Knocked Up, loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall, 40-Year-Old Virgin was okay, Talladega Nights was funny...so the fact that Step Brothers is crude is not the problem I have with it. And the fact that it is dumb is not the big issue either. There is just not one single character to like in this movie. They are all selfish jerks and/or selfish idiots. The parents were stupid, unlike Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw in Failure to Launch which was tonally quite different but had the same grown-man-who-won't-move-out thing going on... For what it's worth I couldn't sit through Anchorman but thought Blades of Glory was kind of funny. If your likes and dislikes match mine, then Step Brothers is one to skip."
1,Poor movie in every sense,"How can anyone give this movie a good review? It's crude, and the swearing makes it more horrible. This is one of the worst movie I've ever seen.Money wasted for me."
1,Painfully stupid,Stupid and insipid. Will Ferrell's shtick is growing very old and very predictable. 90 minutes of toilet humor and (very) foul language targeted for the male audience around the age of 15. You would need to work very hard to make a movie this moronic. It's junk like this which encapsulates the dysfunction in society today. A total waste of time and money. BnB Beatles Depot
1,Horrible from Start to Finish,"What was this, I could not believe how dumb and immature this movie was. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Worst!,This is the worst movie I have ever seen! The rated R version was bad enough and I do not see the point of the unrated! I wish I could get back the time I wasted watching this stupid movie!
5,Best comedy since Dumb and Dumber! Very pleasantly surprised!,"If you're a fan of Dumb and Dumber then you will absolutely fall in love with this movie! I think a big reason that I loved this movie was because I wasn't expecting much since most of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's more recent movies have been duds that weren't funny at all.Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly play two middle aged, borderline mentally retarded men, still living at home, who become step brothers. The both act like you would expect [...] jealous step brothers to act and it is hilarious."
1,Not unrated - very unsatisfied,"I absolutely love Step Brothers, but I paid for the unrated version and got the theatrical release. I'll think twice before ever using Amazon video again."
2,"Some Funny Moments, but a very Stupid Comedy.","Boat's n Hos! Okay, that was the highlight of the entire movie. Stick with Talladega Nights. More fun to watch and more funny than this being in what I call the Will Ferrell situation that needs to end already or I need to be drunk to find this funny."
2,Will Ferrel could do so much better.,"Expected so much better from this movie. Should have been a movie short on SNL or Letterman. Ferrell perhaps should take a break for a little while. He is one of the funniest people out there, but his latest movies have not matched his talent, or seems pushed out to theaters too fast. If you're a fan, no problem, you'll like this one, but for me I'm unimpressed. I laughed here and there, but this ain't no ""Something About Mary."" Too bad."
1,"Item was never purchased, went missing in the mail.","The item was never received by me after I had purchased it, either it was never sent, sent to the wrong address, or someone else had perhaps received it. But it had never come to me at all"
2,Very bad.,"To begin with I dislike Will Ferrell for a number of reasons. I disliked the plot of this movie because it was just too unbelievable. The over the top sexual themes, nudity, and constant language make this not a family film, though it tries to be. The ending is too storybook fake. Wouldn't watch again."
1,Awful!!!,"I usually like Will Ferrell, but this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Nothing likeable about EITHER of these annoying, juvenile, idiotic brothers. I don't think I have ever felt such contempt for a character in a comedy as these 2 bozos. The parents were trite and devoid of any personality. James Caan is a good dramatic actor, but as a comedic actor, he is just boring.Truthfully, I dont remember if I sat through the whole thing or not, because I blocked a lot of this movie out, it was so bad. Putrid!!!"
1,Unwatchable,"I love to laugh. I appreciate humor like the next guy and grew up watching the original SNL cast and the Blues Brothers etc. Elf is a good movie. This one stinks and is completely unwatchable--unless, of course, you think watching Will rub his balls on a drum set for several seconds is money well spent. You would think that with the resources available to Hollywood, they could actually make something worth 2 hours of a person's time. Not clever, not engaging, nothing redeeming. Just plain horrible."
1,Will Fails Once Again....,"Ever since Old School there hasnt been a Will Ferrell movie I could claim I enjoyed. Stranger then fiction, Semi-Pro, and now Step Brothers are just not funny and painful to sit through. Will made me laugh on SNL and he is a very funny man. But the disappointment I continue to get from his films is never ending. Sorting through the reviews on here where people claim they laughed from beginning to end is unbelieveable. What movie were you watching? Do you think a 2x4 to your own face is funny? There is a scene or two that I could muster a giggle at but to have someone claim they saw this in the theatre 3 times and they now own it on DVD is frightening on so many levels. Stay away from Step Brothers unless you want to encourage someone you dislike immensely to watch it. Tell them you saw it 3x in the theatre and you loved it."
1,Horrible Don't waste your money,This movie a is an insult to anybody's intelligence! It's vile disgusting stupid and extremely boring the worst movie I have ever seen. Go to the DMV and you'll be more entertained and come back feeling more accomplished then watching this piece of junk. If you buy it you WILL be sorry. Ted.
1,Not funny,This movie has about 2 funny moments. They are all in the previews. Don't waste your time.
4,Funny- But not for the prude's or younglings,I found this film incredibly entertaining and found myself laughing hysterically numerous times.GOOD-Dry humor-Slapstick humor-Ironic humor-Shock humorBad-Cliche' humor-Predictability-The sleepwalking scene was pretty terrible
4,"outrageous as expected, a tad bit shortfall in clever","We have the impeccable team effort of Will Ferrell and John C. Riley in a movie that has pretty much a no-fail premise: two overgrown, immmature men living with their parents are brought together when their parents marry. Though the awkard moments succeed and the playful, childish sort of humor seems to work, a lot of the script seems to lack the cleverness or newness i'd hope for. A lot of it seems like it was just an opportunity for Ferrell and Riley to get in their pajamas and screw around on screen. Because of that, the comedy can sometimes rely on being kind of crass and overly lewd. But all of this is not exactly a bad thing and the sort of exuberance it adds to the movie may make it partially a good thing. I give the movie 4 star, 5 for the amount of laughter in seeing the stepbrother duo act, 3 for the script and second half of the plot."
3,The characters are not the only case of arrested development,"When Dr. Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins) and Nancy Huff (Mary Steenbergen) fall in lust at a medical conference, they realize during the throes of passion they're the perfect couple when they both confess they have 40-year-old sons still at home. Marriage follows shortly and Dr. Doback wants to retire to sail around the world.What they hadn't reckoned on was their two sons, Dale Doback (John C. Reilly) and Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) do not get along initially. Then, when they discover they are so alike, they get along too well for awhile.The breakup's pretty much inevitable. The end may be, too. The humor's pretty juvenile and the characters are a little too over the top, but there is a good message here, too. You've got to hold your nose through some of it.Rebecca Kyle, December 2008"
4,Redneck Review,Acting: A+Action: CPlot: CEnding: BSex Scenes: SeveralLanguage: ExtremeViolence: A+ and alot of itWorth a rental or Purchase: A+Man this movie made me laugh. I will say this. IT IS NOT KID FRIENDLY.
2,"Okay, Had Some Laughs","I didn't really like this movie all that much. It's just two much weirdness for me. And its way two sex orientated. Many people do like this movie this though, I guess because of its humor. Even though it didn't ring my bell, I found myself laughing at some parts. The story is about two step brothers who go from worst enemies to best friends. And when their parents try to sell their house and kick them out, it's up to them to stop anyone who wants to buy it. And all their evil schemes just keep getting weirder and weirder."
1,"Not funny, boring and completely pointless","Saw this (dvd) today and I gotta be honest: It's one boring, stupid and pointless crap I had expected. Not worth a cent. It probably had 2-3 really funny moments and the end of the movie didn't make sense at all either. So boring, offensive and not-funny. Don't waste your money on this"
1,I never f*****g got it!!!!!,I never got this product from the seller and I tried contacting them twice and nothing hapenned. scam artists slobs!!!!
1,More toxic fumes from liberal Turdtown,"Decline and fall, indeed. Like the ancient Romans: ""The grotesque masquerading as originality.""How can any marginally sane person get up in the morning and say:""Today I'm going to be filmed by 35mm cameras and a crew of 100 urinating in a dirty toilet bowl with my co-star, with the director providing an full-screen insert shot of the yellow liquid swirling around.""Do you realize that Shakespeare actually wrote for the common people of his day?When will the federal government finally condemn the motion picture industry as a toxic waste hazard and shutter these damn studios once and for all?Shame on the entire crew of this trash, the corrupt movie business that puts this junk into the cultural mainstream, Hollywood in general, Will Ferrell in particular, and morons who actually find this putrid filth ""entertaining.""May this movie be shoveled into the bottom of a landfill."
2,Way too long!,"I don't think I could rate this movie near worst ever, but much closer to that than a top ten. There are several humorous parts, but not enough, close enough, to make the plot engaging. The secondary cast had more redemptive value than the two brothers, which is not saying much. I do agree with some that the explicit language was not necessary as much as it was used, and the drum scene would have been just as effective shot from the backside. As other reviewers have said, you keep hoping it gets better, but it just doesn't. Comedies are not meant to drag on, but this does. I wish I could give Ferrell and Reilly at least a 3-star, but this just doesn't cut it."
3,"Everyone go check out my review of the guy who mentions shakespeare on the next page, you'll enjoy it","See Title of my review oh and check out the movie, not so bad, definitely not Shakespeare."
1,disappointed,i purchased this movie like 3 weeks ago and have yet to receive it. i think it is ridicilous and i cant get anyone to respond to my e-mails.
1,A Total Waste of Time,"If you are brain-damaged, this is the movie for you! Who thought this would be funny? Ferrell and Reilly are a disgrace to movie making! There are some talented actors in this world; these two are not! I don't recommend this piece of celluloid crap to anyone!"
2,not as described,case was very damaged. exterior leaflet wrinkled and torn with old price tag partially still on case. this was suppose to be a gift but instead is just embarrassing
3,never watched it,"i ordered this dvd bc i lost it at the library, so i never got to watch it. maybe one day i will.."
3,to watch or not to watch,This movie was nonsense ten times over. Pretty funny in some parts and then just downright dumb in others. Depends on your mood whether you will like it or not.
3,Step Bros,"It's very funny, but somewhat crude - not something I would watch with my mother or with small children, but exactly what you expect from Reilly and Ferrell. The bloopers reel is a must-watch!"
3,"Funny Movie, Picture could be better ...","Overall this movie when I first saw it was pretty funny. Got this one as a gift on Blu Ray and wasn't blown away by the picture as i thought i would be.. (Wanted with Angelina Jolie has a way better picture if you want a real movie to compare it to!) ..Some scenes are very good (picture wise) but if your looking for a comedy that reminds you of being young and stupid or for that matter an adult with a kids mentality than this is a funny movie for you, but not one of the best Blu Rays out there is the draw back for quality ..."
3,"""Lumberjack!""","This movie was your the typical movies you get from these guys. The humor was crude, with little to no creativity behind it. The acting was great considering what the movie was about. To be honest if you didn't like any of the other movies this duo, or just will Farrel for that matter did, you will not like this movie. The only reason I gave it three stars is a did laph my face off on one or two parts of the movie."
1,Claims its the unrated version,This is not the unrated version it claims to be. I have seen the unrated version and this is the plain rated version.
4,Pablo Cruise?!,"There have been alot of depictions of male arrested development notably Pee-Wee Herman and the Chris Elliott character on TV's ""Get a Life"". ""Step Brothers"" doesn't break any comic ground but the laugh quotient here is pretty high even if it tends towards the vulgar and infantile. Credit stars Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly for mining this material for all it's worth. Ferrell has a spotty track record on screen but when teamed with Reilly he seems to get inspired. Not classic stuff but great Summertime low-think entertainment."
5,funny,"My family LOVES this movie. They have watched several times and laugh every time. It's not for me, but I don't have the same kind of humor."
4,"Hated It The First Time, Now I think it's hysterical.","Ah Step Brothers....this is one of those movies, for me at least, that really grows on you the more times you see it. I remember renting it once on DVD and thinking it was just another bad Will Ferrell movie. However, now that it's on pay cable daily I have found new appreciation for it. The movie on a whole is really funny, with some great comedic acting by Ferrell, Reilly, and whoever plays Ferrell's brother in the movie. Seriously one of the funniest Will Ferrell movies I've seen. It's not going to win any academy awards, but it's got enough funny and memorable scenes to be worth a purchase on here for a few bucks. Definitely check it out!"
2,Not pleased,"I bought this movie for my husband. I watched part of it with him. I honestly didn't find it funny or amusing, but he did. To me, it's ""stupid funny"" and I wouldn't have bought it for myself."
3,Parent ALERT!!!,"This is not an age appropriate movie for those under 17. I know it's common now to let younger kids watch R rated movies, but this really goes too far for teens and pre-teens. I'm a father of 2 girls 11 and 13 and I would NOT let them watch this film. The crude sarcastic juvenile humor is mildly amusing for adults, but keep the kids away."
2,Foul Foul Foul,The concept of this movie had such potential - but was downplayed by the crude sex humor and throw-away scenes (sleep walking). I got as a present for my 14 year old son and was disappointed. Don't recommend unless you're in a college dorm.
2,No thanks,Too silly for my tastes. I watched it for about five minutes and turned it off. Sometimes I really like Will Ferrel's work but not this time. MY GRADE: D minus.
1,lamest,this movie is lame at times annoying poor plot. the acting is usually poor. you may laugh yet more likely you will forget to as you're wondering why you wasted your time.
1,i want my two hours back,"this is the worse movie with Will Farrell. The plot goes nowhere and is disjointed. And the whole movie is unnecessarily crude. Hey, I usefully like that kind of humor as long as there is a point to it and it's not just done for shock value."
4,movie purchase,I got it for my grandson & he was excited to get it I'm sure he loved it as it was something on his list.
3,Step Brothers Blu Ray,"The only problem I had with this was that my Blu Ray player wouldn't play the disc, which is a pretty big problem since I don't buy Blu Ray's to use as coasters. Other than that the movie is hilarious"
3,interesteing,I usually hate Will Ferell i think his acting is atrocious however this film is hilarious because the whole concept is based around two forty something year old men who live with their parents then end up living together when their parents get married it is in my library of movie's and i do occasionally watch it.
3,Delayed Maturity,"A silly, but amusing film. Fans of Ferrell and Reilly will probably be more forgiving than the average viewer, who might find it hard to relate to two fully mature adult males acting like a couple of spoiled, pampered preteens. Well acted, but one wonders why any producer bothered. Surely these fine actors could have found a better storyline."
1,Warning kills brain cells,This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's about two 40 year old brats and their enabling parents. It is very painful and frustrating to watch.
1,DISCUSTING AND STUPID,"I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW STUPID AND DISCUSTING THIS MOVIE WAS, AND I WATCHED LESS THAN 15MIN OF IT.I AM NO PRUDE, BUT THIS WAS WAY PASSED....TOO MUCHWAY TOO STUPID, DOES NOT MAKE FOR FUNNY.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS FILTH.!!!!THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT ONE STAR, BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD LEAVE A COMMENT....OR IT WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE GOT THAT.!!"
2,A CD with more sincerity than true passion,"This CD is neither horrible nor sublime. Just...OK. Mediocre. It's competent, but it has no lasting hold. The listenere coming to this CD looking for a great jazz CD will be sorely disappointed. Naylor obviously has a wonderful voice, smoky and sultry, and the musicianship throughout is quite good. And yet, there's something a little soulless about it all. The lyrics, while intending to be heartfelt and confessional, sound not unlike the heartfelt confessions of someone else--Sarah McLaughlin, Toni Childs, Jane Siberry, even Joni Mitchell. Nothing truly insightful or distinctive, beyond that wonderful voice. Which is a shame, because there's nothing ""wrong"" here, but it all ends up as so much melancholy cotton candy.I do think it's telling that the vast majority of the reviews below begin with raves about her live performances. Perhaps that's the way to see Naylor, with a drink in hand and a freshly broken heart."
2,Are you superstitious?,"Made in CAN in 2001, Serial# 06076-86314-2, Playing Time 36:42Album #13 for the boys... When I was in high school, math was one of my strengths, but I can't figure this one out:Premise 1: I like .38 SPECIALPremise 2: This CD is from .38 SPECIALConclusion: I DON'T like this .38 SPECIAL CD!Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against Christmas music (I've got about 20 CDs of it!), but this CD lacks what CDs like ""Merry Axemas"" presented: originality, and perhaps more importantly, creative interpretations.""Wild-Eyed Christmas Night"" combines 6 ""covers"" and 4 ""originals"", and the quality of the former, especially ""Jingle Bell Rock"" and ""O Holy Night"" far exceed that of the latter (especially ""That Old Rockin Chair"".)As a follow-up to the ""Live At Sturgis"" album, this one falls short of delivering the goods and the usual enthusiasm that makes .38 SPECIAL well, special.Their discography deserves the same fate as floors in a building: skip #13!"
3,not what I expected,"THE WEEPING BUDDHA came out of a real life disappearance that the author experienced when she was twenty-three. She has developed a criminal thriller with much research and familiarity. I could sense being there whether in lower Manhattan or Sag Harbor, Long Island. You can see that she has taken the time to create characters and situations that will guide the reader to try and figure out the resolution. But some of the story seemed to be lost in its own pages and the ending a little too contrived."
4,Gives Perspective,"This book was truly a great guide in giving some ""out-of-the-cubicle"" perspective...which, I believe, is something ANYBODY could use--even those who are, indeed, going right into working. It works in how it makes out the point of ***enjoying life while there are still (relatively) few responsibilities***."
2,Didn't reflect reality,"I skimmed through this little book, looking for ideas, and found plenty, but most of them would either not appeal to a young person of character, or would only be attainable by someone Independently wealthy, imo.On the positive side, a lot of contact sites are offered. Those, however, are available free online."
5,WHEN ONE WANTS TO STEP OUTSIDE THE BOX,"The Renaissance Soul: Life Design for People with Too Many Passions to Pick Just OneLearning new things is great but going straight from classroom to career choice just leaves out too many interesting experiences. Delaying the Real World is perfect if you want some stops in between, especially if you prefer variety and combination to choosing just one thing."
2,Not so great,"While the author does share some good resources and helpful hints, there was nothing eye-opening about this book. Basically it's just some advice from young people who share their stories and tidbits on venturing out on your own.It gives many motivational first hand account ""stories"" told by various twenty-something year olds of experiences they've had abroad or in a new city.Based on their ""voices"", positions they are in,(desirable internships, research grants, etc.) most of them seem to come from priviledged backgrounds as does the author, (it seemed she didn't venture too far from home for the interviews!) so this advice is slightly biased.The tone of the book is cheerleader like designed to rally the confidence of the reader and while, yes, it is positive and possibly encouraging I found it to be a bit on the overly optimistic side as well as slightly pretentious."
5,I call it my bible,I was searching around Amazon.com a while back for something that would maybe inspire me a little to do something out of the ordinary when I graduate college. Little did I know how amazing and mind blowing this book would be. I call it my bible. I already have about 20 bookmarks in it. Basically it inspires the heck out of you by telling you anything is possible and you can do and go anywhere in the world no matter how much money or who you are. And then it tells you exactly how to go about doing it. I would definitely spend the dollars for this.
1,never bother with a Partow,"Unfortunately, Donna Partow was recommended reading at our bible study--what a waste of time"
5,AMAZING!!,This study is one that I continue to go through over and over with other ladies as they come to the Lord and struggle with their path in their journey. I continue to be awed by God and how He has used this book over and over in the lives of women around me. Thank you Donna for being a vessel God has used in my life and in the lives of many other Godly women!
1,Atrocious,"The worst rendition of this play I have ever seen . The acting is atrocious . If I ever had a purchase to take back , this would be it !"
1,What were they THINKING????,"This was the worst version of Jesus Christ Superstar I have ever seen!The singing (especially Judas) was HORRIBLE! And the staging was awful. I can't believe Andrew Lloyd Webber actually approved of this whole project. Im so disappointed in it and Im sorry I wasted my money.I was about to turn it off, but I watched all of it in hopes that it would get better, but it didn't. I should've have just bought the movie version.I actually didn't even want to rate this one star, but I couldnt leave it blank. I'll give it one star just for the hanging of Judas, because it put us out of out misery for a few songs."
2,GREAT SCORE! TOO MANY FLAWS,"If you haven't heard of Jesus Christ Superstar Buy the CD (see the lists they tell the truth) then the movie this one is only for true JCS fans whom can hear past Jerome Pradón screaming & screaching through all the songs. I sounded as if he was siging falsetto up to Alto He has a limited range. Glen Carter was awesome but came up short in the falsetto Ted Nealy was 100 times better at falsetto When Ted did it, it was strong and confident. But Glen's falsetto seemed to fade and was unsure in Gethseneme. Fred Johnsson was a great singer AWFUL actor! Herod sucks big time! Annas is perfect! Ciaphas shouldn't have raised his voice (Peter Gallagher is a better Bass)1973 BETTER SINGING NOT AS GOOD ACTING2000 AWFUL ACTING BETTER SINGING1973's Singing + 2000's acting = London cast from 1972(I'm 13 but I heard it from my mom)"
2,Homosexual Jesus???,"What on Earth did the director do with the characters???? Great staging, costuming, updating, and fantastic vocal performances can't possibly compensate for the homosexual like interaction of Jesus and the apostles. Either the woman director has an agenda she's pushing, or she simply has no idea about the way men relate and interact with each other. One can't watch the scenes between Judas and Jesus without believing the two are 'breaking up'... It's simply painful to watch.The priests and guards are totally cool, Pilate is great, Simon Zealots is a tremendous improvement over anything done before, but... Jesus STILL ISN'T GAY - and shouldn't act like it!!The play LOOKS great, but because Jesus interacts with the disciples like he's dating them, it destroys everything else in the musical."
5,overwhelmed,"I was an adult when this show first materialized. I have seen it on stage many times. I loved the visuals of the film. This, however is the first time I have been moved to tears by this vehicle. I simply can not take any individual piece of this apart it is a whole and it is wonderful. Of all the work that Webber & Rice have done this will last the longest as I have seen in this production that what ever else may be done the story will forever be vital. I greatly appreciated the emphasis on the lyric and the downplay of the music. It has been put where it belongs, as an underscore of what it being said and done. I have read some reviews that felt Jesus was weak, I for one got far more out of his eyes than ever before, I also liked the fact that the man could sing, falsetto and in full chest voice. Judas is incredible, Mary sang her pieces in character and not as a ""STAR"" turn. On the whole very emotional piece."
4,I own both versions and saw the 2000 Broadway production,"...and I think it would be difficult to compare the two! The older version was not filmed on a sound stage and the shots were bigger, and reflected the preferences of the time. Both are excellent films, but are different interpretations of the same work.Glenn Carter does a great job, and although I really preferred Tony Vincent as Judas, Pradon does a good job portraying a complex character. In the end, I think I prefer the more recent version...Carter's Jesus is less ascetic, less angelic and much more human. I think that the newer version will reach the younger audience, the feel is definitely more edgy, urban and somehow more intimate."
2,Tragically over the top.,"Andrew Lloyd Webber has always subscribed to the philosophy that bigger is better. This 2001 made for television production certainly is bigger. Unfortunately, Webber, the cast and the crew seemed to have put quality on the back burner in favor of sheer volume. The result is something similar to shiny plastic; colorful, gleaming and fake."
2,"It's good, but it's not great!","Having seen the newest stage show in London with Glenn Carter in the title role, I was expecting great things from this video. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. Carter's voice is truly magnificent, and the music is as strong as ever, but the supporting cast, I feel, rather let the side down. The set is a bit amateurish looking,the cast devoid of emotion and passion(except for Glenn) and Pilate? What's he all about? He constantly sounded like he had severe digestive problems, and really spoilt the whole thing for me. As I said, the music is as emotive as ever, but for the real essence of the power of the songs and score, go for the vastly superior movie version."
5,glenn carter is perfect,"i cannot say enough good things about this film. it is simply perfect. glenn carter is absolutely riveting -- his gethsemane gives me chills every time. what a voice!! i can't get it out of my head. but the entire cast is excellent, down to the chorus. staging is paced just right, and costumes and sets updated for the new millenium -- will appeal to every generation. my 3 kids have it practically memorized. if you've never seen this show, get this tape. it has it all."
1,preferred the 70s,"I'm sorry I may be the minority who preferred the 70s version, maybe I'm getting old and sentimental. To me, the singing seems jarring and over acting, especially ""see my tongue I can hardly talk"", and the Gothic makeup weren't to my liking. And a blue-eyed Jesus ? I know this is acting, but at least infuse some reality for believers of the Christian faith. Thanks."
1,Sad effort - needs a 0 star rating - none available!,"A ""remake"" of an almost-as-bad 1973 movie. This version updates the story to a ""modern"" setting. Hmmm, and this was necessary to...? The fact that this version didn't last long on B-Way should tell you all you need to know. Hey, maybe Brittney Spears should remake ""Revolver"" to bring it into a ""Modern"" setting.Here's my suggestion, buy the original 1970 JCS on CD. Sit back and LISTEN to a superb work and a credible (accurate? I have no idea) retelling of the last days of Christ. The ORIGINAL was fantastic. Both movie versions are sad, this latest one is beyond sad..."
4,Stunning Performance,"This is a wonderful version with very powerful imagery and actors with exceptional voices. This contemporary version of the Gospel of Matthew really uses the scenery and costumes to bring to life all of the passion, both good and bad of mankind. I think this is a wonderful version to share with teens and adults will really appreciate all of the nuances perhaps lost on younger folk. The use of Gestapo and Roman soldier garb combined really allows the viewer to appreciate how oppressed a conquered people feel. The personal struggle of Pilot, real or imagined is amazing and Jesus, Judas and Mary Magdalene are powerful performances. The scenery and satire do not over power the wonderful message of this film. It is excellent."
3,Good...not great,"I don't really care for the older version of this musical or the new one. Both seem to have too much of whatever the time they were filmed look to them. In the newer version though I thought the person who played Mary was brilliant. She has a stunning voice and is so good. The diciples are all awesome and some of the numbers in this moving are amazing. Simon's Zelatos, Everything's Alright, I don't Know How to Love Him, and Hosanna are all so unbelievable. My personal favorite is Could We Start Again Please. That song is so pretty and I would recommend this version of it because it's better than the older one, though it could have been a little better."
4,Great acting except Jesus,"Jerome Pradon's Judas may not be the best choice for singing, but for raw emotion I have not seen his equal. I get completely drawn into his story. Jerome Pradon's voice may shake, but it does so with passion. He is amazing. You may not choose this version for audio, but for vidio, it's amazing. Sadly, the guy playing Jesus doesn't seem to be able to act his way out of a wet paper bag until the very end of the movie, when Christ is dragging the cross and is then cruxified. At that point he seems to realize he's supposed to be acting and actually does a good job. The rest of the time, he wanders around the stage trying to look cute (I get the image of a puppy). I love the movie as a whole, and it's much more timeless than the 1973 version. Ultimately I WOULD recommend this to anyone interested in the story, and not just the music."
4,I love it!,"Being raised on Jesus Christ Superstar, I have to say that I was perfectly thrilled when this new version arrived. I am not thrilled with some of the high notes of Glenn Carter but he was a great actor. I did see the show live and was so impressed with the modern staging. Big difference from the desert version! I have only one complaint about this video- I wish it was filmed as one would have seen it live. I didn't like all the trick shots and some of the camera angles. Being a person who saw it live, I noticed some scenes were not included in the video. Overall, it was fantastic. By the way, the kids (both 6 years old) sing just about all the songs. Buy it!!"
1,Horrible,"This DVD is terrible and not worth watching. The characters lack passion and are unbelievable. I had to force myself to sit through it until I could not take it anymore. Don't waste your time with this one, watch the original again."
1,Painful viewing,"This is the worst adaptation of this musical -- ever! This was my first experience with JCSS and after watching the video, I hated it -- vowed never to watch or listen to anything related to this musical ever again.The leads, although obviously talented, are not suited for the range needed to sing these songs. At times, listening to Pradon as Judas is just too painful for words. The only saving grace of this video version is the supporting cast -- Caiaphas: Frederick B Owens, Annas: Michael Shaeffer, Simon Zealotes: Tony Vincent, Peter: Cavin Cornwall .Avoid this at all costs. I was later introduced to the 1973 film version and fell in love with the story and the music. Ted Neely and Carl Anderon are wonderful and hit every note just right. Buy the 1973 version instead and save yourself a headache."
1,MAKES A MOCKERY OF OUR SAVIOR,THIS SAD MOVIE IS DANGAROUS IT IS A MOVIE THAT SEEMS TO BE A RELIGIOUS MOVIE BUT ALL THE WHILE TREATING CHRIST LIFE AS A SILLY MUSICAL STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE
3,"Good Music, direction, but bad features","Awesome music on this new cast recording! But, what's going on with Andrew Lloyd Weber's Productions in DVD? Although he's a millionaire, he should put a little more effort in his productions. The play is RECORDED, not filmed, and it gives a bad quality for the great music.Another thing that I don't like is Glenn Carter's performance. It's exagerated for a theatrical way of doing it, he uses a lot of body performance cliches, and it looks corny.Anyway, Jerome Pradon as Judas is incredible!! I liked him a lot! almost as Carl Anderson's Performance in the 70's movie.I didn't like the special features, though. I think they needed to be more specific as far as producion notes and interviews with the cast.But I keep all the good critics to the 70's movie, because for me is still the best of all times."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"Don't let the poor reviews of these theatre illetirate imbeciles affect your decision to rent this movie. To a trained theatre eye the technique and innovation of this show is emaculate. Judas executes his talent magnificently. His training at Cours Florent proves to be worthwile. Jesus show his ability in a more subtle way, playing the character to a tee.The set and costume design is one of a creative and contemporary edge. But I will say that you have to be able to have the ability to think logically and have an appreciation for theatre to thouroughly enjoy this movie.I say buy it!!"
1,Shouldn't have even tried...,"I'm sorry, but I can not agree with some of the reviews that I just read about this film. I grew up idolizing Ian Gillan's voice. Glenn Carter doesn't even come close. He uses a falsseto for many of the once famous power screams and F sharps that where so overwhelming. I know that there is only one Ian, but folks, a falsseto in leiu of a power scream is wrong. He shouldn't have even tried. I would have had more respect if he just sang it in his full voice and stayed within his range. The new scenery doesn't bother me. I can understand the artisitic approach, but if your expecting Jesus to come off like Ian Gillan or even Ted Neeley, you are going to be greatly disappointed."
3,Just a Medium Star,"Think: fusion Rent and JC Superstar, with bits of Cabaret and Les Mis thrown in. This updated version is edgy, techinical, and has moments of wonder. However, the overacting of several cast members and claustrophobic sets shadow this compelling musical and detract from the brilliance of the musical.As a fan of the original movie, I'll stick with that."
3,Very good.,I'd rather the sound in PCM 24 bits / 96 Khz.The performance is very good and the pictures are genial.Good
1,This book has no realworld value,"BJA2 has little value for the realworld player. The author goes into minute detail of cardcounting intricacies as if we're dealing with rocket science. No mention of the fact that casinos are adding to their cardcounter catching techniques almost daily. Any true advantage player knows cardcounting is the easiest of all edges for the house to recognize.Where is the mention of other, more profitable techniques? Sadly, nowhere in these pages. ""Playing The Pros Way""? I don't think so."
1,Attack Shooting Blanks,"I found this book to be completely lacking in any new ways to beat blackjack. Furthermore, the methods espoused by this book are well known to all casinos in the world and are very easy to spot. Furthermore, this book is dangerous for the novice player yet useless for the working pro."
5,Blackjack Attack is essential to serious players,"Schlesinger's book goes beyond the basics and lets you in on the real thing. It is written from the point of view of a real player who knows what it's like to win and to lose in the game of blackjack. Anyone who is serious about winning at blackjack needs to own this book, to read this book, to devour this book and to commit it to memory."
5,Thank you!,"Thank you for this fantastic book. Its great quality and speedy delivery, was very much appreciated."
2,Confusing Book,I was really confused reading this book because the author goes into too much detail. I couldn't figure out what was important or what was just information of interest. Is blackjack really this complicated that a whole book has to be written on it like this? It was way over my head and I think most people will find it dull and boring. Also the pages fell out as the binding wasn't very good. Maybe for professional players this is a good book but for gamblers even card counters it is just too confusing. The author isn't even a professional player but a Wall Street guy.
3,Not for the average player,I have to ask a question . Who are all these people who commented on this book? The author lists all these glowing comments but not one is attributed to a person. Is this ridiculous or what? He could have just written all these things to sell the book. The book itself is good but not great. It is overkill as far as I'm concerned. It should come with a warning that it is the trivia book of blackjack. I think a book like KO Blackjack is far superior because it teaches you how to win without getting a headache.
4,A classic,"This will be a classic book in the blackjack world just like Super/System is for poker.1) Yes the book goes into a lot of details, but this essentially proving his points. You don't want to blindly use the Illustrious 18 without knowing for sure that it is mathematically sound. I admit a lot of times the mathematical derivations get tedious but it's nice to know if you are industrious to use the methods for your own calculations.2) There is no counting system taught here; Don isn't a counting system producer. He is more of an player-analyst.3) For beginners, the stuff is probably way over your head. Otherwise chapters 10 and 11 are worth the book itself."
5,The best concert CD ever!,"You will never hear a better concert album than this one. ""Greatest Hits Live"" is a complete recording of all the Dramatics' Greatest Hits, LIVE in concert. The CD was recorded at a performance the guys did in Connecticut, and needless to say, it is spectacular. The voices of each and every group member are crystal clear, the whole concert is high energy, and the Dramatic Players (the Dramatics' live band) couldn't be better. There is not one thing I dislike about the CD."
3,wish song was longer,all the song was great but cut short and the sound effect was not good I think I got a bad copy
5,You're the Best Thing in My Life,"5+++++. These brothers are just baaaaaddd (in the good sense). The sound quality is excellent and they sound awesome. Every artist doesn't do a live CD well, but the Distinguishing Men of the Dramatics (as I like to call them), do it very very well and that Ron Banks........well anyway, this CD is a must have."
4,Shocking and saddening...,"Until I reviewed this book for my school booktalks, I had no idea that the Inuits were forced by the Canadian Gov't. into camps. This is a very interesting and informative read that most young adults will easily get ""into"". The reader is torn for Maata as one reads her life accounts....great for those who prefer the ""journal entry"" type of book."
2,OK if the AC is on!,"I used the nubra to wear with a halter style chiffon dress for a summer wedding. Since they are 'plasitcky' and don't breathe, my skin started to sweat under the cups in the august heat and they wouldn't stick-on! I REALLY did not want to go braless to the reception, but I drew even more unwanted attention to myself trying to wiggle and squirm to get them back in place every 5 minutes!I agree with the review who said they don't offer much in the way of 'lift'. They pulled the breasts together at the middle, but the profile effect was more of a 'cyclops boob' then attractive cleavage."
3,"ok, but runs really small","I am a size 34 B and a small 34 B at that. I sometimes wear A cups. However the B cup size from Nubra is sooo small on me, it barely covers my nipples. It kind of just looks like two heavy suction cups on the bottom of my breasts that drags them down.This bra might have given me cleavage if it was bigger but saggy cleavage. IF your breasts are not super perky I don't think this will do much for them unless your shirt or dress has some sort of ""shelf"" to sit your breasts on."
2,Mom of 3,"This is a great bra if you don't need any support. But I am 35 and have nursed three children, and even though I do not take a large cup size, this bra offered almost no support or lift."
4,Best bra I've worn yet,"Love this bra. I wasn't sure how well this would be for me because I'm pretty small framed but didn't want the featherlite models because I read they don't last as long. These worked out wonderfully!Perfect under any outfit, you really don't even feel like you're wearing anything, and so far I haven't had any problems with it falling off or feeling loose (I've worn it about 10 times now). It stuck perfectly even after a whole night of dancing!Nubra, you've sold me... Good job.The only issue I have with it (and it's extremely minor) is that it takes a bit of experience to get them lined up properly, I wish there was some way to make it easier. It just takes some time adjusting it in different spots. I'm probably going to try the featherlite after this one wears out."
2,an ant stuck in my cup,"i ordered an original NuBra days ago and it arrived faster than i expected. however, when i opened the box, i saw a dead ant stuck in the adhesive layer of its left cup. sooooooo disgusting! i need to wear it soon so i tried to removed that thing by myself (instead of contacting the seller and asking for replacement). this is my first time dealing with NuBra, apparently i didn't know how sticky it is... the ant got dissected so i had to use an eyebrow clamp to pick out the parts and eventually ""punctured"" my new bra. in conclusion, not a very pleasant first experience with online shopping and NuBra :("
5,Amazing!!!,"I love this CD!!! I've listened to it at least 20 times, even more than that!!! This is great music. The range from funny, to sad, to mysterious, keeps the listener intrigued for hours. If you liked the show, you'll LOVE this!! Listening to the music enhances the show... Make sure to visit my site for more about the show, ""The Mole"" at http://embark.to/mole and the music of the Mole! My only gripe about the CD is that there isn't more!!! :)"
5,Artisan Lace Charm,I got this for my daughter for a Christmas gift. It is beautiful and the picture does not do it justice.
4,"""Dad"" ain't bad!","I really thought this book was an interesting read. It is billed as a novel, but it isn't one in a coventional sense. It is hard to tell if there is even any fiction in it. There are moments in this book, lines, paragraphs that are wonderfully clever and profound. It is easy to read, but hard to understand. There is little flow to this book, and so all you have is the text, not any rhythm or expection of what will come next. If you expect to understand, you will probably be disappointed. If you expect to be amused and to look at literature in a new way, you should rather enjoy Dad Says He Saw You At The Mall."
4,A hard working farm kid maximizes his opportunities .,In this book a familiar character returns in Billy Baggs. He has discovered his great skill in baseball however he can't play on the city team. Together he and his mom decide to make flyers and bring kids in from around the countryside. For one night kids can play baseball with each other for fun. On one of theses nights the coach from the town team comes over and Billy challenges the town team to a game. Using skill and ability the town team is defeated by Billy's squad of country players. I enjoyed reading this novel and certainly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good sports novel.
5,READ THIS BOOK IT IS GREAT FOR MATURE READERS MALE AND FEMAL,"This book is really great, if you do not mind a few curse words here and there i would recomend it to anybody and everybody"
3,Good Mix of Farm Life and Baseball,"There is a little too much of the crude in this book for my taste - obscene gestures, mostly. There is also a bit of self-righteousness in getting even. Nonetheless, this is a sympathetic look at farm life and kids' aspirations. It is an up-to-date look at aspects of life that aren't usually presented to citified kids - a modern day dairy farm and, peripherally, the lives of migrant workers. Even the crudeness serves to make the book more realistic. The characters are well drawn and interesting - each with their own strengths and weaknesses."
5,Best Sand Ball to Date!,"This and the Wilson Official AVP Game Volleyball are your two best beach volleyballs, hands down. I bought this one and i love it. The colors are vibrant, and its got a great feel to it. The size is perfect, a little larger, which is prefered outdoors. I believe this is a bit smaller than the Wilson AVP.There is one hard spot i noticed warming up with this, and its around the valve stem. I think it just needed some breaking in, because once started playing with it, I never noticed, nor did anyone complain. I read and have purchased many other outdoor balls, and Mikasa wins this.Look no further!"
3,Could exercise better quality control,"I purchased two of these Mikasa balls for a vacation with friends, trusting the brand name and recommendations. One of the two balls, however, turned out to be leaking air off, which we discovered only at the beach and chose to keep playing (needed a second ball), rather than go through the hoops of returning to Amazon after the vacation. I was disappointed that even Mikasa apparently has such quality control problems, requiring us to inflate the ball every couple of days or so.Other than that - it's a great ball to enjoy for some decent volleyball."
3,"bEAUTIFUL, BUT NOT SOFT","This ball is beautiful, but not soft. When I startedto play my arms were red and I was feeling after 15 minutes using It.I was expecting It to be soft. I paid 63 dollars and It's like a cheaper ballthat coast 15 dollars.Shipping was great!"
4,"Good, but I prefer King of the Beach","Good versatile volleyball that is perfect if you encounter wet conditions often. This ball laughes at rain and pools. For my needs though, I prefer the King of the Beach because it is softer once it's worn in. Can't get that thing wet though, so it really comes down to the conditions you will play in."
1,Broke right after the warranty expired.,This is an extremely unreliable unit. After spending 400.00 the unit lasted only 4 months. The CD will not eject out of the unit and a message appears stating that there is no signal input. I talk to Audiovox and they stated that the unit has failed because of a Video and or software problem. Even though they acknowledge it is their problem they refuse to take care of it. This is now going to cost me an additional 160.00 to have it fixed. So unless you want an aggravating experience and want to spend a total of 560.00 for an unreliable unit I wouldn't waist your money on this.
2,not great,"I have had to take this player back twice. The power button broke and fell inside the machine, and the screen display is off center or discolored sometimes when I turn the machine on."
4,Not Bad,"I just got it so I can't say how it will last. But it's a nice unit. Nice picture and convenient. The speakers are not good, as other reviewers have mentioned, but they aren't terrible either. I am mostly disappointed that there isn't a built-in tuner for the TV when mobile. It works fine at home with a cable hook-up. It has a switch for TV and Cable TV. Why have the TV switch when there isn't a tuner? I have a call into Audiovox to see if they sell an add-on. I mostly bought it to watch TV and DVD's from a car but I like it enough as it to not return it."
3,Not good for remote area,"This TV/DVD player has a beautiful picture. It would be great if only needed for playing dvd's. But we were hoping to get tv reception for major network channels. We could not, even after buying a higher powered antenna for it. I returned the set."
1,Better hope something doesn't go wrong with it,"Bought this unit in Aug 2005 and unfortunately the screen developed a crack on it last year. Sent it in to Audiovox to repair (that appears the only way they repair items is if you mail to them), and their response was that since this is an older unit they no longer carry parts for it and my option was to buy a newer model. What kind of pathetic customer service is that, a company that doesn't support its products after less than 3 years!!I would recommend you steer clear of this item as they no longer will repair it, and perhaps steer clear of Audiovox if this is the type of support they offer."
1,DVD non-functioning,"Was X-mas gift 1 year ago, hardly used but already broken. Only used by adults in a spare room, never traveled with. I was concerned about reviews on a different site, but chanced it anyway... BIG MISTAKE! DVD function used less than 6 times, totally won't function at all now. Won't have TV picture after 2009 because not digital, so just an expensive piece of junk."
3,Great Reference Guide,"I am studying to be certified as a Family Life Educator. Along with the studies, this book will provide me with a reference guide to access whenever I need to refresh my knowledge. Great price too."
2,"Great Performance, Terrible Recording Quality",The wonderful performance could not redeem the awful recording quality. It seemed that the recording was done with a single microphone (poor balance) and suffered from distortion in many places. Even the most ardent Callas aficionado would not like this recording.
2,"Great Opera, Wonderful Singing, Terrible Sound",If EMI is going to release Operas that soundwise are well below their usual standards -- they should at the very least be in reasonably passible sound. That was true for their Callas Lisbon Recording of La Traviata. This one makes for very difficult listening. It is a CD for only the most diehard Callas fan.
2,"Great singing, but the sound is very poor","Andrea Chenier is mostly for the tenor, and del Monaco gives a great preformens here, but you can hardly hear him, since the sound is very, very poor.Callas is good, and sings ""la mamma morta"" very well here, but she is unable to do great things with the relativly uninteresting part of Maddalena.And the sound again: Very, very, very bad!I am a great fan of Callas (and del Monaco, in his best days), but I regret having spendt money on this one."
5,one album you need,"This is certainly a great new favorite of our family.Opened it, popped it into the CD player in our car, and its been there for two weeks.Great sound, pure tones, good selection of many different Christmas melodies.This is something we will certainly purchase for gift-giving.With three kids in school, there are lots of people to buy ""extra special"" gifts for.Thank you, Dianne."
3,Did the Vietnamese People Really Win?,"Morley Safer traveled back to Vietnam in 1989 to see how that country has changed in the fourteen years since the end of America's involvement in the war. Did the Vietnamese people really win? Morley's goverment provided guide, Ms. Mai, is assigned to escort and provide him access to the sites he reported from during the war. Ms. Mai envies the freedom that women in America have. All throughout the country it is apparent that the Vietnamese people still live with the scars of the war. It is an inescapable reality of their existence. Now, under communism, the Vietnamese people are worse off ... and it is made very clear in this book. Morley writes that the one thing many Vietnamese citizens resent the most is that they do not have the ability to hop on a Freedom Bird to escape the harsh realities of their daily existence. This book provides a fair perspective on what the Vietnamese people think of their victory."
4,Flashbacks: On Returning to Vietnam,"This is one of those books someone gives you for Christmas because you are a Vietnam veteran, and you digest it to see what it has in common with your experiences. While I was a helicopter pilot in the Delta, and nowhere near the places Morley visits in his periodic reporting forays, one gets the message of what anyone who frequented this tropical country eventually got. ""The place sort of grows on you,"" one journalist comments to another. That's what happened to all of us; we experienced the other side of the world as young men. This was an out-of-the-culture experience that only we knew we were certainly having--despite the efforts of our media, politicians, and college protesters to define it. Another book the Vietnam vet needs on his bookshelf to help sort out the morass this bureacratic farce was paid for in our military blood."
4,a thoughtful analysis of safer's coverage of the Vietnam war,"Morley Safer returns to Vietnam for a retrospective of the conflict; revisiting both north and south. This slim history provides a thoughtful look at the rationale for that action, and a cathartic opportunity for Safer to examine what he did as a young man."
5,An important work of journalism,This is a book which has affected me greatly both as a person who grew up in the Vietnam area and as a professional journalist. Safer succeeds in creating pictures of Vietnam which were never before filed. It is a crime that this book is not in print.
1,i love sly but this is garbage,"buy this only if you're a completist and you have to have it all. sly is a genius, and the dusty recesses of his post-family stone catalog can be rewarding -- even his misses are interesting. ""small talk"" and ""remember who you are"" are great. ""high on you"" has its moments. but ""heard ya missed me"" is truly awful. i love sly so much, i listen to this record about once a year, thinking it can't be as bad as i remember it being... but it is. and that $30 import price doesn't help either. consider yourself warned. ZERO STARS."
3,Sly Stone: Always ahead of the times,"This cd, although definitely not the best in the Sly/Family Stone discography, still has some shining moments in my opinion. The title track is one of the first to incorporate reggae into the music mainstream. ""Mother is a Hippie"" is a nice song for momma, and ""Let's Be Together"" is a tight disco groove.I like the ""STOP-DON'T, STOP-DON'T, STOP-DON'T STOP, STOP-DON'T STOP DON'T STOP!"" in the song's hook. It is a clever pre-90's seduction groove minus the R-rated language. Sly gives the listener the ecstasy of the moment without being as verbal and straight to the point as some of the songwriters of today's music.I really do miss ya Sly...Still waiting for one more blast!!!"
4,"Heard ya Missed Me, Well I'm Back",It was great to hear from one of the premier master funk musicians back doing his thing. Absent way to long! This C.D. has some really great musical moments. I'm glad I found it. A rare jewel!
2,Sly on the Ropes,"a Album that truly never gets off the Ground.While Sly Stone certainly knows how to craft songs this Set seemed like a Cat just going through the Motions really caring which way was up?""Blessing In Disguise"" is as close as you get to Up to Standard Sly Stone Material.a few things here&there work but overall it's 2nd&3rd tier Material that is only truly best served for Die-Hards.even though the ""Fresh"" Album had only come out 3 Years Prior to this Album it seemed more like 13 compared to the way the Material went down after a while."
4,It's a terrific book!,"This is a really good book which covers a lot of the prevalent issues in today's society (importance of beauty, alcoholism, etc...). I really liked it and I really wish that Asprin would write a heck of a lot faster. I'm waiting on tenterhooks for the next edition and I think my bookstore's getting tired of me always calling and asking them for a copy."
4,The middle book of a trilogy?,I love the series but if this is the last book I will be seriously disappointed. The story read like a prelude to more and than it ended. Let's get on with the rest
3,Don't buy this book,"Talk is silver, and silence is gold, but SCREAMING might just be the kick Asprin needs, to get on with it.I do not agree that this is a bad book, just a half one. Hence the 3 stars.I would strongly advice new readers to the MYTH series to hold back their purchases until a date for a sequel is set. But when the date is set, I'll personally make sure that everyone I know hears, about Skeeve and his companions.I think it is about time that Asprin continues, or hands it over to another author to carry on. Alternative the publisher should stop selling all the MYTH books, to save other innocent readers from buying this three-wheeled car.It is infuriating to get hooked like this, just to be let of the hook, in this way.BTW. There is no doubt in my mind that Gleep will live to wander the bazaar again. (I hope)"
2,Not Asprin's Best Work,"While this was absolutely refreshing after the previous volume, it still wasn't a great read. It was made up of about 80% people explaining things to Skeeve interspersed with the occasional scene of activity. I grew very tired of listening to people talk through their philosophies of life rather than seeing something move the plot forward. It honestly felt like you could read the first 30 pages, then the last 30 pages, and catch 99% of what's necessary for any real plot or character development. The rest is talking and internal agonizing.One more quick note: The frequent turning of Skeeve's naivete into a joke got tiresome. It was mildly amusing the first time, but not the third.Just not Asprin's best work."
3,I liked Skeeve better when he was a kid.,"I love the myth series, however the last several books have decrease in quality. I actually liked this book more than the previous 2 just because there were several hilarious scenes, (The blind date sequence is worth the price of the book.)I can see that Asprin is having Skeeve grow up, but one of the hallmarks of Skeeve as a character is that he is more powerful than he thinks he is and most importantly, he's likable. Skeeve is acting more and more like a jerk. Hopefully, this will correct itself in the next novel."
3,Screaming at him isn't going to get us anywhere!,"True, this is not up to Aspirin's previous works in the MYTH series, but I think that all of us fans should all remember that the only way we are going to get what we want (more _quality_ MYTH books) is to lay off and give the guy room to breathe. We should be more supportive instead of screaming that we're dissatisfied - whoever heard of psychological healing due to abuse? I want him to get better so I can find out what happens next, so LAY OFF!!!!!!!!!"
5,Became a mything person when I was 9,I picked up my first copy of Myth Adventur When I was 9 and never put it down. I think I read the whole set up to Sweet mythtrey of life 5 or 6 times. These books are great from cover to cover. If Anyone knows when Something myth Inc. is due out you have to E-mail me at Bluescape420@yahoo.com .ps. If you haven't read this book yet I have one word for you Gleep!
5,"Great, but where's the other one?","Oh, you just gotta love Skeeve. How does he go through life worrying day to day about ten situations, all at once? This book, like all others that Asprin has written, does have surprize ending that you can't figure out until the end. The only question in my mind is that he refers to another book that should settle and answer questions about the ending, but where is it?"
2,DON'T READ THIS BOOK UNTIL THERE IS A SEQUEL!,"I love the myth series. I really adore it. I have read every book. But Mr. Asprin needs to just close it up and stop adding on installments. This book lost the usual shine and bored me. It was also a clif-hanger ending, and the next book has still not come out yet five years later! In the first books you could read any one in any order and understand them, but in these they are all clifhangers and the jokes just aren't as funny. The whole main plotline of this book is Skeeve falling for Bunny. Oh boy. And it wouldn't be that bad except in the very end a bunch of crazy stuff happens and then it just stops. Like he was sick of writing it or something. I say if you want to read a myth book read Another fine Myth."
2,Worst book of the Myth Adventure series by far.,"This book has no point. The whole book is Skeeve trying to either fall in love or find out who he's in love with. There is no resolution. The only good part in the book is Skeeve's date with the vampire. Overall, lousy."
3,average,while in its entirety...its good....i love the book as all the others in the myth series...but.........big but....robert aspirin where are you? this needs to be followed up on! are you going to finish where you left off? sheesh! i love the books and am big fan please continue!
2,Get your butt in MOTION!!!!!!!!!,"I think that there is a trend going around. All my favorite sci-fi authors are turing into slugs. It the last few books Asprin has woooooshhh squelch... down the drain. But I am going to wait him out if it kills me. I'm still young and he isn't doddering yet. But if he kills off Gleep I'm going to get mad. Gleep that darling not-so-little dragon is one of the greatest charecters in the last few books. To sum it up, Hurry UP!!!!"
1,Nothing like on TV...,Very dissapointing. The inexpensive foam of the ball just disintigrates in certain rims.
2,A lot of work and not much to show for it!,"A lot of work and not much to show for it!I followed the instructions for cleaning my motorhomes wheels, but hand cleaning proved more effective than the fancy ball. Too bad ~"
5,"Brilliant ""Power Pop"" Song!","I think Parallel World is a great song, and truly deserves airplay. Both version are catchy and enjoyable, and any Squeeze fan should welcome this into their collection with open arms. However, ""By the Light of the Cash Machine"" is simply brilliant! It's infectiously catchy ""Power Pop"" that reminds me of Matthew Sweet, Split Enz / Crowded House and even some of Bob Mould's stuff. Fans of those artists will like this incredible song, I'd bank on it!If good looking people are ""eye candy"" then it's safe to say that great pop music - like the 3 tracks on this single - are ""ear candy"". Crank up the volume and sing along with the chorus, ""So I'll kiss you, by the light, of the cash machine"". Glenn Tilbrook has one of the most enchanting airy voices to ever carry a tune. I can't wait to hear the whole CD!"

5,The Re-Birth Of Pearl Jam .,Pearl Jam is ba-ack ! Riot Act has one of the best rock songs in there like I Am Mine .Guitar solos are Perfect and the somgs are so amazing .
2,"Another great album by Pearl Jam, one of the few bands that still stands up for the music.","Apart from ""The Manic Street Preachers"" and ""Supergrass"", ""Pearl Jam"" are one of the few artists who are making music for the sake of ""artisticness"".While many just don't get it, and think Eddie Vedder should sing like he did on other records and the band should pull out riffs and hooks, ""yes, that Rolling Stone review nailed it on the head, on the previous review"", the choruses fall into place in the song instead of doing the in the studio, in your face effect, genius!Overall, the stongest Pearl Jam album as whole, but ""Vitolagy"" and ""No Code"" would have to stand as the bands most accomplished artistic efforts."
3,PJ's back!,"Riot Act, pearl jam's 7th studio album, is finally out. Not including the some 70 odd number of live albums they've released it's been two years since they've made an album. The new single ""I am mine"" is probably the strongest song on Riot Act but others such as the rocker ""Save You"" and the mysterious love-ballad ""Love boat captian"" are likly singles. I gave this album 3 stars but more like 3.5 its a okay record but not their best."
5,A must buy!!!,This album is definitly worthy of the long waiting for all Pearl Jam fans. I can't take it off my CD player now! I would love to give 6 stars for it!
3,Nocodeyieldbinauralriotact,"All the great bands/artists of our days have gone through experimental periods of growth and artistry. So why does Pearl Jam resist the chance to stretch out and grow. There's certainly nothing wrong with Riot Act, however I get the feeling I'm listening to the same PJ record that I have been for the past 7 years. Its one thing to not change stylistically, but this record has the same dry ""anti-sonic"" sound going back to the sound of No Code. Is progression not in the Pearl Jam vocabulary?"
2,Disappointed,"Having been a Pearl Jam fan for years, I was disappointed with this CD. The songs on this CD seem to stray from the style of rock that made Pearl Jam a success. In addition, I felt it was a little too political. Pearl Jam should stay with what they do best."
5,Fantastic Album,"Riot Act should have won album of the year! Although listening to the album 4 years after it was originally released, I am so glad I got back into Pearl Jam. I have not listened to Pearl Jam since high school--I can't believe I deprived myself for so long! Pearl Jam is the best rock band of my generation. Hopefully, they will stick together and put out several more albums down the road. For those of you not sure if Pearl Jam still has it, trust me THEY DO!!! Buy this album, you will be in for a pleasant surprise..."
3,Not the best PJ album but still passable,This album is not in the class range of Ten or Binaural but it is still good. This release shows Pearl Jam experimenting with powerful chords and nearly grunge style beats. The Album Art is a tad perplexing and doesn't fit the tone of the music. Then the inside cover you have a scene of the band rehearsing in their studio. Ok....what's the common link here?Can't Keep and Save You are good songs and then the not so good songs come in at Cropduster and Climbing My Way. And I sure didn't understand Green Disease. The highlight of the album for me was the song 1/2 Full and the last song All or None.This album won't suit every Pearl Jam fan but it's still an alright listen.
4,True To Their Spirit,"I've never balked at any musician who follow their hearts. Pearl Jam's progression and direction may not please everyone and their later releases may not have the angst and aggression of ""10"", but people grow and Eddie and company have matured into brilliant (at times understated), craftsmen. I applaud the organic nature of their new work. It is reminiscent of the rock and roll roots they sprung from (Neil Young, The Band, et al.) You can FEEL these guys and you KNOW they can play the hell out of their instruments...a breath of fresh air."
5,Its Pearl Jam - what else can I say?,"As a die-hard Pearl Jam fan, I've been waiting in anticipation for this CD for months now and boy was it worth every second! I had already heard some of the songs (ie. Can't Keep & Thumbing My Way) from one of the previous concerts, but was surprised to hear how different they sound on the record.It's truly a great musical work ... but then again, I've thought that of every Pearl Jam song ever released. I'm certain that if you are a Jam head you wont be disappointed. If you aren't, don't expect the whole CD to be ""I am mine"" material or you will be very upset.5 STARS!"
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Pearl Jam proves once again that they are so far of everyone its not any funny. The songs on Riot Act are the best the band have ever written(with the exceptions being black and grievance). Songs like ""save you"" and ""ghost"" prove to all the critics that they can still rock with the best of them. Riot Act is a breath of musical fresh air in a time where bad rap and blink182 ripoffs are receivng credit that they dont deserve. And im not going to get started on the so called ""it"" bands-hives,strokes- three words- COMB YOUR HAIR. Anyway i am encouraging all of you to pick up this album if you are a pearl jam fan and if you are not a fan this will open your eyes."
3,Dissapointing without being dissapointing,"Pearl Jam have always been a band who bucked against popular opininion and the direction that they should take. This album is a continuation of their trend to give you a brief glimpse of what you want and then teasingly take it away again. Since the days of Ten when the band pumped out angry angst ridden grunge they have mellowed significantly with only the energy of the Yield album breaking the trend.Riot Act is in no way a bad album, its alo unfortunately in no way a great album, it treads the middle ground throughout. Theres nothing as anthemic as Alive, nothing as haunting as Indifference or as melodic as off he goes. However there is also nothing as bad as Bugs or Push Me Pull Me.Overall Pearl Jam may be guilty only of producing an average album, lets hope, that in a similar fashion to the way that the magnificent Yield followed the mediocre No Code, that the Pearl Jam album after Riot Act amazes us all."
3,SOME GOOD SONGS...,"RIOT ACT got some good songs like CAN'T KEEP, SAVE YOU, I AM MINE, GHOST and YOU ARE...but also got 3 or 4 songs that i don't care too much...In fact, for me this is the less inspired album recorded by PEARL JAM...Their previous albuns TEN, VS., NO CODE, YIELD and even BINAURAL are way better...but if you like PEARL JAM, you may like RIOT ACT too..."
4,A High Quality Record,"Pearl Jam is still making relevant music, period. They're not the same band they used to be, that is obvious, but why would you want them to be? I've never understood the, what I call, ""AC/DC Need."" The ""AC/DC Need"" is a music fans need for the bands they follow to stay the same. To stagnate and endlessly milk the niche they carved in the past. Pearl Jam is no AC/DC. They're ever evolving and challenging themselves to stay original. I commend them for their efforts, and their latest release, ""Riot Act,"" is one of their best albums to date."
4,Best Pearl Jam since Vs...,"I loved ten when it came out, and was a bit sceptical about Vs. when it came out, but loved it as well later. Hated Vitalogy when it came out, never really got to appreciate it. No Code, Yield, Binaural gave up on all of those on first listens. Then I hear the song called love boat captain and decide to check out Riot Act. Now THIS is a lot better than I've heard from PJ in the last few years.Starts off really catchy with ""Can't keep"", ""Save you"" is a nice rocker, and then comes the great ""Love boat captain"". the next songs are all okay, but then the album collapses with the terrible ""you are"" - a stupid industrial sounding song. ""Get right"" is terrible too. so are the next songs. Luckily. the end of the album is saved by the excellent 1/2 full and great closer All or None (i purposely skipped the filler track ""arc"").This album isnt exactly worth 4 stars, but a bit more than 3, so i wish i could give it 3,5 stars..."
3,I am a huge PJ fan and found this album disappointing,"I actually have liked the band's transition away from the louder Seattle grunge sound into more complex ballads and mellodies on No Code and Biannural. This album has a mix of old and new with no real outstanding examples of either form with the exception of all or none which is up there with all the PJ greats. Biannural,Yield, and No Code blow this album away. I hope this is not the beginning of a long decline for the band as they have given me so much enjoyment over the years. That said, 3 stars because even bad PJ is still not bad music."
3,Old Pearl Jam Fan,"Ten, VS, and Vitalogy are definetly their best. No Code is the cd that made me stop buying anything Pearl Jam, and buying Riot Act was my attempt to become the PJ fan that I once was. I didn't think this album was that great when I bought it, but I admit, it does grow on you.However, I believe that it has grown on me simply because I have grown up. I grew out of the hardcore alternative, and so did PJ. Sad, but true. The vocals do seem a little weary, but overall it's good music. Nothing on this cd will make me pause in the middle of a supermarket like ""Better Man"" or ""Elderly Woman behind a counter (etc)"" but I'm glad I bought it."
2,"Pearl Jam Fan, but this is no riot.","I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan, and was looking forward to this release. Unfortunately, it was a wait that was unfulfilling. Pearl Jam reminds us of their glory days on a few of the tracks (i.e I am Mine and Love Boat Captain). The majority, however, are overly moody and pensive (even for Eddie Vedder) and seem to disolve into no particular place. The album probably should have been called ""Side B"" or ""Look what I found in the bottom of this old guitar case"". One gets the feeling that the boys got together after being hassled by their record company to fulfill their contract, and spit out whatever permeated their beer soaked brains. This is obviously not their best work, and sadly may be their worst. I certainly hope it's not their last, because there is better music that can come from these talented musicians. It will be worth the wait if they choose to make it. This, however, is not it."
1,a waste of dough,"Thankfully I got this used, or I would've been mighty disaapointed at having paid full price for it. The reason why people like this is because they're PJ fans. I mean, that's the only explanation as to why such an uninteresting album seems to have gotten such rave reviews. I can sum up Riot Act in one letter: zzzzzzz."
2,Someone Stole This Cd,"Everytime a new Pearl Jam cd comes out I buy it, why? I think because in the early '90s they stood for so much. I wanted to like each cd, but disappointment is what I receive. So when someone stole this cd from me I have never missed it nor wanted to replace it. Hopefully thier new cd will rock but I will have to be sold on it before I buy it.No one can deny what a great cd Ten was, and I didn't want each cd to sound like it, I just wanted more of the feeling but each release was flat. I know their is legion of fans but you know exactly what I am talking about.I give this two stars because with each Pearl Jam cd their is one or two tracks that are good. Just have to fumble through all the cr4p on them, and for me I am just sick of it."
1,garbage!,"how did pearl jam ever think anybody would want to listen to this [stuff]? not a single track stands out from the wreckage of this album. vedder's voice has never sounded so incapable, nor have his lyrics ever been worse. a really sad comedown for what used to be a good band."
5,music just doesnt get much better than this album,"i was losing hope in albums around this time period/ but riot act really saved my hopes here/ pj proved that theyre still relevant and have given something for old school music lovers like me to cherish, bravo pearl jam/ songs are better live though"
5,"MUSICALLY, ITS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ALBUMS RELEASED","Since 2000...The music is very interesting, although lyrically & vocally, it's not one of Eddie's best.. the band is still experimenting, & now they even have a organ player..Takes a while to get into this one, wouldnt recommend it if you're new to Pearl Jam, get greatest hits first"
5,Never a Dull Moment,"Many other bands may sell more albums, but they don't really matter, do they? If you are void of substance in your musical catalog, you may want to try this album. You may not dig all the songs on the first listen, but the songs grow on you and provide satisfaction... This album has its fair share of rockers and ballads. ""Save You"" is in the mold of ""Do the Evolution"" ""Spin The Black Circle."" What I really look forward to is seeing these tunes performed in concert. Peace"
2,Pearl Jam crash and burn.,"Pearl Jam really need to put their riot back into their act. Their quality of output since hiring Matt Cameron on the drums has been abismal; it's a nice idea to introduce a more democratic structure to the band, giving the other band members the chance to write songs, but unfortunately the songs, particularly by Matt Cameron are terrible. The real song writing talent in the band has always been the Vedder/Gossard partnership. The cryptic and difficult songs that scatter this album really overshadow the few good songs (I am Mine, Save you). Pearl Jam were right on the money when they released their best album Yield, but since then they have failed to get the adronaline rushing."
5,Reviewers Miss the boat,"...The album is very down to earth. Both lyrically and musically the album is not just relevant, but cutting edge. Get your hands on it whatever way you can, listen to it, resist temptation to compare it to what's ""good"" according to your radio announcer. Then when you realize how amazing it is, just buy it. It's [X] well spent and you get some incredible artwork and a lyric book that actually took time and creativity to make. All in all an amazing album!"
2,no killer,"its ok to compare riot act to binaural because riot act sounds like all the tracks that slowed binaural down. with riot act, there is no stand out song. and no WELL WRITTEN rock songs or pop songs. i dont know why pearl jam even bothered releasing a single for this record, since there are no identifiable singles. that may work for some bands, like radiohead, but a rock record needs hooks, which are painfully absent from riot act. this just feels like an uninspired album. nothing new, just rehashed pearl jam filler."
2,A lifeless riot,"This is Pearl Jam in full on geezer rock mode complete with aged, uninspired riffs, cynical political lyrics, and an overall inescapable apathy within a once rocking exterior and sensitive interior."
2,Not bad but politics & music shouldnt mix,"I remember when Pearl Jam was one of the best grunge/alternative bands out there...I also remember when Pearl Jam was NOT a political band. Why do bands do this?? If you sing about politics, people that listen to your music arent going to make political decisions based upon your songs (if they dont agree with you already) and the people that have different views are going to stop listening to you. I KNOW EDDIE VEDDER IS A DEMOCRAT!! I DONT NEED TO BE REMINDED IN HIS MUSIC!! Why cant we just sing about human emotion and leave politics and religion for church and the white house? Incubus, Nothingface, System of a Down and MTV this means you too!!!.......grunge died with kurt and lane...(we will always have ""ten"" and we arent going to miss eddie's new propaganda garbage that goes out of style when times change)"
1,Terrible. One of the worst albums I have ever heard.,"This album just sucks so much. This album was when I stopped caring or listening to Pearl Jam, they just make garbage now. TEN was their only great album, after that they just sounded like whatever garbage was on the radio that year and they are still following the same formula. If you've heard any Backspacer tracks you will agree, hell if you have heard any Pearl Jam for the last 18 years you'll agree. Backspacer thus far is even worse than this horrid album. The Pearl Jam that hit the scene with TEN are long dead, now all we have is radio friendly, misguided, spitting on their grunge roots, mellow Eddie Veddar gong show epics."
1,Horrible,This is the worst CD Pearl Jam ever came out with. There are only 3 songs worth listening to. The other songs sound as if the band was playing one song and Eddy was singing another. The rips are too short and don't match the beat of the song. Can't believe that this is the same band!!
1,no good,this cd failed to live up to earlier Pearl Jam standards. I Am Mine was the only thing listenable.
3,So-So,"Not the best they've done for sure. Not to knock the guys, i'm a diehard fan, but come on where's EV vocals in this one. There isn't a single song on there that gives my the chills like so many other songs from the past. When asked to describe this CD to people that don't have it i always say, it's a good cd for drinking to. This one sounds a little routine. I do like ""Can't Keep"", ""Thumbing My Way"", ""You Are"", and Mike shines on ""1/2 Full"" and ""All or None"". I'm not too happy with this cd, but it doesn't matter because seeing them live is just unreal. The concerts are why I still listen to them. As with Tool, see them live and you'll see why they have that many fans."
4,Silent Riot,"Track Picks:-Can't Keep-Save You-Love Boat Captain-I Am Mine-You Are-All or NoneCould Have Done Without:-Ghost-Green Disease-ArcSingles From Album-I Am Mine-Save You-Love Boat Captain-Bu$hleaguerReview:Pearl Jam are still in the wilderness, and proud of it. They don't try to resurrect past successes, leading to a couple of uninspired songs, but their playing and production is getting better. There are no immediate hits, save for first single ""I Am Mine"". The rockers are very good, most notably ""Save You"", which has a great opening riff. The ballads are in full-force here, on the tender ""Love Boat Captain"" and heavy-hearted ""Thumbing My Way""."
2,Not their best work...,"I was let down by this one. It has a couple of decent tracks ... otherwise not that good. Sorry EV, still think you are cool."
2,The worst Pearl Jam album to date.,"How can anybody who likes Pearl Jam music actually like this album.Can't Keep is a good first track for the album, the rest is just really bland.Some of the songs sound like they have potential, but the songs are just really dull and boring.Eddie Vedders singing is shocking.The way the songs were performed on Binaural was apalling as well.To realise this all you have to do is compare there last two albums with the ones that came before that.The last Pearl Jam album that had good songs music on that was performed well was ""Yield."""
1,THIS CD STINKS WORSE THEN A 500 POUND MANS SWEATY UNDERWARE,Why can't this band wake Eddie up before they record his vocals. I've never heard a man sound so bored singing his own songs.After Yeild I was hoping they had gotten passed the No Code curse of boring me stupid but then came the last album that I won't even name cause it's so damn bad. Well too bad for me this follows the same road of mummbling garbage that has now become the PJ I once loved. If your gonna buy a PJ cd pick up Ten or Vrs. at least eddie was awake for those.
2,"oh, hum","Riot Act is about as good an example available to experience mediocre big time rock as you will find. The band is great, the music is great, but who is that guy moaning the lyrics into the microphone. Talk about pathetic............. Somebody please teach this guy to sing, actually sing."
4,Grunge is coming back!,"This may be there best work since Vitalogy. After Vitalogy Pearl Jam has gone downhill. Except for No Code I really liked that one but it is underrated. Alot of the songs sound great on Live On Two Legs. As for this CD I'm not sure, but I can assure you it is worth buying. The songs that I like on this album are ""Green Disease"", ""Get Right"", ""Thumbing My Way"", ""I Am Mine"" ""Save You"", & ""Ghost"". Those songs stand out the most and the rest are pretty much forgettable or boring. And don't buy this if your not open minded and are looking for another TEN because this is Vitalogy part 2 with the singles. If you are looking for another TEN try Vs. cuz that is the closest your ever gonna get."
2,"Hello? The early 90s called, it wants its grunge back!!","Forget creativity....WHERE'S THE GRUNGE!!With each record, these guys get closer and closer to REO Speedwagon. ""Love Boat Captain""? Sounds like a ballad for a Titanic movie made in the 70s.Whatever happened to PJ classics like ""Alive"" and ""Evenflow""? It seems they've fallen by the wayside, allowing more talented bands like Creed and Nickelback to take over the grunge title from Vedder.On the positive side, STP's new album should arrive soon.Let's get it back to what it used to be, guys.TAKE CARE!!"
3,"An improvement, but...","While this album is several steps up from the hideous mess of ""Binaural"" (it features actual *songs*, for example, rather than an entire disc of unfocused meandering) it's still hampered by the murky, indistinct production values that the band has suffered from to one extent or another since ""Vitalogy"": most of the time, most of the instruments sound like they were recorded with the speakers under a bale of cotton, particularly the drums and rhythm guitars. Overall, though, not bad, if you can get past the sound and focus on the songs themselves."
2,amazed listener,"I am amazed that this CD has gotten such good reviews. I have been a long-time listener of Pearl Jam, and have appreciated each stage of their career up to this point. I have been impressed by the consistent quality of their work, their ability to succeed with different styles of music, and certainly by the intelligent and challenging nature of their lyrics. This album has at least this last bit going for it--the songs are informed by a spiritual and social consciousness that is rare in rock these days. But the songs, from a musical standpoint (excepting three or four out of the thirteen), are just plain bad. I liken them to dirges that just weigh heavily on the listener--you keep hoping for some glimpse of melody, some redeemable thing that will make the song worthwhile, but are continually frustrated. I painfully listened to the CD three or four times, trying hard to appreciate it, but finally shelved it, where it will most likely stay for a long time."
5,FINALLY...BACK TO THEIR ROOTS!,"Unbelieveable, this is absolutely the best album they have recorded since Ten, it might even be better than Ten. This album will go down in rock 'n' roll history as a classic."
4,Best Pearl Jam album yet!!,"This album is fantastic, by far the best Pearl Jam album yet, thank goodness its not another TEN! - everyone!!Thats the last thing Pearl Jam want to make."
5,Pearl Jam continues to quietly amaze the masses,"Pearl Jam's Riot Act is a nice blend of good old rock and roll. Although 2000's Binaural was good, it was by far not their best work. It was missing an edge, which Riot Act provides effortlessly. I read about critics asking for a Pearl Jam masterpiece, and that sounds so ridiculous. Just look at the entire Pearl Jam catalog, and they collectively ARE a masterpiece. They are the most consistent band I have ever heard. They write the music they want, and say f--- you to anyone who doesn't like it. Riot Act is great from beginning to end with ""Save You"",""Love Boat Captain"", ""Cropduster"", ""I Am Mine"",and ""Get Right"" as my favorites. If you are a true Pearl Jam fan, like myself, this is a must buy. But if you are a chump and you only like their debut, Ten, then don't waste your time. To Pearl Jam, keep making great music."
4,Riot Act Rocks Old School,"...This has been a long time coming, and it rocks pretty hard. Pearl Jam has been off the radar for a while now, and ""Riot Act"" is a killer return...The new material is pretty impressive...The album has melodies in it that are more complex than previous Pearl Jam efforts. There is something very profound in this.This record has a great feel. Pearl Jam could easily make status quo, but instead, they try to make something they haven't made before...There is something about this band that gives them a timeless quality. Perhaps it is the fact that there is no urgency to produce. They have been in the light, they have been in the dark. They know their fan base. In ""Riot Act,"" they create a new piece of brilliant work that should be on every alt-rock fan's CD shelf."
1,Cheap Shot,"I WAS a huge PJ fan, heck I collect b-sides, imports and anything I could get my hands on. While I still enjoy their older music I can not respect political cheapshots. Case in Point: Bushleaguer , come on, seriously have you completely run out of ideas. I know that they are bleeding heart liberals/socialists but could you inject some intelligence into your songs/lyrics. Why not a song called ClintonDecay about the moral decay of our society? I do listen to bands that don't follow my politcal leanings, i.e. SOAD. Their song BYOB is obviously about the Iraq war but they pen it smartly. They don't say ""Why don't Bush,etc. fight the war?"" instead they say ""Why don't presidents fight the war?"" which makes a political statement, however, it is not dated and sophmoric; heck they could be talking about the Civil War and Lincoln."
1,Throw in the Towel already,"Pearl Jam just keeps falling&falling with each release it seems.this Album lacks a real knockout track&the Playing seems like going in routine.the only thing that has changed with Pearl Jam is there Hairstyles.Pearl Jam is mainly a Band that had a few moments&a bunch of clone acts like Stone temple Pilot,Creed,KnickleBack,etc... keeping there sound&Vocal stylings around.but all I hear here is another Band doing a formula round."
1,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNNN,"What a disappointment. Yes, Ed Vedder's patented warble is strong as ever but hints at how good the glory days of the mid-90's were for this seminal band. Now it seems all the good tunes are being done by bands aping the PJ style while the originals are content to bore everyone else to tears with uninspired garbage like RIOT ACT. I couldn't wait for it to end. And to think, this from a band whose singer last great work was with the late, great Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (Dead Man Walking strk). The record label must be counting the albums left on their contract so as to be rid of them. Pearl Jam is to rock what Prince was to funk/soul - dismal failures as the years went on."
3,Flat act,"I am still waiting for Pearl Jam to release a GREAT album.If it wasn't for TEN, I would probably never have bought a PJ album.Not that I would like something that sounds like Ten, but something that has the intensity, the energy of their first effort.I don't think they have written a song since that first album, to me all the other albums they released since then sound the same, not bad not good, just flat almost has if PJ was afraid to take a step forward and reconsider their music.I had great hopes when Matt Cameron joined the band, I really though he would destructurize the beats, break the monotony, bring a new dimension to the music-like he did so well in Soundgarden...Nooops!But then again why would they if almost everybody gives them a 5 stars.I just think that they have a lot more to give than they do."
4,This will surprise you,"As Pearl Jam settles into a more low-key career than they had in the grunge heyday, they continue to turn out high quality albums. No big hits off this one but lots of should have beens. This terrific record rocks, one of their best."
2,Bad Album From A Good Band,"I cant imagine anyone who is not the most loyal,die-hard Pearl Jam fan liking this album.Riot Act is the bands weakest album-tired riffs and vocals and unfocused lyrics throughout.In my opinion,Pearl Jam tried to go for a warts and all,raw,unproduced feel.But the songs just sound sloppy without the hooks,Vedder sounds tired without the soaring choruses.And lyrics written by too many people in the band to have one singular vision.If you want to buy a great Pearl Jam album that isnt Ten,I would suggest 1998's Yield.Delicous riffs,atmospheric vibes and Vedder at top of his game as a singer.Great rockers and even better ballads make that album a 5.Riot Act is a 2."
5,simply amazing,"I'm in no way a blues/bluegrass fan, whatsoever. But I was borrowing my friends car for the weekend, and clarence bucaro's cd was in the player. It's very soothing. I especially like Sweet Laurel. The vocals are amazing. Such a talented young guy. And very cute! (check out his website). So I definatly recommend this cd for anyone that just wants to relax and enjoy some good guitar riffs and soothing vocals."
5,Colt: An American Legend,"Made a great gift for my Fathers Birthday, he's a collector of firearms, we live in Australia, books of this type are very hard to come by. Amazon made the purchase very easy, I'll be back!"
3,Seeing double,"This is exactly the same as the colt heritage. Word for word, chapter for chapter. A few more pictures. If you own colt heritage you don't need this book. You do need one or the other if your interested in colts or just like looking a pictures of fancy old guns.Personally I like the real ugly colts that were actually used."
5,Not enough reviews of this incredible album,"There are three (3) releases of this album thus far. I own the original Red Stream 1996 release with 7 tracks. It is readily available everywhere. If you type in Bethlehem Dictius Te Necare in the search bar you will find an MP3 download version that has the album cover of the 2009 digipak re-release by Red Stream which has been remastered beautifully and has two bonus rehearsal tracks from 1995 that are very good. THIS is the release to get in my opinion. A third release with two discs I do not have but according to an earlier review, sounds bloated."
5,Wonderful book for someone who likes to improvise,"This would be a terrible book for someone who needs an A to Z type of instructions or has never baked before. But for those (home cooks/bakers) who know the basics of baking and only needs the guidelines and the measurements - this is a WONDERFUL book! The author doesn't patronize, doesn't try to teach you how to bake, she simply covers all the main baking categories and gives you plenty of recipes for each. It's called the BIBLE because it covers every major area of baking; it is not nor does it claim to be BAKING 101. I've been looking for a book like that for a while - too many others seem to be either geared toward the professionals with a million of steps to follow and ingredients that I can't even pronounce let alone know what they are or for the newbies who don't know what a quick bread is. This book is perfect for those who have the basics and want to expand their repertoire."
3,Industrial music feel that suits the movie well.....,"I saw the movie yesterday it was ok.I think the music is not very original but pretty good anyway.The guitars are shredding you can hear the industrial music throughout the whole movie.Not to mention that you can hear alot of songs during all of the movie.I haven""t bought the soundtrack but if you like industrial music you should give it a go.I thought the song during the ending credits was just plain awesome.I dont know the songs name but it must be lovesiege.Buckethead is still in guns n roses and hasnt been fired by the way."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I used this book for my Intro to Foensic Anbthropology class and continued to use it in Grad School. It is the only book I can find that has age determination from sternal rib ends.(not even ""Standards"" has it). HIGHLY recommend!"
1,Not as described!,"I know this is a super late review (2 years after purchase) lol but I thought I'd review this. When I read into buying this book the description said used but in good condition, so I decided to buy it to save a couple extra bucks. When i received the book the cover was torn from the upper right side and was just clear tapped. The disc that comes with it was cracked in half and scratched. So the item wasn't as described. But even so the book served its purpose."
5,Wrong Size Bolts For Assembly,"For those fixing to buy this grill: I found upon assembly that there is a problem in using the 1/4"" x 20 x 1"" SS(Stainless Steel) bolts that are furnished. Throw these away and go to your nearest Ace Hardware and buy 1/4"" x 20 x 3/4"" SS bolts instead. The ones furnished are a cheap grade and too long. I broke two on assembly myself. Called Weber and informed them of the problem, just waiting now to see if someone from the engineering department calls me back. This is the only complaint I have about this grill, it's ABSOLUTELY PERFECT ON EVERYTHING ELSE !!!!!!! I'll rate it with 5 stars, shipping and the price were unbelieveable too."
1,Terrible,This was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen and that is being nice. A total waste of money.
4,summer nights,"This album is really sweet. It's the perfect music for a glass of wine on a long summer evening, that's about the only way I can describe how it feels. The songs seem old, something you'ld expect from an old french movie, and the texts are really nice."
4,Definitely Going Somewhere,"The first English-language recording from Keren Ann is sure to elicit comparisons to Francoise Hardy, but there's more of an English folksinger/bossa nova vibe to her Blue Note debut, like Astrud Gilberto singing the Nick Drake songbook. Her voice is delicate, yet sure; the arrangements intricate, yet spare. Some may miss the electronic textures of previous albums, ""La Biographie de Luka Philipsen"" and ""La Disparition"", but Keren Ann sounds more like herself now, less like a French Beth Orton. When foreign artists sign to American record companies and start singing in English, it's usually the kiss of death, but this is Keren Ann's best record yet."
4,Deconstructing Joan,"Warner writes for the post-modern reader, and the nature of her task is questioning. She questions everything that's ever been knwon or assumed about Joan (except her chasity), which makes for a disorienting but challenging read.She may, in fact, be able to lead us to a better understanding of this incredible historical figure altogether."
3,Not a summer beach book,"Joan of Arc is interesting and informative. It is not, however, an ordinary history book. I enjoyed the first half of the book; Ms. Warner looks at all of the information in creative ways that don't ordinarily appear in most history books. The problem many people will have is that this is not just a history book. It deals with the perception of Joan as an icon, heroine or whatever(It is subtitled The Image of Female Heroism). The problem for me came with the second half of the book. Most readers will not enjoy the examination of semantics, symbolism, Jung, and any of the countless mythical and historical figures. I say all of this despite the fact that I was prepared to criticise the other critics in the review section. I thought perhaps they resented the feminist angle. After reading the whole book I can say that the second half will wear you out; it is a tough read only for those with more interest or intellect than myself."
2,Badly Flawed.,"I wanted to like this book; but despite the reasonable amount of research that went into it, the author ignores so much of the evidence and invents so many of her own fantasized views about Joan (some of which are merely repetitions of the slander levelled against her by her enemies) that it qualifies as distortion rather than history. Try one of Regine Pernoud's books (offered here at Amazon) instead."
1,It's unanimous!,"Sevwn reviewers have written before me, and I fully agree with them: this DVD does NOT teach you how to interpret facial expressions. It just follows the now discarded notion that you can guess people's personality from their physical face attributes.What a waste of time and money!!"
1,Not what you think it is.,This is not about how to read facial expressions but how a person will act or feel based on genetic characters.
2,How to read faces,This was not what I thought it was going to be. The person in the video would have been better if she was not speaking with a british accent. The quality of the dvd was great however as far as the picture was concerned.
1,not what i expected,when amazon recomended this book to be coupled with a body language book i imagined the two items to compliment each other. In actuallity this dvd is not about reading the emotions or reactions based on facial expressions.
1,do not buy this product! It is far worse than my English writting. Thats how bad it is!!,"I have never ever wasted my money on a porduct as bad as this dvd.Its a bunch of bull from the beginning to the end... no scientific facts or arguments just a 50 year old lady telling stories like.. if your upper lip is fat then you like to share youre feelings, while if you have a slim upper lip... than you like to be left alone! and this kind of bull will go on for 50 minutes.It is far worse than my English writting. Thats how bad it is!!"
1,The pain stopped only after I stopped the VCR,"This video was terrible! If you like watching some British lady with terrible teeth in a slutty dress talk in an unintellible accent for an hour, this movie is for you. I understood every third word she was saying: subtitles would have helped. Also, the production was very poor: this was shot on somebody's VHS camera in a basement and they stopped the camera every 30 seconds or so.Apart from that, the ""professor"" didn't ground this type of study with any type of science. It seemed very subjective and general.This movie sucked."
1,Not As Expected,The product name and subsequent narrative on this product leads one to believe that you will learn how to read facial expressions of those you deal with versus a book about genetic facial structure having little to do with understanding those that you're dealing with.
1,There was no option for less than 1 star...,"For the gentlemen looking for interview and interrogation, try Wicklander associates or look into Paul Eckman resources. I've only formally studied the subject matter for 15 years, but it took less than 15 minutes to figure this was a fraud.I'm sorry to say I will not put in enough time to determine the root cause of the bunk, or for her benefit, poppycock and balderdash.Tying experience with a facial attribute is impossible. This is neither scientific nor valuable in any way.It's possible she's stupid enough to believe this. It's possible that it's just a send me money DVD. It's possible she's mentally infirm, as that is the way she appears at times.Whatever the case, after watching this I only feel like I know less than I did before. Watching this will only destroy valuable brain cells that you may need later. I've only met one person I couldn't read in the last 5 years. Now, I'm afraid I won't be able to read any."
4,perfect gift for new picnicers,I bought this for my sister after suggesting her and the hubby should picnic at the Walker Art Center sculpture gardens in Minneapolis and discovering they had no cork screw during a visit. The newlyweds were using his swiss army knife!I loved that it was compact and insulated for whites and more importantly she cannot wait to use it!I would give it 5 stars if it had glass glasses.
5,Care for a drink?,"I bought this picnic pack as a gift for a friend of mine that just moved across the street from the beach in San Diego. I have another Picnic at Ascot item that I have been impressed with and wanted to send him something enjoyable for his new home. When he received it, he was very excited. He really enjoys it and has used it often. He says it's compact and easy to carry and he appreciates that it's not a pink/purple/pastel color! LOL!"
4,works well but...,"it works well for carrying a bottle of wine, even better with an ice pack tucked inside. The cups are cheap plastic ones but I swopped them for some stemless glasses I had."
1,bloody awful 'ol chap,"I wholeheartedly agree with the person who gave this book one star. Kudoes to you, old boy, you hit the proverbial nail on the proverbial head; this book was bloody awful. Are we really supposed to care and/or empathize with these bohemian pedophiles and tramps? Unfortunately, I am one of those readers that feel compelled to finish a book once I start it. I assure you, this was slow torture, the likes of which Hitler's henchmen could only dream about. Godwin and the Lolita-like Cilla are the most unsympathetic hero/heroine pair to ever appear in print. And it was, oh, so boring. I had intended to read The Wind Chill Factor next, as it is supposed to be good, but after reading this rubbish, I am going to have to think long and hard before delving into another Thomas Gifford novel."
1,"Boring, tedious and oh so many words","Why write a 716 pages ""thriller"", which does not start ""thrilling"" until page 148 and even then is just one cliche after the other. The author being American the story is mainly about English people and the chararcters are all paper thin (Englishmen go to Eton and say ""old chap"", they dine in the Ritz, bla, bla). Who are reading these books? Housewives in Idaho who never had a chance to cross the state border? I gave up halfthrough and I will never know who the traitor was! Oh, gosh. Yawn, yawn. How about no stars at all.............."
3,Not What I Expected,"This book is just an appetizer. Written mainly for pre-adolescents, it is a great way to stimulate more in-depth interest in this elegant ocean liner. The sorts of details I was looking for just weren't there."
5,the unblessed world of When...,"Lars Pedersen is a musical genius. He was a member of the Norwegian/Polish experimental new wave act Holy Toy. His solo music defies categorization, ranging from semi-conventional songs like 'Afterzone' to sampling collage epics (such as 'Death in the Blue Lake' and 'The Black Death', both of which appear in various excerpts here) to plainly grotesque miniatures (witness 'Paint the Dance' or 'Fragments'). There is often a strong reference to myths and folklore ('Gynt'). Connoisseurs who have been following his career will be delighted to find the inclusion of the entire flip side of the LP 'Death in the Blue Lake' (bar one track - 'Followed by Water'). This is an excellent starting point for the adventurous beginner, and an absolute must for the fan, because of the unreleased/first time on CD material - and with a total of 39 tracks on 2 CD's, there is no shortage of it."
5,Andreuccio,"Andreuccio Da Perugia (Italian Easy Readers, Series A)is a nice book for someone with fluent Italian or someone who knows just a bit of the language. It's an important piece in its history, short, easy to read, and entertaining. The copy I got is used, and in great condition if you don't mind a few words already translated for you. I'm happy with it."
4,Italiam Folktales,"I love this book! I read this at my grandparents house when I was younger. Now, I have a child and I hope he enjoys these stories as much as I did."
1,The Kindle version is not the same book as the print...,"I was sorely disappointed to discover that the contents of the Kindle version ARE NOT the same as the print version. The Kindle version has only 53 tales, the print version over 200. The Kindle version is translated by Louis Brigante. The print version is translated by George Martin. Consequently, NONE of the reviews or the Book Description noted on the page for this item are accurate or relevant. It is a completely different publication. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT THE ORIGINAL COLLECTION. Rated 1 star only to complete the review. This rating does not reflect any impression of the original title, which is not what you get when you purchase the Kindle version. I will seek a credit for this mislabeled item."
2,"Inventive tales, dryly told","I'm a big fan of Katherine Briggs' voluminous works on British folktales. During winter I would relish reading one or two of her stories, tucked up in bed, with a nice cup of cocoa beside me. I hoped to have the same experience from this volume.The prose in this collection is dry and sparse, more suitable for reading in a deck chair on a cruise ship. Not that that's a bad thing, but a very different experience."
4,The old translation was better...,"HELP! When I was a kid, we had a version of this entitled ""Italian Fables"". This book is the same thing, but a much different and much less humorous translation. BOO. I want the old funny one that I had when when I was a kid; it makes a great gift for friends who have a baby..."
5,Does everything it should,We bought these mats because we recently purchased a car with leather seats and have two car seats. The mats cover the seat completely and the pockets for toys come in handy. I am very satisfied with this product. The price was also reasonable for what you receive.
1,Buyer Beware,Turned my light gray leather car seat yellow in all the places the mat touched it. The dye from the mat must have bled. The car seat is ruined.
1,WARNING!!!!!! WILL STAIN SEATS!!!,This product Stained our Tan leather seats...Be Ware!!! It works great but our seats are stained from the backing on the bottom of this product. WARNING!!!!
3,very useful,"I got a BMW 5 series and hate to see my kids making mess while i'm driving...especially with any liquid or sweet stuffs. This mat doesn't protect that well from liquid spills and ice cream mess. Howerer, it does product scratches from baby seats and nothing more or less."
3,So-so,"I bought this book partly out of shock value, and I kept it on my coffee table for probably a year. Most visitors who came to my house spent at least a few minutes with a story or two. There are some gems here (Adequate Dick, 1-800-yor-dick, and a few others) but many of these stories are sadly dull. Perhaps 50 women was too many to ask, as many of them had the same things to say. Most certainly an entertaining read and a great conversation piece, but at the same time it's little more than brain candy and mostly forgettable."
2,The women behind this book don't show much inspiration,"Questions of gender and transgender experimentation might seem to open up innumerable and even fascinating discussions about sex and the sexes, but if the writings and illustrations in ""Dick for a Day"" are representative of women, penis envy is not a particularly imaginative pastime.The topic sounds provoking and the jokes are good for a cheap laugh, but the contributions within this book are the stuff of talk shows and adult party games."
1,Unimaginative,"In short, I was very disappointed at the one-note interpretation of what could have been a fantastic, creative expression of being endowed with a manhood for a day. I read it once-with some effort, and gave it away."
3,They are silk.,"That's about it. Nothing special. My wife likes them, I like how they feel on her. Overall just like any other silk panties out there.I will say, I bought them at a reduced rate: I would not have, and would not now, pay $10 for them."
2,A Glorified Car Vac,This is basically a dustbuster with a handle. Couldn't hold a charge and ran down after about 20 seconds. This was after a couple of years of rare use. Maybe that was the problem. I threw it out.
1,not so good,this puzzle is so hard we could not even get the border finished let alone start the rest of the puzzle. Multiple pieces would fit into multiple places and you could not figure out which piece was really in the right place
4,SENATOR'S WIFE,Senator's Wife. Just wanted to keep on reading. Sorry when I finished it. Will continue to read more of her books.
4,Pretty darn good,"I almost didn't read it be because off the reviews but it was a darn good book. I liked that Ronnie was not a completely rootable heroine. I also enjoyed the love story and mystery. Well written, soapy and a fun read."
1,Please don't waste my time!!!!,"Yeah Right, I've got moral issues here, big time!!! Why would an author of some really good fiction stoop to creating a heroine who could not command respect from anyone? She is, first of all, a goldigger, secondly, she is a cheat, casting her eyes on guys while accepting a sumptious lifestyle from her husband. Thirdly, she is immoral. If she doesn't like her husband's extracurricular activities she should get out of the marriage. Instead she chose to stay and sneak around behind his back. I don't know who could like this gal, or this book, for that matter..A waste of time and money!!!"
2,Disappointing - Karen usually does better,I have to agree with others reviews that if this is your first Karen Robards book - PUT IT BACK - and read any other one before this one. It is hard to find redeeming qualities in this heroine. It is difficult to read a book when you can neither sympathisize with her dilemmas or rationalize her decisions. I don't like gals who marry for money and extramarital affairs never appeal to me.
1,It gets only a little better,"This is the first of Robards books I've read and it will likely be my last. Her 'heroine' isn't at all likeable. Her greed drove her to marry a man old enough to be her father who was a known philanderer. Actually, almost everyone in this novel commits adultery. And constantly telling us how gorgeous the 'heroine' is and how every man wants to jump her bones does nothing to make her likeable.The book gets a little better when it FINALLY addresses the suspense part of the plot but leaves out a great deal of detail and is fairly predictable. I selected this author because it sounded like she had a good track record but I fail to see how."
4,Karen Robards at her best!,"I really liked the characters - it wasn't the usual fluff and stuff, but so what. It was realistic and I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
3,This book could have been a good mystery.,"The story started out as a pretty good murder mystery with some interesting characters, but by the middle of the book, she get too involved in household furnishing, rugs, wallpaper etc. She has the 2 main characters obsessively fantasizing about one another. As a result, I thought the story line and the plot turned boring and predicatable."
1,Far from my favorite by this author!,"I've enjoyed a number of Robbards' recent books such as Hunter's Moon and Walking After Midnight. I can't recommend The Senator's Wife with much enthuiasm, however. Robbard's heroines are usually strong women who deal admirably with responsibility, adversity and danger. Here she has created a heroine who has married into money and power for all the wrong reasons and is miserable because of it. In fact, her ways of dealing with her prediciment are to either lean on others or induldge in self-destructive behavior. It was difficult to have any sympathy at all for the heroine untill she is unjustly accused of a murder. A secondary character, a hooker and single mom (durring the novel becoming an ex-hooker) in danger because of what she knows is more like a typical, resourceful, Robbards heroine."
1,DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE,"I automatically pick up any book with Ms. Robards name on it. This is one I should have left on the shelve. I didn't care for Ronnie at all. She married for money so you can't feel sorry for her. Too many extramarital affairs in this book (I guess that's the way of politics.) Bypass this book, but pick up ""Sea Fire"", ""Island Flame"", and ""Tiger's Eye"". You won't be disappointed."
2,COME ON KAREN YOU CAN DO BETTER & HAVE!!!,"IF YOU HAVE NEVER READ A BOOK BY KAREN ROBARDS - DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. BUY ANY OTHER ONE FIRST. I was terribly disappointed in this book. I always get Karen Robards new books usually without reading the blurb on the back because she has never yet disappointed me (UNTIL NOW!).The main character is married and falls into an affair with the hero which she justifies by saying she hasn't slept with her husband in a year and her marriage hasn't turned out like she thought it would. Sorry but to me that just doesn't cut it.The murder mystery isn't bad but I just couldn't get over the fact that the heroine was a cheating wife.Come on Karen, you can do better & you have!"
1,What happened?,"I usually like Karen Robard's books but this was simply awful. The characters were shallow and the lead female (definitely cannot be described as a heroine) was appalling - the type of woman who gives gold-digging a bad name! She was selfish, thoughtless, dislikable and most importantly STUPID, and the fact that the lead male couldn't resist her reflected even more badly on him. I am trying to think of a single character here who I can be positive about, but I can't find one. I started reading but ended up skimming through this in about an hour, it wasn't worth even that much time.Borrow it if you must, but don't buy it."
3,if you can get through the first 100 pages...,"I fought the urge to return the book the first night I started reading it but once I got through the first 100 pages, I couldn't put it down. The passion between Ronnie and Tom kept me turning the pages."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK !!!,"I bought the tape. I am so glad that I only had to waste 3 hours listening. The wording on the back of the tape had different characters names so I had to stop and see if I had a same theme. It was. Too bad. Karen, you are one of my favorite authors, but you missed it on this one. Good thought but bad premises. Do you really think some one like Ronnie would give it all up for Tom after she has fought hard to get where she was? Get real. I know the goings on in Washington is shady, but to kill off everyone to hide a secret? I don't think so. If this was true Washington DC would be a dead city. I know this is fiction, but at least make it believable. Hope your next one is better."
2,Good premise but vague.,"The tension between Tom, the political consultant, and Ronnie, the Senator's wife was well explored. I liked Tom's Mother and enjoyed the description of her home. The political references were sometimes unbelievable, however. For instance, naming the dog ""Jefferson Davis"" felt uncomfortable to me, i.e. offensive to some while others might think it cute. I can't imagine a modern political consultant ever coming up with that idea. At the end, I felt I was left hanging in regard to Tom's career. Also, the story did not give any insight into what motivated Tom's partner to stay in the business or to make the kind of choices he made. It was a cute but confusing read."
5,From one who teaches Broadcast Engineering...,"I teach Radio/Television Broadcasting (along with being Director of Engineering, CMAT) at a State University. I read this book and many others trying to find the perfect book to use in the B'cast Engineering courses I teach here. This book is by far the best I've ever seen for the beginner to novice Engineer. I started my B'cast career in 1978 -- I wish this book would have been around then, or even during my first 5 years!!! It's written in simple terms making it easy to understand, yet completely covers the subject to the most technical aspects. If you're majoring in Communications and have an eye on the technical side, GET THIS BOOK!Gregory"
2,More like a dictionary,I was expecting a little bit of how-to in this book but it definitely is not that. It basically is an expanded dictionary of terms used in the broadcast industry. It includes a few diagrams such as a flow chart of Master Control. Meant for total outsiders to the industry. Best suited for a broadcast school where a person has no idea what broadcasting is all about.
5,A book for the thinking man.,"One sure way to beat anyone at anything is to know their possible strategies ahead of time and find ways to counter them. Mr Knight has offered men that opportunity with his book. Rather than making me shake in my shoes, I found useful information which gave me a ""heads up"" to possible pitfalls and flaws in my plan. Thank you, Mr Knight."
2,Hot item,The only complaint I have is the the tuner gets really hot and at times the volume will increase on its own and I'm unable to adjust it unless I turn the unit off and on and then adjust the volume. The unit gets so hot that there are times when I'm afraid this unit will catch on fire.
1,Horrible,"I bought this gift for my Mother last Christmas. It never did work and of course we did not get a refund. I do not recommend. It was not clear at the time I purchased that this was a remanufactured item, but regardless it did not work and I'm still very upset."
4,corner pot rack,This looks great and is high quality construction. The hooks are configured well and it is easy to lift pots off and to put them on. I wish it was a bit bigger though.
2,Bonus Features?,"This is my favorite TV Series ever, and, in case you don't know already - this season was positively excellent. It breaks my heart to give this 2 stars, but the season 1 and 2 DVD collections had gobs of bonus features - deleted scenes, character comentary, making of featurrettes, you name it, it was there. There is no bonus content for the season 3 (and onwards) DVDs at all. Nothing. Even the menus feel cheap and tacked on. It's like they spent no time on these things. They crammed everything onto double sided disks to save a few bucks, and gave us no extra content because that would cost them 1 extra disk - like, 50 cents extra per DVD set.I want to cry, and I want my 30 dollars back. I don't know about you, but I can see the episodes on TV already, the extra features are why I buy the DVDs."
3,Yup...,"This show is pretty dull, it does have it's moments but the idea of a cartoon, you must have atleast a little bit of hyperrealism!"
3,Good price. BAD shipping,The price was very reasonable. But poor packaging coupled with poor manufacturing caused damage to the purchased dvd's. I purchased three seasons of king of the hill which where all crammed into one small bubble mailer. Vibrations during shipping caused scratches on the first disk of each season from the enclosed theft protection device from the manufacturer rubbing against the front of the disk surface as they traveled through the usps. I would say half manufacturers fault half the sellers poor packaging. I spent $9 s&h to get three box sets crammed into a $ .89 cent mailer. ULTRA LAME!
3,Not so pleased with the product itself,"I am assuming few people would be looking at these DVDs if they weren't familiar with the show, so rather than commenting on ""King of the Hill"" itself, I will base my review on the product.These DVDs fooled me and my two brothers for quite awhile, as it wasn't immediately obvious that the discs are two-sided. This is frustrating, as the only way to identify the disc is by the tiny circular print around the hole in the middle of the DVD. So if you feel like you burned through these way too fast, chances are there are episodes on the ""B-side"" you haven't seen yet!Also, this arrived with the plastic of the DVD case ripped in the upper right corner. I didn't mind enough to send it back, but I was a bit surprised to receive a new DVD set in that condition.Bottom line - if you enjoy ""King of the Hill,"" you'll take the A-side, B-side thing in stride and be very happy that you added this DVD set to your collection!"
3,Up and coming but not quite there yet,"The opening seconds of ""Hear Their Own"" miraculously manage to match the best moments of Morbid Angel, Hypocrisy, and the rest of the death metal elite. Sadly, nothing else on the album comes close to achieving such heights of hostile clarity, but there is ample evidence that Deep may be somewhat in the same league, if a bit slower to develop. Delving lyrically into the abyss of loss and suffering, this quartet sidestep the usual forays into the supernatural and flirt instead with the ideological miasma of the Goths and doom merchants. All in all, there are enough hooks and melodic yearning on ""Pieces of Nothing"" to make Deep one to watch out for."
3,Which Witch is Which?,"Not a bad presentation by Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman. Although much of it is predicatable the ending is not. I recommend viewing the alternative ending in addition. It would seem, in my opinion, one ending was intended for a European audience and the other for Americans. I think the European ending was more fascinating and truer to the supernatural theme. I think it was a fair movie, so three stars. The role played by Claire Foy was under played and could have been enhanced."
4,Way better than Expected!!!,"An edge of your seat fun movie! Will really get your blood pumping. Not historically accurate, but was a lot of fun to watch. Some scenes will make you jump out of your seat."
2,It Lacked a lot,This movie needed something more than just the painfully obviousness to it all. It was nothing more than taking a witch to her death. Not even suspenseful.
3,Disappointed,"I was impatient for this DVD to become available for purchase.Once I had purchased it,I couldn't wait to get home and put it in the player sit back and watch it.Nicolas Cage played his part well but that kid that came into his shop drove me nuts and found each time he did something or spoke I couldn't wait for him to be off the screen and felt they could have chosen another actor who would have played the part a 1,000 times better.To think before viewing this movie it would be on my favourite list of best movies and I would watch it again and again is now totally a no it won't.Shame, as with my expectations of this being another fabulous fantasy movie I would enjoy again and again, and with a favourite actor, Nicolas cage in it, that ""kid"" let this movie down for me, making it one that will probably sit on a shelf gathering dust.It's only Nicolas that got the 3 stars I gave."
2,season of the witch,"the movie was to short to me . I think they could of made it alittle bet longer and it would of turn a good movie into a great movie. Like make there trip take longer, and make the fight seens longer. it just went to fast and jumped around to much . It almost seemed that the move was made in a rans to see how fastthe could make one"
2,Wasted effort,"It's starts out as something of a mystery. Mr. Cage refrians from too much hamming it up. Is she a witch? Is she an innocent? Is she something in-between? You're drawn in by the atmosphere and the questions.....but like revealing the man behind the curatin, the director spoiled his chance at true spookiness with cgi silliness and a lame-brained explanation. Too bad, here were good production values and mood."
3,Season of the Witch,"The stars in the movie were great, but the story line wasn't good at all. At times, it was hard to follow."
4,What About The Witches,"I dont think there were any actual witches in this movie, but I dont want to spoil it. It is an interesting movie, and I enjoyed it. I liked the ""witch"" and her power. She was pretty awsome. I love the twist, also I think it was overshadowed. Great idea, it just didnt hit that spot in the audience, or at least it didnt hit me. Still great idea and I did enjoy it. The young boy in the end, has beautiful eyes. The ""witch"" was awsome -or at least the source of her power was. I admit I was kind of hoping it would win. Just to see what would happen. NE way, great movie -it took long enough for it to come out. A lot of people dont dig Nicholas Cage as an actor and I will admit, he isnt that great of a performer, but I like him. There is something about him that I enjoy seeing him in movies."
2,This is not a good movie.,"I really regret renting and watching this movie. I felt this way about 15 minutes into it. Maybe I could've called Amazon and ""turned back""? Anyway, the acting was poor, but the writing was far worse! And does every movie studio have the same special effects program or software?? Everything is starting to look THE SAME. When's the last time anyone saw an actual fire in a movie? How about smoke? Nicholas Cage hasn't been in a decent movie in ages..."
2,"Uh, ok.","I didn't think I would find a Cage movie as bad as Captain Correli's Mandolin but I guess I have. I don't know what was worse, the set or the writing... or the bad imagineered demon, which reminded me too much of the alien I hated from Independence Day. Sure, there were a few nail-biting moments but really, only very few. I now know why I never heard of this movie when it was released. Was it in the theater? I am upset about wasting $5 renting this through my On Demand. I would have been pissed spending $11 at the theater. Weird. I just feel weird about it."
2,Not worth My money,"They used only about 30 actors and extras and POORLY drawn CG for there armys, The acting is just fair, and so is the story line. But a movie can get by on poor acting and poor directing by one like this is made for it's special effects, and the effects in this movie are ""B"" rating at best. I wish I rented something else and I'm consoled that I didnt by it, even my 17 year old Son didnt like it which is really sad."
1,DON'T DON'T DON'T WATCH THIS,"While I am pretty easy going on movies and usually only rate the very very bad ones, this one was completely the worst of the worst. Lame acting, extremely bad plot line and not worth the five dollars I spent buying this used. I wish I could return this, however I have opted to shred this particular movie so no one else has to sit through the agony of watching it. It has been officially taken out of cirulation."
2,failed to deliver,i only saw it because my girl friend is a Nick Cage fan. i can't stand him and this is one those movies that proves it. i mean the acting wasn't horrible but the movie just .... well failed to deliver.you're sitting there watching a small convoy transport a prisoner to some monks. and on the way they have visitors. it's almost like a bad lord of the rings movie. they're walking through the whole movie and a few fight scenes. but like i said a BAD lord of the rings movie. there's hardly no fighting. and it left me with a sence of ok the good part has to be coming up soon.... but it never happened. just a long drawn out movie with little action. and the action that was there was rather boring.
1,Save Your Money ...,"I like Nick Cage. I truly do. Knowing was a great movie. I even enjoyed Ghostrider. But this one was lacking in so many areas that the enjoyment of such a movie was totally not happening. The main characters, we don't TRULY get to know them at all. The beginning of the movie was okay ... but then the scenes with war after war after war after war after war after ... well, you get my point. Ugh. The ending (both of them) ... left much to be desired. Save your money, folks. Wait for it to come to television and then watch it for free if you can bring yourself to do so."
3,Good Childrens Movie,"This is surly a move for children, ages 6 to 14 and adults should not consider it."
3,Rotten Meter Way Off,"Rotten Tomatoes 8% rating for this flix is way, way too low. A movie teaming Cage and Pearlman (Ghost Rider plus Hellboy) is worth at least a look-see. The film is not great, but it is not terrible either. It's entertainment. And, for a couple of bucks, worth a couple of hours of diversion."
2,Money talks,"You watch this movie and thinK ""What could make Cage and Perlman, take part in such... amateurish, pretentious, funky-plotted story? It won't hurt to see, but it's not worthy to have it, not even for the fans."
4,This is worth a look,When I seen this movie I passes thinking it looked cheesy and looked like another miss for mr. cage. But then I rented it thinking I got some time to kill....Well to me it was well worth it and I now regret not seeing this in the theater.The Entertainment value of this movie was awesome.The story was very intresting and you get caught up in it real quick.I could of used alot more blood and guts for this type of movie but it was still realy good.This is not a typical Sword and sorcery movie it has its twist and turns.I realy enjoyed this movie and thought it was done very well.
4,Not a bad movie.,Season of the Witch was not a bad movie. It was eerie and full of action. The story was decent and the acting could have been better but all in all I would rate this movie a 6.5 or 7 out of 10. The plot twists will keep you guessing and the special fx are A1. I would definitely watch this one again.
2,Just didn't click,"The cast is OK, the script is OK, the scenery and photography are also OK.However citing some other reviewers, it feels way too much like a B-Movie, (if you are not in the mood, don't watch it), watching it actually made me feel I wasted my time and yes there are way too many cliches you can almost guess all the movie, borderline on cheesy.The trailer certainly mislead me... oh well...My final though I would only pay for it on or under $3"
4,Fine Movie,I just wanted to help increase the ratings of this movie because I thought it was a fine movie. Filmed in Austria and other East European countries.
3,Who Buys the Drinks Tonight?,"3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodPretty damn good ""Dark Ages"" satanic/witch movie! Which asks the question, which is more evil, ""the Church"" the ""Templers"" fight for, or the woman accused of being a witch that has brought on the ""Black Plague?""Nicholas Cage & Ron Pearlman star. Love both these actors, but their obvious American accents & some seemly out of place, out of time frame dialog early on, tend to knock this down a half notch for me. Call me picky & possibly naive to what people actually said, & how they said it back in the dark ages. I'm used to at the minimum, British accents, & not two buddy's fighting a battle & talking about whoever makes the most kills buys the drinks tonight, LOL!Still, a highly entertaining film with very good special effects, & even manages to build up some good dread along the way. Nicely filmed!"
3,mediocre film,"i like nicholas cage, but it wasn't his highlight in the movie division..it was ok and had it's moments...thanks so much"
3,"Eh, it's ok",If you are in the mood for a cheesy fantasy flick then I say rent it. Keep your expectations low and you might just like it.
1,Don't waste your money,This was bloody horrible. Wait till it is at least 99 cents or free on Prime. Don't pay more for it...
2,"Silly, Silly, Silly","A deeply silly film, not quite bad enough to be good. It had some potential, but the writing is so bad, the cliches so constant, and the acting so weak that in the end I was just waiting in desperation for it to end."
2,"Dear Hollywood, are good scripts really so cost prohibitive that you can't afford to buy one?","I'm a sucker for all things medieval. Throw in a little evil, and I figured it was worth a watch. After the first few minutes of terrible dialogue, I began to second guess this hypothesis. In addition to the cheesy script, the technical aspects were shabby, especially the green screen work and costuming choices such as Cage's wig. The movie's saving grace is the performance by Claire Foy (Little Dorrit). Her pixie charm casts a spell, leaving us suspended between wondering if we can keep her, and wondering why they didn't bring more holy water."
1,Moviie is STUPID,"I was really looking forward to this movie and usually enjoy Nicholas Cage movies. This one annoyed me because instead of having a knowledgeable perspective it ended up being an ignorant bunch of old rubbish about what Christians for hundreds of years have insisted in believing..So they could hang, hack, and burn people who probably weren't witches to begin with. It was a huge waste of my time and I wish I could give it NO stars."
1,Complete garbage,This was a pain to watch. If they had made it a comical parody (a la Evil Dead) instead of trying to make it serious it would have been tolerable. Don't waste your time.
3,Dumb but fun!,"Got a lot of bad press this one, and perhaps some of it deserved. All the same, its a bit of fun! It is unfair to compare this to Black Death, which is an unrelentingly grim horror film and as such very different to SoW.There are some dodgy and WTF moments in this film (during the Crusades, none of the knights are seen riding horses, Nic Cage has rather a silly helmet but at least he wears one). But overall, if you've seen Black Death and feel like a bit of a cheer up, SoW could be the treatment you need."
4,Enjoyable movie!,I really enjoyed this movie. You really not sure at first if the woman is a witch or not. Then there was the nice little twist at the end. Really a decent enjoyable movie with pretty decent CGI.
2,"Not horrible, but nothing relatively good either","Directed by modern day schlock-meister Dominic Sena, Season of the Witch stars Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman as crusade deserters that are reluctantly tasked with escorting a young girl (Claire Foy) to trial by monks after being accused of being a witch and bringing the plague to the land. Their party also features a few other characters, and naturally, things don't go particularly well on their journey. Let it first be said that Season of the Witch is nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be when I first caught wind of it. Cage and Perlman are good in their roles, but the unbelievably predictable script (granted the bit of a twist towards the end is a surprise) and overly brisk pace don't help matters any. For all its flaws, Season of the Witch isn't all that bad really, and warrants a look as a decent enough time-waster on a rainy afternoon."
2,A HAIR ABOVE A SCI-FY TV MOVIE!!,"If I had seen this on the SCI-FY CHANNEL as a TV movie, I would have been OK with it. Unfortunately I was taken by the hyped up trailer and paid money to see mediocrity at it's best!! This film was just a short and curly hair above the crap that cable televison has to offer and it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Obviously Nick Cage is hard up for cash because of late he has made some pretty terrible films that are not worth the DVD it is copied on. The story is OK but predictable, the acting is lazy and the CGI is less than adequate. Cage and Perlman are just going through the motions to collect a paycheck and it shows through their acting and lack of british accents. There is nothing watch-worthy in this film unless you just want to fill the pockets of those involved in this turd. My recommendation, watch it on cable and you won't be as bitter with it as I am!!!"
4,A Real Tear Jerker,You will love this book to death! If you are even an adult older than 12 you will like it! I personally loved it! I can relate to the boy in this book very much. WE had so much in common. I laughed and cried so much throughout this book.
4,surfing history,This review gets 4 stars for the surfing enthusiast. A documentary about the history and birth of surfing. Focusing much of the film on the older days of surfing & the evolution of the surfboard. Does include some contemporary surfing but not enough for 5 stars. I found that the history told in this film is enlightening. Only a surfer or surfing enthusiast would give this film 4 stars otherwise the rating is about 2 or 3 stars. Don't expect to see a lot of contempoary footage because there isn't much of it.
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be like all the other surfing DVDs I have bought - plenty of waves, maybe some narrative, good surfing. I was disappointed. No surfing at all. Instead it is entirely devoted to people talking about what they enjoy or how they have been affected by the sport of surfing. Can't see myself pulling this one out of the collection to watch too often."
2,THIS WAS FOR MAC,"I have a [PC, this was for a MAC, so I will try to find someone to give it to that have small children. I may be hard, since I am over 65."
2,The kids aren't interested!,"I cannot get my 8-year old grandchildren to stay with this game. The story moves along v-e-r-y slowly, the animation is not particularly good, the acting is terrible -- it sounds like adults (trying to sound like kids) simply reading a script. Also the player has to play the game as different characters requiring much too frequent switching, which the girls find annoying. I'm sure there is a beautiful moral message in this game somewhere; it is too bad more effort wasn't put into the game itself."
4,It's a Collectible Not a Toy!!!!,This is a Statue! Not an Action Figure! The Detail is Great and The Painting Too! It Comes With Tons!!! Of Weapons!!!! This Makes it a great Collectible! It Looks Good Mint! So My Advice DO NOT TAKE IT OUT OF THE BOX! It is not for playing.
2,Two left arms,"Yea so I bought this a while back and I was really disappointed. I've been a huge fan of the games and I collect action figures and 1:18 scale cars from TV and movies. But I don't have a room full of this stuff you know. I just collect what I like. And I saw this and was really excited. When I took 47 out of the box to display on my desk I realized that instead of making two arms for the figure, the just put two LEFT arms on. The arm on his right side is just the left arm upside down. (his elbow bends in toward his chest not out away from his body.)For $45 I expected to get more from this figure."
3,Articulations Gentlemen!!,What's with the stupid statue like mold done on this figure??? I mean is he suffering from a bad back?? Seriously put an articulation on the legs.On the plus side it has the most amount of weapons I have ever seen in a toy. Bravo!!!!
4,Excellent 80's country rock-n-roll,"The sharp lead guitar of Alejandro Escovedo isn't present for Rank and File's second lp, but ""Long Gone Dead"" is nearly as good as the debut. It's more layered than ""Sundown"", with some fiddles and pedal steel, but this works well within the framework of the songs. ""The Sound of The Rain"", Rank and File's best original song, is the album's centerpiece, but the rest, including a cover of Lefty Frizzel's ""I'm An Old, Old Man"", all sound fine. Stan Lynch of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is the drummer for this outing.Rank and File would record one more album after this, for Rhino, but it was quite lame (I don't know why Collector's Choice is even releasing it, or why ""Long Gone Dead"" and ""Sundown"" aren't combined). You could tell the band knew its career was at an end when the 3rd album's acknowledgements read simply, ""Thanks, to no one."""
4,"slavery's claim was that man would own man...throw it down, John Brown!","Yeah, yeah, ""Sundown"" is just the pinnacle of awesomeness, and David Kahne knew how to get the Kinman brothers' sound to just echo and ring so wonderfully.But this CD's really good too, despite Kahne's absence. Chip and Tony's songwriting skills are still as great as ever. The title track, ""Hot Wind,"" ""John Brown,"" ""Sound of the Rain,"" ""It don't matter"" are especially good."
3,"Great Band, Less than Perfect Record","Having seen the Dils live and having watched the rebirth of the Kinman brothers as Rank and File, I always looked forward to their records. This album was a disappointment then and that still has not changed. The song writing is as good as ever. The problem is with the production. It reeks of early 80s overkill. The guitars are dressed up too much and the vocals overprocessed to the point that they sound too high. My daughter, when she heard it recently, thought Chip was a girl."
3,"Not bad, not AS good as their debut or the Dils days","In this album's version of ""Sound of the Rain"", they change the original line ""I don't listen to the cops, I wish they all were dead"" to the milder ""I don't listen to the cops, they talk with wood & lead.""That sums up what's wrong with this album, but ""Long Gone Dead"" (the song) is still great...."
2,Not for beginners,"While full of recipes, this book is very disorganized. For example, Beef Stew (2 different versions) appears several pages apart. Chicken soup, Chicken Supreme Soup; and a Chicken and Egg soup, while ALL are chicken soups, they are separated by several pages as well. Instructions like ""dump in 1 pkg yellow cake mix"" doesn't say if you are to pour in the dry cake mix or if you are to mix it into a batter form before putting it in. Somehow I think things like that would make a difference. Even the instruction for popcorn has the phrase ""...put in popcorn, not too much!!"" How are we to know how much is too much?Maybe with more experience, this would all make sense. That's what I'm looking for in a book. To answer my questions, not leave me guessing. This is not a book for a first time outdoor chef."
3,More Than Expected,"I purchased this book thinking that it would be a good beginning magic book for a group of middle schoolers interested in learning magic tricks. It seems that even though the objects are everyday, the tricks are not. This is a great book if you are willing to do the practice to master the tricks, but if you are looking for a quick trick, then keep looking."
3,Too simple,"This book is amusing but not spectacular, I would go for the street magic, Mindfreak and blaine books for something more espectacular. Decent for beginers."
3,Good Book,This is a fun little book if you are interested in learning some basic magic tricks. There is nothing earth shattering however it is a great place to learn some basic fundamental tricks to impress your friends.
2,Not even worth its already low price,"Some of the illustrations are just plain wrong. The depictions cannot be reproduced in reality. Impossible. Jumping rubber bands is one example. Making a simple twist in a rubber band, something's off here. Either the illustration or the description of the technique. Even-length fingers, no such thing. Flip your hand and catch the end of the handkerchief - you'd need a handkerchief weighing a pound. Quick and easy tricks with easily available things. Maybe a couple. For many, you'll need to be wearing a suit jacket. (Things go down your sleeve, of course.) Doing a lot of entertaining of the kids while wearing your suit? And ladies, who knows? I'm searching for a better introductory book."
3,A decent beginners book,Karl Fulves has been putting out these kinds of books for what seems like an eternity. They are good books for kids and even a skilled performer can pull some good material from these books.[...]
3,We use a lot of Garlic,I haven't decided if I like this garlic more or less than other garlic that I have used before.We use a lot of garlic in our cooking.
5,very interesting historic films from the war,"this is a pretty nifty collection of films. frankly i enjoy watching this stuff better than watching the history channel since these were made during the war to show the public what was going on, and keep morale up. you cannot exactly expect them to show war in all of its dirty and dark aspects, but you still get a strong flavor of what it was like for these men. i highly recommend this and the companion film, target for today, and also there are many similar films that are much more famous like memphis belle and combat america."
5,Spellbinding,As an attorney I find Steve Martini's works tobe very realistic in terms of how the justicesystem actually works. He is able to make theaverage person facinated by what actually goeson. All that I can say for any reader is that theyshould hold on because they are going to be takenon a ride that is full of suspense.You will suspecteveryone but the real killer will not be revealeduntil the end of the ride.
3,"Very good courtroom scenes, but....","Great courtroom scenes and observations regarding trial tactics and examination techniques. The author does not telegraph his punches, so you are excited to learn what ""our hero"" does to defend his client against seemingly overwhelming evidence to convict. The women, however, are pretty two-dimensional. Our hero's client is first and foremost a mother, whose reactions to every situation are reminiscent of a cornered mother bear protecting her cubs. The ""love interest"" is smart, and beautiful and successful, but we are never attracted to her. The opposing lawyer is just cold, mechanical and heartless, relentless in her quest to convict. Finally, the author is compelled to tie up every conceivable loose end, not only to acquit the client but to solve the crime, as though the jury would convict despite overwhelming reasonable doubt. A very good read, but credibility is strained."
4,"Martini left me shaken, not stirred","This book promised many twists and turns, and it delivered. I was stunned at the ending. The courtroom drama (and legal procedures) were quite entertaining. In addition, the action and adventure of the pre-trial investigation, complete with bombs and bullets, had me turning the pages in rapid succession. My only complaint was how the ending left the problem that some of the events were extremely coincidental - would have been much nicer if they had all been truly related in some ""cause and effect"" manner. In other words, it left me feeling that the hero of our story was very lucky."
4,Sleeper to Sweeper,"Martini's ""Undue Influence"" starts off a tad slow & builds to a sweep-you-off-your-feet thriller. Just when I had it figured out, I didn't...or did I? Murder, lust, mistrust..what more could you want? I found it much more than a courtroom drama."
5,A TRUE Thriller,"What a great book. Let me start off by saying I strongly dislike novels written in first person...and yet this is one of THE best legal thrillers out there (in MY opinion). Just fantastic! You are gonna LOVE the characters (especially the one with all the great comments to the rude men around her) and best yet, you are going to keep wondering WHO DID IT until Martini let's you find out under his conditions. From beginning to end, a well plotted book with great insight into the in's &out's of a criminal investigation."
4,Very Good Book,"This author has yet to produce anything that is not above average. You can do a lot worse. I found that this was a great book, the author does a wonderful job. This book moves along and is never dull. Lots of details that make it come alive. The characters are so interesting I wanted more of them. He does a great job in keeping the story going, even in the more dry aspects of a court room back and forth. The plot and subplots keep you interested through out the full book. It is just a good book."
3,Nice Rothko Primer,"This is a fine visual primer for many of Rothko's best works. Nice quality and color. Only caution is to note the size of the book before purchasing. It is not coffee table sized, but is rather small."
1,Use a Magnifying Glass,"This was a teeny, tiny book....in my memory, it seems to have been about 8 x 8 inches. A magnifying glass will be ""essential"" to see the paintings. For an art book, the image resolution just isn't high enough to publish in this tiny format."
3,Tiny book,"I bought this book for a weaver friend of mine. The book looks like it would have a ton of stuff in it. The seller never EVER told me when the book arrived (bad on them). This book is TINY....the size of a 7"" tablet (infact my nexus might be bigger), Less than 1"" in thickness >< and overall very hard to see the pictures well. SAD PANDA"
2,not te best choice,"after ""gotta tell u"" and ""baby come on over"", this single is just not the one that can outcome the previous singles, it's better for her to sit and wait for a better material rather than just release a single just for the sake of it, it doesn't help!better luck next time!"
3,This is one of the wierdest videos you can watch!,"In this video, Ranma learns that being a girl isn't that bad (particularly if your cute, which Ranma's girl side is) because he can get free eats. So he made the mistake in anouncing that in frount of Hoppusai. He has this special incent that allows Ranma to split with his girl side and date her. Very wierd!"
1,Animal Farm Revisited,"Marjorie Kelly stands heads above her comrades in shouting the old adage ""From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs"" from the father of wealth discrimination, Karl Marx. She pounds her pulpit to not just reform our economic society but to invert it. Her scheme for change requires more government intervention and less free capitalism. She is clearly in left field. The fedgov through their meddling in forbidding areas has created the mess we are seeing today. Corporations are abiding to compliant ethics (established by meddling government bureaucrats) and no more. Free capitalism abides to the divine ethics and does unto others as they would want done unto them. Ms. Kelly and those who like this book should reread Animal Farm, visit the Von Mises website or check economic books by Carson, Hazlitt or Sennholz."
3,Good but not great..,"This is a good CPL filter and I do not see a great deal of a difference when I compare the results with my earlier Tristar (Quantaray) CPL filter. Also, the outer ring of the filter is of the same diameter as the rotating ring, so it makes it difficult to remove it from the lens."
5,58 mm polarizer,"Polarizer was delivered within 6 days, very fast and reasonable priced. Decided to upgrade to a quality filter from Hoya instead of the much cheaper alternatives made of plastic, or lower quality. Packaging was good, no damage, and product was as advertised. Great seller, will use again."
3,no different than my UV filter,"this is a good filter, but i haven't noticed much difference between pictures taken with this and my UV filter."
5,A good example of down-to-earth design,"This book is a good resource for people who are looking to build a smaller, designed home. It shows that architects aren't just in business to build 10,000 sq. ft. trophy homes like the ones in the other two books in this series. It is full of ideas for designers and home onwners alike. It can be used as a starting point for opening up communication between client and designer. The thing I like most about this book series is that the author includes some of the construction drawings for some choice details. A student could learn a lot about how to put something together from these drawings (although, some are a little unclear and lack the neccesary context drawings, but I do this thing for a living and I like to see the whole picture when comes to why these designers came up with such COOL stuff!)"
5,The New American Cottage,"Fantastic book on architectural trends to go smaller and have more functionality with modern homes. Very refreshing to see an author not studying or photographing soulless, cookie cutter McMansions. Price was fantastic for this book. I would definitely recommend it to any architectural student or anyone wanting to remodel or build a small but fully functional home."
1,Totally unsatisfied,This item did not heat up enough to deepfry anything and it took forever to warm up....it now sets in my pantry awaiting to be thrown out.
1,Did not like the design,I returned this item and purchased another product. The plug keeps coming out since it is magnetic.
5,Must have for valve job,Used it to change valve seals on my Corvette. Works as expected and good quality built. Hard to beat for the price!
1,Worthless...,"Well, maybe not. This overproduced bilge had me on the floor in tears of laughter. Great music if you love Toto, the movie ""Flash Dance"", and arobics. If you LOVED ""Mr Roboto"", you'll LOVE ""Boys Will Be Boys"". And the album is remastered too! Now you can hear this crap in sterling, crystal clear audio! BTW, where was the demand for the remaster of this garbage?"
2,Not as good as Styx,"I had read a lot about this album, but it's a thorough disappointment.Both 'Please' and 'Fire' are a couple of uninspiring hard-rock songs, the closing 'Dear Darling (I'll be there)' is a bland ballad that does nothing to stand out from any of his other ballads and 'Boys will be boys' sounds really silly, but I admit it's entertaining. The song 'Fire' doesn't even sound like a Dennis DeYoung song.The title track 'Desert Moon' is a strong ballad, nice melody, 'Don't wait for heroes' is a prophetic rocker that definitely wouldn't be out of place on a Styx album. The only 'progressive' song is 'Gravity', an airy song with some interesting synths and a jazzy feeling to it.Kind of a let-down really. Goes straight to predictable, bland 80's pop, though it isn't as synth drenched as most albums of the time. It's not all bad, but doesn't stack up against Styx albums in terms of creativity or song-writing."
2,Not my type of book.,Story starts with a slip about a grown child's sexuality. This type of story does not interest me so I stopped reading.
4,A Reasonably Good Book on Sculpture - Various Media,"This book is a reasonably good book on sculpture on various media (plastic, wood, clay, etc.) with a good show of pictures in it. Works of various shapes in different ""flavor""---modern, tribal, etc.A book that is worth taking a good look and perhaps you want want a copy on your book shelf."
5,Great addition to Thomas Wooden Railway,"My son had been asking for a tunnel for his Thomas Wooden Railway collection for quite awhile, but I was unable to locate one. This one fits perfectly and he loves it."
3,Yep it's a tunnel,"China Made, YES. Kid happy with another wood train piece, Yes. It's a tunnel.. running out of things to write."
1,too small,way too small. none of our trains will fit through the tunnel and what good is a tunnel that no trainbs will fit through?? very disappointed
5,great tunnel to supplement son's thomas set,"i wanted a tunnel to go with my son's thomas set...found this one on amazon. arrived quickly, and is very durable. we've had it for over a year, it's been thrown and slammed around and is still going strong. great buy."
5,This movie is Awesome.,"This film is a great motion picture. Bruce Abbott, and Jeffrey Combs do a fine performance. Pretty much the plot is the same concerning the liquid green formula that brings dead people alive once again. The sex scenes are okay. Bruce Abbott makes love to a nice slender voluptuous Chilean Girl who looks quite hot. The theme song is really quite nice. This movie is very good, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see quality acting, and a great plot. This is the only review you need to read, all others are just not as enthusiastic as this one."
2,"The idea was there, but nothing else.","What a great idea-bring the dead back to life. Actually, they are 'REANIMATED'. With one little shot to the head all dead things can be reanimated. With: a BETTER script, BETTER acting, BETTER filming, BETTER effects, this COULD'VE been a good film. It looks like a rush job fresh from the 1-hour place."
2,"Like Re-Animator, Only Less So","Campy, silly horror, stressed story, poor acting, hit-and-miss effects. The not quite camp classic sequel to a camp classic that also is barely worth watching, and certainly not worth owning. Only for die hard fans of the original."
2,Don't Waste Your Time or Your Money,"The picture quality is decent, the audio horrible. It has this annoying hiss and when you put it in stereo the hiss just gets louder when the rest of the audio. The story itself is boring and been done before. I realize they were paying homeage to ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", but this movie is an insult to that classic horror film. Not only that, it is an insult to the first ""Re-Animator"" movie which is a modern classic. Skip this stinker."
3,One thing really bugged me about this movie,"Reanimator could have been a better movie than it was. One thing that really bugged me was the scene in the mortuary where they reanimate that naked guy. When the naked guy gets drilled through by a surgical instrument you can see it's obviously fake...just watch the bottom of the screen...it's hilarious, but it also spoils this otherwise great movie for me."
3,"""IT'S ALIVE""!!","Rather dissapointing sequel, but not totally a bad film. 'Bride of Re-Animator' (Re-Animator 2, in UK) has the standard gore and blood-soaked humour of the previous film.I thought David Gale (Dr.Hill) died in real life after 'Re-Animator' came out? Did I read wrong? Anyway if you liked the original, you may as well view this. I'd also like to see if the much rumoured 'Beyond Re-Animator' emerges in 2002."
3,Not as good as the original,"When you first watch this film, be sure to realize that it is trying to capitalize on perhaps one of the best horror films ever. Compared to Re-animator, Bride is much gorier, violent, humorous, and cheesy. But it doesn't work as well as the original did. The plot is much worse than the first one and deviates from the original Lovecraft text. The effects are good however, and the acting is still top notch. But while watching this movie, you can feel the lack of great direction by Gordon. It seems like Brian Yazuna tries to make everything funny and gross at the same time and it doesn't work as well as it did when it was unintentional as in the original. Bride is still entertaining and worth a look if you like goofy horror movies, but don't expect the magic of the original."
4,Jeffery Combs is great,Jeff Combs is one of the greatest Cult actors up to date. this movie just proves my point.
2,Frankenstein-well sort of!,"Ok, of all the Re-Animator movies, this one is by far the worst, it has its moments and even some laughs, but all the movie is, is a rip-off of The bride of Frankenstein. The old story of man loses girl friend, but mad scientist keeps dead girl's heart and builds a body around the frozen heart, with of course the help of the girl's boyfriend. I don't think his was what H.P. Lovecraft had in mind when he wrote the story about the Re-Animator and I think he turned over in his grave when this movie was released. Even Jeffery Combs could not save this one, it is too predictable and lame. The original Re-Animator and Beyond the Re-Animator are pretty good and worth owning, this was was the flat tire of the bunch. Back to the Drawing board Doc!"
3,paging dr. west,"this movie is really gorey and really funny at times. Combs has never been better and he gets inside his character well but theres a lot of things that I really felt that this movie was gonna suck and some of that was true. now with a cut off head with bat's wings and the finale which was really dumb, i'd say Yuzna smashed the cult hit off its throne but he didnt. later in beyond re-animator he does. in this one its cool to watch Abbott being pushed around by Combs and the spark they have is cool. others beware some of the lameness"
1,I would rather have not ever read it,"Yes, it really IS that bad! It's a total aberration amongst a group of great books that I really love."
1,T H I S I S N O T A MYTH B O O K !,".I don't know what it is, but after reading just the excerpt it is clear that this the writing is inconsistent with previous MYTH books. I will not buy it and I refuse to acknowledge this book as part of the real MYTH series. Sorry, Robert, but you should have known better than to try to pass this off on your fans.And what the heck is up with that truly tasteless and highly inaccurate cover art?????."
3,A bit incongruous,"While I enjoyed reading this book, and have very much enjoyed reading the other Myth books, I found this book to not match well with the style of the time period in which it is supposed to take place. As the series has gone on, the universe in which it takes place has become more complicated, and we have learned about it along with Skeeve. This book is much more ""sophisticated"" in its treatment of the universe as compared to the novels which surround it.Having read the author's note, I understand his desire to become used to the myth series before he really attempts to extend it. I would opine, though, that judging by this book he has not yet re-captured the delightful playfulness and naivete that has marked the myth series. That being said, I can't wait to read the next one!"
2,A rusty return,"I used to really enjoy the Myth series by Robert Asprin but Asprin - for reasons he is rather vague about - pretty much stopped writing the books in the mid-'90s. Now, at long last, he has written another Myth book, and I feel I could have waited after all.This story, which takes place after book three in the series has Skeeve and Aahz seeking a cow that delivers golden milk. Of course, it is not that easy to get to said cow. It is a combination fantasy/western/vampire story, and it doesn't really work. The plot is okay, but the writing is weak, the characters are shallow and worst of all, it just isn't funny.I have enough loyalty to the series not to ditch it based off of one bad book, but this is not a good sign for Asprin's return. This book is for Myth fans only...all others should look elsewhere for their entertainment."
4,Not MYTH-ing anymore,"A welcome return to the great MYTH series, after a long break. When the story takes off, it is hard to put the book down - with its interesting and wacky plot. I would very much recommend this, and it is a good addition to the rest of the great MYTH series.Note: Although this is a new book, it is a 'prequel' fitting in between the plots of two earlier books."
2,"Ok, I get it. It's a joke. Who wrote this? Really?","No one talks like themselves. The three known characters involved, Skeeve, Aahz, and Tanda... they barely even ACT like themselves. Basic rules of magic (that the person who uses a disguise spell can't see it, that the sources of magic are called 'force lines') are just forgotten about. Completely. Everything sounds stilted and phony, and no one seems to want to use contractions or sound at all natural. Aahz in particular has been replaced by a poorly realized doppleganger of himself, and the interplay between the two main characters is completely spoiled.This is almost WORSE than the new ""Phule"" books, because this is supposed to be Asprin himself. I guess Asprin doesn't even know how to write Asprin books anymore.If there's another book in this series, I'm getting it at the library before I even think about buying it."
2,Thank Goodness for small favors,"I had all but given up on Mr. Asprin and his Myth crew thinking the series was getting too big for it's own good. After all, by the end of the second to the last book (I am trying very hard to forget the awful ""Sweet Myth-tery of Life"" which read more as therapy to a scorned divorcee than a Myth adventure) our Heros were so well off and had so many people working with them, there were no really tense moments. What new mountains could they climb? So it was nice to return to a time when they did not have all the answers and were struggling to make it to the end of the book. This may not have been the best addition ever but it is a good apetizer to what lies ahead. But after so many years of waiting, I'm not sure if I'm ready for the promised novel. It could bring about too many painful memories of the book it will be written around."
4,A return to the heart of the series,"Although this book is #11 in the Myth Adventures series, the story is set in time between books #3 and #4 (Myth Directions and Hit or Myth). In this book, Asprin returns to what is really the heart of the series, ""buddy"" adventures involving Skeeve and Ahz. This adventure takes them on a treasure hunt following a tricky magical map and the shifty advice of a shape shifter. They end up in Kowtow, a dimension full of spooky (and deadly) cows and some nervous humans. Skeeve and Ahz end up with more gold than you can swing a shovel at, but not everything turns out as expected. This books is a delightful break from the complicated (but interesting) storyline that emerges in Myth-ing Persons and continues over the last five books of the series."
4,Another fun romp,"It has obviously been a while since Asprin wrote for this series, but the magic is still there. It may be a bit slow in coming, but this book is another excellent addition to the series. It is certainly not the best, but it was everything I expect from Robert Asprin.I only have two small complaints. The first is that the editing was a bit poor. Misspellings were a bit distracting in a couple of places. ""Posseltum"" in particular. My other complaint is the terrible illustrations on both the cover and inside. The middle-school quality charcoal drawing did nothing but detract from the book, and why can't they ever get the cover illustrations correct. As I recall, Aahz is shorter than Skeeve, and Tananda has green skin.In any case, my only complaints are more or less nit-pics. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the rest of the series."
2,Where's the love,"While I was happy to see the Robert Asprin is back and writting the Myth series again, I would be lying if I said I was satified with this installment. While the action, adventure and humor are all still there from the previous books the heart is missing. Aahz is just plain mean. Very really to you get the feeling the he likes Skeeve. Unlike in past books where you always could tell that under Aahz's gruff and grumpy personna you could tell he really cared for Skeeve.It wasn't just Aahz none of the characters seemed the same. Still, this book was written to simply get Mr. Asprin refreshed with his characters again not to really further the series. Hopefully, he has done that and the magic will return in the next book."
5,The Ice on the cake.,"Quite difficult to get hold of in the UK but one of the most succinct of all the training volumes. Combined with something like CCNAB from Cisco Press and the Sybex CCNA Study Guide you have an unbeatable combination. As the #640-607 will cease registrations on the 30th September 2003 you have just time left to read all three, try a few labs, and take the exam. You can still take the 607 Exam within 45 days of the date above. I think it will still be a good bet for the new exam #640-801 as everything it covers will be in that exam too. Recommended!"
1,Not up to par,"I don't like taking ""Test your Knowledge"" tests, only to find the ""correct"" answers were never mentioned in the chapter. Or, the question/answer is not expressed in terms consistant with the chapter. That's extremely frustrating. It makes me wonder: Is the chapter just lame, or is the test lame? Either way, it makes me feel insecure. At the cost of $125 for the exam, I wish I had picked a better author. Chirella, wish me luck, because the book did not make me feel prepared for my test today."
3,Suffers from errors.,"I have found too many errors and contradictions in this book to recommend. I would normally overlook such errors, if they were documented appropriatedly by the publisher. Not only does the publisher not have errata pages, but my multiple emails to the publisher have been ignored.The book is small, and easy to read. Unfortunately, since it is small, many topics are not covered, or covered very briefly. If you make a mistake in your only review question on a topic, it becomes glaring.Needless to say, I will be selling my copy soon."
5,An absolute treasure,"Of all the Schiele monographs I own, this is my favourite one. I love Schiele's drawings and watercolors, I can get lost in them, mesmerized by a single casual line that defines a thigh or an arm; I love his portraits, his oils... but most of all I love his townscapes and landscapes, so this book as an absolute treasure.Great quality reproductions, wonderful b/w photographs of places/towns/buildings he painted (taken from the same perspective as they appear in his paintings).Highly recommended."
4,A good study of a lesser known Schiele,"This book is centered on a hitherto less well-known aspect of Egon Schiele's art, i.e. his landscapes. The catalogue for a 2004 exhibition held at the Leopold Museum in Vienna (the largest Schiele collection in the world), it was written by Rudolph Leopold himself (the founder of the museum and largest Schiele collector in the world). It lists most of the landscapes painted by Schiele chronologically, whether painting or drawing, and describes each of them very thoroughly. Some works which at the time (2004) were believed lost (a magnificent Krumau landscape and a beautiful sunflower painting) have since then reappeared on the art market and made headlines as they sold for record prices.The illustrations are of a good quality, even though not as perfect as the ones that grace another available book on the same subject, ""Egon Schiele's landscapes, between ruin and renewal"" which is a more literary and less purely factual work."
3,WARNING: THIS CD IS NOT ORBITAL,I ordered this CD mistakenly because I thought it was ORBITAL but it's Angel Anton. There was not much information on the page to tell me what this was. Now I have to send it back and pay for the shipping. I don't know what this is but it is NOT ORBITAL.
4,"something to consider, maybe.","so i bought this product a few months ago. there is not much in it, and i cant say it is horrible. i liked this product because it had a great scent and it worked. but, it didnt work entirely great. i mean, it COMPLETELY got rid of the odor. It just did not hide the 'puddles.'"
5,"Works okay, but smells great...","I have always been a sweater, even in the winter time when I was freezing cold, I was still sweating under my arms. When I saw this new deodorant, I tried it and was very impressed. The directions say that it is intended for application at night and that it's peak effects can be seen the following day. Well, I have used it at night and the next day, not near as much sweat as before, plus, the scent was amazing!! However, I work out in the morning so I have to shower in the morning, also, so applying it at night is not always possible, but even when I apply it in the morning, it doesn't provide as much relief from the sweating, but it keeps releasing a fresh scent all day. I see people keep writing that there is no difference between the ingredients in this clinical strength and regular deodorants, but there is something special about this clinical strength. I haven't had any underarm odor since I started using it. I am completely satisfied"
1,Doesn't Stop Sweating,I was excited to try this product but after giving it a good go that excitement turned into disappointment. I don't recommend this product if you're looking for something to stop the excess sweating. The first time I used it I applied the night before to no avail. On subsequent tries I applied the night before and again in the morning. Save your money it doesn't work!
5,Never before in history has there ever been a movie like this!,"No, really. I'm totally serious. I've never, ever seen anything like this before. They must have all been so high when they made this musical that you can get stoned just watching it.Look at it this way... If CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC was a high school, the entire cast would be the ""cool"" people who were always in DETENTION."
1,A Must See...Only Because of the Experience,"This is the ultimate in cheesy movies. Pay close attention, especially, to the YMCA scene. It has to rank as one of the greatest scenes in all-time movie history. This movie guarentees plenty of laughs, bad acting, and REALLY bad dancing (i.e. Steve ""the roller skating disco stud"" Guttenburg). So if you need cheering up for some reason or another, watch this movie."
5,Criterion candidate,The Village People's sole feature film is an irreplaceable period piece deserving consideration for preservation as a feature-added Criterion Collection DVD.
5,Can't Stop The Music,Very entertaining - brings back fond memories of that era. I think I've seen this movie a hundred times.
4,Nostalgia,Had this on tape years ago - sure beats some of the shows out there on TV.Just plain fun and a true history of the Village People who have always been different and diverse from all the others. Disco was an interesting craze and this should be saved as archival information. Especially the first song about New York City-super.
4,Sacramento VP Lover!,"Even though this movie is pretty bad, if your a ""true"" Village People fan it really won't matter. Fans whose love comes from the heart, like mine, are able to laugh at the bad stuff and really bust a gut at the ""really bad stuff."" The milkshake scene is something to laugh at!I was a shame that this movie didn't get more attention when it first came out. The VP were an icon for disco and they are still going stronger then ever today. I have never known of another group to beable to draw a crowd like they do and perform like it was the first time.I enjoyed every minute of this movie, remembering when I saw it for the first time all those years ago. It actually opened on my birthday and I used to think that they did it for me because I was their #1 fan and I still am at 32 years old. THE VILLAGE PEOLE ARE THE BEST!"
1,A Whole Cast & Crew of People Who are Completely Out of their Minds!,"Thank God that era is over! The horribly exaggerated bad acting, the awful clothes and frizzy hair. The dialogue is insane! Everyone in this movie is a dork - goofy, nerdish. Weren't there any decent choreographers in 1979 that could have advised this director? The whole thing is pure torture!"
3,"B4 Moulin Rouge,there was this movie......","Movie Musicals are a rarity nowdays. Last Year Aussie Director Baz Luhrmann brought to the screen Moulin Rouge. Rewind back to 1980 when disco group Village People , Bruce Jenner and Valerie Perrine were big names at the time. Can't Stop The Music may not be no Moulin, there is a bit of tids and bits that may be somewhat amusing. The number that REALLY stands out in comparison to the introduction of Luhrmann's opening scence of the Moulin Rouge is the ""Y.M.C.A."" number....lol. Seeing Perrine,Jenner and the Village People running thru the mens locker room will never be copied and thank goodness it never was... Another scence that is worth mentioning is the ""Milkshake"" number also. How campy singing about a milkshake would sound very catchy at the very end. Can't Stop The Music may not be a four star film but it is fun to watch once in awhile."
2,Not even bad enough to be good.,"Movieline wrote: ""Like nothing you've ever seen before.""I am not sure about that, but I am sure that it is like nothing I will ever see again. Not if I can help it.Maybe it was my own fault, because I knew that it was not the sort of film I would like. But from the reviews here, I thought I might get some camp value from it, and I was just curious. Also I was curious about how a band as obviously ""gay"" as the Village People could become so big in mainstream society. But this film reveals little if anything of that."
1,Can't stand the movie,"There are some movies so horrible that you watch them, not out of guilty pleasure but rather with the same interest as rubbernecking a 20 car pile-up on a major highway.Nothing works about this movie. It is bad, bad bad, not even Valerie Perrin can make it good. As for Bruce Jenner, what was he thinking. The rumour is that a lot of coke was used in the making of the movie, the reason, they all wanted to dull their senses it is that bad. I'm surprised anyone had a career after this."
3,"Cute, but not what I really expected...","The charm looks nice on a thin gold chain. It is very light-weight. The back of the heart is open and hollowed out.There is one thing that Amazon incorrectly described about the charm-it mentioned that it featured two simple elements, one smooth and shiny heart and one textured and glittery heart. It does NOT have another textured and glitterly heart-it is actually in the shape of a half oval or circle. That is why I gave it 3 stars because I expected it to be a heart! It would really help if there was a picture of the backside of the charm. This can really throw off buyers! It happened to me, but I'll still keep it because it looks cute..."
2,CHEAP,The picture of Kirk and Spock looks like it was printed on crapy ink jet printer. Don't waste your $$$.
4,Spectroscopy made easy,"Wybourne has written two texts on group theory. This book applies finite groups to spectroscopy. [The other, ""Classical Groups for Physicists"", deals with continous groups, and is at a much harder level of mathematics.]Ever since Eugene Wigner's classic text on the subject, it has been well served by lucid descriptions. In part because spectroscopy is one of the most practical applications of physics and chemistry. Your preparation for this book can be that of a good undergraduate grounding in either field. It helps to be very comfortable with matrix algebra and the standard notation used for it.If so, then this book may be useful. Don't worry about the publication date. At the level of this book, you are dealing in understanding the concepts and how to apply them. If you can handle the material in the book, then you might need a more recent text only to show how to implement it in computer code, or to use existing software packages."
5,Love it,I read this book twice already. It was delievered fast and I am very happy with the book. I have about 12 of these books and I can not wait to put them in order and read them.
5,Great Book,"I have always loved ""For Better or for Worse"". This was just another great book for my collection."
4,If You Liked Power Stone...,"If you liked Power Stone (or your kids did) this is a game you will want to add to your library. You'll like the new, sometimes bizarre weapons which add a slightly demented but fun quality to the experience. It's bazile. Get it."
2,If you love words words words this is it ...,"This book was strange to say the least. I have read some of Hendens other books but I think here he was getting paid by the word....If you love Bronte or jane Austen then youll probably also love this book cause the author went out of his way to muddle the erotic scenes with strange strange thoughts .... By strange I mean flighty not erotic ...Not my taste ,as you can tell, in erotic lit ...."
5,It could of been better,This small collection of great songs is a small step in the right direction to redress the lack of attention this great rocker and his band have gotten over the last few years! MCA needs to get it together and release the rest of the music Donnie made for them. ...
4,Got this for Leah.,"But I enjoy the rest of the songs! Donnie Iris doesn't look like a typical rock and roller, but this is a good album!"
1,Bait & Switch,The author(s) decided that the premise which underlay all the previous books in the series was invalid and tried to convince the reader to that end. Imho they failed. BADLY. They failed to convice me that the prior premise was wrong and their accounting of the designtergration of the society was lame. Ignore this book and read the rest of series instead.
5,Too bad it had to end ...,"Very like the ongoing saga of HH ( Honor Harrington ) by David Weber, this was a great series all the way along. It must be difficult coming up with bigger and better things for a character that feels fully developed, but I do wish they had found something!Unlike the other reviewer, I found the accent of one of the main characters a *fantastic* touch. Yes, it takes a while to get used to it, but this characters seems more alive / real to me because of it. It was easy to ""see"" this character in my mind. So I appreciated the extra work that must have gone into creating the accent.Overall the entire series is a wonderful, fun read. Not to say it's lighthearted, but it is a breath of fresh air. Much like the David Gemmel books. The characters are easy to get attached to, and the story has a depth that can be expanded upon at a later date, if the author / publisher / fans feel like keeping this universe going."
2,Useless,Outdated information. They even mention that computers could go a long way toward making growing in greenhouses run better. Too bad I had high hopes for this book.Maybe someone could get some use out of this book but I couldn't.
5,book,"The book was just what I needed, Thanks will come back for more products from, ordering from amazon has saved a lot of money."
2,Shmock rock,When did anyone related to such awesome bands as hot snakes and Red Aunts attempt to put out such dung. outrageous shmock rock... Cheesy and lousy.It might do you well when trying to impress your date by putting on some thoroughly obscuro ... and claiming its your best friend in LA's finest work to date.... ....
2,Postage/shipping,"way too high for the price of this product, will not order this way again. Does't have any benefit to order this way."
4,A great book!,"A great book about history, religion, sports, and anything you could possibly imagine. My favorite book."
3,Hillside dilema,As most Sunset books - this one does a good job. Lots of pictures and a detail section for retaining walls and steps. Very broad. I found most the pictures too small to get a good sense of the area they represent. I would recommend if you need some ideas and info to get grounded on how to approach.
4,Nice color,Nice color of potholder and good quality. I wish more came in a package. Washes up nicely and arrived on time.
1,THE DREADED H03........has struck again!,Less than a year later....my LS-50 has succumbed to the H03 errorcode....Panasonic deserves a class action law suit! DO NOT BUYTHIS PLAYER...
1,Darn H03 error code,"I too had problems with the error code. First time was 8 month after purchase, got it fixed for over $100.00. 6 months later the same error popped up. What is Panasonic doing about this? I am sceptical about purchasing any Panasonic product from now on and am spreading the word on this problem. I will am going to call the company and see if I can get some type of refund for the product."
2,H02 code fixable,"We were given this model by a friend and it has saved many car/airplane rides for our 4 year old daughter. The unit is now 4 years old and has been functioning fine until last week when we received an H02 code. I read all of the reviews below and we were able to fix it by doing the following:1) turn the machine on2) remove any disc from player3) hold down 3 buttons simultaneously (backskip/pause/play) until the following sign appears on the screen ""initialized""4) turn machine off5) turn machine back on again, insert disc and try againIt worked well for us and took a total of 1 minute to fix. Not sure if it will happen again but we'll at least be able to squeeze another car trip out of it!"
1,broke,"I bought this the end of November of 2004 for Christmas. It lasted 6 months and then I got the HO3 code, ""can't read disc"". I sent it back to Panasonic who wants $100 for replacement even though it's still under warranty because ""parts and labor"" warranty is only 90 days. I'll never buy another Panasonic product again. This unit is not inexpensive and to have it last less than 1 year is unacceptable."
5,Great for long flights,"We purchased this DVD player prior to returning to Asia, where we currently reside. We got it for my 18 month old. It worked great. He won't watch regular TV, only the Wiggles or Sesame Street. He also won't wear the headphones we got to go with it, but we were able to keep the sound at a level where he could hear but our fellow passengers could not. We cross the Pacific 2-3 times a year and this will be the indespensible item in the toy/activity bag."
2,"Very short ""shelf-life""","During the 3 months that I was able to use it, the player was well worth the investment. However, during the viewing of a DVD, an on-screen error message appeared and the player stopped. The manual provided a ""solution"" which did not work, and tech assistance would only give me locations for service. It is now in for repairs, and of course, the 90 day warranty for labor was invalid by about a week when the problem happened. Awaiting for a final cost estimate. Based on all the positive reviews (particularly @ the Circuit City site), I made the purchase. Now, it may have been a poor decision."
4,Perfect for the plane or long drives,"I did a lot of research before I purchased this unit. I was afraid of the off brand models after reading some reviews and decided to stick with a name I recognized. The Panansonic LS50 had good reviews from experts and end users so I went with it and was not dissapointed. The picture is good, controls are fairly easy to use and with medium screen brightness you can get about 2.5 hrs of video before the battery runs down. Right now Circuit City has an $80 rebate and Panasonic has a rebate for a free airline adapter and travel case. Hurry if your in the market!"
1,Broken down H03 code,I bought this player over a year ago based on the great reviews it got. It worked up until yesterday. Now I too have the dreaded H03 code and the player has died.
2,Too expensive for one year of entertainment value,"All I can say is that my dvd player is now a little more than one year one and it BROKE. The dvd player won't play at all. Of course, this player had to break down as one month after the warranty. So much for the Panasonic quality. I'm very disappointed and needless to say I'm going to buy a different brand from now on."
1,DREADED h03 Error Strikes Again - on a newer model.,"I am so glad to read everyone else's reviews about this H03 error. I have a newer Panasonic DVD player, LS90 model fully equipped with all the bells and whistles. Luckily I also purchased the extended warranty from Best Buys. I first got this H03 error message 3 weeks ago and took this DVD player to Best Buys. Did not have to pay a dime to get it fixed but went without it for 2 weeks. They told me all they did was clean it and that it was working fine after the cleaning. One day after getting it back from repair, the H03 Error started up again! I am printing out all these other reviews about the H03 error code and taking it to Best Buys to see if they will just exchange it for me. I do not believe that I'll be buying Panasonic again - and definitely not without the extended warranty."
1,Error code H03 requires replacement with reconditioned unit.,"I was disappointed to learn that my DVD player had only a 90 warranty on labor. For no reason error code H03 appeared requiring me to send the unit to McAllen Texas for service. The service center informed me it would be $90.00 plus S&H for a remanufactured unit. The unit was only six months old and probably had less than 100 hours on it. I purchased Panasonic paying a $100 dollars more than other similarly equipped models hoping to avoid this type of issue. The unit performed nicely during its short life, I hope I get more mileage from the replacement."
1,"It can happen to you, too!",I got this portable DVD player for my birthday in Jan 05 in August of 05 I got the DREADED BUT ALL TOO REAL Code H03. Used it only a few times. Wrote to Panasonic's customer service . . . no response yet. Will think twice before buying Panasonic again.
1,Worthless warranty,Given as a Christmas gift the player stopped working in April. Wish I'd read the fine print. Only 90 days warranty on labor. Returned to Panasonic per the instructions. Their solution - another $100 to replace with a reconditioned unit. $100 versus $300 for new? I'll replace the player but it won't be a Panasonic.
1,Not reliable,"We bought this unit for long distance travel in the car and have used it approximatly 5x. Initially, very pleased with performance. However, after 1 year of very low usage, the motor completely died. The kids were using it for several hours for about three times on two consectutive days. Then it just stopped running. Very disappointed with Panasonic, esp. since we stayed away from lesser known brands and were hoping for better quality product. This will now have us buying product from another manufacturer in the future."
1,ho3 error on four panasonics,Between my sister and I we have owned 4 panasonic portables dvd players - all came up with the ho3 error message. I will never buy again and I will tell everyone not to buy one!
2,H03 error & solution,"Got this error on my Panasonic Portable DVD and did a google search to see what came up... found all these reviews. Very helpful, thanks folks! The trick with the back skip, pause and play buttons (three or four reviews below) works a treat (at least for now!). Certainly beats a call to Panasonic who sound less than helpful judging by previous reviews. Fingers crossed..."
2,Poor Quality or Bad Engineering,"For the price I expected a better built product. I unpacked the unit and thought to myself that I better hold onto the receipt.... within 24 hours the screen went nearly black. Not sure why, I was running the unit off a car adapter AC Power Supply. We shut off the car while the player was in pause, and it never recovered... I would think that a portable unit should be able to handle interupted power supply issues.. As far as I'm concerned, its Junk. We'll be returing it Monday."
3,Great Product-Horrible Batteries,"I have absolutely no difficulties with the product, it is wonderful. Finding batteries for it on the other hand is a nightmare. The shorter two hour baterries are simple to find, but I still have not found the longer life ten hour battery for this product. Without the ten hour battery you would be lucky to get through one dvd, so without it the LS50 loses it's appeal."
1,Huge waste of money,"I've read many reviews concerning this particular model, and I have to say most of them were horrible. I wish I read these reviews before making a purchase. The ""H03"" error code seems to be a recurring trend. I've only had mine for about 2 months and the thing crapped out on me! Apparently this is a defect for this model. I do not recommend buying this. Sure it looks nice and the picture quality is pretty good, but for the price and the lifespan of the DVD player, it is just not worth it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,Self destructed in 7 months,"Too bad for me that the warranty expires after six! The product has a defect that tech support admitted to, but I got absolutely no help, mercy or customer service from the Panasonic company. They demanded one third of its original price for me to send it to Texas to have it fixed!After YEARS of buying Panasonic products, they just lost another customer."
1,too bad it didn't last very long,I loved this DVD player until the dreaded H03 error occured and now it doesn't work. Based on the other bad reviews I read I am now going to have to send it to Texas and pay another $100 dollars to fix it. It really is a bummer since I could have bought the cheap player and thought that I'd get more for my money.
1,Beware of good reviews -- dreaded H03 error is REAL!,"Please be wary of the ""good"" reviews. They are people who just bought the product and haven't had much experience with it. I have experience with the product.I bought my player 4 months ago and loved it, at first. But this morning I too got the dreaded H03 error. And...I can't do a darn thing about it.Normally, I'd return it under warranty repair and pay my $90. But, I'm sitting in Iraq right now, without my receipt to ""prove"" when I purchased it. I can't even pick up the phone and call Panasonic because I'll be on hold more than the 15 minutes I'm allotted weekly, like I'll use those precious phone calls for them versus my family. And I could pay the money and it still happen again in another 4 months while I'm here...So I'm stuck with it -- be aware, so it doesn't happen to you too. I'm ordering another brand today and being done with it....So Panasonic...you're messing with the troops now too! And I'm mad!"
5,Worth the listen,"My curiousity was well rewarded when I first listened to these four CDs. The symphonic music is seamlessly recorded, accented with tone notations that are easy on the ear and peaceful on the mind. This set is at the office, on the iPod and the home computer, and loaned to others on a regular basis. They have flavored prayer services and supported pastoral conversations. Make good presents, too. Worried about subliminal suggestion? Well, if clearer thinking and thoughtful reflection is subliminal thinking, then you will get the message each time you listen to these recordings. Other recordings by Dr. Thompson deliver just as these do."
4,Good Music,"I really like the classical music on all but the delta cd. This one is supposed to be for sleep but I find it sinister and annoying, but the rest of the cds are good."
2,Disappointed,"While the classical music was nice, I didn't notice any effects that helped me sleep, relax, or energize."
4,Track Listing,Track Listing1. Living In Danger (Single Edit) 3:102. Living In Danger (Old School Mix - Short Version by David Morales) 3:393. Living In Danger (D-House Mix - Long Version by David Morales) 10:034. Living In Danger (New Buddha Version) 3:365. Living In Danger (For The Big Clubs Mix by Armand Van Helden) 10:15
4,Good but....,"This is a very informative book on horses. It is very detailed and technical. The pictures are excellent but very graphic. I bought this book for my daughter who's ten and ""horse crazy"". I thought it would be a good start to her collection but it's too mature(the life cycle etc.)This is geared more to a more mature audience."
4,Very Descriptive Book,"This book was a very good book. It went very deep in a lot of different subjects. The book describes many different breeds, what they are used for, where they originated, how tall they can get, how much they can weigh, and the usual care for that breed of a horse.Also written about in this book is the different sports and events that a horse can be used for. It also goes deeply into the ancient history of the horse.I definetly recommend this book to horse lovers and anybody that is really interested in learning more about horses then it would be very great to read, but if you are more into the medical aspect of the horse then this is really not the book for you it really does not go into any depth with medicine. But other than that is is awesome."
3,An Accurate but some-what Useless Book,"A reference collection of the main types, breeds, and colors of horses. It also includes a slight history of the horse. Each page contains a different breed and some basics about it. The information is correct and well-written, but I don't see a real use for the book unless you are merely curious about many different breeds of horses and wish to compare them."
5,"The definitive ""must read"" background book on Venice.","This book (titled Venice in the UK) was first published in 1960 under the byline of James Morris, when its English author was a foreign correspondent living in Italy. The current edition's seamless blend of history, social commentary, and personal travel narrative make it essential reading for anyone with a serious interest in Venice. - Durant Imboden, Venice for Visitors, http://govenice.miningco.co"
1,A dreadful reading experience,"... I read [this] book prior to a week-long trip to Venice. This book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives. It is a poor ""guidebook"" and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue--to quote Simon: ""Abysmal with a capital A."" The history and art of Venice are covered better in books from those genres. The only upside is that it is short. Yuck, what a waste of time. My advice is: get a novel about Venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book. At least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails. Actually, in terms of a travelogue, ""Vendela in Venice"" far surpassess any other Venice book I have seen. Although I originally bought it because it is considered a children's book, it is not dumbed down at all and adults will enjoy it..."
4,A really interesting idea...,"Its a very interesting idea and a really great book. I could see something like that happening if the science was there...all hatred and seperate groups etc. The in the 2nd part of the book where society on Earth is divided into Donkeys (who do the work)and ""Livers"" (who live a life of leisure) ...descriptions of how the Livers live were really kind of amusing.Overall..I really enjoyed it and it kept me up late. However, as some other people have pointed out, the character of Leisha Camden was a little..well, flat. I really liked her in the first half of the book then at the 2nd half she was just kind of there..and so what. I really liked the character Miri though, cared what happened to her and the descriptions of the supers and how they thought was cool. And it was cool how the tables turned at the end."
1,"Soap Opera, not Sci-Fi","The novel started out okay, but then turned into a sister to sister relationship story. I wanted more sci-fi and less soap opera. I tossed it about half-way through."
1,Great Idea Marred by Infantile Style,"This novel has such a great premise but is unreadable due to the lousy writing. From the critical and reader reviews I thought Beggars in Spain would be the work of a top literary stylist; instead, it's the work of a rank amateur. The dialog is especially bad. Granted, the book starts out from an infant's POV, so I didn't throw it across the room until page 100, at which point the main character was a fully grown woman. Too bad the author's style didn't mature with her character."
4,For some... not others,"I'm not really a sci-fi fan, but a friend of mine bought it for me because he knew that I'll read just about anything. For me, personally... this book was okay. I felt as if some parts dragged on... the last 1/4 of the book I found really interesting. In conclusion, I think this book would appeal more to some people than others."
2,disappointing,"I purchased this book in Spain... Besides this curiosity, I must say I really wanted to read this book after reading some reviews, however it slightly disappointed me. It is a good book though, but to me it was very plain and simple. I thought it would have deeper characters but i find them to be pretty simple and not much realistic. The story looks to me rather unrealistic too, the events and actions that happen.. i'd never think they could really happen. I was expecting something that would have some ""philosophical implications"", or let's say something that would make you think about it, but there was none of this.I would say it's like a long tale, but a tale nevertheless."
1,Drivel.,"Character development: poor to nil. Plot: Vague and unfocused. There's no reason to care what happens to any of the characters or to their world. Writing style was stilted, uninspired. Give this one a miss."
1,watered-down ayn rand,Really - this was a very boring book. All exposition. If you want to read about the trials and trevails of beautiful perfect happy people with no interest in the complexities of human culture -- then I recommend it.
2,A bit boring,"No plot spoilers here. Look at the 5 star reviews for a good summary.A good chunk of the book involves the legal battle of the sleepless. Way too much in fact.Major contradiction (in my mind): if the sleepless are so super intelligent, why make casual references to their following of religions? Why mention 12 times that one character is wearing her abaya (Muslim headscarf) if there is no discussion about relgion at all?Too many minor characters are introduced.Oh! the main character - just hangs out on earth for decades, not doing much of anything except maybe trying to form relationships with her sister's family.I would give this book 1 star.....but the beginning is quite good."
4,Classic futuristic story,I love reading about our future and considering how close we are to actually picking the genetics of our children makes this book even that more engaging!
5,Who are the Beggars? Multiple answers.,"I loved this book for its deep thought about genetic modifications of human beings while portraying them as real people, something that science fiction often dosn't do well. This was my first introduction to Nancs Kress. I am now a fan."
5,Surprised by nature of criticisms.,"I figured this book would have critics, but I thought they'd criticize the dysfunctional family aspect, the fact that it works with fairly old themes, the somewhat political nature, or the Americentricness. Although I'd agree the last half seemed sort of implausible & incongruitous with the first half. Regardless I really liked it the line ""Alice is special"" really stuck with me. Also it's nice to read a book with a rational woman in it. I hate to say this, but women authors seemed to have abandoned the idea women can be rational & bash reason as a ""patriarchalist"" value. Of course rationalism is mildly bashed in this book & I don't think it's enough to get by in life. Also the people were more real then in most sf, strangely the fact you only got glimpses of who they were is more true to life. Oh, by the way Kress recently married hard sf author Charles Sheffield"
2,Not so much,"Too many loose ends. Poor story line. Maybe a sequel could tie it all together, but this one left me baffled."
4,Another good reading,"I thought it was kind of scary. The thought of men creating better men... and those better men creating an even better one... wo, major wo. I liked the science part... the fiction part is OK. There is a part where the book becomes a little slow, but afterwards you cannot stop. Overall: a good book."
4,Worthy successor to Huxley,"Nancy Kress's BEGGARS IN SPAIN, is, IMO, the best SF novel of its kind since BRAVE NEW WORLD. Certainly it's one of the most thoughtful to tackle the subject of DNA manipulation in humans in many years. Her eye for story + character is wonderful, as well as for the large & small details of her future world. I'd recommend this SF novel to people who don't usually like the genre. She covers the subject matter much more thoroughly & realistically than the film GATTACA, which owes more than a little to the sibling-rivalry theme in this book."
2,Failing to add interest to ambition,"When I read this book, I was impressed by Kress's ambition to tackle a sweeping series that extrapolate the future of human culture, in the grand tradition of classic writers such as Aasimov. Unfortunately, in my eyes she fails. The characters read to me like the typical product of soap opera, and the plot is at least as old as comic books - guilty-feeling people with superpowers and the sullen normal folk who resent them. Can anybody find happiness when they're perfect? Do I care?"
1,"calm, hot and biting","Found Colm Heaney while looking for any versions of ""Dancing in the Moonlight"", and here it was. I never heard of this Dublin based singer/songwriter. The sound is kind of pop, but surprisingly with a bite that shows you this guy has the sound coming from his heart. I would give it a try and give it to a friend, you won't regret it."
5,Neo-Classical Rock,A must have CD for every sophisticated Rock musician. If Bach was still alive he would make this type of music. Very profound instrumental and choral arrangements.
4,Angel Heart,Very beautiful item. It is ALOT smaller than pictured. The size should be mentioned. It is a very beautiful and has made a great gift for my grandmother.
1,Old Ideas.,"I got my hands on a copy and the quality was very poor. The DVD is nothing more than a home video of her cat using the toilet. Youtube etc has her movie footage on it.The content of the DVD can be found for free, on the well-known Internet group forums offering Cats' T-Training etc. Search yahoo or google it in. Vendor offers no support or troubleshooting for problems where as the big forum groups do, also for free!Seller uses the turkey roaster for a litter pan. A pan is flimsy and the cat's body weight causes the aluminum to bend and snap. The cat is spooked and never goes near the toilet again. Sharp edges are a hazard to the cat's paws and small children. Her concept to tape the pan to the toilet seat means if you don't have a spare toilet, you have to un-tape the pan when humans want to use it. The method is as old as using the plastic wrap- also unsuccessful.Essentially, with a little browsing you could pick up a better way to train your cat and the cost would be FREE.NUNYA"
4,the I wish I knew book,This is a very good book set and yes its dated but that is what made it easy to understand. My outdated brain could understand the basic ideas presented here which allowed me to understand the more modern versions of the subjects discussed in the book. At the very least it is a pleasant read.
1,lawrence welk 9,The tape was no good. It would not work. I will not be ordering any more and I don't like wasting time to write this.
5,What every CNE needs,"Server magic can change partitons, move data, all in simple steps. Easy to use. A real time saver. No Novell shop should be without this software."
3,Nice looking - but leaks,Very Nice looking cover - but it's not waterproof. After it rains there's a lot of water on the tabletop underneath. Not exactly what you want in a table cover. I even sprayed it thoroughly with Scotchguard and that didn't help much.
1,Bad Advertising,"The dimensions provided in this ad are very confusing. Don't know how anyone can make any sense of them. This cover will only fit a six foot round table. The seller could have easily provided this information. I returned my cover and the only concern the seller had was that I return it in a way they could resell it. No mention of return postage, etc. Very dissatisfied with how this was presented and of the sellers comments and concerns when returning the same."
4,Better then expected,"I got this for my parents, they were worried about their table. I had it sent to them. They called up thrilled about how good it works. They said it was very good quality, and didn't blow off in a storm. I haven't seen it yet, but they are happy customers."
4,I should have purchased this years ago!!,I have a deck outside and this protects the table and chairs from whatever winter brings it. Snow and ice were beginning to wear out the slate top.....and this solves a problem! Was pleased with the sturdy fabric and ease of installment. The elastic keeps it firmly in place.......Would buy it again!
3,Didn't work for us,"The patio table cover arrived exactly as described, and it fit our table perfectly. Unfortunately, after coming home from a December vacation, we found a foot of snow directly on the table and the cover on the ground, buried in snow. I guess it had blown off while we were gone. So, it is sort of useless, and we ended up moving our table into our storage area, and the cover is in a pile in the garage. If you can't move your furniture inside, I suggest weighting the cover or tying it down on the bottom."
5,Patio Table Cover,"I was thrilled to FINALLY find a cover for our patio table! Every year we've searched the stores and been either too late or too early, OR they just didn't carry them. Meanwhile our old cover was cracked and hardly serving its purpose. Our son said, try the Internet, and since I've dealt with Amazon before and always been very satisfied with the company and the product, I tried you. AND as in the past, I was able to find the perfect item, it was shipped in a very timely manner, came fully intact and was EXACTLY what we wanted. Thanks Amazon, another job well done!!!Sincerly,Mrs. P.C. Radiotis"
5,Zara's Tales: Perilous Escapades in Equatorial Africa,This book is a fantastic journey and inspires the adventuresome spirit. A beautiful sharing of a unique life.
5,Andre Rieu - Romantic Paradise,"An absolutely fabulous DVD, the music brought me close to tears with the sheer beauty of it."
5,Excellent overview for a complete SCM newbie,"I picked up this book because we recently started a project where management uses the term ""SCM"" a lot, and I had no real idea of what that means. This book provides a great overview of the ideas and genesis of SCM, and why it is useful. It also provided lots of detail and examples about the ideas presented to really cement them in my mind, and translate them to activities that we currently do. I can have an intelligent, scientific conversation about SCM now, which is exactly what I was looking for. This book is really excellent."
3,25 good tunes but not the best sound quality,"This was one of the first CDs I used to build my deejay file. I've used several of the tracks, but had to do some editing to clean up the sound. For some tunes, I chose other sources. If I were starting to build my file anew, I would probably choose even fewer tracks from this CD.There are no liner notes.The choice of tunes is very good. It's mostly from the pre-rock era. Those from the rock era are more easy listening, and there are a couple country crossover hits.On the CD tags (as seen on the computer when I set up to rip), most of the tracks are not identified."
5,Inspiring,The powerful and inspiring way that the Divine Name is pronounced is capable if you mantain your state of receptivity to Be One with Him Again.
5,Happy,"I love this cookbook. Great recipes that are both EASY and delicious. I have made several of the receipts and all were wonderful. I have purchased several since for gifts for family, friends and teachers!"
5,An excellent introduction to the compassion of Schweitzer.,"Albert Schweitzer (along with Joseph Campbell) should be required reading for all. No one says it better than Schweitzer and there are so many gems in this book. It is a small book which you can open to any page and read a paragraph or two. It is broken into small segments with wonderful pictures. Schweitzer lived his message. ""We must realize that all life is valuable and that we are united to all life. From this knowledge comes our spiritual relationship with the universe"" - Albert Schweitzer. Buy ten and pass them on!"
4,Good pads - but shipped poorly,Great OEM brake pads but they were shipped in a plastic bag and could have easily been damaged. Thankfully these were not but just a heads up! Otherwise great product!
3,D-Sides Review,"Put simply, D-Sides is Gorillaz' third studio album. I was really excited when I heard that D-Sides was available in November, but like some people, when I first heard D-Sides, that excitement fizzled out into a bite-size scintilla of enthusiasm.D-Sides simply lacks the enthusiasm of other Gorillaz albums.No doubt 68 State is a great intro, but tracks like People and Murdoc is God slowly kill the satisfaction of the listener.However, D-Sides does have its shining moments. Tracks like We Are Happy Landfill, Hong Kong, Rockit, and Stop the Dams are such moments.I would not discourage a Gorillaz fan to buy D-Sides, but I would warn them that it may not be what is normally expected out of our favorite cartoon band.Although I have to say the remixes on disc two really aren't that great.(Excepting DARE remix {Jr. Sanchez remix} and Dirty Harry {Schtung Chinese New Year Remix})"
2,I wish I could say it was better...,"I've been a staunch Gorillaz fan since the first album, and have loved (and purchased) nearly everything they've put out. In my opinion, Demon days was the best album of 2005. That being said, this collection of B-sides is really below the bar that was set by its predecessor. A few of the new tracks are pretty catchy, the demo version of 'Don't Get Lost In Heaven"" especially, but for the most part it's all fluff. The remixes are even more unremarkable, and in some cases just downright annoying. Though it's nice that they're giving you 13 new tracks on top of the 9 remixes, this album isn't song for song as worth your money as the B-side collection (G-Sides) that followed the first album, even though it only contained a handful of new songs. Even for hardcore Gorillaz fans, D-Sides is really a stretch, and should be purchased only by those concerned with completing their CD library."
5,Love this cd!,Gorillaz D-Sides is a great collection of songs and remixes that will rock your sound system - great value and I really liked it.
4,good deal,one of their beet cd's not saying much. but it has many versions of their best songs which make it worth it
1,,"I remember ordering Revenge's demo ""Attack, blood, revenge"" a few years back and thinking how their style of blasting war metal was unlistenable, but passable for a band that was just starting out. This is my next encounter with this band, and things haven't changed much, which isn't really surprising. I've learned that there has to be a level of memorability in a record that will make me want to play it over and over again. But like Sadistik Execution, who actually bore me to death, Revenge relies on speed to make its point across. The execution is tight, but really how long can one stand hearing an overwhelming amount of non-stop blasts and monotonous riffs? Luckily, this is only 28 minutes long. But still, after listening to such a record, you feel like you have just been through a hostile, adverse environment and usually that would be a complement to a metal band, but not in this case."
4,New Old Sound,"I love the fact that the sound this album generates is a total tribute to the band's influences and originality. In an time of every ""alternative radio"" song being based on someone's dark social views or anti-social skills, this album is a welcome change. Cowboy Song, Angels in my Room, Broken Receiver and Ultimatum all stay with you even after one listen. This album has great melodies and thought provoking lyrics, I think I'll pop it back in now... '"
5,"Great book, true story","This is the true story about a man who grew up with crime, and became a syndicated criminal. But when he sees one of Billy Graham's speeches, he decides to turn his life around to christianity. The onyl problem is, he has to say that to the mob."
3,"its alright, but aint great","i have this vest, its ok but the pistol holders break easy, at least one of them did. it blocks pretty good, i let me bro borrow my 350 fps shotgun to play airsoft, and i could barely feel the shots.note: only reason this is in kid's review is because i have this but i purchased it in a different account."
1,lol this thing,this is the worst thing in the world i don want to call it a vest the protection is terrible and if you get hit with a 370 or higher fps the plastic inside will break i got this thing with a gun but it is the same exact thing plz save the money buy something else
5,the band of the nineties,"Okay..I guess the phrase ""the band of the nineties"" is starting to become a little overused. =] Anyway...this was the first Fatboy Slim CD that I bought, and I LOVED IT! I heard ""The Rockafeller Skank"" long before it became so extremely popular, and I immediately bought this CD when it came out. The other songs are just as cool and they're filled with non-stop beats. People complain that this isn't really techno, but who cares? It's better than most."
5,"An exciting, eclectic mix of electronica, funk and hip hop.","The meshing of diverse musical styles keeps you in suspense throughout. Every tune is unique and solid in its own right. While there isn't a single ""skip over"" tune on the album, ""Right Here, Right Now"" is by far my favourite. (I listen to it at least three times before moving on to the next track.)Fatboy's ryhthmic concotions will make you high - especially at high volumes. If I lose my lease, I will only have Fatboy to blame!!!"
5,IT DESERVES 10 STARS!!!!,THIS CD IS THE BEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE!!! It is a feel good CD that should be enjoyed by everyone. People that gave this CD less than 5 stars should really get some taste! A MUST BUY!
3,A Solid Party Album,"When I first heard this, I thought it was a masterpiece and a classic dance record. It truly impresses at first, given that it has a lot of catchy and appealing tunes. However, the more I listened to it the more repetitive and boring it became. Yes, Fatboy Slim (or Norman Cook if you prefer) realy knows what he`s doing, and he certainly is one of the best in the big beat genre, but most of these songs are way too formulaic to deserve classic status, even if they truly impress at first. Sure, this is an enjoyable record with some stunning moments (""Right Here, Right Now"", ""Love Island"", ""You`re Not From Brighton"") and it`s a great choice for a party, still for a home listening it`s a bit too much, becoming annoying and irritating at parts. For a mainstream electronica album it`s quite a strong effort, containing plenty of impressive and addictive samples, but it`s not as great as some claim it to be.Fun and entertaining."
3,"Fun album, not great.","I bought this album after Better Living Through Chemistry and I was a bit disappointed. The album is still worth the money, but I was surprised at how Fatboy Slim changed between his albums. Something about this one seemed to mainstream-pop and not as much techno. I don't like most techno, but songs like Praise You are to common for me. The hightlights on this album are definetly Acid and Love Island. Those tracks are great. I still recomend it, but don't expect the same Fatboy."
5,this CD made me love this kind of music i want to hear more,"this cd is the one CD on the rack that is never there it is always in my player i LOVE this CD my friends do too i just don't like one song ""in Heaven"" it is stupid but other then that it is the awesomest CD in the world"
1,Disappointment of the year!,"I expected a lot more from this album. Maybe it just ain't my type of music. I just does nothing for me.... The single's OK, but that's about it. And the stuff just carries on forever!"
2,Not My Favorite Techno,"I only have a couple techno cds and this is one of them. It's not my favorite one. I bought it after I heard Praise You on Now 2 and Rockafellar Skank on the radio. I found it good but hard to listen too. There are some songs that are just great and really easy to listen to like Right Here, Right Now, The Rockafellar Skank, In Heaven, Gangster Trippin', and Praise You. The rest are hard to listen to. I like Eiffel 65 and Alice Deejay better."
2,Silly,"Bad pop. One half decent track and too many with no soul. No complexity, no blood, no love, no magic. Paper thin pop junk. Very disappointing for the discriminating listener."
5,I'd give it 100 stars if I could!,"If you like dance tunes, there is one CD you should buy, You've Come a Long Way, Baby. This is a wonderful CD. Even though the songs are a little lengthy(Rockafeller Skank is 7 min, 21 sec long), there is a lot of groovieness packed into it. It has everything from the blown-out speaker sound in Love Island to the radio broadcast at the end of Right Here, Right Now. But what's with ""Ooh Ooh"" in Soul Surfing? A little annoying, but it's funny. Illin in Heaven has got some major bass lines. A must have for....EVERYONE!"
1,Hands down the WORST album of all time!!!,"I'm leaning towards Fatboy Slim as the worst band ever. its the most godawful crap ever to be recorded. it is my theory that this is a joke by the member(S) to try to see how bad music could be and still make money. they probably laugh at their fans every day. from the crappy title all the way to the endlessly mindless and repetitive songs, and the pointless ""lyrics"", just hearing this makes me physically SICK. if i could give it no stars i would. This should be cast into the pit of Hell!"
2,Better stuff out there,"Norman Cook a.k.a. Fatboy Slim is good at a couple of things. First, he has a wicked sense of humour and anyone who has seen the non-US cover to this album or the Spike Jonez-directed clip to 'Praise You' will know what I mean. Second, he is good at taking other people's sounds and making commercial hits out of them. Anyone who is a relative newcomer to breakbeat will find this CD refreshing and new, but older fans will find it too derivative of old-skool Chemical Brothers and Beasties: only 'Right Here Right now' offers something different. For sure, try it before you buy, but also give 'Gatecrasher Discotech' and BT's 'Movement in Still Life' a listen. I have a feeling that these are where the future of dance music lies, whereas the Fatboy seems to be stuck in the past."
4,Purty Darn Kewl,"FBS has been one of my favorite artists since I got ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" in 1997. ""You've come a long way baby"" show FBS's versatilty as an artist. Its a great disc, and if you don't have it, well, you should get it right now. As for the people whining about 6 words being repeated over and over, there are other songs on this cd that one could listen to, besides, what kinda idiot listens to DJ music for the lyrics?"
2,see heres the thing,"the thing is, is that i REALLY LOATHE THIS CD, but the first song (right here, right now) is like one of my FAVORITE SONGS, so im glad i got the cd and i also deeply regret buying it. IT IS VERY BAD TECHNO but i dooo reeeeallly like that one song............go figure"
2,Good but Overrated,"Yeah yeah, i know it's way too late to review this album,I am 1 and half year late. Please remember this, time can prove the worth of everything and it was a year for Mr Zoe Ball in 1998. Sadly, 'the now sound of the future' is no longer the 'now sound of the phuture', it's year 2000 and i believe many people are beginning to search for a new genre of music that really belongs to the 21st century. Unfortunately/Fortuately, the sound is not the so-called big beat, there is no such thing as Big Beat basically, the sound of Fat Boy Slim is clearly from the palette of Chemical Brothers and a long of Breakbeat artists. Y can't they be famous just becoz they dun have the Celebrity Skin?"
5,perfect - why don't you have it yet??,"every time i listen to it, it sounds new. you've got to turn up the volume full blast, you've got to buy this cd. fatboy slim's beats have only gotten better over time."
4,Right about now... the funk soul brotha,"One damn good album. I'm so happy I bought this. From the Rockafeller Skank's crazy sound-sampling and the background ""twanging"" of wipe out, to In Heaven's insulting but hilarious sound, this album scores big.Although I can't listen to it all the way through (it's just too damn repetitive), I can play maybe 5 or 6 tracks back anytime, and put a smile on my face. A good showing for the FatBoy."
5,This Album is sweat!!!,I really cant say enough about this album and its mix of styles. Fatboy does a great job of making you want to move your body and feel good about music. Kudos to the release of an edited version of the original that takes out the outlandish use of a certain four letter word You WILL like this album
3,Only for those serious about techno music,"First, I would like to emphasize that if you are not familiar with the dance/techno genre, there is a good chance that this album is not for you. I purchased this album based on the radio/music video play of ""Rockerfeller Skank"", ""Gangsta Trippin'"", and ""Praise You"", and based on Internet sound clips. I expected this album to be full of the hooks demonstrated in those three songs. Although the hooks are present, the album becomes rather monotonous after awhile. Most tracks are five repetitive minutes. This album is probably best used as background music, such as when you are on the Internet or in the shower, or, of course, as it was originally intended: to dance to. It is not the album that you ""just sit down and listen to"", unless you want to absorb the shock value of ""In Heaven"". This third track is the reason this album has a parental advisory."
4,Not just any DJ,"The Prodigy opened my eyes to electronic music with Firestarter but I have to say that Norman Cook is one of the best DJs around. He has no repetitive beats because of the fact he doesn't use drum machines or computers but mainly just turntables and mixers. Many Prodigy tracks obviously sound like it's just some dude pressing buttons (see songs like ""Poision"") but Fatboy actually has changing tunes. This is album is some of the best I've ever heard."
5,Awesome,"Fatboy Slim, I think I could safely say, is an acquired taste. People who are used to deep meaningful lyrics will not find them in this cd-at all. Not to say that this isn't as good though. I think it's incredible. I love the way the songs all can get you jumping. I heard the song ""Rockafellar Skank"" in a movie and loved it-I tried to find out who it was and when I did and bought the cd (based solely on that song) I was pleasantly surprised. The tracks are very repetitive and could be offensive to some. All things considered, I totally recommend this cd."
5,"You've Come A Long Way, Baby, And We're Not Kidding","I first heard Norman Cook's (a.k.a. Fatboy Slim's) work in the form of ""Gangster Tripping"" in an MTV commercial. Soon I heard ""Praise You"" and ""The Rockafeller Skank"" (in a Surge commercial) and was hooked. Mom bought me ""You've Come A Long Way, Baby"" for Easter, and I loved it. From the backwards strings of ""Right Here, Right Now"" to the warbled screaming of ""Acid 8000"", Fatboy Slim's second album proves he is truly a musical genius. The songs serve well as dance songs and background music. I enjoy listening to his music and will for years to come. I recommend this album to anyone looking for music that's catchy, unique, and versatile."
1,The worst album ever,"If I could give this album -1000000 stars I would.From the moment you turn on the cd with right here,right now(4 words repeated all the time ) until the last song (I can`t even remember the name of it) it is the most terrible garbage I have ever heard."
