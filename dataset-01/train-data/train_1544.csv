1,The Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen,"Since I have been researching and writing about the 99th Infantry Division, I opened the book to page 366. Here Hastings states that the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine collapsed on March 15 (it fell on March 17), he writes that 28 engineers were killed (my research found 25 killed and 18 missing), Hastings writes the Ludendorff was closed on March 13(actually March 12) and that 5 pontoon bridges were opened across the Rhine. Actually one pontoon bridge was completed 200 yards downstream of the Ludendorff and another 2 miles upstream at Linz, both on March 11. If my research is correct, then Hastings has done some very sloppy fact checking. If there are that many errors on 1/4 of one page, a reader has to wonder how many similar errors are contained in this book. Robert Humphrey Sacramento, CA"
3,Misses thorough body warming,"My major complaint is this sequence felt like it was missing a thorough warmup. Baron talks about warming up and the importance of it but fails to provide it. At the beginning he quickly passes through 2 abbreviated Sun Salutations. And moves immediately to poses that require thorough warmup. I am accustomed to sweating by the time I am done with a yoga sequence, even a short one. In this one, in my cold living room, I started cold and ended almost luke warm. With thoroughly warming sequences, I can start cold and end sweating hot.The next time I do this sequence, I'll do my own Sun Sal's first and then begin the DVD."
4,Good supplement to a regular practice...,"Just tried this one yesterday; it's a good little core practice to supplement a regular Baptiste routine. One to reach for after doing Baron's ""Journey Into Power Level 2"", if you still have any energy left, or on the off-days when you just want to do a little quick core practice."
4,Amazing core workout!,"I loved this DVD, and use it at least 3 times a week in combination with his other power flow. The workout is quick (only 20 minutes), but you know that you just had an amazing workout when your finished. I also like the way Baron goes through each movement, I never feel like I'm doing something wrong. For anyone who loves yoga, I recommend this workout."
3,some effective ab exercises but I greatly prefer Bryan Kest's style & pacing,"As many reviewers recommended Baron Baptiste together with Bryan Kest, I wanted to let you know that I personally didn't like Baron's style or pacing much despite his including several very effective ab exercises. Thus I was disappointed with this purchase despite the effectiveness of some of the exercises, but awed beyond expectation by the much better instruction, pacing and content of Bryan Kest's ""Power Yoga""."
3,Slaughterhouse Pie,"Yep, I'm calling it Slaughterhouse Pie because there's a lot of cute dishes in this one. Yes, it's shot direct to DVD and the acting is typical B-Horror (e-gads! what a shock!) but it was fun and there were so many homages to the Slumber Party Massacres, High Night, Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-rama and the Burning. Randal Malone's detective reminded me of the gumshoe from Fred Olan Ray's classic Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers (yay, a Linnea Quigley flick!) and he played it straight and sincere, though I would have had him a bit more gun-happy like Mel Gibson but I can't have everything. If low budget's not your bag then, please, look somewhere else."
2,"PHI, PHI, PHI","In the beginning the Tri Phi sorority house accidentally kills a pledge, or she has a heart attack, while they were sacrificing her to Satan. Rather than inform the authorities, they dump her in a creepy old burnt out orphanage. The initiation has the girls wearing bra/panties with stockings, heels and a cape. Not the worse fantasy costumes. The sheriff is overweight and sets off your gay-dar.One year later the Tri Phi girls are having their pledge initiation in the same orphanage. You should know the rest. Acting was bad and at times comical. The plot, heck, you know it. The special effects include an echo machine, slow motion for running scenes, CG gun fire, fake blood and some fake gore.F-bomb, no sex, no nudity but lots of lingerie."
1,Lousy & Cheap!,"I cannot believe the junk that is coming out on DVD claiming to be horror. It's an insult to all of our great slasher flicks (Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc...) This movie was poorly produced, the actors had no acting ability whatsoever, the camera work was lousy, and the plot sucks. Don't buy this for the hopes of seeing hot women either, they aren't there. Nothing but homely women with sloppy bodies. The weapon was PLASTIC too, nice touch!! A complete waste of time and money."
2,Almost Better,"This movie was okay and almost better. The acting was lacking. Some acted okay. Others sucked. They could have called this movie ""Dingbats Running"". Being a sucker for a romantic story in the middle of all the slashing, it would have added to the story if the nerd had gotten the girl in the end, instead of becoming just another victim. This movie had potential, but never reached it. Had I rented it, I would never have bought it, yet it was not a total waste, just as acting classes for some in the film would not be a total waste."
4,B-bonster at its best,"The storyline is pretty good. The cast is great looking. If you are a fan a b-monster and indenpendent horror movies, this is the one for you. It has everythig you want - a deformed monster, screaming and surprises. Good movie."
5,Highly Recommend for Children,"I purchased this book for my grandsons who had never heard of Tom Sawyer. One was born in Hawaii; the other, Colombia South America. I want to take the boys back to their roots . . . Missouri . . . and, of course, go to Silver Dollar City where a new attraction this year is Tom and Huck on the water. This ""comic"" media is a great way for the boys to know the story before they get there and to realize that the fun they will experience has significant meaning."
3,"Colorful, but the kids are too grown up!","It is colorful. It is a fun hour to spend with the big purple guy. But that is it. There is zero educational value (except what a circus is like) and Kristin and Kim, two of the kids on the video, are looking a little grown up to me. They just don't fit. (sorry girls!)Some of the songs are repeats from ""More Barney Songs"" but they are well produced. It is entertaining, but lacking what some of the other Barney DVD's have to offer."
3,Where is Bob West?,"As a parent of two, I guess you could say that I am somewhat of a Barney officianado!! The premise behind this Barney video is truly wonderful, but poor Barney (with a new voice provider) sounds like he has the worst head cold that a dinosaur has ever experienced. The two gentlemen taking over Bob West's role have big shoes to fill (no pun intended) and are falling somewhat short of the mark. The video is nonetheless entertaining, and my 3 year old dances and sings as if nothing were amiss, but I know differently!"
3,would not of bought if i knew.,this is not what i expected.. too many real kids putting on an act and it repells me.. but little ones will be o.k. with watching other kids. there does not seem to be much singing and dancing.. and not of barney in it either.. he pops in and out on real kids shenigians. im sure a 4 or 5 yr. old would like it better then me and my great grandaughter..
5,Best of a great band,"Simply put, Reach for the Sky represents the pinnacle of the Sutherland Brother's underappreciated output. Released in 1975, it contains 10 concise, melodic cuts and seems to exist well apart from its 1970s context. The recording is crisp and clear; the arrangements spare and invigorating. 25 years ago I awaited each new recording from this band and, sadly, not many more were forthcoming. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend Gavin Sutherland's 2000 CD ""Diamond's and Gold"" (see http://www.gavinsutherland.net/)."
5,Excellent Country-Tinged Brit Pop,"By the time this record came out SB&Q was down to 4 members from the original 6. No matter, they were still great. The Albert's production is excellent, the band cooks on the When the train comes, Tim Renwick's guitar solo on Ain't to Proud to Beg is exquisite. There is not a bad song on the album - buy it and enjoy it."
1,All show and no go,"I bought a Hitachi 53"" widescreen HDTV and decided to buy a progressive scan DVD to get the best possible picture. On the surface this model is the best bang for the buck and looks cool. When it's working the picture is pretty good too.Unfortunately it's progressive scan performance ...[is bad]. Every time a scene comes along with lots of action and/or a high amount of white color the picture gets a horizontal black line through the top quarter of the picture or the top quarter starts to shake or the picture simply shuts down for a few seconds like something overloaded. ...Exchanged it for another one and guess what! Didn't waste my time on a third one. ...Don't waste your time with this RCA unit."
4,GREAT LOOKS; QUALITY ????,"I OWN THIS RCA DVD PLAYER,I LOVE THE EXCELLENT SILVERDESIGN AND FEATURES OF THE UNIT; HOWEVER I HAD TOEXCHANGE IT THREE TIMES BEFORE I GOT ONE THAT WORKEDWITHOUT PROBLEMS. THE FIRST ONE I GOT ""FREEZE"" THEPICTURE WITH ANY DVD I PLAYED. THE SECOND ONE PRODUCEDA RED VERTICAL LINE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY HD TV....FINALLY; THE THIRD ONE I GOT WORKED JUST FINE TILL TODAY.FOR HOW LONG WILL WORK OK ?.. WE'LL SEE...."
2,Problem with analog sound,"While the rest of this player seems to work fine, I found a problem when only analog stereo sound was plugged into the TV speakers. DVDs begin playback with no dialogue track. To fix this, you have to go into the player's internal menu system and change the digital out sound setting - even though there isn't any digital sound out connected! It must be an internal bug, but it's annoying as heck to have to go change this setting back and forth every time you put in a DVD."
5,My very favorite devotional for my children!,This is an awesome devotional book! I have used many over the years and have always come back to this one! It has so much scripture and can be used for children of all ages!!! I love this book!!
2,Looked worse on than off,"In reality, these seat covers are much more grey than they appear in the picture, but I still decided to try them out in my truck. After struggling to get them on, it wasn't worth it. They don't fit nearly as snugly as shown in the photo. The bottom fit well, but the top was baggy. It looked really bad; I'm returning them."
2,seat covers,"Cheaply made, hard to put on, I am just too lazy to send it back.Once on , they look good. I figure will change in a year or so."
5,MTD Deck Belt Purchase,The price was great and the belt is high quality and it arived vey quickly.could not have been more pleased.
4,"colorful, compact, useful",i just got it in preparation for a trip to the islands and it looks very useful and well-written. the maps are excellent (tho as a geographer i'm disappointed to find that the small-scale maps have no scale bars).great value for the price!Lee De Cola.
2,Watch without any gurantee or serial #,The watch looks okay except I have no way to verify if this is a fake or the real deal. No guarantee paper or serial # was included with the shipment. If this is a 'Gray'watch per Amazon's watch classification then it should be displayed next to the watch so the buyer is aware of what he is getting. The only confirmation I have if the item is genuine is Amazon's word. Whether this is enough only time will tell!
5,Hahahahaha!!!,"Bill Bryson is hilarious! I read this book on the train to work and many a times i had to resist myself from laughing out loud !!In this book, Bill Bryson has complied a collection of short essays which he wrote when he returned to the States. The essays are both informative and hilarious!Don't read this book in one sitting. Safe it for days when you are feeling down and in need of a good laugh!"
4,A typical Brit-American family,"Bill Bryson's book is touching and hilarious. Yet, the subjects would have been very boring if he hadn't use his sense of humour: irony. The way he says and explain things is simply amazing and covers everything: from money to motels, from junk food to "" Your Tax Form Xplained"".This poor man seems completely apart from his family and that makes him sympathetic. I mean, which of us has never received a"" You're so pathetic dad""?A very good book, even if the complaing does get boring in the end."
4,British humour the American way,"One explanation of the conception of 'British humour' is that by laughing about it was the only way for the Brits to cope with the misfortune of loosing an empire. It this 'just wonder and laugh about it' attitude which Bryson applies to all kind of Americanisms and every day wonders and (mis)fortunes. And who better then a funny bloke like Bill Bryson to reflect on these in a combined 78 news paper columns as an American who lived in the UK for over twenty years who masters the art or exaggeration. This is the ideal book to pick up every now and then, read a few notes and move on with a smile on your face."
3,You can't go home again no matter what the plane ticket says,"Although Bill Bryson writes in a very comfortable style and incorporates humor in his essays, this collection got tiresome by the end. Bryson was born in America, moved to England and then moved back to America. After he moved back, he wrote a number of columns for his readers back in England about his adjustment to life in America. From the essays, it seems he is not adjusting well. He seems to hate almost everything about the U.S. It is almost as if he felt sorry for the people of England and wrote these columns to make them feel better, however, his essays about himself were excellent. Do not read this book if you are expecting a neutral examination of life in America but you might enjoy the book if you have negative preconceived notions that you would like reinforced. You might also like the book if you are curious about how the English see America."
1,Problems!,"The full payment is drawn from my account but have still not got the product, a Kindle book by Bill Brysson. Have tried to send a message but dont know how to reach Amazon."
2,GREAT POTENTIAL- - - Lost!,"I purchased the book primarily because of the hard-hitting title, I wanted to read something realistic and not just a bunch of hot air. I have to say that, at least in part, the book had a realistic tone to it. Unfortunatly the author dropped the ball and filled most of the pages with dry statistics and a lot of personal preferences and opinions. I can't say the book is a wast of time, but it is a slacker! To put it another way, I felt the book was probably 20% of full potential. After reading the book I was left with the feeling that the whole purpose of the writing was to keep people from moving to Florida."
5,The best reference book I ever bought!,Excellent! It is the most complete reference book in Spanish I have ever seen and used. My father and I have used it so much that we have worn out two previous editions. Phenomenal!
4,Splash guards,"The glasses fit quite well, however; they do fog up a little bit. I am happy with them, nonetheless and have recommended them to other nurses."
5,Batu: The Transformation,"I enjoyed the book immensely. It is about a yong woman's courageous life journey, her Transformation from an intelligent yet unruly child to a sensitive, balanced, articulate, spiritual woman. Her jouney represents all of our life's journeys. The book was evem more impressive given it was written by a male and about a woman. The author was very insightful and accurate with the feelings and thoughts a woman would have. A book of courage and faith."
2,Couldnt finish it...,"This book keeps winking at me from the shelf... i couldnt finish it.The main man drove me mad, I cant put up with all the 'victim' nonsence...Whilst the book had some brilliant lines that made me laugh out loud, i found the story to be weak hidden behind fancy words !!"
4,over intellectualized parenting,"THis is one of the most over intellectualized look at parenting I've ever read. It's as if the couple's first child is born an intellectual, and both mom and dad spend so much time reflecting and intellectualizing everything, it's incredible. I thought I would dislike it but I actually found it amusing, in a weird way. I give the author the benefit of the doubt that he intentionally overintellectualizes the parents to exagerate the type of parenting where each and every need of the child is central (particularly for the mom in this novel). The mom drove me nuts--she basically has no self. But, she recognizes this but can't stop it. Dad is an alcoholic intellectual with a crazy mother who he can't seem to separate from. The plot twists sound familiar but the writing is different enough that it sticks with you."
4,"3.5 out of 4: Strong start, drags a bit at the end","This unique novel centers on Patrick Melrose, a London barrister, with a wife and two young sons. Patrick remains subject to the whims of his senile mother, who has converted Patrick's childhood home into a New Age retreat. Narrated by turns from the perspectives of Patrick, his wife, and their elder son, the novel vividly captures how the family members' roles shift with the birth of the second son and the deterioration of Patrick's mother. I enjoyed the shifting viewpoints and voices. The book starts particularly strong but devolves to be somewhat unbelievable and tedious by the end."
3,Well Written but been there seen that story Arc..,"This is an enjoyable book to read as it is very well written full or wit and lots of clever metaphors and descriptions.. I enjoyed it.However, although it is entertaining, it's story structure is predictable and has been done before, though I guess nothing is really new.Despite this I would still recommend reading this book just because the descriptions are so delicious."
4,"Mother's Milk: complexities of life, richly observed","This is the first of Mr St. Aubyn's novels I have read. I will now be seeking out the others.The observational wit in this novel is perceptive, incisive and cruelly accurate. Because the satire is so splendid, narrative weakness made less of an impact on my enjoyment of the novel. The strongest part of the narrative, for me, was that delivered by Patrick's son Robert: especially in the early part of the novel.This novel should be read and enjoyed for the language alone. I expect that the underlying story makes more sense to those who are already familiar with Patrick Melrose from the earlier novels.Recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
3,A love hate relationship with this book,"I liked this book and hated it. I doidn't like the father figure, I felt he used his depression as an excuse to be cruel to his family. A selfish indivual, who blamed all his problems on his mother. The children where delightful characters. The language was wonderful, and a delight to read. The imagagry at the beginning sucked me right in and it was the langugage that kept me reading the book. I did prefer The Night Watch. (By Sarah Waters)"
5,Great Resource!!,"This book encompasses everything a person need to know to be an effective teacher. It is great forsomeone new to the profession, or for people who evaluate/coach teachers. I saw John Saphier speak and he was fantastic! A great book to use for a book study!"
1,Wrong edition,"The book showing up in the picture is the 6th edition, but the book I received was the 5th edition. Beware...."
1,Worst movie ever,"This was absolutely terrible on all accounts, It was a waste of time, thank God i didn't buy it or i would have been even more heart-broken.PLEEEASEE don't waste you time, honestly it's unwatchable!"
5,Required Break In,These required a little break in period but they rock now. They feal secure so I can focus on my game and not worry about my feat.
5,I wish I could live his life !!,"David Ford's book reads like a James Bond tale of intrigue. From humble lifeguard beginnings, through Hollywood illuminatti, sexcapades and fast-track adventures, David shows compassion and concern for the Average Joe's right to smoke and be free. A long time advocate of legal and safe use of marijuana, this book is not a polemic but a story of one man's journey. A great read and a great romp."
4,and a great read!,"David Ford's autobiographical and well documented book about marijuana is a must read for anyone who wants to know more about this oft-maligned herb. The personal detail is very interesting. Mr. Ford has lived a rich and interesting life - with some riveting sexual adventures!Interspersed throughout the book are well-researched and documented facts about the medicinal qualities of marijuana. I enjoyed the book very much, and I think you will too!"
2,Too theoretical,"I read this was THE book about numerical computations, but for me it is just too theoretical, with no practical applications or examples. If you need to to know the fundamentals of numerical techniques, or if want to analyze some program with mathematical formality, than I guees this would be a good choice."
2,Not coherent!,"This book is mainly translated into English from German; therefore, the explanation isn't very clear. You spend much time to get the understanding of a subject. It isn't very much related with numerical analysis, instead modelling. Don't expect to find problems about using Numerical Formulas... Another disadvantage of this book is that it is divided into two parts, so, you must spend too much money to get the full content from two parts."
3,Missing the point,"I am probably missing the point of this book (the reason why I am giving it three stars). First the bad: the never ending search for thugs (sorry, you where looking in the wrong places) ... taking things for what they are not (Veerappan a hero)... using two sensational subjects to sell a book on India (thugs, kali) and now the good: 1) It tries (and succeeds to an extend) to show India in its true light (India is neither the land of thugs, dirt and darkness nor the vibrant land of mysticism, color, foods). 2) it throws light on what many British reforms in India truly were."
5,Milwaukee 6523-21,"This product meets all my expectations. Powerful, easy blade changes, and the rotating handle helps releave arm fatigue."
5,Another Great Milwaukee Tool As Usual,"A ""get-the-job-done"" tool. The detachable cord is very convenience. Changing the blade is incredibly easily/fast (no tools required). I've only had the SuperSawzall for a few weeks and only used it a couple of times. But, it got the job done easily and quickly."
1,A Major Disappointment,"A full-length analysis of Jackson's subtle, disturbing fiction is long overdue. Hattenhauer's book, unfortunately, is a major disappointment. His interpretations are limited and overdetermined, he completely pathologizes the admittedly troubled Jackson, and (perhaps most alarming, given Jackson's fierce, dark wit) he seems to have no sense of humor. Moreover, Hattenhauer's style is so jargon-ridden it almost comes across as a parody. (And yes, I do understand and support the idea that literary criticism, like all academic disciplines, needs and deserves its own technical vocabulary; I also understand that books intended for academic audiences need not be ""readable"" in the same way as books intended for the general public.) I look forward to a better book about this wonderful writer."
5,best album in years by a great (CANADIAN) band,"Indeed: this is the best Hip album in years; there are songs here as strong as anything else the band has written -- I'd put ""The Drop Off"" up against pretty much any song that the band has penned since ""Nautical Disaster,"" anyhow. I didn't like their previous disc, In Between Evolution, at all -- it sounded like the band were wandering lost, repeating themselves; Bob Rock appears to have whipped'em into intense focus. Tho' there is a bit of filler-feeling stuff (I haven't learned to love ""Luv (sic)"" yet, f'rinstance), I'd agree that this is their strongest release since Phantom Power; and damn, seeing these guys live is a phenomenal experience -- tho' ""The Kids Don't Get It"" is an odd and provocative experience indeed in the concert hall!"
4,One of the best,The Hip doesn't morph the way U2 does. Its albums are variations on a theme. Some are better than others and World Container is one of the best.
3,"I love The Hip, but...","Let me start by saying that I have been a Tragically Hip fan since 1989 when I first heard Up to Here. I worked at a record shop and stuck the tape (yes, I said tape) in and it blew me away. They had/have such a cool feel and groove, that it was and still is difficult to put into words what makes them so great. I have liked/loved every album they have put out, but at the same time don't expect them to ""do the same album"" every time. This being said, I don't quite understand all of the accolades that World Container is getting. I don't know if it is too pop oriented for me, but for some reason it is my least favorite Hip album to date. I still like it - I don't think I could ever not like a Tragically Hip album. It just hasn't illicited the same feeling of ""wow, this is cool"" that I normally get when listening to any Hip release. I'm going to keep listening with the hope that something will click and I'll leave another, more glowing review. Great band - not a great album."
4,Coleman 2-Mantle Propane Lantern. (Not 'Instant Start' ),"Great lantern. Lightweight, well designed (except that the 'legs' tend to fall off the tank when you carry it. One other disappointment. I bought Coleman Lantern Lighters (Prod. # 503A) to install in each unit, only to find that this is one of the few Coleman lanterns that will not accomodate the lighter. That's a shame, as the lighter is a great convenience. Otherwise, I was pleased, and the recipients (they were Christmas gifts for teenage nephews) are very happy."
5,Does the job!,"The lantern has been successfully used in hunting expeditions. It has been knocked down several times yet it has not failed. Propane tank and bottom plate make it portable, practical and safe."
2,Missing parts,"We tried to use this lantern during Hurricane Sandy. However a gasket was missing and the propane leaked out. This ;lantern was purchased ""new"" from Amazon. I wonder?"
4,Perfect for my means,"Not much to rate here, it works properly and is somewhat effecient on gas when moderately illuminated. I acheived almost 5 hours with goin full bore. If it came with a case for the price...5 stars then."
3,"good product, but loud","i bought this because I thought the propane tanks would be a little more portable and easier to use instead of messing around with fuel. And it does have these advantages, but while it is on, it is really loud. but it works well and is convenient"
5,Render Prominent Thy Pure Protuberance.,"The scheduled maintenance is easy to perform without much initial start-up cost for tools. I have a modest garage-based work shop, (Workbench, vice grip, electric drill, and a few common hand tools hanging on the peg board) and I have been able to perform almost all of the maintenance routines unassisted, right here at home. Although, a decent set of ratchets would facilitate greatly.Whether you jut out, stand out, stick out, poke out, stick up, bristle up, shoot up, swell over, hang over or bend over (Severe, but fortunately rare) you will find a perfect maintenance routine for your Schnozzle, Honker, Gibbosity, Hump, Beak, Hooter, Bulb, Node,. . . I have removed 30 years off my Wafter and can now flair my nostrils like a tyke of 20. Check out the chapter on ""Chiseling the Dashing Profile."" Stuart shows you how you can have that Gablesque profile for less than the cost of the book!"
1,Oldest CD and every song is on the bigger sets.,"Every song on this compilation CD is in the 60 song, 3 CD box set, ""Stand Up and Cheer"". So there's not much point in buying it...Especially since this is the oldest Shirley Temple CD of all, and the sound clarity usually gets better, as computer technology advances and people care more and more about restoring old recordings to their ORIGINAL sound quality."
5,Nice Product,The product was exactly what I ordered & I received it when I thought I was going too. Would order from this seller again.
2,average batteries,adds a cute touch to any present you may be giving to a little girl. you get what you pay for.
1,Do not buy this book unless you support Crime,"This is nothing more than deception and lies in an attempt to garner more support for anti gun goons who would rather criminals kill you and your family than give you the freedom to protect them.A major problem with the anti gun goons is they believe that keeping honest people from owning guns will cut down on crime. Something that has been disproven many times over. Also something very basic to know is no matter what gun laws you have criminals do not follow the law, so they are only hurting the honest people trying to protect themselves and their families by banning guns."
1,Who is he kidding?,"There have been a number of books written recently that have remarkable credibility because of the unlikely authors of the books. Who would have thought that the harshest attack on current anti-drug policy, demanding legalization, would come from a Reagan Republican? John Lott's book More Guns, Less Crime, was another highly credible book because it also came from an unlikely source. Diaz's book is disappointing and flawed because his agenda comes across on every page. The book becomes frustrating and painful. I find it interesting that reviewers on this page assume that people who pan this book only do so because they haven't read it. We've read it. But this book brings to mind the saying that a mind is like a parachute. It only works when it's open. Many of us who read Diaz's book did so with an open mind, and were disappointed by Diaz's clear bias. This book may be good, but only if you're part of the choir being preached to."
1,An injustice to every law abbiding citizen in the United Sta,This book is way off the mark. Anecdotal information only serves to fan the flames over the issue of guns. 150 childern under age 5 died in 1996 from fires they started with cigarette lighters verses the 30 from gun accidents. What are the federal regulations on the sale and ownership of lighters? The poppycock continues.
1,Social Activism Run Amok,"Another liberal trying to save the world. This book reeks of Mr. Diaz's agenda which basically says, ""I know better than the millions of Americans that use firearms for sport, recreation, relaxation, and to put food on their family's table""Do not give this misguided person your money!Chris"
1,America-hating GARBAGE,"the % of crimes committed with LEGALLY purchased firearms is practically nonexistent and more people are killed every year by accidentally falling down stairs than are accidentally killed by guns. The author should have wrote a book about being anti stairs, GUNS KILLED PEOPLE LIKE SPOONS MADE ROSIE O'DONNELL FAT"
1,A waste of time and money,"The facts are in. Widespread gun ownership saves lives. Sixty-four lives are saved by defensive uses of guns for every life lost because someone wielded a gun. For a dispassionate and well-documented analysis of the value of guns to society, read ""More Guns, Less Crime."" by John R. Lott, Jr."
5,"Outstanding work - thoughtful, well researched, compelling.","Coming on the heals of the CO high school shooting tragedy, Diaz's book is even clearer and more compelling. This author, who has a wealth of experience in understanding the root causes of violence, hits the nail on the head in this excellent book.It is depressing, however, to read the numerous negative reviews posted for this book which are clearly written by gun fanatics and gun store owners and by those who haven't taken the time to read this book. Gun violence is clearly on the rise in America and the number of Americans killed annually by guns will soon surpass the tens of thousands killed in auto accidents."
1,The Enemy Speaks,"Never have I read A book so steeped in blatant misinformation than this.Your statistical breakdown regarding gun deaths falls very short of what most of us call ""truth"". Such as including incidents in which law-enforcement used deadly force with a firearm against deadly criminals. Twisting figures and facts to advance an agenda to disarm the nation makes this book worthy of a place near my toilet.The Second Amendment is NOT about crime Mr. Diaz. It is about the American people retaining the ability to resist government tyranny, which we all see and know is mounting.Am I a ""gun nut""? Yes. I am also a "" free speech"" nut, ""free press"" nut and a person who understands that this book is on the wrong side of history."
3,Not for die hard fans of the tv show,A rather interesting book but it is a cross between the tv show itself and Murder She Wrote. The only resemblence betweeen itself and the tv show are the names of the characters(excluding the dog!). Rather shocking and unnerving but is interesting to read none the less
2,Not so inspiring,"This book had some cute project ideas, but not many that truly inspired me. Many of the projects just didn't tie together into themed rooms. To me, the rooms were not that creative nor ones that I would want to use. This book really wasn't what I was looking for for children's room ideas. If you are just looking to make a few projects (i.e. decorated lamp, storage box, or bulletin board) this book may be what you are looking for. However, if you want to totally redo your child's room another book may provide more inspiration."
3,Basic material,"Basic stuff. I'm sure one could find most of the info free on the Internet these days. I'm new to all this so at the time I did not know. The good thing about the book is that the info is in one place and there are a few tips that I would not have thought about. If one is doing mods already, this book would be old info.Quick turnaround- book went out same day I ordered. As for vendors rating, five stars."
3,Needed a proof reader!,"This is a very informative book for the PC enthusiast, but a few references seem to be missing."
2,"""Cooler"" is not cold","The cooler won't get anything cold - mine only went down to 50 (in a 70 degree room) and it took many hoursto get there with anything in it. (It was blowing 46 degree air after 2 hours). And it warms up quickly - 14 degrees in only an hour and 1/2.Add to that a continuous whir noise, so you don't want to bring it into your motel room and leave it plugged it and the battery load which occurs if you leave it in the car overnight, this is a limited use device (in my humble opinion)."
2,Koolatron not at advertised,"The Koolatron does not provide any additional cooling capacity or ability to keep cool beyond what any other insulated bag would do, and is not as cold as a bag that has had a frozen ice pack added to it. And the manufacturer recommends that it not be plugged in for more than 4 hours at a time, which eliminates use as a day-long cooling container. I do not believe the capability of this container warrants the expense."
3,not so cool,The cooler doesn't cool as much as we expected. When we ordered we didn't notice the statement about cooling only 40 degrees the outside temp. That just isn't cold enough most times.
3,Does not cool,This cooler does not cool by itself. I suggest buying another brand or type. The only thing I like about it is the bag that allows you to carry it around easily.
3,Satisfactory,"Overall, I'm satisfied with the product. My only complaint is that it is very noisy. However, I found that if you lay it down with the fan on top, it's much quieter. Temperature expectations were adequate."
3,"Accomplished writing, but the style was not to my taste","I bought this book prior to a trip to Paris. While I recognize that the author is an accomplished writer, I found his style not to my taste, and I stopped reading the book after three chapters. I found the writing verbose while not being particularly evocative. I loaned it to my traveling companion, and she also did not like it enough to finish it.This is purely a matter of taste. I encourage you to use Amazon's ""Search inside this book"" function, read a sample and see if you like it."
4,A Dim View of the City of Light?,"The author spends a fair amount of time complaining about Paris...the traffic, the dogs, the dog poop, the smell, the tourists, the cafes, etc. I am not even sure that author, David Downie, likes Paris that much, but he is enthusiastic about his subject. He makes me want to walk the streets of Paris with him as my guide. His word play sprinkled throughout the book is a joy.""Paris, Paris"" is a collection of articles so there is some overlap. (I got really tired of the repeated description of Haussmannization - demolishing buildings and straightening streets.)This book is a good one to remind you of the feel of Paris after your first visit and might be a good guidebook to use on a second trip to Paris when you are looking for something that is not necessarily in the ordinary tourist manual."
2,It's okay.,"The book is not what I envisoned, but it's okay. I found a previous copy on my shelf from a few years back. I made the mistake of purchasing it again with its new cover."
2,Not that exciting,Have started this book twice and have moved on. The author is impressed with himself and his city but we are not engaged really. There is a lot of neat history in Paris but this book doesn't get me interested. Instead...go to Paris if you can.
4,A Journey Through Paris,"David Downie came to Paris in 1986, full of romantic notions about the city. He ended up living there and writing extensively about Paris. This book has 31 prose sketches of ""Paris Places,"" ""Paris People,"" and ""Paris Phenomena,"" including one about the Luxembourg Gardens, one of my favorite parks in Paris.This was a really great book, and I loved Downie's various essays and the subjects he chose to write about. This book will probably stay on my bookshelf, and I'll probably revisit some of his essays.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, [...]*"
3,Indispensable curmudgeon,"A wonderfully ill-tempered, sentimental, and informed account of nooks and crannies in the most interesting of cities. If I could arrange it, I would introduce Downie to the venerable Guy Grangeret, a visite-conference guide to Paris who is nothing less than Downie's spiritual twin. Neither man's dicta are suitable for beginners: all that irony and allusion would be wasted. Both provide insights and make connections that enrich the experience as well as thinking of the seasoned visitor."
5,my absolute favorite Paris book,"This is my favorite book about Paris. My copy has many little flags, so I can plan adventures on my upcoming trip to Paris. The book whipped me to a frenzy of excitement (or at least great enthusiasm) for David Downie's fascinating descriptions of people and places.The essays are current and convey a feeling of love and respect for obscure parts of Paris, as well as a new way of looking at popular destinations, like Pere Lachaise Cemetery, Place des Vosges, and Ile Saint-Louis.Whether you are an actual or armchair traveler, this is a wonderful book."
2,Not too soft inside,"I bought this light-weight bag for my 11 year old for sleep-overs because the color was perfect for her. Unfortunately, She didn't like the texture of the inside lining. I agree. It doesn't feel good against the skin - kind of ""polyestery"""
4,Great basic sleeping bag!,"I bought this sleeping bag for my daughter (she's 8 and tall) - chose to get the adult size so we get more years out of it. The color is perfect (she loves purple) and it was the right warmth for an overnight. I'm sure it would be fine for camping outside in ""regular"" warm weather, even in New England."
5,Purple Coleman Farimont Sleeping bag,Great color - great warmth. My daughter says that she needs to sleep in socks in it though because it sticks to her feet otherwise. She loves the bag though and it fold up into its own bag which is great!
3,Great Sleeping Bag - but the picture is deceiving,"We ordered this sleeping bag for our daughter and we just received it... it looks great and works just fine, but it is navy blue and is pictured as being red on Amazon... We're going to keep it, but she is very disappointed and we still need to buy another one..."
4,Giggles and twists.,"If you're interested in a few giggles and a little mystery, this is the place to look. This is a nice, light read with a surprising twist at the end. The setting is unique and the characters endearing. I look forward to more by Cheryl Norman!"
5,A Week In Provence,"In 1959, De Larrabeiti (then a young guy out to discover and experience; now, to judge by the book jacket, very much the Renaissance man) accompanied traditional French shepherds on their week-long, annual trek from the winter grazing on Riviera meadows to mountain pastures in the Alpes de Provence. The book is a gorgeous, insightful combo of regional history and traditions, the shepherd's life, the journey itself over an astonishing terrain, De Larrabeiti's physical toughening and mastering of century-old skills... But, most of all, the ancient stories and legends he heard... Night after night around the campfire, each man telling his favorite as a bottle of brandy passed from hand to hand. We're not talking tepid fairy tales here. Rather seiges, irony, betrayal, tragedy, acts of faith, Saracen raids, hand-to-hand combat and fatal love. Last but not least, De Larrabeiti writes really stylish prose. Can't wait to read the rest of his stuff."
5,Quite Possibly My Favorite Album Ever,"This album is absolutely great in every way. The songs are incredibly charming. It's one of those records you discover and it's an epiphany. ""And Don't The Kids Just Love It"" has inspired me as an artist. I love it in every way. If you love 60s AM pop and super catchy new wave music, you won't be disappointed. You'll play this record over and over and wish it never ended. Genius!"
2,Orion More Than Just a Flash in the Pan,"""So You Ran"" occasionally appears on one-hit wonder compilations, but Orion the Hunter was more than just a flash in the pan; some interesting rock history runs through the band. After 1978's Don't Look Back, Tom Scholz essentially gave everyone in Boston the boot, including guitarist Barry Goudreau. Goudreau's 1980 solo record features Boston alumni Brad Delp and Sib Hashian on vocals and drums, respectively, along with singer Fran Cosmo; the album produced the minor hit ""Dreams."" In 1984 Goudreau formed Orion with Cosmo, bassist Bruce Smith, and former Heart drummer Michael De Rosier. Resurfacing in 1991, Goudreau and Delp formed RTZ (Return to Zero) and had hits with ""When Your Love Comes Back Around"" and ""Face the Music."" ""So You Ran,"" from Orion's debut LP, reached #58 in June of 1984."
3,"Not bad,but not Boston.","Barry has done a good attempt with his band, but I was expecting a little more Boston Influence. More heavy than I like. Sounds too eighties heavy metal to me."
5,EXCELLENT ALBUM,"Excellent sound, excellent voice(Vocal Fran Cosmo), excellent songs and excellent rock music.Just buy it.You never will be regret.This album is extremely solid, bold, and represents what the 80's still means to me: music that is humble but still has enough power, soul, and dedication to move the listener to a different height of reality and hope."
4,"NOT THE TYPICAL ""BOSTON STYLE"" MUSIC.","There is much influence from other song writers in this Barry Goudreau CD but the music is good none the less. If you are looking for ""Boston style"" music, don't buy this CD. But if you want some good rock and roll, you won't be disappointed."
2,"Ehhh, so ya ran.","I was living in Providence, RI in the summer of '84 when this album (mainly ""So You Ran"") was peaking. OTH put on a free concert in big park there in Providence...I got the worst sunburn of my life but, hey, it was free.Anyway, all of the FM jocks in New England were making, ""Well, that was Boston...oops! I mean Orion..."" jokes. The reviewers who say ""Boston retread"" pretty much reflect the prevailing view of this album circa June-July '84.It isn't horrific music. But, how can any of you survive lyrics like: ""I'd hoped you would stay/but now you've gone awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayayay.""??? Jesse Jackson busts better rhymes than that."
1,WHAT HAPPENED???,"LONG TIME BOSTON FAN. PURCHASED BARRY GOUDREAU SOLO ALBUM &RTZ's RETURN TO ZERO. LIKED BOTH OF THEM. PURCHASED THIS CD &I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.... SAME WRITERS (DELP/GOUDREAU), BUTTHE SOUND WAS DIFFERENT.. I THINK BRAD SHOULD HAVE SUNG THESESONGS INSTEAD OF FRAN COSMO...."
4,Poor Man's Boston,"This is a very good album. Great guitar work by Barry Goudreau. The album, however, is unbalanced in the sequence of the songs. The best songs from the album are easily the first 4. After that it is all downhill. Those first 4 songs are easily worth the price of the album. Many people compared this band to Boston, but I don't know why?. Boston's first 3 albums are much better musically and lirically than this one. Brad Delp is a much better singer than Fran Cosmo. Fran Cosmo sounds to much like the guy from Starship and after awhile his high pitched voice becomes annoying. Barry Goudreau although a fine guitarist has nowhere near the musical talent as Tom Scholz. Don't get me wrong this is a fine album and highly recommended, but the comparisons to Boston are just plain ridiculous."
5,"Total 80's rock, yet refined!","As a young American soldier stationed in Germany when this one came out, this album, like Aldo Nova's albums sent us melodic rock fans into a spin and was a must at any party! I have looked for this ""CD"" for years and found it here, thank you Amazon!!!!!"
3,Orion The Hunter - self-titled (Razor&Tie),"Originally hit the stores in 1984.A decent Boston spin-off band,featuring guitarist Barry Gouldreau and some contributions from Boston vocalist Brad Delp(that alone drew my interest).This was the band's sole effort.Better cuts include ""All Those Years"",""Dark And Stormy"",""Fast Talk"" and maybe ""I Call It Love"".Remember they were support act for Aerosmith's US tour that summer.Only downside of this CD reissue is that it might grow stale after,say the fourth play.Does NOT stand the test of time,like Boston's first three albums do."
5,A must get!,Kory and the Fireflies best album to date. The long wait was worth it. Maybe with this one TPTB will realize what they've been missing...Great Job guys!!!!!
2,To long in transit,"I don't know much about the grasses, but mine arrived about 10 days after thry had been mailed. They were all brown except for one which was a pale green. I planted them in moist soil and will wait and see what the spring does."
4,"Good music,but different from the usual Ellington pieces","This is not your usual Ellington LP. It is more like a concerto with 9 movements, from 3 to near 8 minutes each. Ellington attempts to give a musical potrait of New Orleans , the atmosphere, the traditons, and the music.... especially the music. Starting with ""Blues for New Orleans""he goes to ""Bourbon Street"" and from there to ""Portrait of Louis Armstrong"", and then on to ""Thanks for the Beautiful Land on the Delta""gives a ""Tribute to the Second Line"", ""Portrait of Sidney Bechet""and others for a total of nine.It is very listenable music, but is diffent from what people expect from Ellington, and so has never been given the popularity it deserves. Music like this is not going to be played on disk jockey radio shows with their three minute tunes between commercials.If you like Jazz in general and have a reverence for the history of Jazz you will likely enjoy this LP."
4,"The Duke: ""New Orleans Suite"" -- PERFECT!","Exactly what you'd expect from Duke Ellington: a perfect CD!! Just a fabulously entertaining musical experience. If you love jazz, buy it if you don't have it!"
3,The life forms of plants and statistical plant geography,literature about life forms of plant phanerogamic
4,The essential Louvin Brothers collection,"I came to know about the Louvin Brothers songs from recordings by modern artists like Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, but I had never heard any of the originals. I was not prepared for the stunning songwriting and singing that this collection displays. There is something to like in every one of the 24 songs.This music sounds timeless, and it's hard to believe that this music was created in the mid fifties. I reserve 5-star ratings for the absolute best only, so do not interpret my 4-star rating to mean that I have reservations. I recommend this as highly as any country music recording that I know."
2,monster disappointment,"This toy is way overpriced. It is too difficult for children under 8 to snap the jumping mechanism into place. It requires a lot of smooth surface to work...a driveway would be good, but you see the safety concerns with that idea. This is not worth the money. You can get a regular toy truck for a quarter of the price and the child will have as much fun."
2,Won't last long,"The ""Hot Wheels"" and ""Grave Digger"" brands were a huge plus for my 6-year old son, but the toy is rather cumbersome to spring-load. My son finds it difficult, as do his much older friends. Do it wrong, and the plastic parts will suffer early damage. I don't expect it to be functional after a couple of months."
3,Yoga Review,The instructor is great so no reflection on him. I have another workout by him which I love. This one I did not care for because the music sounded ritualistic and I couldn't understand the words. I just rather stick to the fundamentals and not get too spiritual about the workout. Again I gave a 3 because of the music. You may be different and music may not be a factor for you.Baron Baptiste Live!: Soul of Strength
1,Baron Baptiste Live - Soul of Strength,For beginners is a waist of money and a mockery. It's a constant race of positions without good explanation of them. Too much talking without easy to follow directions.
4,Just Like My Power Yoga Class,"This DVD is great for when you can't make it into the studio (although, then you don't have the benefit of a slightly heated room). The moves are all from my power yoga class that I attend, so I even know how to mix it up a little bit as it goes along. I imagine this video would be most appropriate for advanced-beginners and intermediates."
3,needs more warmups,"The tape is good except I don't feel you get warmed up enough before going into some of the postures. Also, some are not held for long enough. The music and instructions are excellent. I do like it enough that I would consider buying another one of his videos in the future, but I am waiting for more feedback from users on some of the other tapes."
5,"Light, free & energized","I have three videos (and a CD for travel) by Baron Baptiste ... these videos are among my favorites and I reach for them again and again. All three videos show a mixed class of students in his Boston studio - they vary in ages and abilities and Baron discussed modifications to the poses. It is a Vinyasa practice so you move from pose to pose, but you do hold the poses long enough to feel them. ""Soul of Strength"" is the longest of the three, at 60 minutes, and the time flies. The video focuses on core muscle groups, the abs and back, and hip openers. For me, the best thing about these videos is the soul-stirring music of Krishna Das in the background. I highly recommend this instructor and series - as Baron says, ""Get ready to discover the world of bliss."""
4,awesome,"I've been doing Vinyasa yoga on and off for 3 years now and this DVD is about 80% similiar to my class I take but without the intense heat. This is definitely NOT a beginner's dvd, I definitely would say its Intermediate.This is a DVD that is good for those who have been in either constant practice in a class or someone who knows the vinyasa flow positions. I would not recommend this DVD to those looking for something new. This a good repeat of the class you most likely take when you dont watch the DVD. Its a good practice for those times when you dont have the money for class and want to practice in the comfort of your home.I like the modifications that he provides, with his nice soothing voice and it goes rather quickly. The abdominal section is not as challenging as his Core but this DVD works the entire body and has some pretty challenging balancing positions. It sure gets your heart pumping and I work up a real good sweat overall."
5,Moving,"Italian director and actor Nanni Moretti delivers a deeply moving meditation on the nature of grief and loss with ""The Son's Room."" Moretti plays Giovanni, a respected psychoanalyst, who leads a normal and happy life with his wife Paola and their two teenage children. But when Andrea, their son, suddenly dies in a diving accident, the family is forced to deal with this tragedy as best they can. It would be easy for the film to become so depressing and sad as to be unwatchable, but somehow that does not happen. The characters are so well drawn that, while you feel all their heartbreak, you know they will stay together and eventually find a way to deal with this. This is a beautiful film. Highly recommended!"
2,"Good idea, pleasant acting, zero for execution","A naturalist Italian movie about the life of a psychologist and his family faced with trials and tribulations.Any naturalist movie is heavily dependent on the attraction of its characters and the things they do. In this case, big zero. The father is a psychologist that is so incompetent that his patients again and again criticize him for his total incompetence, and we don't see him do actual work (although we do see the typical plethora of weird patients on the couch). Nanni Moretti's acting and directing is delightful but he has not given himself anything to do. The mother seems to do little else than advance the plot, and the daughter could be more interesting if she was fleshed out at all.I could see the rating for this movie go down in my head as it went on, out of boredom. It's a good idea for a movie, Moretti is pleasant to watch, but he gets a zero for execution."
5,As close to eternal as tire levers get,"I first bought these levers at REI in Berkeley when I was in college. That was in the late 1980s. I still have them, and they appear as strong as the day they were new, with no visible signs of fatigue. I must have changed 50 tubes in all those years.So when a different brand of levers snapped on me after only a few uses, guess what I bought to replace them? Hopefully the product is as good now as it was then."
1,Not Tough,"I broke two of these on a single clincher tire change. They may work on flexibles, but if I hadn't been riding with a partner who had another set of levers for me to use, I'd have been stuck improvising. I won't buy another set."
4,Norwegian poetry is max,"Its good, full of realy good poems Two of the tree norwegein poems in the book realy was good Very nice I recomend this for all poem lovers! :)"
3,Can't quite decide...,"Gordon divides her book into parts: the ""facts"" and the narrative. The narrative reads much like a novel (at least partially because Gordon doesn't have a lot of concrete research to draw upon so she can fill in the blanks in an... entertaining manner) while the rest of the book is filled with (often dry) research. It seems as if Gordon is torn between writing an academic work or a popular work and ends up not quite hitting the mark with either. If I hadn't been reading the book for class, I would probably just skim through the book for the story (there's a section of each chapter devoted just to the orphans' story) and then check with the rest of the book is I was very curious about a specific detail."
3,The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction,"A big disappointment.Not much about the children and too long on dates and events. Our book club all felt the same way. Somewhat bored. The title fools you, I kept looking for more info on the children. Good for educational use, not for interesting,want more reading. Too drawn out."
3,The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction,"I was disappointed in the book. I kept looking for more on the children and all I got was dates and events. The title misleads you. Our book club all felt the same way. Good for educational purposes but short on interesting and ""want more"" story line, in fact there was no story line. Boring!."
4,"Good, could be better","""The Village That Vanished"" is a story about the people of an African village who work together to avoid slavers that are coming their way, showing how faith and perserverence are rewarded. The story is set among the ""Yao"" people but no information is given as to who the Yao people are or where they live or whether this is a story told in Africa. The story seems to be set in East Africa (the slavers appear to be Arab, not European). Some background information would be very useful. The illustrations are excellent."
2,Not what I was expecting!,"I thought I would be able to show this video to my hs biology class and we would see amazing shots of different ecosystems. Boy was I wrong. The movie lasted only 33 minutes...thank goodness, and 8 eight those minutes was watching a helicopter fly towards an island. Sorry Harrison Ford, not one of you best!"
4,A touching search for days gone by on the Milwaukee Road,"If you've ever lost someone you loved, you know that you treasure the things they loved. Stan Johnson's stepfather worked for the Milwaukee Railroad for 53 years. Johnson felt compelled, a few years ago, to see the old places and right-of-way of the abandoned Milwaukee finding, everywhere he went in Montana, Idaho and Washington, a flood of memories of his youth, railroading, electric locomotives, people, stories, history and a rich tapestry of lives and events that the Milwaukee Road represented through Johnson's beloved stepfather. As Johnson retraces the physical route and structures of the Milwaukee, his memories come alive, and you will read each word with a lump in your throat as Johnson returns to find his stepfather and his railroad."
3,"Great idea, but problem is you need a driver installed","I thought this disk would be perfect for traveling and using in internet cafes accross Asia. Unfortunately, one requires an installation program on every PC you use it on, which is a bit of a pain, especially where most cafes won't allow this to be installed. (on computers where the driver can be loaded, uou can download the driver over the internet).The disk is a great idea, but this ""little"" detail certainly isn't advertised clearly"
3,OK but......,"This is not a best of, as the most interesting works seem to be on the individulal CD's. A poor selection."
2,Couldn't use it,"If you don't use a box or mattress foundation, this product is useless. I have to sell it because they don't accept return for open box."
5,George Jones & Gene Pitney = A Brilliant Pairing,"Well, I've done this all wrong. I have given sort of a review I guess in commenting on ""JESS JESS""'s review. So my diatribe is gotten to by clicking on COMMENT 1 at the end of his review.To be brief, I loved it back in the 60's and I love it now. It sounded so different from anything we'd ever heard where I come from, and it was just great to hear someone singing with one of our favorites. But, you know, that was in a totally different world and time. We Southerners/hillbilly/country lovers were laughed at and made fun of back then. But we didn't care, we still loved our hillbilly/country music. We appreciated and treasured things like that. It sounded great in those days. Even on our scratchy records. I didn't pass up listening to any of the songs. I played the whole thing over and over. I'm just glad to be able to hear it again on the CD I purchased through Amazon."
5,Neglected mini-masterpiece,"Wonderful collection of the two albums Jones and Pitney made together in the mid-60s. The pairing sounds far-fetched, but works amazingly well and their voices are a great surprise match. The material is generally first-rate as well (a couple of hokey bits, but that is par for the course for Jones, who seems to have a soft spot for corn even today). Fans of either singer need this record, fans of country music need this record, fans of duet singing need this record."
5,moving progresive rock,"great opening cut is worth the price of admission this album steve walsh has said is more of a rock album then say kerry livgren seeds of change cd thats true. but dont think there is'nt some good light moments this album has music on it in the style of music like dixie dregs, streets,elp highly recommended."
2,Schemer Dreamer = Weaker Wimpier,"I eagerly tore open the package to reveal one of the cheesiest album covers in the history of music and couldn't stop laughing. I knew it would be this way since I saw it when I bought the album--but on closer reflection, the imagery is hilariously tongue-in-cheek (I hope!). Let me say that despite being a huge vocalist-fan, and fully in Steve's corner both vocally and musically, that this album was a disappointment. The songs are okay for what they are, and Steve's voice is, of course, powerful as usual--but the songs are dull and lifeless rock-wise. Maybe I didn't research this album carefully enough before purchase, but there is nothing whatsoever rockin'--prog, or otherwise--in this album. I was expecting a little more rockin' power here. But if you want lighter-side balladeering and radio-friendly-lite pop--then buy this album---just not for these outrageous double-digit Amazon prices!!!!"
5,Healthful and Well Liked,"I have a 12 pound fluff ball and a 70 pound German Shepherd, and they both love these treats. They get one each day along with other ""required"" treats. These treats are definitely their favorite. I like them because they are low fat and not filled with fillers, so along with a quality dog food, there is less clean up in the yard."
1,Makes Dog Sick......,"Well I have a Cocker Spanial, not the brightest bulb in the box, but he's a good eater, about most everything,,,,,, Ate 2, now won't touch them,and been eating grass for the last several days, (upset stomach)Hope you have better luck.Nick AndersonKey West, Florida305-292-2974"
4,"Oldie, but goodie","This was made into a movie, which was on TCM recently. It stars Clark Gable and was a wonderful movie. Of course, it's different than reading the book. But the story is easier to follow watching people and hearing them speak. I like the old book and having it in my library. It's such a lesson about money, gambling, love, family, life n general. I first learned about it by reading another book by this auther, My Life On Earth, and I enjoyed it as well."
3,Read the small print!,"I just purchased one of these pillows (along with the comforter, etc...) and i thought i was getting a pillow with a picture of a pirate ship on it. Well, if you read the full description (which i admit i did not...) it says that the pillows are made from the same fabric as the comforter so no two pillows are alike. And guess what? My son's pillow does not have a picture of the pirate ship on it. Maybe it's just me, but i found this page a little misleading. Anyway, i just wanted to make sure no one else got surprised like I did. As to why i only gave it 3 stars, i'm also not completely crazy about the fabric. It's a little scratchy. Not awful - but not the greatest either."
5,My son loves this,I bought this with the pirate throw and pillow case - this pirate is sooo soft and comfy :) My son loves it
3,Service was great.,This product is a gift for my daughter in law who does my hair. These will be very nice for her to use when she gives me my next perm. The service was absolutely great from the shipper and the product was just what I wanted. I would order from them again.
5,Compelling Approach to a Sensitive Period in History,"Be sure to read the inside jacket summary prior to the book to set the stage for reading. The story is told in a father's protective perspective to his son, but the story behind the story is told through the illustrations.The pen and ink drawings portray more of a realistic historical view of WWI and the events leading to the armistice (prelude to peace). The simplicity of the letter protects the reader (his son) from the true horrors and hardships that the main character (the father)experiences during his medic tour of duty in Europe."
2,Coffee Table Book,"The book is divided into three chapters: India, Japan, and China. It's an easy read with nice pictures. Provides some general information on Oriental dieties, but is not in-depth or accurate enough for serious students.For example, the section on Japan contains a great deal of inaccurate information on Japanese gods and religion. Many of these mistakes are common in books written in English about Japan. (There is very little information on Japanese demons and monsters, and most of that is incorrect.)"
3,"O.K. frame, cheaply made","frame looked nice but was cheaply contsructed, if it had not been so close to christmas i would have searched for something else."
1,Who wants a pocket?,"When looking at a picture of this shirt, the pocket cannot be seen and how many people under 70 want a pocket on their golf polo shirt"
1,"never got it, but was refunded",i think someone outbid me at the last second eventhough i was told i purchased the book and my credit card was charged. i was soon notified that i did not get the book and that my credit would be replaced. no big deal but kind of a bummer.
3,re: a little dated but an impor cont to hist of journalism,"This book is a little dated as it was published in the mid-1970s but nonetheless, I recommend it not for a general audience but for those interested in studying the history of journalism. I think we take for granted journalists like Seymour Hersh for raising our consciousness about Abu Gharib but Washington journalists were not always willing to question the press offices of the DOD and Pentagon in the 1960s; Hersh reignited that tradition--which really came to fruition at the turn of the 20th tradition--of going beyond what the bureaucrats tell us and doing his own digging, digging, digging."
4,Follow the Storm,"I agree with the other reviewer...this disc is relentless. Raz Mesinai, formerly of Sub Dub, is a true musical genius. This album got pretty much zero promotion...such a shame because the quality and originality of 'Soldier of Midian' easily rivals Karsh Kale, Badmarsh, Talvin Singh, and yes even Bill Laswell. Not that the style is similar to those musicians, this is much more middle eastern, but quite frankly there are few artists I know to compare this stuff with. Those into this sound will find little that rivals it....as for me I like things with a little more of a dub feel. But..this certainly helps round out my collection."
4,Does a good job.,"I saw it done on FLICKR it actually looks really good, but you have to use it with a squeeze bottle for accuracy. See link attached for picture. Please note this is something I saw online, not something I made.[...]"
5,Very inspiring and practically useful book about life,"Reviewed by S Srikant, Bangalore, India . I read this book about 25 years ago when I was in college - found it in my college library. I found it to be very inspiring in helping people to evaluate their problems, stresses and strains and adopt a very positive and healthy outlook towards life. There are several books on this kind of subject, floating around in the marketplace - but I found this to be extremely thought-provoking, inspiring and useful in practice. Naturally, I encouraged many others to also read this book. I eventually managed to trace a copy in a bookstore and bought it - but over the years it's got lost."
1,Not worth the money,"While the software is good, its extremely overpriced. I would not pay even half the amount being asked and I am a web developer."
4,modern was/modern is,"Terrific coffee table book. Gorgeous photos with rarely published interiors of well known mid-century homes. If you don't appreciate furnishings and design of the 1950's now, you will after seeing this book! Friendly text-the reader ""gets to know"" the residents and creators of these spaces."
3,Coffee Table Book,"While the photographs offer an interesting view on the past and present use of these dwellings, we were disappointed with the quality of the writing. The book would be better if left as a photographic essay."
1,Don't bother,"Who let Cafardo write this bookTo truly understand how magical the Pats title was...one would have had to believe.Cafardo didn'tHeck, as much as I hate The Curly Haired Boyfriend Dan Shaugnessey....he would have given this team it's proper poetic justice"
5,A Must for any Boston sports fan,"High quality pictures, very much a collectible. Literature okay at best. Buy it for memorabilia not for content"
5,Sweet biography--makes you want to hear every note he played,"This is a great biography about a great player. Not necessarily a great person in all respects, but a force in music and the bass that is undeniable. This biography works because the author has both great respect and great sadness towards his subject matter. He does not praise Jaco blindly, nor does he mystify him. Jaco's glory is self-deserving--listen to any one of his bass lines. It's hard to put Jaco's playing in the proper perspective if you are introduced to it retrospectively, but that's the genius that Milkowski introduces. This book helps the reader listen to the pretty bass melody in ""A Remark You Made,"" where technique was not the issue, and truly marvel at how beautiful a bass line can be. Read this book and learn from it"
5,The eccentricities of a genius,"For those of you reading this, you are probably already familiar with the musical genius of Jaco. However, if you are like I was, you have only heard the menagerie of myths surrounding his life. In JACO, Milkowski breaks down the bariers for outsiders, like you and me, and allows us to explore the fascinating and tragic world of this modern Mozart. It is a poignant and rivetting foiray into the psyche of a tumultously and excitable man in whcih you will experience love, hate, joy, elation, and utter heartbreak as those who knew Jaco personally must have. Milkowski paints a gorgeous portrait of a young Jaco so that he may realistically tear it down with the tragedy that Jaco placed upon himself. I will never look at my own life or music the same way."
4,"Maybe somewhat inaccurate, but still a great read","I read somewhere that the Pastorius family had disputed some of the ""facts"" in this book, however, I was not able to put it down. Most of the stories related to ones I had previously heard. If you are a Jaco fan, you owe it to yourself to read this book."
5,Golden Syrup,"Las Vegas does not offer this product in the grocers like in the Southeast...Very excited to find it at Amazon. BEST golden cane syrup on the market. Very thick with awesome sweetness that makes pancakes, waffles, homemade buttermilk biscuits, english muffins, crumpets, et. al. even better. Grandmother always had it on the table ready for the biscuits straight from the oven. Homemade butter and this golden syrup made my day. Nothing else on the market compares."
4,Another good one!,"Omar tells stories once again, this is another well written book by Dave Duncan, reminiscent of the Canterbury tales."
4,Clever Delivery,Did not think the story being told was near as interesting as Duncan's very good Rap series. However the way he told the story was very entertaining and more interesting than the story they were telling. Very neat little twist at the end also (I assumed I knew how this one would end).
5,very pleased,The book was ordered as a gift. It arrived in a timely manner and it is in near new condition. Very pleased.
5,Steve Madden Sweater Slipper,"This shoe/slipper isn't just for hanging around the house. They look great with jeans, and everyone at my school is wearing them! My favorite colors of the slipper/shoe are brown and pink. Enjoy!"
3,"Compelling material, but uneven presentation","I chose this book after reading See's daughter's biographical saga On Gold Mountain. I find this compelling material (California in the 50s and 60s, alcoholism and family systems from the inside) but the delivery seems somewhat unformed to me - sort of a ""this happened, and then this happened"" mentality - less artful than I had hoped. I also hoped for more clarity by the end of the book than the beginning - not necessarily resolution, but a sense of evolution on her part. She's still drinking, still glorifying what poses as ""the wild life"" of the alcoholic (and this book is certainly evidence that the life of the alcoholic is anything but edgy and wild - it comes across as boring!) I felt compassion for these characters - especially her children - but finally was unsatisfied with her rather shallow insights about own life."
2,Dreaming--not quite a nightmare,"I was assigned this book to read prior to a memoir writing class at a summer workshop, just over. Both I and the other class members found the book unsatisfying because of its erratic organization. The pictures were helpful, but the inclusion of material not written by the author detracted from her story. The final somewhat hopeful epiphany at Clara's wedding was worth reading, but it took too long to get us there. And she's still drinking. I could not help comparing my own life on the east coast during the same years with hers; I worked hard, didn't abuse alcohol or drugs, and stayed married to the same spouse for 48 years (at last count). My career in medicine was very satisfying. I can't understand how her account of such a dysfunctional family and culture receives such applause, especially when it's difficult to follow as written. I guess we all face different choices in life."
4,Durable Blue Star Princess Costume,My neice is a normal 5 year old girl who loves to ware her new clothes as soon as they are purchased. I live at least 30 minute drive away from her so she had no idea I had purchase this costume for her to ware on halloween night for her Dad my Brother had brought her one already and she had torn it up. Well to her surprise and joy she had a costume that was very sturdy and could put up with her ruff handling. And today it is still in good shape and it is a week and two days later.
5,Quite the contrary to what rocaveli says,"I studied for the IB exam strictly from this book and received a 7. However, I can only comment on the Subject Specific Core, Option A, and Option D as those were the only sections our school had to know for the exam. I suppose the other options could have been done poorly, but if they were set up in the same way and to the same depth as SSC, A, and D then this book is the perfect tool to study for the IB exam."
3,The Weakest Series,Harry Enfield doesn't really click in this. ITV made the right choice in essentially rebooting the show with Neil Morrissey. It's still pretty funny though but really you are better off starting with series 2.
4,"Funny, off beat British humor","I like Martin Clunes so ordered this to see him in his younger days before ""William and Mary"" and ""Doc Martin"".It is funny offbeat British humor and worth watching for a laugh. I probably will only watch it this one time then donate the season to the library."
5,Anohter Overlooked Gem of a Series,"If you like British humour you really need to give this one a go. It is about a couple of guys sharing a flat and being guys. In other words drinking too much, trying ineptly to get off with women, talking bullocks and generally never growing up. Oh yes it is also about the relationship between Gary and Dorothy who stay together because....well it's hard to say really. I'm a big fan of Python, Black Adder, Red Dwarf and Bottom. If you're like me (deranged) then you'll probably love this series."
1,Couldn't watch it!,I ordered this with high expectations and anticipation because I love Marin Clunes! Our DVD player would not play the show and kept spitting the DVD out! Disappointed! The seller should have been more specific with details!
2,Simple,This tray looks much duller and very simple compared to the picture. I also had an issue with a scratch but they sent me a new mirror. I would looks at other trays more carefully next time I make a purchase and look into their refund policy
4,Exellent Floppy Drive for Laptop Users,"Its a execellent external USB floppy drive for users with laptop that don't have a internal floppy drive. Works like a charm, USB powered, and sports a very sleek design. Although it is a bit pricey for just a regular floppy drive."
3,"Using on a new iMac, sort of...","Good news...It works, basically ""plug & play"". Cute small profile.Bad news...Documentation is wrong and the provided software is less than useless.Under Mac OS9 the drive is recognized ""as is"" by the OS but the software they provide will hang your system. Works fine except the drive is not called ""Smart Disk USB floppy drive"" but it is recognized as some other manufacter's floppy drive."
2,"trouble with an iMac, OS8.6","This is not plug and play for an iMac, G3, running OS8.6. The main problem is that the documentation enclosed in the box and on the CD is misleading. It tells you to go to outdated web sites and download software that is probably on your machine anyway. It doesn't tell you to go to the SmartDisk website to download their latest driver. These drivers could have been included on their CD, but the CD is useless for Mac users. It took me two hours to solve the problem. My father, who is a novice user of this iMac, doesn't know what a driver is, and never would have been able to get this simple disk drive working. I'm sure there are tens of thousands of novice users of old iMacs who will have the same problem. So I give one star for their web site, which is well-organized, and one star for the hardware, which actually works after you spend hours downloading software."
1,Doesn't work for mac 10.5.8,"This item claims to work for mac OS X and higher, but won't work for mac 10.5.8. I can't find a driver update for this item either.The smartdisk website doesn't open."
1,Don't buy this,"We used this only twice and the poles broke. Called Colman and they refused to replace the poles stating that the poles are not under warranty and it only breaks if it is windy. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this product."
1,"Poor, poor quality poles","Just want to repeat that the poles are JUNK. I figured some of the reviewers just got a bad batch, and decided to take a chance anyway. The screen house went up like a charm - oops, except that one corner looked a little weird. But no big deal. The next day took it down after an evening with no rain, light breeze, and in a very sheltered yard. WHILE TAKING IT DOWN, one pole bent severely and two others bent slightly, but it was clear that all would be useless in two trips (maybe one). This was not poor ability on our part - we know how to set up and take down camping equipment! And I know Coleman is not a top brand, but I find it extraordinary that quality has become this poor. To their credit, the return to Amazon was quick, easy, and free. Don't waste any time or $ with this screen house."
1,dissapointment,I bought this because of the easy assembly info on the box. It's easy to assemble- you just need about 3 people. 1 of the shock cords broke when I was assembling and the whole thing came down in a crash. Will try to get Coleman to replace poles. The poles are way too weak and the whole thing is really flimsy till the screen is attached. The screen house part itself is really nice- too bad they didn't put it with a good set of poles.
2,coleman 13x11 insta-clip screen room,"I was very disappointed with this product, Coleman 13x11 Insta-Clip Screenroom. As I unpacked it out of the carrying case I noticed one of the tiedown holes was off. I deceided to give it a try and I could always fix this problem at a later date. I set up the screen room and before I could get it fully set up the tiedown tabs continued to rip off. I feel that for the price that I paid and the Coleman name a much better manufactured product would have been offered. I returned the screenroom and am awaiting a Full Refund."
2,Coleman s13x11 Insta-Clip screen,First time we put this up we had wind and one strap tore and and another tore off completly. We took it down immediately and are contacting Coleman to see how good their warranty is. Stay tuned.
1,Same problem with bending poles,"This is just to corroborate earlier reviews about the terrible quality of the steel poles. The screen room itself is great, sheds water well and is roomy enough to store all our outdoor gear PLUS a standard campsite picnic table. But, you have to be very, VERY careful putting the poles together properly, and even when you do the force of stretching the tent out to clip it to the poles can cause them to bend at the elbow joints. Once this happens the might bend back once, but after that they are weakened to the point of being unusable; plus, they rust as soon as the paint is broken from being bent. They'll also twist in the center hub at the top of the screen, making removal from the hub a wrench-inducing nightmare. Naturally, Coleman will sell you replacement poles...at $17.50 apiece. Multiply that price times FOUR poles, and I'll be buying a new screen for next season."
1,Never buy another coleman,"With some difficulty I was able to erect this screen house by myself. My bad, since the instructions recommend 2 or more people. When disassembling, a pole broke - not bent, broke. Then another pole's shock cord snapped. I was able to repair the broken pole for a second trip. When erecting the tent a third pole broke. It was unable to handle the stress when I inserted the pin at the corner of the tent.I went online for parts at Coleman's website to find that it had been discontinued. Perhaps too many complaints?I had a similar experience with a tent. I think I will try another manufacturer next time."
2,"Nicely styled, but too fragile","As soon as I had a chance after it was delivered, I decided to set up the screen house in the back yard as a trial run for camping. The directions were very clear, and even though it suggested two people for set up, I was easily able to set it up myself. I enjoyed the roominess and layout, and before long I had chairs and a table set up in it just to enjoy eating outdoors.When I went to take it down, however, disaster struck. There are no explicit instructions for taking it down, so I tried reversing the set up directions. As soon as I lowered one of the four poles, the entire structure collapsed. Three of the poles buckled and were subsequently unusable.When I contacted Coleman for support, I was told that the item was discontinued two years earlier, and that the poles were no longer in stock. They referred me to a custom tent pole fabricator, but the cost would have been excessive.Fortunately, I was able to return the item to Amazon for credit."
5,Gods Amazing Grace,"Full of truth, packed with insight, Top notch material through and through i cannot recommend this book enough."
3,"OK, most of the time . . .",The mitts are OK most of the time. It's easy to grip most things. BUT they're not so great at temps over 450. They start to melt a bit on my cast iron when I pull it out of a hot oven. You can smell them burning which is pretty unappealing.
4,Excellent Mitt for the at home cook!!!,"I picked these up awhile ago and have given them a pretty rigourous workout.From blistering trays at 450 to heavy roast pans, these mitts have proven to be durable, grip extremely well and easy to care for. Having that secure grip is great reassurance when handling something hot and or heavy.Clean up is a breeze as well. Just put them under the tap.I have tried some of the ""pro"" heavy duty silicone gloves but I found them very bulky. This is the best and worth the money.The only thing that kept it getting a 5* is that they could have been a bit longer. Hopefully the manufacturers will look into that."
2,Didn't hold up,"These oven mitts worked great for about nine months, when the tips of the thumbs ripped. For the price, they should have lasted longer."
2,Not the Best,"I'm a little disappointed with these oven mitts. They adequately protect your hands for a short amount of time, but you start to feel the heat pretty soon. The stitching is on the sides, which is a point of weakness in the design, because heat and moisture seep in. I will keep these for awhile, but I would not recommend them.Update: October 2010After about two years of use, the stitching on these oven mitts came apart, and now they are nearly useless. Again: not recommended."
5,"Gorgeous, lilting, completely perfect.","The more songs Aiji writes, the better Pierrot gets. Sure, Heaven is lighter and less 'gothic' than Private Enemy, but the memorable songwriting has improved a thousandfold. Each new song sends you to the stratosphere with its sound and melody. 'HEAVEN' kicks the album off beautifully, and it just goes uphill from there. Aiji's guitar practically makes the band; his soloing is truly incredible and original. Standout tracks are the sinfully catchy 'HOME SICK', the unbelievable riffing in 'LOVE & PEACE', and the unforgettable single 'COCOON'. I can't rave enough about this album - it's Pierrot's finest by far."
3,"It's alright, so far, a bit louder","I only had it for a few weeks, so I don't know if it's durable yet, but it seems to be louder than the previous one I purchased from another maker, which after one month no longer functioned. This one is clearly worth paying a few cents more, although no cushion on the ear piece, but that usually makes them too large to fit in the ear. Overall it's louder and more clear audibly, and might be a little more comfortable with the clip on the earlobe design, probably looks a little better than the others. Really should be reviewed after more months of trying it, so it's too soon to tell if it's going to last. I should mention that the one I received looked just a little different than the image shown, and was branded as a Verizon product."
2,not for me,"An in-ear headset is my prime priority. I feel that reception is lost with anything else, because they allow sound to come in around the pads. So, I was sold on the in-ear thingy. BUT,it clips around your earlobe and this irritated the hell out of me. If you wear earrings you're gonna have to take them off to mount the unit on your ear. I had to tell my contacts to hold on while I fooled around to get this thing on. I felt as tho it was going to fall off at any moment, and that I would have to worry about how I moved while talking. I didn't want to do this. I get too engrossed in my conversations for this. NOT FOR ME."
2,Plantronics Earbud,"Looks nice, however the recipients on the other side of the conversation commented there was a great deal of static."
4,Have tried several headsets,"My husband is a truck driver and we had tried several other products but always to much background noise still. By far out of the others this was one of the better ones but still could hear the noise, so had to finally break down and go to sprint and buy one from them. But otherwise if you use it and there isnt to much background noise then this is a good product."
1,NOT good for Xbox!,"I had gotten this mic due to some reviews on here saying it worked wonders. Well here's a review coming from someone who had ordered TWO. I ordered two of these because my husband and I play a lot of Xbox, and after receiving them, we were both disappointed when we found out we have to raise, almost shout, for the mic to pick up our voices. The packaging is terrible, they're just in a little baggy. I don't know how well they work for phones, but these definitely DON'T work well with Xbox unless you plan on yelling."
3,OK,The people I call can hear me great but it's really hard to hear them. It'll be fine to use in my quiet office but forget about using it in the car. The Plantronics UPM.... headset is a much better all-around buy.
3,OK .. If you can shout!!!,I ordered this headset for my AT&T; SL82118 DECT 6.0 Digital Cordless Telephone with Answering System. It works fine for the price. But the MIC could have been better or longer.. As it is not long enough to reach the mouth to grasp the words/sounds. I had to shout to be audible. I am going to dump this one.Not going to work if I have to shout.
1,Plantronics mx250 headset,"Not really happy with this item. First problem, I ordered the plantronics version, but they sent me the verizon version. It is much larger than expected and keeps falling off/out of my ear. It fits my husband ok but as it does not come with a cover for the ear mic it is very uncomfortable,the hard plastic ear mic has sharp edges and he is unable to make use of this item for conference calls. Overall not pleased with this product. *Will not return because of the high restocking fee*. I will not purchase from ACC stop ever!"
3,good customer service,"I recieved excelent custermer service. I liked the ear piece, I just wish that the head set would have worked for me."
3,Ear piece,Decent product and does work well - not the best sound quality and the mouth piece does not adjust as i would like.
4,Xbox 360 Headset,"I bought this as a cheap replacement for an xbox 360 headset (any 2.5mm headset should work) and it works very well. Good solid construction, decent audio, lightweight, I would recommend it if you need a different 360 headset as this is cheaper."
1,useless product,This product is useless. I can't even figure out how it works. It just falls off. I see why it says it is worth $50 but selling for $5. Actually it is worth $0.
1,Baitt and Switch,"Vibe Cellular was the vendor, but probably the rest are the same. Ordered Plantronics MX250 EarBud Universal Headset, but received a cheap knockoff that only vaguely resembled the MX250 but did not match the Plantronics quality."
1,Poor quality,Don't waste your money on this. The few I talked to complained that I was hard to hear and I had to shout so they could hear me.
3,hmmm.,"This is actually a verizon head piece and looked very nice when I recieved it. Unfortunately, the headphone jack attached to the wireless device does not fit an actual headphone jack like my phone has. It is smaller, and appears it is only meant for a phone with a special spot that can fit it. It won't work for my phone, but maybe your phone has a special plug in for it."
1,Boom broke off immediately,"This headset is barely worth the $4.12 I paid for it given the fact that the boom arm broke off the second I tried to adjust it. The quality of materials is extremely poor. The headset I recieved from Happy Cellular doesn't look like the one pictured and instead is branded with Verizon stickers that have fallen off as well. The word Plantronics is nowhere to be found on this product. If you are the kind of person who buys a UHF antenna at Radio Shack that looks like a cheap plastic dish because it looks cool, then this is the headset for you. If you expect a quality product from a company such as Plantronics, then this is NOT for you. But then, what do you expect for $5."
5,Carla in Washington state,"I bought this screenhouse 2 years ago because of its size and name and was never disappointed. We go camping 2 weeks every year at the beach with the whole family (14 people) and we were always comfortable in it. We had a 7 ft (state park)picnic table, 1-6 ft folding table, 1-4 ft table and a portable kitchen rack for the camp stove inside it. We were very comfortable and cosy. To keep the rain out and some privacy, we clipped tarps around all sides on the outside using office binder clips attaching it to the poles. Leaving one door for going in and out. This stopped 97% of the rain. Unhappily we set it up in our yard when we got back and the wind threw a branch through the top and ripped it. We are buying another one next month. My only want would be to see Coleman come up with some covers for the sides of this screehouse for privacy and weather and are easy to attach. I would buy them immediately."
2,GeoSport Screen,"I think the picture is misleading. The picture makes it appear that the tent comes with white sides also. It does not. However, the biggest problem I had with the tent is that it was very difficult to set up. It took three experienced tent campers to put this tent together. It also ""hiked up"" at the bottom allowing insects inside. I would not buy this product again."
4,Nice & durable.,"I bought this screen house/tent because our large backyard has minimal shade. This tent was pretty easy to set up. I'd say the first setup took about 45 minutes total. (Which was a little longer than I wanted.) I figure each additional setup will be shorter. This tent is very durable. We've been having high-winds all weekend and it's out back doing it's thing--taking the whipping wind. Which makes me very happy. I only gave it 4 stars because it's much smaller than I thought it would be. One other reviewer said it could hold a picnic table a couple chairs and cooler. Um--not really. We have a picnic table, 6 ft long. If I put that in there, there would be no other room what-so-ever. I'd say it fits about 4-5 chairs nicely and a cooler. This tent does it's job though. My kids and I have a shadded spot to go and a way to get away from the bugs. I'd buy it again if/when I need to."
3,Great gift for any golfer-Fun light reading,"This book is a joy to read and a perfect gift for any golfer. I have a feeling the other review on this page was written by someone who can't get his golf book published :-) The book is loaded with very current, funny stories and great celeb golf pix. One of those books you keep on the table whenever you have a moment to read a couple of quick stories. I've given this book to several golf buddies who travel and it's become a favorite ""airplane"" book. Quick read...have fun."
1,Load of crap.,This is a lot of crap about non-golfing celebrities. Who cares about Sharri Belafonte shooting 150! This book is extremely thin. No pictures. No substance. Not worth the paper its printed on.
2,no title,"Slim volume (164 pp.) about a healer in Pucallpa, Peru. Actually he is her father-in-law. Not terrific, since she reports on all this psychic healing at face value, without really tieing it to any substantive facts. These people all believe in witches and evil causing them bodily harm as a way of pushing off the problem to somebody else, much as we are so prone to lawsuits. I do think there is a definite connection between mental soundness and physical well-being. These Peruvians seem to view the world they live in as full of evil witches and people who wish them harm. Does jungle living make people so paranoid? There probably is something in psychic energy being able to heal, and people's auras telling of their illnesses; but this author does not really have enough empirical data."
5,First Person Text And Beautiful Photographs,"The author, Jim Mastro, got to spend one year at the bottom of the world and he wrote first person text and included beautiful photographs in his presentation. Some of the photographs capture the incredible beauty of Antartica and of the beauty of the wildlife."
4,what it is like to work and wonder way way down under,"This is a clearly written, funny, moving and fascinating account of what it was like for the author to work in Antarctica over a number of years. While he has told it like a one-year trip, in fact it is a distillation of 14 years experience.The book is distinguished in several respects. First, the photography is wonderful - just it is worth the price of admission. Second, there is the story of working there as a scientist, in particular the work underwater. It is really fascinating and full of quirky tidbits, like mummified seals thousands of years old or the faulty insulation of some fish. Third, there are the personal tales of what it is like for the residents, and they are harrowing not in any adventuresome sense, but in the psychological demands placed on them. Women beware of living there with so many hungry males!Warmly recomended. It is also beautifully written from a stylistic standpoint. Truly a mini-masterpiece of the genre."
4,Gorgeous voice,"Howard Keel has one of the all time great, rich, baritone voices of our time. However, having such a richness in his voice also makes certain songs rather awkward sounding. Some of his more pop renditions on this cd were such.Overall, this is indeed a great introduction to his wonderful singing."
4,"Singer, Howard Keel","I have been a fan of Howard Keel since he played Adam Pontafee in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. Imagine my delight at finding that he had finally made some DVDs of his wonderful bass voice. The DVD arrived timely and in good shape.Thanks, C. Pool"
2,Bad Re-Write,"This is a terrible, terrible re-write of the original 1999 novel.This is so cut up with product placements that the story is thrown out the window. Avoid this at all costs, and seek out the original edition."
4,Seems to work with PC but not Mac,"I purchased this cable in order to be able to transfer pictures, music, and video between the memory card on my cell phone (LG CU500) and my computer.This seems to work fine on my PC (Windows XP), with the memory card on my cell phone showing up fine as an external hard drive when I plug it in.However, I didn't have any luck doing the same with my Mac (OS X 10.5), as I get an error message when I plug in the cell phone through the cable and the cell phone is not recognized."
3,cheap plastic,"The no-pull halter does sort of work to slow my dog down, but after 2 weeks the little plastic clamp broke. So, to use the halter now, I have to wind it around, and it is less effective. Why not use metal for the clamp? I won't buy another one."
1,"If you have the first edition, there's no need to buy the second!","I liked the first edition, eventhough there were a lot of images that were repeated over and over again(I would give it 4 stars- there are no other books like this that shows all the protocols you need, so I'll give the author credit for that). I bought the new one only to find myself looking at an identical book. There were hardly any added images in the second edition and it's not worth getting. My advice, stick to the first edition if you already have it. Buy the second edition ""only"" if you don't have the first edition."
2,No indications of landmark,The pictures are good. The instructions on how to take the images are missing. No identification of landmark. Conclusion this book is not good for a student.
3,decent but not as much info as i wanted,"i like the images, and it does help with annotation, but i wish the protocol was complete like in the betty bates tempkin actual hardbound book's original school edition...i feel like i paid more than for what i got....overal its ok and practical...also wished it was actually pocket size..bigger and wider than i expected."
5,"Not for very young babies, but perfect for ""sitters!""","We bought this for use at Grandma & Grandpas house when my 7.5 mon old and I planned an extended trip to see them. We have the FP Jumperoo at the house, and while my daughter liked it, there was NO comparing her reaction to this jumper! She LOVED it. Especially since it gave her the ability to move in a gentle swaying motion, turn in circles and of course, bounce.For those who gave this a less-than-stellar review, I'd recommend:A) using this on an older baby, not a 4-5 mon old. (Keep in mind that the instructions recommed that the baby should be able to sit unassisted!) andB) use in a DOUBLE witdth doorway! There is NO WAY this could be safe in a single doorway. Baby's fingers and head would be dangerously exposed to the door frame."
5,Don't know what we would have done without it!,"We loved this product and our little girl loved it even more! We used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months. We have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in. We never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped. We believe her coordination is better because she used this so often. At just 14 months, she could jump with both feet off the ground. It is a quality product at a reasonable price. Would highly recommend."
3,Head Banger Danger,"We purchased this to replace an older Costco bouncer. I liked the toys that attached and could be removed. But if your child is in this bouncer and throws his/her head back or to the side they will hit the door frame. The Costco bouncer had a shelf around the entire bouncer so the bouncer would hit the door frame long before the child could. The front shelf on this bouncer is big enough, but there are no other shelves or buffer zones to protect the enfant.My child is average in size and fortunately has a small head so is not too top heavy. This bouncer would be better for a very large door frame. Ours are average in size."
4,Mixed reaction,"We bouth this product a couple of days ago. My daughter is seven months old. So far, she really likes Jump & Go but only AFTER we put her in the seat. She is a bit scared during the seating process. But once she is in it, she starts smiling and laughing when she turns around. Unlike a stationary entertainment center, this one doesn't take a lot of space, it's easy to put up and take down so for someone who doesn't have much space - this is the product to buy. The only thing that I dislike a lot is that the toy which goes with Jump & Go is VERY loud. We tried to tape the speaker so that the sound is a bit lower but it's hard to do because of the way the toy is. So I would not turn on the toy."
4,"You always want the best for your child, and this is close.","So many parents who review this have been complaining about children banging their heads on doorways and squishing fingers.Welcome to the world of parenting! There are going to bumps and bruises, and this isn't going to be new. Even in a wide doorway there would be bumps and bruises.Basically, if you are tired of the big exercise saucers, this is a great alternative. If you are wanting to be overprotective, don't get ANY doorway jumper!!We have a 13-month old son who has been using this for nearly 6 months now. Even when it's not on the door he will play with it on the floor. This is one of the few toys that will entertain him for over an hour. Yes, he's gone crazy and hit his head. He has also run into our coffee table and hit his head too. He cries, we encourage him to laugh, and life goes on.Does this make a coffee table or even a wall is as dangerous as this product? NOPE! Welcome to the world of bumps and bruises!!"
2,Disappointed and embarrassed,"I received the item at the time promised but the package was seriously torn apart because it was just heavy paper. A cardboard box should have contained the item. Someone had taped it all over, but I was unsure if it was damaged or if parts were missing. There was no time for adjustments. At the baby shower I had to apologize for the appearance of the item. Another person at the event had the same thing happen to their package(also sent by you!). I will never order anything from you again.."
1,HATED IT,"We are extremely unhappy with this jumper. While my daughter is in the upper percentiles for heighth, we didn't feel that we could use it @ four OR five months because the seat is so deep. She continually hit her mouth on the tray. Also, it is very hard to adjut to the right heighth. I have seen other jumpers that work much better, and we will purchase one of those!"
2,Poorly made,I bought this doorway jumper because it looked like a fun one for my daughter. We put her in it right when she was 4 months old (manufact. recomm.). She just kinda sat in it and was mouthing the edge of the seat where the fabric meets the plastic. I thought it might take her a few tries to get used to it. I proceed to take her out of it and notice that her lips are blue. Upon further inspection the whole inside of her mouth is blue! The dye from the seat leached/seeped into my baby's mouth. I returned it to Babies R Us and bought the Graco Bumper Jumper and now I am quite happy. Also the Evenflo did not bounce as easily as the Graco for some reason? I still cannot believe that Evenflo would make a product with SUCH a blatant safety issue. Makes me leery of my other Evenflo baby items.
1,Stupid design,"I read a few reviews when I bought this jump and go, some were good and some were bad. I really wanted this particular one because it had toys on it for him to play with. I had read one review that said her jump and go was fraying on the strap. I was hoping it was just hers. Well it isn't. My son is only 7 months old and the strap has already frayed enough for it to be unsafe for him to be in it. This is a very poor design. The strap rubs right up against the plastic so every time your child jumps it is wearing away on that strap that holds them up. I had a Graco one before this one and I highly recommend that one. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. You will end up having to buy another one."
1,buy your kid a concussion,"everyone's right, this is designed terribly. first thing my 6month old did was put his head back, let go of his feet, and swing to one side and knock his head on the doorway.this thing OBVIOUSLY needs a wider tray, all the way around, to prevent them from hitting their heads. i don't know what's wrong with the designers. it's so obvious i'm embarassed i even bought the thing.after reading all these reviews, if they still don't change the design, they're begging for a class action lawsuit.buy the Jumparoo. we've used that for two months, it's his favorite toy and he has never even had a minor bump."
4,"Lot of Fun, But . . .","This has been a lot of fun for our son (starting at about 4 months) for the last couple months. It has been great for him to run out some energy an dinteract with the toy that straps into the tray. We'd advise that, if yu can, to hook onto as wide as a door frame as you have. We have a double door frame that goves him a lot of room to without bumping into anything. A single door frame is a little crowded and we were constantly worried he was going to bang / hurt himself."
1,Yikes ... not the best bouncer option,"We bought this bouncer as well as an ""excer-saucer"" type. My humble advice: stick to the ""excer-saucer""'s. The doorway jumpers are inherently dangerous. The first day my son was in it, he pinched his fingers, whacked his head on the door jamb, and gnawed on the edge of the doorway. I am sure that this item had its use at one time, but I strongly feel that the excer-saucer bouncers are much better in design and safety."
2,Not the best jumper,"We were given two different jumpers and this one is far inferior - it doesn't bounce nearly as well as the Graco, which our kid LOVES. We haven't had any problems with him hitting the doorway, etc."
4,Loved this jumper!,"I purchased this jumper used and my son LOVED it...once he learned how to jump in it. I read some of the other reviews that gave it poor ratings...I mostly used the jumper in the french door opening to our bedroom so I never had a problem with him banging his head on the door frame as some of the other reviewers mentioned. I did, however, use it in single door frames and never encountered a problem either. My son is a big boy for his age, so my only regret was the short time he was able to use it. (he reached the weight limit before nine months and didn't really begin to enjoy it until he was six months old)"
4,Tons of fun for the baby,"Around 4 months of age my son wanted to stand more and wanted to jump everytime we hold him up. So we thought this would be a good toy for him. What a good choice this has been! Our baby just loves it. This is the only thing that keeps him occupied for more than 30 minutes - and that is a long time for this guy who cant hold his attention for more than 5 minutes on anything. He jumps and jumps and is so happy that he keeps squealing the whole time.Just a few things that would make it better.- Should have an easier way to put babies in and take out. (I think this is a problem in all product of this kind. )- Baby keeps moving in circles as he jumps, so top string winds itself. It would be better if the bottom part can rotate without winding the top portion.- Baby hits his head on the learning pod, so we have removed it and baby plays with it separately.All in all, its ton of fun and definitely worth the purchase. You baby will love it!!"
1,piece of junk,"The strap that attach the jumper seat to the clip that hold's it to the door frame, wears out to quickly with the day by day usage. This is the second time I have to call Evenflo about this matter, they replaced it once and this one is doing the same thing. In addition the sistem makes a lot of noise when my baby jumps. The actual issue is that when the baby jumps he also spin slowly and the strap begin to make friction wearing the elastic esealy."
4,"My son loves it, but hang it wisely","My son (who is now almost six months) at first wasn't too thrilled to be in this thing. Once he figured out how to jump, we can't hardly keep him out of it!Caution: Read the directions. I would NOT hang it in a normal-sized doorway. We have double doors leading in to our master bedroom and I hang it right in the middle. I could easily see him banging his head or pinching his hand between the seat and the door frame in a small opening. Give them lots of room!"
2,Very Difficult to Get Baby In and Out,"My 8 month old son enjoys bouncing in this seat every now and then. What drives me crazy is getting him in and out of this contraption. I have given up trying to do it by myself. It now offically takes both my husband and me. When my baby was small (4 months) it wasn't an issue, but now it is a huge obstacle. I honestly would not recommend this jumper, especially for the price."
2,Poor Design of a fun idea,"Our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed (and I'm an industrial designer Dad, so I should know!). It can hit the door frame easily, the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height. He's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it. He has fun in it at first, but it always seem a disappointment in the end. Save your time and money and get the Baby Einstein Excersaucer. THAT is a great toy and better for development skills."
1,Product needs to be used in a WIDE doorway!,"I don't have this exact product, but I have the Graco bumper jumper, which is essentially the same thing. They need to state that the product is to be used in a very wide doorway, and not a typical doorway. I tried this in a bedroom doorway (standard width) and my 4-month old hit her head on the side of the doorway when bouncing around. Take caution when using this product!"
3,Very Loud !,"I bought this toy for my twins and I think that is a great jumper, but it make way to much noise. I prefer the graco jumper much better! Much quiter!"
4,We're loving it!,"My 4.5 month old son LOVES his Jump & Go. It was a Christmas present from Santa, and my husband and I are happy with it as well. I've seen some of the reviews calling it ""dangerous"" but I think the only danger comes when parents aren't watching their children. We NEVER leave him unattended in his jumper and we've had no problems. For the first week or so he just kind of hung around in it, moving around in circles. He's finally gotten the hang of jumping and he also realizes that he's the one controlling all of the sounds. The only drawbacks I see with it, and the reason I can only give 4 out of 5 stars, is that the volume setting goes from loud to EXTREMELY loud. I wish there was one more quieter setting. Also, as with any doorway jumper, there IS a bit more potential for injury than with stationary jumpers. But as I said before, if you monitor your child, said child should be fine. I highly recommend this product!"
3,good singing but bad music,"I enjoyed the singing although some tracks took me a while to be warmed up to. That was the saving grace of the record. The backing musicians were awful. The electronic music sounded plastic and cold. It was an insult to the singers. Mr. Elliot and his friend could have done better by getting together a decent backing band rather then being supermen themselves. The strings were ghastly. The sound was pretentious. That dragged down the quality of the music.On the other hand, was Dionne on a shoe string budget with Concord Records?"
2,A Tragic End to a Long Career,"Really now, what a tragic and unnecessary recording. Having seen Ms. Warwick at the Latin Casino in N.J. in 1970 at her height, then having an opportunity to work with her on a tribute event, this saddens me terribly. Sadly, years and years of tobacco use have stunted her edge, vibrato and range substantially. The other artists were wasted on this last ditch effort to revive a fading recording career. The first reviewer mentioned that she still shines in live performance. Glimmers, maybe."
3,I like it,"If you are a Dionne fan, you already have the originals. This is a good album though. I like the trip hop-lite beat on the Reba duet. She matches perfectly with Cyndi and Gloria. I love the updated version of ""Windows of the World"". And her and Wynonna tear up ""Anyone Who Had a Heart"".Am I the only one who when I hear her and Willie Nelson's duet line on ""We are the World"" have been wishing they would do a duet for years? If there really are more installments of this coming out, I would kill if he was on it."
1,My only one star review of Dionne ever.,"Some artist make music to satisfy themself or maybe to socialize with there so call friends.This album is absord musically and conceptually and makes me angry.Let me explain,Dionne Warwick made a cd exclusively in Japan called ""Dionne Warwick Sings Dionne 2"".This cd demonstrated unequivocally that she was and is one of the finest fimale vocalist ever...an absolute masterpiece in production.This cd is now unavailable and collectors are grabbing it up on Ebay for $100.00 plus.As a life long fan and a collector i will pay more than $100.00 for this cd ""Dionne Sings Dionne 2"".Here is my problem,her finest work becomes impossible to find and here she is making music that is worthless and insulting to her serious life long fans like me.For this reason and others too numerous to mention,i will abstain from this atroscity."
2,Oh Dionne.......,"Let start of with the good...the cover! The best since her Arista Days and when Dionne wants to get all dressed up she is still a HIGH CLASS DIVA!Let's also say it is time the jokes about ""Physic Freinds"" get's put aside and this woman's Rich soundbook is remembered for being one of the all time great's.Ok....Now for the good about this cd.END OF REVIEW"
1,Caution!,This cd needs to come with a warning*****Caution for those with relative or perfect pitch this project will cause nausea.
2,what could have been...........,"As a long time fan of Dionne, I cannot recommed this cd to anyone other than die hard fans. There are much better versions of all the tracks available. If you want to hear how this album might have sounded, try Cliff Richard's 2006 duets cd ""Two's Company""...featuring Dionne Warwick on ""Anyone Who Had A Heart"". Dionne sounds so good and the production is excellent. It gives a taste of what could have been achieved in this album."
1,What was she thinking?!!!,"Perhaps I'm just getting old, and maybe I just have such a special place in my heart for Dionne's recordings from earlier in her career, but this recording just doesn't cut it.I understand the necessity and the desire to ""update"" old hits from one's singing career to make them ""sing"" to a new generation of listeners, but there is an annoying sameness to each song.The electronic instruments dominate way too much, particularly the percussion. Where's an acoustic piano? Not one horn? Not even a small string section? This must have been a pretty low budget project.If you are a Dionne Warwick fan or are eager to listen to her music for the first time, first go back to her recordings from the 60's. Then try some of her music from the ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Deja Vu"" period.But don't waste your money on this one. I hope Dionne's next project has a bit more imagination and better instrumental arrangements."
4,film underwater pictures,"This book is an extraordinary example of beautiful pictures with the highest quality, showing that film is as capable (if not better) as digital systems..."
2,Save your money,"I`ve had a number of inkjet printers over the years, but this is by far the worst one I've owned. Text quality is acceptable, and the photo quality is better than my old HP 720. The real problem is the usage of ink, particularly the black cartridges used for plain old text printing. We are going through 1 every week or two with very modest output. We used to get at least 8 weeks from the HP 720 with similar test output. I had seen a few people post that the ink usage seemed excessive, but this is ridiculous. We have spent more on black ink in the past 3 months than the cost of the printer. One other negative is that this is a fairly noisy printer, but I can live with the niose, but not the cost of the cartridges. Buyer beware !"
4,"Great printer, pricey supplies","Printing quality in Windows is excellent, you'd have to use a magnifying glass and know what to look for to notice the difference from prints produced on a lab - plus, you get to control the results.This is the first Epson printer I've used that prints better in Windows that in Linux with Gimp-print, so if you're using Linux that might be an issue. I haven't tested it on a Mac myself, so I can't comment.Only two minor quibbles. a) The software included is easy to use but doesn't give you too much control (for example, it decides what to crop off if you're printing a photo on 8.5x11 paper), which might not be a problem if you're used to doing some manual work before printing. b) The inks are pricey, not to mention the paper.Still, for the quality you get, I consider it a worthwhile investment. I've shown several borderless 8.5x11 prints to friends (printed from scanned Provia slides), and nobody has been able to tell they were done at home."
1,The worst printer I have ever used,"My parents bought me this printer to use in college and ever since the first day I have used it, it has given me nothing but grief. First I had problems with the software, and then it printed everything in a green tint. It has also eaten paper, and currently, it won't print at all. On top of that, even when it does print it does so poorly. I know my parents wanted to get me a good quality photo printer to use for my school work, but this wasn't it. I plan on going right back to HP."
3,Good for its price,"Compared to expensive printers, this one offers good value for the money. Outstanding print quality. Make sure you clean head everytime you use it (i.e. if you dont use it very often). Wastes quite a lot of ink. Havent really used generic inks. Maybe that might lower the operating costs. Bottomline, not for regular printing but recommmended for hobby printing."
1,The incredible ink-slurping printer,"Like almost everyone else on this site, I loathe this printer, primarily for its insatiable appetite for ink. Really inexcusable, how poorly this device performs."
1,Constant Clogging,"This printer would have to be the worst printer I have ever owned. Though I have never had good luck with any inkjet printer in the past, this particular printer takes the award for worst ever. The nozzles CONSTANTLY clog and you are left with gaps and smears throughout your printed pages. The only way I can get it to make a decent print is to run the head cleaning utility a minimum of 4 times before I print."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!,"This is the worst purchase I've ever made. Not only are the ink cartridges EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, they do not last very long. My printer had to be serviced twice in less than 2 years, and the last time they told me they had to replace the head, which was discontinued and would take 45 days to get. Needless to say the price for the head plus the service charge would be higher than buying a new one. So, I'm stuck with a two year old printer and two new color ink cartridges, and there is nothing I can do. THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'M BUYING AN EPSON PRINTER!!! Better of with an HP."
3,a combination of contradictory things...,"It's hard to rate this printer since I do have very ""contrasty"" emotional impressions from use of it.Pro: quality and again quality! If you are patient enough and can live with 22 minutes of the best-resolution printing of a single page, you will get what you are looking for - QUALITY. You will see the difference between 5 and 11 megapixel original files easily since this guy uses all the information hidden in 11 megapixels. Sometimes you do need an enlarging glass to see all the details printed (if you use the slow high-resolution mode mentioned above). If you use ICM settings and spend some time calibrating your monitor, the color accuracy will not cause any questions as well.Contras: 1)noisy; 2)printing head easily gets clogged and you spend such amount of time and ink cleaning it that the cost of this device will no longer look low...Conclusion: I personally will be looking for a replacement, probably from Canon brand."
2,Compatable ink,"Prints well, when all the heads are clean, however, and it will burn through vast amounts of ink to clean. If you haven’t smashed your 820 out of frustration yet, buy compatible ink off the Internet, not brand ink. It is just as good and a fraction of the price. You’ll also sleep better knowing Epson’s not sticking it to you a second time!"
2,"Nice quality prints, BUT DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","I'm going to be pretty brief on this one - I've owned this printer for good few years, and got plenty of good use out it - wow I'm being so fair to it it's not funny - I have finally reached the point where my patience with it clearly run out.Why the headache? Simple - one word - inks. This stupid machine defines the word ""unreliable"" when it comes to inks, or more likely the print heads. It will GUARANTEED screw your print just when you need it most, cause you need to clean your heads, and once you start it literally takes AT LEAST 10 cleaning cycles to actually get anywhere near clean. Many times just the cleaning of it would kill the rest of the ink in the cartridge, so you waist more time and money.I used to love Epson brand and how far they've come from the dot matrix days, but I think I'm permanently switching to Canon now. That's just sad."
2,Expensive with short life,"Worked great for the first few months, then i had to buy new ink cartridges. The most expensive ink cartridges ever, and they are soo tiny they hardly hold any ink. Severe banding started halfway through the second set of cartidges and no amount of head cleaning would fix it. Now still into the 3rd set of cartridges and the printer is pretty much garbage, I use ti mainly to print drafts. Sadly this was the case with my last epson printer as well. I think epson needs to rethink the way it designs printers."
4,Fantastic photo prints,"This printer blows away any HP photo printer with stunning results due to, among other things, the 6 color printing versus only 3 with any HP. Having had a HP P1000 prior to the EPSON P820 I can assure you of the huge difference in the photo print quality. Epson uses many more nozzles per color jet as well as varying the texture of the droplets to get truely great photos. HP also does not use black ink only mixing of the CMY inks. I use an Olympus D40Z 4 megapixel camera on a MAC G4 with Photoshop 7 and get professional looking results."
3,Epson 820 is EXCELLENT --- BUT!,"I recently bought an Epson 820 -- it seems to me to have all the virtues in abundance -- color prints on glossy paper are not to be distinguished from chemical prints. Wonderful!On the negative side it is rather slow, not only in color but in B/W as well. THEN the killer -- ENORMOUSLY expensive Ink Cartridges and an electronic chip in the cartridge which prevents it being refilled."
1,Avoid This Printer!,"I can't imagine a worse printer than the Epson Stylus Photo 820. My first black ink cartridge lasted for less than 20 pages of text. Now, on my second cartridge (which are very expensive) which is fresh from the box, the text is too light and streaky as if the ink is about to run out. The quality of photos on pricey photo paper is good, but not extraordinary. Avoid this printer. You get what you pay for."
4,"Fast, inexpensive color printer","I purchased the Epson Stylus Photo 820 Inkjet Printer because I had owned an Epson C62 before that. The C62 was fast and the print quality was good, but most of all the ink was very inexpensive. When it came time to replace it I looked for another fast printer with inexpensive ink and the Epson Photo 820 seemed to fit the bill. I have been very happy with it. It's a fairly basic printer (no flashy LCD displays or wireless features) but it is fast, the print quality is good and it's extremely inexpensive to own. The picture quality is actually better than I was expecting given that it's an older printer. It was worth every penny."
1,Truly Worthless Printer,It's junk. We got it for free with a new Mac and it's never worked properly. The print quality has always been poor and our local grocery store doesn't stock any Epson cartridges anyway. I just ordered a new HP printer and this one will go in the garbage.
1,Very disappointing,"I purchased this printer based on price and the quality of the printed photos in comparison to other printers costing up to $400. I was also quite happy with an Epson 880 I had purchased some time ago.Unfortunately, the quality doesn't last long as the color cartridge is rather quickly used up. A typical mode is to have one of the colors dry up in short order or clog, and then have to replace the whole cartridge to get a decent color balance. Integrated 5 color cartridges may be a bad idea.The unit is also very noisy and slow as it prepares to print and no speed demon when printing either.I just noticed that it was rated in last place out of 11 printers in Consumer Reports. Enough said."
1,Worst printer ever,"This is the worst printer I've ever used. The print quality on both pictures or text is [poor], to say it nicely. On pictures, the colors look nothing at all like reality. Occasionally I can get some semi-decent pictures (i.e. everyone isn't green) out but that's only after cleaning the head literally about 5 times and going through several iterations of the alignment function. Essentially, if this printer sits for more than a day, you need to go through at least 15 minutes of cleaning and alignment before you have some sort of decent printing-- whether its pictures or text. I've tried their technical support many times and it is as poor as the printer itself. I recommend staying as far away from Epson products as possible."
2,Nice quality printing but problems detecting ink cartridges.,"Works well during first three months, but quality declines for those with heavy printing needs. In addtion, develop problems in detecting replacement ink cartridges."
1,avoid like the plague,"I've not had a decent print from the printer, but at least it uses ink quickly, dries it out quickly, and requires a full color ink cartridge when you only want to print in black and white...nice design epson, guess I should have stuck with canon (like my camera)."
1,Worst printer I have ever had!,"I have never had a printer more annoying and troublesome than this printer. I love the color that Epson printers can achieve but this printer has given me so much headache.The Epson Stylus Photo 820 Inkjet Printer is incredibly noisy and cannot sit on the desk idle. It will move and adjust itself for no apparent reason, constantly. Its movement is so jerky it shakes my desk. When printing, it's slow and the printer also tends to drag in more than one sheet of paper. The printer is also extremely sensitive and just about anything can make the ink smudge on the next print out.Most Epson ink will dry out within three months or less and it's Epson's way to get more money out of you. Still though... Epson color is the best I know of if you're printing from home and to get that wonderful color that matches up to the color on your screen is no easy feat. If you really must get an Epson printer go for something a little more expensive or a newer model."
2,short life-span,"I purchased my Epson Stylus Photo 820 in February of 2002. Within a year I began to experience poor print quality. No amount of troubleshooting or head cleaning would fix the problems. In 2003 the machine began to have trouble grabbing paper, and by October it ceased to work at all. After some online research, I replaced it with a Canon."
4,Printer nice - Ink (not sure but it doesn't look good),"Ok the printer runs well, with the rebate it is cheep. The economy mode is fast and the color is good.But the ink monitor has me ready to go nuts - it indicates that all ink tanks (including black) are at the same level- so far we have been only printing B&W; at economy (360 dpi) - so if I read things right I will be throwing out a full color ink cartridge when the Black one goes dry -I have contacted Epson ER (Technical support) by their website.I will POST their reply - so all the people who are considering the printer will know how good the customer support is.Good or bad (stay tuned for the news)"
1,A short-term solution.,"I bought this model as a photo printer.This printer worked great. That is,until it quit working altogether after 3 months.I subsequently found co-workers that had the same experience with this particular printer.This is a cheaply priced printer and I think the title of this review acuurately sums up this printer. Or,you get what you pay for."
1,Good at first. Ink clogs happen often. Waste ink!!,Like other users. It was fine at first then after awhile I had to run the cleaning cycle over and over again just to get decent results. DOnt get this printer stick with something else. Canons are great and the ink is very cheap.
1,"Endlessly Aggravating, DO NOT BUY.","I've had two of these. Luckily the 2nd one I got free and it's not worth more than that. I think they get worse over time and the drivers are now outdated.1. BLACK STREAKS. When I was in school and need to print papers for class it would never work. It would refuse to feed paper or make blacks streaks down the paper vertically (this has happened with other Epsons I've had. The ink gets on the rollers and then you're out of luck unless you want to take a half hr to carefully clean with q-tips often) I had to hand those streaked papers in, when it decided to actually feed paper.2. The drivers for OSX crashes so it's hard to even use cleaning applications when you need to.3. When printing color I hardly ever get a good print without banding which renders this completely useless to me. I am an artist and need to print out sample images.4. Half your ink is wasted trying to clean the print heads over and over."
2,Skip this Printer and do your self a favor!,"DO NOT but this printer.....it ALWAYS needs to have the head cleaning utility used, and doing this, wastes all your ink! At 25+ a pop for ink, it is NOT worth it! You can NOT leave the printer off for a few days, without needing to run the nozzle cleaning util like 3 times, to print something decent!!WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!Do your self a favor, and stay clear of this printer!!"
2,Like all Epsons...,"This one suffers from the usual deficiencies:* drinking ink like a fish* noisy operation* frequently clogged nozzles* color shift when exposed to light for long periods of time* poor image quality on plain paper* poor text quality on any paperSure, six-color printing is nice - but unless you're looking at pictures from an inch away, not a good enough reason to buy an Epson. Do yourself a favor and get an HP instead. Contrary to popular myth, the newer models produce photographic quality prints that rival anything an Epson can churn out, as well as knock-out images on plain paper and superb quality text."
1,Don't wast your money !,"As stated by many others this printer does a good job printing, but it wastes ink like crazy. If you let it set for more than a couple of days it clogs up and sometimes takes 10+ cleaning cycles to get it to work again. That is if it doesn't empty the cartridge during cleaning.Pros:Does very nice photos,cheap to buyCons:Clogs too much,uses too much ink,doesn't hold much ink,refills too expensive=cost of ownership WAY too highI had one for a little over a year, and I finally had enough and got a Canon S820 to replace it. If you're thinking about buying the Epson do yourself a favor and get the Canon instead.You will be MUCH happier. Just read the reviews of the Canon on here."
1,Not a good choice,"Not a good choice in terms of quality. The nozzle of the printer needs constant cleaning to get rid of white lines. But when you clean it and print out the patterns to check results, it use up the inks. It takes about 4 times to fully clean the nozzle which consumes 10% of a newly replaced ink cartridge. I am a disappointed user and would not recommend this product."
2,NOT a printer to depend on....,"I'm currently late for work, trying to get something to print for my job. It's a report with pictures, and this printer, for the umpteenth time, is having problems with keeping the print head clean. I've been through the cleaning utility about 10 times this morning.This is a problem that plagues this printer, and it only matters when it's crunch time. No problems when there's not a deadline, but I have people at my office waiting on me, wasting our time and money, because I depended on this printer. Never had such a problem with one of the HP printers, and will look into a purchase of one of their models for the workplace."
2,"clogs, clogs, clogs, clogging, drinks ink.",Have used up all my ink running the thing through cleaningcycles. No way to just clean the black cart- it goes throughboth carts on a cycle- a huge waste of ink. Was clogged rightout of the box. I am sending this thing back to Epson
2,my most cantankerous printer ever,"I've got to ditto the other reviewers who had communication problems and inconsistencies. Some of the prints were gorgeous, and some of them had completely dropped colors. Sometimes it would not print text, unless I had just run the nozzle cleaner utility, and then not again ten minutes later. A brand new cartridge did the same thing. Sometimes, as others have noted, it stops halfway through and ejects the paper. I haven't got to the point of gauging the ink usage...it's going back!"
2,inka-drinka,"Consider this: printing at 720 dpi, on Epson photo-quality paper, I am only able to print about 30 pages (with one 4x5 image per page) per color cartridge. That means it costs over a dollar a page for the color ink alone! Beware.But they sure do look nice."
3,Good B&W comic --,"-- but just didn't grab me.B&W; is good, or can be. No problem there. Drawing, photos, and photoshop stuff work for me too, some times. And so does non-linear storytelling, as long as I have some thread to hold onto.This combination just ddn't come together for me, though. Drawing and photo mixes never looked finished, scan-lined flashbacks (flashforwards? flashes?) sat poorly in context.There's a lot of energy here. Just not a lot of skill in either narration or visual storytelling. I look forward to truly enjoyable stories from this artistic team, given some more experience.//wiredwierd"
2,it is not universal at all,"The quality is good. However, it is not universal at all notwithstanding the ad on Amazon. It does not fit my 22"" Toro. Even with washers, the blade does not sit tightly on the profiled basis--the blade is flat!"
2,Dull and Ineffective,"Was looking forward to receiving this blade as my old one had reached the end of its useful life. This blade came with a warning regarding using gloves to handle it due to the sharpness of the blade...could not be further from the truth...so dull would likely not cut softened butter. With each pass on the grass this blade left a lot of uncut grass and did not cut nearly as efficiently as even my old dented and dull blade. I was not impressed with the cut on this at all and will go out and get a regular replacement blade for the mower. Do not waste the $15 on this blade, not worth it."
3,"Okay, not as funny as his older stuff","This is not John's funniest stuff, but good for a few chuckles. He gets distracted at times and does not return to the original train of thought to complete the story. The extras are not worth watching."
3,John Pinette: Still Hungry,"I like John Pinette, however, I did not care for him using the F word in this DVD. This was my 3th John Pinette DVD. I think his ""I'm Starvin"" is his best one.Shirley"
5,John Pinette,"I bought this for my hubby for Christmas and have come to love John Pinette by default. He is funny, honest, and not over the top with profanity, which is a nice change."
1,great movie,"I love John Pinette and i love the fact that his DVDs are available on amazon.com, because you cant buy them in stores right now."
3,Just not as good...,"Still Hungry has its moments but it seems to drag at times. Pinette seemed lost during the performance , like he was trying to figure out the bit to do next. In the final 20 minutes he finds his groove and you get some great laughs. If you were to buy a stand-up DVD for a friend, don't get this. Buy his other DVD, I'M STARVIN'!"
2,Below Standard,"After seeing ""I'm Starvin'"" ""Still Hungry"" is a big let down. There are a few humorous moments, but none of the side splitting laughter generated be ""I'm Starvin'"". I really like John Pinette, but he could have done better."
4,good but not quite as good as first dvd,"This dvd was very funny. Compared to his first dvd, however, didnt quite live up to that. Same type of skit based upon food which is always a crowd pleaser. All in all very funny performance and would recommend to any Pinette fan."
4,"Funny, Funny Stuff","John Pinette Is A Comic Genius. Never A Dull Moment, And Belly Laughs Galore. This Is A Must Have For Anyone Who Loves Stand Up."
1,Not nearly as good as 'I'm Starvin'.,"Many of the lines on this DVD are the same as he used in the I'm Starvin DVD - it was not as funny as watching his prior routine.I wish whomever is John's manager would get NEW materials together and offer a DVD that is fresh and alive with John's humor.I'd say it was not worth it to make this purchase, though we still LOVE John !"
1,Far from the original!,"John was not having his A-game when he filmed this one. We have loved both of John Pinette's other DVDs, but this one missed the mark. I was so disappointed with all the F-bombs he dropped throughout this new DVD. I hope he soon makes another one doing what he does best....Funny! He has never had to be vulgar to try and pull off funny...however for some reason he has so much bad language in this one, it made it repulsive instead of funny! I would NEVER recommend this DVD to anyone."
3,GOOD FOR A LAUGH,GREAT ...HOWEVER TO THERE WAS TO MUCH DUPLICATION OF HIS FIRST ONE. I THOUGHT THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL ONE PUT OUT ALREADY
2,Dumb Comedy,John Pinette does the same routines in all his performances. He just makes fun of fat people and he's one of them. His humor is deplorable.
5,John Pinette: Still Hungry,"I like the video it was very funny. No bad words ,no sex just something to make you laugh at. I give this to anyone who need a good laugh."
5,Great Find,Great find on a very hard to find item. Decent price. K&N doesn't even list a filter for the '07 Audi A6 anymore (but this is it).
5,Come Spring,"Set right in my own home state, with characters seeming just as real as the towns which are familiar to me."
4,Songs on this CD,The tracks on this CD are as follows:1. Wahdani2. Lamouni3. Omrak4. El Sho25. Belkhir6. Matetgharesh7. Akrab Saheb8. Al Gharam9. Leh Al Layali10. Aletly Khalas11. Nesetni12. Nar el Hawa
5,Good selection,"Growing up, I'm sorry to say that I missed all of these songs except ""Venus"". Had this band's record company promoted them better in the U.S. back in the day, they would have been huge. Sadly, I only found out recently how good they really were, and this compilation goes a long way to let the listener hear what he/she has been missing. ""Venus"" sounds better and catchier than I originally remember, along with songs like ""Love Buzz"" and a solid ""Shocking You."" As with any compilation there will be stronger and lesser songs, and this CD is no different. However, the majority of the music stands the test of time with simple lyrics and musicianship second-to-none. Mariska Veres is able to capture a wide range of emotion in her vocals, and her English is nearly perfect. Sadly, Mariska passed away in 2006, but we all can celebrate her life in her music, and this best-of collection is a great addition to ""Shocking Blue's"" other CDs or 60s and 70s music in general."
4,Love good oldies,I got to have this 1970's classic rock from the Netherlands and saw them live concert. The great classic rock and roll music. Love every minutes of their music. I am glad I bought it from Amazon.
2,The Red Wheelbarrow,"I really don't see how anyone can say that William Carlos Williams' ""The Red Wheelbarrow"" is an outstanding peice of work. I'm not going to trash the rest of his work because I find some of it to be quite good, but I would love to know how on earth that poem got published. I find it pointless and quite frankly, boring. And how people get three-page analyses of this poem leaves me in utter amazement that there actually are people with no life."
5,Excellent work,I got a copy of this book during JavaOne 2004. I think the book provides a nice background on transactions processing and how it can be applied in Java and J2EE applications.
3,It will get you started...,"This book will get you started working with JTP... however, it's not going to get you through a professional application.If you're new to a lot of transaction processing or just transaction processing in Java, this is something you've got to breeze through at least once. Once you start getting deeply into the nitty-gritty of your application, it's complexities, etc. you're going to find that the book starts to fall short.It's not to say that the book lacks examples, it just won't contain what **YOUR** application is going to need. The book does not nearly do justice nor spend nearly enough time talking about the complexities you are going to run across when working with enterprise-grade transactional processing in Java.Beginners: go for itIntermediates: there's better resources, but it may be worth it for youAdvanced: ignore it"
2,Waste of money,Bought this book at JavaONE. This book is 80% theory which you can google around to find it and rest of them shows some sample scenarios very hard to understand. I find once you have finished reading this book you are able to do nothing.
4,Very Underated,"This is a very good cd. Coupled with Laid Back and you have the best of Greg's work from that period. It is kind of short for a cd but it was an album full of great music. Not a bad cut on the cd, Come and Go Blues, Cryin' Shame, etc. Enjoy!"
4,GT Still Going Strong,"This GT video is great, but not as good as Affliction (The First GT Video). The fight between General Rilldo and Goku drags on. The fight, in my opinion, is a little boring. However, in the very last episode on this tape, The Baby Secret, we finally get to see Baby itself. Right before the video ends, it shows something I didn't expect- Baby takes over Dr. Myu! I give this video 4 stars because the first episode is just a little boring."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"FUNimation has once again ruined another great anime series. I bought the first DVD and was confused when the first episode wasn't like the Japanese version. The DVD says uncut in both Japanese and English language but the first episode is only in English and censored. Don't waste your money on this garbage, if all you want is the English Dubbed censored version, just wait until it comes on Cartoon Network."
2,To Disapointing,"There is a major flaw in the premis of Dragon Ball GT, or at least the early goings. That problem is that it copies many of the things done in Z. Am I wrong, or just not getting it. LEt me explain.In this DVD Goku has finished off the Sigma Force 5, from there he faces off against Genreal Rildu and eventually encounters Baby and Dr. Miyu. Goku, Trunks, and Pan destroy a form of Baby and then leave. In the End Dr. Miyu is killed when baby ripps itself out of him.The reason this to closley resembles stuff done in Z is because of the villians.1: SIgma force 5 - Ginyu Force2: Genral Rildu - Cell/ Super Android 13/ Frieza3: Dr. Miyu - Dr. Gero4: Baby - CellThe primary villians to closly resemble past villians that any intrist in the battle soon subsides. I am very disapointed in this series and will catch it on TV, not worth purchasing."
5,"Extremely helpful, well written","Studying for my MBA at the University of Michigan, case studies were frequently used to learn effective business practices. This book clearly shows how today's technology can help solve one of business' thorniest problems - efficient and cost effective purchasing."
3,'Natural' isn't likely to be white,"I haven't seen this item, but I buy a lot of this type of paper. Just a small warning: 'natural' kraft isn't likely to be white. Note the photo.Pacon 5836 Kraft Paper Roll, 50-lb. White Kraft, 36"" x 1,000 ft. roll should probably be re-labeled 'Natural Kraft'."
4,"Ibiza on Ice (Chilled + Very, very cool!)","This is an album of very good feeling. At first, I was sceptical of this album; I wasn't sure it would be able to better first volume. Sure enough after hearing the chilling sounds of: Sabres of Paradise's Orchestral 'Haunted Dancefloor'; the sublime, more upbeat poetry of Paco De Lucia's, no-frills Spanish guitar and bong piece 'Entre Dos Aguas'... I was convinced. I feel like with the other café del mar compilations, outside Ibiza, José Padilla and the music associated with him have not basked in the sunlight of recognition deserved. Café del mar 1 may have the slight edge - but the feel is not lost here - and there are, like in every volume- a few exceptional gems."
3,This is not Pasolini's best,"Although it is a good movie and definitely worthwhile seeing it, it's not the best of Pasolini. Yes, it is stylish, but the whole impression is rather good than excellent. Of course, it's not for Hollywood gang, so give it a miss if you like mass production. For those who like Pasolini it's definitely an asset."
1,not the original version of porcile,"The copy of the film has not the original montage (I know that because I know the original film). Instead the sequences are put together partly in the wrong sequency (for example: people are being arrested after they have been executed in the scene before)! Apart from that you see edit gaps of the film reel after every sequence! And also the sound is extremely bad, there's a loud humming on the whole film."
3,everything you need to know about visiting Disney World.,"This was a fun little book. I liked how it had up-to-date info about ticket prices and other stuff. The author does put to many of his ideas of what you SHOULD do there - for instance there are plans for everything. Even so, this smaller guide probably has all the info you need to know to have a great vacation. I would reccomend it."
2,Mini Mickey proves disappointing,"Being a Disney cast member, I thought the idea of a pocket-sized guide to Disney would be great for guests coming to Walt Disney World. However, this book -like Birnbaum's- proved to be disappointing. There was much more projection than there were of facts. Every page contains at least one un-truth, which researched more throughly, and in some cases even at all, would have been of great help to those adamently reading this book. Also, almost every shread of information about Disney's new theme park Animal Kingdom seems to be made up, considering the book went to presses several months before even the soft opening for press members. Even though, I am bashing this book, the idea is good, if only someone seriously went to Disney and wrote it with real information."
1,Not blues...and very dated sounding,"I love Anthony's live shows but something stikes me as very dated and cliched about this disc. First of all, it is not the great blues-rock and funk we have all come to love and expect out of him. While I certainly respect his ambition to take his music in new directions, this effort falls completely flat. Most of the tunes sound like rehashed pop-rock from the early 80's. Mr. Gomes, it is 2006, would you please join us?Not his best work by a long shot."
5,Therapy for the soul,"Once again, Anthony Gomes shines through with his latest CD; so unique in it's blend of musical styles. But don't let the funk, blues, rock and searing guitar solos fool you. Behind the great music are even greater lyrics; lyrics carrying a message that truly inspires.This CD is must have therapy for the heart and soul. It will lift your spirits to new heights.Anthony dishes out good medicine, the more you take, the better you'll feel !.....finally, a medicine that is safe at any dose !Tony T"
5,Music Is The Medicine,This high energy Cd will have you up and dancing no matter where you are! Anthony Gomes' music truely is the medicine! This is a must have CD to bring a smile to your life!
5,Shake your tail feather,"This CD is a great mix of rock, funk, blues. It's unique and really captures the power & energy of their live performances too."
5,Read the Fine Manual,"Step by step strategies in clear language that get to some essential practical techniques to carry on a dialog about violence. As a parent I know it can be difficult to understand how to start to talk with children to get through to them. This book offers useful variations. When all else fails, read the manual!Thanks to Dominic Cappello for the cool coaster that came with my copy!"
1,a picture's worth a thosand words,"I could have made the designs by looking at the pictures.The print is small,not even standard size type.Then they do things like green type on green pages.VERY hard to read.Cindy"
4,"Great looking shoe, not that comfortable","This shoe looks fabulous either with jeans of with a more elegant outfit. However, standing and walking in these shoes may hurt after a couple of hours. Think about it."
1,At least it looks alright,"Simply put, it doesn't work. I got this for my dad the christmas, along with a Toshiba camera, and new (128mb) smart media memory card. Being an aesthetic freak, i have to say that it does look kinda cool, but thats where my praise ends. Of course, it may be a defective one, but i've got to report on the one that I got. We're not really sure why it doesn't work, it could be the fact that the connector is really loose in the unit itself, or maybe the build quality is just bad. I really would not suggest you buy this, as it doesn't work (for me at least), and it just sems to ooze cheapness and poor build quality. Do ourself a favor and check out one either here, or try somewhere else, like Directron.com for a smart media specific one, its up to you."
1,It should read Dear Diary... lol,"The book STARTS ok, but soon becomes a jumbled mess. With this hefty price tag I was expecting more. Spelling, grammarical errors and unorganized thoughts drove me nuts. It was actually VERY difficult and annoying to read at the end. It reads more like a diary of a bitter, slightly psychotic woman trying to justify and validate herself, or at least convince you that everyone else is nuts and she is not. What I found most interesting is that the ""dirt"" she spills including details of an ""orgy"" leads the reader to wonder if it was taken from another book ""Bunny Tales"" since she talks about the EXACT same night. Odd.It is NOT worth the price. I got a copy from a friend so it was free to me, even then.. there's a week of my life I will never get back..lol"
4,Nothing new,"There is nothing new here. Miki Garcia, Miss January 1973, made similar observations concerning Hefner back in the mid 1980's. She claimed that she knew of many Playmates who had performed in orgies to please Hefner. I remember seeing an interview of her on television. What impressed me is that she was an intelligent, articulate women."
3,More Jill Ann than Hef,"The book was okay. I downloaded it free from Jill Ann as an ebook and am glad I did not pay for it. The book is mostly about her quest to become a bunny as opposed to what really goes on. It does have juicy bedroom things, but that is only a small percentage of the book. The book overall makes me feel sorry for Jill Ann. She was very obsessed and still seems to be with playboy. Most of the time she seemed like a desperate little girl wanting attention. She brags throughout the book about how good looking she is. We can see that for ourselves by looking at pictures."
1,Wish I'd never bought it,I wish I had never bought this device. Somehow it passed current up through the antenna lead and caused several fuses to blow. I'm still trying to repair the damage.
3,FM Modulator,The FM modulator was easy to install. I have had no issues with it. I was a little nervous when I got it about getting the feedback static. I was impressed that there was little to no feedback. Over all for the price it was a good buy.
5,NOTHING LESS THAN A MASTERPIECE,"This film has few equals, French or otherwise. The tragic emptiness and aimlessness that the characters struggle with leaves a very disturbing, haunting impression. Although explicit at certain brief moments, this is certainly not a film that is intended primarily for a homosexual audience. It can appeal to anyone. Of all the movies I have seen this one reminds me the most of the Dutch film ""Spetters"", in its depiction of just how bleak life can be for those who can not find their way in it."
4,"If you want porn, move on","I think we expect films about gay people to be ""sexy"" and L'Homme Blesse is not. One reviewer mentions that in a simulated sex act one actor sucks his own thumb--as if this were incompetent film making rather than being the plot point it is. (The character is faking having sex--he refuses to have real sex with the main character though they are frequently in erotic situations.)Without being ""sexy"" the film is erotic. But since the desire is unrequited, the ""cute boys in their underpants"" crowd will be disappointed."
3,kinder and gentler CYOA,"This is a relatively easy read and isn't as dark or sophisticated as 'Your Code Name is Jonah' or 'Space and Beyond'. Since the hero is a kid, it's hard to get killed unless you try to make the Indians angry. There are a number of quick happy endings. Some of the other endings are ho-hum. Malloy, the sharp teethed bandit, isn't all that hard to beat unless you try to do gun battle with him, and even then he doesn't kill you (you're just a kid, remember?). The book is not all that bad, but adults would want to find nostalgia with the other books and leave this one for the little kiddies."
1,doesnt play in scotland,after waiting so long for this game and paying 18 pound for it to get it here it doesnt even play on my x box wrong code not happy and only rate it because a have to to send this mnessage
5,Over the top!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This album should have been the soudtrack to that armwrestling movie called ""over the top"" because it gets you PUMPED UP! Arm- breaking beats mixed with tendon-rippin' metal guitar riffs. It's hot I tell you. If you ever liked anything Crystal Method did or the Chemical Bros. buy this and prepare to be impressed, because it's more intense than anything those guys ever did."
4,A piece of good music,"If you want to search for the prolognation of Hendrix's work ,let me reduce your exertion .DISCIPLIN A KITCHME is what you are searching for.Plus you will find some extra vibes that you can dance too .Drums played in a house way,vocals fool of soul and irreplaceable Koja's bass are basic elements of this group whose roots are somewhere in Belgrade at the begining of eighties."
3,There's a better Stealers Wheel collection available,"This ""Best Of"" is the NOT the definitive Stealers Wheel collection. You may want to steer yourself to ""Stuck in the Middle with You,"" the 2000 Polygram International release that is the first to include ""Stuck In The Middle With You,"" ""Star"" and ""Everyone's Agreed That Everything Will Turn Out Fine,"" Stealers Wheel's three charting American Singles. (Note that ""Fine"" is not on this particular set.)Also worth noting, both the debut ""Stealers Wheel"" and ""Ferguslie Park"" are back in print, on CD for the first time."
2,"Just remember that this is a USB 1 hub, not USB 2.0","Once you realize what I mentioned in the title, make sure you realize that USB 1 is VERY slow. Last century slow. Sure, it installed without compatibility issues and it chugs along just fine with solid build quality.But there is no reason to buy this product unless you have some unique legacy hardware or otherwise are looking for a blast from the past and a chance relive those heady days of the late 90s internet revolution.If you want to transfer files or use a new printer, get something else- it's not even that cheap."
4,Scribe your thoughts here!,"This journal is a pretty worthwhile choice if you're looking for a blank book to fill with your thoughts. The graphic on the front is interesting, even if it's not spectacular. However, it is suitable for just about anything you feel like writing. Poetry, stories, letters, or a diary are examples of what you could make out of these pages. If you've heard the saying, ""Life is an open book,"" then fill up those pages!"
5,Wow... best bang for your buck!,"I was a little hesitant about purchasing this kit because of the previous review, but after seeing the quality of the images and how consistent Pacific Dualies is at putting actual images of their products online; figured that it was worth doing my own research rather than relying on a lone rogue review. I went to the manufacturer website and found that they're a very reputable company. After talking to one of Customer Reps Danny, he confirmed that the this kit was for my application and he went the whole nine yards to explain how the kit would fit and even recommended things about wheel weights and avoid valve stem extension if I'm running stock rubber ones.Anyways, I was sold on them and they arrived today. I opened the box and literally 15 minutes later, I had them on and my RV. No problems.Definitely worth the money!"
1,Non-Working Vaccuum,This vaccuum did not work at all once I placed the batteries inside it. I was very unsatisfied with this purchase.
5,Well made,This sprayer holds pressure a long time. Pump is easy to operate. Padded strap helps ease the pressure on your shoulder.
2,high quality sprayer,"Sprayer are high quality, but SP would not take care of wand, that new out of the box, had a bad seat, causing it to leak constantly. I still can't believe they wouldn't replace it. I buy Chapin from now on!"
3,Better than a really bad hammer,"The handle does not fit my hand well, but I suspect the handle I got wouldn't fit anyone's hand well; there was a prominent ridge that was uncomfortable in my palm. The handle was also not finished very well; adequate, but that's all. I have reshaped and refinished the handle, but it's only better, not good. It is not balanced as well as other hammers I own (I have about a dozen hammers that could be called finish hammers.). Some people like that stubby little head, but it restricts the versatility of the tool; you wouldn't be able to put nails through the back of a receptacle box for instance. It didn't seem to be an especially effective nail puller. Overall I would say it will work for light nailing in most situations, but it wouldn't be my first choice. The hammer I like best of all the finish type hammers I have is the Shark Corp 20-2110; it looks weird, but I find it far superior to this one."
4,Good how-to book,"This is a good, solid work that will be of interest to the beginning to intermediate fly fisherman. It's clearly written and gives good advice. The illustrations are clear and useful. If you want to give nymph fishing a try, or improve your basic skills, you won't go wrong with this book."
3,The Lone Stranger,There is a long tradition of the dead guy who ( should/ could/ would)come back and reap revenge on the bad guys. In this casea gang of drug running bikers who support the local villain and hisgang. On tall blond and middle aged biker cleans the streetsof the murdering bikers and leaves down the road.It is western hero on a hog time again...
4,Dolph is a Missionary Man!!!!,"This is a good, dark actually stylish and competent movie! Dolph continues to try and add depth to his ""movies""; with this one he achieves just that!! Of course when he beats the redneck, backwater trash, town savages it's a bible-thumping they've never had; but ALWAYS wanted; that much is clear!!!!! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Awful waste of time!,"This was so bad it could almost be listed as a comedy. Dolph Lundgren's career peaked at Rocky IV and he should have retired then. His directing is as ""good"" as his acting. Overused cliches are abundant, wooden acting, predictable plot, ""artsy"" video quality, and more melodrama than you can stomach make even bad B movies look good by comparison."
1,AWFUL!,"The heroine's sister seducing the hero, knowing that he thinks she's the heroine, just leaves a really bad taste in my mouth. Then she leaves her sister to raise the hero's baby! A boy, his heir, nonetheless! This completely ruins the book. On top of that the whorish sister is allowed to get off free and clear and marry the man she loves, and her husband remains blissfully unaware. Meanwhile, the heroine settles for her sister's seconds. It's disgusing. She's a complete doormat. There's no way around it."
2,"Mediocre, at best","The plot is excellent and very original compared to most Regency/Historical novels, but the characters were poorly developed. I made myself finish the book because I wanted to see how the author maneuvered them out of their webs, but I didn't really care about the hero/heroine.The heroine was unbelievably 'good' and the hero's redeeming qualities were never demonstrated. He rescues the heroine a couple times, and it seems like that's the only reason she loves him. We read, over and over again, that he is kind and noble and honest - really?? There's absolutely no evidence of that until the very last few pages and the expected happy ending.Overall, I was impressed with the author attempting such a bold plotline, but the character development got left behind. This was my first Brenda Joyce book...and may or may not be my last."
2,Boring....first Brenda Joyce book I did not complete,"Unfortunately, I did not like Lizzie. She was oblivious to reality and acted totally stupid. This story just could not keep my interest. Because of my limited free time, I decided it was not worth wasting time on these unlikable characters. Sorry Joyce, but for me this was not a winner. You're still a great writer and I look forward to your next new work."
2,2 1/2 stars,"I have loved every Brenda Joyce book I've read to date until this one. She strayed from her usual format to give us only one (Lizzie's)point-of-view for the entire first half of the book. We know very little of what Tyrell is thinking or feeling until about the 11th chapter. By that time, you have formed an opinion of him and the other characters and story line have already been developed. This made Tyrell seem shallow and one-dimensional. Even afterwards we never really know what's going on in his head.I found myself skimming over parts I felt were added to make the book longer. Usually I read BJ's novels in about a day and am sad to see it end, but this one was a struggle to finish. Brenda Joyce has done much better work than ""The Masquerade""."
1,I JUS DONT FEEL IT!!!!,"this book lacks lusterits like any other typical romance novelwhat happen to brenda's fiery love scenes?and the hero is darn dissapointinghe deserves the dumb heroineP.S-if u want to read a real b.d book,read the Promise Of The Rose"
3,"unoriginal, partly forced, terrible editor","I am a longtime Brenda Joyce fan. I even liked The Third Heiress and House of Dreams (which I could not put down) although I noticed many of her fans did not like them. I would have accepted the complete ""borrowing"" of setting and plot from Pride and Prejudice, and would have considered Masquerade a rewriting of Jane Austen in contemporary romance style if it would have been a good rewrite. Most of Joyce's novels are so good I would have considered her perfectly suited to write it. However, aside from varios editing mistakes (Brenda, please get yourself another editor! For your sake and ours.), I simply did not find it believable enough, strong enough, or good enough."
2,"Is this not the ""Promise of the Rose"" continuation??????","I have read the book Promise of the Rose and one of the main character there is named Stephen de Warenne. Now, this book has in the description that this is after the book entitled ""The Price"". The Price have an entirely different characters and character names and not one of them is a de Warenne as far as I remember. I don't know what rating I should give this book since I have not really read it. I just want to make a point to everyone who is interested in reading this that the de Warenne is a character from the book ""Promise of the Rose"". The mention of ""after The Prize"" is kinda misleading to everyone. So please, read the Promise of the Rose, it is a good book too. The Game is also phenomenal, very hot and sexy!!!"
3,Not her best work ...but still enjoyable,"I was first captivated by this Author when I stumbled across ""The Game"" which was exciting, interesting and not predictable....in contrast to this one. Masquerade was enjoyable enough, as all the Joyce books are and I have read them all except one. This Author is so talented; seems like she is holding back here. FOr future works, I hope she will focus more on advanced plot intrigue and character examination and less on the endless pages of trivial female emotion by heroines who don't seem to eat or sleep which seem like fill pages to me."
5,A practical book for the biginners and skilled players,"I have played GO for a long time.Although this book is a introduction to the game, it is also a great help for skilled players.It's usefull studying again the actual method and the meaning of the moves.It is great fun reading the historical story of the Honnoji Temple affair related to the tripple ko.Anyone of you might found it important to study the josekis and memorise them.But I found it important to replay the actual games.Learning all of the moves by heart, then repeat to put stones to the end of the game.This book has an excellent example game, which was played between Cho Chikun and Kato Masao, who is a rival of Cho.It's usefull studying and also worth learning all of the moves by heart."
2,mediocre at best,I don't know who really writes these reviews because this book did not deserve anything better than two stars. I know; its a harlequin what did I expect. The problem is that for a silloutte desire there was desire. It could easily have been a love inspired or religious harlequin. The story was ok and characters likeable but dull and I skimmed most of the second half. In summary it is sweet but boring.
1,Horrible Product,Do not use this product on your camera lens! It leaves a milky film and streaks that are very difficult to remove! I almost ruined my camera using it. Digital Concepts ought to be ashamed of themselves putting out such a shoddy and destructive product when they are supposed to be digital camera experts.
2,Pretty basic and getting out of date...,"Potential readers should be aware of two facts about the first edition: (1) There is NO mention of the Palm III or O.S. 3; happily, much of what is true of the Palm Pilot carries over to the Palm III, but how is one to know what?; (2) Some 183 pages of the 320 pages of text (57% of the book!!) is devoted to descriptions of third party software. (3) In many cases SEVERAL versions of the shareware/freeware have come and gone since the version numbers mentioned in the text. More current information is readily available on the web. (4) Many problems in Chapter 4 (Troubleshooting...) refer to long dead versions of the operating system. [New problems await you ;)] In short, a ho-hum, sort of like reading about Lotus 1a, or WordPerfect 5.1, or dBaseII."
1,An Incomplete Disappointment,I purchased this book and was roundly disappointed by its muddy writing and neverending review of out-of-date software. I felt misled and humiliated for spending money on this book when most of what comprises the text can be found for free on the internet.
1,A very bacic book,"The Complete Palm Pilot is a very simplistic manual that is written for a computer beginner using the Palm Pilot. It lacks detailed information on basic concepts including ""graffiti"" and other details that even a novice will need. A major part of the manual is devoted to a very basic descriptions of add-on programs. In summery, this book is too simple for even beginners and I do not recommend it."
2,Not worth it,"I was looking forward to Mr. Parker's book on the PalmPilot, the most useful PDA I have used. I was dissapointed. There is very little information in the book that could not be obtained by reading the manual or just playing with the Pilot. Much of the book is devoted to cataloging software available- this information is readily available for free on the Internet. The software on the CD-ROM has a few good programs but unless you want lots of silly games, several Periodic Tables of the Elements or many calculators it is waste. I do not get the impression that much thought went into software selection or even the book. As Mr. Parker states, those WITHOUT Intenet access will find this book most useful. If you can read this review, that counts you out."
4,interesting read,"This book is very interesting to read, since it covers a broad range of information about Multiplayer Gaming. But you shouldn't expect every MM secret to be lighted up in this one book. It is a book with dozends of chapters about many aspects of MM gaming, so it is a good starting point to enter the topic and get a broader knowledge of what MM games are and what aspects you have to think about. In my opinion, you will need more books in addition to this (such as the gem series or MM2)."
4,Very good for game developers,"This is a very good book for experienced game developers.If you are looking though, for a an intro text, this is not it. This is for serious programmers."
5,Moses and the Gods of Egypt : Studies in Exodus,I am teaching the kids in a Bible Study (BSF) and noticed that the notes had quoted this book.I bought a copy and it is a great reference for studying The Life of Moses.Highly recommended!
1,Merely regurgitates Oracle's documentation.,"This book merely regurgitates the freely available documentation from Oracle. However, this book is even worse since its space limitations means that the author is forced to be even more cryptic than the already difficult to understand product documentation. I could not find anything useful in this book - the book doesn't explain anything. Nothing at all. Aren't books like these supposed to simplify concepts for nonexperts or beginners? Forget about this book. Download the free documentation and use the money to print that out at Kinko's instead."
5,long road home,"as usual,all Fogerty stuff is top notch to me. I've been a fan since I first heard Proud Mary back in '69 I think it was, and I still can't get enough of him. Hope he tours New Zealand again soon. There wouldn't be anything of his I haven't got. Cheers, Phil, New Zealand"
1,"Played too fast, too shakey","Like many of you, I loved CCR. The songs were relics of the past and well crafted. They were played at a very slow tempo, and that was a crucial part of their flavour and mystique.Now we have this live recording called the ""Long Road Home"". It is obvious that John has aged. He can no longer carry the notes or the inflection that he did in CCR. So be it.But, what I can not get past on this album is the frantic speed at which every song is played. The material loses its authenticity and becomes little more than a night out for those who wish to live in the past."
3,Good but John sounds like he's in a hurry to go home,"The songs were sped up a bit as if John was looking at his watch and thinking ""ok let's get through this as fast as possible"".Great musicians but I've heard better versions. The selection is well chosen, but I prefer the Premonition Album a bit more, if only for the time taken to play and the song he dedicated to his wife."
2,Not enought to pass the test,I haven't received my test results back but I can say that I was disappointed with the preparation this book provided. I diligently following the study methods outlined in the book giving myself over 12 weeks to work all the problems and prepare for the test. The test was two or three degrees more difficult than this book and the practice exam seemed to indicate.
4,Recommended,"I used the sixth edition of this book to study for the PE exam. It was my main study guide, and I was pleased with the scope of the material in the book. At least with the topics I did attempt on the exam (traffic/survey, hydrology, open channels), most if not all the material was covered in the book. Using this book as a resource will help you pass the exam. You will definitely also need to purchase the solutions book as well."
3,Wait for the next update,"Out of all the study guides, this one is the best. The first time I took the test this manual was very accurate, but now that the exam has been changed to the breadth-and-depth exam this manual falls way short. The new exam is nothing like the old one, there are no more ten part questions, no more essay problems with four page solutions, and no more problems that the devil himself created. If you are taking this test for the first time it will be your last time. I can honestly say it is ten times easier then what it use to be. And for all you losers that are in States that allow you to bring in this manual to the test, it won't hand you a PE license on a silver platter anymore. Michael Lindeburg, you've got your work cut out for you."
3,Horray!!!!!!!!!!,This is the first book by Joanna Campbell in a long time. I think it's okay to use Cassidy as the main character but I really want Her to bring back the old characters. One good side is that this one is not about Christina. Personally I think christina needs to go find a cliff and jump off it.
2,disappionting,"I was disappionted with this book, especially after reading the other readers reviews. I had thought up until this book the stories had improved. Also could they re-enstated the person who did the covers.The last two have been awful."
1,Awlful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I hated this book It was absalutely horrable!!! If it was up to me I would give this book a negative one billion stars Nothing like the fine work of Camp Saddlebrook!!In this book I fell asleep six times. After the 6th chapter I threw the book agenst the wall!!!! My advice is stick with eventing!!!!!!!!!!
3,It was alright,the book was ok and i'm glad that the books have somewhat come back to racing. i like Cassidy because she is not a stuck-up brat like Christina. she really cared for the colt Pizazz. i think they should have more of the TB books evolve around racing more than eventing. and one more thing. i think that Joanna campell should come back and write the books again. she was a very good author. but all in all a fair book
3,o.k.,"I would just like to say that the old characters should come back. There is no racing anymore in these books and I have lost the meaning of reading them. They never say why Sammy moved, why Cindy left, and what happened to the Townsends? I am no saying that these authors aren't good, but I miss the old horses what happened to them??"
2,Hummmm....,"Yes, I must admit, this book was a teenie-weenie improvement from the others. But still I would like Joanna back...totally. And also the whole consept of the book, made NO sense whatsoever. I mean Cassidy's family is going through really hard finacial times, but she ownes two horses (Rebound and Welly) and her father owns a racehorse (Lady T)...I mean come on!"
5,Havn't read it yet,"Although I havn't read #32 yet. but I heard that it's not about Christina, then that must be very boring. I'm so glad it's not about that stuck up Cindy and Glory again, boy, that was soooooo boring. Who is the boy on the cover? Is it Dylan? Anyways, I don't really think Joanna Campbell is a really good writer."
4,Well....,"OK, it's a little better, you can kinda tell Joanna helped with this one, since there's racing again in this one...more than jumping.But still, who IS that guy on the cover? I'm mystified."
3,Racing?,"I think that this book was OK but even though they tried to make it about racing, it wasn't. First of all, people don't just happen to own champion racehorses. Christina, Dylan, Melanie, etc would know that Cassidy owned Lady T. Also, suddenly everyone loves racing. I mean, Christina hates racing! And I think that they should not have changed the series. Even if they do change it back to racing, it would be fake. NONE of the ""next generation"" riders are devoted to racing like Ashleigh, Samantha, and Cindy. I think that they should just make some mini series out of #24-33 and start over with 24 and Cindy."
5,Can Cassidy help Pizzazz?,"Cassidy has finally told her friends the reason why her family moved to Kentucky. Now her father's only racehorse, Lady T, is going up against the fastest colt around, Pizzazz. But when Cassidy learns that Pizzazz's owners are planning to run him on an injured leg, she knows the race must be canceled. Will her father listen to reason, or will he only care that if Lady T loses the race, he'll have to give her up . . . for good?"
3,not for the beginners,"I bought this book because it was in the medical school bookshop, and I was looking for something about literature review. However, this book is written for people in the social sciences. It has a limited value for someone in clinical research.There are however some good things, it opens the mind to a different aspect in writing reviews. I am sure I have gained some knowledge from it but it was time consuming. It is well written and has examples.It will not tremendously help people in clinical research."
2,Buddhism-lite,"First and foremost, you have to be open to Buddhism in order to feel comfortable with the teachings and meditation techniques presented here. I was introduced to this book by a friend and mistakenly thought this book as a self-help sort of reading material without much religious bent. I was wrong. It is definitely Buddhism, but not in-depth Buddhism either. Just some bits of advice here and there in the form of short slogans and some typical Eastern religous philosophical psychology mixed in to make it palatable for someone wanting mere self-improvement rather than the classic state of enlightenment sought in traditional Buddhism. The title aptly implies starter fare Buddhism. Starting where I am, that I don't like Buddhism, this book is not for me or anyone adverse to religion repackaged as self-help psychology."
2,Not pleased,"I found ""The Buddha In Your Mirror"" to be a much better book on effective Buddhist practice."
5,Start Where You Are,"The book arrived promptly in excellent shape. If you're looking for a primer on buddhism, this is a good place to start. Gets you to practicing the ideas even as you're reading the book.....challenges you to keep an open mind with things you don't quite understand at the beginning...and to lighten up about it. If you're not willing to read it slowly and reflect, its not for you."
4,If you like to learn something new read this one!,"If you like to learn something new, that will stay with you for a life time, then give this book a try. I have read two other books by the same author, but the level of understanding for this particular book was deep and totally worth it. Little chunks at a time, giving yourself time to digest the material served me well as I grew with this book. The ironic part is I started it to help a friend, and wound up helping both of us through difficult moments!"
5,Start Where You Are by Pema Chodron,"This book takes a lay person through a wonderful journey of ones self. It enlightens one to unlock your own compassion that is trapped beneath this wonderfully crazy exterior we show everyone. This book will teach you how to live NOW. It will teach you how to separate yourself from anger. The book instructs you on a few basic types of meditation and how to change the way you react to everything. Most of all, it awakens a part of you that you may have never have known. This is my favorite book. I highly recommend it to everyone regardless of your religious views, the teachings in this book are valid for all of us as humans."
3,"""Experience the blessing"" has testimonies of many people","I am responding to skepticism of others on this book's subject.""Experience the blessing"" has testimonies of many people who have EXPERIENCED THE REAL BLESSING at TACF (John Arnott's Church)...read it and you will understand that these testimonies are real and this ""Catch the fire"" book was written based on real things.I am especially impressed with ""THERE IS ALWAYS ENOUGH"" by Roland & Heidi Baker, missionaries who feed & help the hunger in Africa. They experienced the MIRACLE of feeding lots of children with small amount of food (like Jesus's miracle feeding thousands people with only a few bread & fish)"
1,Heresy of the first order!,"Without a shadow of a doubt this book describes the greatest heresy the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ has ever had to endure in modern times. It uses ""crutches"" of people like Jonathan Edwards and Charles Finney as supports for this so-called outpouring of the Holy Spirit which cannot be used as historical support without a huge stretch of the imagination and credibility. It really has brought shame on the modern Church in the name of Christianity. Read it as a historical document but you won't find very much holiness in it! It should have been named ""Catch a Spiritual Cold""."
2,Cover better than the book,"The problem with this novel is one of characterization. Carmilla is not particularly interesting, and comes off as a run-of-the-mill movie vampire out on conquest. She is somewhat juvenile and one-dimensional. The protagonist is even worse, amost like a castmember of ""friends.""Horror novels need to be scary. They need moments of dread, tension, and angst. Carmilla: The Return simply fails to create a spooky atmosphere, and instead degenerates into late-night soft-porn. Even the sex is poorly handled.Please read the original Carmilla by LeFanu -an infinitely better book."
3,Disappointing,"I did not find this book to be as good as the reviews made it sound. I was sorely disappointed, and after finishing it felt as if I had wasted my time."
1,No instructional content on this DVD.,There is no instructional content at all on this DVD. It gives a diagram of where the lighting is placed then moves right into the photo shoot where the model is strinking poses at 100 miles per hour with the camera firing as quick as a machine gun. Then a couple of the resulting images are shown and then the process repeats. No narraration.... nothing.I think this DVD is good if you're looking for extremely softcore porn but nothing more.
2,Okay But Could Be Better,"I bought this particular oil can because it had a bit of style to it. Unfortunately, that style is now what I dislike about it. The handle is way too narrow and round to grasp well, and the handle is unattached at the bottom. When you tilt the can to pour the oil, the center of gravity shifts, and the can easily slips right out of your grip. The can is stylish and of very good quality materials. I would recommend, however, that you choose a different style from the same manufacturer."
5,Classic tales and lessons that are still applicable today,"Bobby Baldwin was a big-bet winner and was respected and feared by everyone we played, including all the ""legends"" like Doyle. The average or new fan to poker should note that this book went out of print for a long time and was very hard to get a hold of! There are no magic bullet secrets in this book (as it may imply) but the lessons taught about poker and life apply in Baldwin's time as it does now.This is a fascinating account of former world poker champion Bobby Baldwin's meteoric rise to the championship. Covers everything from his early days playing poker in dangerous roadhouses to his high-stakes poker games against other poker legends."
1,The Cooker??,"Great music, but where are those proof readers!?!? The booklet is a mix between Royal Flush notes and The Cooker (lee morgan) notes. I was really looking foward to reading ""A New Look at Royal Flush."" I hope Blue Note does something about this!!!"
4,"Love Life, for Every Married Couple","This is a good and easy read for all christians. It would be good for people not married yet, newlyweds, and married people. Love Life talks about the bible's guidelines for our relationships. The book has many useful ideas. I just disagree with the author's stand on divorce. I believe that divorce has it's place and time."
1,"Love Life for Christian Married Couples, Apparently","This is a religious book. Fundamentally, to its core, this book is based on the Christian religion. This is craftily concealed from the prospective reader in the title and the text on the cover and front matter. As someone who is not Christian, this book holds ZERO value for me. I can get marriage advice from qualified professionals who don't rely on the myths of bronze age tribesmen to formulate their methods. And my wife and I will be better for it."
5,An answer to prayer!,"My husband and I were at a critical stage of healing in our marriage when I read this book. It had been seven months since I had found out about his infidelity. Although I had forgiven him as much as I knew how, there were still a lot of issues we were struggling with. This book has been absolutely the best counsel I have received from any source, short of the Bible. Dr. Wheat's Biblical resources and practical advice combined to help me see the areas I needed to work on to completely release my marriage to God. Much of what he says is opposite of the advice we get from well-meaning friends and family, but it is God-directed and thus the best solution possible. Some of it sounds impossible, but it confirmed to me that God is sovereign and He truly is the God of Romans 8:28. This book has been a life saver to me... Thank you, Dr. Wheat!"
3,Pretty Good Info,Pretty good information in the book. It is very helpful and beneficial to refer back to from time to time.
5,Save your marriage!,"Next to the bible regarding marriage, this is the book to read. Dr. Wheat gives true life examples of people in their marriages, the problems they encounter, their feelings, their struggles, their answers, his answers and the scripture he uses to back up his answers. I recommend this book to all of my friends that are married and continue to use it as a reference guide in my own marriage. It has helped me when I thought that I knew the answer and didn't need any help. If you are married you need the bible and you need this book. Don't be too proud. Buy the book and save your marriage. You say you don't have problems, then use it as a guide to avoid them. Excellent book!"
1,"Insufficient, it reeks of ozone even though it reduces it. They sent me a totally different product, then corrected the mistake.","They first sent the wrong model, then nicely enough they corrected this free of charge. The problem is that even though it reduces the amount of ozone produced, it is too small and insufficient so there is still too much ozone left."
3,Pyle Marine Speakers,Thought Pyle Quality would be a little better.(Kinda tinny sounding) But for the price this set is OK. Good starters
3,Not bad for the price.,"Not bad for the price. Installed in our hot tub. The screws rusted within hours. They are also a little tinny. On the other hand, at low volume, on a quite night, they get the job done."
1,"Speakers,you get what you pay for.",Do not buy these if you looking to upgrade your speakers.These are best used for talk radio and baseball games.
5,CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE!,"Before I purchase a product I do extensive research on it, maybe about 8-9 hours of searching and comparing products on different websites. I compare the potential increase in horsepower, price, and style. I saw a bunch of electric based, but many of the reviews showed that after a few months of usage they'd break down and shortly after so would the performance. I know K&N makes awesome products, but this time they did an outstanding job. I'm 100% positive it works, because every time I press on the gas you can hear a sucking sound from the K&N filter, it sounds like when you have a vacuum on and you place you hand over it slightly letting some air in, I'm assuming that's exactly what it's doing to my engine by letting an so much air in. Oh, and on a last note, my truck HAULS A** NOW. (note: I also installed MBRP exhaust and an airaid to the throttle body)"
3,Lots of Power but Throwing Codes,Ive Installed the intake and followed the instructions to the letterhours after install i threw the P0171 codeit is a run lean codeand i have been told to check for vacuum leaks but there are no leaksi love the power but hate the codes
4,"Very nice poses, annoying to assemble...","Assault troops are always a solid investment into a space marine army. They offer some unique sets of bits (particularly the ""running"" legs and a good assortment of weaponry and acessories that are not normally found in the Tactical Squad boxes.You get 5 models in the box with enough extra acessories to really customize their loadouts. However, as far as infantry models go, these guys are a bit of a pain to assemble and equip.My first issue with them is that the running ""legs"" have a very small contact point with the base, I've generally had to pin the feet to the base in order to ensure a secure contact, as they've frequently snapped off the base while in transport.2ndly, when trying to clean off all of the mold lines for these models, they are especially difficult to get rid of on the jetpacks. Small issue I know, but it significantly slows down the assembly to be of note.Other than that, solid kit overall, though more figures per box would be nice."
5,Ave Imperator!,Great set of five models to quickly get across the battlefield and take the fight straight into the heart of the enemy. Also plenty of left over pieces to kitbash other units and heroes.
2,This is not Lorca!,"I have read many different books of Lorca's poetry, and I think the translation for this book is really poor. It is not keeping with Lorca's real poetry. Try his collected poems or A Season in Granada. Those truly keep with the beauty of his writing. Skip this book!"
2,Didnt work at the archery range with cross bow bolts,"I really wanted a better gripper at the range but with the reduced length of bolts, 20"" vs 24"" for standard arrows, I'm guessing the reduced length (and grip area) will not give me the pulling power I was hoping for."
3,Use on Modern Arrows Only ...,"Well made and a nice fit, but it is really designed to work with only smaller diameter metal or carbon arrow shafts. Not for wood."
1,Works in theory,My 175# cross bow put my bolts in the compressed plastic target so hard that nothing worked. It does not work on carbon bolts.
4,Arrow puller works good,I bought this arrow puller because I shoot a crossbow and the bolts tend to go very deep into the targets. The grip is excellent and it ensures that I will not slip and strip the fletchings off the bolts when pulling them out of my targets.
4,nice tool,"I think this is a very nice tool for archery hunter,makes pulling arrows easy.I bought this tool at Amazon and got great price"
3,needs more meat,"This unit works OK, but it should have a little more ""meat to it""... meaning it is not hefty enough for folks with big hands... it feels like they sent me the kids version.It does help when yanking arrows out of my targets, but it'd be better if it had about 40-50% more rubber to it so it would be easier to grip and squeeze."
5,Great product.,I Shoot on a archery range that uses stacked up carpet as tarkets. There were numerous time I struggled to remove my arrows till I got this puller. So far there is no job that this puller couldn't handle. Workes well pulling arrows out of my Block broadhead target also.
4,Works...,"A bit better than pulling by hand, especially crossbow bolts (or arrows if you're into that). Worth what I paid for it."
2,Kind of thick but good quality,"I was going to give this 3 stars, but it is almost too thick and rugged to use for pulling out arrows. Comes with a clip so you can attach it to your quiver. It might work better for thick wood arrows than my thin composite arrows. I almost do better with my bare hands."
1,ordered this December 30,ordered this December 30 here it is January 10th still have not received it. WOW good thing it is not that important to me.. If you want this look for a different company to by from
3,Makes it possible to remove arrows,As with any thing strenght related. Some can use this some may not. Remvoing arrows from crossbow target made me reluctant to target shoot but this device has improved my attitude a little. It's still hard but no possible with out damaging the arrow. My sone still don't have the strenght but will soon.
2,DOES NOT WORK!,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO PULL MY BOLTS FROM MY CROSS BOW OUT OF MY NEW ""THE BLOCK"" TARGET BUT WAS UNABLE TO. THE RUBBER GRIPPER JUST SLIPS AND SLIPS. FOLKS IT JUST DID NOT WORK ON MY TARGET BUT MIGHT ON SOFTER MATERIAL TARGETS.SORRY!"
4,Not field tested,Seems that this is going to do the trick... Although I have not field tested this I can tell it is a good product. For the $6 I would buy this any day.
5,Very useful.,Have used this occasionally on the tough arrows. Grip size is fine once the arrow is snug in there. It may seem small if you haven't clamped it on yet.
3,not what I was thinking,I reviewed this product to purchase for my 5 lb maltepoo. It is huge and bulky. It collapses on her and the metal connections from the straps to the bag look cheap. The straps are also very cheap looking. It is not a crisp black and white pattern. I am back on the search for another bag and will be passing this on a neighbor with a 10 lb poodle.
4,Good speaker for a very good price,"Speakers have very good sound quality and good frequency response. I actually own a Bose Lifestyle 12 ystem bought in 97/98 with 5 satelite speakers and 1 subwoofer. These Sony speaker, at a fraction of the cost, sound better. In the beginning, I was a little reluctant to buy these Sony speakers, because the price was much lower than similar products by Bose. The only two problems are:1. The supplied wires appear too cheap. I bought the speaker wires from Monster Cable to replace it.2. The subwoofer has some ""blank"" noise after power up but you won't hear it unless you get close. And the noise ""appear"" to be off after you feed the speaker with music."
4,its ok but not as romantic,"its ok but not as romantic as the notion, but its not the best written or organized books but the SM is important"
4,Outstanding,"Simple, dated, but great ideas. The book has a good section on energy conservation of existing structures. I liked how simply the author writes about things. It is dated."
1,This book sucks.,"I'm no ""nuclear scientist,"" to be sure. Clearly, neither is Carol ""I'll just make crap up"" Stoner.Here are two priceless gems of Stoner's work:""Nuclear power is just about limited to the generation of electricity.""..... from page ix""... although reactors require very little fuel, reserves of uranium are expected to last only until a few years into the 21st century.""..... also from page ixIf you buy this book, shelve it next to your books on classic mythology."
1,Family Pictures,"I thought that this book was particularly terrible. It detailed acts of sexual abuse, and featured each character in an odd and foreboding glare. The author did an awful job of trying to create a thoughful perspective on the family, and came out making every good scene into a bad one. In short, Family Pictures was disturbing and poorly written, and the raunchy content forced me to throw the book out only halfway through. What a waste of my time and money!"
1,One of the worst books I've ever read.,"I read a lot of books, though this is the first one of Miller's I've read. Even if a book isn't that great I read them to the end. Several times I almost quit reading this one, but kept on with it hoping to find some point to it. It didn't have to have a happy ending, or even a resolution, but when I finished reading it I felt like I'd been dragged through muck. It wasn't just unpleasant and depressing, it was also dreary and pointless. I wish I could get back the time I spent on it, even more I wish I'd never read it."
5,One of My All-time Favorites,"This is a great American novel, and one of my lifetime favorites. It is the story of how one family was forever changed because of a handicapped child, and how the entire family had to revolve around the needs of this child and his mother's selfless devotion to him, even at the expense of her marriage. She simply couldn't stop giving more of herself to him than to anyone else. This is a truly splendid book, and anyone who thinks there is trashy material in it is nuts."
2,Tedious,"""Family Pictures"" started off promising, but went downhill quickly. Too many words, but no action. Too many scenes in the book that had nothing to do with anything. Many times I was ready to put this book down and not finish it. What kept me reading was I wanted to know what happens to the Randall. I scanned the second half of the book.Not one of Sue Miller's better books."
2,Didn't even finish it!!!!,"I absolutely loved the book ""While I was Gone"" yet I had a hard time getting into this book. I think I had a hard time relating to the story. I pesonally felt that it didn't flow as well as the other book I mentioned before. It seemed a little drawn out at times. I always finish a book that is able to keep my interest, but this just didn't cut it."
4,Portrait of a Family,"Sue Miller does such a wonderful job with characters. There was nothing in this novel that could have stood by itself. It was all in the characters. Miller tells the story of a large Chicago family from the late 1940's to the 1980's. Although this book is described as a family whose lives focus around the autistic son, I felt as though it was more about everyone else. Miller lets us into the lives of all of the family, from the parents to the children. It seems to linger more on those who are deeply effected by the happenings within the family, and leaving some as intimate outsiders.Although there isn't a huge plot, just the going's on of a family, I flew through this book."
3,"Good, but not as good as previous works","I finished the book, but it was work. This novel was not nearly as good as her previous books, but it dealt realistically with the issues of a large family that includes an autistic son. The author jumped around from first to third person frequently, and I was confused about the storyteller. The novel begins with the perspective of one of the daughters, and then moves to the perspective of the mother, and then shifts throughout the book without the benefit of good segues. The character of the father was one that I found quite puzzling, and could never relate to. Why was he so disdainful of his younger children, and why the movement from rejection to acceptance to rejection of the autistic son? His relationship with his wife was odd, at best, and his character did not add to the storyline. The book was interesting, and worth reading due to the obvious talent of the author, but I would recommend the Good Mother before this book."
3,Good but not great...,"This is the first book I've read by Sue Miller. It was interesting and moving at times, but I often found myself asking, ""when is this book going to be over?"". I think Sue Miller writes beautifully but I just couldn't really get into the characters, particularly Nina. I felt as though the book jumped around so much (many different years) that it was confusing at times to figure out how old everyone was in a given chapter, and what had already happened to them. I believe this book could have been shortened (cut out many of the parts about Mack and Nina in their teen years). This book dragged a bit.All in all, it was a decent book, but I certainly wouldn't rate it as great."
4,very real,This book tells the story more of the family with the autistic child than the autistic child himself. I thought it was wonderful and it really made me feel the impact of having an autistic child in the imediate family.
3,"Consider the Max weight, its a problem","The item is GREAT! Its cute has good grips and the 4 year old pettite girl i bought it for was so excited to receive it. BUT the problem was her 6 year old sister, not able to ride it because of the lowww 45 max lbs limit!! The dora scooter was good to 150 lbs!! the next level up RAZOR is good to 143!!!! I got confused too by all the titles! the razor kick a is great! 5 dollars more. but i didnt notice the subtle difference in wording. I almost felt scammed. but, read carefully, there is the kiddie kick, the kick a, the 2006 version kick etc etc if you buy the kiddie for a 4 year old its only good for a few months before busting the weight limit of 45 lbs. it says its good for a long time, yeah if ya pass it along to other kids!"
3,fun while it lasted,"My son loved the blue version of this toy. He was never really steady on the regular razors, so this one game him the confidence to even try it. Unfortunatly, while on a long family walk, he got tired of riding his razor, so Dad tried to ride it home. The plastic frame got bent, and it was never usable again. Just keep in mind, that when plastic parts break, it's over. Wish there was a metal version of this toy. :)"
3,Stable,"My 4 year old was not as excited as I thought she would be with this. It is a scooter you just have to push with one foot and keep one foot on the scooter itself at all times. You can not ""glide"" well on it with 2 feet. The bottom is made of plastic but it seems to be very stable. It was very easy to assemble too!"
3,Pretty Good,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter, and bought a regular razor for her older brother. I think it is great to have the 3 wheels since she is at the age where balancing on it was a little tough, but for some reason it doesn't roll smoothly like a 2-wheel scooter. It seems really slow and I think she gets frustrated with that. It makes it a little more work to push yourself along. I would say, wait till your child is old enough to ride a 2 wheel scooter and skip the Kiddie Kick. The 2-wheel razor works great."
3,"Sturdy, but movement is poor",I bought this for my 3 1/2-year-old son who is not quite old enough/coordinated enough to use his brother's Razor A3. The scooter does not have enough glide to allow him to push off and then ride with both feet on the footboard; it won't go more than a few inches without constant pushing. This is frustrating for him when he sees his brother gliding up/down driveways and around corners. I think this could have been designed to allow for some glide while maintaining the sturdiness for younger kids.
4,Perfect for the first time rider!,My son LOVES his scooter. My only complaint is that the handle bar does not have adjustable heights.
4,Pretty in Pink!,Santa brought my daughters Pink scooters and they love them! They are easy to adjust for height and I like that they come with an extra wheel. Pretty easy assembly after you discover where the wrenches are!
5,Just Great!!!,"My daughter received this gift for Christmas, and really enjoys riding around on it with the bigger kids. She has no problem keeping her balance, and loves to ride. I recommend this to anyone."
4,The last review is about a different book!,"I'll be honest. I haven't used Let's Go Paris 2000. But I just want to point out that the 1-star review given here is actually for the Let's Go Paris Map Guide, a year-old 30-page pamphlet, not the 200-page just-updated Let's Go Paris. So ignore that review and make up your own mind"
4,Important text on turbulence,"This is very good book for understanding the mathematical aspects of turbulence. The book is clearly written and is dense with information. Contents include equations of motion, random flow and its spectra, the Kolmogorov theory, equilibrium flow in spectral variables and in two space dimensions, vortex stretching, polymers, percolation, and renormalization, and vortex equilibria in three-dimensional space."
2,Not what I thought,"I thought this was interviewing of celebs, didnt't know I was getting music, not bout Wendy but her announcements, not worth buying unless you like hip hop music, this is not for the oldies, for young folk"
2,PLENTY OF BASS,"Pretty good interconnects, definitely better than out-of-the-box cables.Changed to a pair of Ecosse Composer ... Cleaned up the sound considerably, especially the booming bass. If you like big bass - use the AR i/c.The interconnect cables make a BIG difference in your system. It's a good place to spend some extra money. Besides, it's fun and easy to experiment with different brands."
2,Bake not Broil,"I used this as a broiler pan the day I got it. The broiler insert ""twisted"" after a few minutes under the broiler. The bottom pan is nice and heavy-should be good for baking but I didn't get that far."
5,Cute Book,The book is really cute and my baby loves to lift the pages up. Good book for teaching your baby manners.
4,Nothing like a toddler who has manners,"Don't have time to put your darling little one in a dress and pig tails? No problem, there is nothing cuter then a toddler with manners. When my daughter says ""Thank you"" to waiters, or ""Your welcome"" to a thank you, or ""I bupped mama, suse me."" it melts hearts! The most amazing one of all is ""Bess you!"" when she hears a sneeze. I won't fully credit this book for that, but it is wonderful reinforcement. She loves knowing the answers on the other side of the page. If you are into manners, get this book. There is nothing more precious then a polite toddler. (It doesn't mean they will start listening)"
3,Excuse me,"Perfect for my 13 month old who now says ""excuse me"" and ""yes,please"". I am waiting for other phrases to appear! Very American - with 'Mommy' being used. I was scheptical - but my daughter loves it and can manage to lift the flips easily."
2,For Children Who've Already Learned Some Manners.... YUCK!,"I have taught my 18 month old (since he was about 16 months) to say please and thank you. We are working on ""excuse me"" and ""sorry"". Our son happily participates in manners throughout the day. I bought this book to re-enforce what we've been teaching. I think this book bombed for us because of either one or all of these: 1) He already knows manners and felt patronized. 2) He was turned off by the words, ""No, Thank You"", taking to mean- don't say thank you. 3) The pictures of the faces on the children are blown up like balloons- out of proportion. I thought the book was fine, but, he says, ""YUCK!"", everytime he sees the book and he refuses to let me read it to him. I am taking this to mean any number of things. We can only guess, but whatever the reason is, this book just didn't do it for us."
2,"Content is fine, format is not","My daughter is 19 months and has many books with toddler pages that she takes great care of. This book and the flaps have been nothing but a pain. The books content is OK, but I won't buy any more lift the flap books for several months."
3,I destroyed my book.,I received this book for my two year birthday. After reading it twice with mom I destroyed this book. It was too much fun to rip the flaps off. Mom had to throw it away.
1,Wrong item,"The book I recieved was not what I ordered. It's in the same series, so I kept it, but it's not what I ordered, and it took a very long time to arrive. Will not use this company again."
5,Teaches polite responses in a fun way,"A book-loving toddler will delight in lifting the full-page flaps and repeating the polite phrases--some in response to silly requests. I have received more ""No thank yous"" and ""Yes pleases"" since reading this book with my child."
4,Why does she like it?,"My 17 month old loves this book and has memorized all the answers. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it starts with 'Mommy says ""Do you want peas for Breakfast?"" You say ""No, Thank you!"" - I don't like this pg as I don't want her to learn to say 'No' to food (eventhough it's peas for bf) and currently her association of the word Thank you is when she recieves something ( I guess an older child will be able to distinguish). Besides, that page the rest is great."
5,My daughter loves this book,"My daughter loves this book. Shes 2 and we read it so much the first day she had manners by dinner...seriously. Ever since, she has used her manners just like described in the book. I actually bought it because it was a Karen Katz book and I love them, but the fact that she started using manners was a bonus."
4,baby doesn't like this author as much as I do,"I really like Karen Katz. I think her books are cute and sweet. This one is no exception. The only problem is, my baby isn't really all that interested in them! He's still young, so they don't hold his attention. He usually loves when I read to him, though... so it's strange! Oh well, I will try again when he's older maybe :)"
3,Unfortunately not Good,"This is a book in the adorable Karen Katz- style, but I have to agree with other reviewers who admonished that this book is legitimizing bad behavior. It has the children say ""no, thank you"" to healthy food and ""yes, please"" to unhealthy sweets. Though I see, that on part of the author it may be difficult to decide whether to go with the unfortunate reality of things or state an example and advocate the right thing to do - apparently I would have preferred the author to have chosen the latter."
3,For older toddlers,"My toddler has recently started belching out loud and giggling, so I thought it would be good to start reading this to her. Unfortunately, she has very little interest in the book. It also seems to make several references to siblings like breaking your sisters toy, and I have an only child. This one is getting shelved for a couple more years."
3,Appropriate for under 2 yrs old,This is a very simple book and seems good for maybe an 18 month old. My 2 yr old couldn't care less about this book.
5,coleman,Water jugs in this size are hard to find with good quality. This is a well made jug although the dispense button is a little stiff to push. It shouldn't leak though. Wish it was made in the States also. Would purchase it again.
2,Liner not stainless steel,"I was very disappointed that the liner was not stainless steel. It arrived with the handel popped off, but as I have a machinist in the house we were able to fix it instead of having to pay postage to return. If I had saw the liner was not stainless steel before he fixed it I would have returned it."
4,Great water jug,"The Coleman jug is very easy to fill, easy to use, easy to clean, and keeps water cold for a long time. As an example, chilled water placed in the jug was still cold 14 hours later. I was also impressed that the jug didn't leak during travel, and there was no condensation on the exterior of the jug. I would have given this jug 5 stars, but I was disappointed that it has a plastic interior. We will use this jug for a long time."
3,Coleman usually great but this one leaked at spout,Carried this model for over 2 years with no problems until handle became disjointed from container. Bought this new one but the spout leaks for some reason. Not sure if its returnable or replaceable but will contact Coleman.
1,misleading discription,It was advertised as a stainless steel jug but was actually plastic on the inside and not recommended for hot items - bordered on mis-advertising in my opinion - returned it
2,Plastic jub with stainless steel wrap,"This is just an inexpensive plastic jug, with stainless steel casing on the upper portion. The stainless steel is really only aesthetic. In fact, high quality plastic would be more structurally supportive and protective. Valve is difficult to press in for adults, and especially for children. Not really worth the price."
5,Best ghost story ever!,"The very thought that an ""average"" person like Bedie could be haunted by an evil entity made me feel that it could happen to anyone of us at anytime. This tale while set in modern times, brings up the memories of reading ghost stories on rainy afternoons, when any sound could startle you with delightful chills. Jane Hollingsworth knew what she was doing when she wrote this book."
1,"Confusing, muddled, slow.","320 pages, 11 alien species, 4 or 5 main characters, 1 or 2 memorable events. = 1 star."
3,"Alas, not his best.","I really wanted to like this book and did enjoy his vision of elaborately symbiotic aliens, but his story is fruitlessly convoluted. Despite much redundant exposition, it ends up reading like a whodunnit in which you don't really know what the crime was. Some judicious editing could have brought this book to the usual magnificence one expects of Jablokov. Still, it's worth a read."
1,A well-written mess,"DEEPDRIVE, while well-written, suffers from the kitchen-sink syndrome. Just a few pages into the book the reader is exposed to a dozen aliens and a human or two and all sorts of dangerous political situations. Even though I'm a sci-fi fan from way back, this was just too rich for me and I just couldn't get into it."
1,Over the Space Opera Edge,"I generally only dabble in space opera in favor of harder sci-fi, and this one went too far for me. Too disjointed, nebulous plot line for the first half of the book, and the ever-present hard to remember names. I couldn't bring myself to finish it, but will try again some day, at which time, for the sake of the die-hard S.O. fans, I might be able to improve this review. For now, never again."
2,Didn't Fit...,"It's a great product, and it seemed like it was of great quaality, but it didn't fit my steering wheel no matter what I tried. Maybe Suburban's steering wheels are bigger than normal cars, but I was extremely bummed when it didn't fit and I couldn't order another size. Also, the cost to ship it back was way too much to try and return the item. It wasn't worth it."
3,thanks,thanks recieved it in good order every thing was package good and i got it when you said i wood.
1,Doesn't fit all vehicles,"I purchased this cover to go along with my new truck. However it doesn't seem to fit ""most"" cars as after hours of struggling I tried it on my wife's car, no good either. After tying to stretch (which it doesn't) pull, and pry it onto my steering wheel, the lining was torn and ideas left frustrated, so into the garbage can it went. Buyer beware."
2,Disappointed,The Pittsburgh Steeler steering wheel cover did not fit. In my quest to make it fit it just ripped. I tried to fit it on a van steering wheel. Is there a difference between car or van? Would have been nice to know before hand.prettyeyes
1,"stinky, smelly, gross","This reeks, its been sitting in my garage for a year now and it still smells like tar. The smell stays on my hands if I even touch the thing! Buy something else!!! worst.purchase.ever."
3,Steeler emblems comes off fast,I do like the steering wheel cover except for a couple items:1- The smell of the steering wheel cover has lasted for over a month now and the smell comes off on your hands.2- The white Steeler emblem started coming off a week after we put it in the car. It was tacky feeling from the first day and started wearing off shortly after that.
3,smells like tar...,"Looks good when first recieved, but smells like tar. Wait until its trapped on a warm car...not a good smell. The Steelers logo started to wear off after only a few days."
2,steekers poly suede steering wheel cover,Though this product looked great and arrived in a timely matter. It did not fit my truck. We tried everything. I drive an f150 and it just wouldn't fit. I think I am glad it did not now after reading some of the other reviews. If I had read them first I would not have purchased this product. I couldn't have dealt with the smell even if it did fit.
2,Not A TEXTBOOK- NEEDS Texbook or useless,"Be very careful when ordering that you order the textbook, not the workbook. I havent yet seen the textbook, though I thought that was what I was ordering. Workbook is useless without textbook."
3,Picture is not the product,"The picture shown for the product has a CD in the right corner of the book. When you purchase the book, there is no CD that comes with it. Should the picture be changed as to not mislead the customer?"
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your time and money buying this tent. I was at the beach the wind was blowing and all the sand came into the tent, also it rained and the water leaks on the edges......better buy wenzel tents cheaper and better quality."
1,THIS TENT IS NOT BLUE!!!,"Just ordered this tent. This tent is BURNT ORANGE. I guess it is fine for most people, but I hate that color with a passion. They need to keep that color in Austin where it belongs."
3,wrong color,We like to know what we are ordering. in this case the tent was a completely different color than shown and we did not see any place that said we might not get the same color. We were ordering it to go with another tent we already had.
1,Mister Manual Mister,"This item came without directions for assembly, no invoice and no number to call. I had to invent a way to make it fit together, using an extra size of tubing and heating it to make it fit. The action was smooth at first but now catches midway. The mist is good, a real mist. For $25 I expect directions and a number to call.Yvonne Prete"
5,Great Book,I find that the information it contains supports most of what I believe in assessing students in the classroom.
2,easy read,"This book is a fairly easy read. However, so far it has been more about authentic assessment than how to assess English Language Learners. Also, there are some editing mistakes that drive me crazy! This would be a good resource if you wanted to know about using portfolios or other forms of authentic assessment."
4,"Dense, hermetic stories","It took me a time to forget about trying to understand Amichai's book. By which I mean, forgetting myself, my own wishes for what I expected from a story. When that happened I found the prose magical and affecting and the atmosphere of the book beautiful, frightening, poetical."
3,Very basic,"This book has very useful pointers, but not many of them, and it repeats them endlessly. It would have been a good pamphlet."
2,Nothing new...,"If you are new to the business of getting gigs, and know absolutely nothing about business in general, then this book may be helpful. I was looking for something more.To me it seemed that the author's approach was that he was speaking to dead beat musicians who are lazy and complaining all the time. I personally think that there are many talented and hard working musicians out there who hustle each and every day to get gigs and are far beyond needing the advice that you must pick up the phone, treat your band like a business, etc. We already know all of this.I was looking for a book (and still am) that would get into more depth on this subject of getting gigs and give some original ideas. This book had nothing new to offer me.However, if you are brand new to the business, and to the business world in general, you may get something from it."
3,DOUBLE DOSES OF THE BOZ,"In THE OPERATIVE, Brian Bosworth gets to play a double role...one of an ex-CIA operative screwed by the government, and a flashy Texas billionaire. While Brian will probably never see an Oscar on his mantelpiece, the durable action star has learned to at least put life into his characterizations and take the punches he so often gets. Brian is bogged down in this one though by a confusing, inarticulate script and Russian dialogue that tends to hinder the understanding of what's going on. A subplot involving an ambitious FBI agent adds a little color to the proceedings. There's enough action, however, to keep you entertained and by the end of the movie, the plot's maelstrom almost makes sense.A good time waster, if nothing else."
1,Is this book a Blessing...or a Curse?,"When I picked up Bless the Beasts, I have to say I expected a bit more than the book delivered. The plot was all right; rather predictable, but interesting. However, there was little else that was ""all right"" about this book. The writing was flat and to me, seemed as though the author was trying far too hard to write well, and in the end just managed to write badly. If you like a book that you don't have to think about, then this is for you. However, if you actually like a little content in your books, don't read this."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","The book, is not so bad, but some characters are no so good. Tom and Kim are too childish, they don't even think before to act. A new world, and they eat native food, they don't try it, they eat it right away. They go everywhere, even alone. Well, the plot is ok, it is fast, but their character are naives."
2,Filled with inaccuracies and mistakes,"This book is filled with inaccuracies and mistakes. From the pervasive swearing (against what Star Trek is all about), to Janeway's impatience, rudeness, and downright nasty behavior (definitely not ST), this book is very disappointing.Harry Kim doesn't call Tom ""Paris,"" though he does in this book and he acts immature, an insult to Harry Kim fans. What's worse is Janeway is portrayed as a rude, impatient, bully of a captain. There are very corny lines that no character would ever use and most characters act well, completely out of character. I was very disappointed with this book and am glad I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it."
4,Deja Vu:I've read this book before-ST TOS,"Haven't I read this book under another title? It reminds me a little like Howard Weinstein's Deep Domain: Hidden agendas, martial law, power plays, kidnapping of Federation personnel, and sea mammals being used as pawns by humanoids for their own purposes."
5,A fine story,"I have written reviews for other volumes in this truly wonderful series, explaining how superior production values, vibrant voice acting, and evident love for the story, all combine into discs worth owning, let alone viewing. This final volume does not deviate from those earlier reviews. ""Highly recommended"" does not even begin to convey my respect for this story."
1,Don't Buy,Lettering came off during first hand wash...contacted manufacturer and was told a new one would be shipped. Never received it. Stay away from this product.
2,the performance,"I didn't expect to be given this product with the low quality.In musician world, there are lots of performances of pieces and as a professional, we prefer to listen to the best performance cause we respect to our ears.this performance was one of the worst ever in terms of tempo and the balance between orchestra's sound and piano.Generally speaking, the sounding is not rich.Besides, the picture of the cover is totally different from the one in the amazon.com(i don't like it) .I think, it would be better if i could listen to a sample of this performance, provided by amazon.com ."
3,Several cat breeds missing.,Nice photos of the breeds. Not enough pics of the varieties within the breeds they did have.
5,The Best Eddie Palmieri Album,"I have had this album since it first arrived in the music stores. I love this album, by far the best album I have ever owned."
1,No lead singer on tracks.,"Unless you already know the songs, you won't learn them from this CD. There are no tracks that let you sing along with the singer. Lame."
2,Not the real Artist,The Cd is Ok if your not a true Micheal Jackson fan.It's not MJ on the Cd..I prefer to have the Karaoke with the true MJ singing in the back round vocals...
1,I recommend you stay away from this product.,"I purchased this little unit about a year ago and have been using it since. After about a month of use the USB arm split in two. Rather than take it back I just taped it up and kept going. About three or four months layer the actual USB pin buffer inside of the USB connector split into three pieces. Once again I put it back together and made do. Well to culminate things, the internal HD (Seagate) crashed and rendered the drive completely unrecoverable (unless you want to pay a whole lot of money).My recommendation is to stay away from this product do to its weak design. As for the hard drive malfunction, I am not pleased, but the technology is so small that what can you do. I personally won't be buying any products with microdrives in them until I feel that they are more suitable for long term portable use. Memorex is now on my ""Don't Buy"" list, but some of their products are probabally still good."
4,Works for me,People seem to love this stuff or hate it. Put me in the love it category. I have found nothing better for removals of minor scratches. I use it on my truck and on my Porsche. I recommend it.
5,Can't beat it for surface scratches,"I bought a tube of GS27 about 2 years ago, I just ordered some more, it's great for autos with surface scratches, it won't fix dents, as long as it doesn't have missing paint, it works, I also find it works great on other household items, that nothing else will clean it up with."
1,GS27 just doesn't work,"Just bought a tube today in a store. Tried it on a couple of pretty superficial scratches - the kind that don't go all the way through the paint, and are mostly white. Absolutely no change. A useless product. Mark"
1,Useless scratch remover,"I bought this believing that it would remove a very small scratch from my car. What a complete waste of money. I tried using it at least 10 times with various types of cloths, and pressure, nothing worked. The scratch remained exactly the same. I absolutely would never recommend thisproduct."
1,The Truth Behind The Tricks,"Take a very fine art brush and cheap poster paint. Paint a hairline scratch on your car.Now take some ground up instant coffee and sprinkle it on a chrome bumper and mist it with a little water to look like rust.Buff up these areas with GS27. Like magic; the scratch and rust are gone! Yeah, it's gone because there was no damage to begin with; it was all fake.Now you know how that commercial was made so many years ago. Be smart, don't let them take a single penny of your hard earned money."
2,toolbuzz,I purchased this saw about a year ago. I hold a full time position as a site superintendent so I only use my tools when I land side jobs. This saw looked to be a well built tool. I bought it because most of my side work is remodeling. I have around 15-20 hours tops on this tool. Just recently I was in the middle of a job when it just DROPPED DEAD on me. The tool still looks new. I had to finish the job with my 5year old DeWalt 18 volt. New the saw cut great but if I cant depend on a tool; my customer cant depend on me!!! I will think twice before I buy Milwaukee again.
2,do not buy,I bought this tool a year ago. After two weeks it would heat up so hot you could not hold it. Then it lost all power...It has limped along since then.
1,Delayed product and poor quality,The Milwaukee Sawzall appeared to be a factory second. The blade clamp was rotated about thirty degree. This resulted in a delay of over two weeks before I had a usable Sawzall. This was not the first delay I have had from Amazon. It will probably be the last.
1,Junk!,"What a shame! Have always used Milwaukee sawzalls in the past and am currently using a 10 year old awesome super sawzall. Decided to get a new back-up in case mine croaks and couldn't believe how much this thing vibrates and shakes, my old one doesn't vibrate one bit. Save your money and stay away from thing!"
5,Milwaukee Super Sawzall A Rugged Well Built Tool,This saw is a bit on the heavy side but perhaps that is why it is so rugged. It's counterbalancing of the stroke makes it's operation smooth with a minimum of vibration and the powerful motor has what it takes for a heavy cut. I'm glad I bought it.
1,inferior,"We demand real work from our tools on real building sites. We purchased this tool and found frustrations quickly. If you don't hold the shoe adjustment lever closed with your hand it will vibirate loose and release the pivot shoe continously. We were demolishing a roof and it lasted all but four hours and then began ""slipping"" full time. The motor would run but the blade action lost all power. We had it replaced with another and it's cutting action began slipping right out of the case. We were cutting through 3/4"" buffalo board and 3/4"" pine siding, yet it kept slipping. We returned it to. The 20 year old Milwaukee sawzalls came out again and continued the job! I don't know if I will buy anymore Milwaukee tools because this has sure tainted our past success with Milwaukee tools."
2,Can't say that it did anything,"I used these Tricomin products and I really don't see that they did anything for me at all. The shampoo is ok, but so are many other shampoos that cost less. It didn't help with hair loss and didn't slow down hair loss in any way so as far as I am concerned, it didn't work."
4,Great for all ages!,We first saw this book at our local library story hour. It was so cute that i had to buy it for my cousins daughter for her 3rd birthday. She LOVES it! I can't wait to buy my own kids a copy. If your child likes singing and Rock N Roll they will like this book. Also if you kids like animals they will love this book. It was just too perfect for my cousin who used to have a band in his younger years and is now very much enjoying being a daddy. Now he can sing his daughter old McDonald in a totally new way! Very fun!
3,Not bad.,"Jarrett J. Krosoczka, Punk Farm (Knopf, 2005)Amusing kids' book, if far slighter than most of those I've seen in the past few years. Basically a lot of setup for a rocked-out rendition of ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm"" (much more amusing at the book's website, [....], than it is in print). In my estimation, the younger the child, the better, on this one, and it'll require a reader who's good at acting out sounds. (Check out the recorded song for an idea of what the sound effects should sound like; the words don't really give you much to go on.) Fun stuff, but your kid may grow out of it faster than other books. ***"
4,Agree with other two reviewers,"We have owned this shop vac for many years. I have liked it very much. I may try another that has gotten 6 Five star reviews. Hope I like it as much as its other reviewers do.This shop vac did the job. Cobwebs were not as easy I would have expected, detaching the blower is a two hand job vs. the one handed job the other vac's reviewers rave about.It's a good vac and has lasted us probably 10 years. Motor has finally burnt out, probably abuse on our part. It is a LOUD vac, even the blower is very loud. I never questioned it. It's a shop vac, I expected it."
5,Timeless wisdom,"Money, people, and negotiations don't reallly change over time. This progam brings timeless practical wisdom. Get it."
4,Negotiate a Win-Win,"Negotiating effectively depends upon having some knowledge of Psychology, the Personality of the Buyer, and a Strategy to tie it all together. The easiest way to improve profits is to negotiate better with your suppliers, fostering win-win negotiations. This is easier than improving market share, developing new products or improving efficiency with expensive changes to the business. Dawson has provided rules and gambits for opening a negotiation, tactics to use and watch out for during a negotiation and closing gambits that make it possible for everyone to leave the table feeling like they've won. He has also included hints and tips to make your products and services appear more valuable, and to help you cope with the intimidating or subtle tactics of your opponent. Finally, he has created personality types that help you to identify how your opponent operates and what you can do to negotiate successfully with them."
5,A great addition to your personal library,"This book is truly a must read! It shows you the intricate details of how to negotiate for anything that you may want. It could be your next salary, car or even the allowance amount for your kids. Mr. Dawson takes you step by step through his win-win negotiating style.The book will show you the different negotiating gambits that you can use. For example, Mr. Dawson explains gambits such as ""Ask for More Than You expect to Get"", ""Never Say Yes to the First Offer"" and many more.Just a note on Mr. Dawson's writing sytle. I felt that writing could have been more concise. At times, he uses more words than necessary. However, the writing was extremely clear and it made the book so much easier to read.Overall, this is a great buy. Don't hesitate and pick up a copy."
5,Packed With Knowledge!,"As you read Roger Dawson's now-classic book, you'll find yourself nodding your head saying, ""Those guys used that gambit against me last week."" And then you will say, ""Never again!"" This book is a rarity: A ""Secrets of"" book that actually provides you with useful tactics that you can employ in daily life and business. In fact, the knowledge you gain from this book will come in just as handy in everyday situations, like buying a car or setting your kid's allowance, as it will when your business' survival is at stake. While the secrets themselves can be reduced to common-sense approaches, many are intuitively brilliant, like the advice to psychically flinch when you hear the other side's first offer. We [...] recommend Dawson's insider insights to all readers, because everyone can benefit by negotiating a better deal."
2,"Shallow, chicanery, not win win.","He starts off by talking how you should think win win, however, he could care less. He says you should trick the other person into thinking they won. He brags about how he gets these great deals by taking advantage of people in desperate situations. The book has some decent pointers however, I can hardly get through it by how much this man and his thoughts repulse me."
4,"Secrets of Power Negotiating, 15th, Anniversary Edition: Inside Secrets from a Master Negotiator",My landlord told me to pay my rent before I read this book. Now I tell my landlord to pay my rent.
2,Not a very inspiring read,The books has covered a lot of negotiation tatics; however the suggestion which it offered to neutralized those tatics are not the best ones which I have come across.
1,Haven't received it,I ordered this product on 12/14/08 and as of 12/21/08 I have not received any information regarding its shipment. I have received no updates from the company and am extremely disappointed that I will likely not have it in time for Christmas.
3,Finding a NOKIA mobile phone,Can I find a mobile phone type Nokia 2300. The latter has got a domestic radio feature. Please answer back.
3,Jackie,I bought this product for my Kindergarten class. It's a great learning tool for number sense and number recognition. I just wish it would have been a little thicker. As the students manipulate the links they break easily. I am continually having to replace them each year.
3,Slightly disappointed...,"I've done Brian Kest's yoga tapes for a few years now, and was looking for something different. Rainbeau was reccommended by someone, and while I thought her teaching was good, and the scenery and music were great, I was really disappointed in the simplicity and duration of the routine. None of the challenging poses Rainbeau is seen doing are taught, nor are the easier poses leading up to them. It's really just a basic sun salutation with a few other things. It wasn't nearly as challenging as Kest. While I liked her personality better, it looks like I'll have to stick with him for a challenge and/or an hour-long session."
2,embarrassment for Yale University Press,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that all the other reviews agree with my estimation, which is that this is a superficially researched, ahistoric polemic. There are a few nuggets of interest here, and the overall thesis -- beware of entrepreneurial confidence men -- is not a bad one, even though it is drowned out by modern bureaucracy, applies in all walks of life and applies just as well to Julian Assange as to the Iraq WMD's ""Curveball."" But really, not up to the standards of Yale University Press."
2,Sloppy Research,"I consulted this book to see what this British author had to say about Allan Pinkerton, founder of the Pinkerton Detective Agency and the forerunner of the Secret Service during the U.S. Civil War. The author's brief account of Pinkerton's ""Molly Maguires"" investigation was shockingly inaccurate and misleading. This book is an embarrassment for Yale University Press."
2,Amazingly bad,"As I've mentioned in other books, the secret services history is far from simple. The author manages to make it unnerving to read. Not because of facts presented but because there's no sequence, no effort to write the book adequately. He goes un using exaggerted words, which come out of context with the book.It is as if a highschool student wanted to make a display of his extense vocabulary, grabbed words out of a dictionary and made a great example of not knowing how to use them. The book is also too opinionated. It is leading you to the author's opinion, he leads on a battle without backing, to direct you to think that secret services are over funded, still filled with a seemingly patriotic belief in their good intentions.On the whole, the author set on an ambitious idea of writing a book, tried to fit anectotic facts with hard history and set his opinions, and managed to make a hideous menage. There are better books on the subject, and I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Poorly written, poorly edited","The other customer reviews capture the weaknesses of the book. I would only add that a review laying out these weaknesses at greater length and with more precision was published by Piero Gleijeses in the Journal of Interdisciplinary History, vol. 34, #3. A brief extract:""Cloak and Dollar adds virtually nothing to our previous knowledge of the CIA, and, worse,it is riddled with old chestnuts and misleading statements. It is, almost invariably, shallow.""As he indicates, the problem does not lie with the central theses of the book, which are quite reasonable. But the research is uneven at best, and the presentation surprisingly weak on a number of levels. Gleijeses recommends Evan Thomas' The Very Best Men, which I have not read myself."
1,Poorly written in the passive UK tense,"The British have a perculiar way of writing, that, coupled with the passive tense, makes this book a nuisance to read. Puruse the on-line exerpts provided by Amazon for a preview.Other than that it's a good book, not that I've read it, but from what I've heard."
5,Great quality,This sheet set is great quality. I originally saw it at Dillards for a small fortune and found the exact same set for a fraction of the price here. The colors are bright even after several washes. I can highly recommend it.
4,Very Informative,This was an excellent book which was full of previously unknown information. I was particularly surprised to find information pertaining to genetics and skin color. There is so much that most people probably never knew about this culture that is revealed.
3,A bit text bookish,"Very, very interesting, but reads a bit more like a text book than I would have liked. But, I did like it all in all and would recommend it to anyone seeking information about the history of African-Americans. Some very important information in this book."
3,"Entertaining story, poor editing","This is a story of a modern-day woman who is haunted by a spirit, and time-travels back to 1943 to meet (and fall in love with) the man who is haunting her. The book is slow to start, but speeds up and becomes a generally entertaining read with some very funny patches. Unfortunately, the plentiful editing errors, grammar errors, and bad writing often detract from the story and give the impression that the author slept through high school English. For example, the author inserts commas at random, uses ""must of"" instead of ""must have"" and ""there"" instead of ""they're,"" and loves sounding like Yoda (e.g., ""Impressed she was,"" ""Abandoned he felt,"" ""Angry I am.""). The latter is the most irritating, and I found myself reading just to find the next Yoda-ism (usually within a page or two) rather than to absorb the story."
5,My son loves it!,"My 8 year old had played with this toy in school recess with a friend that had it and loved it. He then got one for his birthday and loves it still. It did get stuck down once and I had to rough it up to unstick it, but that was the only incident of malfunctioning. It does take alot of wear and tear so far. It works well - push it down, push it away and after so many turns of the wheels it causes it to pop up and off the ground, then land."
3,amplifiied photo phone,"The service was prompt and the phone was exactly as pictured. However I purchased this for my elderly grandmother and she has trouble remembering to push the blue button every time she answers the phone in order to make it loud enough for her to hear. We have had some entertaining phone calls with two or three of us having to yell simutaniously ""HIT THE BLUE BUTTON"". Then we all get a good laugh."
2,"Really stupid: ""Amplifier Off By Default""","Like a previous reviewer, I was surprised (disappointed might better describe it) that the amplifier feature turns off after every call. My 83-year-old mother-in-law Alzheimer's is biologically incapable of remembering to push the button on every call, which renders this phone basically useless.I would not buy another Ameriphone unless they fix this serious flaw."
1,Butter Keeper,Really beautiful trinket. Crappy for holding the butter though. It keeps falling into the water. I will end up using it for something else. Do not waste your money.
4,Sting unplugged a different side of him.,STING PLAYING THE DOUBLE BASS! Sting ( aka Gorden Sumner) plays Bass and sings on key in this rare glimpse of the rocker.
5,ATHF 5,"This is a great volume of a ridiculous series. These episodes are by and far the most offensive episodes to date. If you like the other Aqua Teen volumes, you will love this one."
2,Not the Best Volume/Season,"I am a big fan of Aqua Teen Hunger Force but this is by far the worst season of the bunch. There are a few good episodes on this collection, but no classics (compared to some others), and some episodes are pretty stupid. If you are not a hardcore fan, I wouldn't bother with season 5. Seasons 1-4 are still the absolute classic must have seasons."
1,Mortified,"I am a 22 year-old college student who loves ATHF. I own all 4 seasons and love them.That being said:The episode where Frylock gets cancer isn't remotely funny. Bart Oates episode, mildly funny in theory. Handbanana - downright disturbing.Purchase this box set at your own risk.P.S. - Favorite ep. - Hypnogerm"
5,ATHF,Aqua Teen Hunger Force Is The Greatest Show Ever!!! I Own Volumes 1-5 And When You Think The Show Can't Get Any Better It Does So Go Pick Up Volume 5 It Will Not Disappoint!!!
3,"Somewhat weak, but still excellent in places","Maybe I'm not as insecure about dicks as some reviewers, but I loved ""Dickesode"". Rip and win!Overall, though, not quite as funny as previous seasons."
2,disappointing,"I got the impression over the course of season 5 that while they were gearing up for the release of their movie, the creators of ATHF were essentially just ""phoning it in"" ...which is something they did a bit too literally in the ""Boost Mobile"" episode. The jokes fell flat and everything was just annoyingly inconsistent. I'm glad to say the newest episodes have been a marked improvement, and that when Season 6 gets released on DVD, i'll buy that one instead."
3,not the best season,"The DVD's arrived quickly and in great shape. However, season 5 doesn't seem to be one of Aqua Teen Hunger Force's best. Just a personal opinion."
3,a little bummed out.,"i have been a fan of this show for years. there was a long gap between the 4th and 5th vol dvd releases.i was not even aware that a 5th vol had aired on tv, then i see this in the store and buy it on the spot.i was pretty unhappy with most of the episodes. i found more than a few flat out boring and some unwatchable, if i was not a fan. maybe iam just older and i don't ""get it"" anymore, but i just thought they slapped a lot of bad ideas together.this is just my opinion, not the gospel."
2,Not so good,"The product is easy to use, but the most important problem is that the connecter of the pump dose not match the need of the airbed also they were suggested to buy together. Don't buy the pump and the Airbed together."
1,Jan,"It is all plastic, it is not fun to play around it,I do not know how people handle it.I bought this from warehouse deal, and I thought this as a bike pump, but not. It is only for airbed.I am sorry to give a one star, you may try it, I may get a bad one, because it is an open item."
3,Works well with a little work,"The pump is well made and it definitely does the job, but you do need to put in a little work. My arms were shaking a little after using it to fill up a full size air mattress. I really appreciate that I was able to make this work for my Aerobed, since I really didn't want an electric pump or battery operated pump. But I did have to modify it to make it work for the Aerobed valve. I got the hose to fit with a decent seal by using another reviewer's suggestion to use a balloon around the valve and hose.It is annoying to me that there wasn't a hose adaptor that actually fits the valve. Especially since Coleman and Aerobed are part of the SAME COMPANY. Come on Coleman. You can't say that the valves ""fit most air mattresses"" when it doesn't even fit all of your own."
5,Great Pump,"If people want to spend a lot of money for a power pump, more power to them. This works great, and it's not that difficult if you're willing to do a little work. Blowing up our 2 twin Coleman mattresses took a mere 7-8 minutes total. I'd suggest doing this earlier before it's dark for 2 reasons - you'll want to be able to see the valve, and having a 2nd person helps keep the adapter in the valve. 2nd, you'll probably keep your neighbors up if you do this at night - the pump is sort of loud, but not anymore annoying than the electric pumps. I'd recommend this to anyone, for $13, you cant beat it and you dont have to worry about having a plug-in, or a long enough cord to plug it in."
4,Simple efficient and affordable,This pump works well - short size makes you hunch over - can take up to 10 minutes to inflate a queen size mattress.
5,Great Product,"Quickly and easily inflate and deflate air mattresses, floats, beach balls, and any and all other inflatables. Nothing else compares."
4,A Little Short...,"It is a little short, I'm about 5'4"" tall. I'm not sure if you are supposed to hold the pump in your hand or use it on the ground, but it is too small to use standing up on the ground.The pump I received is a little different than the one in the picture.It comes with about 4 different attachments that are tied to the unit itself (so they won't get lost) for use on about any inflatable.This pump can inflate or deflate any inflatable pretty quickly."
4,"Good, Functional Pump With Limits","This is a $7.00 pump I bought to inflate ""small"" items, e. g. Swiss/Stability Ball(s), Pool Floats, Inner Tubes, etc. The pump does a Good job with these and similar items. I WOULD NOT recommend this pump for camping trips, large air mattresses,bicycle tires, etc. It comes with a nice selection of nozzles. It IS ALL PLASTIC and the connecting hose is fairly delicate, lightweight plastic, and would break or rupture easily if not handled carefully. I would not recommend carrying this pump around in the trunk of a car, behind a truck seat, etc. This pump also requires a good bit upper-body STRENGTH; inflating a large airbed or similar item would be fairly difficult for a man/woman of less-than ""average"" physical strength. This seems true for both INFLATE/DEFLATE functions. Again, a good, functional pump for Sports/Fitness Balls,etc."
2,Not an alternative to battery pump.,I bought this thinking it would be better than a battery operated air pump. I was wrong. It is four times the size and it is just as loud or maybe a little louder than a battery pump. It takes about four to six times longer to fill an air matress with this pump compared to the battery pump. The manual pump as far as quality is good. But it certainly could have been designed a lot better. If you are buying this because you don't want to mess with batteries then you might be disappointed. I would buy this if I had to use it daily and have no access what so ever to batteries. Otherwise I prefer an electric pump because of size and noise.
5,good pump,pumps my stuff up quick and with little effort............. i wanted this cuz you never know when youre not gonna have power to use the other pumps that require power... cuz i am smart....
4,Great pump!,"This is a great pump that works on both the up and the down pump stroke, allowing you to pump up your item in half the time. I purchased this for a Coleman 5-in-1 air mattress and it works perfectly. Not as fast as an electric pump, but you never have to worry about it running out of juice (unless you pass out from exhaustion). It does take a while to pump up an air mattress, so I wouldn't recommend it to people who have a heart condition or people who need to inflate a lot of large items at once."
1,"Does not fit Boston Valves, does not always work","I bought this to inflate my Sevylor inflatable canoe, which has two pinch valves and two Boston valves. The Boston valve adaptor on this pump does not fit any other Boston valves, which rendered this almost useless for my needs. It works well for the pinch valves, but is a tremendously sweaty workout. Extremely difficult to use for deflating as well."
3,Air mattress or inflatable toys only,I thought this pump would have adapters to make it useable for tire or sports ball application. It does not. My bad....
3,Works well if you get one without a seam leak,"I purchased one of these pumps locally as I needed it quickly. It was usable but had a leak in the seam of the air hose. I took it back to exchange for a non-defective pump, making sure to test before I left the store. Two more of these pumps also had seam leaks! The last one they had in stock was okay. The hose is thin hard plastic with a seam running lengthwise. I can foresee replacing the hose in the future with something more durable."
5,Excellent,"I have a inflatable that's used for swimming and it was too difficult to use a balloon pump to inflate it. After buying this particular hand pump, my job's turned out to be much easier. This one is well-built and is made of high quality materials. I'm surprised at this low price. Go for it without a second thought."
2,Too Large,I bought this for camping and travel to inflate an air mattress and in the picture it appeared to be of a reasonable size but when I got it I was shocked to see how LARGE it is. A smaller pump would do the job as well and not take up so much room in a suitcase or pack.
4,Worth the money,"The hose is connected to the handle, which makes the product slightly cumbersome to use, and the nozzle that connects to an airbed or similar-sized opening is slightly too small. However, a small piece of electrical tape later, it is the right size to stay put. This is a well-sealed pump that moves a great deal of air - if you can live with the handle and have tape handy, it is an excellent buy."
3,Looks good works okay not great,"ProLooks goodGreat priceSmooth ActionPumps a lot a air on each in and out strokeConHose to Nozzle plastic fittings are of poor quality (Do not fit well so be careful as you may have to force them on and off ... you could break them)Plastic design weak and feels you could break the device with moderate forceCannot be used with one foot and one hand. Side forces make it unstable and on rocky ground you may break the footing armsBottom Line Cheap and will work well if you are careful. Use with care and store with care or plan to replace it.I would gladly pay 50% more if the product was stronger, had better fittings and had some form of case / bag to long term storage / transport"
2,Complete Gym workout!!,It took 80-100 pushes to inflate a queen size bed. This pump is extremely labor intensive. Why deal with the pain when a rechargeable battery operated pump cost only $15 bucks more.
4,Well made pump,"I selected a hand pump so it could be used both at home and when camping with no electricity. The pump works great and the only criticism I would have is that it pumps very slowly, so it takes quite a while to inflate or deflate a bed, but it does the job I wanted it to do. It is also light weight, well made, and inexpensive."
3,can't finish the job,"works okay for camping or a one night stay, but can't seem to get the mattress to a final firm postition...we had to finish it off with a hair dryer!"
4,Surprisingly Good,"This pump is much better than i expected it to be. I thought it was going to be a cheap piece of plastic junk, and, it is all plastic, but it works well anyway. It fills a queen mattress in less than ten minutes. It's not hard to pump. It is very quiet (not like a crazy loud 4D battery Coleman pump i had that took forever and finally died after a year's use) so it won't disturb your campground neighbors if you happen to arrive in camp sort of late (as we inevitably seem to do.) It's fairly large and bulky, not compact at all, but great for car camping. Highly recommended if you are 'roughing it' with an air mattress."
3,"not quite picture perfect, but A-OK","The handle was smaller than what the picture showed.That meant the pump itself was actually much bigger than expected and took up twice as much space in my bag and had to re-pack twice.No real complaint though since after all the other folks started running out of battaries on thier battary operated pumps, this pump was still 4 times faster with only a bit of honest pumping and no disposal of dead battaries."
4,Works great,"Pros. Pumps a lot of air with little effort like advertised, construction is good, and all the different nozzles are great and come in handy for any type of job. Cons; I didn't realize how big it is. Not a con for most people but I needed something a little more mobile for some mild hiking. So if your going to hike an inflatable raft to a lake this is not the right pump. Other than that this works like its supposed to."
3,Get an electrical pump instead,"I use air mattresses for camping. This pump is way too big to fit in backpack! besides, it takes me 150 pumps to fill a coleman queen size mattress.For what it is, is not that bad. I understand it can't be smaller, or it would take longer to inflate a mattress. And it can't be faster, since it already inflates twice with every pump. But you can get an electrical-rechargeable pump (same brand) for less than 25 dollars."
4,Works great,This is a great alternative or backup for your battery pump. Also a great tricep/ab workout while inflating your mattress. Have to be careful not to bend or crimp the tube though.
1,Missing adapter,"This pump doesn't work with Sevylor boats. It is missing the mini dual lock adapter. I was on hold for thirty minutes in order to find this out. Coleman owns Sevylor. The box reads, ""Works with virtually all inflatable devices"", except their own."
3,OK but uneven,really for fans only -- the disco remix of Do You Realize was either meant to be a kind of ironic joke by the band or it was a serious misjudgement. You can take your pick. The other tracks are fun for a couple of listens but this is not a must-have CD
3,an okay little disc,"though this is a must-own for any lips fan, it's really not that great. golden age and knives out are live recordings, and inferior to the originals. can't get you out of my head is good, but you can get that and the remix of do you realize?? on other import singles already. the two new songs are awesome, however. strange design should have been on yoshimi, and fiber optic jesus is great. not what you'd expect. 5 stars for each of the new ones, 3 stars for the cd as a whole."
3,"The Flaming Lips ""Fight Test""","""Fight Test"" 4/5""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" 2/5""The Golden Age"" 4/5""Knives Out"" 3/5""Do You Realize??"" 3/5""The Strange Design Of Conscience"" 3/5""Thank You Jack White..."" 5/5The Flaming Lips are known for their flamboyant live shows, and eclectic variety of genres they touch on any given release. This one is no different, featuring live covers by Kylie Minogue, Radiohead, and Beck. There is also a funny acoustic song at the end about a gift from the White Stripes lead singer.Overall rating: Three and a half stars."
4,Helpful help is on the way...,"This book is a rare opportunity to have the questions you need answered BEFORE becoming a parent. Michelle does a suberb job in doing all the work for a parent-to-be. What could be more helpful? With candid honesty, she explores potential problems and adds resourceful hints all along the way. I wish I had this book sooner!"
5,I agree with Daniel - Joy Division at their rawest and best,"Joy Division was a rock band. That comes through on this album. The sound is raw as is the recording but for me it's the best one, the least compromised one the most rebellious one. Great band never to return. One of those inexplicable ""clicked""."
4,The beginning of an astonishing band...,"'Warsaw' was the moniker for Manchester UK lads who hoped for something more. They achieved that with a band - Joy Division - a band that will be remembered for a good few years. Joy Division was one of the first bands to take punk energy and combine it with electronic pulse - and use silence for perfect effect. Man were they good! Warsaw was the starting punk point, it's easy to see the aggressive passion of Ian Curtis & the set plan for Joy Division. A fine CD...."
2,Principles are fine but bad DVD overall,"The instructors are beyond annoying, as most here are saying. The lead instructor is patronizing, and two out of three have hair hanging over their faces at least 50% of the time, which was very unpleasant to watch (don't they have hair bands or something?). I only watched it once and then returned to the library. I watched previews for other LB workouts, and only one had a pleasant instructor.If you are interested in this type of workout, I suggest you try The Bar Method: Fat Free or Designer Sculpting. I own both and do them at least a couple of times a day."
3,Okay exercise,"I like the exercises but the voice of the instructor gets on me. Maybe it's just me, but she speaks to the camera, (us) as if we are totally juvenile and uneducated. Not sincere."
2,Strange Instructors,"I know a lot of people wrote about the creepy and strange demenor of the lead instructor and I would have to add my voice to that.About the instructor: She was wierd and creepy always staring into the camera and and sqinting her eyes to inflect more intensity at times. Her tone of voice was very condesending and she doesn't explain the excerises very well. She pretty much just says ""we are doing it perfect so just watch us to learn the proper form"". But the problem is, it didn't ever show any good camera angles to see the form.About the workout: Its ok but I think there are better ones. There is not a lot of variety and most of the movements are not anything new or innovative.I don't think I will be using this one much since there are so many others that are better."
1,"Lotte Berk Method - Irritating instructor, too few reps, boring workout","Lotte Berk Method For Beginners - Basic EssentialsThe instructor was so irritating and condescending to the point of distraction. It was very hard to concentrate on the precision movements when I just wanted to rip her head off for constantly saying, ""Can you tuck? Can you lift your leg? Can you do that? Can you?"" The movements themselves were rather easy and required way too few reps, so it wasn't an issue of ""can"" at all.I have no motivation to try any of the other DVD's because of this woman's poor attitude. Even the DVD editors themselves offer a ""workout with music"" option on the DVD so that you can tune out this woman and focus on the moves. However, the workout itself was not challenging at all, so it's just not worth it!"
5,Good for Beginners!,"I purchased this to get back into exercise. I love that it is one that you can actually do as a beginner, and you can feel it working when you use it. It doesn't make you too sore the next day, which I always dread when just starting an excercise program. You do feel the areas you worked out, but not to where you feel like you can't move the next day. It is also easy to follow, as I am not good at following most exercise dvds. Alot of them have you so busy trying to figure out the moves, you can't keep up with the program. Definitely recommend!"
2,Not much of a workout,I couldn't believe it when this workout was done; I hardly felt like I did anything. Not very motivating either - music and video are boring.
1,"Yuck, I didn't like it.","The instructor is very irritating. She does not make it fun and she is militaristic. I tried it once and couldn't stand it for more than a few minutes. Maybe this method is good with a different instructor or for you if you like the tough stuff. She's kind of creepy the way she stares at the camera. I put it away and tried it again later, but it still didn't work for me. It's in my reject pile. You'd be better off with a Karen Voight or the 8 min As Seen On TV Set.Check my other review on Amazon for the best choices in exercise and yoga DVDs. Thanks!"
2,great anecdotal narrative--cannot relate text to maps though,This book has short inspiring narratives. It seems to have no overall focus. The text progresses through the post D-Day timeline. It tells the story from the German SS Panzer Division point of view. The difficulty in relating the text details to the maps is very frustrating to the experienced military reader.
5,Un libro para disfrutar,"Realmente un libro ameno, pero no por ello poco minucioso, muy fácil de leer y muy entretenido. Resultan impresionantes las acciones de la Hitler Jugend sobre todo en Normadía; una auténtica unidad de élite, cuyas andanzas por Francia durante el dia D y posteriores son narradas de forma muy ágil.Para ser un escritor británico, el libro está completamente escrito desde una perspectiva alemana. Buenísmo para conocer acciones de gente como Wunsche, Meyer, Wittman, Witt, Teddy Wisch de forma distendida y sin caer en la pesadez.Muy bien estructurado, aunque se echan en falta algunos mapas más. A veces se pierde con tanto pueblo y villa, pero no son imprescindibles todos los nombres. Muy barato en la edición de bolsillo.Las referencias al libro de Meyer son numerosas, y realmente dan ganas de leer Grenadiers."
2,A mapless shocker,"You cannot write a military history book like this and expect the reader to understand what is going on if you provide a handful of shoddy maps which don't show the starting positions of the forces involved. Reynolds fills page after page with the exact starting locations of the German forces but it's no better than gibberish because without decent maps the reader has no chance of deciphering what on earth is going on. Great subject, poor book"
3,Sleel Inferno,"This is obviously a painstakingly researched book by the retired British general author, who, in the custom of some other English writers, tells you more than you need to know. The book is not an easy read, unless one is very familiar with small towns,villages, rivers and streams in the Normandy countryside. There is also too much detail about various British and Canadian military units such as the ""Nottinghamshire Yeomanry"", ""2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry"" (both of which conjure up images of soldiers with pikes and longbows)""Royal Scots Greys"", ""Green Howards"" and so on. Of more interest would have been greater emphasis on the larger battle picture. For example, I found ""Panzer Commander"" written by Colonel Hans von Luck much more compelling as it detailed the battle picture from the German side."
3,So-so...,"I enjoyed this book, but beware: it is rather dry. There are maps, but they are not useful. There are many typos (an unacceptable number, even). And while the binding is fine and the photo pages are okay, the paper quality is not equal to other books in the WWII LIBRARY series."
4,fun after the smoking,"After you make the salami, this is how to eat it. Great meal ideas, nicely presented"
3,Not Marsh's best,"Routine murder investigation in rural England featuring Ngaio Marsh's signature detective Roderick Alleyn. An heiress is murdered and suspicion immediately falls upon her doctor, who recently became her fiance and received a tidy bequest in a new will. But what of her sullen stepson and the mystery of the Black Alexander?A good if routine murder mystery. I enjoyed Death of a Peer (aka A Surfeit of Lampreys) more."
4,Vivid Characters,"Vivid characters step off the page in Ngaio Marsh's GRAVE MISTAKE. Each fills his role till the last shovel of dirt is poured on his grave. From the premises that a too good character is always suspect it is rather easy to discover the killer, but the fascination arrives by watching how Ms. Marsh brings him to justice.Dedicated hypochondriac Sybil Foster is murdered while a resident in her favorite health spa and her doctor is named the major recipient of the estate unless her daughter follows her instructions to marry into the peerage.Superintendent Roderick Alleyn has a problem on his hands to find a way into the closed society of rural Kent until his wife's talent and fame paves his way.A fine read at any time.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,Was not as described.,"The seller stated that the book was in excellent condition, but the book had writing in it, the cover and back cover were creased and there was a tear on the spine."
3,poor video quality,They tried to put on a good show but who ever filmed them should have used a high quality video camera. They are pretty women though it is difficult to watch more than one time.
2,naked stretching techs,"This one I didn't like so much, even though they were stretching they looked to be too fat for my taste. I like them a bit thinner. The women weren't all that good looking either."
5,Don't cut this book short!,"In this book, Vince Staten gives all men a chance to reminisce about the time they've spent in barbershops. It also allows us women to get a peek inside the manly domain, and let me understand why my husband and son shun those beauty salons in favor of the American barbershop tradition (in 4 part harmony, okay?)"
3,Reservoir of knowledge,"Its a good book, helps you build a reservoir of knowledge for situations where women need to sit up, speak up and ask for more from their workplaces or businesses."
4,Surprising Strategies indeed,"Wow! Ms. Stanny presented some ideas that I never thought of before. The examples are clear and concise, no psychobabble or motivational drivel here. A must for any woman considering a career change, or has a change thrust upon them."
4,Worth the read!,"Great book for all women that want to or have crossed the six-figure line to read. It has alot of inspirational stories of women who had the very same fears, yet got through it.Definitely a book for all women to have in their book arsenal."
5,The Sanctifier,This is an excellent source of Spiritual Enrichment for our souls. Everything that you ever wanted to know about the Holy Spirit and the effect that it has in our souls is contained in this book.
5,Boo Crew,"My grandchild like it, she sat still and watched it all the way through. It was funny, entertaining, and a cast of characters that she recognize from different programs. She loved it, I liked it."
4,Effective Ways to Get Children Writing - Fun too,"If you are a teacher, librarian, home-schooling parent, or simply an adult who wants to learn effective ways to help children enjoy writing, then this book by Marjorie Frank will be fun and useful. In her other book: If You're Trying to Teach Kids How to Wrtie, You've Gotta Have This Book! Marjorie Frank offers both ways to teach and encourage writing as well as the reasons why the methods work. She describes the importance of wanting to write, having something important to write about, then the importance of enabling the student-writer to ""publish"" or ""make public"" their writings. This book helps us get past that scary blank empty page. The exercises make wanting to write - so fun and successful, and important - children don't want to stop."
1,Quantum Physics for Dummies,"This is a case of the movie being a LOT better than the book. The reason is that the tone and the conversational style of the book are so ""cutsey,"" so patronizing, so ... tiresome; it reminds me of one of the Dummies books. The writers ask so many questions: ""So what exactly are emotions? Heard of endorphins? Sound familiar? When was the last time you had an orgasm from a higher level?"" I'm really into the subject matter and I'm 3/4 of the way through the book, but I don't think I can finish it, just because the bad writing (not the quantum physics) makes it so hard to read. I wish the authors had just said what they had to say without studying the Dummies format beforehand. If someone picks up a book about the relationship between spirituality and quantum physics, they have to have had some intelligence and some prior reading in both subjects. These authors don't recognize that. Fritjof Capra it's not."
3,MILDLY DISAPPOINTING,"After having seen and thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the book left me a little cold. The format is difficult to follow on Kindle. The earlier chapters are full of intriguing information, but sadly the last two chapters degenerate into New Age Babble. A pity as I was hoping the scientific connection would be maintained and consolidated."
3,What the Bleep do we know,Interesting reading but not quite sure how much fact is there to back it up. Don't have much else to say about it at this time.
1,Misleading. Realistically this is a self-help book with no scientific connection.,"This book/movie is good in that it at least briefly skimmed principles of quantum mechanics and probably provokes some optimistic thought in its readers. Unfortunately, they dragged the most precisely proven scientific theory out onto the self-help floor. I honestly don't see the connection between Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and learning to better control your life with your mind. Taken word for word these two things might mesh together, but really, this book/movie strips all science from quantum theory, turning it into a two hour message to learn how to think with your mind.This book has no place citing quantum mechanics or anything remotely scientific. It might be useful if you want to stare at the ceiling and try to figure out how to guide your life with what you have behind your eyes. Go read something on philosophy if you want to discover something about thought that isn't purely scientific."
5,Fascinating and Comforting,An insightful read for the non-religious and religious person who seeks to make sense of God and our connectedness to mankind. This book brought me great comfort as I learned about consciousness and what that means in the bigger and deeper picture of life. An easy and fun read with many interesting facts. Everyone needs to see the pictures of Dr. Emoto's water crystals and you will decide to love yourself forever. The video is a great compliment to the book!
5,Mind Expanding Read,I just finished reading the book What the Bleep Do We Know! It is a great follow on to the movie. It has given me a greater understanding of the concepts introduced in the movie. I found the questions at the end of each chapter helpful in thinking about the information presented. I would recommend this book to everyone. I plan to re-read this book it so thick with knowledge and ideas.
4,FILLING IN THE BLANKS,"The movie was excellent, but the book really fleshes out the ideas. If I had a choice, the book would be it."
5,A must have!,"I saw the original film when it opened in Phoenix at the Harkins and ran some incredible eleven months at that theater and have been fascinated to learn more on the scientific principles that are described. I am happy to report that this book does not disappoint. I have been recommending it to everyone because it not only goes further in explaining Superposition, Quantum Entanglement, and Emotional Addictions, but it also gives an ""insiders"" view as to how such concepts affect our everyday reality. It is hard not to be passionate about a book that I think should be read by every high school and college student in the country as well as the rest of us. If people applied these principles, it would inevitably lead to a better world. The book is also beautifully designed. I know what I will be giving for Christmas gifts this year."
3,what the bleep do we know for dummies,some of the better quotes that are helpful and too many movie images that don't enlighten. Seems more like a teaser for the movie.
2,not the best,"I'd been looking forward to this book for months. What a disappointment! For a more balanced look at the themes in the film definitely check out Alexandra Bruce's ""Beyond The Bleep"", which really helps you to get some perspective on the physics and philosophy discussed in the film."
1,"Magic, mysticism and childish metaphysics","I bought this book as the result of a practical joke by a friend. An editorial review states ""Any considering the nature of consciousness, intelligence, reality, or attitude adjustment will find this packed with insights"". As a clinical psychologist I am always looking for insight into the factors involved in how people interpret the world around them. This book does not approach this goal. The stated intent for the book is that if a million people focused on the book then reality would shift for the world. This book is for those interested in magic, mysticism, superstition and childish metaphysics. Yes, I read two thirds of the book. My practical joker has his payback coming."
4,What the Bleep do we know,I've seen it twice and needed to. Would like more scientific explanation in future to validate views
2,bleeping lightweight,"Just as the title says ... excerpts. Nice to have a hard copy I guess, but sheds no new light on the concepts involved. Reader would be better off to get McTaggart's The Field for meatier information. Lightweight."
2,What the bleep do we know?,"Obviously a money making adjunct to the movie,whatever that is.Overpriced,difuse,mysticalwithout fun,quality printing, not worth it, forgettable."
1,A big waste of money,"This movie - if you can call it that - said very little about the subject matter, and simply tried to back up its statements with opinions of others, not facts or studies. If I could return it, I would."
1,AUGHHHHH!!!!!! It hurts!,"If you are a simple thinker, you'll love this movie. It's a movie about how some people would *like* things to be. But really, it's basically an enormous lie. But, hey, some people like this sort of thing.My basic problem with the movie is that is blurs truth and poetry. I like truth (documentaries). I like poetry (drama). But I consider it a sin to intentionally confuse the two.OK, here's the basics. Just because something is true for subatomic particles (e.g., existential superposition), doesn't mean it's true for people. In fact, it's never been demonstrated for people. Ever. In fact, humans have never experienced quantuum mechanics phenomena nor relatavistic pheonoma. Ever. Never. Got it? Even some authors like Ken Wilbur, who once drew a comparison between consciousness and quantuum mechanics, now conclude the similarity is merely coincidental and/or poetic. That being the case, I find it offensive that the Ramtha cult people keep perpetrating the lie."
2,Disappointed,Surprised by the lack of morals in what I thought was supposed to be an inspirational and motivational dvd. Haven't read the book. The dvd was supposed to be taken from the book.
3,"OK, but not great","The case isn't bad but works better for smaller cameras. The HP Photosmart 850 digital camera is a tight fit in the bag. Some descriptions claim there is an AC adapter in the kit, but the AC adapter is a part of the battery charger and NOT for use with an HP camera. The kit seems incomplete with only: 4 AA batteries, charger, and a bag. It seems overpriced if purchased at full list price."
3,Not what I expected 10/19/2003,"The product is fine, however it is not what I expected. The a/c adapter only fits the battery charger, NOT the camera which is the main reason I purchased this kit. Where can I get the power adapter connector."
4,Not what I expected,"The product is fine, however it is not what I expected. The a/c adapter only fits the battery charger, NOT the camera which is the main reason I purchased this kit."
2,Case too small,"Case too small for comfy fit, camera gets turned on by accident. It was free with the camers purch, so worth getting it for the charger & batteries."
4,Psychedelic Lovers Should View This,"This is an ongoing glimpse of Dr. Richard Alpert's transformation as Ram Dass, now going through the experience of 'being stroked' and dealing with the ramifications. There's a good chunk about psychedelics in this, a very brief capture of Dr. Timothy Leary's face, and Ralph Metzner also shows up for a few friendly words.All in all, this is a piece of the puzzle to Ram Dass and his era. I recommend this DVD to a select audience whom have already become acquianted with the book BE HERE NOW, and perhaps GRIST FOR THE MILL. And of course, you should be familiar with yoga and LSD25, otherwise this will probably have little meaning to you."
1,Mickey Lemie slips us a Mickey Finn,"Somebody put something in my drink, or was it this snooze-fest of a film. This guy directs like a dead-beat trying to avoid creditors. What a disgrace to Ram Dass's legacy. Please avoid this film like the plague."
4,Following on the Path,I am one of the original readers of Be Here Now when it came out in 1971. When I found this DVD available it was a good way to see where Ram Dass had been traveling these last 3 decades.It was nice to revisit an old friend and was inspiring. It would be a good video for young ppl on the path to see.
5,OMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmm,"Once again Ram Dass leads the way! He is at his most open, his most giving and humbled in this wonderous film of the journey of his life. old home movies,many stories, comments by friends such as Huston Smith, Ralph Metzner, Larry Brilliant, Krishna Das and Bhagavan Das. This film inspires, as does all of Ram Dass' work.Thank you Ram Dass, Namaste`. i bow to the God within you. Love,*Ladybear~"
4,Exploring Expressive Possibilities,"One of the great joys of music is its endless possibility to surprise. For example, here is a CD that contains music like nothing you may have heard before. Maya Homburger plays the baroque violin, Barry Guy plays the double-bass, and together they make sounds both archaic and futuristic. Ceremony starts with a brief selection by Biber (b. 1644), then moves on to compositions by Barry Guy, who was born in 1947. Whether playing solo or weaving their sounds together, these two players seem in tune both with each other and with the expressive possibilities inherent in their instruments and in these compositions. This is music that really draws the listener in, and the clean recording quality allows for maximal listener involvement."
3,Good for plastic,"As platic-ware goes, these are good soup spoons. Just slightly larger than regular plastic spoons. Would've been nice to have the spoon a little larger so it could be more like SOUP spoons.Ok for a picnic."
5,Good value,"For about 20 clams this bag is fantastic. I have used it a lot and it still looks new. My only complaint is that the snapping buckles that close the flap (which in general is solid design choice IMHO, it's like a backpack strap) have a strap that can be tightened, but if you don't have much stuff in bag, and you tighten it, it often pulls loose anyway. This is because there's not much friction between strap and buckle. If you packed the bag full, I bet it would create more friction."
3,Five stars on quality but 0 or 1 for reliability and cost-effectiveness,"These cartridges (note: real Epson ink cartridges, not knock-offs) produce very high quality images (five stars). The problem is that, with respect to other criteria, they are very much lacking. For example, the cartridges need to be ""cleaned"" (using head cleaning feature in the print window) quite often over the course of their lifespans. Considering that this uses up about 3% of the ink cartridge each time it is done, not very cost-effective (not to mention a pain in terms of time and convenience). In addition, the cartidge indicates ""low ink"" even when you can still get quite a few more prints out of the cartridge. Very misleading. Also insures one cannot be certain when exactly the cartridge is almost out of ink. With respect to these non-quality issues the cartridge deserves a zero or one star ranking."
3,Love Epson products,I really love the quality of epson inks but am disappointed that the ink was about 3 years old. I will pay full price in the future. My fault for looking for cheaper price.
4,Epson ink cartridge,this was a good cartridge while I had the Epson printer. But I have changed printers so don't buy it anymore.
3,Close but misses the mark,"This attempt to re-present the gospels in a feminine friendly format is a noble effort. However, the author changes the meaning or simplifies the complexity that gives the Gospels their enduring power by simple means - for example saying something is ""like"" when part of the textual complexity of the gospel is the ambiguity between reading as a simile or as metaphor or as an actual equating. I also found the picture drawn of males to be more incomplete and more prejudice than the picture of females in the original gospels. I recognize others disagree with me, but I don't enjoy fighting prejudice with prejudice. I applaud the attempt to write a feminist version of the gospel and would not discourage others from reading The Gospel According to Mary I would encourage others to read it with a critical mindset."
2,You REALLY have to be a fan,"I do love me some John Mellencamp. Really I do. And I was initially delighted to learn of this release. And the remastered sound is awesome.But...this is some pretty weak material here. Except for I Need a Lover (which is virtually identical to the version we all know and love), there isn't one song I felt like I wanted to listen to again. You can tell John and his band are TRYING to make a hard rockin' record, but the execution is so sloppy, you wonder if it was worth the effort.Recommended only for hardcore fans. I consider myself one, but I'd much rather have a remastered disc of Chestnut Street."
1,"bad product, bad seller","I thought i was buying from Amazon, which i trust. Instead it went to Go-Vacuum. When I got the item, the seal was open on the box, and the ""turbo brush"" had a couple of hairs in it, so i assumed that it had been used and returned. I returned it, and Go-Vacuum charged me $15 shipping which i thought was unfair, since the item was obviously used.The Turbo brush itself appeared to be a piece of junk, no different from the head that comes with the Bosch vacuum. It weighs about 5 or 6 ounces, and is just a conventional carpet head, and a cheap one at that. I don't recommend Bosch or Go-Vacuum."
3,Retitle Product Listing Please,"The Corsair RAM here is DDR2. PC2-5300 denotes DDR2 @ 667 MHz. CAS Latency 5...actual timing set is 5-5-5-15.The voltage is 1.8 volts.(I got the specs from the Corsair product page)In the title DDR3, is misleading. VS1GB667D2 is a 1 gig stick of the value select Corsair ram, and VS2GBKIT667D2 is 2 of those.Installing on an Asus M/B, along with 1 more. Friend's PC is slow, with 1gb of ram. The AMD CPU is 1.8GHz dual core, so not much I can do...good place to start is have enough ram."
4,priced right and works good,"This RAM is exactly what you pay for... it's not the ""top of the line"" but it is not ""garbage"" either... it is the bargain version of corsair RAM. I used it to upgrade an old PC I bought for $40 on c-list... so far it works great, and I feel like i got a good deal."
4,"Good memory, worked out of the box like a charm","Bought to triple my aging Dell's memory, from 1 GB to 3 GB.Note that this is DDR2 SDRAM not the modern DD3 SDRAM, so it is for older computers.Fit right in perfectly in the slot and the computer recognized it right away when it booted up.Now my Dell is way faster in startup/shutdown/word processing while on the internet.Only gripe I have is the price. Why is DDR2 SDRAM 20-30% more expensive than DDR3 SDRAM. That's why it's 4 stars and not 5."
2,System crash...,"I have an Alienware Area 51 desktop computer which was really sluggish due to the minimal amount of ram that I had installed. I had been looking to beef up my ram for some time and the Corsair 2 GB ValueSelect had a very appealing price tag. Installation was a snap and my system initially booted up and ran. As soon as I attempted to go online, my system crashed, went to the 'blue screen of death' and dumped all memory. I tried repositioning memory modules to no avail. Removing the newly installed memory returned my computer to normal. Amazon was great about the return. I printed off a return label and had no issues returning the memory for a quick refund. I have since added 2 GB of PNY memory with no issues yet. (I still have my original packaging though!) My computer is up and running faster than ever now..."
4,Decent memory,"Once I managed to get the top card seated correctly, it worked like a charm in my Dell XPS 400"
3,Very disappointing,"I'm only half-way through this book, and I'm only continuing because I hate to quit a book once I've started it. I would never have thought I would write a luke-warm review for an Anne McCaffrey book; she's my favorite fantasy author. But this book is so mediocore. I was really happy to see her continue this series, as I enjoyed the original three books. But what happened? I agree with one reviewer that it doesn't even seem like McCaffrey's writing. Since I haven't reached the end of the book, I don't know how it ends. But I hope it ENDS. I don't want to finish this and be left holding on for more."
5,Another winner,"Freedom's Ransom is another winner for author Anne McCaffrey. It answers many questions raised in the previous books, but leaves enough unanswered, and raises more for at least one more sequel. Well done!"
5,Freedom's Ransom,"I truly enjoyed this book, as this is the second time I have purchased and read it. I have all of Anne McCaffrey's books and enjoy reading and re-reading them."
1,Did Anne McCaffrey really write this book??,"I found this book to be very inconsistent with McCaffrey's other writing. Not only was it a much more plodding book, with a ill-defined story line, but it did not continue the series well. Some characters just dropped out of sight. A couple of new characters were introduced for no apparent reason. The characters who continued from previous books didn't have the same voices and went from interesting, unique people to flat charicatures. References to the Eosi who plagued Botany in the first books suddenly had a different name -- an inconsistency that is rather unusual for McCaffrey. I was extremely disappointed and have a hard time believing that this was written by the talented author of the other Freedom books, the Dragonrider books, and all the other wonderful books she's written. She's never told a story so poorly, that I've read."
2,A Big Disappointment,"As a big McCaffrey fan, I had looked forward to this one. Unfortunately, it lacks the depth and character development of the earlier books in the series, and the plot is all over the place and boring at the same time. I found this the most disappointing of any book I have read by this author, and I've read all her SF."
2,"Description of a story, not a story itself","Freedom's Ransom could have have been a good story, but instead, it is a description of a story. Instead of dialog and action telling the story, the story is described in prose. It brings to mind the old line ""SHOW the reader, don't TELL her!"" This is definitely a book that could have used another rewrite to replace the tedious prose with dialog and action. This isn't the first of her books about which I'd make this same complaint."
1,How did the publisher let this one get to print?,"The ""Freedom"" series kept my interest up through the third book. This fourth one falls off a cliff. Imagine a universe where a few tons of automotive supplies and food has a measurable impact on the reconstruction of a looted and devastated Earth. Imagine one where interstellar travel is so cheap that bird carcasses, bananas, and coffee beans are the prized trade items. Repetitious descriptions and dialog, boring 1-D characters, a chaotic plot, bad science and inconsistent technology, absurd scale effects, and a host of other flaws make this a painful book to push through to the end. You'll also find ""exterior motives"" and ""one of the only"". Sad. How did the publisher let this one get to print?"
4,Continuing the adventure...,"Love it! Love it! Love it! A series that incorporates all my favorite genre: Romance, Sci-Fi, and Adventure! When the Third of the Freedom series ended I was told that it was the last! I felt like I had lost touch with family members! I am excited to have the saga continue in Freedom's Ransom. Hopefully there will be more to follow."
1,The first disappoint from Ms. McCaffrey,"I have really enjoyed reading the series but number 4 is a disappointment. There are so many other ascepts of this series that need to be explored that reading about the principal characters going out on a trading expedition for several hundred pages was not enjoyable. Hopefully number 5 and beyond will deal with things like conquered races, humans included, dropped on other Catteni worlds, are all the Eosi really gone and who are the Farmers?"
3,Not best effort....,"I enjoyed the first three books in this series too much to be impressed by this fourth installment. While the concept of looking at Botany's evolution after the Eosi downfall was interesting, I found the plot meandering, and the editorial errors distracting. Although sort of enjoyable, the book felt ""cobbled together"", and I expected more from my favorite author."
1,Can't believe that this was actually written by McCaffrey,"I enjoyed the first three books, and the idea of this one was good, but who wrote it?! And who edited it? Not up to standard, that's for certain!"
2,A mildly interesting book,"This is one of those books that keeps you reading, but only because you're sure the good part must be coming up next. The characterswere never in real danger and the interpersonal conflicts were mostly solved by shipping people off somewhere. The moments with the Masai were interesting, but too brief.I've enjoyed the romance between Zainal and Kris in the last three books, but they seem almost bored in this one.I was really looking forward to this book, hopefully the next one will have the spark back."
1,not what you think...,"My daughter has the whole collection, so I thought Id start my niece out with number 1. When you look at this doll something is missing.. so I did a side by side comparison with my daughters number 1. Wow there is no sparkle on the 1, its even curved. The ribbon is plain, the bow in the hair is the wrong color, the arm is too rounded. These are supposed to be quality pieces but its not there. Im so disappointed."
5,Josef One Year Doll,"I had collected Josef dolls for my daughter, and now I am beginning a collection for my great-niece. I began with the one year, but now I am purchasing the ""baby"" one for her for Christmas."
4,"Short, contained oav with a fast-paced story","Much darker in color scheme and tone from the original,Saber Marionette R tells the story of an obsessed clone trying toprove that he is greater than those who preceded him. If this sounds familiar, it's completely intentional. This story was the draft from which Saber Marionette J was created, and it's not too hard to see the prototypes for the personalities that were formed in J. The voice actors for R are the same as the ones in J, and it isn't too hard to see where some confusion might have crept in.Bloodberry is the one who is the most different in R, and is much more mature and likable. As for Lime and Cherry, they've simply gone through a redesign. I'd also like to say that I liked the design for Romanova, as it had both the touch of the modern and the charm of past and future in the form of trolleys and large motorized gondolas which carried people from point a to b."
5,Vai + Satch = Good....Vai + Satch + Yngwie = Better,I am re-reading some of the reviews here and want to make certain that folks interested in this CD are not deterred by some of the pedantic postings about Yngwie. Buy some of his music and then comment - aside from the poor lyrics the guitar (and often keyboards) is a blast. If you are basing your critique on this performance alone it is not fair though I am curious how you can (as a guitarist) watch and think Yngwie is sub-par (where he is in fact by far the most fun to watch).
5,G3'ss best,I beleive that this is the best of the G3 albums especially disc two. i have purchased their other releases and did not find them as good.
5,Oh yeah!,"Great CD to listen to while hanging around the house. I was a little disappointed that the songs satriani plays in the dvd set was not exactly the same as found on this disc. Turns out the dvd and the cd were recorded at two different locations. I would have liked the live version of Starry Night on this cd. However, Satriani's Mystical Potato Head Groove Thing is amazing live. I bought the dvd as well as this disc since alternate set lists were played in the dvd (Yngwie's dvd set is much better in my opinion). It's a whole new level to see it in addition to hearing it. And of course the G3 jam is crazy as always. Although the songs are the same for the G3 jam, the guitar playing and solos in the songs are different than on the dvd since the three improvised their riffs on stage. I like the dvd version but the cd is still worth the money."
5,"If you like Satriani, Vai, & Yngwie, you'll enjoy this","I went to the glenside PA show and thought the DVD was better (probably because they were being filmed and wanted to make a good showing). I liked Joe's set the best, his riffs and melodies just seem a notch above Vai, and far superior to Yngwie. Vai is still quite good though. Yngwie could be so much better if he could just take it out of warp drive once in a while to tease the audience (for what is coming). I liken his playing to a flat out drum solo without peaks and valleys - it gets boring quick.The dvd also has some nice close-ups of the fret work. I felt it was worth the price."
4,perhaps chapters 7 and 8 are the most useful?,"Lawson gives the Oracle DBA many useful ideas on customising your Oracle database. He pretty much assumes you already possess a reasonable background in Oracle. There is no wasted space on elementary SQL or Oracle tasks.Perhaps the key chapters are 7, ""Oracle Pathologist"" and 8, ""Analysing SQL Bottlenecks"". Later chapters add important refinements. But if you are in search of quick gains, chapters 7 and 8 could be the most fruitful. The ideas in those might not have to involve a major overhaul of your architecture."
4,Good place to start,This book is a great place to start to learn about performance tuning for Oracle. The book covers the different type of performance tuning methods in a neutral and matter of fact manner. I like the candidness of the author and the fact that he does not push or suggest one method is better than any other. Use this book to start to understand the different methods then move on to more in depth books on a particular performance tuning method. Take a moment and look at the Table of Contents
2,not bad,"I wouldn't buy it again, my puppy is teething and will barely touch it. Frozen solid the bone is barely cool on the outside."
3,Filling is key...,"This toy works fine, as long as you use a flavored broth of some sort. We used chicken broth and the dogs loved it, but when we tried just water it got no love..."
5,He loves it,"I have a pug who is always needing things to distract him to keep him from destroying my things. I put some chicken broth into the bone and frooze it over night. He loves it and will not put the bone down. It was an instant hit. I used organic chicken broth from sheltons because dogs need to avoid preservatives and additives when they are small especially. It has about 3 servings for the can and went in easily. I froze it on a plastic bag. It expanded and the broth was comming out the holes. He instantly got atrracted to the bone. He is a poltry lover so he really liked this. He likes frozen treats and it is winter, but he is inside eating this. He is very serious about this new treat. He is also crewing on the bone plastic. It is a great new invention. Kyjen just needs to keep thinking like a pug. They have great toys for them. It was also easy to fill. I did it in the sink because it was a bit messy."
4,Seduces your senses!!!,"Bought this from Amazon and was thrilled with delivery and the scent of this fragrance.This product does as it says, it seduces your senses. It's subtle not too loud, I've been complemented on how great this fragrance smells. It has a great staying power...hours after I spray some on, it smells as though I recently put some on. My only problem is that, it makes me sneeze alot...so I don't use it as often...Otherwise it's a great scent for a woman or even a teenager."
2,Not a complete Grille!,"There was a big problem with this order! I wanted a chrome grille, which is shown in the photo on the web-site! How ever after ordering, I received ""7 chrome grille inserts"" which is not what I thought I was ordering! The web site owner said there were problems as to what photos they could use on the web site, he was very nice and resolved the issue by giving me a full refund!"
5,This is great!,"I got this DVD set for Christmas, and it is excellent! These are the newer Home Videos, starring Tom Bergeron as the host, who, in my opinion, is a much funnier and more charismatic host than Bob Sagat was. (not that Bob Sagat was bad, just kinda cheesy). Now you can watch all the hilarity without having to sit thorough commercials, and it's good fun to watch some of the clips in slow motion to really capture the moment. At any rate, home videos was always a funny show, and has always been one of my favorites. I was quite surprised to get this as a gift, as I didn't even know it had been released on DVD. Very recommended for good times!"
4,Funny,"No commercials, the quality isn't too good (it seems like it was recorded from old VCR tapes). My dad loved it though, nice present."
2,"Videos are funny, Tom Bergeron is not","I got a review copy of this and decided to torture myself with AFV, just to see how long I could take it. Answer: Less than an hour was enough to make me walk away.Don't get me wrong: watching someone get hit in the crotch can be funny. And some of the videos were genuinely humorous, but host Tom Bergeron could suck the fun out of a circus. His segueways are so belabored, he has to turn to the Jay Leno method at least twice a show to remind people that all the laughter he gets is out of pity. At least he can recognize it.Suitable for almost all physical ages, but people with normal human adult intelligences might want to steer clear of repeated contact. Maybe it won't cause brain damage, but about three shows in and I was ready to start scooping out my gray matter with a spoon to end the misery."
4,A pleasant story,"In this story, Little Owl learns to fly with the help of his mother. The story is a simple story about building confidence. The illustrations are watercolor, and all of the animals are fuzzy. The book isn't a classic, but it is a pleasant bedtime story. It gets an extra star for helping my two year-old deal with a sudden fear that owls would ""get her."""
2,An unfortunate turn of events,"As a 30+-year lover of Rudolfo Anaya's work, I must say I was rather disappointed with ""Jemez Springs.""Anaya distinguished himself and his work through tales such as ""Bless Me, Ultima"" and ""Tortuga""; stories and themes as timeless as the Rio Grande Valley and its presence. Those tales, flawlessly told by Anaya, call to be read and remembered numerous times.""Jemez Springs,"" however, needs only to be read once. Whether by pressure of deadline or the simple need to tie up a few loose ends, Anaya comes across as a self-indulgent retired literature professor, attempting heavy-handed ties between New Mexicanos and their culture and forms of Greek and other literature, while tying them only with the loosest of whip stitches.If you are an Anaya fan, you owe it to yourself to read ""Jemez Springs,"" but then give yourself a good dose of ""Ultima"" to wash away the bitter aftertaste."
2,okay,"I am a big fan of Rudy Anaya and the Sonny Baca series. This book, however, was disappointing. It was very wordy in that there was not much conversation going on. I am a native of NM, but no longer live there. One thing that I always loved about the Sonny Baca series is the description that went into talking about NM, NM food and the people. I didn't get that with this book. This book did not live up to any others by R. Anaya."
3,Quality t-shirt,The quality of the t-shirt is good. Not sure if my brother in law ever wore it though!
2,Buy Born to Shop: Italy instead,"I think that Born to Shop: Italy is far more informative and instructional. It is also more personalized with additional information on favorite hotels and cafes located in the vicinity of favorite shops. There seems to be much more information on bargain and outlet shopping, which Where to Wear ignores. Where to Wear also does not discuss price ranges and seems to assume that the reader is extraordinarily wealthy. I am taking the two books to Italy next month and will comment more later if I change my opinion!"
3,I love it so much but BEWARE!,"I loved the flavor so much but if you are prone to ulcers in your mouth or canker sores - please avoid this one. In all the sensitive area on the underside of my tongue, the worst canker sores developed. Apparently some people are allergic to the sodium lauryl ___ in the toothpaste (which as I understand it, holds the flavor) - that combined with the cinnamon and clove flavors - erupted into the worst mouth ulcers. Please be careful I would hate for anyone to go through what I went through. I am fine with other Tom's of Maine flavors."
5,"Very pleased, everything doesn't have to be mint flavored","I needed to use a toothpaste that did not contain mint. I had been using baking soda and peroxide for a long time. I couldn't find this cinnamon and clove version of Tom's of Maine at local stores, so was forced to order in bulk online. The flavor is easy to get used to (reminds me of Dentine gum), leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, and my teeth appear to be getting whiter. My teenage child also approves."
5,The perfect beginning and end to each day,"Tom's of Maine toothpastes are always refreshing, making my mouth feel alive to start the day and clean and fresh to end the day. The best toothpastes I have ever used."
1,Don't buy this dvd!,"Ok let me start off by saying that I am a big Family Guy fan, I even like American Dad. I was so trilled when Fox put Family Guy back on the air. With that said, This dvd should be titled Seth McFarlane's Cavalcade of Crappy Cartoons because it sucks!Even after reading tons of bad reviews I still got the dvd, all I can say is it was a total waste of time. It's not very funny. It just sucks! Anyway i'm just trying to give the warning I didn't take. Buy it only if you got the money to total blow and have nothing better to blow it on because thats what you will be doing."
2,Disspointed,"I love Seth MacFarlane,. LOVE HIM. But wow,. was I ever upset I spent that money on this dvd. I should have settled for the youtube clips or a friend lending it to me. It's fun in the beginning but it gets stale FAST and halfway through if not sooner you start thinking to yourself,... I could've bought the family guy movie but didnt,. damn. I'm not a cheapskate, I always indulge in comedy of all kinds, especially when it comes to Seth Macfarlane but that's how bad it was,. because I didn't get it on some sort of 4.99 sale,.. I wanted my money back."
1,Pretty Bad,I was extremely disappointed with this dvd. I'm a huge fan of Family Guy and so I expected a lot more. I probably laughed twice during the movie. The only positive? It's only an hour!
2,Disappointing,"Considering the success and multilevel humor of The Family Guy, I expected MUCH more from this BD. Instead, it contained a disjointed collection of vapid sketches, lightly salted some naughty language. It was almost as if the sketches were early musings of what eventually proved to be a much funnier final production, but with no final production!Technically, the BD itself was flawless with stunning sound and picture. When it hits the $5 DVD bin at Wal-Mart, this BD will be a great addition to your disc library."
3,MacFarlane's Cavalcade,"MacFarlane is good no question, but the vignettes in this one are a bit uneven, it's still worth a watch."
5,This was a gift.,"My sister wanted this so much, I added it to her Christmas stocking. She must really like it a lot since she's visually challenged."
2,"A few laughs, but not many","On the whole, I wouldn't recommend this. I'm a fan of Family Guy and to some extent American Dad, so I expected to like this, but it was pretty disappointing. There were a few good scenes, but I found myself not laughing throughout most of it. Also, $16 is a ripoff for less than an hour of material. You can get an entire season of Family Guy for $26!If you like Family Guy's cutaways to random things, you'll probably enjoy this. I personally find most of the cutaways annoying, so maybe that explains why I didn't care too much for this."
2,Wow...what an eye opener!,"I knew Seth was twisted, but I never knew just how much. The only reason I give this DVD two stars is that I did find some of the clips very funny. However, if you like lots of homosexuals and gay jokes, bestiality, toilet humor, and too much sex with robots, household objects, celebrities, etc. then, this is for you. Otherwise, you can catch a lot of the tamer stuff on YouTube. Also, way too much use of the F word. Seth MacFarlane loves to swear. A LOT. And although that's not uncommon these days, for me, it takes away from the humor if it's done too much. This DVD really got me thinking about Seth's sick and twisted sense of humor. It's really bad if left unchecked by the networks. In the future, I think I'll just stick with Family Guy. I know at times that can be over the top, too, but not this bad!! As Peter Griffin would say, Ah, crap!!"
2,Not what I expected...,"I really enjoy Family Guy, but these are basically the little clips that they cut away to during the show. They go on way too long and aren't funny. Don't waste your money."
2,Not great,"Several good scenes, most other scenes so-so. I like ""Family Guy"" 'Guess I expected better."
3,"R-rated outtakes, gets less funny the more you see it","The first time through, this DVD actually elicited a few LOLs, but a second time through, the choppy nature - each clip is introduced with a silent black screen title - becomes distracting, and the gags get tired unusually quickly, whereas I usually find Family Guy 'sodes funny after dozens of viewings.It really seems like, although I don't think it is, a collection of Family Guy gags that didn't make it past the censor. Unless you're a hard-core Family Guy fan, wait until it becomes available at a (much) lower price"
1,Garbage,"Need I say more than the title? Okay...so I absolutely love Family Guy, and when me and my girlfriend were at the store and saw this I purchased it without hesitation, thinking I was in for another treat from Seth McFarlane. WRONG! It was nothing more than a bunch of short, random, RETARDED scenes that were not even funny. I am so sorry I wasted me and my girlfriends time. Please do yourself a favor and don't waste yours. There should be a lower rating than this, this doesn't even deserve a percentile of a star."
1,"Pitiful,compared to Family Guy.","As a fan of Family Guy i was very disappointed in Calvalcade of Cartoon Comedy,very raw to obscene humor that is not even funny(at least when George Carlin cussed he made me laugh).Running time is less than an hour and i still fell asleep on it.I wouldn't even rate this 1 star but you cant rate it lower.Stick with Family Guy(including star wars parodies)or American Dad,more bang for your buck.Do not buy this product you will regret it."
2,"A few chuckles, but overall disappointing and overpriced","It's a shame this cost 15 dollars. Its running-length is less than an hour, and there really are no special features to make up for it, other than a look at the premiere, which, of course, is about as thrilling as it sounds. What the creators really should have done was added the ""cavalcade"" in as an extra, then went back and made something that's actually good, and worth spending 15-20 bucks on, for the feature. Rent, don't buy this one."
3,"Funny, but Blu-Ray version is obsolete.","Let me start by saying, I'm a HUGE fan of just about anything Seth MacFarlane puts his name on. I was REALLY looking forward to this coming out on Blu-Ray and I was expecting bright colors and razor-sharp clarity. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. Every site I looked on before this officially came out had a different aspect ratio listed for this title.The truth is, its a lame 1.33:1 full screen presentation that is, at best, as good looking as a standard DVD upscalled to HD. Simply meh. The very few special features that ARE included are in 480p. I'm really surprized they bothered to include a DTS Master Audio track on this title, because the majority of the skits are just two people talking.In the end, I can't reccomend buying this on Blu-Ray without feeling bad. Buy the DVD version. It will look basically the same and you'll be able to play it on just about any computer or set top player."
1,5 YAWNS for every 1 Chuckle,"I had high hopes for this DVD - The Family Guy creator without the restrictions of network TV. The DVD consists of a bunch of short ""skits"". A few are very funny, most are boring, and a few are downright stupid. For example, there is a skit of a Scotsman watching movies and commenting on them - it gets old after the first movie, and then they come back to it later in the DVD for more yawns. There are a lot of infantile sex scenes, which would not necessarily be bad if they could be done with the genius twist that Seth usually has. Unfortunately they come off as being written by a 12 year old, and probably only a 12 year old would find them amusing. I now have the feeling that Seth is more funny when he is trying to get around the TV censors than when he is not restricted at all. I hope he got this out of his system so he can try to get Family Guy back on track at last.VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
1,A real disappointment. Don't waste your money.,I'm a huge Family Guy fan but this just doesn't work. It is just a bunch of 5 second clips. It's completely random. These kinds of clips work when they are inserted in the Family Guy stories but on their own it isn't very funny. And there is nothing very shocking at all. There is some swearing that you wouldn't hear on normal TV but you can get that by watching any South Park episode.
1,Terrible. Not a single laugh.,"I don't write many reviews but I felt compelled to help others trying to decide to purchase/watch this DVD. First of all, almost every clip has profanity and sexual humor in it so it's definitely not for kids. I sat through the entire DVD (about 100 or so clips/jokes) and can't recall *one* clip that was truly funny. It's a mess of a DVD that was apparently made to cash in on Family Guy's popularity. My recommendation is that you forget this DVD even exists as you'll very likely regret wasting both 54 minutes of your life and $15."
3,Great show,"Very funny, just what you would expect for Seth McFarland. edgy and offensive and perfect combination.definitly worth the money. ha"
1,Disappointing,"I am a fan of Family Guy and have been for years. But like I felt with The Cleavland Show and American Dad, this Cavalcade of Comedy is not all that funny. A definite miss."
1,Just Not Worth Any Money,"While I am a huge fan of Seth McFarlane and his works, this was an item I bought despite the reviews, and was thoroughly disappointed. It is, in short, a skit-collection of thoughts Seth McFarlane had for Family Guy, that he wasn't able to work in. While there was a few semi-funny skits, most are pointless and dull. I do not recommend spending even $5 for this item.Now Ted... Buy it!"
2,not best effort,I expected more from MacFarlane than the 7th grade level situations and characters. He does a much better job on his regular commercial work. The writing was disappointing.
2,Not Impressed,"I've been a Seth MacFarlane fan for years, so after seeing a couple of clips from this on YouTube and laughing my A** off, I decided to buy it. Unfortunately, the two clips I saw on YouTube were the only funny ones on the DVD. So, if you're a Seth MacFarlane fan and NEED to see this for some reason, I would say rent it, borrow it from a friend, or buy it REALLY CHEAP used instead of spending the money to buy it new...because it really is not worth what I paid for it."
2,Not one of MacFarlane's best cartoons,I am a huge family Guy fan and was disappointed with buying this video because it was not that funny and it was under 60 minutes long. There were some skits which were good to laugh too but it did not make up for the whole video. It is best to rent this video versus buying it.
1,Terrible!,"I am a HUGE fan of Family Guy and American Dad! I never miss an episode of both shows and own all the seasons that are available DVD. I have been a fan of Seth MacFarlane for years, but this DVD is crap! I don't know what he was thinking, but he was out of his mind to release these cartoons.Out of all the mini-cartoons included, I only ""lightly"" laughed at a few. Most are not funny and have to do with sick and twisted humor about bestiality or inbreed families. I don't know how Seth could think his work included is funny. If I were him, I'd be embarrassed."
2,Seen it all before.,"When I saw that this was coming out, I was really looking forward to it but now that I have it, I'm completely dissappointed with it. If you've seen Family Guy or own all of the seasons, you've seen most of this dvd already. It has a few new clips but it's definitely not worth the money. It would've been better as a bonus dvd added in with the Family Guy seasons."
3,Youtube,These are jokes that didn't make the cut for Family Guy/American Dad. The Worst part is you can watch (download if you can figure it out) for free. Don't waste your money go to YouTube.[...]Enjoy
1,I should have listened!,"Found this in the bargain rack for $8. I had previously read some of the bad reviews but thought since Im a huge Family Guy fan and for $8, Id try it. Big mistake. Its just plain dumb."
3,ok..,"Not really all that funny, kinda disturbing and stupid but some parts are funny and for what i paid for it a i guess it was worth it."
1,"""This Isent Funny"" ""What???""","I Am A Big Fan Of Seth MacFarlane's Work (Family Guy, The Cleveland Show, American Dad!) But This Is Just Boring.. A Few Of These Shorts Give A Nice Little Laugh, But Not The Family Guy ""Laugh""Everything Seems Bland, And Uncreative..Very Poor Comedy.. If I Had To Score This Out Of 10 It Would Be A 2.."
3,Better off as cutaway gags,"Like the title said, these shorts are better off as cutaway gags in Family Guy. The Best shorts are the ones that spoof cartoon stars from years gone by. I give this dvd a 6 out of 10."
2,Too Expensive for too Few Laughs in Less than one Hour,"This ""movie"" is less than one hour. I think that is the first thing that should be pointed out when you're considering whether you should buy it or not. It does have some funny moments, but there is just not enough of them to be worth how much this thing costs. If you're a big Family Guy fan and have the cash to spare it might be worth it for you. It just didn't have enough laughs for me to be worth it."
1,What a WASTE of money,"As a fan of Family Guy & American Dad, I had high hopes for this DVD. It's not worth the disk it's burned on! (1) It not HD so why bother with BluRay? (2)It's not wide screen, it's 4:3. (3) It's encoded with 7.1 DTS MA. Guess what, it's realy only stereo. Now to the cartoon shorts. Not even a chuckle. I kept advancing chapters hoping to find something funny. Nada. So save your money and let Amazon keep this disk on thier shelves. Shame on you Seth for turning this out with the ""From the creator of Family Guy & American Dad"" as a selling point. Even the Fox network wouldn't want this."
1,Not worth the money,"Wow, how can I illustrate the depths of my disappointment with this purchase? I spent my money happily on the Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy, expecting to be delighted and amused like I always am by Family Guy and American Dad. Sadly, I received a steaming pile of junk. This is not worth the DVD it was printed on- I think I laughed at two of the sketches. TWO! In an hour! Uncensored in this case does NOT mean funny."
1,Save Your Money and Avoid this Piece of Crap,"I bought the DVD with high hopes, because I love Family Guy and American Dad and most other McFarlane's work, but this DVD is just crap. Utter crap. The cartoons were mostly not funny, some were mildly entertaining with a few giggles, but 98% of the cartoons were just not funny and overly blunt. For $20 I was expecting some good stuff, but really it's just mediocre crap. If I could return the DVD and get my money back, I would. I miss my $20 bucks more."
1,Ripped Off,"I wish I had looked at the reviews before making my purchase. But, with my love for The Family Guy, I just knew this was a must have DVD. How very wrong I was. Read Tobor Redrum's review because it's exactly how I feel. I can't believe I paid $15 to not even laugh out loud once."
2,Deleted Scenes from Family Guy,"Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon of Comedy is basically deleted scenes from Family Guy. The scenes are short and mostly all under one minute. I enjoyed Bob Dylan talking to Tom Waits. I got this movie in a sale and i'm glad I did, do not pay full price for this movie. You can view all shorts online and the unedited stuff is really not that funny. Save your money and watch them online."
2,Not impressed,I was disappointed in this workout. Not a challenge at all. It is defintely for beginners.
2,Less Than Impressed,"I have to say after reading the reviews I was excited to get this DVD and add it to my growing collection of fitness DVDs. Now that I have it and done the work out I am less than impressed. My abs hardly got the workout I was expecting. Perhaps I wasn't concentrating my abs enough, but I was trying my hardest to feel it in my abs and I just wasn't. So to make a long story short I will be looking for another DVD to replace this one!"
2,Not impressed,I was not impressed at all with this dvd especially after viewing so many. It consisted mainly of stretching and very little work out. It did not isolate the different muscles at all. A total waste of money.
2,Not that challenging,"Maybe it means that my abs are super-strong under all the flab, but I didn't find this workout very challenging. I haven't tried the bonus workout yet, but although I enjoyed Muscle Eats Fat, this didn't have me breaking a sweat."
3,It's Just OK,"I have so many exercise videos, and to be honest I am not sure this is one of the best. I was expecting a better workout, and I did not think the instructions were very clear. I'll keep trying, though"
2,Should have listened...not worth the money,"I should have listened to ""So, so workout"" who previously reviewed this DVD. It was definetly too short (not enough exercises). I assumed that the person who wrote ""so, so workout"" liked long abs sessions (which I do not), however, this workout only had about 4 or 5 different exercises w/ short reps. (The box suggests that the workout is ~15 minutes, but the instructor is thorough and takes a long time to explain the proper technique-- which is great). However, I would NOT have spent the money for this workout. There is only one ab workout on the tape (tape does have short warm up and cool down)."
2,"Way, waaay too easy. But why?","Based on the reviews on this board, I bought this DVD. The main thing I read on this board was, ""you must concentrate on the moves, etc., etc.""So I did. I really, REALLY focused. I felt nothing. I was if I hadn't really worked out at all. I tried this DVD for two weeks and did not get a single thing out of it. I don't think I did anything wrong, I just did not get a workout from this DVD. :-("
4,Fool's So Good,"American Fool was John Cougar's major breakthrough. The album was buoyed by two major hits ""Hurts So Good"" and ""Jack & Diane"". The former has a heavy guitar riff that sounds like a motorcycle revving up and it S&M; stylings perfectly fit the leather clad rebel rocker image he had at the time. The former has an equally memorable guitar riff, but the song is a reminiscence about days gone by and dealing with growing up. ""Hurts So Good"" went to number two and ""Jack & Diane"" became his only number one single and both songs ended up among the ten biggest of 1982. The rest of the album contains some equally pleasing tracks like ""Thundering Hearts"", ""China Girl"", ""Danger List"" and ""Hand To Hold On To"". The album also went to number one and so far is the only one of his to do so.The bonus track on this album is the would be title track and it should have been included on the original release."
5,little ditty 'bout jack and diane,"american fool is a classic album. it has three top 20 hits. jack and diane hit#1,hurts so good hit#2, and hand to hold on to hit#19. the songs weakest moments,danger list,close enough,and can you take it are good too. why did his record company say this album would ruin his career? it dudn't,john mellencamp became more successful after this album came out.it spent 9 weeks at #1. this is an amazing album. ed wilson"
3,"Looks Intriguing, but...","It doesn't look like it could weigh 2000lbs (as per the Product Details, Sept.9,'12), which is a good thingsince it would be extremely difficult to move if it actually weighed that much. I believe the real weight in closer to 100lbs.My main concern, which is unaddressed in any web-ad you'll find, is why the IMER Wheelman II ELECTRIC drive HAS a 1/2 horsepower motor, while the GAS version has a 3 hp engine?!? Is 1/2 hp REALLY ENOUGH to turn that tub when it's full of wet mix, AND not dramatically shorten the working-life of the motor and gear drive?Makes me say hmmm...."
5,Taste great and less filling,"With apologies to Miller Lite for the title,our 3 dogs are thrilled to get these. We've tried many types, inexpensive and premium, trying to find a vegetarian friendly, low fat treat that didn't have to be broken into a bunch of pieces and that they all 3 would like.Although we have pretty good size dogs (Golden, Border Collie, and Malamute)these would work well with small dogs also as they are about the size of a quarter.The tastes great part came because these smell like homemade molasses cookies. Of course I had to try one because the dogs love them-there's nothing nasty in them, all good ingredients. Tastes kind of like an Oreo, but less sweet.So this is a really good deal on these. Too bad for a couple of reviewers' dogs that they didn't sit well but that's what you have to do, keep trying different types until you find what works with your animal. May want to try one box first from your store before buying 6 of them here, eh?"
5,Hannah loves these!,"My five pound toy Poodle loves these! She is on a low fat diet due to some pancreas problems (don't ask) and these just fit the bill! Of course I break these in half to keep her weight just right. I almost want to snatch one myself, they smell so good.I know about dogs refusing things so don't be too upset if your dog refused these. I got some very expensive vitamins from the holistic vet to try to build her up after she was sick. She absolutely refused to touch them no matter what I did. I tried a year later and she still won't touch them! She got better after the medical treatment and has stayed healthy. Go figure!"
5,The dogs are nuts for these,The dogs love them. What dog doesn't like peanut butter. The right size for larger dogs for training. Good size for small dogs (mine) as a treat. I break them into a smaller size for training.
2,Dog didn't think much of them.,"My German Shepherd didn't think much of these... no real interest or excitement in them like the chicken jerky treats from Costco that she REALLY likes and gets excited for, but she did eat the Blue Dog treats along with her regular food so I guess they didn't go to complete waste. I would not buy these again."
3,Maybe not for puppies,"I bought these treats for my 3 month old Bichon/poodle. She likes the taste, but enjoys playing with them more as they are too hard to bite. Still, outside the fact that my husband thought the abandoned toy was a puppy turd, they are by far her favorite treat."
1,My dog won't eat them,"Since these were so highly rated by so many customers, I bought a bunch of these for my dog. Much to my surprise, he does not like them. If I offer him one, he will smell it in my hand, and sometimes take from me but drops it on the ground immediately. Too bad! I was hoping to use these to motivate him for training"
1,Blue Dog treats,"Blue Dog treats, I purchased 2 boxes and my dog will not eat them so I'm giving them to my neighbors dogs. I will never order them again."
5,beautiful,A wonderful family keepsake. Well written and well presented in a beautifully artistic work. Something to read to children. An answer to a life long question. Is Santa Claus real? Or Saint Nicholas? Wonderful!
3,Not for children who believe in Santa,"I gave this book to my 9 year old daughter before I had a chance to read it. I usually look through books pretty thoroughly first, but it didn't occur to me that the author would mention several times that Santa Claus was a fiction. Fortunately, she makes the case that Saint Nicholas was very real. We've been telling our daughter for some time now that God gives special graces to Saints, and that helps to explain the Santa/Saint Nicholas story regarding the gifts that appear on Christmas. Just be forewarned if you'd like to give this book to a young child."
2,Lacking Good Technical Content,"Just finished reading the book and I must say that this book is lacking good technical content. It focused more on trivial things and explained them too in-depthly. Plus, it seems that windows based design was the focus and web based design was brought in as an afterthought. It doesn't nearly have as much content or good design recommendations. Also, don't even get me started on the introduction of ""Avalon"" into the book. This chapter was completely out of place in this book. The lackluster chapter described something thats a year or more off, not to mention stuff that is going to change. Not anywhere in this chapter did it explain good design patterns for Avalon, as currently there are none. This chapter seemed more of an ""intro to avalon"" chapter - which is why I thought it was out of place."
4,Hear me Roar,"I agree with the previous reviewer. If you are like me, always on the lookout for a not-too-serious books in a sociology section, you may enjoy it, as well. I am giving this book four stars only because at some point the zoology comparisons can wear you out."
5,Realistic portrayal of Carrier Life apres Tailhook!,"C.W. Morton presents a startling, explicit, and at times grisly view of Navy life aboard a modern day aircraft carrier. Her novel lacks nothing in realistic descriptions; equal to Tom Clancy in her grasp of nuance and detail. Protagonist NCIS agent Bud Wilson deals with very real but unexpected aspects of criminal investigation detail on a day by day basis as he carries on a homicide inquiry on slain pilot Gina Worthington. While tracking down skinhead saboteurs intent on mayhem, investigating suspicions of espionage abord the carrier, Bud becomes a character who's life becomes our own through each page turn - reliving the rush of attack jet flight, life in the Hanoi Hilton, right to the startling conclusion. A good read, an engrossing page turner, and a super beginning to a Bud Wilson series!"
3,The Sky is the limit!,"Having recently been given the honors of creating a wedding video for someone, I can relate to some of the antics of this one. Honestly I expected more from this film. It is funny however as the photographer hired to do a gay wedding video gets his eyes and ears full of people invited to this non traditional wedding. Theres not a dull moment, and at least in the end the video comes together very nicely in spite of it all. That's about the only part of this wedding that came off without a hitch. A lot of surprises, great casting, good quality for the most part, but the plot could have been done a little more dramatic for my taste. Not a total waste of money however. I recommend it to anyone who is not extremely picky and who are looking for something a little different. Don't expect a world class motion picture, and you should enjoy it."
2,RSVP = 0,RENT THIS FIRST! Are all those posts Norm and Clints? This was absolutely dreadful! Heather B was the only funny and natural thing about the movie. The rest were boring and lame if you ask me. It was so not funny or even a good parody. Blechh! Put this in the discount bin where it belongs. I'll give it a couple of stars as credit towards what they were trying to accomplish and the extras.
1,yeah,"I disagree with some of the 1 star reviews below, but i have to say that, why a antenae, if you are buying off of amazon.com, with a *computer* than you obviously have enough money for that, unless someone gave it to you, oh wait interweb isn't free. yeah why would you ever buy a antenae, thats just plain dumb, go get a dish for 25 bucks somewhere. or cable, then you could share your interweb bill with you tv bill. Common sense people. anways Jensen isn't a very good brand, go RCA or sony all the way."
2,"Bought it, hated it",I bought this one thinking it would be great. It is not. Callas is no my type. I don't like her voice or her appearance.
4,very readable,"This book managed to be easy to read despite the large amount of information within its pages. I found it to be inspiring without being too heavy, and informative without leaving me wracked with guilt and anxiety."
4,a much needed balm,"Good things are possible, keep at it, it will take a while, but, it is not impossible! Even the review here at Amazon by Ms. Nina Rosenberg shows the uphill distance we have to go. Let's all keep walking, and even invite Ms Rosenberg along, maybe offer her a cup of tea. Anyhow, I loved this book and feel that we need to sometimes focus on what is good, and what HAS been accomplished and try to understand how it was acomplished so that we too may pave the way to greater peace, for all. Yes, not just for the USA, but for all citizens of the world. If you liked this book, I suspect you might also enjoy a book on non-violence called ""nonviolence: twenty five lessons"" by Mark Kurlansky.Don't give up, keep at it, keep the faith, ward off despair!"
1,Pure Drivel,"This book is not for citizens, as it says on the cover, it is for uneducated, closed minded people who feel perfectly justified in explaining how wrong the majority of the American people are. This book is not about hope, unless what you hope for is for the country and the planet to be taken over by these nutballs. FYI, there are things in this world worth fighting and dying for, even if people of other nations are involved. There are things that are not worth fighting and dying for, such as fighting for the right to choose the WRONG, and rub it in the faces of others who know better.If you are a patriot, if you think we live in a country founded on agency, and the inspiration of those who gave and or wore out their lives to create it, then do not waste a moment on this book."
4,Must see television !,This stuff is the basis of the 50'S! Reeves was the #1 hero of his generation. You should see this historical footage.
3,Otwaygeous !,"There are laugh out loud moments in this roller coasting master-class of self deprecating humour. A real fun read - not a page fails to keep you smiling.Here's a guy who refused to be a clone: John Otway's entire career is a stunningly original work of performance art in its own right.This British pop wannabe was a genius at finding creative publicity angles and remaining ever optimistic despite calamitous facts to the contrary and this generates much of the humour.Otway and his on/off musical partner Wild Willy Barrett (a guitarist with an a excellent feel, whose unique electric sound came out of a scaffold plank with a classical guitar neck bolted on) together recorded some real pop gems that bear investigation. They hailed from Aylesbury and an England that is already lost forever.Give this book & the recordings of John Otway & Wild Willy Barrett a try."
1,This DVD is worth about $5 not $25,"If this were a book it would be about 20 pages long. It is a Powerpoint presentation from a guy you never see. There is no animation just still graphics. It lasts a total of about 45 minutes long. At the end he says ""these strategies are described in detail in the segments that follow"". Problem is, nothing follows,..it is the end of the DVD. Weird?? This is a bad investment."
4,Pretty good sensitivity,"It has very good sensitivity.Just don't use it for rock.If you play classic music, it's a perfect fit."
5,Great book for beginners to moderate.,"This book addresses several skill levels. Basic construction is detailed. The items used for building the robots are pretty much every day items, and generally do not require special items to be purchased. There is a section for those who want to add electronics and motors. Great for a family project."
4,"Shorter than Callanetics, yet amazingly effective","I have a short attention span. Period. After twenty minutes, I'm in my own world. I adore Callanetics, but the workout is an hour long and one's mind (namely mine) starts to go elsewhere.The Lotte Berk Method is extremely effective, and after two weeks I noticed a difference in my strength and ability in my own dance. When added to the others in the series, it's an excellent workout. It may not seem like much at first, but if you TRULY concentrate on what you're doing, tucking, and holding that stomach in, in perfect form, it's amazing what this video can do.I recommend the DVD version due to the blast at the end.The only thing that prevented me from giving this 5 stars is that there should be a little bit more of a safety warning about knee dancing, as well as an alternative for those who may have had previous knee or thigh injury."
4,lotte berk dvd,"Was looking at more expensive work outsbut, decided to try this one foirst. Nice for a short work out. Arrived promptly from shipper. Thanks"
3,A little tough for me,"I tried it, but maybe I'm just too out of shape for this one. The positions are hard for me to balance and the series jumps from one position to another so I have to pause it so that I can prepare myself for the following position or to get a chair or a mat. Not for me at this point. Maybe would be good for others who are already in shape and want to tone-up."
2,I've Seen Better,"Honestly, if you've done The Bar Method DVD series, then this DVD is not that great in comparison.I like the technique that the instructor is using, which is why I bought the DVD. Unforunately, The Bar Method is a superior set. The Bar Method has a longer run time, similar challenging excercises, and I find the instructor more tolerable.This instructor seemed to be a bit arrogant.Anyway, if you are choosing between this and The Bar Method series, I'd go with the TBM. I might use this DVD to add variety to another short workout though."
4,"Good workout, but limited","I liked this workout quite a bit. It's different than anything else I've done; sort of like a ballet workout. The instructor gives clear, complete instructions, though she does tend to yell at you at a couple of points. You really do have to hang in there though, because some of these moves are *tough*! For the areas that it is targeting, it is a terrific, low-impact workout that you will definitely feel. I do wish, as someone else mentioned, that it included more than just a legs and arms workout. Guess you have to buy the other Lottie Berk tapes for that. I do recommend this DVD, though it is a bit pricey. See if you can get a deal on the whole set, and you'll have a fun, challenging, complete workout."
5,Very fun!,"I decided like so many others that it was time to get off the couch and get into shape. I read reviews about The Lotte Berk Method and took it for face value. I expected Jane Fonda in a tutu. I got something so different and so fun! It is difficult I will give you that, but it was an amazing work out.I am a true beginner and NOT that graceful (more KLUTZ), but the directions are easy to follow, Barbara the teacher is clear, concise, and very encouraging. As a beginner you will get heated up, you'll even sweat, your limbs will shake, but as soon as you start to wonder if you're body can do much more its over. It is the perfect amount of workout and really a lot of fun! It is a must. Barbara claims in 10 days you will feel a difference and in 20 you will see a difference. I will see about that and keep on doing it!"
4,well worth,"I've been trying this exercise for a few times already. I can't see any results yet, maybe because I don't follow any diets as well. But it is worth to practice these exercises at home. It seems to help you to strenghten and slim down your body. It's not too much but you can feel you have done some workout if you have a busy schedule. However, i found it's too short (less than 40mins) so I have to add another aerobic activities in to complete my own daily workout."
3,A few interesting moves but not a real work out.,"There were a few moves in this DVD that I have never seen done before and were interesting to try that may be good to just do to change up a boring routine. They really put a lot of emphisis on streatching which is great. However, I feel the workout was incomplete. It only targeted a few muscle groups and didn't make me push myself. Also the knee dancing was painful, and not a good painful way. I think if I would have tried this before I bought it I wouldn't have bought it."
5,Super workout!,"I just bought this DVD. I have done the workout and it was great! I loved the instructor--she is a great inspiration for those of us in our late 40's or early 50's. The workout was wonderful, my abs already feel tighter. This will be my main workout to supplement my gym and the Firm DVD workouts. I think one gets from the workout what they put into it. Follow all the instructor's instructions and one gets a great workout!"
3,It was ok,"I had to come back and edit my rating. Originally, I gave this product three stars. I was disappointed by how short it was and the exercises were kind of boring. I kept the DVD and I have done it a few times since. Now, I would give it 4 stars. Everytime I do it my legs shake and I can see definition on the front of my legs.This is definitely a good workout to add to your collection. After I changed my mind about this DVD I bought 2 other Lotte Berk DVDs. High Round Assets is also a good DVD."
5,Captivating excitement,"My son, a reluctant reader, began reading this book because we encouraged him to read more. It wasn't long until he couldn't put it down! Now he can hardly wait to read the sequel. This book is full of action and adventure that appeals to young boys. I highly recommend this book!"
5,nice!,"These earrings are sweet. They are exactly as advertised. Pay attention to the size listed. Don't just judge by the photo. They are tiny, but perfect for my new granddaughter."
2,"Bar is short and clunky, delivery was horrible!","This bar is short and clunky. It may have 9 lb, but you won't be able to stretch your arms, since it's too short.The Amazon packing did not survive the shipping process: the bar arrived in a insanely damaged cardboard tube, with plastic parts on the bar's ends smashed and foam enclosing the bar cut in the middle. I sent it right back! Thanks to Amazon for its return policy, but this was a complete waste of time!"
2,"Pretty, but leaks","This can leaks or drips regardless of how slowly oil is poured from it, leaving a ring of olive oil underneath after every use. It's not functional--it's a pain in the neck."
1,Defective - Dispenser Leaks,"Looks very nice - polished stainless steel. Seems very functional too with large capacity and a nice long spout for careful pouring. Unfortunately, as soon as I poured oil into it, the dispenser started leaking at the place where the spout is welded to the main body of the dispenser. Bad Chinese quality control I guess. So, if you buy one be prepared to go through an exchange until you get a good quality product."
1,Leaky Oil Can,"This oil can arrived with the lid off-center and when I filled it with olive oil, it leaked out of the bottom. I threw it in the trash!"
3,Oil Can,I really like the look of this oil can. It does have one design flaw though. If you fill it to the top with oil it doesn't give you a clean pour and seems to spill a little.
3,La Folia 1490 1701,"The quality of the recording is very good. The performance has high points and low points. For one thing, someone keeps moaning and sighing loud enough during the performance so as to distract the listener at times. Sometimes the castanets and percussion seem to be a bit awkward. The music is beautiful and haunting enough to overlook these minor shortcomings. I still loved it!Gil Sarabia"
4,Near Rice's Quality,"I got this book as I have an interest in this topic. I have read Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty series, and do consider this almost up to her standards. The character developments were just fine, the story line was excellent, and I could almost hear the screams, the passions, the pleasures, and be in the scene. It is terriffic."
4,Mature Sensative Skin,"Found that this product has NO FRAGRANCE so is great for Mature Sensative Skin. Somewhat thick, I have moisten my hands before I apply this to make it easier to apply."
2,chewy fortune cookies?,"yuck these cookies were awful. they are a strange kind of stale, they are chewy, its not cool. there were some interesting fortunes though. and thats what counts."
5,Best book on CM,"Best book on CM (based most on symplectic formulation). Extremely clear if one has enough patience to follow exactly the author's way and to work out the proposed stimulating problems. Contains an original way of introducing differential forms, integration of differential forms and homology/De Rahm's thm.: you fully get in the subject in few pages ! The first part does not make use of symplectic formalism but is also quite original and stimulating. The level is last yr. undergr. 1st yr. graduate. Very useful if used with E. ott (Chaos in Dynamical Systems) for studying nonlinear dynamics."
2,Not a book for those without moderate understanding of physics,"I've just started going through this book and so far I'm a little disappointed. I feel Newtonian mechanics are introduced in an unnecessarily confusing way and the author makes certain assumptions that compound this confusion. For example, the author assumes that mass of any particle is 1 throughout chapter 1 and 2. Therefore, when he defines the kinetic energy of an object, it is defined as (v^2)/2. I feel that so someone unfamiliar with basic physics, which could easily be the case for graduate mathematicians reading this book, that this is completely misleading at best. I would recommend that you only purchase this book if you already have a strong background in physics and are looking increase your understanding of the mathematics behind it."
2,No too crazy about this,"I was attracted by the Ray-ban brand, and the price. Unfortunately lesson learned, don't buy sun glasses that you can't fit first. I bought this pair of glasses and they are very small, children size. I have owned a couple of Ray-Ban sun glasses before, but this special pair I didn't like it."
5,"Attractive, Easy to Use, Fantastic Product","I love, love, love, this laptop stand for my new Macbook Pro 17""!!! I had looked at other stands in the stores and even bought one of them! But this wonderful stand not works well, it looks really, really, really nice sitting on my black granite bar -- yes, I am interested in looks, and usability!!! I purchased the black satin Speck cover and it sits on this stand and fits perfectly! It sits at just the right height, and at just the right angle. I like this so much I am going to back and find the iMac turntable!I totally agree with the reviewer that said ""every Mac should come with one of these in the box!"" I am so glad I decided to hunt around Amazon to find this because it is wonderful!One happy Mac user!"
4,performance,The Ilap 17 W is sturdy and the aluminum base makes an excellent heat dissipation sink. I use it in my MacBook Pro 17 inches which after prolong use gives off a lot of heat! I wish however if the height of the furthest end could have been adjusted so that the the user need not have to bend over.
5,actually a question,"with the powerbook g4 17"" with front slot load drive. Is there an openiong to use the drive or do you have to remove the comuter from the stand to load a cd?"
3,Front cushion keeps falling off,I bought the Ilap for my 17 inch macbook pro and it worked very well at first. I was a bit bulky with the padding but did an amazing job keeping my lap cool while using my computer. As you know the pro can run extremely hot and it gets very uncomfortable without support. After prolonged use though the front cushion gets quick loose and never seems to stay on any more. It constantly has to be readjusted and doesn't wrap well around the front support. The product would be much better if they didn't allow you to remove the front cushion or if it had a stronger velcro or other type of way to attach it. Given the price the design should be much better.
3,"Overpriced, but the best thing out there","It's pretty well made, but I certainly feel as though it's overpriced. It's the perfect size for my MBP 17"" 2.6ghz. The front pad is removable, and the bottom edge of the aluminum is flat and lightly cushioned by a fuzzy strip to keep from scratching. In my lap on the couch I almost prefer doing without the front pad, as it's not really wide enough to support my forearms, and is sort of annoying as a result. The rear pad is fine, and the overall design works well to keep the laptop's temp down.In bed it's great. I can put my knees up and the iLap rests against my legs, and the front pad keeps the laptop off my chest.The pads themselves are velvet fabric, which is a shame. Looks lame, picks up pet hair, etc. At this price, leather would be nice. After a few months the front pillowcase stretches and the pad sags off the edge.I'd love it if there were a decent alternative, but nothing else is close, so I'm happy to have this."
5,Outstanding accessory for a laptop,"I bought this to use with my 17"" MacBook Pro and it exceeds my expectations. I use it mainly on the desk or table, but do use it while on the couch, etc. The iLap offers plenty of real estate for the computer and the computer stays put. I prefer to use it without the front cushion as I'm a bit shorter than average and the iLap more than fills up my lap, so with the cushion off it seems to fit me better. It does a fantastic job of disipating heat. With the MacBook Pro in mind, that feature alone makes it a wise purchase. It probably isn't real condusive to being constantly on the go as it is fairly large and doesn't fold up into a small package. I looked at most of the 'other stands' and decided the iLap would best meet my needs. I haven't regretted my decision a bit."
3,Pampered pets,"Dogs, cats, birds and fish...all included. Lots of beds, for those with four legs and two. Lovely places to live, that's for sure. While the animals are beautiful I was disappointed by the lack of full-page photographs (not nearly enough). The book has cleaning hints for cloth (furniture and clothing), etc., as well as for companion animals (cleaning paws, baths). It has ideas about litterboxes, dog beds, how to disguise odors and choose fabrics for furniture and all the rest. It's an interesting book, pretty, informative and a bit high-end."
3,Lots of nice dog pictures in homes,Lots of dogs and owners in their homes and a few ideas that may help you petirize your home. Ok book but not what I expected.
5,Nice coffee table book,"This book is a really unique book giving some pretty good ideas for co-existing in your home with your animal partners. It is a book for those of us who enjoy spoiling our animals and finding ways to make their lives just as comfortable as our own. It gave me a few new ideas, but otherwise this book is an account of how some people are already living in a home with their pets successfully. I like the hidden catbox under the cabinet idea and so much more about this book. It definately makes you smile when you flip through the beautiful color pages. It's a great coffee table book for all animal lovers to enjoy and to find clever resources from."
1,Very disappointing,This reads like a who's who in NY decorating. Not useful for pet owners living in the real world.
2,not what i hoped for,This is a book about homes that have a pet in them. I wished for a book that was homes where pets were included in the design.Pretty pictures not much use.
2,Vogue Interiors for Pets..Dissapointing,"So I have a house full of animals, that for the most part get along, but I'm always on the look out on how I can do things different and how I might be able to change things in the house to accommodate this lifestyle. When I found this book on Amazon, it was a no-brainer that I needed it.I was wrong. I really didn't need this book. Not at all. If you are looking for cheap snapshots of celebs and psudo-celebs posing with their animals snuggled down in their Gucci designed dog-bed, then perhaps you should take a look at this. If you are thinking of things to do with your home to make your animals and you more comfortable; it's not in this book. Not at all.If you must own this book, try buying a used copy, otherwise you might find yourself smacking your head into this book shortly after a quick flip."
1,A big yawn,"This is little more than a coffee table picture book of homes of wealthy people who appear to have allowed (their?) pets inside long enough to be photographed.Nice homes, nice photography, and there is at least one animal in each picture."
3,A Sad Note,"I liked some of the ideas used in this book and thought the photography was very amusing. However it fell suddenly on a sad note while reading one of the captions to a picture of one of the pet owners. This particular owner's occupation was noted as being a fireman and since the rest of the book seemed to be centered around New York living I felt I had to investigate. Unfortunately my assumption was correct that his name was listed among the many New York City firemen who lost their lives on September 11th. My thoughts go out to his family as well as his pets and hope that the message of this book does not deprecate his memory in their hearts, but only sustain it."
5,excellent sneaker for running or walking,"This is my second pair of the Trail Sensor. Awesome support. I'm not a big runner and primarily walk every day in this shoe, some hiking included. I've spent years searching for a shoe that also accommodates my very high arch and this shoe is it! I'll be purchasing being another pair after this one has had it's day. hoping for a new color combo."
4,Buy this book before designing a case-control study,"If you are planning a case-control study, this book will be very useful, because it explains all steps,including sample size calculation and methods of analysis."
2,People are desperate,"That's what you really need to be to decide to publish books of this low caliber. I know it's a niche market so there aren't that many authors writing for AI kids. Still, they should be more interesting than this. My son thought it was boring and completely missed the AI aspect. Nice try, but too simplistic."
4,Cute episodes - we love Kirby!,There are some really cute episodes on this collection and any Kirby fan will enjoy them. My daughter really enjoys this DVD and I found myself sitting in and watching them with her. Very cute.
5,games,I just wanted to purchase the item because its all I wanted.I played with video games of netindo for a long time.
4,buen disco,"Sin duda alguna este es uno de los grandes discos de los cadillacs. No es un disco muy conocido, pero contiene grandes éxitos como el Satánico Dr Cadillac y Contrabando de Amor, así como un cover de la canción de Dandy Livingstone: Rudy a Message to you. Tiene otras canciones como El mensaje soy yo en la cual los Cadillacs juegan con otros ritmos, que por suerete abandonaron."
1,Not what I expected...,"I had heard that Chocoleans were effective, but I was very disappointed. They taste good, but didn't satisfy my hunger or my sweet tooth. About the same as eating a piece of dark chocolate. I wound up gaining weight while using these."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Chocoleans didn't curb my appetite at all. In fact, it made me hungrier. Hershey's dark chocolate containing 60% pure cocoa suppressed my food cravings better. Please note that I'm not advertising for Hershey products nor encouraging anyone to do as I did."
1,CHOCOLEANS,Way too expensive for little in return. The same size piece of dark chocolate with the same calorie content would be just as filling. [...]
5,Beyond the best...,"Audacious as this comment may be, reading this books is better than reading the original Shakespeare's Macbeth."
5,A Defense from a Contemporary,"John Taylor of Caroline's "" Defence of the Measures of the Administration of Thomas Jefferson"" is a great political defense of Jefferson's first administration from a friend and a contemporary. Taylor eloquently defends the Judiciary Act of 1801, the the war with the Barbary Pirates, the Louisiana Purchase, and the reduction of the national debt. Taylor brilliantly shows what supporters of Jefferson expected by his election, and got it. Economy in governemnt, reduction of the debt, cutting of government employees and the reform of a tyrannical Fedrealist judiciary. For students of Jefferson and Taylor, a great read."
4,A good collection of opening patterns and how to deal with them,"Bozulich's book provides the mid-kyu-level go player with a collection of early-game problems that can be useful for those who learn by example.This book is not written for the recent beginner of Go. Although there is little discussion on opening theory itself, the problems and their explanations are focused around common opening patterns, and for that reason they are instructive. It may be useful to read this in conjunction with a more theoretical book on the opening such as Janice Kim's ""Learn to play go: The Palace of Memory""."
3,Organizational Performance,This was a text book that I used at UMUC for an Organizational Performance class.I don't remember anything special about it.
3,Not Enough...,"This book is a good starting point for studying/working problems for the Civil 8-hour exam. But--and this is a BIG 'but'--it is NOT ENOUGH material, nor is it really the appropriate level of difficulty for the test. It also doesn't offer enough problems, which is the same criticism I have with Lindeburg's big Reference Manual. These are a good item to have to *complement* other study materials, but don't try to use these alone...not that Lindeburg recommends that anybody do that."
1,did not receive item ordered,"I ordered the shredder pictured however the company callled and said thaye did not have that model and would like to sub one of better performance and quality. I agreeded but am not happy with the sub because it does not handle 14-16 pages but would only handle 9 pages, it does not have auto start, it did not have an internal trash unit. I was told that a trash unit had been shipped separately but I never received it. The only good point was the micro shred. I also would like for my true purchase to be on my invoice for accounting purposes and it is not. If my company asked me where this shredder I put in as an expense I would have the totally wrong description. I cannot review an item I did not receive. The vendor was Ace Depot and I went in to buy another and they continue to be a vendor for that item when they do not have it.the product I received was GBC Glhs9[...], which cost less than I was charged."
4,Shredder,I use this item in a retail store where we sell business services. We just added a shredding service and this machine fits the bill.
3,Good Book for beginners,Covers the fundamentals of JSP. Its very good book for beginners. A little bit coverage of advance topics. Anybody can move to advance level book after completing this.
2,Do-it-yourself Manual,"I have 2 major complaints about this book and the software that comes with it. The first is that setting up Apache's Tomcat is not exactly intuitive, and there is almost no help in the book itself. It casually mentions editing a batch file here and there without any specifics. As far as setting up a JDBC driver, youre pretty much on your own. My other complaint is that some of the code itself is buggy. The author(s) takes a meandering journey throughout this book, as if ideas were just coming to him randomly. The book does little good for a beginner because of its lack of info on getting the software that is bundled with it working properly."
2,Starts out good but code is buggy!,"Hi:THe book looks good and has helped to get me going. The book will go off in directions in a haphazard way that reminds me of a Simpsons episode where Homer is trying to repair his basement by watching a video. The BIG problem with this book is that the code has errors in it that keep it from working!! This to me is a big NO NO and the reason I gave the book a low rating. Sometimes the errors can be fixed by adding an import statement here and there but othertimes it seems to be a question of coding logic. Now I have not time to debug their code so I skip it, but it would be nice to see it work...On top of all that there is NO support for the book by the author or the publisher. This is strange considering other titles offer great suppor that usually rival software manufacturers support for their own product!"
1,Please don't waste your money here!!!,"This book amazed when I first sat down to read it.After encountering the first few errors, I decided to write them all down.- After reaching the 15th error after about 40 pages, it wasjust too much!- The authors don't even provide you with code samples that work!- They don't go into any level of depth when explainingsomething (I know this is a beginners book, but at least don'twrite something that is not true, just because you assume yourreader are not JSP/Java experts).- I wouldn't dare charge more than $10 for such a low-qualitywork."
2,carol jewlery,nice product but does not lay flat on the right side it needs a slip ring to keep the right side facing out
5,May he live on 4 EVER...,"Great c.d a must have, if your a true Michael Jackson fan. Your love this c.d from beging to end, great songs well put together."
3,My review.,"I re-read a lot of the first few chapters because I wasn't grasping what the author was trying to say. Hang in there, though, it all comes together later in the book. By the way, there is probably already a copywrite on it, but a more appropriate title for the book is ""Learning how to think outside of the box""."
4,Writing Essays Couldn't Be Easier!,Thank you for sending the books to me promptly and in excellent condition. My children have no further excuses for not writing their essays for college. They now have all the tools they need. Thank you again.
3,Missing figures 1-3,"When one pays for a reprint the entire original article should be included! It is very disappointing to be reading along and be told that a point is explained by figure 1 only to have figure 1 (as well as figures 2 & 3) ""omitted""."
5,Excellent,This dvd is perfect for the novice or the student.Ms. Hagen has a very engaging style and interacts well with her students. The different scenes are approached and critiqued in helpful ways without a lot of grand-standing or diva attitude. This lady is a professional and treats all with respect.Many comments from famous students like Amanda Peet and Whoopee Goldberg also add to the texture of the workshops.
2,"Too Little, Too Late","This is the book that should have accompanied the software, still leaving the need for a third party book that actually explains what features do what and when, why and how to use them. This book, in instance after instance gives no more information than the program gives, leaving you quite in the dark as how, and whether or not to perform a given activity. I will now buy a third party book on Quicken with the hope of learning everything 'The Official Guide' and the software didn't explain."
2,Left me kinda disapointed,"I had some trouble finding instructions I wanted. I get the impression that this book was taken from the Quicken help files because you can get the same info by choosing Help on the menu in the Quicken program.Maybe its my fault and this book just isn't for me, but I got more out of the other title I bough from Amazon. Not a bad book though."
2,Not Very Helpful,"If you're looking for nuts and bolts help, this is not the book. I'm still searching for how to enter accrued interest on a muni bond.I thought this would be a helpful reference as I migrated from Microsoft Money to Quicken. It's easier to go the trial and error route.I'm beginning to like Quicken. But this book is now serving admirably as a doorstop."
2,Superseded Book,"This book was moderately useful in handling routine issues, but anything advanced, especially technical glitches, were not even mentioned. Superseded by the 2001 version."
4,"A ""How it works"" book, not a ""How to do it"" book.","I was looking for a book that would help me organize my finances using Quicken 2000. If you are looking for a ""How to"" book, this book is not for you. This book simply describes the functions of Quicken 2000 without going into a lot of detail about why, when, or how you should organize your finances.Regardless, this book is well written and is easier to access and read than the online manual."
3,A good read ...,"Advances in medical technology have contributed remarkably to increases in the quality (and quantity) of life experienced by countless millions of people. Delivery of these medical benefits, of course, depends on the competencies, integrity, and morality of the medical profession.What can happen when medical professionals lose their moral and ethical compass and exploit medical advances for financial gain, without regard for personal or professional consequences? Brothers Garden explores this question.The author weaves plausible science, corrupt medical practice, zealous investigators, and romantic entanglements into an absorbing tale that lingers in one's mind long after the last page has been turned."
3,Good but not Great,"Don't get me wrong, this CD does have some incredible music. ""Gotta get back to you"" and ""Latin Sagebrush"" are excellent tracks worth hearing over and over again.Yet, somehow, Wade (the composer for Down to the Bone) has been, in my opinion, de-evolving from a delicious, elegant, almost - unheard Acid Jazz (example: all previous albums and particularly tracks ""The Zodiac"" and ""Mighty Mighty Fine"") to a Fusion-Jazz that already exists in the market for which he is not creating a very particular style.Buy it if you have some other Down to the Bone CD, it is nice to hear a author evolve and not stay in the same groove (as so many do nowadays, taking the easy way out to have a sure selling CD). But if you are new to Down to the Bone, buy the previous albums first."
2,Dubbed in english,"I bought this movie hoping for it to be as good First Option. My only regret is that Michael Wong's character is the only one speaking English. All the other characters are speaking Cantonese. So if you like subtitled movies, this ones for you.I'm not one that likes subtitled movies, I prefer to listen and watch the movie. This is the reason I gave it 2 stars, I was trying to keep up with the subtitles just to follow the flow of the movie.I'm hoping in the future they will release the other movies dubbed too, their are suppose to be around 10 movies."
2,Slips off a lot,"I got this to protect my front passenger seat when I had a dog riding shotgun. Unfortunately, it keeps slipping off and it's not worth the aggravation. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Yummy!,"I purchased this book for my three-year-old while in Nawlins in May 2002. What a joy! My daughter loves pushing the gingerbread boy cutout through each page into each new adventure. Unfortunately, with two young children my opportunities to head to New Orleans again in the near future are slim...My only complaint about this book is that there is no addendum that provides the phonetics for proper Cajun pronunciation."
3,"unfortunately, it's too expensive to read!","I'm doing a wonderful unit on the gingerbread boy with my first graders and this was one of the recommended books. I buy many books from Amazon, but my mouth dropped open at the price of this one. It's not available at our public library either. What a shame, especially after reading the other great reviews!"
5,Excellent,"This is a great product. I take several hundred photos a year, although I don't print them all. I enjoy the convenience of printing them at home as I need them for myself and my family. Sony products are always a favorite of mine."
5,Great item and great service...,This item was shipped super fast. It is a great item. I have not opened it yet but I am sure it will be fine.
5,Sony 4 x 6 Print Pack,"The merchandise was received in good shape and much quicker than I expected it. Also, the price was a few dollars lower than what I would have paid in office supply stores. Since the amount of the purchase exceeded a qualifying price, there was no S/H charges. I am a ""happy camper"" at this time with Amazon."
2,Confused Buyers,I bougth this print pack assuming that it will work on my ex50. It's out of stock last year and this was the one put on the site instead. I still had this opened package which I found out would not work on my printer. I wish amazon would make it clearer to buyers so that we can order the right print pack and dont get confused. I'm really dissatisfied with this purchase.JJB
1,Review,This was the wrong item for my machine. I did receive a full refund. This item was linked to my product in error on the Amazon website.
3,picture printing,i would give a better review but i haven't used it yet. i THOUGHT i ordered 2 of the 120 print packages but i got those & 2 (24) packs. this makes at least two orders from amazon that turned out wrong. i'll keep trying though. they have more of what i want.
5,Sharon's Purchase,"I've bought the 4 X 6 printer paper and ink cartridges in the past and they work well in my Sony picture printer. The price was reasonable and package was sent & received in a short time, in spite of Christmas mail. No complaints--I'll buy this product again in the future, and very likely from the same merchant."
1,Misleading information,"When a search is done on Amazon for the Sony DPP-ex50, this paper comes up as the product for this printer, IT IS NOT CORRECT. If you purchase this, you will be out almost 50 bucks for paper that is NOT FOR THE SONY DPP-ex50. If you open or not return right away, you get nothing. THIS IS THE LAST TIME I ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR. MISLEADING MISLEADING MISLEADING."
1,wrong paper for obsolete printer,Review said it was for a certain printer model but it wasn't.It was supposed to work with an obsolete Sony picture printer.
1,"Use Google, save your money !","I bought this for my kids but even I cannot get any information out of it. Though it has everything but it is poorly organized and makes getting answers painfulFor example, my son wanted to know numbers of states in India. After wasting 4 hours I could not find any place where states are listed. Finally I turned to Google and got the answers. Another example - he wanted to find towns on Mississipi River. We went crazy to get names. In the end we picked old Atlas and got the names."
1,Very difficult and often impossible to install,"Tried installing on two ( 2 ) excellent PC's running Windows 98 with no success other than ruining one hard disc drive - Britannica website support was POOR and troubleshooting section was no help - Major problem appears to be a goofy Java loader called ""InstallAnywhere"" that locks up your machine and often destroys CLOGS UP your HDD with junk that can't be removed by any of the procedures Britannicas POOR instructions - Hope that Britannica can stop using goofy and buggy zerog.com software so they can provide a good product that actually works ! ??"
3,Dubious Marketing,"While Eriugena's work is of significance and importance, I find that marketing this as Celtic Spirituality is somewhat deceptive. Eriugena lived and worked in France and his relationship to ""Celtic"" thought and spirituality is nowhere as strong as the influence of Greek Neoplatonism. 5 stars for Eriugena, none for Branford, hence 2.5, which can be rounded up to 3."
5,Tower Genealogy,"I have read this book and would like to own it. I am a descendant of John Tower and searching for information I ran across this book in the library. It was so informative and told me things I never knew. My descendancy is from Clarinda (6), Gideon (5), John (4), Benjamin (3), John (2), John (1). Clarinda married Benjamin Lareu. Of course the spelling of Lareu changed with generations. Their son William is my great-great-grandfather. So you see I find that the information Ms. Tower included in her book helped me trace so much. For anyone tracing the Tower family this is the book to read."
3,"Don't get me wrong, I like the mattress","I like the built in pump feature, just be sure you don't break off the locking snap for the battery compartment holder as it saves you having to hold the battery case while it inflates. I like the feel of it sleeping, very firm and a nice texture, the sleeping side is a velour-like material that is not slippery. The only problem is that they do puncture, the first one after I gave it some medium rough treatment on a concrete floor, the second due to a rip, plain and simple and not caused by anything I did but sleep on it, which the little adhesive things they include for puncture repair were not up to the job for fixing it. I hope to get my third mattress. I have to wait for them to send me a card, after I called them, to fill out, to (presumably) send to them along with the now defunct mattress so they will (hopefully) send me a replacement."
1,It leaked the first time I used it!,"I bought it for my yellowstone trip. It started leaking even before I slept on it! In the morning I ended up with sleeping on the ground! The second day I carefully followed every step in the instruction, again slept on the ground. Keep away from this trash."
2,not worth the price,When I first got this I thought it was great. Very convenient to have the built in pump. Very comfortable and easy to use. But it only lasted 6 months before it split at one of the dimples and was unpatchable. I won't buy another.
1,Pretty Bad Air Mattress,"I usually write good reviews. But this thing isn't very good. Not comfortable, the pump included cannot be plugged into the wall (good luck with all those 4-D batteries you'll need), and doesn't do a good job anyway.Rather sleep on the floor. Seriously."
2,"No ""nylon carry bag with shoulder straps""","""It includes a nylon carry bag with shoulder straps"" Well this is a lie. It does not come with any bag. They said it was a mistake when I called. I kinda wanted to store it in it's on bag. Guess I will have to pay more to buy a bag it will fit in.Other then that, its a bed you fill with air."
1,YOU NEED A HEARING AIDE,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!! I contacted uniden about the volume on this phone, they suggested plugging it into the jack directly with nothing else attached (answering machine) etc. I did this and problem still exists with not being able to hear the other person very well Im so frustrated with having to ask people to repeat themselves. Uniden said they would take a look at the phone but would only replace if necessary and even then it would be a refurbished unit! I bought this brand new only months ago, I say this is TERRIBLE customer resolutions .... I only paid about $20 so as the saying goes you get what you pay for. Im going to return these or throw them in the trash and get anything but UNIDEN!"
5,VOL. 3 IS TIGHT,"I enjoyed only a few songs at first, but after listening to it a few times, I love the whole cd. I would've liked to hear a little more from DMX but thats alright :) Forget that review that said that his song was bad, you listen to it for yourself that song is tight. That man has a way w/ words. Also another favorite is Eve's YOU ME & SHE. CD definitely worth the money. Thanks."
3,It's Okay,"This is argubaly the worst Ruff Ryder Compilation but it's not like its terrible. The best song is ""Gonna Be Sumthin"" and U,Me and She."
3,In the 'R' We Trust,"With the arrival of the Third installment of the Ruff Ryders Compilation, any fan of the Ruff Ryders camp can breathe a huge sigh of relief. It has been a minute since we last heard from the Ruff Ryders and it is good to hear the familiar thunderous beats from producers Swizz Beats and P. K. Not only is this a family reunion of sorts with the whole crew on appearing on at least one track (DMX, EVE, the LOX, Drag-On, Parlee, Yung-Wun)everyone comes through in that familiar grimy DOUBLE R fashion. It also features a few newcomers such as Infa-Red and Cross who prove the future of the Ruff Ryders clique is as bright as ever, though they are from DMXs Bloodline Records. But this is not just a family affair, Timbaland brings his BEAT CLUB on the hot joint entitled ""They Aint Ready"" in which Jadakiss and Tims protege Bubba Sparxxx spit nothing but hot bars. Ludacris also drops a gem of a verse on the crunked up track ""Some South S**t!"" ...."
3,Was gunna buy.,"I was lookin foward to buying the new ruff rydaz Cd but afta hearing one the other reviews saying that there aint much drag-on or the lox, or swizz beatz producing most of the tracks i kinda change my mind. I'll have to hear it from a friend 1st. beacuse i bought the other 2 complimation CD's manly for the swizz beat tracks with the lox and expecially DRAG-ON. I would like to hear anothe down bottom style hype song with a big feature in it like juve. I rated this Cd 3 stars since i havent heard it. once i hear it i'll let u kno what i thought. Well i'll check it out lata."
2,What happened?,"after listening to ruff ryders volume 1 & 2 , you would expect this album to be incredible, however this album is'nt worth the money you pay for it. volume 1 & 2 were so good because it was mostly LOX, Drag-On, cross, and infa red. the first 2 albums were mostly produced by swizz beatz,while the third album had 2 or 3 songs produced by him. this album is produced for clubs and cars rather than the gangsta rap fan. I only gave this album any stars because of the solo Drag-On song ""we don't give a f*ck"".Drag-On & LOX have not been spoiled by success and money like DMX and eve have. Another HUGE disapointment was the DMX solo song. Now the last 2 albums had a DMX solo song towards the end of the album and it was the best song on the album. This album however has another producer making the beat for DMX's song which makes it boring and repetitive. DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM! JUST DOWNLOAD ""WE DON'T GIVE A F*CK"" BY DRAG-ON AND LISTEN TO THAT SONG!"
4,Another Double R Album Drops,"This album is ok compared to the likes of Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, i thought they really slipped on this album, the beats didnt match the lyrics an the songs just didnt sound right. I liked the Put it in your hole skit, it was funny. Well if you like the Ruff Ryders get this album. Its not a must by but its better then most out there. Much luv..."
4,Something to Keep the Competing Angler's Feet on the Ground.,"I have read, and re-read this book about 4 times. Each new season coming off a bad previous tournament season, I re-read it and find it to be a grounding factor in my goal setting for the coming year. I feel like I know Joe personally at this point. His insight into what really happens in Competitive Fishing is exceptional, and details the real world responsibilities of what it takes to be a National Touring Bass Pro. The financial part of it may be a little outdated, because the sport and payouts of Full Time Tournament Fishing have increased greatly since 1996, but the content and mental aspects of this book make it one that needs to be in any serious bass tournament anglers library."
5,"IF YOU ARE AN AVID ANGLER, CHECK THIS BOOK OUT!",This book is awesome! It explains in biographic form the ups and downs of being on the tournament trail...even a section telling how hard it is to maintain sponsars and the business side of bass fishing. I was real startled to here that he found a suicide victims body in the water.
1,"Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad! Did I mention bad?","The acting is bad, the writing is bad, the directing is bad! Basically everything about this movie is bad!When they were in the armored vehicle being shot at, why didn't they just close the door?The hailstones would have easily crushed through the cover they were hiding under.Why did those two guys just leave the motorcycles out running while they went to the johns?The girl is shot, yet she manages to make it to the cross, and then manages to climb all of those stairs to the top. Yeah right!There are so many holes in this movie!"
4,Modern Psychedelic Classic!,"Soundtrack of Our Lives is the next best rock group that Sweden have ever produced(Union Carbide Productions i of course the best). This album is their incredible debut that was released in 96 to a largely indifferent world(exept in Sweden) Their influences ranges from Stooges, Love, early Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones and every other good rock group in history. Why not five stars? Well it is a bit to long(about 70 minutes) and some songs are a bit unfocused."
2,"Once over lightly, not well written","I finally got a copy of this after being impressed by the table of contents and previous reviews. Ignore them. This book's coverage of Lingo and interactive development barely makes it past 'go to the frame'. Rollovers are covered in excruciating detail as if they're the be all and end all of multimedia development.There are horrible proofreading mistakes. Have you got a 'graphic Excelerator' in your computer? Apparently it's good to have one if you're running Director!There are clear signs that this was a rush job. In the (only) chapter on Lingo, almost the first bit of code you see in a screenshot wouldn't even compile - they've run two lines of code together.All up, *not* recommended, and I certainly won't be setting this as a reading for my students."
4,Its is great,I'd read this book over and over with out getting tired this story is made to teenage girls it has love!!! and mystery!!!and action!!! and sadness! hapinees! loved it soooooooooo much the only book i read that is better than this is HARRY POTTER SERIES LOVE BOTH OF THEM!!!
1,Absolute garbage,Nothing but lies. What give a Canadian the right to go and live on a Palestinian land? It shows nothing but deleberate twist of the truth. She made the Arab look like a bunch of uncivilized tribes because they are fighting invaders. She gave herself the right to go and live on a land owned by Palestinians and she wants the Palestinian to welcome her with open arms. This is the kind of propaganda that is targeting young children that have no knowledge of what the real story is. School districts that put this kind of trash on their reading list are irresponsible and should immediately remove such readings.
4,3 rich voices that know how to give life to broadway tunes,"You don't need to see this musical to appreciate these Jerry Herman broadway classics. Leslie Uggams, Carol Channing and Andrea McArdle all have unique qualities to their voices which make their renditions both exciting and entertaining. I saw the show only once, but I've listened to the music hundreds of times. I always find the songs humorous and touching... they always uplift me. Buy this CD!"
3,Vought,I have been purchasing airplane models to build from Amazon for some time. The results have been very good. They arrive when promised and in good condition.
2,What has happened to music these days,"This is horrible, get the older warped tour DVD in, i beleive, 96 or 97. The music on this tour absolutley sucked. Whiney, my girlfriend brock-up with me, look i have a tattoo of a sparrow, and i don't comb my hair or wash it but die it black, music. This music just made me hate whats coming out these days. If you want to see a show/music that will stimulate your little minds. Go buy Social D, Jawbreaker, Rites of Spring, Husker Du, Minor Threat, Cursive, Jets to Brazil, Bad Brains, Embrace, Modest Mouse. Please go out and get any of these bands and explore good meaningful music.P.S. How is more Foolish? The fool or the fool who follows?"
2,Whats with this??,"The warped tour has turned into crap. whats with NoFX and Anti-Flag dissin on USA for? they dont like it then take your sucky music over to canada or sumthin, we wont miss you. i only gave it 2 stars cuz the used it increbible if they werent on here it would get 0 stars. warped tour sucks now it has new found glory? i wish nofx and anti-flag would leave they suck. like the other dude said about the upside down flags if thats on ur guitar then that is pathetic. any of yall anti-flag followers wonna say sumthin about this then e-mail me if u wish: homefry3007@yahoo.com"
4,Not quite 5 stars,"If you like the Warped Tour this DVD is a must have. The qaulity is excellent, and the sound is great. I also liked all the behind the the scenes footage, the interviews, and one band showed what life is like on a tour bus, I thought that was pretty cool. I gave the DVD 4 stars because bands like Lagwagon, NOFX, and No Use For a Name only got 1 video and it seemed like every other band got 2. I don't think it's fair that a band like Something Corporate should get 2 videos and great bands that have been around for a while, like the 3 I mentioned before only got 1. I also thought they could have added in a few more bands. There are a couple from the tour that I liked that weren't on the DVD. Other than those 2 things I'd say this DVD is well above average and is definatly worth the money."
5,Warped rocks my socks,"In my opinion warped tour is the greatest tour to ever have happened. I've gone for 7 years now and every year it just gets better. This DVD does a good job showcasing the energy and the vibe that goes on at these shows. With live performances, interviews and the extreme sports this is a must have for anyone who has or wants to go to a Warped Tour ever. It's simply amazing, I'm going to watch it every day.New Found Glory, The Used and Mxpx all have live performances on here, as well as many other bands. Check it out."
3,Good But Not Great,"I would rate this DVD as average. I should note that I am not a huge fan of most of the bands on this DVD. The format is good. There is commentary from each band & live performances. The Alkaline Trio performance is phenomenal as well as Bad Religion. New Found Glory, Reel Big Fish, NOFX, Flogging Molly, The Used, & Something Corporate are worth watching but not great on the DVD. I also own the Warped Tour 2003 DVD which I found to be much better."
3,Good but,"Its good, but its missing bands. Where's Good Charlotte, Sum 41, and AFI? They were all on Warped 02..."
2,What has happened to music these days,"This is horrible, get the older warped tour DVD in, i beleive, 96 or 97. The music on this tour absolutley sucked. Whiney, my girlfriend brock-up with me, look i have a tattoo of a sparrow, and i don't comb my hair or wash it but die it black, music. This music just made me hate whats coming out these days. If you want to see a show/music that will stimulate your little minds. Go buy Social D, Jawbreaker, Rites of Spring, Husker Du, Minor Threat, Cursive, Jets to Brazil, Bad Brains, Embrace, Modest Mouse. Please go out and get any of these bands and explore good meaningful music."
1,Predictable Lightweight Horror 'Romance',"I can't believe the glowing reviews of this book. Despite being 241 pages long, half of this page count are blank pages at chapter ends with a typeface so large as to almost seem like a childrens book. I read the whole book while waiting for a flight at Warsaw airport. The writers style was so lightweight and the plot so predictable (it was obvious the female central character would kill the rapist and her father in her werewolf guise). Also at times it felt like I was reading a cheap dime store housewifes romance novel in the descriptions of the love affair between Jenny and Kurt (and God how cheesy are these character names). Not enough real horror or dark descriptive narrative for my liking. As an avid reader of werewolf novels, I would recommend avoiding this. Appalling."
1,A poor novel and a truly disappointing werewolf story.,From the first few pages I knew I had made a mistake purchasing this book. It is formulaic light horror romance of the worst kind. The plot as well as the characters are predictable and ultimately forgettable with a juvenile interpretation of the werewolf archetype.
1,disappointing,"I bought this as a project for my daughter and I to do together. It said it came with instructions inside the box but it didn't. I had to guess how to mix and dry the cement. The photo shows a ""tin"" mold but it was a flimsy plastic that dented and cracked during shipping. I was not sure how to dry the concrete so I put it outside in the sun. Obviously, that was wrong because it cracked in half. It was a junky kit."
1,Deceptive,"While this is the book that has the information, If you want to get at it on the CD you have to pay $195.00. Just a little detail that was not mentioned anywhere until I purchased the book tried to install it."
4,WON'T WORK ON THE NEWER PS2 SYSTEMS!!,"I want to ditto what a couple people have written, previously: this blue glow stand will NOT work on the newer PS2 gaming consoles. If you have an older version (purchased before 2007) it will work fine, but the newer versions don't have a screw-hole in the side of the unit and the power supply (AC Adaptor) is different. PLEASE be aware of this before you purchase a glow stand for your newer PlayStation!!!"
1,No Lights,the stand worked great but when i plugged it in and started it up it did not glow as promised. such a dissappointment
1,NOTE**NOT FOR SLIM PS2,"Even though the product (original packaging-not the website picture) has a slim ps2 pictured on it, it is just a ploy to make it look smaller. Plus, the title is misleading, which is my fault for not taking the time to look at it more closely. Long story short, if you have a slim ps2, purchase some duct tape along with this product which is the only way it will stay upright."
5,Vertical Glow Stand,the vertical glow stand looks great! gives the playstation 2 a different look and saves on space! easy to install! installs in minutes.
4,not to bad woth the money,it was a very cool stand for the slim ps2 it makes a good night light for game rooms or any other room it makes gaming fun... enjoy i say its woth 15$ you should get it if you want a neat stand!!!...
5,Great,"Great addition to your library if you are interested in the Napoleonic era. Shows how units were raised, used and abused, but fought for a cause."
4,great for toddlers..cannot find in stores,"I like simple movies for the little ones, too much digital animation can take away from the story. You can't find these christian movies in any stores, especially for the low price."
2,Very disappointed! You get what you pay for on this collection!,"Each story is okay, BUT...they DO NOT follow the Bible word for word! The covers to each and every DVD is deceiving! The animation on the cover of each DVD in this 15 disc series are wonderful! BUT...the problem is... The actual DVD animated movie is very, very, very generic!!! Absolutely the lowest quality, and the graphics are horrible. The cover pictures ARE NOT what you get in the movie itself!! Not even close! As a consumer, I expect to get what is advertised!! I was wondering why there weren't any video sample clips... Now I know!! It is too bad that I opened them all before I watched one because I would have returned them all!! Not Kidding! Instead...I will donate them and stick to the ""What's In The Bible, with Buck Denver"" DVD Collection! It may have been a huge investment, but to me...it's well worth it! It also follows the Bible word for word! [...]"
3,nismo plate,"Ive had the license frame for about 3 weeks now and i love it but the ""I"" came off. The shipping was fast and the product had no missing pieces. But they need to do something about the lettering."
3,Chrome is Good but letters fell off,The stainless part looks great but nismo letters started fading in a few months and have now completely fallen off. Seems the plastic letters were glued to the frame
3,Was a great product until....,"I was very excited when I purchased this product as one of my brithday presents for my boyfriend, but after a week he had installed it in his truck, the ""I"" in Nismo came off. He loves his truck and treats it very gently and always mantains it clean, so it wasn't mishandled at all. Now, we have to cut out some black tape and size it to fit the ""I"" so you can still read it. The shipment was quick and it looked great until one of the letters came off."
4,good except for plastic gears that wear,"Have been happy with this product for two years, but plastic gears wear out and you can't find replacement parts anywhere which bothers me more with the waste than the expense of replacing the entire thing over a tiny little gear. Also, ice part is pretty useless as it does reduce pores and make it more painful."
4,Liked it,"I don't know if price was best out there, but received in brand new condition... out of date now... got bogged down in projects and never used book, oh well."
5,The greatest cookbook ever!,"I am a cooking enthusiast, and have a very extensive collection of cookbooks. This book has been my absolute favorite for over a decade. This is the most useful cookbook I have ever owned. The number of recipies is incredible, and include plenty to keep the novice cook or professional level chef busy. Craig Claiborne is extremely reliable in providing recipies that work perfectly. Unusual ingredients are rarely required. There are many very unique recipies I have never seen variations of anywhere else that taste absolutely heavenly. Many different nationalities are covered. This cookbook is pure gold, and is the greatest cookbook ever written. This is far and above the most valuable cookbook in my collection."
2,International - barely!,"The term 'International' is used extremely loosely here. I may be being picky but when I buy a cookbook touting being 'International' I expect it to have a a decent amount of recipes from each country included - not a MASSIVE section of French food but when you get to numerous other countries you're lucky to get 2 to 4 recipes for them. And, when you buy an 'International' cookbook shouldn't the recipes actually be authentic? For example: I am pretty sure very few Russians can afford to use a pound of Fillet Mignon to make Beef Stroganoff.Furthermore, a great many of the recipes - you will NEVER use. Seriously - who needs this many recipes for Fish Soup? Do people really eat Fish Soup EVER????Yes, there are several recipes that are excellent but you may be searching a while for them amongst the useless ones."
2,Agree with Cilla,"Like Cilla, I did not agree with the use of alcohol by the characters in the second story of this book. Otherwise, the story would have been really good and I would have given it a higher rating."
5,A CLASSIC TALE,"The plot will be familiar to anyone who has seen the old silent movie ""Thief of Bagdad."" This is a Middle Eastern tale of three princes who search the world for rare treasures in order to win the hand of a princess. Will true love triumph? Wonderful telling of a classic story."
5,Usually Hard to Find...but its Easy here....,My Dad absolutely loves Canoe and we cant find it anywhere in NY. Quick Amazaon search...and here it is.So easy to buy and it was exactly what he wanted...could not have been easier.
5,Unlike anything that I have ever heard before,"Dropkick Murphys play an amazing combination of loud hard angry music with bagpipes thrown in for good measure. :)I realize that I am most likely much older than their normal fan base. So that goes to show you that they can appeal to all ages. You don't have to be a kid to like this band. You just have to have a rebellious streak, like I do, at times. It definitely comes out when I watch or listen to this band. They are loud and fun.The St. Patrick's day concert alone is worth the purchase of this dvd. Buy this dvd. You may be pleasantly surprised, like I was the first time that I heard this band. :)"
5,Best gymnastics wrist guards,I got these in pink a long time ago and have loved them ever since. I don't even use the hard plastic pieces but they are still nice and firm. I use them for tumbling and I love them. They keep your wrists from hurting after things like back handsprings. I definitely recommend these.
4,Wonderful read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Song Quest was a wonderful read. I found that it got off to a quite slow beginning but picked up the pace. There was one more thing I didn't like about it. Each side had almost super power. Besides those two things I really enjoyed the book. You should read this book for it is a great book to read while waiting for the next Harry Potter.
3,Just like the starts indicate.... it's okay,"I was expecting a lot from this video, especially since the reviews for it are great. To me, this was very beginner level, and far too short. Plus, since it is older the camera work and resolution are terrible. Not that it matters a ton, but it is pretty amateur-ish. I will use this video on days I don't feel like doing very much."
4,Good beginner DVD-cheap enough to give to all your friends who want to try yoga,"It's not a fancy video, but it is a good one. It is a short review of basic yoga poses. This video is most helpful for those just starting out in their practice. The only thing in the video is all of the shirtless pasty men in the video, but quality of the instruction makes up for it."
4,"Shows some basic poses, but isn't really a workout","This is a nice presentation of some of the basic poses, and it's not very expensive. But it doesn't really amount to a workout. So if you want to review some basic poses at home once in a while, this DVD is fine for that. But this isn't really something to get if you want to follow along for a home yoga class on a regular basis."
3,Too disjointed,"I love Baron and I should preface this review by saying I have considerable Power Yoga experience, though I'm far from expert. I also have to work within some physical limitations.That said, I found this video far too slow and disjointed and, as one reviewer said, too easy even for beginners. It had no flow like you expect in vinyasa yoga.I would say that if you need to learn the very basic poses this would be a good video. But if you want a short practice that flows, this is not a good video for you.I would suggest a Bryan Kest video or most any other Baron Baptiste videos. But just not this one.I enjoy short practices and Rodney Yee, Bryan Kest and even Baron have some very good ones. I would pass on this unless you are a real novice and need to understand the basic poses."
5,Great Vinyasa Yoga Video,This video is great for the beginners and the advanced beginners. I started taking a Vinyasa class and was unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so I looked for a video to supplement my practice at home. What a great choice. Baron Baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home. I highly recommend this DVD.
1,Slow not true to vinyasa flow,I found his form of vinyasa not very flowy slow and boring. If you want something more true to Vinyasa this is not the video.
5,Summary of Plot,"In his videotaped will, oil tycoon Virgil Hadley, 75, challenges his eight heirs to a bizarre competition; they must complete four increasingly difficult assignments in order to inheit. Greed, murder, missing persons, family secrets, revenge and infanticide figure prominently in this debut whodunit, set in 1995 Colorado. The heroine, Quinn Farley, 29, is lured into playing the game, which threatens her relationship with fiance Police Lt. Tig Grogan, assigned to investigate Virgil's death. Only Quinn's wits and unorthodox stratagems unravel the puzzles."
4,EXCELLENT MOVIE,"THIS MOVIE IS A WONDERFUL COMBINATION OF DRAMA, SUPERNATURAL, DEATH + ROMANCE. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN UNDER STRESS FALLS FOR A MAN WHO IS A TERRIBLE PERSON. SHE FINDS HIM IN BED WITH A PROSTITUTE, IS PUSHED TO HER DEATH, THEN RETURNS AS A GHOST. A VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE"
1,The worst book about singing out there,"I have read so many books about singing, you would think I'm crazy.This was the worst one, because it doesn't tell you anything. It just keeps saying how wonderfull her method is, so if you want come fly over please!"
1,What do you expect?,"Your satisfaction will depend entirely on your expectations. If you are looking for an instructional, - or a ""how-to"" book to achieve a new method of singing. This book is NOT it. If you just want to read about the author's life experiences in regard to her career in music, her personal journeys, her discovery of a new vocal technique and how she came to have a school of music - read on. The entire book digresses from myths about singing, to helpful herbs, to singing with emotion for self-expression.....and is an overall transcript of her personal perspectives. Humor is attempted throughout, compounding an already confusing and nebulous script. Although not without some validity - this book does not provide any actual instruction to incorporate into your daily practice to achieve the results she advertises."
4,A surreal tale of the ending of a marriage and the beginning of a life...,"Paul Toth's FISHNET is a heartbreakingly honest book about one man's failure to live up to the dream self he, his wife, and his town, have created for him and his wife's failure to live up to her own potential. They are ghosts who haunt one another's lives. But on the eve of disaster for the small town they live in, their own lives and marriage crumbling beneath them, this husband and wife have a chance to save themselves, and their marriage, if they can build a bridge across the great ocean that has grown up between them.A novel of magic and heartache, Mr. Toth creates characters you feel, a story you see, and a world you believe. At once tragic and redemptive, this is a tale of love in all its beautiful ugliness, and the people who worship at its altar.A fantastic read with characters who really speak to you from a place of honesty, I highly recommend this book."
5,The MAIN Main Ingredient,"Simply the best album this band ever did. Every song is a winner, so it is strange to find so few of it's tracks on the hits/best of compilations. Buy it and die happy."
4,Don't let the title fool you!,"Don't let the title of this video fool you! It does not only include the story of the Lion's Den but takes Daniel from the time of his captivity and includes many stories from his life and the Book of Daniel. Nebuchadnezzar's dream, the writing on the wall, etc.This video was very helpful in illustrating the study of the book of Daniel for my Sunday School class. Even though it is animated, some scenes may be somewhat scarey for very small children (preschool) but it is an accurate depiction of the Bible."
4,Awesome Story!,"This is something the kids love to watch over and over. The story is quite captivating, not slow or fast, just great! The values taught in it are what makes it worth purchasing!!"
4,Great for younger kids!,"This movie is certainly cheesy to the mind of the adult, but to the child ages 1yr to 4yrs, it is a great and entertaining film! The story is quite accurate with very little reference to Charleston Heston, whose name merely helps to ""sell"" the film. A decent movie for bible-conscious parents. =-)"
3,Not too painful,"The animation and story are not bad, but the kids who pops in from time to time to sing a goofy song takes away from at least my family's enjoyment. For the pirce it's not bad..."
3,Watch it on netflix,I was looking to be inspired like when I watched the story of Joseph. This movie was ok. It told the story and I guess as a story it never really reached a climax because Daniel was never really fearful or doubtful. I would just watch it on Netflix.
4,Okay movie,"It is a good movie for children, but it's a little boring. Some children that are use to all the Disney's movies might not be able to sit through this. Also the artworks and music is not good. Recommend this movie for 5th graders and up."
3,Go with Earth vs. The Wildhearts,Doesn't hold a candle to Earth vs. the Wildhearts. Similar in style and content but there is something missing. Can't put my finger on it. These guys still don't know when to end a song. Sometimes when they span several different styles in a song it's a bit too schizophrenic. And what's up with the second song?
3,Simple and Straightforward but...,"The content of this book relates much to North Vietnam. Some of the vocabulary are outdated (read: ancient) in the modern parts of Vietnam, for e.g., Ho Chi Minh City. Any information about Vietnam learnt from this book must be taken with a pinch of salt. Vietnam is a long country... and local cultures vary somewhat. It'll depend on your teacher to make lessons interesting and relevant, especially if you are to travel to a specific area of Vietnam."
2,BETTER TEXT OUT THERE,"I used this book for my first year Vietnamese class. While the dialouges are good and some passages toward the end are funny, the book as a whole does not teach the basic pronunciations, alphabet, colors...basics for any language. There are better books out there such as Binh Ngo's text. Stay away from this one!"
5,Great for Teaching,I teach school in L.A. and this is a great video to make the students think and ask questions. You can show the entire video at once or just show sections at a time. The video is Awsome but make sure you watch it before lunch. Some of the video might be difficult for people with weak stomachs.dj
4,Informative,This was a very interesting video. Some of the footage was amazing. I loaned it to a friend who watched it over and over. I had to wait some time to get it back! Good work!
2,Wonderful images but not very scientific,"I was shocked to find National Geographic - Inside the Living Body was not very scientific. Many statements were misleading. I did not find it to be at a level acceptable to show to an undergraduate class. However, the film contained many wonderful images."
3,Not the resource I imagined...,"The photography in this video is worth the price; and it is a wonderful video to watch with your children to stimulate conversation.It is not the resource I imagined - National Geographic quality, searchable video book on the human body.It is done in ""chapters,"" so, after you watch the whole thing, you can go to the chapter you want and watch that over and over.For me, it was enjoyable to watch once, and I will send it to my son for my grandchildren to watch.Love NG and Amazon,Granny"
2,what was she thinking???,"After the excellent Guitar Passion, why would Charo go back to disco? This is such a disappointing CD. I'll give it a little credit for camp value, but she is capable of so much more, as her previous album proves. Gusto just sounds thrown together. Let's hope for a better effort next time."
2,Disappointing,"I always liked Tim Middleton's columns that he wrote for CNBC, but this book was disappointing. Not to mention he spells Ben Bernanke's last name as Barnanke for some reason. I learned virtually nothing from this book, in no way do I have a better understanding of bonds or any usable strategies after reading this book."
5,Everybody Loves Raymond - Season 8,One of the greatest television series of all time. I love owning this series.
2,Lost in Translation,"There are two kinds of people in this world, those that absolutely loved the film Lost in Translation and those that said, `What the hell did I just watch?' I myself fall into the latter camp and I couldn't help thinking about that movie while reading this book from Bart Giamatti. It sounds like something that was indeed written by the president of Yale and if it was about baseball I could barely tell. I'm sure there are those that will thoroughly enjoy this work just as those that enjoyed Lost in Translation but clearly this ode to sport was out of my league. I had more fun dissecting John Dryden in a 17th century lit class years ago than I did reading this. I would recommend Thomas Boswell's ""Why Time Begins on Opening Day"" or Ken Burns baseball documentary instead. I have to say the foreword and afterword by Jon Meacham and Marcus Giamatti respectively were very well written and quite moving, more of what I was expecting from the late Commissioner."
5,Silver is Golden!,"Steve Silver's book is a stunning display of artwork from a master of cartooning. A must-have for any serious student of animation, character design, and caricature. I myself have written a book ""Let's Toon CARICATURES"" that is available on Amazon, and I have to say that Steve Silver is one of my biggest modern day influences and inspirations. Buy this book, and be prepared to draw. You WILL be inspired!"
2,"Good book, bad qual","This book is really awesome, it's filled with some great characters and writings by Stephen Silver. The order took longer than expected to ship and had stains and a lot of wear on the binding. I'm glad it is an awesome book so I've kept it, but I was really let down by the quality when it said it was in good condition. This purchase has made me second guess buying used copies. It def was not in good condition or worth the money."
5,Puros Corridos Perrones,"If you like narco corridos you should get this cd, it is the best of all the narco corridos. Especially ""La Fiesta de los Perrones."" Don Mario Almada also contributed to this cd, he talks in some of the corridos. It is a great cd. Compralo hoy mismo."
1,Pass,"The mitts are..., but the construction quality is poor, the stitching started to undo itself. Also, cannot hold something that is hot for a long time, heat travels through the layers in the mitts to your hands."
3,Protective but cumbersome,"I bought these for my wife since she was tired of getting burned when using the ""pretty"" mitts that don't protect very well. The gloves are very effective at preventing burns, but are rather cumbersome for a smaller hand. My wife has an average size woman's hand, and at that has well over an inch of glove at the tips of her fingers. This makes it cumbersome when trying to grab items like cookie sheets from the oven. You don't burn yourself, but you may risk dropping the cookie sheet."
2,Some Keys Don't Work,"My keyboard arrived today. I bought it for the compact size and the illuminated design. Out of the box, the Y, J and F work intermittently. The Macro keys are cool - they work fine. I will contact Cyberguys about returning this one and hopefully the replacement will work better."
2,The mouse is great but thats about it...,"The mouse is great, perfect size, very responsive and easy to use.The keyboard is basically a piece of crap. Out of the box the keys were louder then an Apple IIe. The space bar jams frequently and the keys all wiggle, I want my money back.The keyboard is quite attractive but it ends there. The only reason I rated this product more then a one is because of the steller mouse (which I'm hoping will hold up)"
1,Poor Quality,"Yes, these are the same OEM Nissan license plate frames you can purchase from your Nissan dealer. That being said, I expected much better quality. First, out of the box, the chrome on the license plate frames was slightly pitted. Second, I went through two sets of these in two weeks. The black insert letters fell off all four license plate frames. Not what I expected!"
2,Great For The Casual Fan.,"Great for the casual fan, or older kids. The DVD actually collects 4 episodes of Batman The Animated Series, and is not 2 features as described. If you already have the season sets this offers nothing new."
2,[ ],"What are they doing? This fantastic cartoon, along with Batman the Animated Tales deserves it's own box set. The amount of work that went into this show created an allegiance of fans, all of who are desperate to get their hands on season sets rather than single episodes.They did it for Transformers, why can't they do it for Batman?Please release a box set Warner Bros. You know you can, and you know we want it. So hurry up!I refuse to buy this unless I am sure that this is the only D.V.D format that it will be released in. I am assuming that I am not the only one."
3,AT&T 1305 Answering Machine,I could wish this machine was as simple to operate as the machine it replaces. The 1301. Too many buttons---Don't like the fact that the thing blinks it red light whether it has a message or not.
1,Junk pass on it.,Bought 2 of these BRAND NEW and they are complete junk. Won't disconnect when phone is hooked up directly to the machine. sound quality is a 1. instructions are incomplete though I was able to figure it out. Save your money and buy and qualtiy used one.
4,"Excellent thriller, suspense film",Good old fashion suspense thriller. Keeps you glued to the tube until the very end.
4,I love Mia Farrow.,"This movie with Mia starring as a blind woman in London, she wakes up to find her whole family has been slaughtered in her home. But, who did it? A great suspense."
5,This movie oozes suspense,Excellent film. People forget what it was like to see a good mystery/thriller without a lot of CG and bad acting--here is one! The tension is palpable with Mia Farrow's exemplary performance. You can feel her fear.
3,See no evil is not really worth seeing,"It may have been scary back in 1971, but this slow paced thriller gave me a bit of a yawn and I needed to reach for the fast forward button to get to the good bits. This film reminds me of another english thriller called FEAR which is about a baby sitter.Mia Farrow is convincing as a blind woman who returns to a house where her auntie and uncle have been murdered, but she does not realise straight away. THe killer returns to collect an item he left behind and she must fend for her life.Has been done better in alot of other films. You could easily give this a miss."
1,Don't Buy It,"We watched this last night. My partner wanted to stop after 30 minutes. I kept watching hoping the main character's wife would shake some sense into him. This movie sheds little light on insomnia but a lot of light on the filmmaker - he is VERY proud of himself. I found his constant assertion that he is different and brilliant annoying and not born out by the evidence: lots of people have trouble sleeping and/or are night owls and he clearly isn't brilliant. Most troubling is that he refuses, throughout the film, to do ANYTHING to try to sleep better. That left us with this question: how bad can it be if he doesn't care to change the status quo, for himself, his wife or his new baby?"
4,Review,I give this book a 4 mostly because this wasnt what I was looking for in the book. If you are interested in hieroglypics and language this book was for you. The language seems so complicated I havent even tried to do this yet.
5,ancient poetry with beautiful illustrations,"This is a beautiful edition of the classic, with delicate Art Deco illustrations by Rene Bull. Khayyam's rubai (quatrains), written in the twelfth century, had lain forgotten in a library until the middle of the nineteenth century, when they were discovered by Edward Fitzgerald. His inspired, loose translation organizes the poems into a cycle describing a day. Some references are obscure, some of the language is as difficult as Shakespeare, but for those who enjoy complicated metaphysical poetry this is a delicious treat. Others can simply look at the pictures, which are a fairytale in themselves."
4,"Sorrento Spoon rest, Ruby","This is large, highly polished and the color is dense and very attractive. It looks great on my stove. It is attractive and functional."
4,Great spoon rest,"I ordered this spoon rest and have been very happy with it. It is dishwasher safe and microwave safe. The color is pretty true from my monitor, but it is slightly darker than I expected. I think it is more of a khaki instead of the tan color I was expecting. Its really not that big of a deal though, it still looks good with my kitchen color palette. It is also pretty large in my opinion, which can be nice because I can use it for turners too, but it takes up a little more space than I would like."
5,Greatest spoonrest ever!!,"I purchased one of these several months ago, but it was accidentally broken and I had to get another one, as they are so wide, and just perfect - exactly what I was looking for!!"
2,discolored...,"I bought this item in ""Ivory"". I returned it. Item is discolored. Maybe it was not coated properly? There are red scratch looking marks on the inside and top. The rest is not ""Ivory"" either. Comparing it to the web site photo, it is yellow. It will not match anything white in your kitchen."
2,All scratched up,"Delivery took 3 days longer than estimated. I ordered the ivory since blue (to match my kitchen) wasn't an option. The coating is scratched in so many places and shows an ugly brown color, which will make it difficult to tell quickly if it's clean. This item doesn't look new at all, and I am certainly disappointed."
5,Nice quality,"Very nice color and finish. It is much larger than expected, but that's good. Purchased as a gift and they loved it."
4,Memorable Book,Small hardcover book for the anniversary edition. A lovely story that is enjoyed by children and adults. Wonderful addition to our library.
5,If I found a Wistful Unicorn,"The most touching, beautiful childrens book I've ever read...more adults should read this book..Full of wisdom, beautiful sentiments and love... a must read!"
4,Idealism at its best!,"This book is dimensionally smaller than I hoped, but the words show us the type of relationship we all long and hope for. It is quite special."
1,"Can you say ""cheesy""?","I was hoping that with the glowing reviews that this book received, it would be something I could pass onto others as a token of my affection and appreciation. What I found was something more along the lines of a greeting card than <i>The Giving Tree</i> (which is something like what I was hoping for).The illustrations were nice, I give it that, but this was so utterly *sappy* I'm surprised the pages weren't stuck together. Maybe this would be perfect for the Chicken Soup for the Soul types, but not for people who want a touching story that isn't ridiculously cheesy. The only person I would feel comfortable giving this to, what with the liberal use of the word ""love"", might be my husband - but I wouldn't inflict it upon him. I love him too much!"
4,Newbie to Midi,"Works as described. Cables a little short , having to juggle the keyboard and the PC - be prepared to be surrounded by equipment . Using the MIDI interface successfully with Band in a Box.Check the release of Cakewalk - it is not the latest available."
2,Buyer beware!,"This product contains the 3rd version of the software and there is already a version 4 out. The only benefit in getting this product would be a USB to MIDI i/o cord included.The manual is very poorly written and lacks simple screen shots that could immensly help someone figure out how to set this up. I mostly just used a trial and error method to get going. Once installed it is fun, but I will likely have to spend days figuring it out this software's advance features.Cakewalk: put money in proper manual production and less on BS marketing claims."
4,Wonderful Read,"The author presents an extremely intelligent and persuasive argument that consciousness is not a material matter.Furthermore, he is exceptional in that he continues to try to find some psychological law instead of physical law toexplain consciousness. This truly encourages the evolution of thought process."
3,A Challenging Look at a Complex Subject,"This book was recommended by Eben Alexander, author of Proof of Heaven. For the serious reader, this delves into a fascinating subject that is more complex than you might imagine."
4,A Must Have book for Consciousness Studies/Followers,"Philosophical depth would be an understatement. It took me several days of treadmill running to read this completely through. Reviews consciousness concepts up to 1996. Arguments and reasoning from many philosophers are covered. Chalmers presents many important topics such as logical and natural supervenience, reductive explanations of consciousness, and cognitive modeling. He then covers neurobiological approaches such as Edelman. Naturalistic Dualism is also presented. Conceivability vs possibility is covered early on. However, he only covers some of the possible quantum mechanical explanations, such as Everett's ""many worlds"" hypothesis towards the back of the book, which I felt should be a front cover topic. Overall a great book for those interested in a good overview of the field of possibilities and routes to better understanding of consciousness by one of the founding fathers of the field. Great book!"
1,Probably the worst Book I have ever attempted to Read,"This book was extremely long winded and obtuse. Although the author understands the basics of Quantum Mechanics, I did not see him connecting that knowledge with the workings of the conscious mind, at least in the way he presented it. Part of my PhD thesis dealt heavily with Quantum Mechanics. The only relavence I can see of QM (and Einsteins relativity) to the conscious mind is that we have to be open to the unexpected. It seems that from the evidence of near death experiences, past life recal, the paranormal, telephathy etc, the consious mind has a connection to a non-material consciousness with which it sometimes communicates. The author however does not even allude to this possibility."
1,oh dear,Just not very interesting the way it is written ... a real disappointment. Passed it on or tossed it. Can't win them all.
2,"Perhaps I am dense, but ...","It seems as though the central claim of Chalmers is based on what seems to be a faulty argument. He imagines a molecule-for-molecule identical copy of himself that lacks conscious experience, and then says that because it's logically possible to imagine it, there must be something other than molecules responsible. My problem is that he is jumping the gun. We don't know the brain well enough yet. He is taking an unsolved problem, imagining someone without this feature, then saying that this feature is therefore above the physical. Despite his dismissals of the wait-and-see attitude, I recommend we all do just that when it comes to conscious phenomena."
5,A good intro to the consciousness debate,"Chalmers deserved a mention, as he has done more than most to popularise the consciousness debate - with his term the 'hard problem' and his experiment with black and white Mary. But Chalmers like many others falls down when he puts his cards on the table as to what the true nature of consciousness is. His idea that it is merely an outcome of information processing is rather disappointing."
3,Zombie-land and panpsychism...,"Ah, more fun with Aristotelian logic! Davidson once wrote that even irrational methods can be considered rational if they lead to a rationally-desired end...But what about irrational ends found by purely rational means?Chalmers has some interesting arguments (although for those not really interested in wading through the details of supervenience arguments the Reader's Digest version of this book would be a lot smaller) but as the leading Mysterian demonstrates, there's a lot more to be learned. I'm not sure how he reconciles his result of panpsychism with his apparent belief in the strength of formal logic.Once again, I must point out that anyone interested in neural nets and/or symbolic manipulation for AI had better read Perlovsky's papers on combinatorial complexity."
1,the great pretender,"The main hypothesis of this book, resting on the fictional ""zombie"" Gedankenexperiment is so bizarre & naive that it boggles the mind.Can nature evolve a highly functioning zombie? Of course not. What we call consciousness is a direct product of embodiment - an emergent 'functional state' that allows evolved multicellular creatures to navigate their environment. Therefore the book is mainly hot air.Chalmers thinks of a meaningless/pointless ""hard problem"" and then meanders around through using ""look-at-how-clever-I-am"" mental gymnastics. In other words, he invents mysteries, or nonsense, or both together. Seriously - unless you are a 'neurophilosopher', i suggest you skip this book because you won;t learn anything."
3,Very Useful,"I found this book to be very helpful in knowing what to teach my kids in certain situations. If they have something come up that needs an etiquette answer, I can simply look up that situation and respond appropriately."
1,Not user friendly!,"This book reads as a novel, not a quick reference guide for parents with limited reading time. I would not recommend this book!"
2,OK,"This is an OK DVD, The real CKY is in CKY, CKY2K, AND CKY3 THIS IS ALL JUST SOME REPEATED CRAP, WITH A FEW NEW THINGS. check out the old stuff for some hilarious footage, and way more than seen in this junker."
1,Very Dissapointing,"It took me a while to warm up to Cky 3, but now i think i appreciate it. Cky 4, in comparison to the others, is crap. They spent WAY too little time making it, and you can tell that there is a lack of footage, hence recycling from previous movies and jackass. Somehow i don't find it amusing to hear bam and co. laugh for 5 minutes about something they did. It also lacks the complete random-ness of the first cky. Better luck next time."
1,Scumbags,Skating on and destroying other people's property. Bullying security gaurds who are just trying to make a living. Potentially hurting bystanders in a club by jumping a floor up ontop of a crowd of people.The epitome of skateboard assh*les.Hopefully by the end of Bam's Unholy Union his fans will see him as whipped and quietly crawl back into their holes.Bam's mom is HOT.
5,good stuff,i have seen every cky video and this one 2 me is just as good as the rest even though there is just some new stuff. i still could watch it over and over and i give it 5 out of 5 stars.
5,Great tool!,I use this with my Amazon purchased impact driver when volunteering with Hartford Area Habitat for Humanity for a variety of tasks.
3,Great for the show but not for rock icons.,"I bought this DVD for the Music performances as the title implies but those are far and few between. If you like the Dick Cavett show, this is the one for you. If your looking for the rock icons like the title suggests you may be disappointed by the wait time between songs. They titled this DVD incorrectly. It should be titled ""The best of Dick Cavett. Not ""Rock Icons"""
4,Woodstock Show a Little Disappointing,"I was especially looking forward to the show taped the day after Woodstock ended. I did find this a little disappointing. The music, however, is great. What a trip back to the 60's and 70's."
3,How Did This Guy Get A Show?,I remember watching it when I was younger...I even remember seeing one of his shows in NYC. What I don't remember is how stilted and uncomfortable he appears in these interviews. As much as I enjoyed seeing the performers....they could have been better served by someone else doing the interviews. The David Bowie interview was especially painful to watch.
1,"Inept host, feeble guests","I thought I might be able to recapture some of the original pleasure of watching the Cavett shows, but I was terribly wrong. In contrast to the wit he seemed when I was a kid, he now seems like a witless dolt. His jokes are not funny, his questions not perceptive, and he constantly steps all over his guests' attempts to utter pointless gibberish. The DVD notes make a fool out of Sly Stone, and I expected the worst, but compared to the rest of the numbskulls, and to Cavett himself, Sly comes off rather sensibly. It's hardly necessary to ridicule Sly for drug use when Cavett has raved about the wonderful effects of his own electroshock treatments. Interviews of semi-literate musicians by a shallow, self-obsessed host do not make for pleasurable viewing."
1,Agree with JMark,"Barely watchable. Fragmented answers to fragmented questions. I don't know who was worse, Dick Cavett or the mumblers he was interviewing. Save your money on this one and donate is to a good animal shelter instead."
5,A+,I loved watching this show. I love Dick Cavett and enjoyed watching the rock stars and seeing them with Dick Cavett and performing.
5,Bought this for my dad...he is obsessed.,"This collection is great. My dad was ecstatic when he saw it. I didn't realize how many rock icons this collection contained, I was very impressed myself. Definitely worth the money."
4,Superb compilation,"This is a very nice compilation. There's many around (Strictly Commercial, Cheap Thrills, Son of Cheep Thrills), and this one fits right in! There's no new, nor previously unreleased material on this compilation, but it's a nice item. It contains 18 tracks and it comfortably keeps you listening to it all. The variety in choice is good.Simply a great compilation.Jacco"
3,Small but not Small enough,"I love the New America Standard Version but this bible is not 'pocket' size. This is a bible that doesnot fit in any cover, like the larger ones, and it does not fit in your pocket. I recomend this bible because it is a text only and is nice, but donot think you will put it in your pocket and carry it with you.Recommend- NIV Shirt Pocket New Testament (Leather Bound) for only 6.99!!"
5,Excellent,The notes already made are right on. This is the perfect little bible for daily carry and reading if only the New Testament will do. I think everyone should have one!
4,Biology made VERY simple.,"If you're looking for a good, but VERY basic review book, this one is great. I did not make it through the whole book, but the parts I read were very clearly written. However, it is VERY basic. If you're using this book to study for something like the GRE or the Praxis II exam, you will need another book in addition to this one. But it's a good start if you need a good basic background in biology."
5,ABC of Biology,"This book was so helpful & easy to understand. I also took Biology in the summer and it helped me get an ""A"". When I used it with my undergrad book; it was like reading a summary or each chapter. I highly recommend it."
5,Great Book,"My wife went back to college and had to take Biology, this book was invaluable in helping jumpstart her to get an A+ in the class!"
4,Good product,I bought this by accident; I though it was for cats. I used it on her anyway and still worked great.
