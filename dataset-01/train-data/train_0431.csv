4,A fun game!,"I bought this game for my daughters ages 7 & 4 and they love it! We are a ""gaming"" family and we all played this together. My daughters have mastered it, but it took them quite a while to do so. They are both very adept on the playstation and neither bacame bored, in fact, they still play it even though they have completed all levels. The bonus games are a little tough, even for me. The bubble game is challenging, but fun. The only thing my daughters don't like about this game is that Sebastian talks too much. He gives some helpful hints but can be a bit windy. The graphics are pretty good and my daughters love seeing clips from the movies while they are playing. I would certainly recommend this game to anyone with daughters ages 4-8 and who are into mermaids!"
4,Off The Chain,"The book is Hotttttttt! It did start off alittle slow with character developement and then it took you on a nonstop ride of entertainment. I fell in love with the character Brandie. Is she real????? And I had much respect for Chocolate even though he might as well had got him some before he did, he was already doing everything. But overall great read. Ready for the sequel!"
2,2.5 Stars - Just Ok For Me,"I seem to have the sentiment of the majority of reviewers for this book in that it was a decent effort but just didn't cut it. There were too many plot lines and characters all over the place. I feel if the author would have taken her time to focus on the main character, Chocolate, and not build a hundred storylines, this would have been much better.On a positive twist, I think this author has solid writing skills, she just needs a good editor or somebody who will give honest feedback as she's writing so that her next book doesn't read like a Twister game."
2,2.5 stars,"""Don't Hate the Player"" was an alright read. It was a little slow moving and it was hard for me to stay interested. The story was all over the place and really had no point. It's like the author just wrote a book to be writing a book, there was no ""message"". Better luck on the next book, Brandie. Oh and ""Novelist"" please believe I ain't hating I read some good books check all my reviews. This was not one of them, you all have your opinion, and I have mine. If you want a good book to read that has real message....read "" A Twisted Tale of Karma"" by Amaleka McCall, Brandie can read it too, to get inspiration for her next novel!! Hate on that!"
3,"A Pretty Good Book, BUT..........","This book was so inconsistent! It drove me crazy! And the names in this book...come on! Sap? Trinket? Money Loane? Chocolate Starr? Seal? M&M? No name in this book was normal. It was like reading a soap opera. The book is rather long (400+ pages) which is OK because the story itself was interesting. Overall, the writing is good. But it just seemed to me like the author wrote a little bit then came back weeks (or maybe even months) later to work on it again. Because, for instance, one minute Sap was 4 then she was 3 again! WTF??? Maybe Brandie forgot the specifics of her own story. The story was rather predictable. And I didn't like the ending AT ALL! Too many questions left unanswered. Nice try for the first time, Brandie. I feel the next book will still be worth buying. Just a word of advice...pick a better editor next time who can help w/ the inconsistencies & dialogue."
3,OK,IT WAS GOOD BUT HAD 2 MANY BORING MOMENTS...I HAD A HARD TIME KEEPING UP WITH ALL THE CHARACTERS...THATS NOT KOOL...
4,"Great Talent, Pretty Good Songs","Josh Gracin has such a beautiful voice. So natural and perfect for country. I expect huge things from him in the future. His debut could pave the way for him becoming one of the greats like Kenny or Keith. His first single ""I Want to Live"" is so catchy and fun, it's the perfect song to sing along to in the car with the windows down. ""Nothin' to Lose"" is such a fun song and shows you that he has what it takes to be a country star. My personal favorite ""Brass Bed""(Stay With Me) is a beautiful love song that will be stuck in your head for days. Any country music fan or any fan of pretty love songs and fun summer music, should not think twice about buying this CD. Support real honest talent!"
5,josh,"We aren't here to compare Josh to other country acts or any other artist of other genres!! Josh is Josh!! If you don't like the cd, just write a fair review, this option isn't here to attack these artists!! I myself find Josh wonderful, but I don't go bashing other artists just because I don't like them!!"
5,"Hunky, not Ducky!","Talented, very appealing. Great album! Unlike some overrated Idol's all-squeaks and low-class FLOP CD that didn't even come close to the singles sales figures of the first two Idols."
3,ok,it's not bad. the songs are listenable. more john michael montgomery than garth. don't compare him to garth. garth is a superstar. gracen will never reach that status.
3,Good debut! Chesney and Toby need to look out!,"I liked Josh's album. I think that this is the genre that he's best at. This is probably at or better than the major country talent that he has to compete with. Although the album has a by-the-book feel to how he sings the songs, he's actually that good. He has shades of Garth Brooks in his singing, which might give him the attention he needs. He couldn't grasp the songs he was given to sing on American Idol. On this album, he sounds in fine form, flows through a lot of the songs' landscapes and is very much himself here. All I can say is that Kenny Chesney and Toby Keith need to look out, because Josh Gracin could score several hits from his debut! There's like four or five potential singles to come from here. Hope that his next album is just as strong."
4,Another Idol Comes Good,"I picked up this album expecting nothing exciting - after all, I'm not a country music fan, and I'm only interested in American Idol when it gets to finals time.American Idol may have introduced him to the world, but Josh Gracin has laid claim to the centre stage of the modern country music arena with this debut album.The songs are immediately likeable and there's not a bad apple in the bunch. When he sings the more upbeat songs you can tell he's having a good old time.The stand out songs for me are:I Want To LiveNothin' to LoseEndless Helpless HopingTurn It UpThe Long OneA great start for the ""other"" Josh.Amanda Richards"
4,Good Debut,"I watched Josh Gracin on American Idol and although he wasn't my favorite, I think this is a great debut album for Josh. My favorite tracks are ""I Want to Live"", ""I would Look Good With You"", ""Turn it Up"", and ""The Other Little Soldier""."
1,Crap,The only reason this dude had a deal is because he was on American Idol. He had no business making the finals. There are 20 people who sing better than him who live on my street. Id rather listen to William Hung! At least that is some entertainment!
1,Nashville at its worst,"This is Nashville at its worst, pure and simple. Josh just like Tim Mcgraw, Faith Hill, Kenny Chesney, Shania Twain, Martina McBride, Garth Brooks, LeeAnn Rimes, rascal flatts is a pop singer trying to pass this pop mess off as country. This music is not country its 100% pop. Its fake manufactured bubble gum pop. What else can I say?? He's a fake singer singing fake music. He wont last. He is already on his way to being the next has been. If you wont a singer who can sing real traditional country try randy travis or josh turner"
2,Disappointing,"I really liked Josh on American Idol, but I hate country music. I am disappointed to see his album is all country. I will not be buying this one. It's a great choice if you love country music, but if not this isn't for you."
1,As bad as his singing on American Idol,"This CD just sounds like any other studio-bred performer. On the CD, that is. On American Idol is a different story. I have no idea what they did to his voice here, but this doesn't sound like him. All the way through the top twelve, he just continued to get worse and worse. The only reason why he got as far as he did was because he was in the military and we were at war at the time. If he weren't in the military or if we weren't at war, he wouldn't have made it as far as he did. Those who want to dispute me do not want to face facts: Josh Gracin has no real talents."
4,Never watched American Idol....but am a country fan,"I never watched the season of American Idol that Josh Gracin was in, but I am definitely a country music lover. This album fits perfectly into the genre - yes, definitely reminiscent of Garth Brooks with hints of John Michael Montgomery. You don't need to be an American Idol watcher to enjoy this album if you like country.I'm looking forward to hearing what else Josh Gracin is able to offer to country music - hopefully on the next album he pushes the envelope and tries some edgier pieces."
5,Best AI CD yet!,"Country fits him really well. Great interpretation of voice-appropriate songs. Indeed, as someone has pointed out, way more appealing than the Queen of Ghoul's overrated all-squeaks CD. Josh should come out with more albums!"
5,Awesome,"This is truly a fantastic CD! Some of my friends (who didn't watch American Idol and they dont listen to country) heard it and they loved it so much that they are thinking of buying a copy themelves! The person who says that Josh's CD is painful to listen to seems to be judging this CD from a bias against Josh from American Idol, and I doubt he has even listened to the CD. The CD is awesome and does not sound like overproduced pop. And for your information, Josh plays at least three instruments and can write songs, although he didn't on this album.Most unbiased listeners will say that this is an awesome CD, because it truly is. The songs are catchy, but not cheesy. I strongly recommend people buy it, because it's worth the money!P.S. People buy the CDs of the artists they like, so the artists that sell a lot DO deserve it since the fans are buying it."
4,good debute but not great,"first off i'd ;ike to say that Brass Bed gives this cd a full star because it's one of the best songs i've heard in along time. I'll listen to anything put on country radio (with the exception of Toby Keith, Tim McGraw, Cowboy Troy, Kenny Chesney ans Rascal Flatts)and ive heard alot of people say that this isn't rea; country. well ive got to say that to me it is. he has a good voice and some really good song selection. the only reason i don't give it a five star rating is because there's not a lot of personality on this cd. A little personality would go a long way.Ps: I Always put the best 3 songs and 3 worstBest songs: Wheels, Nothin' To Lose, Brass BedWorst Songs: Peace Of Mind, Endless Helpless Hoping, The Other Little Soldier"
4,"Josh Gracin, a true Idol.","I have followed Josh since the first time I heard him open his mouth at the auditions on AI. He's a natural and this CD definitely showcases his beautiful country sounding voice. For this being his debut CD, he could blow some well-known country singers away. Every song is worth a listen. I was pleased when I played this last night. You'll want to listen to this over and over again. It's a feel good CD. I knew that Josh was going to go places, hopefully he will be around for a long time. The bad reviews are a bunch of rubbish, I honestly don't believe they were listening to the same CD. Buy this now if you don't have it, it's worth its price for sure. I wish they would have included his renditions of I'll Be and Amazed as bonus tracks, that's the only thing I can think of in the line of a complaint, but I guess it's more of wondering why they weren't there as opposed to a complaint."
5,Josh Gracin,I really liked Josh Gracin when he was on American Idol and I hoped that he would be making an album. I really like this album and am looking forward to hearing new music from him. I like Nothin to Lose and Brass Bed.
3,Garth all the way...but...,"Josh sounds like an incoming Garth Brooks. I love his vocals, but he doesn't quite have the IT-FACTOR to have an album yet. He hasn't proven himself as a performer. In my personal opinion, American Idol brought him TOO far into the music industry. There were many better singers in the competition. However...""How Do I Live"" was sensational. Album...6/10"
1,Simply Awful Album,"I seldom write reviews, but when I could do better myself, (and I am a horrid singer), then I feel compelled to express an opinion. The songs on this album represent the worst kind of insincere tripe, full of false emotions and faked attempts at honesty. Gracin is clearly in this just for the money and is so full of himself as to believe those who support him, who are also riding on his coattails and hoping he becomes a bigger star than he is. His talent, what little there is off it, is undeveloped and unworthy of the time it would take to actually listen to this album. In another 5 to 10 years he might be worth a first album. Sorry Gracin, but your 15 minutes are up!"
5,Excellent CD!,"Great voice, great songs. Way, way better than Queen of Ghoul's newly released overrated all-squeaks CD!"
5,The country singer for the non-country girl,"I have never really liked country music. All that stuff about coyboys kissin' their horses and riding off into the sunset just never hit a chord with me at all. In fact, I have made it my life's mission not EVER to listen to country music.However, from the first time I heard Josh Gracin on American Idol, I was hooked. He wasn't singing country then, but everyone who heard him KNEW that was HIS area.I've not been disappointed. I listen to HIS country album a LOT. . .I love his voice, his passion, his attitude. . . who KNOWS why we hook on to one singer and not another? In fact this is my second copy of his album . . . I wore out the first!!He is sssssssooooooooooooooo good!! Try him, you'll like him!!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"After much waiting for the CD to come out all I can say is it is absolutely wonderful! I was a big Josh fan on American Idol but thought this CD was going to be a bit iffy, if you know what I mean. I was so wrong! Josh you out did yourself! It is much better than I ever expected and I highly recommend it to everyone. Song after song.........I loved. It does not let you down. Thank you, Josh! I look for big things in your future."
4,Great Book - Stay with it.,"I read Arc d'x on a whim and was completely blown away by it. I read it ferociously in a couple of days. I decided it was the best book ever written after I read it. So of course I went back to read more novels by this undiscovered, underappreciated genius (two of his books are out of print - un forgivable). I have to say I was a little disappointed by Rubicon Beach, but I went ahead and read Days Between Stations. At first, like Rubicon Beach, I didn't get engulfed by the book, but when I hit the second half I was entranced. The book sucked me in completely, and when I was done all I could think about was reading more of Erickson's books."
5,"Like a trip on a controlled substance, but more real.","Reading one of Erickson' books is like entering a surreal dreamscape. His prose is lyrical and his vision and sensitivity startling. This is perhaps the most important book to me personally, that I have ever read. I love the way he plays with time to create paralell universes. I love his vision that time is like a river and can meander around but, in the end, reunifies itself. Underscores the old axiom that everything turns out the way it is supposed to."
4,Shades of Magic Realism,"This magical book by a Los Angeles writer forms a perfect introduction to the American appropriation of Magic Realism. It's definitely not a ""futuristic book,"" but one that saturates Garcia Marquez with the mentality of today's southern California."
2,Rushed Paced & Uneven,"This movie is disappointing because it's not exactly bad....& it's not exactly good either.The visuals are great (especially the showing of Daredevil's ""radar sense"") & most of the fight scenes. (I liked the bar fight & the fight in the church, but the shoolyard fight between Matt Murdock & Elektra was just plain ridiculous & corny!) Matt Murdock's character & background were fully developed (though illogically changed from the comic-book original. He doesn't save a blind man anymore. He just gets caught in a loading accident.)But everything else about this movie is RUSHED. Fast-pacing for an action film is necessary, but everything else, from the Kingpin's introduction, to Elektra's relationship with Daredevil (& no, she's NOT a ninja in this movie the way she is in the comic-book, because she doesn't live elong enough to become a paid mercenary!) is just way to quick.If they have a sequel, let's hope they'll get it right the second time around."
3,DD = (D)ifferent (D)aredevil,"Let's just say it's not like the other ""Marvel"" movies.This movie was much more darker and more sensual than the other ""Marvel"" movies, so it is not really recommended for kids, and that is a shame because most of the money superhero movies get are from the kids cause for some reason children like those ""Superhero"" type movies. +The action sequenses are to fast so you really can't see anything. - I don't like that"
2,Dissapointing,"Too cheesy. How does going blind give you flea-like jumping abilities? All the characters (other than king-pin) were just boring and flat or over-acted. The fight scenes even looked completely fake and horrible. Suspending disbelief is not a possiblity in this movie. Not even for a second. I don't expect much realism out of a superhero movie, but yikes. This is just poo. Apparently in this world gravity is slightly lower (or occasionally non-existant...) than our Earth... Speed Racer was more realistic, maybe they'll turn that into a superhero movie next."
2,I Wouldn't Even Dare The Devil To Watch This!,"My hopes for this movie were shattered. It was extremely fake. I didn't like the whole ""I want revenge"" thing. It took the ""superhero"" out of Daredevil. The stunts and moves, as well at the scenery were so bogus. I felt like I was watching a CGI movie rather than a superhero thriller.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It was quite violent! That was something I didn't expect.Take my advice, save your money and spend it on something useful. This movie is not worth it. Not you money, your time, or your energy."
1,Not even close,"This has to be the worst Marvel movie ever. The movie is not true to the comic at all. First of all, Daredevil's origin is completely changed (he became blind when he saved a man from crossing the street!). The movie also has terrible casting. Sure, Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell did great as their characters, but Jennifer Garner as Elektra?!? Pleaase...Elektra is supposed to be a deadly assassin with looks to die for. And oh yeah, Greek also. Casting for the Kingpin was terrible as well. Michael Clarke Duncan might be a very big person, but he is not Wilson Fisk. Way too many characters were introduced at once, completely ruining the movie. Directors need to stop trying to make movies based on comics for non-comic readers; they should be made for fans who read the comics and stay true to the original stories. Marvel and Avi Arad: Stop ruining good comics like Daredevil and the Hulk with movies with weak story lines!"
4,pretty good,DAREDEVIL gave me what I wanted as a fan of the comic and threw in a few twists too. Great movie and the director's cut should be better. I don't agree with the reviewers who say the writer didn't bring any imagination or original ideas to the mix. He did. The entire vigilante to hero angle is a new and major one and a gutsy one.
2,What is Hollywood thinking,"Okay honestly, I liked this movie, but there are quite a few people out there that didn't care for the theatrical release of this movie. What makes Hollywood think they can rip people off by selling them a special edition less than 2 years after the original hit DVD. How greedy can Hollywood get. But then again, I guess we can see how greedy they are with the amount of SE and DC movies coming out this year less than a year after their original release."
3,Fascist Delight,"Daredevil, the Director's Cut should satisfy every action hero buff, except for one thing:no charisma. Smoldering away in a stew of hatred and revenge, he is notsomeone you'd care to invite for dinner. Some may take a liking to his illegally punishinghoodlums, all ethics aside. Civic minded citizens, however, will no doubt naysay his shooting the defendantshe prosecutes when losing the case. As far as brooding is concerned, the same argument might be made againstBatman--- except that Batman does not kill his enemies outright. Besides, he is much more engaging when notwrapped up in his alter ego. Outside of the flagrant flaw described, the movie is a fast paced, visual delight, tobe taken with generous helpings of popcorn."
1,Worst movie ever!,"I cannot believe there are acutally people out there who liked this movie! This has to be the worst movie ever made. When the movie first began, his childhood story seemed really well done but as the movie continued it just went from bad to worse. I can't believe anyone could sit through the entire movie, I turned it off within 30 minuets and that was torture enough!"
1,"Blame Johnson, Smith, and Miller","These three so called film makers are perfect together, they all have input on this Daredevil movie and it becomes a disaster. What a surprise, how about hiring someone who is a good film maker to work on Daredevil. He deserves better then being ripped apart in this junk fest. Both theater cut and director's cut are for the birds."
1,"A BOMB, plain and simple...","The first two (Tim Burton-directed) 'Batman' movies rock. 'Spider-Man' was hugely entertaining. Even Chris Reeve and Margot Kidder had their moments in 'Superman.'This film, however, is a total mess and unbelievably boring. In a nutshell: Awful, painfully dark cinematography, absolutely atrocious acting by the two leads, and a startlingly inept ""screenplay.""It's just too depressing. Hollywood: stop already, you're killing me.Avoid, avoid, AVOID--at any cost."
4,Best comicbook move since original superman,"I just watched this on DVD and can't believe how much I liked it. The story is nothing new, it could have been pieced together from ten different films, but the acting and storytelling are very good. I'm not sure why I am surprised. I know all the actors in the film are talented and I usually enjoy the movies they star in. I just wasn't compelled to see this movie when it was it theaters. Now I wish I had.I liked the Hulk and Spider-man, but there were times during those films where I thought ""come on already; get to another action scene"". In Daredevil, I enjoyed the scenes between the action as much as the fighting. Not that the action wasn't good. It just didn't outshine the characters.I have never read a Daredevil comic. I didn't know anything about this superhero before this movie. But as far as films go I liked it better than Hulk, better than Spider-man, better than Batman. It's probably the best comic-to-movie film since the original Superman."
3,"Fun, forgettable action flick","Daredevil is a pretty good action flick, but nothing makes it stand out as a time-enduring classic.The Good: Nice action, realistic (somewhat) hero, decent plotline, good characters, comic-book feelThe Bad: Weak dialogue, Ben Affleck (though his face is covered most of the time), standard super hero storyOverall, not a waste of time, but not anything to go out of your way for."
5,"Feature packed DVD, and a good movie too!","The Daredevil DVD has lots of cool special features (2 disks worth!), and is a good movie too.Fans of the comic won't be let down, and people who liked Batman should probably like Daredevil. It's a darker movie than Spider-Man, but is still very good."
4,Ben who?,"There are several reasons why this movie is such fun. Unfortunately, none of them is named Affleck. Everytime I hear him listed as an Academy Award winner, I wish they had to say that it wasn't for his acting abilities.Jennifer Garner as Electra is perfect. Colin Farrell as Bullseye is right on target (sorry, couldn't resist). The effects work is first rate.This is the epitome of a popcorn movie. Just sit back, relax and enjoy it for what it is. As a translation of a comic to screen, it stands up fairly well. Unfortunately, the only thing that didn't translate from that two-dimensional world was Ben Affleck. The rest of the movie is exceptional."
2,"A movie watching maybe once, but not more","I found this movie to be dark and violent. I don't know if it was the acting or the writing, but it just didn't click with me. The martial arts were impressive, but I've seen more enjoyable movies with moves just as good.The one thing I did like was the use of rain and water to accent the emotions of the two main characters."
2,There goes the girl and the movie.,"So! Have you been awake during the times of STUPIDITY? I mean man this has got to be the lamest movie. The action was good and the acting ok and the rest well let me see...[was bad]! The music was the best part of the movie and so were a couple of the fight scenes. When Elektra and ""Daredevil"" are fighting that was dumb when she didn't kill him I mean she had a clear shot at him and she takes the time to take off his mask when all that precious time she could have cut him up. So Elektra and ""Bull's Eye"" Fight and the Sai through her hand was awesome and then there she goes of course that's it and the movie get's pretty dull from there and that is all i have to say!"
2,a movie for the comic bookstore nerds!!!,"ok. to enjoy this movie, you must suspend your sense of reality and common sense and believe the following things are true:(1) if you have a horrible accident with acid and you lost your sight, your other senses (especially your ears) will be so powerful that you can sense your environment better than anyone by emitting and hearing ultrasonic sounds like bats do.(2) if a girl doesn't give her telephone number, stalk and then beat the crap out of her until she agrees to go out with you.(3) the only newspaper New Yorkers read is the New York Post.(4) if you are a black man from Bronx, you must be a bad gansta who has enough fighting skill to engage in hand-to-hand combat with a superhero.In short, save your money. If you must see a comic book movie, see Spiderman."
2,"It isn't Afflecks fault, but..","Daredevil is the worst comic to screen adaption since Batman Forever. Lots of high dollar effects, disconnected characters that we can not connect with and a city that feels like a rehash Gotham from one of the Batman movies of the 90's. It's just that bad. Also the their's a upsetting mid-movie event (won't spoil it for those who must see this) that leaves little hope for the ending.."
3,Not quite disappointing,"The movie was ok, the whole mythos of Daredevil being secondary to Spiderman, the Hulk, the XMen-----no one ever screams ""We need back-up, bring in Daredevil!"" Ben Affleck does a pretty good job as the sightless superhero and Colin Farrell is good as Bullseye too. Jennifer Garner is.....passable as Elektra. But you can't fault that she has the physical chops to play the part. Jon Favreau is funny as Foggy Nelson, Matt Murdocks best friend and lawyer partner and Michael Duncan Clarke makes a fun Kingpin.The movie is ok but its like everyone is doing their ""superhero"" movie. The stunts are fun and Daredevil's radar vision is interesting but its not the best superhero movie I've seen. Honestly I'm not sure which is."
3,Daredevil,"Based on the MARVEL comic book series, DAREDEVIL is a visually stunning adaption, but it lacks the good-natured fun of the recent CB movies like X-MEN and SPIDER-MAN. Mixed reviews haven't dampened it's commercial output however, seeing the latest film in the long string of superhero movies being one of the more succesful. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson, Daredevil centres around a young boy who loses his sight in an accident. Ben Affleck plays the title hero who uses his other over-developed senses to fight criminals. Whereas Tobey Maguire was perfect for the role of Spiderman, Affleck fares less well, playing a visually-impared superhero. The villians including the up-and-coming Colin Farrell who does an excellent job as the lethal Bullseye. Michael Clark Duncan does little more than order people around and while Jennifer Garner (Elektra) provides eye candy but little else. Overall, it's eye-popping and cool, but lacks the wonder and excitement of previous MARVEL films."
2,Needed some work,"The film Daredevil is the first in a string of comic book movies hoping to cash in on the success of Spider-man and X-men. While it could've been a very good film some major points hold it back.Ben Affleck stars as Matt Murdock, a lawyer blinded at the age of 12 from some acid. While he can't see, he has more power in his remaining four senses. He soon meets Elektra (Jennifer Garner) who he falls in love with. Soon after Daredevil runs into Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) who wants Elektra's father dead by an assassin named Bullseye (Colin Farrell)The film has some major flaws though. The fights aren't as polished as they should be, the characters (Everyone of them except Daredevil) needed some major character development done, and finally, the dialogue sounds corny.If the rest of the comic-book movies are like this I don't want to see them"
1,Where's the plot?,"Nothing happened in this entire movie. Do you know who the Kingpin is and why he does what he does? I don't, and I've grown up reading about the character! Atrocious acting (Michael Clark Duncan is WAY overrated, Ben Affleck is emotionless) and a terrible non-existent script make me ashamed for Hollywood in general."
1,Daredevil=One of the worst movies ever made!,Omfg! I absolutely hated this movie! It made no sense at all! Actually the only reason I picked up the movie (thankfully it was rented!) was because Evanescence music was in the movie and I was just curious. Movies like these make me want to believe that movies with good soundtracks aren't worth watching!
1,Awful! Awfullllll!,"Oh my God, I haven't seen Gigli but I can't imagine it being any worse than this terrible, terrible film. The thing that kills me is that there are good writers in the world...why are they hiring the people that put together this awful, cliche-ridden, cheesy voice-over using, put-the-exposition-and-motivation-right-in-the-characters'-mouths junk! And i have to say, I really like Ben Affleck, and I LOVE Jennifer Garner, so I just don't know what the heck is going on here. As I might have mentioned before, the script is terrible. Ben and Jennifer's relationship is kinda creepy and misogynistic with violent undertones. Poor, poor Jon Favreau is stuck slaving away as the lone element of hope in this god-forsaken mess. And I can't comment about the supposed twists and turns, because I turned the DVD off after 15 minutes. As a writer, every cell in my body was screaming out in horror at this film. Terrible!"
1,Noooooooooooooo!,"This is one movie you won't want to not miss! Honestly, whose idea was it to have daredevil play fight Electra? That scene makes me so sick to my stomach. I tried to vomit but I couldn't because my vomit was afraid of seeing this movie. The soundtrack is the worst! It is as if they found a bad compilation cd on the ground in a highschool parking lot and decided, hey, lets use this instead of some composer and his crummy orchestra. I bought this movie hoping they would have cut out the horrible electra love scenes and changed the music but they hadn't. They kept everything that sucked about the original release and that makes it even suckier. This is the only comicbook movie worse than Fantastic 4. Keep your 7 dollars. Do not buy this dvd unless you want to hurt yourself."
4,Better than Spider-Man!,"DareDevil is a better movie than Spider-Man!Why?Because in Spider-Man I think the special-effects could have been better.Sometimes it looked like Spider-Man was computerized and cheesy.DareDevil has great effects.The story is awesome.The action is awesome.But I cannot give this film 5 stars.One reason,there are better super hero movies like SuperMan.I love superhero movies but I never read the comic books.So I recommend this film to everyone,But they should of gone more into the story of how he became DareDevil,but I still recommend this great film."
3,pleasantly watchable,"there are a lot worse ways to spend a few hours than watching daredevil. fine cast, cool characters, memorable moments, good dvd extras, and great soundtrack. not quite up there with other recent comic movies since daredevil is an odd hero and comic, but a cool way to spend time in front of the t.v. from time to time."
4,enjoyable,"I agree with the three and a half star rating Daredevil is getting. It's not an awful movie like some say, but not quite five star material which is okay by me. They tried too hard to put WAAAY too much from the comics into one movie, but Ive seen movies where they left far too much out and I applaud the makers of Daredevil for trying to put as much into it as they could. It's never boring! I guess the playground scene would also have to be cut to make this a slightly better movie, but as unrealistic as it is I still like the playful mating dance between Elektra and Matt Murdock/Daredevil in that scene. The movie soundtrack is great. Bullseye and Kingpin are a little different, but no less cool than in the comic. All the pieces don't fit quite right, but the director and writer deserves credit for giving it his best shot. I've watched Daredevil more than once and it's a good action movie and the DVD is filled with groovy extras so it's a worthy purchase."
3,interesting take on the comic book,"i recently bought daredevil on dvd, while its loaded with 2 disks of speacial features this movie just dosent deliever as it was put... this movie has ben affleck who i dont see as a superhero i see him ore the comedy as in chasing amy or the kevin smith series or playing an ex con in reindeer games. The movies action is so so not over the top and not to boring of a movie. just a plain pre summer action comic turned movie.. rent it if youve seen spiderman and x men and the hulk.."
4,Very Good Entertainment,"Daredevil is very entertaining. Affleck deserves credit. Insecure little boys will miss most of the fun while complaining about Ben, but if you don't fall into that group, and are a fan of comic book styled entertainment, you should check this one out."
4,Perfect adaptation of this film,"Matt Murdock (Affleck) loses his sight (and his father when he refuse to take a dive in a boxing match for some petty criminals) from a childhood accident. But it upgraded all of his other senses and becomes the vigilante know as Daredevil (at night, while he becoming a lawyer by day).I admit, I have a thing when movies being made from comic books (or even from TV shows etc.) because most of them don't translate very well or that it should be left alone. But not this one! Everyone should commended for a great job with this film, it's a brilliant film from start to finish. Jennifer Garner does a great job (although it seems like it was limited) playing Elektra (who has a martial arts background, captures Daredevil/Murdock's heart)."
2,Hype.,I think you should get this movie only if you love marvel type movies such as Spiderman and whatnot. The superhero in this one is blind... its almost comical but I don't think thats they way they wanted it to be interpreted. The movie is getting hyped way more than it should... Rent it before you buy it and spend your money on a dvd you'll actually watch more than once or twice.
4,different from spider-man,"I saw this movie twice and its a very cool movie, it was decent and ben affleck did good with daredevil. I thought it was gonna be like spider-man a little bit but it actually turned out to be different from spider-man, it was more hardcore and had its own style, it was also a dark movie too. This is a movie worth seeing right here and everyone will enjoy it and this is the year of marvel since they have X-men 2 and the Hulk coming later this year. I like comic book movies and they're entertaining and next year in 2004, Spider-man 2 will be out and i hope they make a punisher movie now that ill pay to see!."
3,"Good Chapter 1 to new franchise, so-so movie","This movie started off great. Beautiful style, cool visual effects and great development of back story to Daredevil. That was the best part unfortunately. The characters all had very cool introductions and looked amazing and then I just wanted them to do something. ANYTHING!The movie ends in a very unsatisfactory way. Of course we know there will be sequels to the sequels but show us something in the meantime to make us want to come back. The end leaves you feeling somewhere between a commercial break and a season finale but without any actual cliffhanger even, just an 'I'll be back' cliche equivalent. Very disappointing."
4,Hopes for this DVD,"I too really love the original theatrical release and bought the 2-disc edition awhile back. I do generally have an aversion to Hollywood marketing ploys, but from what I heard Mark Steven Johnson on his commentary from the previous release, they were really crunched on time during the production, especially with some of the CG stuff. They also battled quite a bit with the MPAA to keep their PG-13 rating. (It's difficult to be true to the darkness in the comic book series while marketing it for the most optimum revenue returns.) Hopefully, they've taken the time to sensically incorporate the extra fight footage into the story and brush up on a few of the painful CG shots (amidst many good ones). Marketing ploys aside, I think there's added pressure for directors these days to ""get the product out the door"" that they have to make various artistic compromises (à la LOTR). I really do hope that this DVD was made for Johnson to ""complete his original vision"" for an already good film!"
3,mediocre superhero movie,"this is about a man called matt murdock ( ben affleck) who was blinded by toxic waste as a boy but still can tell whats around him, and with that he fights crime. the villains are bullseye played by Colin Farell and Kingpin (Michael Duncan Clarke) who try to take him down. He also meets a girl called Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) who likes him at first but after he is accused of killing her father, she tries to kill him. the movie is ok, and the action is good, but it isnt one of my favourites. Instead of buying it rent it cause it ain't really worth the money.KrayZ187"
1,no artistic integrity,"Real artisits aren't in it for currency. Superhero and hobbit movies are made to fill the pg-13 CGI nitch and make money. Spiderman was awful, X Men was retarded, The Hulk was a bad effect, and now this is about a character who can't even see! It's all about the money and not art.Don't buy into it."
1,As bad as Gigli?!?,"Oh my god, was this movie bad! I forced myself to get to the end of it to see if it got any better. I was disappointed! What happened to Ben Affleck? He used to be able to act. (Or maybe he was just good at playing the same character over and over again!) Characters looked happy to be killed so they could escape from the set! Don't waste your money!"
2,Nooo!,"This is a terrible movie, and a terrible adaption of the comic. I thought I'd give it another try because I saw it when it first came out, and thought it was stupid. I thought I might have been distracted or something. Wrong, I was right the first time. The ""director's cut"" is supposedly better, but that's not saying much. It fails on all levels, and I fell asleep halfway through the second time I watched it. Even though I collect comic book movies, I regret buying this."
2,Superhero?,Might be a better Daredevil but not a good comic superhero. The original Batman still holds that crown.
1,Daredevil needs to go to hell,This film is worser than Batman and Robin and Superman combined.Ben Affleck was so bad for the part it's laughable and Jennifer Garner as Elektra was wasted.Daredevil is about a blind boy now a man fighting crime.Daredevil is darker and lamer than Spiderman{which was a better comic book movie}.poor Stan Lee and Kevin Smith make cameos in this trash.the plot was so bad it was either action or comedy! and the actors and actresses that starred in this should feel ashamed.a waste of time and money to watch a loser in a red suit fight crime.go to hell Daredevil and bring this film with you
2,One of the worst comicbook adaptations to make it to the big screen,"Wow. What a dud. I grew up reading Marvel comicbooks, and am embarrassed whenever I see such terrible adaptations hit the screen. And why -- leaving aside the crappy script, muddled direction, abysmal acting, murky scenery and sound design -- do they have to muck around with the original plotline so much? Why not just tell the character's story the way it was originally written? It's a shame, really.I wish Hollywood would quit writing and producing these things by committee, and let someone with real talent and vision take on the comicbook ouvre... The prefab, market-tested, throw-in-the-kitchen-sink-too approach simply does not work. Hey Hollywood: keep it simple. (Axton)"
3,Better than expected Gothic romp,"Cracking comic book adaption with a hilarious performance from Colin Farrel. Allegedly based on Alex from 'A Clockwork Orange' crossed with Sid Vicious, his Bullseye actually reminds you of Bob Goldthwait's Zed from the 'Police Academy' series. His special features contributions are delightfully incomprehensible, too. Ben Affleck is at his least irritating as well. Photography is excellent. This was obviously a labour of love for the director. Nothing much to feed the brain but for once I wouldn't have minded a sequel."
4,not a kid movie,"This movie was supposed to be a superhero movie based on a comic.it was more of a love plot. I gave it four stars because some parts were funny and the fighting,affects, and the dialogue was good. if those bad scenes were taken out, then i would give it 5 stars. overall, it was a great movie to see a few times. i do reccomend it for those of you who enjoy the comics."
4,Hey I haven't seen a daredevil....... anything for a while,"I have to say that I am a comic geek. I am also a fan of the Daredevil movie. I haven't seen anything relating to daredevil for awile execpt comics. Well to start off it is about a kid who's eyes get contaminated with radiation and hes blind. I won't ruin the rest for you, but DareDevil isn't as famous as The Incredible Hulk, Spiderman, Superman, or Batman. This is acually a superb example of a not-so-famous superhero makin' it to the big screen. Although the texture rendering was kinda underdone like Star Wars Episode 1. Yeah its not like we can't tell that that effect was cgi. I hope it does well with other people insteat me, my brother, ebert&robert."
2,My high expectations made this even worse,"I had high hopes for this movie; the cast is great (at least for the female lead, and Kingpin, even though it took me a while to get used to that). I usually like comics, and the movies they lead to, but this was developed too slowly and overall it was too dark, and I wasn't able to see the Daredevil character as anybody to look up to. I was extremely unhappy on my first viewing (I may have even fallen asleep), but after my expectations were lowered, it wasn't as bad on future viewings. I think this was made with the hope of making a franchise, but they really blew it."
4,not bad for a blind guy,"When I was a kid in the 60's I bought every issue I could of Daredevil, The Fantastic Four, and Doctor Strange. I kept up with Daredevil longer than I did with any other comic book. I kept reading his adventures until the early 80's and then we parted company. I had kids to raise and stopped reading comics and started working more. The ads for this movie brought back memories of my younger days with Daredevil. I also had mixed feelings and didn't want Hollywood to screw up my hero. I've now watched it on DVD. When the movie ended and the credits rolled I was left feeling pretty damn good. Daredevil was in good shape and it was nice to see him again. This movie did him justice. No complaints. It was a good show served up in the mighty Marvel manner."
2,bad,"SPOILERthough i never saw the daredevil comic book so i cannot relate it to the movie, this movie SUCKED. it was also kinda sad because of jennifer garner dying so early in the movie and all... ben affleck is a really bad actor, wow, boy oh boy does he suck. the only performance i liked here was colin farrell as bullseye. he's plays the villian very well. the plot wasn't too deep and i don't remember this being a summer popcorn movie... well, this movie was very bad and i don't recomend it to anybody."
4,"Be a Daredevil, and watch it!","I saw Daredevil in the theaters and I must say it was very different then the other Marvel movies that I have seen, such as X-Men, X2:X-Men United, and Spider-Man. This movie was much darker and had a more serious story than the preveous Marvel Comic Movies. Ben Affleck plays the role of Matt Murdock/Darevil very well, much better than I expected. Jennifer Garnner plays a very good Elektra. She portrays the comic book charactor very well. Overall there isn't that much bad acting in the film, which makes me wounder why it didn't do well in the Box Office. The 'Special Features' on the DVD are not as good as they sound. I was very disappointed with that part of the DVD.Overall: This would be better for a weekend rental rather than buying it."
3,LOgans review,I thought that this movie was quite well written and thought out clearly. I do think that it could have been better but was still a very very very good movie.
4,Much better than the original,"This is the movie that should have been released in theaters. It was much, much, much better than the original version."
1,Unpleasant,"I usually like superhero movies, but I found Daredevil to be just unpleasant to watch. Almost completely bereft of sympathetic characters (maybe Jon Farveau's character was okay), poorly structured, not involving at all, and Good Lord, I just wanted to slap Ben Affleck's holier-than-thou lawyer across the courtroom for being so self-righteous (""I only represent the innocent"", he says...but it's okay for him to murder in cold blood...puh-leeze!!!). Far and away the best thing about this movie was Colin Farell's character of Bullseye. If you want to watch a good superhero movie, try one of the X-Men films or Spiderman."
1,Boring,"Daredevil was a boring movie to watch. The dialogue was cheesy and there was no chemistry between any of the characters. This movie looked like it was just thrown together. It didn't flow very well. I am not a big Ben Affleck fan, but he is not what made this movie so bad, it was the writing. When I watched Spider-man I got really into his character and you can feel his every emotion, but in Daredevil I could care less. He didn't pull me into the movie at all. And when Elektra dies I didn't feel sad or sorry for Matt Murdock because their was no real chemistry between them. The writing could have been much better. And when Daredevil and Kingpin finally meet there was absolutely no intensity what so ever."
4,helluva good time,afleck. what can i say about afleck. i never liked him in any other movie. i didn't like him a lot! i think putting him in ths movie earned it quite a few bad reviews it didn't deserve. part of the problem is that he seems like the guy with all the women and other guys don't like that guy. i've tried to look past that. why? because...this isn't easy to say... he was good in daredevil. i kinda dug him just a little in this role and only this role. the movie is a great time and yeah afleck is better here than in anything else.
5,very different!,"totally different from what i was expecting. i thought it would be all sugar and happiness, like in spiderman, but the action sequences both surprised me and kept me on the edge of my seat. literally. i dont know how accurate it is based on the comic books, but i think it was worth seeing."
5,This Is A Great Comic Book FIlck,DAREDEVIL is a great movie. The Effects are good and the stunts are excellent. I thought it was better that Spiderman and X-men. I thought it ranked up there with the first Superman and Batman. It confused me how Daredevil fought and after I saw this movie now I have an idea. This is a great comic book flick.
3,Mediocre,"A young man loses his vision, but all his other senses are heightened, so he does what any handicapped person would do, he becomes a crime-fighting super hero. There are some good action scenes and Jennifer Garner never looked better, but there is something about watching Ben Affleck try to act that makes me wish I couldn't see."
3,it was okay...,The best thing about the movie was the casting of the villains. Michael Clark Duncan was perfect as Kingpin (even though Kinpin was originally white) and Colin Farrell certainly made Bullseye the movie's most unforgettable character.
4,A Flawed Hero,"I enjoyed this movie. I was not sure what to expect but I did like the movie overall. I found the title character a unique superhero who was easy to relate to. Jennifer Garner and Colin Farrell practiclaly steal the show. The stunts were great and the special effects superb. This is not your run of the mill super hero flick. It is a step above in concept, writing and acting."
1,i hate this bad movie too,"I would like to mention this movie. The music is godawful. Brilliant New York attourney listens to teenie-booper pitty party music when he is feeling pissy. Every action scene is backed by horrible, cheesey teen-angst metal music or white-boy rap. Yuck. So, what you have here is an already terrible movie that is rendered almost completely unwatchable by its vomit-inducing soundtrack."
4,daredevile,"this movies thad to weigh,thad cause great shock in cinemas it is a fantastic movie of marvel, the best actor is a king pinkg.that covers a great parst of errors the spider ma, finally is a great produchon of accion an ficcion it a great production"
3,Much Better...Like Spraying Lysol on Crap!,"So I'm being harsh. This movie IS entertaining. But it's certainly no prize. If you must watch or own a version, the director's cut is definately the one to get, because it is indeed a vast improvement from the original.Understand though, the director, a practical no-name, was bullied by the studio during the entire filming. It was HIS mistake for picking Ben Affleck, yes, but in his favor he DID try to get a more comic book accurate costume, to which the studio said, ""too much like Spider-man"".Instead, they gave him a pleather track suit with a dog collar and said, ""now that's dynamite baby!""Other than that, it's a fun movie, but the music alone could drive you mad."
1,How dare they waste my time...............,"I thought Affleck was great in ""Phantoms"". He's horrible in this role. He wasn't a very convincing blind person.It actually started of pretty good but went downhill quickly.When the Jennifer Gardner character was introduced it went from dumb to dumber. She is a lame actress. I guess she fit the suit.Don't let Hollywood fool you by putting a couple of big names in the movie and trying to pass it of as a legitimate effort.The movie is horrible. I couldn't finish it.I left 3/4 of the way through it to mow the yard, in the dark."
1,Lets play a game,"k, I hated this film I really did, but I want to hear your opinion, if you agree with me(that this is a bad movie) press ""yes"" if you dont press ""no""."
1,Worst Marvel Movie EVER!!!!,"Honestly, I don't think that there was a single person in the production or studio that was not completely drunk or high on cocaine. Compare this film with any other Marvel film (Except Punisher w/Tom Jane) That was crap too! Stan Lee is getting older and there seems to be a necessity to pump out as many of the comics with little or no disregard to the true and factual story-lines. This film was put together with names vs. characters. Ben, Jen, and Michael were all the hype to watch this film. Had this movie been released in the 80's or 90's I would have cried at the disgrace, but seeing as how anyone who owns anything worth any substance sells it like a Prostitute, I am not surprised. Watch this movie with ear plugs and a blind fold while tripping on acid, then, and only then will this movie not want you to hate everything Marvel stands for. Enjoy!!"
1,if i could only give it a 0,this movie really is cheesy. please run away far away from any store with this movie.
1,"Deer Senator McCain, It","Aflac is blind, like in reel life, he cabnt sea his iminant divorce, what a daredevil. Aflac is not natural hair, folcacly challended. I thought he was best actor/ writer but why isn't Damon in this film. I think htey right all their mvoes togterher? Why? Can enyone explain? This movie is a real movie, thought, I htink the ocmic is goiod and this pays leverage to tolkien as well. But why, again, why is daemon not co-writing wiht aflac here? Can any locomotive whisper the password is open-sesame to me and the warg?"
1,garbage,"this movie is terrible. do not buy this. do not rent this. this is an insult to anyone who loves comics. just watch spiderman again, daredevil is a movie of garbage."
4,more clever than credited,"i am a media studies/television production degree student and although i know this doesn't add any more weight to my opinion i'd advise all serious movie viewers that were critical of this movie and called it juvenile, should give it a second viewing, whilst not comparing it to genuinely(but fun)juvenile movies like spiderman and xmen. look closely at the mise en scene and symbolism that permiates this film. for example a man dressed as the devil fighting a man in a church with pierced hands (stigmata) this really is a quite clever film that works on two levels much like the simpsons. watch it again."
2,Nothing new here,"We have seen it all before. I gave this movie a second star because some of the effects were cool, but the organization and character development get zero stars. I found it difficult to care about the main characters. The back-story is dumped into the beginning of the film like a frozen bit in a hamburger. I feel there was a great story hidden somewhere in this mess, but it just didn't make it to the screen."
3,Bullseye!!,"this was better than Spider-man last year. Ben Affleck is really grat as Daredevil and Jennifer Garner is sexy in leather ad Elektra. Michael Clarke Duncan is huge as Kingpin and of course theres Mr. Colin Farrell whos brilliant as Bullseye, he steals the whole movie. there are cameos in here by Stan Lee and Kevin Smith too and David Keith adds spark as the little devils dad who gets killed in the beginning. great action scenes but some are corny as hell, like that fight between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner when its daylight out and by the kids playground."
4,Better Than Expected. Elektra (Jennifer Garner) Is H-O-T !!,"So this isn't a great movie. I was still pleasantly surprised. The story was interesting. The acting was fine (Ben Affleck made a convincing ""Daredevil,""). The lesser characters were well portrayed (""Bull's-eye"" was appropriately nasty, and even the ... man playing the ""Kingpin"" role was okay- did he have to be a not so fat ... man, come on Stan Lee- you should have protested that decision). The person who ""stole the show"" was Jennifer Garner as ""Elektra."" Who cares about the character she was playing in the overall story; she was just plain awesome with her appearance alone. What a BABE! WOW!"
5,Great Movie!,"I Loved This movie! I thought it had a great cast and great story, though the ending bothered me alittle. If you enjoyed spiderman you'll love this. Very good movie definitely one of my favorites!"
3,Violent,"Very violent, too violent for me. It has way more violence than Blade or anything else I've seen."
4,Quite good but not great,Took the family to see this movie (may have been first mistake). Quite a bit of violence so you'll need to be prepared for that. Ben and Jen were excellent. The martial arts scenes were exceptional. Great special effects. The story was a bit weak. Asked the kids and they unanimously preferred Spiderman.
3,see it,this a step down from x men and spider man but its still good. tis could have been ten time as more better if they have had added about 20 minutes but for now this will do. good fun super hero fun
3,A Little Too Corny,"The movie overall didn't fit together right. Their so-called ""cliffhangers"" didn't even make sense. Everything was too predictable, and during the ""fight scene"" between Electra and Matt, it was so obvious that neither of them were trying. I will only see the movie again for one reason, two words: Colin Farrell. He made the show completely worthwhile. His character was adorable and he acted with such dignity and poise that he lighted the screen up every time he was visible. I am so glad that he won the Teen Choice Award: Best Villain, for his apperance. Ben Affleck appeared to have no passion for his role, and Jennifer Garner just wasn't believable. In a nut shell, if you are really looking forward to watching this movie, be prepared for some horrible scenes and traumatizing killings."
2,Another bad choice for Affleck...and you,"Right there at the bottom of the Comic-book-turned-movie heap. Slow and unexciting, only two things make the movie worth watching...Colin Farrell as ""Bullseye,"" who adds energy everytime he's on camera, and Jennifer Garner who adds real sparks. But just as she starts to gain your interest - she's gone! Ben Affleck apparently thinks being blind means walking through scenes like a zombie (sort of like his performance in Pearl Harbor!) Even the action sequences are enervated by the jumpy, dark (and boring) effects trying to show Daredevil's auditory bat sense.There are also some tremendous ""suspension-of-disbelief"" howlers, and the climactic fight scene is truly weak and anticlimactic...designed only to set up a sequel. Now if the sequel could feature a resurrected Jennifer Garner it might be worthwhile.Buy it and watch it? Only if the only thing on television is another insipid ""reality"" show!"
3,Daredevil falls a little short.,"I was looking forward to this film because I am a huge fan of Marvel movies and I really really loooved spiderman so i thought theyd make this one just as good , although this movie was good i think it fell short of my expectations maybe if spiderman was never made this wouldve been better but spiderman raised the bar but this is still a good movie. In conclusion unless you absolutely love this comic book don't buy this or at least rent it first ."
1,Terrible Movie,"Awful movie!! Terrible plot! Corny fight scenes. I would not recommend watching this movie at all. I gave it a one star because that was the lowest rating I could give it. If there was any lower rating, it would have gotten that."
4,Good Marvel Film,This movie wasnt the best but it wasnt bad either it had its ups and downs Ben Affleck had a great performance why does everyone bash on him hes a good actor....daredevil mainly came out in febuary because it wasnt really convinceing to be a summer movie since daredevil never really one of marvel's most popular characters all in all it was good i will se the sequel if it comes out for sure
4,What Do You Want?,"The staff here and in a lot of media venues, take movies like this, ""way too"" seriously...It's a comicbook made movie....get it? I loved the ""fun""...as i have Spiderman, Superman,and the Batman films...Nothing ""deep""...no ""subplots""...just ""FUN"". One BONUS..here is Jennifer Garner...She is GREAT in the role of Electra...if you enjoy ALIAS...you'll like her here too! Afine looking lady, who can kick some ...! Well, you know...!A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE!"
1,Run for the hills,"Five minutes is all it takes for you to know that this one for laying down and avoiding. It is tempting to rent because it was a big movie which you were smart enough to avoid in the theaters, ""but what the heck it's only a rental"" - right? Don't fall for it, don't finance the sequel or you will be hurting people not even born yet."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"JENNIFER GARNER DIES!!!And there was no character development...the movie was too fast in the storyline....oh wait, there wasn't one...""wam bam, thankyou mam""....enough said."
5,The Best Marvel Movie,"This movie was about a little kid named Matt Mettock(Ben Afflict)who became blind. He's Dad was killed by the Kingpin of New yorkand Matt then swears to bring Justice to the streets and becomesDaredevil. I think this was the best film marvel made,you reallyfeel for the characters. This was realy good."
2,I give this movie....2 STARS!!!!,"When I first saw the trailers for Daredevil I thought (like I thought for the Hulk) that this movie was going to be awesome. After 3 weeks it came out I dragged my family to see it with me, boy do I wish I had never seen the movie. Not only that it lacked plot, it was utterly boring and unmoving. It was sad when the father died but i found myself wanting to fall a sleep. The only good part about this movie was that the main girl kicked butt! Colin Farrel was pretty good as a villan but I think they could of done more with him."
1,Terrible,"Although I really enjoyed the performances of Suge Knight as Kingpin and Rob Halford as Bullseye, this movie really stunk it up. Terrible script, hokey acting, hackneyed plot, the worst martial arts I've ever seen, insulting to the audience, fake-looking special effects, cliche supporting characters you don't care in the least about, storyline slapped together like a house a cards, this entire film is a mess. Stick with ""Spider-Man"" or ""X-Men"" instead. Heck, I'd even take ""Batman And Robin"" over this disaster of a film."
1,Terrible!,This movie was terrible. The story was absolutely numbing. The interviews on the second disk with the writers/creators of the comic book was much more interesting to me. The DTS soundtrack does have some serious bass in it for you subwoofer fans out there.
1,Worse than Gigli,"Okay Ben Affleck, no more movies for you. This movie was horrendous. No, I'm not a fan of the comics, and wouldn't want to be after realizing this is such a dull super hero. Ben Affleck is terrible, as always. Jennifer Garner, who only looks like she does on the cover after she gets mad, fights a bunch of sand bags that miraculously fall from her ceiling and goes out and almost gets instantly killed by Bullseye. (so I heard she's not really dead, I just hope there's not a sequel so I can find out) The effects were so AWFUL. Does anyone realize that CG effects are almost never well done? (Except in LOTR and anything that Spielberg uses them in) And the character of Daredevil...so when you're blind you can jump real high? Yeah don't waste you money."
1,Daredevil,"I saw this movie in the theatre and was not happy with it. I bought the DVD for my husband and I gave it a second viewing thinking maybe I'd like it the second time around. It only convinced me of what a waste of about 2 hours it was. The scenes are rushed, the story weak. I hated the whole Murdock/Electra romance. It was WAY TOO RUSHED!!!!! Even the way he met her and their duel just so he could get her name was extremely stupid and pointless. Then, the second time he meets her, they end up in bed together! YIKES! There was NO character development and the whole movie was rushed. Even the Kingpin/Daredevil face-off left something to be desired. The only saving factor was Bullseye. Done the right way, this movie could have been great. I was bored to tears seeing this in the theatre and seeing it again on DVD only re-enforced my opinion. I absolutely hate this movie and would not recommend buying the DVD. rent it, but do not buy it."
3,Not All That Great!!!,"This movie was really not all that great. The way the movie was designed it looked like a second rate independent movie. I know this was not the case and I think they just could have done a better job. I had trouble staying focused on this movie as well, it seemed that the movie would stop and go and stop and go. It never did develop a comfortable flow of the story. The characters were horribly developed and even Ben Affleck seemed ackward playing the role of Daredevil. I recommend that if you are in the mood for superheroes buy the old Batman movie."
3,"All Frosting, But No Cake","On one level this is a very lavish movie that's jam packed with action. Yet on another level this has so little substance that there's not really much of a story to get involved with. So without a story you basically end up with a movie full of props, and not much more.Some have compared Daredevil to the comic book and have pointed out that this really comes across much like reading frame by frame. I think that's true, but then again this is a movie and not a comic book. A movie needs a bit more depth to make it worth while......Hopefully they try again, but with a different director."
5,LOVED IT,"Yeah it's cheesy at times. Yeah it's also dark. Yeah they tried too hard to mix the campy 60's comic stuff with the darker modern comic stuff, but I still really loved this movie. I'm glad I gave Daredevil a look."
4,pays tribute to the comic book's legacy,"How can a Daredevil fan hate this movie? It's not perfect, but it's heart is in the right place. They went over and above the call of duty by having a priest named Everett, the John Romita bit, the Frank Miller scene, I loved the Stan the Man's scene, the names Miller, Mack, and Bendis are in there, a bad guy named Joe Quesada, Kevin Smith even shows up as ""Kirby""...I loved it."
3,what do you people want,"People say Daredevil never confesses, but how many times do you see somebody in a movie sit down and look at a menu. If we don't see em eat it dont mean that they dont eat. Daredevil starts to confess in the standard way and is cut off by the padre. He goes back later. Who knows what he says? Where's the problem with that? Its not a problem. He's talking to his padre. It shows he has soul. He's not heartless. He's got conscience. Some people are waaay too serious and stuffy. This movie is supposed to be fun. It is. I liked the action. Bullseye is a trip! The subway scene is off the hook! There's touching scenes too. It's a good. Not great, but good for sure."
2,Receives the typical Affleck stamp of (dis)approval,"How can anyone watch a movie like the Dark Knight and think Daredevil is a 5-star superhero movie? No, seriously. Tell me. Are you and I watching the same thing here?On top of having a ridiculous origin story, it is also a typically clichéd one (childhood trauma, parent/guardian dies) bad acting, and a soundtrack that sounds good over a car stereo but when used in a movie soundtrack, immediately demotes that fim to B-movie status. Extra star awarded to this movie for having a cool villain in Michael Clark Duncan and Colin Farrell, who for some reason both decided this movie was worthy of them."
4,Decent movie,"I am familiar with the basic story of the Daredevil comic books, so I think the movie does a decent job of adapting from the book. Sure, some people don't like this, and I don't claim it's a GREAT movie, but I honestly didn't think it was bad at all, and feel confident giving it a 4-star rating."
2,So... empty,"Wow was this.. empty. It seemed like a lot of the movie had been cut because the transitions from one plot aspect to the next seemed choppy- too abrupt. One minute Electra wouldn't give Matt her name, the next minute they were kissing, the next minute they were doing the sex. This movie was just so vapid- especially compared to Spiderman which took pains to develop the characters and bring out their humanity, building an action movie that was also emotional. Daredevil was just missing something essential and epitomized Hollywood blockbuster film at its worst. The only thing I can say is the bat-style sonar effects were well done. Oh, and of course the Stan Lee cameo always tickles me."
2,youre kidding me!,"I had high hoped for this movie, because i am a casual dare-devil fan/ guess what, i hated pretty much every minute of it. the acting was awefull, they chose the worst villians to put in, and elektra shouldnt have been there at all (its not called daredevil and freinds!)! the CG's were OK, but the action was kind of lame. i'd MUCH rather be watching a '60's low budget kung fu movie than this."
2,Only worth it for Bullseye and Kingpin,"Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan owned this movie. Ben Affleck doesn't convince me as a hero for a moment, and Jennifer Garner -- a martial arts assassin? What, was Britney Spears unavailable? Please. She looks about as legitimate as a killer as she does a spy in Alias. Which is to say, not a all. She got this job (and her Alias job) with her _____. Period, end of story. Fight scenes are OK, other than that though, this blows."
1,READ THE COMICS!,Ok this movie was absolutely horrific. It did not follow the comic very well. I felt Ben Afleck was Not Good. And Jennifer Garner as ELEKTRA (one of the greatest characters in comic history). I Think one person who could compare to Elektra at all would be Catherine Zeta Jones. And Why Would FRANK MILLER The absolute best of them all evn want to have a small cameo. Frank Miller Took Daredevil to where it became greatness in the 80's and should have written the script.Whats with changing Kingpin to a black man. Im Not racist or anything but come on KINGPIN is not BLACK!! I give one star because its the lowest i can go!
1,Embarassingly bad...,"First of all, this is not my type of movie at all, but Colin Farrell was in it and my Husband was interseted so I decided to give it a try. UGH. This movie was sooo bad. The acting(if you can call it that), the plot....(was there one?)....the whole thing was so cheesy I cringed with discomfort while watching...I eventually fell asleep towards the end ..I honestly feel that being passed out on my couch was better time spent than witnessing the conclusion to this mindless mess of a movie. All I can say is that this just further reinforces my belief that if you want a GOOD story, skip the movies and read a book instead."
1,Tragic!,"It is a crime that Ben Affleck has the ability to get good roles like this and Screw up what could have been a good movie if someone else had gotten the leading role. Ben Affleck tries to incorporate the magic of the Spider-man movie into this steaming pile of crap, but everything about it is awful. Jennifer Garner's character has no depth, Jon Favreau is annoying and does not make the film any better, and Affleck is not believable as a super-hero with great fighting skill. Cuba Gooding Jr. would have been GREAT as Daredevil and is a much better actor than Affleck ever was. Even Silent Bob would be a better Daredevil than Affleck. Don't bother wasting your time with this"
3,Video quality is sub par,"Make no mistakes, the director's cut is geared towards fans of the first version and will not win any converts. Although a lot of additional scenes have been added, the characters are still not fleshed out enough and the plot holes remain unanswered.But the biggest cause for disappointment is the horrible video transfer. On a regular 4:3 TV, the encoding problems are not as noticeable, but viewed on a widescreen television in anamorphic, the heavy pixelation or blurred pixels become distracting. With so many dark scenes and fast action, the bitrate should have been increased, or a better encoding method used."
4,Good Comic Book Movie,"With the influx of comic book adaptations in the past few years, ""Daredevil"" kind of got lost in the shuffle. To my mind, it is one of the better screen treatments of a Marvel comic book to date. The story and the backstory, for that matter, are utterly compelling. Ben Affleck, an actor I normally loathe, actually delivers a multi-layered performance as the blind activist-lawyer by day, masked crusader by night. Jennifer Garner is simply luminous as Electra. The sky is the limit for Garner. Colin Farrell, another actor who normally doesn't impress me, is charismatically comicly menacing as Bullseye. Michael Clarke Duncan is fearsome as Kingpin. This film didn't get great reviews on initial release and had kind of lukewarm box office. ""Daredevil"" is definitely a film in serious need of re-evaluation."
1,Do not waste your money on this,"This is easily one of the worst films of 2003. The script is ludicrous and repulsive. There are plot holes the size of Texas in this thing. Aside from Colin Farrel, the cast proves itself to be very untalented. (Although Jennifer Garner is nice to look at.) The action sequences are tolerable, but the climactic fight between Daredevil and The Kingpin was a very big disappointment."
2,One of Marvel's duds,"I love superhero movies, but Daredevil is pretty mediocre. The character is much more violent than in the comics too."
2,boring and silly saved only by the villains,"Affleck has never been less convincing. Garner has never looked better, and the story was never very interesting.This film is redeemed by three things. Great sets, and two great villains. I so wanted to see Ben Affleck get whooped by both of the central villains-who were both terrific. Colin Farrel and the other villain (sorry, I don't know his name but he does lots of tv commercials) have fun-and when they are on the screen it is fun to watch. Unfortunately the camera focuses on Affleck and his inability to emote. Yawn, couldn't they just make Farrel's villain the main character so we can watch him beat up Affleck?"
1,You can't be serious!!!!,"Worst movie I've seen in years! I can't beleive people actually liked it. I went with my husband and friend on opening night and we all thought it stunk. I'm not really that familiar w/the commic and didn't really know the concept behind Daredevil so when I realized that the Daredevil was a blind man I just could not get into it. In fact, I just laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of it all. Ben Aflact was unconvincing as a super hero and the dialogue was pathetic. Even Jennifer Garner couldn't sell it and she sells it every Sunday night on Alias.Beter than Spiderman, I really don't think so...."
1,A wonderful comic book movie! Better than Captain America!,"Daredevil tells the story of a young boy who lost his genitals in a forklift accident and becomes blind. With much passion, he learns to overcome this and become a fighter just like his father and he prowls the streets at night searching for his mother. He dresses up in a dopey costume similar to the one featured in the movie Daddy Day Care. Jennifer Garner plays a character who is just a token love interest, Colin Farrell plays a guy who can throw things really fast, and Michael Clarke Duncan plays a big kingpin dude. The movie also features Bernie Mac portraying a midget and Jennifer Lopez as Ben Affleck's girlfriend. Oh, and Queen Latifah sings something about mambo somewhere in the movie. I give Daredevil a rating of 15.5 out of 4 stars."
1,"hollywood has no shame,","and people buying this ''directors cut'' have no brains.how does the saying go?!?!?!? a fool and their money.......this was/IS a horrible movie no matter what cut it is.i never gave into a blind super hero.no matter how in tune he is to his overly hyped up other senses,you cant sense a bullet and move fast enough.the bad guys were comic relief and garner,why was she even in this?!?!?!?!?does there always have to be a love interest?!?!?(if the makers want women in the seats i guess so....ggggrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@catering!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)heres a funny,but true story when i went to see this mess....about 30 minutes into it i was awakened by someone elses louder snoring.that sums it up for me."
2,not what I expected,"I'm not sure whether or not this movie holds up with the comics but regardless, I really didn't care for it. Sure, alot of people probably didn't like ... but that was just one of the things wrong with this movie. ... I'm not a Ben Affleck fan either but he is not the reason Daredevil wasn't good in my opinion. The plot seemed completely thrown together as if the producers were in a hurry to get this movie done so that money could be made at the box office. Not much was put into the development of the characters and I found some of the dialogue to be a somewhat slow at times. However, I do agree that making a movie about a blind superhero along with a babe for a sidekick and a villan from another comic series was a great idea. Sadly though, I felt there was much that should have been done with Daredevil."
3,Underwelmed,"I suppose I expected too much. A lot of critics holding this one up higher than it deserved, too many people saying Ben Affleck made his finest performance yet. Anyway, there where a lot of problems, but most of them come from a tired cliched super hero plot line and very poor direction and editing. The man who killed Owen Meany needs to make a few more movies before he can handle the action genre. Didn't have a fraction of the fun and excitment of Spider-Man, or the mood of Batman.Decent performances by the cast, a little campy on Colin Farrel's part, but what can you do. Jennifer and Ben did the best they could be expected with such a briefly scripted romance, another weak point.In my humble opinion, the script needed a few more rewrites and an experienced director.As it is, didn't hate, didn't love it. Just disappointed.God . . . no one is going to like this review . . ."
3,pretty much okay,The best thing about the movie was the casting of its villains. Michael Clarke Duncan was perfect for the role of Kingpin (even though Kingpin was originally white) and Colin Farrell's performance definitely made Bullseye unforgettable.
4,worth a look,"Daredevil isn't flawless, but it's not bad. There's a lot to like in this movie. The way Daredevil grows from taking the law into his own hands to being more heroic makes for an entertaining movie. The development from killer to hero is interesting stuff for a supehero movie and it's dealt with very well. That and the extras earn it a B+."
3,"good movie, bad casting(except farrel)","I liked the story and animation in the movie. But hated the crew. I'm sick of Marvel and there bad casting jobs. Pick somebody off the street that looks like daredevil or the king pin, not somebody that doesn't suit the role. Marvel has so much money and talent and they waste it on a bad cast.(exception, X-men and blade). Get a director that really knows the story and the characters and then pick the cast. The acting in the movie isn't too bad but they don't fit the profile. That's why I'm rating it out of 3. If I ever got in the movie business, I would direct good comic movies instead of the crap they're making."

2,Not That Good,"Okay. I found this film (on DVD) disappointing. I was a DareDevil comic book fan back in ""the day"", but I've long since forgotten the story. This film starts out pretty good with the story of the development of DD and how he lost his dad and gained supersensory powers. The fight scenes were pretty good, but other than these two things, the film just doesn't make it. The villians do much more for this film than DD himself. Ben Affleck doesn't get the job done! His love interest helps, but dies (as does the film) Rent it if youl haven't seen it --DON'T buy it. SpiderMan was tremendously superior!!"
4,A fun comic book movie...better than spider-man,"This is not an academy award winner, but it is an entertaining movie with a great cast. Ben Affleck puts out one of his better performances as the blind superhero, Matt Murdock, better known as the Daredevil. And Jennifer Garner is absolutely stunning in her role as Elektra Natchios. Daredevil is darker than Spider-Man and is the best comic book movie since the first Batman. The plot is weak at times, but that does not take away from the energy of the movie."
2,Ouch!,Oy! That hurt! Stan Lee gave us Spider Man and it was great but then he threw this at us! JJJJJUUUUNNNNKKKKK! Very mildly entertaining but I gotta say: I nearly fell asleep! Don't waste your time. You might like it but best stick with spider Man.
2,What's to like?,"Daredevil is empty, and silly. Of course, you'd expect that from a movie that has a laughably bad fight/dance sequence involving Ben Affleck. Yes, you heard right. I was tempted to yell out, ""Hey! They're break dance fighting!"" Of course, I didn't.Daredevil has plot that is mush--predictable when it ought to be surprising, dull when it ought to be exciting, and funny when it never really intends to be. Ain't that a recipe for disaster? I won't spend more time dissecting it because it just isn't worth it. It represents the inevitable: Bland corporate types seeing the Spiderman and X-Men money machines and wanting to cash in with uncreative drivel. ""Find me a superhero! From Marvel if you can! And get the Sexiest Guys on Earth to star!! That's the ticket.""Don't make the same mistake I made. Don't waste a good two hours."
2,Overhyped,"Really not even remotely as good as everybody makes it sound. The story is not deep at all, no substacne to it and really just another comicbook story. Nothing to see hear, nothing worth raving about, not worth buying, but not a complete waste of time either."
2,Disappointing....,"OK, I was reading these reviews, and I just don't get them. Some people are acting as if this movie is the greatest thing in history (it's not), while others act as if it was just the worst thing ever (it's not). It's mediocre!!! I would give it 2 1/2 stars if I could. There really isn't much of a plot, but the special effects are tight, and I guess the messages of love, justice, etc. can be cool. Personally, I would not buy this (unfortunately I did) but I would rent it at least. Just don't expect it to be Spiderman or something. By the way, if you're a rock fan, check out the soundtrack for the movie."
3,From Kuwait,"Simply put, the information contained within this book is good information BUT it appears to have not been proof read prior to type setting and printing. I bought 2 copies of the same book, both had numerous errors each page making it hard to read."
4,tina deloach,"I love reading Andrew Murray, along with many other men of his era. However whoever typed this selection did not do justice to the original! There were many errors in typing...ie stool instead of stood; heath instead of death; mount moorish instead of mount Moriah: just in the first few pages alone."
1,Hardly a page without serious typographical errors,"Had read this book before and thought it was a classic. This new copy has no name of the publisher, but it is filled with serious typos. Some of the typos, such as ""hate"" rather than ""date"" completely change the meaning of the sentence. A wonderful book changed into garbage because of the lack of proof reading."
3,Unusually made books,"I don't think I've ever seen books that look like they were massively produced using substandard practices.They were, however, without physical damage, and arrived in a fair amount of time.But I do think ordering 2 of the same books, or when ordering multiples from one company, the shipping whould be combined and discounted. They could have been shipped through the post office."
1,"Great Book, but got terrible quality printing","This is a great book, however, there are so many typos and misspellings in this copy that it is very difficult to read. I have tried to contact Amazon about the terrible quality of this printing, but they only responded by asking me to write this review. I hesitate to order from Amazon again. Also, there seems to be no phone number to contact Amazon with the problem. I would not recommend buying from this seller again."
3,"Tough, tought read - Great content","While the subject is covered well and I would probably say as completely as one can biblically, the writing style causes this book to be a very hard read. I would love the contents of this book to be covered by a better writer. Great doctrine, tough read. Final grade - C+"
3,It COULD be a great read...,"I am so disappointed in the Kindle translation for this book. What could have been a wonderful and transforming book was reduced to unbelievable typo's and grammer mistakes which caused total havoc to the written language. I don't think it would have been worth it even if the book was free, which it almost was. To take the words of such a great author who is trying to explain the Power of the Blood of Jesus Christ and render those words unreadable is a sin in it's self. Why was this not proofed? Don't buy this edition"
4,Operation Shylock,"I just read Operation Shylock over a 48-hour period--a very concentrated dose. I read Everyman last week, and this was very different--much denser, richer, more paranoid, you name it.Overall I like Roth a lot--I feel like I don't totally ""get"" him, in that his style is so simple, so unadorned, that I constantly find myself thinking ""this is one of the world's great writers""? But that's not meant to be a knock--he writes about heavy heavy stuff, and in a very clear way, and it grabs you, so obviously he's doing something very right.He's not my favorite, but I'm definitely going to continue reading his work."
3,Creative and Witty,"In Operation Shylock, Philip Roth once again plays himself. This time he stumbles into a bad mental episode triggered by lousy sleeping pills when he discovers that someone in Israel is imitating him. He heads to Israel to meet is enigmatic doppleganger, and all the while a heavily publicized trial is taking place involving a possible Nazi war criminal. Roth discovers that his doppelganger is a man using his fame to espouse the theory of diasporism, the idea that all of the non-Arabic Jews of the Levant should return to their roots in Europe. This novel is filled with bizarre bits of Jewish ironic comedy. There is an organization called Anti-Semites Anonymous, which is devoted to curing the threat of anti-antisemitism in Eastern Europe. This is a multi-faceted and highly original work of literature, though I found Roth to tread into severe solipsism as the novel's literary devices become more and more introspective and prolegoamatic. Not a great book, but still very interesting."
5,One of the funniest novels I've read!,"In an interview published in the New Yorker about 5 years ago, film critic Pauline Kael said of Operation Shylock that it was the funniest book since Naked Lunch . Those striking words awoke my curiosity right away, and eventually, brought me to discover this truly hilarious and brilliant book - and then, over the years, other amazing works from one of the great living novelists."
2,Boring. The plot plods along.,"Boring, slow moving plot. Too much discussion of the Jewish Diaspora, Zionism, and Demjanjuk. I couldn't finish this book fast enough.Read ""Goodbye, Columbus"" or ""Portnoy's Complaint"" instead. Both are funnier and flow better than ""Shylock""."
3,Huh?,"This is an interesting book but not interesting enough for me to want to re-read it. The book is about an author who, after suffering severe depression caused by a sleep medication, becomes involved with the Mossad and his own double. By the end of the book, one is wondering if this was not one more hallucination."
2,Over-rated/Insipid/Boring,"Philip roth has been touted as a great writer.I must admit, i was curious and bought this book in an effort to validate what others say.However, i must say that OPERATION SHYLOCK is one hell of a boring bland slow-paced book. Sure, the occasional paragraphs on religion did interest me slightly but the story sucks and the prose did not possess one ounce of magnetism.Trust me, mail me the $ if you have to, but don't waste it here."
5,Elegant Solo Accoustic Guitar Arrangements,"Tim Sparks gives fresh life to Tchaikovsky's classic Nutcracker, masterfully and elegantly. A local jazz channel aired this work from start to finish late one evening, to my pleasant surprise, and kept me glued to my seat. Each piece is just as creative and beautiful as the preceding one. As a composer/guitarist, and in contrast to another reviewer's rating, I'd give this work 5 stars--even if it included only a single arrangement."
4,I SO Wish I Could Play Like This!,"Tim Sparks is unbelievably talented. It's hard to believe one man is playing all of these notes!If you have studied and played fingerstyle guitar, this is a nice inspiring CD to listen to, especially during the Christmas holiday.I took off one star because the recording seems particularly QUIET! After turning this CD UP in the car to hear it as I feel it should be played, the radio practically blasts out the windows after I turn in off. Mildly annoying. :-)"
2,bad service,"bad service. I sent in 2 messages 3 weeks ago requiring an return code for one of the books I purchased, but nobody replied up to date."
3,Just Okay II...,"I titled this review ""Just Okay II"" because I just did a review of D.W. Brown's acting book, and I could have simply copy and pasted it as a review for this book. To start with there isn't a dimes worth of difference between the two books. Both start out with some basic but solid instruction, and then break off into specific ways to create the appearance of certain conditions: drunk, drugged, etc. Both books would be a good start for an actor, but in my opinion both fail to provide anything about acting craft that you couldn't find off of free websites. As with my recommendation of the other book, I'll state here that my recommendation for a beginning actor would be to buy Eric Morris' books. I realize they're no as trendy as these books, but they bring the good stuff."
3,Recent History Lesson,"Content very interesting in light of the rise of the food production industry. However, the Kindle version was not good at all. Many misspelled and hyphenated words, out of whack spacing, etc. It was very distracting and the worst from that perspective of all the books I have read on Kindle. I also wondered if there were some pictures, which I would guess there were in a book of this type, but there were none to be found. Summary: super interesting content, terrible Kindle translation."
2,Bland read,"I was looking forward to this book. I've found it reads more like a text book rather than a biography. I'm really bored with it and find myself skipping ahead, anxious to finish it."
3,American Empress,A fascinating read of an era gone by. Found many of the incidents repetitive. I would not spend the time to read this account again.
5,American Empress: The Life and times of Marjorie Merriweather Post,"This was excellent! Must read learned so much about life, cereals frozen foods, and General foods. Lifes of movie stars and of course Mrs. Post family.I would suggest reading or giving for gifts."
3,Great content but poor transcription!,"Well-written and entertaining book about a fascinating woman. However, the kindle transcription seriously deteriorates at times to the point that it's tough to get the gist of the content. For example, on page 301 (of page 382 of the iPad kindle edition) I counted 16 errors, including ""iJuwai"" instead of ""Durant"", ""WaUis's"" for ""Wallis's"" and ""immculioned"" for.....Ok, that one defeated me. The kindle version is definitely worth the price (under $5) but the buyer should be prepared for a few strange passages!"
3,Obvious there was no proofing done on this one,Interesting story but all the spelling errors were very distracting - a freshman literature class could have done a better job of proofing it.
4,Thoughtful and thought-provoking,"It took a while for the author to grow on me. She doesn't hide her own flawed characteristics as she traces her footsteps through the lives of key women in her life from mother to friends to daughter, all through the prism of kitchens and heart-warming food. The writing is beautiful. If you don't warm to the book straight away give it time. This is a keeper."
2,to much appeasing here,I dug there first album alot but this album trys to hard to appeal to everybody&loses it's edge.they did everything that Floetry is doing now back four years ago&I just don't feel this set compared to there first one.there are some moments but alot of this set feels like they were just making a Safe Album for the label.
3,"A Les Nubians fan from Sicklerville, NJ","I was somewhat disappointed when I listened to the new CD. I had gone to several record stores to purchase it because I was so impressed with the first CD. I am a true Sade fan and was happy to hear two sisters who had the same type of vibe. Please go back to that flavor and do your own thing, not hip-hop and American rapping."
3,Not the belle of the ball,"A newcomer to the group, I nonetheless had high hopes for One Step Forward upon setting it into my stereo. I was deeply wounded when I realized the truth.One Step Forward is boring.Two or three nice tracks stand out as examples of good songs that simply needed a bit more 'oomph' to push them to the category of ""hits,"" and some needed only a little more work in the studio to make them sonically interesting, but in all the album leaves no impression at all.However, when the band came to town, touring with the fabulous Zap Mama, I simply had to try them out. And I'll tell you, as dull and uninspired as the new offering was, that was how good the live concert became. I urge you to listen to the cd before you buy, but get concert tickets on a whim. You won't regret it."
2,I bought it yesterday -- sold it today.,"Sorry, but there is something that I found unbelievably annoying about Les Nubians' sophomoric effort.They don't appear to have evolved or ""stepped forward"" from their debut CD. This CD is so...cookie cut almost. There's nothing new that catches your ear. None of the tracks beg you to play them twice, far less crank up your volume.I appreciate their first CD, but this, ugh! I couldn't keep it around. Not even for one day."
3,Love the Reggae Sound,"I heard Les Nubians for the first time on public radio in Los Angeles. I was immediately caught by the reggae sound of ""El son Raggae"" - track number 5 on the new CD. This song is still the best one on the CD. If I were thinking of buying this CD again, I would much rather buy the single of that track rather than the entire album. Additionally, I would much rather hear the entire album in French rather than hearing the forced English lyrics. Like others who have reviewed here, I think that the English tracks are a bit of a ""sell out"" move by classy international artists."
3,Good tunes,"This album isn't there best. leaves a lot to be desired. But, it's still an enjoyable CD. Need to hear the rest of their discography."
4,A moving story...,"A good attempt by Arun Gandhi to tell the world more about *the woman* behind the succesful Man,Mahatma.But its more an account of Gandhiji's life and then and there he sheds light on Kasturbhai Gandhi which I am sure anybody would know by reading ""My Experiments with Truth"" by Gandhiji.But its still a good biography to read about the Gandhi family."
3,I wish there was more about Kastur,"I liked this book, but there wasn't enough in it about Kastur. There are virtually no quotes by her in the whole book. It is mostly a narrative about the life of Mahatma and then talks about her in his life here and there. I still enjoyed it, though, as the story of their life and times is amazing and inspiring."
2,Initial disappointment,"Rich feature set in this camcorder. Stills are surprisingly good. However, after about one hour of use the LCD screen failed (went dark, but still functioned, just could not read under anything less than direct light). The unit is currently on its way back to a repair facility under warranty. Stay tuned."
4,Great!,"The Sony Camcorder has been great; I love the size and the easy use. One major problem I've had is getting it to connect to my Apple iBook. I love using iMovie, but can't get the computer to find the camera when I connect it. I've read other sites saying that they aren't compatible. [after I bought the camera!] But it's still a great camera."
3,Good for PC owners,"Pros - No Tapes, small form size, easy controls and menu navigationCons - No Mac support, high compression results in low image qualityBottom line - I returned mine and went back to using an old Digital 8 because I had to jump through too many hoops to make it work with imovie."
1,Sony HDR XR-200 Hates Mac,"Mac has been the preferred video platform over PC for years, yet Sony refuses to support Mac. I purchased a Sony HDR XR-200 and the software that came with it works only with Windows. Sony lets you do a work-around, but it is a total pain. I plan on returning this camcorder tomorrow."
4,Great quality - a few quirks,"This is our first camcorder. It seemed to make more sense to have video stored on disk than to mess around with tapes, so we bought this hard-drive based device.The video quality is really good, night shot works great, and battery life seems OK. The microphone isn't as sensitive as I'd hoped... it picks up the voice of the person filming really good, but not necessarily the person being filmed.Getting the SR200 to talk to the computer is non-intuitive. The instructions really aren't clear. After a bit of fiddling, I got it to work. You need to use the included software to copy movies from the camcorder to the PC, and also to delete movies from the camcorder.I'm also underwhelmed by the editing and DVD-authoring capabilities of the included software. I'm going to look for another program to actually burn DVDs.All-in-all, it boils down to great hardware, so-so software."
4,Great Purchase!!,"I bought this as a gift to my dad on his retirement. He always wanted to go with Sony, specially when it comes to camcorders. This was a great product and definitely one of the better ones out of the whole lot. Price is also not too bad (although if you wait a month or two you might find better deals in thanksgiving)As always amazon.com had one of the best deals and not to forget its one of the highest trusted online shopping websites."
4,"Great Little Camera, Until...",This camera has been wonderful for 2.5 years. Great quality. Easy to use. Until it fails. I bought this for $500. I guess I expected it to last for more than 2 years. The camera didn't die slowly either. Worked one minute. Stopped working the next. And that was that. LCD screen fizzled out.
4,Works great,"I'm mad it doesn't have 1-click to burn on MACINTOSH but otherwise it's a great camera. So easy to re-watch clips.. I honeslty have yet to burn a DVD yet.. my mac has a DVD burner but my PC doesn't... and then my PC didn't seem to ""see"" it... so all that of course can be a pain and take some patience to figure out. So in that way it's not as simple as tapes, but I don't miss tapes! I have uploaded some video's to youtube to show my parents in another state our new baby, that was easy (on my mac anyway). Sony sucks for not making the software to burn it easily on the mac!"
4,Very nice Camera,"I loved this camera, easy to use, lot of functions, pictures are good quality.There are 2 things I wish this camera had though, one is better zoom, it is only 10x, I was tempted to buy the other with 40x (DCR-SR42) but some important features were lost.The other thing is that I havent found a way to record clear at nigths, image is blurry when there is not enough light, I wonder if I need to buy extra flash/light.Other than those things, I am very happy with it."
4,Nice piece of garget,"It's extremely easy to set up, record, file-transfer. Since I have window Vista, the movie-making is just a snap. The 4MP intergrated camera makes this camcorder lots more convenient (2 in 1). I should get this baby long long time ago. However, at the high-quality recording, the picture gets really blurry when recording a moving object; the battery life is quite short (less than 1 hr of recording time). That is why I only give 4 stars for the rating. Hope this is helpful."
5,Great camping accessory,"Works great around the house. The afternoon or morning of mowing, walk around yard and sprinkle on mounds and later mow without ant issues. Camping is great when arriving at site and find a few mounds, just sprinkle on mound and by the time all is set up and your ready to relax most of all your ant issues are taken care of. With small children, it sure prevents them being covered and bitten by ants from mounds across the yard. It works so often our stores are out and in Wal-Mart it is seasonal so I buy it thru Amazon by the case and have it on hand."
2,Too much hype,"Eh, there is one song on this album that's ok, if you like trendy electric indie pop garbage. Why did I believe this band was any good in the first place? Their name is so pretentious it makes me throw up in my mouth. You're better off listening to Nine Inch Nails, at least they know how to bring it."
1,"Cheap plastic, broke.","I had this knife for about a year, used it on maybe 20 dives. On my 20th dive i had it on my leg like usual, and all of a sudden the plastic just crumbled and broke into pieces and off came the knife. I was at my safety stop so i did not retrieve it, not sure if it was worth the effort if i did have air to spare.only good thing about this knife is it was pretty sharp, and worked somewhat well until it crumbled into pieces.I think if this knife was put into a different sheath it would be great."
5,more than cheese from netherlands,"I heard the song ""rain"" once and I fell in love with this band. The leadsingers voice is amazing and the songs are very honest. Kane is definitely the proof that there is more than cheese from Holland. The sound is great and it's one of these CD's that you can listen to forever."
5,One of my Heyer favorites,"I've read most of Georgette Heyer's books and this one along with the Grand Sophy are my two favorites. The hero is thrust into the role of heir to a disagreeable grandfather after the deaths of his uncle and cousin. He is ordered to the family estate to be whipped into shape but what follows is part mystery, part romance and a great deal of fun as 'Ajax' surprises everyone."
5,Great Ending!,"This is another Georgette Heyer novel worth a read. It starts out a bit slow, but the ending is soooo worth the wait! I laugh every time I read it. If you like books or movies where everything comes together, ridiculously, at the end - definitely read this one!"
3,Not her best,"I love Georgette Heyer, but this is not one of her better books. Seemed very contrived and disjointed. Even the ""hero"" was unbelievable."
3,Not Heyer's best,"Im sorry to say this because I love Heyer's books but it started out slow. The characters were somewhat interesting, Im glad to say that it did pick up towards the end. She has far better books then this but it was no way a horrible book."
4,The unknown Ajax,I have read this book several times. I like the way Heyer writes and her characters. The hero is thoughtful and has a great sense of humor. I like the girl as well. Heyer writes strong women into a time when they were considered chattel.
5,An entertaining tale of misconceptions and mystery.,"The blurb is about as accurate as the Darracot assumptions about the son of their black sheep, Hugo Darracot. The heir, a ""weaver's brat,"" and totally unknown to his noble (and debt-ridden) family, has newly sold out from the army and is ordered to present himself to his tartar of a grandfather for review.Received by his relations, this ""unlettered rustic"" decides to see how far he can take their preconceptions.The romance? Well, how romantic to be ordered by your grandfather to marry your cousin to get both of you off his hands before you can cause any embarrassment.This one is pure Heyer, funny, witty, great dialogue, and clever twists abound. Her mystery writing skills are prominently displayed as well. A terrific cast of characters rounds out a satisfyingly robust plot."
5,A different kind of hero for Heyer,"Just when I was getting a little bit fatigued with Heyer's romantic heroes who are crusty, arrogant, and seemingly unavailable to women and love, along comes Ajax, whose real name is Hugo. He realizes when he first meets his boorish, domineering, and arrogant grandfather that he has made insulting assumptions about him -- that he's an uneducated and ungentlemanly oaf raised by a working class Yorkshire grandfather. Rather than set his family straight, he plays up to their assumptions, adopting a thick hick accent and an apparently open, humble, and agreeable manner. Great fun ensues as his real talents, character, and social position emerge. I very much enjoyed the change of pace as the love story was somewhat secondary to the central drama.I didn't find the bits of Yorkshire dialect offputting, as there wasn't much of it and it's clear from context what's being said. It must have been a lot of fun for Heyer to write, and I enjoyed reading it."
2,"Love her books, but WAY TOO EXPENSIVE HERE","Save your money. Go to your local used book store and get these books by GH for $.50 to $1.50 each. Love the books. Price is WAY, WAY TOO HIGH!"
3,No longer available by Dirt Devil,This filter was no longer on the dirt devil site. Will probably have to get rid of a perfectly good vacuum.
5,Great filter,I have an ancient Dirt Devil and this filter fits and works perfectly. Just as described and pictured.
5,Fabulous!!!!,"To use REAL SOAP is a joy that is difficult to explain. Rich... Moisturizing... Sublime... Real soap making is just beginning to catch on in the US. If you are using all the junk on the typical store shelves, do yourself a favor - try true, natural soap. You'll never go back - EVER! Doux is certainly a gold standard for natural soaps."
5,Reminds me of my trip to the South of France...,"When I was in Provence France, I bought several bars of mimosa soap at a small public market. After returning home and using the soap, I knew I had to find a source for this wonderful soap! I checked several sites on-line, but only Doux shea butter soaps looked like the bars I had purchased on that wonderful summer day... When I received the soap, I could not believe it was exactly like my French soap! The smell, the shape of the bar, the creamy lather. If you can't take a trip to France for soap, this site is the next best thing!"
3,"Great smell ,not long-lasting, NOT moisturizing","I got the doux soap in Jasmine scent .It had great smell , but it isn't long lasting. The size and shape of the bar is not user friendly.And it is pretty drying , not moisturizing at all.A little pricy for just the smell."
4,Pricey,"The soap was very nice, it lathered up wonderfully, had a pleasant smell, made my skin extra soft and lasted quite awhile (quite a large bar) however considering the price with the added shipping/handling, it would be much cheaper to just pick up something that is just as good, off the shelf at my local Walmart Supercenter."
4,"excellent, realistic characterization of colorful shakespearean figure.","This is a very funny, bawdy fictional ""autobiography"" of one of Shakespeare's most interesting characters. Very entertaining reading."
4,Level 42 Physical Presence,"I think this is the best Level 42 CD the band recorded live and just happens to be their first. Released in 1985, the tracks are from their earlier albums, but all excellent material and well done."
3,Better than keeping your salad in the plastic bag it came in.,"I guess I shouldn't have expected a miracle product, but it does work - kind of.We use 2 kinds of salad mix. A spring mix for our more gourmet salads and that mix keeps fabulously in the salad keeper bags. However, our more ordinary mix (iceberg, red cabbage, carrot) may last 2 days. Chances are we run out of it before it goes bad, but still... I think I could do as good with a rubbermaid container.I gave the item 3 stars because of the success with the one mix and because it arrived on time."
2,"Sorry to say,,,it was a bust.","Nothing to do with the seller. Product arrived on time and was well packaged...the product, on the other hand, sucks. Bought it to store lettuce but I did not realize I was buying a ""towel with a drawstring"". Could have made one myself...and, it pulled all the moisture out of my lettuce making the salad extremely dry and uneatable. My husband now uses it to transport his Ball Pythons since it wasn't worth the trouble to return it...back to my ziplock and paper towels."
1,Not worth the price.,This does not help anymore than putting the lettuce in a brown paper sack in the refridgerator. Definitly won't recommend this to anyone.
4,This is my second one,"I wore one salad sac out, and was delighted to find a replacement on line! I bought an extra, and that has proven a good move. It keeps my veges fresh and crisp much longer than any other method I have found. Great item!"
4,it works!,"i'm so happy to have the salad sac. no longer do i have problems with brown lettuce leaves when i don't eat them for oh, lets say 2-4 days!! i wash everything and i just put it right in the salad sac and it stays fresh.food will go bad eventually no matter what you have it in but it really does preserve your lettuce a lot longer then just keeping it in the plastic it came in.one thing i do have to say is that the outside of the bag can get very dirty. i would recommend 2 salad sacs. one that can go in the laundry and one that can stay in the ice box. so you can transfer the salad from the dirty bag into the clean one and just throw the dirty one in the washing machine and your good to go...its a good investment...better then throwing away brown lettuce because by throwing away brown lettuce your wasting time and money."
5,Perfect with Scones,"Only from England could come a product called "" clotted cream"" which sounds pretty awful and just tastes so good."
2,Disappointed Fan,"I have a lot of Steve's vinyl recordings and enjoy listening to them. For some reason, this CD recording seems to be under recorded and the only solution is to turn up the volume to listen. When compiling with other artists on a cd burner, the songs are noticably under recorded compared to the other songs. Otherwise, I enjoy listening to Steve sing. I just wish someone would re-issure ALL of Steve's vinyl records - that would be a blast!"
1,"new york, new york & a bunch of unknown songs","Steve Lawrence is a very good singer, almost as accomplished as his wife. This album is a loser. Except for New York, New york, there is not one familiar song. I learned a lesson. I would not have bought this if I'd have seen the selections in advance. They were not available when I ordered it. Save your money, buy something else by Eydie & Steve."
1,"Steve Lawrence ""bootleg""","This Cd is so bitterly disappointing. Featuring some of Steve Lawrence's best work but remastered in an appalling way. This is obviously ""pirate"" / ""bootleg"" material and not worth wasting your money on. I would not like to see the distributor benefit from sales of this dreadful product. I hope Steve Lawrence sues for misrepresentation of his talent. I have given it one star, but it deserves no stars at all!!! Michael@MDunnington.freeserve.co.uk"
5,A story that never leaves you,"When I was in seventh grade, my English class was one of all girls. My teacher looked high and low until she found a copy of this book and we read it all together. That was 9 years ago, and this story still haunts me. It was, without a doubt, a turning point my reading tastes. It opened me up to a whole new level and genre of books.It is beautifully written. The fact that it is true makes it all the more powerful. I can't tell you how pleased I am to find this book here as I, myself, have searched high and low for it. Grab it while you can, and be prepared to be swept away into this story."
5,Love Is a Wild Assault,"One of the librarians shared this book with me thinking that I might like it. I was so overcome by this book. If anyone thinks that they have it bad in life, I would recommend that they read this book. ""Love Is a Wild Assault"" has a certain charm. It's many adventures grab at your heart. I was impressed with the idea that this book was based on the life of a real person, a true Texas pioneer, and hero. I have read sections of this book to my children, written about it in my journal, and share it with my book buddies. It's unforgettable!"
4,Great honest book about strong women,"Is it possible to equally detest both feminists and purely decorative women? If your idea of the frontier woman is someone who overcomes both timidity and inselectivity, the lessons learned from this book will be monumental. Its basic thesis is that love must like all things be practical, because in loving the practical, we are loving the life that gives us consciousness. There's philosophy, frontier adventure, and the story of a woman determined to survive whatever life throws at her in this alternately whimsical, romantic, adventurous and violent book. It needs a better edit, and the style seems formal to our ears now, but the challenging sentence structures show us how much smarter people were even 50 years ago (attention modern humans: your civilization is dying and you're in denial). One could probably drop 100 pages of redundant experience and data from this book without losing a thing, but I'll take it as it is. A surprisingly good read."
4,An Inspiration,Harriet Page Potter is an inspiration to us all. She never forgot her grandmother's words. This book is an exciting read that left me wanting to know more about all the characters. I don't want to say more because it the twists and turns make the story so unforgetable.
5,Best Ever,My copy is old - bought while book was out of print at a used book store. One of the best books of any type I have read. You simply can't put it down and knowing it is all real makes it even better. Wish there was more about this family.
5,Love is a Wild Assult,Received a book in excellent condition and began reading. It held me from the first page to the last. I became Harriet in the book and cried when she did and laughed along with her. Sorry when the book ended. Such a wonderful book to loose yourself in and also educational.
5,One of the best!,"Having lived in Brazoria County for nearly 50 years I am very fimilar with the history of this area. The events in this book almost leap off the pages in vivid scenes of Columbia, Brazoria and Follet Island during the Texas war of Independence. This is one of my favorite stories of a brave, resourceful Texas pioneer woman."
5,Wonderful book!,"I read this book at the suggestion of a friend. I love history but this book helps you to live history. I could not put it down once I started reading. I have bought copies for several friends and relatives, even my teen age granddaughters. My hope is that they will read it when the time is right for them. They are 6th generation Texans and perhaps this will enforce in them the strength and courage of their ancestors.Love this book."
3,Instructions were skimpy,"This seems to help my tennis elbow, but the instructions on how to wear it were lacking in detail. I finally visited my doctor who had suggested the BandIt and he tightened it and rotated it around my arm so that I was wearing it properly."
3,It was okay!,It helped a bit while working.I had to keep adjusting a lil' just to get that one area that bothered me.It was okay.It worked better than some other products I've used.
5,Great product,"It is really nice elbow band. I honestly don't know if the magnet did help my tennis elbow, but the band has a good design to fit well. I would recommend to buy it if you are a super-sweaty guy. As the band does not make me feel any uncomfortableness even I perspire profusely during game."
2,MAGNETS,its my own fault really - for not reading that there were magnets in the arm band. My boyfriend has been suffering from golf elbow and Ithought this would help.. He's and electrician by trade and cant wear a magnet at work! do'h! I am curious to hear if this actually helped anyone.
3,Look Like A Tough Guy...,"The whole arm-band mentality is a bit much... when it's on your arm, it looks like you are trying to be part of some elitist vigilante activist movement. And while it does help most of the time, it becomes uncomfortable to wear during normal daily activity. They lead you to believe that the Velcro straps don't touch your skin, but they do, and it doesn't feel good, creating a sawing motion when moving arms in a normal fashion doing run of the mill tasks.It's difficult to get it set correctly...too tight and it cuts off circulation every time you bend your elbow. Too loose and it slides around and constantly needs to be re-adjusted. Had I done my homework, I might have chosen an altogether different product to aid in recuperating from my tennis elbow... and $24.99 is NOT a user-friendly price for this device, in my opinion."
3,Hard to rave about a medical device...,"I am sure that this product might help some individuals, however it didn't do much for my husband.It did, however lend some support to his arm."
4,tennis elbow helper,Happy with it. Gives me some support that I need while playing. Wear it off the tennis court to stimulate blood flow. I can't actually feel it happening but my tennis elbow has improved since using it.
4,Good high level overview of objectives.,"Has most of the critical info, but don't use this alone. You will need to supplement it with either the Sybex book, and ideally, the PMBOK.I have been a PM for 8 years. I used the books I mentioned, studied lightly each chapter using the CompTIA objectives and Sybex book as a primary indicator of the exam, and passed first try.Good luck on the exam!"
2,Disappointed,"This book is a good concise reference, but when you find 3 errors in the first 5 pages, you have to question if this is reliable study material. Publishers should have got better reviewers, especially for the test questions"
5,What a time saver!,"I was pleasantly surprised at how great this little book is. The answer key is correct now, and I passed the IT Project+ Exam because this book helped to make the weird CompTIA objectives make sense! Well worth the money, and it won't take long to read through the book and get great practice with the sample questions, which were very much like the real exam questions."
3,Quick and Consicse,"VERY quick overview of what you need. It's a helpful book, but I don't think it would be enough to pass the exam alone. Use it together with IT Project Management: On Track from Start to Finish and its a great combo."
2,Lots of Errors,"I found the book to be helpful in that it helped me to better understand the objectives. But the Practice Test Questions are WAY screwed up. It appears that many of the questions for each objective were cut short to make sure it would fit on one page. Also the questions don't match the answers in the back. For example, the questions for objective 1.1 has 5 questions, but the answer key lists the answers to 6 questions. In the same section, question #2 says to choose two answers, but only one is listed in the key. Objective 1.14 question #2 says to select two answers but 3 are listed in the answer key. What I also found troubling was that the phone numbers and email address to get support don't work. The emails are bogus and the phone numbers aren't reachable. If you are buying this book for the test questions - DON'T BUY IT. You will be disappointed. I would wait for the second edition."
4,Basic Information - Good for Quick Review,This short book outlines the basic information you will need to know to take the Project+ exam. It is good for a quick overview before you begin studying and a quick review before you take the exam. I would not recommend using this book as your only source when studying.
3,GOOD FILM,"LOOK THIZ FILM IS COOL, BUT IT NEEDS MORE URBAN ACTION AND SHIT, IF YOU WANT REAL GANGSTA FILMS WATCH MENACE II SOCIETY"
1,Boyz N' The hood.,"Powerful? In what way? Let's see Cockameny Radical Black REVISIONIST History(we all come from Africa,Yeah and Jesus is Black),Anti-Reagan/Bush(Why cause every social ill is somehow the White Man's Fault?)And then you got the little kid is mother drops him off at his Dad,Great example!Classic cause you have Cuba Gooding Jr(Great Actor) and you have Ice Cube Jheri Curl style.If anything the film goes to show what the Black Community has done to itself as stated at the start of the Black Community,Why is it Bill Cosby and Clarence Thomas,Thomas Sowell and Other Black Conservatives are ""sell outs""? and you have Race Baiters like ""Professor"" Cornel West,""Reverends"" Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton(Tawana Brawley anyone?)say they Represent the community? I am glad this movie got spoofed.you want something go get it yourself and stop blaming others."
1,"""Men Not Found In BoyZ""","""Boys N the Hood"" Staring Cuba Gooding Jr (Jerry Maguire) and Ice Cube (Friday,Next Friday) star in this flim about freinds growing up in South Centeral L.A. .With you tipical layout of gangbang flims. They have hard times growing up to be ""men"" and have even harder times as men ,they all but one dies at the end.Ok acting by all but overall poor writing in this flim sinks it.Just another 2 hours of life we will never get back ofter watching this poor movie. In The End ""Men Not Found In BoyZ"". Rated:R NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER 18."
4,Boys N The Hood - Excellent,Thanks for sending the DVD in a timely manner and in excellent condition.RegardsRose
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Well-acted, constructed, and directed, Boyz in da Hood is a powerful and moving look at the plight of inner-city black youth that makes a compelling thesis about the importance of fathers and builds towards a fitting conclusion."
4,Mr. Movie Maniac,"This is a movie I already owned , but a neighbor of mine wanted a copy,so I purchased one for him. The story relates very closely to events that have happened in real life. I highly recommend it."
3,BOYz N Da HOOD,this movie is a gangsta movie classic and a must have for any youth who grew up in the ninetys. it displays real street life growing up in south central LA and displays a very graphic tradgedy ending.
2,Tepid and deadeningly overlong,"There are no surprises here in this redundant dud about life in one of the most dangerous places in America, South Central. The characters here feel contrived and even unsympathetic, and the movie tries too hard (and fails) to shed light on a topic that everyone knows very well about."
5,The best urban crime movie!,"Ice Cube and Cuba Gooding, Jr. star in John Singleton's first story of three South Central adults: one a drug dealer; one looking for a football scholarship; and the other looking for better life, wondering if he will be a daddy. This movie is WAY too intense for younger children. If you never seen this yet, see it, you'll just love it! 4 Stars!"
5,Deep Ghetto Drama,"I thought where I live was bad, but compared to how Singleton described Long Beach, I was dead wrong. This movie is a great portrayal of life in one of America's toughest slums. If you live in Irvington, Plainfield, or Sparta NJ, check out this video. You'll see where we live aint that bad. I'm out."
3,a career deferred withers & dries,"john singleton was in hisearly 20s when he directed this movie and was supposed to become one of the great directors; unfortunately he has done nothing in the nearly 20 years since to justify that early bit of over-praise. what we DO have here is a good but uneven debut feature drawn from the experiences its creative team had lived thru in growing up in the LA ghetto, highlighted by solid acting turns by laurence fishburne, cuba gooding, and especially morris chestnut. like so much of the african-american community, singleton seems to be an artist of unfulfilled promise. sad."
4,Clear in its message as a cautionary tale,"Usually, I hate these kinds of films about ghettoes, gangsters, and guns because they tend to glorify the very things they are supposed to warn the kids against (Superfly, Belly, New Jack City, The Mack, Colors, ad nauseum). But this is different and a tad more realistic. No high rolling pimps or drug dealers with flashy cars and fine women here, just some confused, wrectheced, stupid kids who choose the wrong path (Ice Cube and co) compared to Cuba Gooding who is growing up with wise guidance. So there's no delusion of the youth here. Oh yeah, for those who are put off by Fishburne's conspiracy theories in the film, these were inspired largely by a series of lectures that Min. Louis Farrakhan was giving at the time that were widely circulated in tapes in the ghettoes in the early 90s. Writer/director John Singleton was at one such lecture when he met Ice Cube and talked about making this film."
5,One of the best shows of all time,"I have to admit I didn't even know this show existed till half way through the second season, but now i just can't get enough of this show. Everything that could be on so many T.V. shows is all put into this ONE sitcom. The actors and actreeses have some the greatest chemistry together. I have watched the first season way too much for my own good but that just proves how much I love this show. I am LITERALLY counitng the days down till the 2nd season is released"
2,"first half of the season let down, then picks up","season 1 was one of my favorite shows ever. very very funny, very original, superb main character in ""JD"", all that. now i am watching season 2 and its just gone. i've laughed twice in 4 episodes, while season one had me in stitches the entire time. its like they are repeating season 1, but without the jokes. the same people doing the exact same thing, even nice musical numbers thrown in, but it just ain't what it used to be. i strongly suggest not buying these dvds without at least sampling an episode. however, starting at around episoe 12 the show gets back in gear and while still not as great as the first season, it does become thoroughly enjoyable. this continues into season 3 which starts out great."
4,Easy Comedy,"Full of quirky characters, this show is a nice break from all the serious hospitals dramas out there. Enjoy a laugh, just don't take it too seriously!"
5,Extremly funny,You'll laugh untill you actually need medical assistance... and even so... you'll keep laughing
5,No review necessary...,"if you watch this show at all, you don't need to be talked into the DVD. It's worth every penny if you are a fan...otherwise you can always catch it in syndication now :)"
4,Hilarious,"Very good season, probably better than the first. If you like the sarcasm and out of left field comments by Dr. Cox, you will love it."
5,Bring it on!,"Like many people out there, I caught on to Scrubs during season two. Back in May I bought the season 1 set and it is without a doubt the best season package of the year. It's creative design on the DVD menus, discs, and packaging have yet to be rivaled and it is so packed with bonus features that it has set up nearly impossible standards. I have no doubt that season two will be just as phenomenal (but hopefully with better cover art) and I can't wait to see the episodes again. This is one of those TV shows that gets better as the years go on, not worse. I'm also extrememly happy with the quick turn-around time for release of the second season, thankfully we don't have to wait a whole year, and hopefully the other seasons will be released quickly also.(...)has all the info about bonus materials, if you're too anxious to wait for amazon.com to update."
2,More of a quick reference,"This isn't a book, the back of it even says ""This booklet"", although I'm not sure if it should even be called that. It has very limited information, most of it being geared towards someone who has never taken a spanish course (ever). Simple things like numbers and simple phrases are within but this would be useless if you were actually trying to converese with a spanish speaking patient."
1,Shame on you APhA!!!,"I definitely expected a more comprehensive and helpful publication from this organization. What a waste of money. As for the person who gave the overly positive review....they are either fiscally invested in the publication, or VERY culturally inexperienced,with little-to-no demand for Spanish communication or cultural literacy. Either that, or this person has VERY low standards for the counseling they provide!"
2,Essential Spanish for Pharmacists,"A good primer book, however, it lacks badly in the everyday communications with a growing number of Spanish, Spanglish and Mexican speaking clients, who present themselves at the Pharmacy window, with prescriptions they know nothing about, other than the fact that their doctor gave it to them to get filled."
2,Early expiration date,"I ordered a pack of a dozen 9V Duracell batteries from Blinq, and they arrived with a ""Best before"" date that was only seven months away. In my experience, Duracells bought locally or at other websites generally have ""Best before"" dates which are several years away. I'm not sure that I will be able to use all twelve of these within seven months, so I wish they were not so old."
4,So far so good,"I mean it's Duracell, need I say more. I placed them in my smoke detecors, no problems as yet. Hopefully I don't find out the hard way."
5,Love the stereo orchestra with Caruso's voice!,It is wonderful to have the modern sound of stereo orchestra to enhance Caruso's singing! I love all three of the cds which were produced in this series. It is too bad that they were not so well received so as to encourage the company from continuing the process with his entire series of recordingMost of the background distracting sounds from tjhe original recordings have thankfully been removed!
5,One of the best chess books ever writtern,I can't imagine why the publisher has let this book go out of print. It cannot have been that on one liked it. Possibly it didn't get the kind of advertising that it needed. It is certainly one of the most valuable books for learning the game that I have ever seen.
5,Best Ever!!!!,"This book is a great addition to any library or office. I use it in my law practice for quick and easy reference. If you own the 2003 edition, this one has been updated and is much easier to read."
1,No Information Is Bad News,"Charlie Rich by Charlie Rich (Audio CD - 2005)# Audio CD (October 18, 2005)# Number of Discs: 1# ASIN: B000BRQPG0Who knows what you're going to get.I simply ordered this mystery disc to see what I might get. I got Charlie Rich: 'Classic Rich' 2003 from Collectables Records. This is a 13 track CD with all the hits and a running time of 37:31.Classic Rich also comes with different song tracts and various lengths ranging from 10 to 14 tracks.I web searched and couldn't anything definitive. The ASIN: B000BRQPG0 number wasn't helpful either.I included a pic of the album I was sent."
3,Chalenging but Fun,Mario style character puzzel game. Quite interesting involing Monsters to help beat oppenents and get you to the key and out of the level. Very fun Multiplayer levels that you create. You should borrow it from a friend or rent it. Don't buy it.
1,A really dumb game,"I bought this game, played it, And didn't play it again. What you do is you control this little guy,and you Jump around the screen and collect items and stuff. You can also Make boxes out of thin air by pressing a button,or you can make them dissappear with the same button. Each level has a key you must collect to open the door to the next level. The are also little Monsters that you can kill by using the box appear thing on them. You can also collect 4 peices of pottery to contain a certain monster that will give you a special ability. It may sound good,but youhave to play it to belive me. If your planning on buying it,don't,Unless your a REALLY big Monster Rancher fan! Even if you are,you might not like it!"
3,"It's a little bit Lode Runner, and a little bit Pitfall.","The game is very similar in design to another classic game, Lode Runner -- in Monster Rancher Explorer, you're a tomb explorer who can drop and destroy crates with a simple wave of your hand. it has Dozens of puzzles, Battery save, and Link cable support for two players"
3,Cute but sounds aren't great.,I love the early learners series. I was excited about this book because my son is a year and really into pushing buttons. He thinks it'as pretty neat. The pictures are so cute. I would NOT recommend this particular book however because the sounds are not realistic. The dog and bee sound are especially loud and scratchy. The rain just sounds like static. I would suggest choosing another book if you're looking for one with noises.
5,excelente,"Este floral cura todos os transtornos no ouvido, cura o Zumbido, trabalha a integridade, traz o equilíbrio para as pessoas, tratamento para as inseguranas, o humor instável, a irritabilidade, vertigens, tontura, cura as oscilaoes e indefinies. Obrigada Eliza"
1,Flimsy,"Just rec'd, very disappointed. It's flimsy and looks cheap. The interior light makes part of the roof glow and part of the walls glow - looks ridiculous. Don't buy. I'm sending it back."
2,see the other entry for CDA-9856,Search for the other entry for this product (Alpine CDA-9856) on this Amazon site for reviews.
4,An oldie but a goodie,"One cannot help but wonder how could a book, written Western German journalist, and former German veteran of EF, be described as ""Soviet propaganda"". It has very interesting observations on the mentality of German society of the time, specifically need to suppress memories of the crimes committed in the USSR by German Army."
2,Mostly Soviet Propaganda but shouldn't we study that too?,"Do not look here for anything new,unless you have never heard the Stalin era accounts of the fall of Berlin. Yes the author does add some lines here and there that are not politburo approved but that does not make it a good read. I must add I was looking for info on the last stand of the Wehrmacht from the Russian MILITARY side (read viewpiont),not the press corps. As it was I only bought an old softcover thinking I may be disappointed. I recommend doing the same. If you have plenty of time you may find a tidbit to add to your knowledge or treat it as a way of practicing ""find the party line"""
3,Poor production value,"I am not a spanish speaker, so perhaps that influences this review. The music (asside from the singing) on this album is poorly done. It sounds like someone sat down with a synthesizer and drum rythm kit and just played the songs. It seems to lack a certain depth that a high production album would have. The singing (by children) is fine, of course; it sounds like kids singing. Because it is a group, the words aren't as clear as I would like. It is inexpensive, so it is worth the money, but it isn't wonderful."
3,"Very upbeat CD, but no lyrics!","I bought this because I really enjoyed the ""Juguemos a Cantar"" CD. This one is also a lot of fun. I just wish it had printed lyrics. My toddler likes the upbeat songs and enjoys dancing to the beat!"
2,Just OK - you get what you pay for,"Watch band is very large and cannot be made smaller. Voice is not very loud, so not too good for an older person who also has a slight hearing problem."
4,Great stuff for anyone who lives in or visits New York,"Skip the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty! Mittelbach and Crewdson know their stuff and their share it in all the fun and interesting details you could want. This is the ""big apple"" down to the core. I used to live in New York and was excited when this book came out."
2,Not a winner!,"My almost-5-year-old daughter is terrified of the toy. The spinner makes a super-loud whirring noise, and the doll itself is loud when spinning. Very limited play value, as you can't position the doll or change clothes. Cute idea, but just didn't work for us."
2,Just Okay,We got the Lacey doll for my daughter because this is her favorite little princess. Not quite sure why they made these like they did. I figured they would be battery operated because they required batteries. This is just so that it can be wound up as a top and then put on the floor. The motor is really loud and you take it off the stand and they spin for about 30 seconds and fall over. I think my husband and the Grandparents had more fun playing with this than my daughter on Christmas. Needless to say it hasn't been touched since Christmas morning. Very cute little doll they just didn't do a lot of planning on these.
5,Adorable!,"I agree with the reviewer that says read the directions, these are so cute. We just purchased all 3 from e-bay since they are sold out everywhere and my daughter loves them!!! They must be used on a hard surface no carpet but then they just dance like a top. Very clever :)"
5,This is an excellent toy!!!!!!!!,"it is alot of fun to play with, especially when you have all 3. When you have all 3 spinning on the floor, you can move them with your finger and they look like they are gliding, and you can cause all 3 to spin together, glide together, they look like they are dancing. My daughter is 12 years of age and she loves them. You can be creative with these dolls, like make a puppet show, add a little excitement to playing with these dolls. You should not pay more than $10.00 for each doll."
4,Fun Toy!,"It is important to read the directions with this one! The dolls don't dance on the stand like the twins. The stand ""charges"" them up to spin like tops. On a hard floor, we have been able to get the dolls to spin for over a minute. My 5 year old loves these and can easily charge them up herself. One downside - keep the dresses on! The big plastic ""skirt"" makes it very difficult to redress the dolls."
3,"Suspense and intrigue, with a glimpse into a bygone era","Mary Roberts Rinehart remains the reigning queen and creator of the ""had-I-but-known"" school of mystery. ""The Album"" is typical of her writing and a well-plotted story. Told by a narrator, Louisa Hall, she recounts the drama as it unfolded for her. Rineheart gives almost all the clues needed to solve the mystery, but there is always one fact kept from Louisa, and therefore from the reader. ""The Album"" is classic Rinehart, with a detailed plot and fully-developed characters. The heroine is a young, unmarried woman who, naturally, develops a strong love interest. She lives in an era of innocence and is actively involved in solving a mysterious string of murders in her wealthy neighborhood, while trying to ensure her own safety. Particularly of interest are the vivid descriptions of life among the affluent in a by-gone era. As a good, solid read and a record of times past, this mystery will satisfy."
4,"Pretty close, not quite perfect","This fits four adult tlife jackets in a handy case. The construction is nothing special, but is adequate for the job.I took off one star because it lacks grommets in the bottom for drainage.It is going on a boat.... so it is going to get wet, and with no drain holes you will have a bag full of water and moldy life jackets.I'll pop a couple of grommets in the bottom of mine rather than send it back."
4,Aussie crime escapade,"Peter Talbot, City whizz-kid, desperately needs 100,000 to cover his high-finance fiddles. In prison on a driving charge, he meets Dawes, an Aussie who know the mining industry there, and hatches an audacious plot to recoup his losses.This being Garve the Australian scenes are completely authentic and convincing.There's a dramatic denouement in an australian mine."
1,Many-told tales,"A severely disappointing compendium of many-told Mafia tales, all familiar to readers of books on organized crime.Probably the best example of what I'm talking about is the ""revelation"" another reviewer mentioned -- the pressure on Albert Ruddy and Francis Ford Coppola (not ""Martin Scorsese""--one heck of a goof) to not use the word ""Mafia"" in the movie ""The Godfather."" Just look on the Internet and you can see that is old stuff that has been repeated many time since the movie came out. Anyone familiar with mob lore would know that.So don't believe all the hype by friends of the author and people unfamiliar with the genre. This book just isn't worth the money. If you are like me and buy every Mafia book that comes out -- don't."
4,The Mafia's Comeuppance,"Great detail ... too much to consume, yet so complete. How dedicated crime-fighting personnel! Didn't know how pervasive the Mafia was."
4,Five families,I wanted to learn about the 5 NYC families. This history is outstanding. Very informative and detailed. I highly recommend this book.
4,Best All-In-One,"I found this book to be the best, comprehensive book on Mob information.The dealer that shipped, Goodwill, is THE BEST; fast, taking care, and their books are actually in BETTER shape than they say."
5,Interesting and Accurate,I've read about half the book and I enjoy it very much. It's the best book I've read on this topic from a complete historical and objective perspective.
3,Familiar reading - lots of this on TV,"I borrowed this book from the local library after watching the cable TV show, ""Mobsters"". After reading the book, I found that most of the show ""Mobsters"" was lifted directly from this book. Also, I found that I knew most of this material as I have previously read lots of books about the Mafia and have watched numerous documentaries about the mob. The only new part I did not know was the history of Anthony Casso and the later mobster, Jim Massino. Nevertheless, the book is a good overall history of the NY mob. It's told well and the reading is good. My only disappointment was being already versed on what Raab had to say. (Not his fault!) However, I think this book is a good primer for anyone remotely interested in the mafia and the history of how the mafia began. In the end, Raab's book is strictly for beginners, not someone who has lots of knowledge about the current mob."
4,One of the best;however---,"The book is all right for anyone that doesn't know much about the history of the Mafia.Steve Fox book is much better;""Blood and Power"".When I saw that Raab was the author,I expected much more.But it's mostly just rehashing of other books and newspaper articles.Try Gus Russo's ""the Outfit"".Mostly about the Chicago Outfit,but a good example of what Raabs book could have been."
5,I don't do many reviews...,"Like I said, I don't do many reviews.But when it comes to this book, how could you not?This is the DEFINITIVE history of the Italian mob in the US.It's massive, huge, indepth and surprisingly enough...the pages fly by.Highly enjoyable and highly recommended."
4,Unknown Talents,"along with Franco Morone, Peter Finger, Antonio Forcione, Larry Coryell (there's a name you recognize), Jacques Stotzem performed at the All Star Guitar Night in Anaheim in 2001. I am really glad to see Amazon handling some of their recordings; these are some amazingly talented guitarists. Unfortunately, there are no samples so far and, honestly, I don't own anything by them because of the difficulty in getting their recordings (mostly found in Europe). But my memory of their playing that night brings me to offer you this review.In a nutshell, get something by any of these artists and you won't be disappointed."
3,Handles,"The handles are not what it looks like from the picture. the handle is heavy. The length is great. I don't mind the handles though, it would be good for boxing training. Go to the titleboxing website to see what the handles actually look like. There are two kinds of images. Look for the ones with color orange, blue, and black. They show the actual image of what you will get."
5,Backstreet Mom: A Mothers Tale of Backstreet Boy AJ MccLeans .....,I purchased this book because Im a collector of anything involving the Backstreet Boys who are my favorite band and I loved the book!
1,Backstreet Mom,"This is pathetic! WASTE OF MONEY; out of over 200 pages, only 9 are related to A.J.'s actual drug intervention and treatment. Mostly just about Mommy Dearest and how hard she worked for A.J. DON'T BUY IT...."
5,Excellent book,This book really is insightful and gives you a real look at the dealings of the music business. It shows you how hard Backstreet Boys worked overseas only to find out they weren't making any money and that a group exactly like them(N SYNC) was being built behind their backs.It also gives you an insider's look into AJ's problems and addictions and how they first came to be and what lead to them. I would reccommend to this book to everyone especially parents with children who want to be in the music business or those children themselves.
3,A good read but...,"Focusses a lot more on her and her work for the group than I'd have liked, but overall good.She provides a no-holds-barred look at Alex's decline as an addict, her own denial of his addictions, his manipulative behaviour (same as any addict's), his rock bottom, and his struggle to recover.It's a bit unclear if it covers only his first recovery or if it covers his relapse and second recovery as well which is frustrating.Definitately a must read for any die-hard BSB or Alex Mclean fan though!"
2,No help at all for an Italian Wedding,"This Cd has nothing at all to do with an Italian wedding. I can't believe they can market it as such. Save your money, even if it was cheap (we fell for it too!)The songs are canned and bad remakes of the original"
1,Absolutely did not work for my daughter's wedding,"I wish I had read the reviews on this page before I spent the money ordering this CD. As the other reviewers wisely said, the songs are just poor remakes of some Italian American hits. No originality and really NOTHING that makes it appropriate for an Italian wedding. Save your money, brides and grooms. This is a rip-off, even though the price looks good.Reviewer, Waterbury Conn."
1,Not to be recommended,"This is definitely not a CD anyone could use for an Italian wedding. It was obviously mass produced and hastily put together. The songs are badly recorded and, above all, there is no life in the music. And you need life to pull off an Italian wedding successfully without a live band. Thumbs down."
1,This CD is a rip off. . .save your money,"When my husband and I went on a search for Italian wedding music for our reception, we bought several CDs with ""Italian Wedding"" in the name. This one had to be one of the biggest rip-offs. The few songs on the CD were terrible.... It was a total waste of money. Wish we had read the reviews before we bought it."
3,"All in one place, but still falls short","Although the information you'll need to apply to veterinary schools in the United States can easily be found on each of the school's web sites as well as at the American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges website (...), this book is convenient because it outlines the important information for each school including what criteria schools look at, statistics for the previous classes, what tests you'll need, as well as other important information. Although the most accurate and up-to-date information can still be found online, this book is a nice reference. My only complaint is that it was not released until a month into the application process. If you don't already know what schools you're applying to and what tests you'll need to take, you won't know until it's too late if you wait for this book to hit the shelves."
4,Flows well,"Rotring has good inks and makes really nice pens. I prefer the broad weight ink best for writing. These particular cartridges are hard to find now so was glad to find them on Amazon. Just wish the ink lasted longer and cost less because it seems so ridiculous to spend so much on ink. The price you pay for high end pens, isn't it?!"
2,Major Dissapointment,"I was very excited to get this game because I thought last years version was outstanding. The graphics in this years version are incredible, unfortunately the game play is not. Getting to collect a loose puck is time consuming after skating circles around the puck which is right at your feet. Your teammates' player AI is terrible and you might as well not ever try to pass out with the goaltender as most passes miss intended receivers and go directly to the other team. Ref interference is also idiotic. Keep last years version or wait to see if nhl2004 is actually good."
4,Great!!!,"This is a great SIMULATION hockey game. If you want to knock people down and fight try NHL Hitz which is also great. NHL 2004 is also a good game but 2003's stupid comments during gameplay really nailed the coffin shut on that series for me. ESPN NHL Hockey is my game. It is a true to life thing. You can send players to the minors and change your line-ups, trade players, change your defensive and offensive strategy's during the game. It's a awesome SIMULATION I cant stress that enough. Pick this game up if you get the chance. GO NASHVILLE PREDATORS!"
4,AWESOME!!!,I got this as a christmas gift and was amazed at the game quality. The graphics are awesome. My dad walked into the room on Christmas while i was playing and asked if my home team was playing. If you dont look closely you may think its an actual hockey game on ESPN.
1,A great disapointment,"I am so pissed I bought this piece of garbage. Sega still doesn't get the concept of making the levels gradually more difficult. instead Im treated with NHL HITZ type play. Or I get smoked. There are things to unlock as well, like jerseys and teams which is cool but, No Hartford Whalers love? Very sad, Considering every other team that has existed is represented in some form. Unlocking things can be a chore though, and it does take a while. Good points include the Air hockey feature in the skybox. Outstanding graphics but that's about it Deeking is difficult.Fighting is worthless, jerky and almost worth skipping altogether. Kind of like this game. For it's few good points it has about 5 bad ones that pop up. This game just sucks."
2,Don't buy if looking to play online...........,"It's been a while since the online play has worked correctly. The gameplay itself is great. By far the best available, but SEGA needs to get their network fixed."
5,Awsome Game,"This game is not like any other hockey game. The slapshots are really good. When you play this game, you will enjoy it a lot.There is lots of different things to choose from.The player detail is awsome! It almost looks real! Get this game quickly before they sell out of stock!"
3,Mixed feelings,"First I was aggravated that I had to return it because the wholes for the screws were uneven and wouldn't fit so I decided to drive to the store where I ordered it from to exchange it. I'm not too sure what to say about this item. It's very clever for people who don't have much room but need a desk. It's very simple but looks good. The only problem is that it's flimsy but since all I do is use my computer (and most of us that's all we do at our desks these days), it's not much of a problem. It was good enough to keep but too cheap to give as a gift."
2,wish i'd known what kind of pictures were in the book,"when i saw the book cover, i immediately thought the book would be a great father's day gift for my daughter to give my husband. when the book arrived, i was surprised to see that on each page, there was a naked dad with a naked baby. i found it to be a little distasteful, and i was frustrated that nowhere in the amazon book description was it mentioned that the book contained nude dad/baby pictures. while some might find the book fascinating and sweet, i wish i'd had more information on the book before purchasing it. if i had, i wouldn't have bought it."
5,The Joy Of Fatherhood,"This book is visually stunning. While looking at the photographs I found myself smiling, laughing, and yes, even wiping a tear from my eye. The photos of the fathers and their babies touches the heart. The brief text that accompanies each picture tells about that fathers hopes and dreams for his child. This is the type of book I'll pick up over and over again, not only because of the wonderful photographs, but because it is so uplifting."
5,Wonderful Book!,"I must Say, that this book is among my ""most used"" books. I read it often because it holds so very many Answers to things that I question, or have that troubles me, or a dear friend, or my Son.The ""healing"" procedures Absolutely WORK (for me). They have, on several occassions that I would have had to ""have stiches"", otherwise!Also, the connections it ""opens up"" with other beings (and matter) and their Energies, on this Planet, and beyond, are nothing short of Fantastic. You will surely notice a stronger connection with all Animals as a result of reading this book.I ""Identify"" with the ""Merlin Falcoln"", on the cover of the book. I see one ""visit"", flying above my head, or my car, or nearby, just ""watching"" me. ....Life is so Incredible!"
5,Excellent teaching for intuition,"Serge King's ""Urban Shaman"" had very needed wisdom teachings to strengthen the ""iNtuition"" component of my ""INFP"" Jungian Myers-Brigs Type Indicator, thus helping fill out my being, in ways that standard education did not do. This book's teaching is in a very open communication form, thankfully no mysteriousness, and in plain up-front mode, with many easy exercises to get practiced experience with the many useful intuition principles he presents to the reader. This book, along with many other Serge King's writings, is finally helping fill in my existence as the whole being I was born to be, as a INFP type person. Each new piece of my being thus added, increases my sense of peace within my world. And, look at all those interesting things that I had been missing before! Thanks, Serge, for creating this teaching. Jim"
5,Urban Shaman,"King really impressed me with the sincerity and simplicity of this book. He gives a short introduction to Kahuna followed by many tangible exercises to further the integration of this practice. He really hits home with the idea that our connection to Spirit, and to nature, is within. And, we can connect with our Spiritual beingness wherever and whenever we please. All power is within. Beauty is within our grasp.Spirit Journeys: Freeing the Soul in this Life and Beyond,Healing Thoughts: Applying Therapeutic Shamanism in Your Daily Life"
5,Outstanding Book!,"This is an extremely well written book full of excellent material and techniques. I cannot recommend it enough! Easy to read, but thorough in covering the subjects. I found it a joy to read."
2,Not real,"Legitimate indigenous spirituality is out there, but Huna is a farce. Max Freedom Long created it in 1930 after teaching in Hawai'i and making a study of the language after being ignored by all the shamans. This is re-packaged New Age philosophy. It gets two stars for the writing, but there's nothing here."
5,asombroso,"a cualquier persona que tenga que ver con el diseño, la publicidad o simplemente con el arte, le producirá una profunda ""envidia"". Este excepcional creador trasciende la fotografía a otro nivel que va mucho más allá de lo estético. Sus fotos son un veradero manjar para cualquiera que trabaje con ideas."
2,A disappointment,"After I read ""Falling"" I couldn't wait to begin another one of Elizabeth Jane Howard's novels. I found this story boring and sluggish. None of the characters ever really came alive and wasn't sure where the story was going. This book was so dull that I couldn't be bothered to finish it."
2,"Wouldn't call the condition ""Good""","I bought this VHS to replace the same VHS I had purchased through Amazon a few years ago. The quality of the first purchase was REALLY bad and I couldn't really follow/use it because there were lines running down the screen throughout the whole tape. This one is better, but still not what I would call ""Good Condition"" as it has what resembles ""skip"" and/or ""streched-out tape"" in some parts. And I certainly don't think it was worth $15."
1,Would you like some cheese with that?,"The author makes up for all the whining about his failed relationship, how lonely he is, the jetboats on the quiet ""wilderness"" rivers, and how the Maoris got their land stolen from them (all of which may actually be true), by submitting the reader to weak metaphors, tiresome stereotypes (his and others) and exaggerations. In fact, the only reason I continued reading the book was to see if the author would break out of his (and my) depression by getting romantic with one of the two women he ran into on the trail. Unfortunately (for me and perhaps him, too) the sad tone continued to the end, and although the ending was poetic, it and the book, left me unimpressed and unfulfilled."
4,"I'm not a fan of travel writing, but ...","I found this to be an interesting book. If you want to learn all about New Zealand, its flora and fuana, or great ""tramps"" (hikes, for you and me), this isn't the book for you. However, it is an enjoyable light read, giving the reader interesting snapshots of life in NZ. Stevenson meets some interesting people along his journey and I found the way in which he shares their stories much more engaging than most of his descriptions of his walks in the woods. Yes, at times the book strains credulity and some of the characters may seem a bit cliche, but I, too, stood in wonder of many of the situations he encounters. Ultimately what comes through is that New Zealand is a land both unlike any other and exactly like home, too."
3,is there a genre problem here?,"As a travel book, Kiwi Tracks is hindered somewhat by the author's personal problems. He had ended a relationship prior to going on his journey and he keeps reflecting back on his solitude and loneliness. This sort of put a melancholy tone on what should have been an enjoyable trek. As a personal odyssey book, there didnt seem to be much spiritual growth. The specifics of the great NZ tracks were OK, and if one has been on a trek in NZ one would probably want to read this book and include it on his bookshelf. If, however, one has not been to NZ and would like to learn more about the tracks (""Just the facts, ma'am"") one would be better served by one of the hiking guides. For a more upbeat look at the country from a personal journey standpoint, the reader might want to keep an eye out in the used bookstores for Edward Kanze's ""Notes from New Zealand""."
2,Nitro Firestorm RTR for Rookies,"It is a cool car with a lot to be learned, honestly the RTR concept is not as easy as anyone can think since I've had this car since mid December 2009 and I haven't been able to run it as easy as I thought. You need to spend half the cost of the car on ""must-have"" accesories that are not included and there is no information available until you buy the car and read the manual. However, I'm excited since I'm motivated to learn about it and make it work as it is supposed to."
2,Not the best quality,"The zipper at the end always hangs out instead of wrapping in when you close it. The other book I have hides the zipper well, but this one sticks out and looks tacky."
3,"Love the case, but hasn't stood the test of time","I love having a case that can hold so many CDs, but after a couple of years, the pages have detached from the binding. I don't carry this around a lot, either. It's still useful, but a bit annoying."
5,Sturdy and looks good,"This product is pretty sturdy and looks good for the price I paid. It's a CD wallet so I don't expect that much, and it does the job."
3,"cheap quality, but cheap price when on sale","price was really low, but so was quality, compared to other brands i've bought."
4,Not bad for the price,"Pros: reasonable price, decent qualityCons: product is a bit cheaper than I anticipatedSummary: As some of the other reviewers mention, this product was a bit cheaper and more flimsy than I had anticipated. The inner vinyl pages are thin and not very sturdy but have not torn on me thus far (for 2 months now), and sometimes it's a bit difficult to slide CD/DVDs in easily. The outer fabric cover is very solid and protects the CD/DVDs inside very well. Overall, it's a pretty good buy for the money. I paid $5.99 after rebate and got free shipping, no tax. Can't really beat that. (Although you have to be careful about the rebate, you have to send it in within 14 days or something like that). I believe it goes on sale periodically.I think if I paid more than $15, I would be rather dissatisfied, but when they sweeten the deal, it ends up being quite nice. =)"
4,What you see is what you get!,"For the money you pay, it's an excellent buy! The zipper is loose ended on one side (have no idea why!) and if you're not careful you might rip the pockets but it's good enough for in-house use. I'd recommend it to my friends!"
4,Good value for the price,"The quality is not as good as my Fellows cd wallet that I purchased a couple of years ago, but for a fraction of the price of the Fellows I got a decent wallet with nearly three times the storage."
2,Disappointed,"The CDs slip out very easily - open it carefully, alwaysright side up (a little hard to determine at a glance).The zipper is rather awkward to use, you need two handsto open it (one to hold the long and loose zipper tape,one to pull the the zipper itself).I found it overpriced even at the sale price, though theCase Logic storage is an out and out rip-off. Still, athalf the price of the Case Logic notebooks, they are cheapstorage. Lord knows keeping CDs in the jewel cases takesup too much space: what's a boy to do?I doubt I'll buy any more of these, just the same."
5,Classic Movie!,As always ... Amazon delivers..... It came on time.... I just love ordering things from Amazon!Orders this because my son remembered watching it as a child and wanted his children to see. My grandchildren absolutely loved this movie... a must see for every little boy...
5,Old Yeller,"This has been a family classic years I loved watching it when I was younger, and now my children love to watch the show."
5,Great classics,"Having not seen either movie before, I wanted to watch them in succession. If you do, have your tissues ready!"
4,good movie,bought this for our grandson for christmas. I received it is good time. I'm sure he will enjoy it I loved it when I was a child.
4,WILL MAKE A GROWN MAN CRY -- A CLASSIC,"Disney's skill at repackaging and remarketing previous DVD titles brings us a double dog set: OLD YELLER/SAVAGE SAM (Disney).The much-loved Old Yeller (1957), the ultimate boy and dog love story that still makes grown men cry, looks better than ever. Besides the parcel of critters in the story, extras let us take a gander at what the kid stars look like now. And there's a fresh interview with Santa Barbara developer Fess ""Davy Crockett"" Parker.The rousing Savage Sam (1963), the lesser but terrific looking sequel, is what happens to the pups we met at the end of Old Yeller.

4,Old Yeller/Savage Sam,I really enjoyed watching both of these movies. I feel it is very important to expose them to some of the classics. What a nice expierience to watch these movies with them. I would say that Savage Sam was very good. I had never heard of this movie but I really did enjoy it. I would strongly recommend these movies to others.
5,yeller,My grand daughter loved this movie. She heard us talking about how her mother loved this movie and that her mother as a kid always rented this movie over and over again whenever we went to the video store.
5,Old Yeller,"I bought this movie for my brother for Christmas. He is 21 now, but loved this movie when he was younger and would watch it over and over. He was so happy to have it on dvd and has never seen the second one. It got her fast and was in great condition. Thank you."
5,Old Yeller,"This is a good old movie, and you get 2 for 1 that's great bargin. we haven't never seen Savage Sam but this gave us a chance to. I would recommend this DVD, to somebody who loves old movies."
5,great movie,This movie brings back memories of my younger years and now the kids had an opportunity to see it and love it as well
5,Great movie,3 yr.old grandson loves the movie and sings the song all the time. A classic movie and I recommended it for all ages.
1,It's sooo boring,This is such a boring book. It goes on and on about the killing of dogs and stuff. You fall asleep half way into the book. Don't read it whatever you do! I never even got pass the 3rd chapter before I gave up. It's soooooo boring.
1,if you like dogs don't read the book :(,"ok, so, this book in the beginning is sooo sad! , they beat the dogs! that is like the worst thing ever, the poor things, and even worse i had to watch the movie and see the dogs get beat, if you don't have to read it for school, seriously, don't read it"
1,THIS IS BAD BOOK,"THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. THE TEACHERS KNOW THAT IT IS BAD THEY JUST WANT US TO SUFFER THROUGH THIS DUMB BOOK. I AM A KID, AND I KNOW YOUR PROBABLY THINKING WHAT DOES HE KNOW BUT I'M NOT LYING. THIS BOOK IS VERY BAD. IT WAS VERY SUCCINT BUT STILL WAS A HORRIBLE BOOK. THE ACTION IS NON-DESCCRIPT, AND JUST PLAIN OLD BORING. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY TO BUY THIS BOOK. THE PERSON WHO WROTE THIS BORING BOOK HAD NOOOOO LIFE."
4,The Trout - or - La Truite,Amazon appears to have confused these two videos - I doubt that Ms. DuPre ever appeared as an actress in a French film - although she probably could have done so!
1,STEELERS JENGA,"I WILL NBVER KNOW! I ORDERED IT WHEN IT STATED AVAILABLITY, HOWEVER, THE SELLER LATER INFORMED ME THAT SUDDENLY IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE! IMAGINE THAT!I KNOW ONE THING, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER THING FROM THIS SELLERDIANE"
5,Great shoes.,"I bought these for my son at my husband's request. I was a little uncertain about getting slip-ons, but decided to give it a try. I was worried my son would be able to get them off easily. Fortunately, I was wrong. When we first got them, they were kinda hard to get on, but the more he wears them, the easier it becomes. I guess they needed to stretch a little! They still sit snugly on his feet, and he doesn't take them off. So, we're all happy! Oh, and they look adorable, too. That's always a plus! :-)"
3,It's OK to love Etta and not LOVE this recording.,"As many reviewers have stated, she speaks far more than she sings, and that is a disappointment from such a fine vocalist. She growls a lot, too. It's interesting to hear her interpretations of some unusual songs not normally in the blues repertoire. But the band is great. In fact, the band is the star of this recording.So if you love Etta, you'll probably enjoy this disc. But it really is far from her best work. If you're new to Etta, you'd be better off starting with some of her earlier recordings."
1,Disappointing!,"I am a huge Etta James fan, so I readily purchased this CD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed - her voice, although powerful, is flat and she speaks, rather than sings, many of the lyrics. At times, she sounds like the old Etta, especially on ""At Last"", but these moments are way too few to justify purchasing this CD."
2,Average at best,"She spends as much time talking the lyrics as she does actually singing on this live CD. If your looking for Etta at her best live then buy her CD ""Rocks the House""."
2,Fairly Average!,I have quite a few Albums by Etta James&Have Live Recordings of Her Back in the 60's&70's&this Set doesn't even Come Close to Her Earthy Raw SoulFul Self to Me overall.Her Band Has Moments&Her Voices shines in spots but overall can't really feel the Warmth&Depth in this Set.
2,Book Binding,"The content of this medical dictionary is ok, but the binding fell apart in less than a week of use."
2,"not useful for ""coders""","The book has useful information but it is ""user"" unfriendly from a ""medical coders"" point of view. It does not address the whole: ""prefix or suffix"" issues and is hard to use"
3,Scata chroma,"It looks better in the adds than in real.The way it is now,it works better with a black,grey or white backgrounds.But,considering the waiting period, not only in mailing but even to go & get it from their site,it doesn't worth a dime.It took me 17 days to receive it when it only takes 15 min.to drive.Reason:they don't even carry 1 in stock,they have to order it from another state."
1,"Christian praise musicians doing ""ethnic""","I have to say that, for all the study and admirable work that went into this project, I was rather stunned that Savae didn't understand how clearly unqualified they are to represent the style of this music. As another reviewer mentioned, they are unable to shed their operatic voices; I'd be even less generous and say that the slick, commercial style of a American Christian singer just doesn't cut it here. Beautiful music, embarassing performance. Perhaps you can submit these songs to Savina Yannatou or someone with a true mediterranean style so we can enjoy the fruits of your labor."
3,Ancient Echoes?,"The music on this CD is beautiful indeed. However, the purchaser must not be deceived into thinking this CD contains True Christian or Jewish content. On the contrary, the music is based in a mystic sect of Islam called Sufism. See www.abwoon.com. Please think carefully, if you are truly seeking Christ, before purchasing this CD."
4,A Good Book,This is a good book on Samba. But there are other good books on the subject too. This book has its place.
3,Need to read other books,"Although the book has good name on web pages and the introduction of micropressor M6809, however, I still have to read other books."
1,Mild Waste of Money,"I recieved my copy of The Driller Killer within only a few days of purchase. Great quality and great shipping. Problem is, a good ten minutes of this film, and two pretty big deaths, are blurred out totally in red. You can only hear what's going on. It's not a problem with the film, and I haven't read any other reports or reviews of this supposed to be in the movie, so If you're going to get this film, which isn't completely horrible, don't get this copy of it. You'll be missing out."
1,completely outdated software,"The software included with this dictionary was made in 1999. I'm not sure what the point of even including the CD-ROM is since it won't work on a lot of today's computers. I called the customer support number hoping there was an update and was told that there has never been an update and there isn't one planned. So unless you have to have this version for work (sadly, I do), don't waste your money on this when you could try something that uses THIS century's technology instead!"
2,Disappointed,My almost immediate reaction was one of great disappointment. The readability (not sure whether it's a font issue or not) and the lack of depth to the entries surprised me. My 40 year old America Heritage dictionary is superior in both regards. I relied on the user reviews more than I should have. Rereading some of those reviews again alerted me that too many were from people who were providing this dictionary to someone other than themselves. I wanted a reference book for my own use.
4,Excellent Dictionary,This is an excellent dictionary for journalists. It goes hand-in-hand with the Associated Press Style Manual.
1,A piece of crap!,"BEWARE! The disk in the copy I got will not even begin to install on Windows 7! I bought the product, because it was advertised as a 2004 edition and came with a disk. So fool that I am, I assumed that the disk was also produced in 2002 or later and included at least 32-bit software. Wrong! The copyright notice on the inside cover of the edition cites 2002, but the files on the disk were produced in 1996.I'm sure that I will have some words with Amazon about the product.On the other hand, the book, advertised by a reseller as in acceptable condition, appeared to be brand new."
2,Webster's New World College Dictionary,"The true i didn't like this dictionary, it doesn't have all the words that i am looking for, but well i already buy it, but i think the writer of this book, could give more information on the meaning of the words and more examples, i think if they write this advices for me they will get better."
3,Watch out on this item,I purchased this dictionary from Caiman and there is supposed to be a CD with it. They never sent it to me and when I complained they asked me to send it back. I want the CD not a refund. It is a nice dictionary and I would love to have the computer version for my laptop.
4,Love it!,"""Very clear, informative,and customer friendly."" These words are likely to be heard when talking about Webster's New World College Dictionary. This dictionary is is designed to meet of of it's customer's and user's needs and it surely does! This book has been very helpful to me. Thanks Michael E. Agnes and staff!"
4,A useful reference tool,What can I say about a dictionary? So far it has the words I want to know about. It's quite up to date regarding the Internet and related words.
3,Warning: This dictionary may not be your best choice!,"The Webster's New World College Dictionary, 4th Edition, is not the best choice for a comprehensive and definitive collegiate dictionary.Please review the Merriam-Websters Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition, before making a decision regarding the purchase of a dictionary.The Merriam-Websters Dictionary, with an included cd-rom of its contents, is far superior in the number of entries and definitions to the Webster's New World College Dictionary."
3,Very Average,The print in this book is a bit on the pale side and it is surprising how often the word I want is not in this dictionary. I much prefer The New Oxford American Dictionary.
2,Be Forewarned,"I just want to put forward two facts. 1) This is not the Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (now in it's eleventh edition), and 2) it is not published by Merriam-Webster. If you want a simple basic dictionary it may be fine. This dictionary has pictures and half as many words as Merriam-Webster's Collegiate 11th edition. If you are a college student/graduate or a serious user of the english language, this will probably not suffice. It irritates me that the makers of this dictionary (complete down to the red and blue cover) attempt to construe themselves as a collegiate dictionary."
3,Nice Dictionary but..,"I had to get a hard back dictionary for my Eng 101 class for a vocabulary project and found that the definitions weren't lengthy enough for complete understanding. I got tired of looking up synonyms, but the CD-ROM is very useful."
5,Webster's New World College Dictionary 4th Edition,"Good dictionary, tons of words, thorough and comprehendable definitions, good resources in the back. Can't go wrong with this dictionary. It is being used by 13 and 14 yo's and mom and dad as well!"
1,A poor reference guide,"I bought this dictionary because it had received some good reviews. However, I must say that I am extremely disappointed and would not recommend its purchase to anyone. Every dictionary that I have ever used has divided the word it is defining into its correct syllables and then given the words' definiton. Well, not this one. My son was looking up words for a homework assignment and had to find the word ""vegetable"" and write down the amount of syllables it contained. This dictionary lists vegetable like this --> ""veg-eta-ble"". First, I thought it was an error. After all, who divides vegetable like that? As I did some further research, I soon realized that the dictionary does not bother to list the words and their syllables. Well, what I need is a complete dictionary, not some joke of one..."
2,Anything goes.,"I have found my old edition of the dictionary less than satisfactory. It accepts pronounciations such as ""nucular"" as ""nonstand"" simply because it is used by some not too literate politicians. A dictionary that elevates ignorance to ""nonstand"" is, in my opinion, not trustworthy. Perhaps the newest edition is more reliable."
4,User friendly,This is an easy to use dictionary. I possess a copy and just recently bought a copy for one of our kids in college.
5,Good price,This is an excellent deal on this dictionary. I was very excited to get something I needed for work at such a reasonable price.
4,"Dictionary terrific, CD-ROM not","The dictionary is terrific, but the CD-ROM does not work with my Apple Operating System. I am sure the CD-ROM is as good, but can't use it with my Mac."
4,Good Dictionary,"This is what we were looking for in a dictionary. It has most enteries we wanted. We enjoy the pictures that are in it. Our only concern is that the print is a little small as we are older and our eyes are not as good as they once were, but it is still very usable."
4,Mr Entertainer,As always a pleasure to listen to whether in my car or just on my own at home. My collection of his music is growing.
1,Not very helpful.,"This is no more than a long vocabulary list. It is not a dictionary in the usual sense given that the definitions are short and often inadequate. One good thing this book has going for it is the transliteration of the farsi into english to help with pronunciation. If you have a good knowledge of how Farsi sounds, don't bother getting this book. If you don't, the transliteration might make it worth the price."
3,"Sufficient to some, inadequate to others","If you are a student of Modern Persian, then this dictionary should suffice for a while. But if you are a native speaker and need a broad English-Persian dictionary, this is not for you. Also, native speakers who need a dictionary to help them in college will not find this dictionary adequate by any stretch of imagination."
3,Where this particular dictionary shines ...,"Gilani's dictionary is very straight forward: English verb, two or three suggested Persian translations, and a phonetic transliteration into English. No examples. No indication on what the verb's present stem is or how various prepositions are used with respect to the verb. So as an overall dictionary reference Gilani's work is a bit weak. But this reference work shines in two areas though. The phonetic transliteration is very close to the common everyday colloquial pronounciation. The Aryanpur-Kashani dictionary for instance does list vocalizations but they are often quite far off from how a word is typically pronounced in the major metropolitan areas of Iran. Also the suggested Persian translations are dead on. Very current and modern. Useful for translating the news or dialogues. Not very useful for translating literary works or anything with flowery language."
4,Technical Terms Need Definitions,"I like this dictionary and it is highly understandable and effective. Nonetheless, the Persian definition of some terms are missing. Allow me to randomly present a few missing (1) technical and (2) historical words: ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS, LINEAR ALGEBRA, CAPACITOR, RESISTOR, ACHAEMENIDS, XERXES, ARTAXERXES, CAMBYSES, ALEXANDER, et cetera. If I visited a university in Iran, I could obtain the meanings of these terms; however, one buys a reference book to obviate running around for answers. Furthermore, it would be nice if the author added a list of common Iranian names.On the whole, I found this English-Persian dictionary very useful but good things can be superseded by better things."
5,The Brain Diet: the Connection Between Nutrition...,"Best money I ever spent! I have ADHD and after taking Adderall, among other drugs, I decided to go the natural route and just try feeding my brain right. This book helped me to achieve that. (apology for the grammatical errors, I am studying Medicinal & Biological Chemistry, so my grammar and spelling are definitely not up to par)."
4,he sells vitamins!,"I didn't realize that he actually has a product line that he recommends in his book. This book is however a great resource and starting point in learning about what nutrients can help with depression. Fish oil and broccoli, baby!"
4,Good information but...,"The positives of this book have been well documented in other reviews. It is easy-to-read and provides useful and fascinating information regarding the relationship between diet and brain health. My two objections are: (1) There is no index. With a book with this content and information, I find this a big inconvenience. (2) The book is not footnoted. References are given using only journal year and year of publication, but article titles and authors are not provided."
5,It Has You Covered,The author of the Brain Diet tells you exactly which foods to eat to greatly improve you brain health. His assertions are backed by many conclusive scientific studies that he cites in the text and gives their sources. He also describes in detail what happens to the brain when it lacks the prescribed nutrition plan and how the plan corrects those problems. This book leaves no unaswered questions. It covers the subject completly and can not fail to accurately inform and benefit the reader.
5,SIZE DIMENSIONS OF SEAT CUSHION,"I saw the review from the customer who wanted to know the size. I saw this cushion advertised in another magazine and it had the dimensions.Seat Cushion is: 14 X 17 X 3"". Take note it was selling for more money in the other magazine."
3,Still Faking It,Mr. Minkow was accruately presented in Joe Domnick's book as a slick salesman for an unlikely business: carpet cleaning. Minkow eventually lost millions of unsuspecting investor's money. Domanick exposes Minkow as perpratrating one of the worst fruads of the 1980s. A good book for people interested in how crooked CEOs steal our invested funds.
1,For Beginners Only,"Never felt the need to submit a review -- before this book. This is the lightest science related text I have bought. (Did the other review sway me? Probably.) This translated-from-Russian text includes vintage Russian illustrations, which are amusing on their own, but the actual science is so very shallow. It's not enough to rehash the standard scenarios that tweak our everyday experience -- Einstein revealed a subtlety to the theories of Galileo and Newton that went unappreciated for centuries. Perhaps too much to expect from 65 pages..."
4,Good product!,"Seems to work fine, definitely helps when backing or traveling by eliminating blind spots. Went with 4 stars cause it shakes when at speed."
5,great mirror,"love this when i back my boat and helps with blind spots on hwy..You may need a kit to ""brace it"" so it doesn't shake/bounce when driving, I bought one at the my local auto parts house but i believe they offer them at Amazon...you will need the one that extends from your windshield to the back of this mirror to brace it if you plan to use it in a truck or car the end brackets just aren't enough"
3,Not for me...,"I thought I'd try this game, but if I have to spend more than a few minutes learning the button control scheme it becomes work, so I quickly shelved it. Maybe I'll give it away, but I only paid a penny plus S&H;, so whatever.It looks like it would be great if I ever care to learn the controls..."
2,Ummm ERRR?!,"The game has a few bugs in it. There were times when it announced the right score, but the numbers were posted for the wrong teams and vise versa. AND!!!!! I was forced to play 7 games for the championship because the software kept switching the scores. Though I won all 7 games, according to the game, I only won 3."
1,BAD GAME,"EPSN NBA BASKETBALL IS ONE THE WORST SPORTS GAMES IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAYING. WHEN I WAS PLAYING THE GAME, I HAD A HARD TIME TO PRESS MY BUTTONS TO PLAY. I BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAPPEN TO WHO HAVE PLAYED THE GAME. THE GAMEPLAY IS THE WORST, SAME AS THE PREVIOUS VERSION. THE GRAPHICS IS BAD TOO. THANK GOD I RENTED THE GAME FROM BLOCKBUSTER TO PREVENT FROM RIPPING OFF. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY A REAL QUALITY BASKETBALL GAME, TRY NBA LIVE 2004. I HEARD THAT IT'S PRETTY COOL. I AM NOT TRYING TO PROMOTE EA SPORTS TO YOU. BUT IF YOU HAD PLAYED NBA LIVE 2003, YOU KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING."
1,This game sux!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dont waste ur money...Sega cant compete with Easports at all. The graphics are terrible, the camera angles r horrid, the isomotion mode causes u 2 charge in2 the defender 9 times out of 10, and the i cant reli figure out hw 2 change the length of the quaters. Nba live isnt perfect but it is certainly better than this game. the only reason y i gave this game even 1 star was because it reli looks like an espn game and the nightly wrap up thing is pretty cool. This is a waste of 50 bucks! I havent tried the 24/7 mode but i hate how its in real time. i dont play ever second of life so how am i goin 2 accomplish nything in this mode?!?!?!?!? Overall this game is something u dont want 2 have spent $50 on."
1,Horrid,"I'm not sure where to begin with this deadful game.I played Live 04 and was pleased, great graphics, easy to control, however this simulation stats and rating attributes were upsetting. So I bought ESPN, and man, am I upset. The graphics on this game are not too far up from Dwouble Dwibble. The game play and camera angles are the worst I have ever seen and the player motions and animation are Horrid (except in the instant replay which gamers never use)! I tried to bring this game back but wasn't able to because I already opened it. Nothing will please me more than to burn it, which I am about toi do now. If you are all about simulations without playing a game than this is for you. However if you love actually playing games - DO NOT buy this game. Oh yeah, EBX changed its policy and it is now impossible to bring back a game, so once you have it, your stuck."
5,ESPN Makes It New,ESPN has done well with other games considering football and hockey this year basketball will be as good as them also. Nba live 2004 has the same graphics and dribbling style it's like a repeat of 2003. 2K4 will show improvments of every play like a new game mode called 24/7 You get to create you'r own baller and make his statics better as you play. If you'r thinking of getting a realistic basketball game make it this one instead.
4,EA SHORT IT'S KIND OF LAME,ESPN the world wide leader in sports.I love espn2K4 and now that it's july I still find myself playing through a franchise.The crossover moves are only difficult when you have a poor ballhandler.Live 2004 freestyle is in my opinion just about the same.You can get pass by using the crossover button instead of the right analog.The camera angles could've had a zoom though.The only problem is the easy competition I go 82-0 in a season that's almost impossible.I've had close calls but that's about it the 24/7 is great once you have earned enogh points your stats will stay the same if you don't play.24/7 can be difficult but practice makes perfect and going head to head with a legend can be tough if your attributes are crap.Overall this game is better than NBA live to me and I'm waiting for 2K5. I really hope ESPN add another difficulty level I need the opponents to bring their A+ game!!!!!!!!
5,ESPN NBA Basketball,"I recieved this game today and enjoyed the many different basketball games it provides. I plan to learn more over the weekend. This game was clear, no scratches and will take some getting use to (for me). I also ordered the Backyard Basketball and found that game to help me to play this game because of the Basketball level(s)."
4,The best so far,I think this is the best basketball game in 2004. ESPN is awesome. I love the graphics. I love the 24/7 mode. I love the street mode. It's clear to see that this is the best sports game so far. :)
3,High camp!,"Good campy fun from schlockmeister David DeCoteau. ""Leeches!"" plays like a classic grade-z horror movie from the1950's, complete with corny dialogue, bad acting and rubber monsters. This one shows a little more gore and a lot more skin, but otherwise it's a dead ringer. What a hoot!"
2,Still Not The Worst...,"Ok, the ""leeches"" are rubber leech-gloves on someone's hands, the swimteam is a collection of non-descript male models who cannot act or afford shirts, and the females are utterly useless. Yes, the plot is imbecilic and the dialogue is horrific. Still, I've seen worse. I have seen FRANKENSTEIN ISLAND, my choice for the movie most worthy of total annihilation! So, LEECHES is only painful, not deadly! However, that doesn't mean it's any good either! This is a movie you would only share w/ someone you hate..."
2,"WOW, Giant Leeches........Attacking Pretty Boys?","Hoo-Boy, did I dial a wrong number with this one! I saw this at the video store and thought that this would be great, campy fun. It is fun in spots, but Leeches is way too gay to be ignored.Its not an all male cast, Leeches does have three good looking hoochie actresses in it, and there is enough gore on screen, but there are just too, too many scenes with guys in speedos taking showers...SHEESH! I guess if you are into that sort of thing then this film would get a 4 star rating but I am not, so I take away two.It reminds me alot of Jeepers Creepers 2, another fairly good horror film loaded with scenes of bare-chested young men. I guess that there is a market for this sort of horror film."
2,Stinker,"If you like young nubile male bodies in speedos, you may want to see this film, otherwise, boy is it a stinker, it's not funny bad, just bad"
3,GOOD AND NOT FORGOTTEN,"This movie was a little corny, but entertaining and never boring. The actor who played the coach did not do a good job of acting. I think the word ""OVERKILL"" best describes his performance. The ending was a total surprise. I never thought it was conceivable.I would not call this a gay movie though. The fact that the director is gay, seems to be emphasized in all of his movies. The leeches were a bit 70s-ish. The actors did not do their best work when the leeches were sucking them dry. The movie is a fresh departure from the normal slasher flick. Not the best, but just a good movie."
1,Disappointed,"This movie needs a serious steroid boost on creativity, believability, and budget. AND can we say... just squish the leeches already. Not worth your time."
3,Creepy Crawly Fun,"This is latest film from DavidDeCotau- the director of ""The Brotherhood"" and ""Voodo Academy"". The story cocerns a college swim team who is using steroids to improve their performance and end creating monster size leeches. The movie is an old fashion creature feauture but in the DeCoatau tradition feautures a cast of cute young men. The leeches attack are effectibly gruesome- so if you have a taste for speedo clad lads and monsters- this is for you."
5,Excellent widescreen transfer,"This is a nice addition to director David DeCoteau's collection of homoerotic horror films. It sports a much better DVD transfer than the films in his Brotherhood series. Nice and sharp, no obvious artifacts. Its widescreen letterbox."
5,Be the talk of the town,In a nutshell you just might be the only person in the world with one of these. That in itself is worth the purchase price.
1,complete JUNK,This item was a total piece of JUNK! It came defective..... I could not believe AMAZON sold this item? It was made of recycled cans.....
2,Collecting dust..,"I bought this product about a year ago. Within 6 months of using the product, the auxiliary cable started going out. It didn't take long thereafter for it to just stop functioning altogether. The sound quality is relatively adequate for the price I paid (<$35). Most similar products in a close price range will produce the same sound.I did purchase the speakers due to their aesthetic value. When I realized the AUX cable came attached to the subwoofer, I figured the speakers could still be used on their own. However, they fail to function apart from the rest of the unit.Now, the product is sitting on a shelf, collecting dust, waiting for the day when they will either be thrown out, or repaired.Oh, and don't pay more than 40 bucks for them, if you ARE going to buy them."
3,Great product for the price,"If you compare this to more expensive products you may be disappointed, but you will be hard pressed to find something as good in this price range. Good looks, sound quality is fine for PC or TV use just leave the bass on full. This is not a Bose, but you didn't spend $300 either. Wish it had a remote for volume control."
2,better than nothing,"This bra is comfortable enough, and just supportive enough not to be completely embarrassing. The materials are pretty crappy. After less than a month I was starting to see the edges starting to run. I was happy to find a nursing bra in 42L (don't have any options at this size), but I can't wait to be finished nursing so I can go back to a sturdy, supportive bra.The straps look somewhat wide, but under load they end up bunching up and digging in more than others. Keep trying Fancee Free, maybe some day you'll figure out that the same designs and fabrics just don't scale up the same when you get into bigger cup sizes. I look forward to the day when a large size bra is actually designed and built for the large size bust. Someone let me know when they do, this one just doesn't cut it."
5,Great product for the fuller figure,"I have just brought this bra and I only brought one as I am 35 weeks pregnant and was not sure which one to get. I have tried this one for a couple of days 44E and followed the recommendations to get a cup size bigger.I think this bra is great, but we will have to see about the engorgement phase. I definately plan on getting some more.. but not sure if I need to get a cup size bigger for the engorgement phase. It is certainly very comfortable and fits great, with a little extra space, it will fit great when the milk comes in. I would recommend this product for the women who needs extra support, as I have none and havent had since I was 14 years old, so this bra is great for that."
1,Disappointed,"I was really excited when I saw this bra online in my size,but unfortunately when the bra came it did not fit like the picture. It was uncomfortable and had absolutely no support....my breast looked like sandwiches"
4,Average nursing bra,"I like this bra because I'm full figured. However it did not give me the lift that I desired. Its fits very well. Also, its great for sleeping and wearing around the house."
1,Very Itchy!,This bra provides ok support. It's not the best and not the worst that I have found. It is extremely itchy! I even tried trimming the lace off but it's not the lace. It is the fabric around the inside edge. I am not sure what type of fabric it is but it definitely is not cotton! When I took this bra off after wearing for a few hours my skin was red and very irritated around the edges of the bra. The cup fit ok and inside seams didn't bother me. It is one of the few that I have found in my size 38/40 H but there are others out there. Unfortunately I was not able to return this because I prewashed and had to wear it because I didn't have another nursing bra.
5,The ONLY bra that worked for me!,"I spent well over one hundred dollars trying to find a nursing bra that was supportive enough for my new larger bust size. I was a 40DD during my pregnancy & a 40G after my milk came in. This is the only bra I found that I feel comfortable leaving my house wearing! Not only does it give me a very flattering shape, it is so comfortable to wear. I'm buying a second one because I love it so much & I would recommend it to every nursing mom."
4,Best for around the house!,"I bought my first two of these when my first daughter was born in 2010 and LOVED them! They didn't flatten out my breasts like a lot of the plus-size nursing bra's. I wear a 42H and so I need a little more support then the average person. However I didn't feel they gave me enough support to wear outside of the house, so these are strictly my at home bra's. The third one I bought, when I had my second daughter this past year had some issues. It started to rip on the right cup and has pretty much fallen apart, not sure what that is all about. I never had any issue with the seam across the nipple area, as when I had both my girls I leaked so bad for the first few months that I had nursing pads on and by the time I didn't need to wear them anymore my nipple's wear toughened up! I am purchasing another one to replace my current one and hoping the same thing doesn't happen."
2,Smaller than most my other bras,"Seems to run smaller than labeled. My other bras of the same label size are larger than this one... so I haven't been wearing it, and can't rate the wear-ability of it."
4,Great bra,"I ordered this bra just trying to find one in my size. I am so glad I did. It fits well, is very supportive, and is comfortable."
4,Offshore Investing in the Tax-Free World,"I found Offshore Investing to be a helpful guide to legally investing in the tax-free world. The book thoroughly covers various aspects of investing outside of the U.S., including setting up trusts, choosing a location, how to select a bank, and setting up your account. A detailed discussion of how to establish an offshore business and a description of possible offshore locations will help potential investors make some difficult choices. Author Scott Smathers strongly recommends that investors seek professional help when setting up offshore trusts."
4,"Not exactly miraculous, but pretty darn good.","I got these and wore them to my rehearsal dinner and for my wedding - I was wearing non-traditional, but fairly slinky dresses, and I have to say they were comfortable and made a noticeable difference. And did I mention comfortable? They won't work miracles, but they do make one look a bit sleeker without weirdo bulges everywhere and aren't as constricting as other shapers I've tried."
2,not worth the price,It doesn't do anything for the tummy! It does work for the butt and thighs but I was hoping for a lot more!
2,Ok....,"Spanx ended up tearing on me the first time i used them, i got two pairs of them too. Smoothes well but rolls down on the stomach part too. Gets annoying"
3,Eh,"Good support, but it's not very smooth, and I find more delicate dresses may cling to the product as you walk/ride up. I wont be purchasing another."
2,Not so good.. not so bad,Well lets start off with the good. This product is very comfortable not to mention they are very thin very comfortable. The problem is that they don't really do anything for my stomach in perticular I am not big at all I am a normal size girl. The thing is that they actually create tummy rolls for me which is odd. I mean it does not slim me at all. It is good though for the reason i bought them which was so that i can wear them under skirts. They are very thin and cover all so i like that aspect about them.
3,works well but not for me,unfortunately the legs were too long for one of my skirts and I could see the leg lines through my pants. They did slim me down though.
4,okay,"After several purchases, I'm beginning to feel that the extra $$$ for Spanx is not worth it. I think I'll stick to Flexees."
2,Spanx,"The product is good and durable. Unfortunately, the sizingis all off. I purchased a size that was way over my weightyet I had a difficult time getting is on and felt like I waswearing a girdle. I suggest you get the next size up. I wishI had."
2,Work great when not rolling down,"I bought the Spanx shorts to wear under my wedding dress and when standing this product is great. However, as soon as I sit down they start rolling down. I bought Spanx because I heard that they didn't roll -- but they do. They fit pretty comfortably and I definitely feel strapped in but the rolling is pretty bad."
5,Spanx is what's up!!!,Thank you Amazon and the company called Spanx.For 30 something years I have been a faithful Spanx Girl. It is one of the best products on the market and I will never be without them.
3,Glorified panty hose topper plus size runs small,"I tried one pair of the Spanx Power Panties (I ordered two pairs) and discovered the Spanx looked like a glorified panty hose. Yup. They reminded me of the girdle-type panty hose toppers. I also discovered the Spanx run a bit small as I ordered the size suggested using the Amazon size chart. I should have gone up one size.I'd suggest saving your money and buying a pair of girdle-type panty hose. They are cheaper and if you are wearing the panty hose for their girdle power they'll last a long time.I'm sending the second pair back, and would have sent both, except when I was attempting to try on the first pair the Spanx panty snagged. Not fair to send it back to the seller, so I will keep the Spanx Power Panty; and squeeze into it when needed.Recommend with caveats given."
4,Nice.. but Tight,I ordered the right size.. and while I do like the spanx I just feel like they are a bit too tight. Over all thought does what it is suppose to do with out any lines.
4,Does what it's suppose to do!,"Love them. They do not roll like some others do. Also, you don't feel like your putting on a wet bathing suit."
4,"Hides pantie lines, smoothes skin","great for hiding pantie lines and smoothing skin. can be worn under dresses, white pants or jeans! great!"
3,Torso matters! short or tall waisted?,"Love product,does hold tummy in, & smoothes it all out.If you have a long torso,[long-waisted] these would be great!short waists they DO roll down.I did figure a solution to problem, pull them down further, put waistband were undies go,or pull up higher & fold under bra.These both work great,unless you want to wear a mini skirt/dress,but NO more fiddling!"
2,AVOID purchasing this product from BREAKOUT BRAS store,"LOVE the spanx however I have purchased this item from Breakout bras store, they have an Extremely poor customer service, first I have received a defected spanx (a whole in the leg) and then they replaced back the item after 5 weeks which this involved couple of times phoning& emailing the customer service , which I wasN'T happy as I needed the spanx asap,so AVOID purchasing this product from BREAKOUT bras store."
2,Spanx didn't work for me,The Spanx Power Panties with tummy control didn't work for me. They would either starting rolling down in the front or the back. They we're easy to put on and they felt great unlike the other tummy control items I have tried. But like the rest they started rolling down. It was either have a bludge in the front or the back. I really wanted these to work like others I read reviews about. But I only wasted my money.
4,Still won't make your butt look like the picture...,but it is an improvement. Despite the struggle to get these on (follow the directions on the package!) they are actually comfortable and make me feel less self conscience. I enjoy wearing skirts now because half way through the day my thighs aren't sweaty and sticky. That's reason enough to wear them. Not sure if I'll ever put on a dress or skirt again without putting a pair of Spanx on first.
1,doesn't work,"I'm 5'6"", 155lbs. This doesn't work for me at all. The waistband keeps rolling down the whole time i was trying to wear it, plus it was extremely uncomfortable."
2,Its OK,I bought this item about 3 months ago. It works fine around the legs except mine rolls up.I didnt like the tummy control though.Im short so it goes up really high so then I have the bulge in the back because its mashed everything up so all my fat is on my back now.Also its really really HOT!!!
2,definitely below expectations on my wedding day!,"OK I had a lot of hope in this product: could not quite lose the 10 more pounds that would have made my wedding dress look perfect. Size 12 trying to look like a size 10. I would have settled for something in between, but the way these worked on me was to push some of the lower belly fat UP making me look truely worse than if I had just left myself alone. Now I have to say they are amazingly comfortable and if I had gotten the ones that go up to my chest I might have been happier. Oh yes, and THEY DEFINITELY ROLLED when I sat down which was irritating at my reception. Good luck with whatever you do..."
4,no panty lines,I liked the spanx but I recommend going up a size. I don't like to see panty lines and this really helps with that.
2,Spanx,They are okay however the waistband keeps rolling so not really what I am looking for as it bunches up at waist and not a smooth look like I thought it would be.
3,panties,I put it on for 1 minute and have not put them on since. I feel the size is not true to size but I am in the process of loosing weight so I am sure after I loose some weight they will fit.
3,what were they thinking,"I understand that you have to have a seam somewhere in a garment, and it probably would make clothes look worse on the hip, but the seam going over the tummy looks horrible on garments, that you want your tummy hidden. Maybe it is just my pair, but you can totally see the seam over the tummy. I want that area to be smooth. Grrrrrr."
5,It is what you'd expect,It is just as described. I personally think you should order one size larger than suggested because they are otherwise insanely tight.
5,These babies fit,"They fit, nice and warm too, these cold old winter days. Keeps everything all buttoned up, ladies. Buy with confidence."
2,Received wrong color.,"Received incorrect color - ordered bare, got black. Flying out for a wedding in two days - really disappointed, will have to head to the mall anyways. What a pain! Won't be buying from this seller again."
1,not happy in ca.,"This product description is deceiving, does not do as described. sent a e mail to the company and they DID NOT RESPOND"
1,Do not waste your money!!,"Bought a pair hate them.Uncomfortable, roll at waist, hard to get on and off."
2,Not what I expect from Spanx.,"I carefully chose the correct size as shown on the chart. These ""power panties"" didn't hold in anything more than regular underwear. Also the top kept rolling down. very uncomfortable. I can't return them because I wore them or they would be going back. A total waste of $30. Very disappointed. The second star is because the fabric was light and unfortunately too freeing."
3,Spanx Power Panties,"Eh, so so. Wore them to work, they work fine, and smooth out any lines or bumps. However, I'm a bit disappointed in the material. Expecting more of a shiny, silky, lycra spandex material. They are actually more rough type of a material, similar to cotton tights."
2,"Waist is too low, shows bulges at top and often rolls over","I have both this product and the high-waisted mid-thigh shaper, and the high-waisted shaper is a *significantly* better product. Perhaps it may be due to my long torso, but the power panty is honestly too short in the waist. Whenever I wear it, my bulges all show above the waistline of the power panty, and after a while the top starts rolling down, creating even more bulges. Overall, this does not work at all. Buy the high-waisted mid-thigh shaper instead!!"
5,Spanx Panties,"I love my spanx and will order other styles. Very comfortable, even in warm weather. I fit better in my clothes without a tummy bulge."
3,"So, I think it is like this.","From what I can tell about Spanx, is that they only work if your overweight. If you are normal/small and just want to jiggle less, then it doesn't really do much of anything. Wearing a tight tanktop under your shirts, probably would do the same thing."
2,Disappointed- mixed feelings,"SPANX POWER PANTIESPositive: eliminates VPL (visible panty-lines) They are comfortable. It feels like putting two pantyhose together.Negative: They didn't slim my tummy, thighs, hips or rear. I'm 5'6"" ~131 pounds, size B. I'm a pear shape. Seems to provide some light control. I would achieve the same results with a pair of Lycra or with a pantyhose.Spanx size chart was accurate."
2,not too impressed,"I ordered this product and easily fit within the size i bought. I find that the product rolls down regularly and does not stay in place. It does control the ""muffin top"" but not for long before it moves. i would not buy another item like this."
2,Don't waste your money!,"Bought a pair of these after reading all the ""rave reviews"" on Amazon. What a waste of $30! First of all, these things are no more than glorified control top nylons. Secondly, was a little unsure about the size, so did my best guess. I'm assuming I need a size smaller, but won't waste anymore money. In The Mood Intimates, the company these shipped from, refused any refund or exchange because the packaging was disturbed, well DUH, had to try them on. Was really unhappy with their services. The legs of these rolled up. They were tight and uncomfortable. They did tuck my tummy in SLIGHTLY, but because they are an extra layer of fabric, made my favorite jeans TIGHTER. Don't listen to these reviews. Wearing these for more than 2 hours is torture, and mine were even a little BIG. Can't imagine squeezing into anything smaller........"
3,Just Okay.,"Kind of have mixed feelings with this product. It is okay, just okay nothing special. It does not roll up or down, stays put but I am glad I bought it on ebay for 9.99. Could have done without it though. I very highly recommend Sassybax. It is fantastic!"
3,The Canadian Queen of Easy Listening!,"Long before Anne Murray earned honors for her role as singer or vocalist, she came out with an album. The compact disc has noteworthy songs in there. She has a great voice, easy going, and pleasant to listen too in the car. It's almost country music or contemporary. She pronounces the syllables carefully and the price was a bargain. Anne Murray has been one of the leading female vocalists of our time but she doesn't get the attention that she deserves."
4,Nice Acoustic Guitar Album,"A nice collection of acoustic guitar pieces recorded between 1992-1994 featuring some of the leading acoustic guitar players, including John Renbourn, Peter Finger, Pierre Bensusan, Woody Mann, Tim Sparks and others. As far as I can tell from the album, only the Woody Mann cuts are available elsewhere. While all the playing is great, I deducted one star due to the relative sameness of the styles presented. It blends together very well, but there isn't much variation in style. All the cuts are instrumental. If you are a fan of the individual artists on the CD, you'll enjoy the album. Most of the album features studio, not live, cuts."
2,Disappointing.........and here's why,"McConville's study is a survey of maritime economics, presenting a general survey of macroeconomics as it applies specifically to the merchant trade. It is nicely organized and put together, but suffers from one serious fault: THE NEED FOR AN EDITOR!! The book is rife with spelling errors and grammatical mistakes or all sorts. There are entire paragraphs that are literally incomprehensible because the publisher did not comb the text carefully for faults and messy construction. If you want a superb study of maritime economics, get a copy of Shopford's classic survey (now in its third edition.......)."
4,"Outstanding Book on ADO,","with one flaw - the index is consistently off by a page or three. (a corrected index is available at apress.com)And, there is one caveat - this is NOT a book for the VB/database beginner. If you're just starting VB6 database programming, I would recommend Freeze's ""Visual Basic 6 Database Programming Bible,"" instead.If you can live with the fact that you need to subtract a couple of pages from the page number in the index, then this book provides outstanding technical coverage of ADO. Now, it appears that Rob used ADO v2.5 for the code used in the book, and there have been some improvements to ADO (it is now at v2.8) which make a few of the timing comparisons, within ado now a bit obsolete. (some recordset operations are now more efficient than they were with v2.5, for instance,) but it this book is still my first, and usually only reference that I need to pull off the bookshelf."
3,Catastrophically disfigured index,This would be an exceptional piece of work if it hadn't been badly damaged by an index whose references seem consistenly to be off by two or three pages. As a result it's good as a tutorial but almost useless as a reference work.
3,"Useful, but somewhat confusing at times","McDonald definitely knows what he is talking about when writing about ADO. Unfortunately, he has difficulty communicating that knowledge to someone who is starting out. His chapters on recordsets are generally quite useful. To set up my connection to the database I was using, however, I had to refer to other sources. His chapter on explicit connections is confusing, with a convoluted style.His index is also incomplete. For instance, the expression DSN (Data Source Name) is found nowhere in either the index or glossary, despite its importance and use throughout the book. I found that many references to the index simply didn't exist.If you already have a beginner's grasp of ADO and VB, the book is quite useful. If you're just starting out, however, look for some other source."
4,Needed Contribution,"This book concentrates on the views of the Iyyun Circle. This group of Kabbalists is mentioned briefly by other authors (e.g. Gershom Scholem). This book provides far more information on the circle and on their views. It's still not deep enough IMHO, and probably is worth 3.5 stars. But, since I haven't found a better book on this topic, I rounded it up to 4. The Iyyun Circle certainly has an important place in the history of Kabbalah though it wasn't Safed. This is a mid-level type Kabbalah book, IMO--far more important than the many introductory books on the market, but it is more specialized."
2,THESE ARE MID-1980s RE-RECORDINGS,"These are not the original 1960s versions. If you want the classic recordings, buy a Petula CD on BMG, Hip-O/Universal or Sanctuary/Castle."
3,Voice volume not very good,"All in all it's an average machine. But the built-in voice amplifier is simply awful. You can't hear anyone singing, even after throttling the voice volume up full blast. I had to take out my old guitar amp to get decent power. I do not recommend."
1,useless,"I do not recommend this machine. The music volume is nice and loud, and I like that the lyrics show on the TV, but you cannot hear the microphone AT ALL; so how is that karaoke? You might as well just sing along to the cd player. We actually exchanged the first one we bought, thinking it was defective or the microphone was broken. When the second one had the same problem, we realized that's just the way it is. Not what we wanted at all!"
4,Covers most of the area,This splashmat is very light-weight but of good quality to protect your floor. We have carpet in our dining area and so far nothing has penetrated. The colors and design are fun. It is easy to shake off and fold away for the next meal. I have washed it in the washing machine when needed and it has retained its shape and colors well. I definitely recommend this product. I just wish it covered a little bit larger area. My 14-month old's food occasionally ends up beyond its reach.
2,tends to bunch up,"This is not my favorite splashmat. It's too lightweight and tends to bunch up under the high chair. You want a sturdy, easy to clean, non mobile splashmat. It was easy to clean by throwing in the washer. I can probably use it for something else."
5,I think they're great!,"A lot of these reviews complain about it being too thin, but the great thing about it being thin is that it is easily transportable, you can iron it, shake it off, and use it as a tablecloth, art mat, or baking mat for when the kids grow out of their spillmats. The other great thing about it being thin is that it is entirely machine-washable, and you can tumble-dry them and they dry super quick.I'm biased because my mom created Mimi the Sardine, but I've been using her products for over 20 years (she designed her first product, a bib, for me) and think that the fabric, which is ORGANIC (none of the sugarbooger stuff is), is super versatile and durable and cute."
1,Does not stay in place,"I was seduced by the adorable design of this product and even after reading the mixed reviews decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the product is way too thin and does not stay in place. Also, I fold up the high chair after each use and the material of the mat doesn't allow for the high chair to slide open and shut.It's on it's way back to Amazon."
4,Cute and good quality,"This is a great little splat mat - bright colors, and nice fabric - would buy again. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was due to the lack of finishing edge - it's simply a 42"" square piece of coated cotton - I thought for the price it would at least have a sewn/stitched or finished edge (to help add a bit of weight to the edge to keep it in place better). We're using it for under my sons' painting area, so it's fine, but wish the edges had a bit more weight to help hold it in place."
1,Doesn't work the way we had hoped,"We had a plastic mat underneath our high chair for the first two years for our daughter... It was very useful, the only downside being that it wasn't that attractive and things sometimes got under it. All in all it was fine and we replaced it because it was getting worn out, and we thought we would get something more attractive and fun.Enter the Splashmat - we put it under the high chair and gave it a go - but we expected it to be a little tougher and thicker so that we could move a chair on it without it bunching up, and that it would stay flat. It does not stay flat - Every time we pull the chair in and out it bunches up and wrinkles. Though we can straighten it out, it requires constant attention and re-laying. Not what we needed, and we have stopped using it and folded it away to use for picnics or as a beach throw, we guess. It's pretty and probably would be good for that, but fails as a under table mat to keep things clean."
3,Pattern obscures food!,"Love the mat, but the pattern makes it hard to see food that is dropped on it.For wiping up the messes get the sugarbooger splash mat, it's much thicker, and soother. This one washes well in the washing machine!"
1,hate it,"it's small, it has porous surface, impossible to clean. total waste of money. We do 95% of things organic for our kid (including clothes and most of the toys) so I ordered this mat...stupid idea, really whoever let the kid eat food off a mat...don't buy it, this is just another company going overboard with unnecessary organic products, and I was stupid enough to fall for it. not worth it, not worth the money."
5,Cheryl Sawyer never lets me down!,"I read this book after having read both ""Siren"" and ""Code of Love."" I really didn't think anything could get better than ""Code of Love,"" and expected a let down...boy was I wrong! ""The Chase"" is fabulous as well. Sawyer once again creates two strong, compassionate, realistic characters that leap out of each page. I made the mistake of starting this book while I was taking final exams and let's just say that I lost a lot of precious study time because I could not put it down! Another winner from Cheryl Sawyer! I can't wait until her new book comes out in April."
5,5 STARS,"Under the Cover Book Reviews: ""It is difficult to put into words just how powerful this story is. Suffice to say it will be a keeper. Readers will want to buy one for themselves and others for gifts. Brava, Ms. Hatcher!"""
5,True Forgiveness,A great story of God's great love and forgiveness in very difficult circumstances. A compelling read and challenging life lesson.
5,Your heart will not be able to put this book down.,"The Forgiving Hour is a fast paced story that draws you right into the character's joy and pain. Though a good deal of the story is told in flashback, you can easily identify with Claire, Sara and Dakota. It's touching without being too preachy."
4,TIMELY READ WONDERFUL REMINDER!,"Hatcher gives readers an opportunity to discover the giving and receiving of forgiveness through this powerful novel. Dakota is a man faced with a dilemma, unlike anything I ever have personnaly encountered, and yet the character is wonderfully portrayed in such a manner that you cannot help but sense his despair. The reader will sympathize with some characters, get angry with others and rejoice in the culmination of The Forgiving Hour. Thanks Robin!"
4,good gun,"I had to write about this since there were no reviews. I bought this a few days ago and just had a chance to use it. When it 1st arrived I thought that I just wasted $30 on a cheap spray gun. It comes covered in oil and looks really cheap.After using it this is what I found. The cup is ok; the lid doesn't screw on right but does stay on. It does a great job of spraying, but if you don't know anything about spraying it doesn't comes with any instructions so you have to play around a bit. The wrench that it comes with is crap just through it out. The tip that it comes installed with is really hard to get off, I had to clamp the gun to a work bench and use vice grips to get it off. I was able to spray latex paint with no problem.It comes with 2 tips which is great. I don't think it will hold up if you do a lot of spraying but you can't beat the price."
5,Excellent product. Made in the U.S.A.,Excellent quality. USA made. Extra large gauges for those of us who don't see as good as we used to. Shut off valves at the end of all hoses is another great feature. I have used them many times now since purchase with no issues. They beat the heck out of the cheap imported stuff. I would definately recommend spending a few extra dollars for this set.
3,Pretty damn good,"When your looking for some quality porn, this item ranks pretty well. It was much more explict than i expected (chicks on chicks, female masturbation, almost completely public).Most of the girls were ""real"" and ddn't look like they just walked out of Playboy or Maxim. They could have been my next door neighbor and I like that. Most are late teens, early 20's and can surely make you hard.The major drawbacks are a segment with a very unattractive porn star named Sunshine Blue and a few minutes of less than hot older women showing off.Overall it is porbably worth buying."
3,"Good, but not what it seems","I bought this book because of Doreen Valiente's supposed authorship, and was unpleasantly surprised to find that she wrote the introduction only--not the book. That little deception aside, Evan Jones writes a very interesting account of a little-known tradition of witchcraft, but it sounds suspiciously like the 18th Century Occult Revival, and not the ancient tradition he implies. The book is certainly an interesting version of English Craft practice, and a good account of the late occultist Robert Cochrane, but you may not care for the bait-and-switch technique of crediting Doreen Valiente as the author."
2,Book for Idly Curious,"It does not content any original chants, prayers, divination, and powerful names like we use here in the Philippines...We have been in the actual practice of the Craft since tha Spanish colonization...."
5,Deeply moving history,"Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is represented by a number of quotations, some great photos and a thoughtful narrative that wraps it all into a compelling story. In particular the final section on the days leading up to the theologian's execution is deeply moving. It is a crime this book is out of print."
5,NASCAR lover,This is a great shirt for the NASCAR lover in your life. I like embroidered shirts and this one is well done.
3,Good board but slightly warped,I bought 20x30 Elmers Foamboards for various project. The price and the quality of the boards were good but I did have some trouble with them as they were slightly warped.
3,A benign view of The Rebellion,"Troubles (New York Review Books Classics)Major Archer survives the trenches of WWI, longing to return to his love, Angela, only to descend into a decaying social milieu in an Irish village. The actions and activities of the characters are more comical than serious exertions in trying and dangerous times. The dramatic scenes border on the chimerical and are entertaining, but deprive the story of tension and driving beats. Representation of conflict in the religious divide of the time is an intrusion at the edges, having its major impact on the Major's attraction to Catholic Sarah. Many of the passages drone on with little relief; better editing could have helped. The story line does provide insight into the Troubles, if light on the sufferings of Sinn Fein supporters.D K Elliott; Author, The Canyon Caper"
2,Smug and boring..,"This novel trudges through the inane life of a run-down hotel in humdrum rural Ireland, celebrating its setting of quaint backwardness. From the start its meandering drone fails to pull you in, there is no hook. The showcase of dry wit and sarcasm becomes boring. The tone is one of smugness. The basis of this novel, ridiculing a stereotypical Englishman as inept and out of place, and a stereotypical Irish character as dashing and witty gets old.. Farrell's characters lack inner depth, their words and actions read like a stage-play.Perhaps I should have stoically continued indefinitely, but to me a novel should grab you by page 50 at least..but in this case I got to page 105, and still there was nothing to draw me in."
3,"Troubles, by JG Farrell","I found this a difficult book to get into, I'll try again at some point but I'm not finding it engaging."
3,Troubles has some troubles but definitely not a reject,"I loved the topic and the way the ""troubles"" were interwoven within the Major's interactions. However, the story was too slow, very old fashioned writing. Definitely not a page turner."
5,Great character.,"I enjoy this book because of the great, strong characters that Mr. Farrell builds in his fascinating story. I love the dry British and Irish humor. I did not want to put this book down. the story is so compelling and a vivid portrayal of the period. There is plenty of humor in this book, but the climactic ""Troubles"" brought about by 800 years of British rule and horrific treatment of the Irish is told beautifully from a British view point that takes the Major, and the British, time to grasp the ""why."" There were many uprisings in the 800 years of British rule. This is the period of the fall of the British Empire. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a great story, or knows anything of the ""Troubles."" I would also recommend this book to any person who wishes to see how an Empire breaks to pieces.Allen Schweiger"
1,Rubbish.,"I bought this book expecting to get a few tips and ideas for building an eco-friendly house. Yes, the ultimate product is a 'green' building, but it turns out the author spent almost half a million pounds building this massive, wasteful house in the centre of London. Throughout the book he cuts corners and is constantly apologising for using not-so-green methods, for example a massive concrete foundation.Buy this if you have a lot of money to waste and you don't care how much you damage the environment during the building process.Don't buy it if you wish to learn about eco-building."
2,BEWARE! Rushed to market!,"This game certainly has potential but there are just too many bugs for it to be consistently fun. After playing it for just a day it has frozen up multiple times. I got another copy of the game and it also froze up.The Legacy mode also has some irritating bugs. For instance, the computer will automatically sign four 69 PGs to your team every offseason after the second season. This means that if you have a 5 Star PF wanting to sign with you, there may not be room because of the 69 PGs.Another annoyance is that ESPN forces you to control player movement with the analog stick. I switched off of the NBA Live series because of this same issue. Why ESPN NBA lets you choose if you want to use the analog and College Hoops does not, is a mystery.It is obvious that the game was rushed to market before Christmas and it really suffers for it. A potentially great game that has some serious flaws."
1,worst game ever made,"This, by far, is the worst game I have ever played. The camera angles are so bad that you can't even tell what is going on, and the players look like they are made out of rubber. Also, when a player dunks the ball, his hands don't come within 3 feet of the rim, which makes the dunk contest mode a complete waste of time. Anyone who thinks that this game is good should have their I.Q. tested. I, as as a long time videogame player, have one thing to say: DON'T BUY THIS GAME!"
4,this game is awesome,"i love this game. i always play this game.you can do a dunk contest and you can play horse tooi never played ncaa basketball before. if you never played ncaabasketball before,get espn college hoops.i love ncaa finalfour2004.when we brought it,i played it.i think it better thanncaa finalfour.you can play 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3 game.the highest is6 vs 6 game.you needto win in 21 points and you need to win by 1 or 2 points.if you goy NBA street,it will be just like that."
1,Avoid this game,"This game is quite possibly the worst game I have ever purchased. I had been searching for it since its release and finally was excited to have a copy of my own.That joy quickly turned into anger and disappointment within 30 hours. The game froze on me three times in those first 30 hours. This game is not worth even $10.If you want a basketball game, you should grab ESPN NBA Basketball... although I won't be buying any Sega Sports game for a long time after being had like this."
5,Home Improvement-3rd season,"Purchased this for my son, who is a Home Improvement fanatic. He loves it. Got it quickly and in good shape."
4,Another great season,"This review is for Home Improvement: The Complete Third Season DVD set. Like the previous 2 seasons, this season is great and full of great, clean, clever comedy. There are 25 episodes on 3 discs in this set, they are all excellent. The only downside to this set (and the reason for only 4 stars) is that there are no added features in addition to the episodes. Seasons One and Two included various comedy clips from the season, but this set only includes an ""Interactive Game"" in Tim's workshop. I'm not really sure what the point was in creating it...I don't see any value with it. You use your DVD remote to click on various tools, and clips pop up for a few seconds; not really worth the time. Overall, this DVD set is still great, and is definitely worth picking up."
5,Home Improvement 3 continues the laughs,My son (age 14) loves this show. And it is every bit as entertaining now as it was when originally broadcast on TV.
3,boring,"After buying the first two seasons, that was enough for me. First, for a comedy with really no extras, this is too pricey(I paid 35 for each season). The show itself is the same all the time. I like the scenes with the boys the best, they are funny. But Wilson and Tool Time are BORING. I had planned to get this set but found better shows to buy with alot of extras and lower prices!"
2,Very unsatisfied with this movie.,I really didn't care for it that much. I thought that Bo Stevenson stunk as the sheriff. The movie wasn't like the original one that was shown on T.V. years before. That one was GREAT! This one STUNK!
2,Plodding police and steroetypical characters run amok.,"This is my first Jo Bannister and I am very disappointed. These characters are steroetypically drawn and strain credulity. The plot borders on witless, and the setting (with which I am familiar) lacks resonance. My disappointment is tempered by the fact that I borrowed this from the library, saving my money to purchase new titles from credible successors to P.D. James et al."
4,Not Your Usual Backwoods Degenerates Movie!!,"What makes this movie so terrifying is that all of the characters are so believable. Four young campers wander into the hold up of a religious cult of ""southern boys"" and their mentor in backwoods Arkansas. They are not welcome and have to fight to escape from the nightmare into which they have wandered.I have never seen cold-blooded hate and brutality so well portrayed on screen. The viewer can empathize with the uncontrollable desire for revenge by each camper as they get even for atrocities.There is no explainable reason why people act this way but they clearly do and through this movie you may find yourself feeling the same way."
5,Resurrection County,"This movie was flat out awesome! Don't think this is just another kids go into the woods and get tortured movie, they add various different things to keep it interesting, unique, and gory as possible. If you want a fun to watch horror movie filled with gore and suspense, here's a good movie for you."
2,Not Starbuck's,"I really hate to hammer this syrup, but my wife just won't drink it. She is very fond of the Starbuck's gingerbread when it's in season. When she wasn't able to purcahse that, I ordered this. Me ... I don't drink lattes', however our company has had no problems with it. So, if you are hung up on Starbuck's, you may be dissappointed."
4,Busca a Jesus,"As a Senior Pastor to a inner City bilinguel church I have had the opportunity to see many in the Christian Music industry come and go. What makes Puchi so unique is his desire to not only have the best in music but also to be effective in touching the lives of those who are tire of being tired. Puchi Colon has achieve, in such little time what many desire to achieve but havent. I believe it is due to his sensitivity to His Lord and savior Jesus Christ.Puchi music is uplifting and annointed with a combination of excellency."
1,old version,This is the older version make sure you get the newer version.The new version is more current much better. This can be confused with the newer version so don't buy it.
4,Good bang for your buck,"I bought 2 pairs of these for my 2004 Mazda 6 (non-bose model) and they fit perfectly on all door enclosures. The high notes were outstanding (a perfect change for crappy factory speakers) and the low's were good as well (I'd suggest to get a sub-woofer if you really want PUMP). All 4 speakers were attached to a Profile AP740 amp (excellent amp by the way) and they handled perfectly. The seperate crossover was also a nice touch, but you will need a place to hide it, that is if you prefer clean/factory look installation.I'd really suggest these speakers to anyone wanting an upgrade for factory ones."

4,"good value, serves the purpose","It holds 224 CDs and it serves the purpose. It's not the highest quality product in the world, so don't expect too much! Overall, it not bad for the price!"
2,Light Duty,"Product is light duty, over time it will not hold up to being flipped and opened often, If longevity is your goal purchase elsewhere"
1,PVC material can eventually acid damage disks,"I did some research and found this out.PVC is BAD for cd's and dvd's. Degrades into acid and eats the discs over time, or in heat.Best deal to watch for deal on Targus 320cd case. The Targus, like Case Logic cases, use polypropelene sleeves - which don't decay and eat your discs. Polyethelyne sleeves are also good.The Velocity case however is EXCELLENT in all other aspects - I like the wide sleeves and the zipper allows for extra flexibility and not a tight annoying fit.Velocity if you hear this just stop using PVC and your case would be a 5 star!"
4,Rebate Form Needed,"Does anyone have the rebate form for this item? It doesn't seem to be available anymore.Otherwise, great value! Good, sturdy case."
3,"Lots of CD space, but too much zipper!!!","Its the first thing I noticed about the case, and it's enough to warrant sending back for another try at something else.I guess I should have been able to see the problem in the picture on the website. Thanks, but no thanks!"
4,Recommend to heal nails,Nails look much better after using this product. The only problem is that it emits a strong scent (might be dangerous around small animals and children).
1,Not as good as hyped,This stuff peels right off. For all the hype I expected more. I applied 2 coats and still it was peeling off the next day. A far superior product is OPI Nail Envy.
5,Unbelievable Results,Absolutely the best nail growth product I've ever used - and I've used many! My nails were a mess after having Gel nails so I gave Rejuvacote a try. My nails are now stronger than they've ever been. I have a full review of the product at http://over40health-wellness.com/blog/nail-care/gel-nails-a-cautionary-tale.
4,Buy it!,Good product! For growth of nails...however it does not help nails that are split.Hardens and grows nails. Buy it!
1,DO NOT BUY,"I thought this product would be amazing. Until i applied it onto my nails and it BURNS, i dont know why but it does. It feels like my fingernails are on fire! Do not waste money on this product."
1,TOXIC,"Toxic ingredients. All around DANGEROUS.Ingredients: Ethly acetate, n-butyl acetate, nitrocellulose, toulenesulfonamide, formaldehyde, resin dibutyl, phthalate, isopropyl alcohol, camphor, calcium pantothenate, gelatin, hydrolized keratin protein."
3,Better than I thought...,"I must say I was surprised. I only watched this movie because Mariah is in it, and really she was much better than the critics made her out to be. The whole movie is really kind of so-so, and there's not much in the way of plot or character development(so I had to give it only 3 stars), but it could have been much much worse. Mariah looks beautiful and it was a treat to watch her sing. I personally really liked the soundtrack so if you view this movie as one big video you won't be disappointed. The critics SHOULD have spent more time ripping apart her co-star Max Beesly. That accent was awful! If the public can forgive Adam Sandler for ""Little Nicky"" then they certainly should forgive Mariah for any missteps in her first starring role! ALL DIE-HARD MARIAH FANS SHOULD BUY IT."
1,There's no 'sparkle' in this 'glitter',"This move is as awful as everyone said it would be. I'm surprised that Amazon isn't selling it for $0.01. The movie is supposed to take place in 1983, but I didn't get that sense at all. Unless you want to see Da Brat in a dress, skip this at all costs."
3,Not Much To Say,"This movie is a train wreck; one bad plot after another makes for a less than enjoyable experience, but more a painful one indeed. However, this is not the worst thing I have ever seen, movies like ""Battlefield Earth"" hold that honor, and Carey really isn't that bad, although I can't say the same for the rest of the cast. I do not recommend that anyone go out of their way to see this movie, but I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss Carey as a potentially, as least, ""OK"" actress."
1,The TRUE crime...,"is that so many classic silent and early films are lost forever, but this piece of garbage will still be around 100 years from now. If a few words: as far as the plot goes, look up ""cliche"" or ""trite"" in the dictionary; it'll be there; it's just the old kid-from-bad-background-makes-good yet again, for about the 400th time. As far as the acting goes, WHAT acting? It's Mariah trying to upstage everyone else while sleepwalking through her lines. Save your time and money. And I have to say something about the reviewer who offered s short list of singers who have become ""successful"" actors -- Cher and a few others I'll grant ya. But Aaliyah and Diana Ross? PLEASE. Be realistic. Aaliyah couldn't act, period, and Diana's still chewing pieces of the scenery from Lady Sings the Blues (which, incientally was a horrible insult to the memory of Billie Holiday)."
5,A pure hearted story,Glitter....The big box office failure...Why was it so slammed by critics? People always have to tear apart anything anyone does just to have something negative to do. I don't think Mariah Carey did this movie expecting to win any big awards for it. It is simply a pure hearted story about a young talented singer trying to find her place in the world. This DVD was worth buying the day it was released especially for a fan like me. Watch it on a HDTV with surround sound and remember why we all fell in love with this talented singer in 1990. Give the movie a chance and decide for yourself.
3,Not as bad as I thought!,"Well I thought I would see this movie because I have heard it was really horrible, but once I finished watching it I honestly didn't think it was all that bad. I would have to say that Mariah Carey is a better actress than Britney Spears will ever be (which really isn't saying much though)."
3,IT' Wasn't ALL THAT or ALL THAT BAD,"The movie Glitter was not more than what you may have hyped it up in your head to be. If you thought it to be good before you saw it that's what it may have been to you. And vice versa with bad thought of it. I thought it was a typical, singer trying to act movie. I think Mariah did OK. I liked the movie it had a nice little message to it. But as far as telling anyone to just buy it, or it is all that. THAT IS WHAT IT IS NOT. But if you are or ""were"" a Mariah fan It's a collectible. Maybe she won't make another movie..lol."
4,fan of mariah carey=),"i liked the movie, thought it was cute. If you like cute romance movies and are a fan of mariah carey then watch it, it wont hurt ya lol."
4,Didn't deserve the bash it got...,"I rented this to see if it was really as bad as everyone said; it's not. Mariah Carey credibly plays a likeable person. I expected an embarrassing bomb of a performance, but it really wasn't so bad...not bad at all. Good to see Terrence Howard before his ship came in with ""Hustle & Flow"", and the rest of the cast was fine. I had no problem with the script, maybe a bit too reminiscent of ""Funny Girl"" at the end, and elements of ""A Star is Born"" and even ""The Color Purple"" (finding her mom). Also GREAT to see Eric Benet, beautiful as ever. The DVD I rented was full-screen, but I still enjoyed it more than expected. Worth a look...when Mariah is singing, those film moments really shine. She's quite fine."
1,Sloppy Movie!,"I'm sorry to all the other Mariah Carey fans out there, but this movie was torture. It only sold tickets because of her name on the posters. The photograpy is confusing and hard-to-follow, the acting is basic. Yeah, we all know she has a great voice, but did they have to do it up like poor kid with drug-addicted mother, but she'll make it because of stupid luck. I laughed with all the predictable scenes they threw in! It wasn't all campy enough to make it funny though, which was sad because they took themslves seriously. Next time, Mariah, look for something with actual substance!"
2,thanks mariah,"now everyone who sings wants to be an actress and everyone who acts wants to be a singer. She what mess she innovated in the process of trying to act when she should have just stuck to singing? What a waste that glitter album and movie were! Britney Spears(whom I don't even like) could have pulled this movie off better, it's more for people of her kind"
3,from music to movies,"this was mariah carey's attempt at acting, there was so much hype before this movie about her doing 80's sounds but the music was a disappointment with the exception of the ballads and this movie failed to capture the 80's though the plot itself isn't so bad. It's just the way the film production was rushed and that being obvious that affected the outcome of this film. It isn't worthy of any awards, stick to music mariah!"
2,KIND OF REMINDS ME OF ANOTHER MOVIE FROM THE 90'S,"I WAS WATCHING THIS MOVIE THE OTHER DAY.AND THE ""VANILLA ICE""MOVIE [COOL AS ICE] CAME INTO MY HEAD.SO I WENT DIVEING INTO MY VHS COLLECTION AND WATCHEDMARIAH CAREY ""GLITTER"" & VANILLA ICE ""COOL AS ICE"" BACK TO BACKTHEY ARE BOTH EQUALLY BAD AS THEY ARE GOOD.AND SO ARE BOTH THE SOUNDTRACKS TO THE MOVIES.IF YOU WATCH THEM BACK TO BACK IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE MADE ON THE SAME DAY.EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE A DECADE APART IN AGE.BUT MARIAH CAREY CAME BACK FROM HER FLOP IN FULL FORCE.SHE DID LET HER DOWN~FALL GET THE BEST OF HER.AND NOW SHE IS ON TOP OF THE WORLD AGAIN!VANILLA ICE CAN'T LET THE NEGATIVE PAST GO.SO HE WENT AWAY FOR GOOD.MARIAH CAREY HAS A LONG,LONG,LONG CAREER AHEAD OF HER!AND YOU NEVER KNOW MAYBE SHE WILL DO ANOTHER MOVIE AND IT WILL BE A HIT.IF VANESSA WILLIAMS AND WHITNEY HOUSTON DID IT.I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY MARIAH CAREY CAN'T(NEW YORK,NEW YORK)"
2,the movie was {BAD}but then again{SO WHAT}!,"THIS MOVIE WAS BAD.WITH A OK SOUNDTRACK TO GO WITH IT.BUT DOES IT REALLY MATTER SHE HAS 13 #1 HIT'S! NO SO BAD HUH!IF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A MADE FOR TV MOVIE FOR MTV OR VH1. NOBODY WOULD HAVE EVEN CARED HOW BAD OR EVEN GOOD IT WAS.DON'T JUGE HER ON ONE FLOP.JUGE HER ON HER TOTAL COLLECTION OF WORK.[AND THE GOOD IS 100X BETTER THEN THE BAD][a fan of #1 hit's and mariah carey has plenty]{TONY~TONI~TON`E}:ROME,NEW YORK:HOME OF WOODSTOCK 1999P.S.:THERE IS NOT ONE ACTOR OR SINGER WHO HAS HAD AT LEAST ONE FLOP;AND THAT IS THE TRUTH! (KEEP YOUR HEAD UP;AND TRY AGAIN)"
3,"Yeah, so?","I tried to dislike this movie before because I didn't want to seem lame, but the truth is it's really not that bad. I have seen way worse than this, and Mariah is actually an okay actress!It's not a great movie, it's not even a memorable movie, but what did you expect? It amused me and although I wouldn't recommend that you buy it, rent it for fun. Peace."
1,"Horrid, but not the worst of 2001!","It's bad. The clothes will make you cry, the acting will make you shreek in pain, the songs will make you scratch at your ears, the plot... well, there isn't one. If you think a guy named ""Dice"" is cool, this is the movie for you. So cheesy. Not in a good way like Showgirls though. Much worse.Still better than Vanilla Sky though!"
3,A fun movie.,"I had my doubts about watching Glitter because I had heard all of the negative reviews the critics gave it. Despite those harsh reviews, it was a cute movie.Surprisingly, Mariah Carey is a good actress, but the script could have been better. It's about a woman named Bille Frank (Mariah Carey), whose mother had to leave her at an orphanage when she was a young girl. Flash forward about twenty years and Billie is struggling to make it to the top of the music world, when she meets Dice (Max Beesley), whom she begins dating. He makes all of her dreams come true. But for all of that happiness, there's a price to pay. The ending is sad and unexpected, but also triumphant.The DVD edition contains two music videos from Mariah (""Loverboy"" and ""Never Too Far"") and director's commentary.Overall, this is a decent movie that I recommend watching, but Mariah Carey should stick to what she does best: making music."
1,Don't make me puke,"I am one of the biggest movie freaks in the entire world, I have watched the same movie a billion times practically without getting bored of it. And I had never seen a movie i couldn't sit through without the risk of getting phsically ill- until that is, i saw the disaster that was- Glitter. The acting was so one-dimensional, it was almost painful. The actors weren't engaging and i honestly wouldn't have been surprised if they had been holding the scripts and reading them off to each other-it would have had the same effect. Mariah Carey is without a doubt one of the most talented singers out there today and i think her vocal range is mindblowing- but you don't have to be a ""redneck"" to see that this movie totally blows. I swear, if she ever makes a movie again, I'm going to move to another country, so I won't even be associated with a country that would actually make a SECOND piece of crap like this"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,Ok 3 reasons not to see this movie:(1) Mariah Carey can't act.(2) The story was written by a monkey with a crayon.(3) You will want to jump off a building half way through.I would give this movie 0 stars but that apparently isn't an option. They should of paid people to go see this movie it was so bad.
3,"Not the best, But it's not the worst either","This movie is not as bad as people said it was. The only thing wrong with this movie is the acting. In my opinion, mariah carey is not that good of an actress, and she acts like she does in interviews and tv appearances. I like the 80's thing and the songs were ok. I think the story line could have been alot better and alot more original. To sum it all up it was an ok movie. But Mariah can't act. period."
1,EXCELLENT!,Pick this one up along with GIGLI! Bennifer can't match up to Mariah's acting though.You won't be dissappointed with this Oscar-caliber masterpiece!
4,"Oh come on, it wasn't that bad!","Considering that I NEVER listen to critics and other people's opinions. I found the film really good. Mariah was really good and she pulled off some very emotional stuff. i thought at first it was going to be the same type singer movie. Singer gets noticed, she hits big, she goes through a low, and then comes back stronger than ever but there was a lot of twists! It was a very emotional movie!"
2,Average 2&half,this Film wasn't the Worst Film I've ever seen not by a Long shot.I look at this film from the fact it's a Musician Film.when Singers are in Film it's different than Actors&Actress's.if you do away with the Many Story lines then this film ain't that Bad at all.the Mark Walberg KnockOff that Played Mariah's Producer&Love Interest is Very 3rd&4th tier as a Actor&it shows.but I applaud Mariah for that in a way because She worked with a Unknown whereas many other Musicians surround themselves with Established Actors think Whitney Houston in films with Kevin Costner&Denzel Washington.Mariah take away much of the Chessy Music&heavy-handed Story-lines She did a Respectable Job.
1,All that glitters is gold... not!,"Glitter starring Mariah Carey is so awful that you can't help but laugh at this box office disaster. I watched this turkey on t.v. awhile back and the critics were right, Glitter is one of the worst films of all-time. Mariah has stated this movie is not autobiographical but it is! I feel sorry for people who actually enjoyed this film, it's one thing to like Mariah's music but she can't act! This won't be a cult classic anytime soon, yawn!"
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"If you're a fan of movies that feature screaming, megalomaniacal divas and their relationships to shirtless guys, you have so far been limited to Barbra Steisand's ""A Star is Born"". But now, like a nut-covered cheese log from heaven comes Mariah Carey's ""Glitter"" - the film that, more than even her decade long string of unlistenable pop songs, landed her in the loony bin where she spent several months writing lyrics on the padded walls of her recovery room using a thick crayon held between her toes. A film that, without the barest hint of shame or irony, features as a centerpiece the Robert Palmer song, ""I Didn't Mean to Turn You On."" A film that, against all laws of logic and common sense, gives a prominent role to the former Mr. Halle Berry (a.k.a, Eric Benet.)No one, not even Mike, is dumb enough to take this one without some serious help. And serious help he got in the person of former MST3K cast member Mary Jo Pehl. A true RiffTrax event!"
5,worst movie of the year don't care cause i loved it,i used to dislike mariah but that all changed after i watched glitter i found her pretty cool and sweet i heard she'll be having a new movie in theaters soon and will be filming another movie that means mariah can act.ps .some people here are childish i believe are haters too if you didn't like the movie just say so not like advertising it's been nominated for the razzie award for worst movies how mean and harsh can people be.
4,highly recomended...,"if for laughs only.this is one of most horrendous movie I have ever seen but that's what makes so great! carey's performance matches that of diana ross'in THE WIZARD OF OZ, and has the presence of Julia Sweeney in IT'S PAT.you'll find a lot to like about this movie when you don't take it for what it wants to be... good.take it as one big joke and ejoy the show.WATCH IT! WATCH IT! WATCH IT!"
1,Really bad cinema,"All of the rumors and terrible reviews that you have heard about ""Glitter"" are unfortunately true. The rise of young singer Billie Frank (closely resembling Carey's own life) is dull, lifeless and dreadfully boring. The only time the film garners any speed is when some fancy camera work shows dazzling displays of New York. As for Mariah Carey, I have seen worse actors, but her performance is, for the most part, vapid and colorless. And she should slap her hairdresser and makeup artists. She wears her hair in a ridiculous one-sided ponytail that looks hilarious and when she is made up, she looks like Kathi Lee Gifford. Equally bad is Max Beeseley as Carey's manager who tries to act hip and ethnic. Horrors! There are numerous scenes that are dumb beyond belief but the winner has to be when Carey and Beesely, seperated and obviously psychic, compose the same ballad for each other!"
3,"NOT SUCH A BAD FILM, AFTER ALL","When i aproached this film, i did it with the expectation that i was about to watch, a terrible film, but to my surprise it turned out like a pretty normal movie. mariah, altough not a great actress, delivered a descent performance. the plot however was pretty juvenile. it didn't try to go risque on certain areas and thus the plot failed to deliver any real drama or emotion."
1,A different kind of review,"Yes, I haven't seen this movie. But rather than give you a lot of hyperboles relating to sewage or garbage, or subjective and personal reasons why this movie is good (and why Mariah Carey isn't useless as an actress), I will list some things I would rather do than watch Glitter:3. I would rather sleep in a bunkbed under Oprah2. I would rather engage in a frolicking threesome with Roseanne and her ""cool"" husband1. I would rather play naked Twister with every one of the Golden Girls"
3,"Bad plot, bad acting; Mariah Carey brings infectious charm","Despite it's bad rap given by the critics audiencesit's low box-office potential, and most notably, it's release date (9/11/01), ""Glitter"" brings life and vivid color to an otherwise dull and contrived plot, helped by pop queen Mariah Carey.As it is, the story is based on a rags-to-riches story about an aspiring diva in the '80s (Carey), which is marred by obstacles and contrived subplots. There's enough bad acting and scripting to give this movie 1 star, but Carey plays out her character with confidence and simple, infectious charm.Fans of Mariah will be well-pleased and impartial, nondemanding people who rent this on VHS/DVD will be surprised on how simple the plot is, helped by Mariah's beauty and her maturing acting ability. Give ""Glitter"" a look, it's not as bad as the others say it is."
5,you'll either love glitter or hate it,i am one of those who loved it and if you hated it i respect that cause everybody has different taste and to the reviewer from newyork get lost cause i think it's stupid of you to think that one of the best selling artists has only 12 fans she has over millions of fans who love her and nobody can't take that away from her.
4,Cute Movie and Entertaining,"Max Beesley has got it going on. His and Mariah's Chemistry was electric. I smiled, laughed and Cried. The first time I saw it is was Okay, but times 2-10 I keep seeing something new each time. This has become one of my favorite movies. It all comes down to It was a Romance, Success story, filled with emotion. I recommend this film as sweet entertainment. You'll feel the emotion throughout the entire film. Give credit to the actors and don't blame them for a less than perfect script, they did the best with what they were given. Max Beesley is dynamic, through the whole movie his eyes alone tell the underlying story."
2,I Love Mariah but....,"I am a HUGE fan of Mariah's... but I think it was a bad idea for her to carry this movie on her own name. There should have been other big name actors/actress' to help her out. Whitney at least had Kevin Costner (The Bodyguard), Will Smith had Stockard Channing (Six Degrees of Seperation), Diana Ross had various big name actors (The Wiz) and so forth. I Agree with other reviewers stating the scenes were to short. As soon as you get into a scene it jumps to another scene that has nothing to do with the pervious scene. As far as Mariah's acting... I felt that her expressions did not fit the scene (over acting). In the scenes where she is crying, you can tell the were forced trears. Actors should become the character, so that things come out naturally. Mariah also smiled entirely to much, especially when scenes do not need such smiles."
3,This movie is a must for any DVD collection!,"Ok, first of all this movie is really bad, but just like those movies that are oh so bad but oh so good- this is the case. I actually paid to see this in the movie theatre for the entertainment, after watching the movie I can see why Mariah shut it down for awhile. With all that said, this movie rules! I love this movie because it is hilarious from Mariah's character (Billy) to her boyfriend/manager Ice, this guy should have won an Oscar....well not really but he is the best by far. If you are an avid movie watcher and can actually enjoy some of those bad movies out there then this movie is perfect for you. My parting comments are keep an eye out for her cat in the movie, its amazing that the ... cat never ages."
3,THIS MOVIE IS EXACTLY WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE!!!,"(...) This is a story of a hip-hop backup singer that becomes a popular lead performer. That's it. How much hidden meaning and culture were you expecting. Mariah Carey remains true to form with her... wardrobe that she has adopted in the past couple of years, and the soundtrack is the same type of music she has been singing as well. I would suggest watching this movie if you are looking for some light entertainment, not if you want to watch a movie that will change the course of your life with it's message. Ms. Carey's acting abilities are not any worse than any of the other singer's that take a shot at acting. If you are looking for drama and a powerful story line, I suggest you watch ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Philadelphia"", or ""Saving Private Ryan"". Mariah Carey doesn't star in any of them."
4,SHAME ON THE PEOPLE WHO JUDGE A BOOK WITHOUT READING IT!!,"I saw this movie over the weekend and it was better than many of the over-hyped films that I have seen in recent history. It did not deserve all of the bad press. Mariah actually can act, surprisingly as good (if not better) than Jennifer Lopez. Her singing is by far better. It just goes to show that sometimes the media is only judging her based on her skimpy clothing and personal issues. They have not been unbiased and it is again a case of kicking people when they are down.I am not a big Mariah Carey fan and do think that she has let some of the diva stuff go to her head, but I would even give a good review to an enemy if they did a good job with something.It was entertaining."
2,Ridiculous movie,"I personally love Mariah, but she makes fool of herself in this movie. Babe, stop acting and just stick to singing: that's what you're doing best!!"
4,Mariah Shines,"What is wrng with critics? I am confused because the critics panned this movie and I have already watched it three times! It is definetely a chic flick, but Mariah shines! Her movie debut proves that she has been through alot in her life because the scenes that require the diva to cry and show emotion are extremely realistic. There is a slap scene that is great- hummm, can you guess who she practicied that move on? Mariah does a great job in the movie and if you don't have the soundtrack you don't know what your are missing! If you love '80s music you wil love her soundtrack!"
1,This doesn't look too promising. . .,"Based soley on that trailer, I think Mariah could use a few more acting lessons. Clearly she's playing it safe by taking a role doing something she's already famous for. That's not exactly a real stretch. I don't think people will be interested in paying nine bucks to see a 90-minute music video with a predictable storyline on the side. Perhaps it might have a somewhat respectable showing since she has a big fan base. But If it tanks, I hope she doesn't get Madonna syndrome and defiantly makes one awful flick after another; or worse yet, make another film with Da'brat."
2,"Not great, not awful, not campy... just terribly mediocre","After sitting through the entire film (which felt longer than the stated running time), it's hard to understand what all the fuss is about - both good and bad. This is a mediocre film built on a hackneyed, hole-ridden plot, shallow characterizations, and editing that strives for and fails to achieve true stylishness.The acting is good enough to keep the viewer from being taken `outside' the film, and suggests that, given better writers and directors, Carey could have ended up in a film that garnered more positive response. Much of animosity towards this film seems to be a reflection of viewers' animosity towards Carey herself. Her unhinged personal life and the headlines it's generated have translated into a great deal of personal contempt for her and her work.Those expecting a movie that's so bad that it's campy good fun will have to look to masterworks like ""Showgirls."" This one's little more than a bore."
4,Gift,I bought this as a gift for someone because they loved the movie. I also bought the soundtrack for them as a gift.
2,one word people: Mariah Carey cant act,"I dont even know why I **cking watched this movie. Because I liked movies and my career insists on movies but this one was a bomb within a bomb man. its one of those stinky, smelly, no good for nothing pieces of **it that comes along every now and again. for stupid fans of cant act, but I can surely strut my sluttyness Carey, I spit on this glittery crap"
2,an ok movie,this movie was ok for Mariah Carey's film debut but other than that the movie was not the good it hasd some good parts in it but overall not one of my favorite movies
4,4 Glittering Stars,"Preparing for the worst, I watched Glitter expecting a horrible, horrible movie. Instead I watched an entertaining movie filled with love and compasion. I didn't expect this film to be so depressing, but it did make me shed a couple tears I have to admit. The music works very well in the movie, so now I have a better appreciation of the soundtrack. I also love the last scene when Mariah shows up in the middle of the country in a limosine, decked out in a glamourous gown, reuniting with her long lost mother and then having an emotional breakdown. The scene is very surreal and very touching. Glitter ends up being a fabulous movie with alot of heart and a great soundtrack."
3,Not That Bad!!!!!!!,"I realize I'm in the minority, but I thought ""Glitter"" was pretty cute. Mariah is a fine actress, and she looked beautiful throughout the whole movie. I do know that I'm biased because I am a big fan of ol' Ms. Carey's, but I still think I could of enjoyed it even if it wasn't starring my favorite singer."
3,was obviously rushed,"I love 80's music and I love mariah carey, so naturally I was looking forward to the release of this film. Loverboy was not that great, but then I heard the beautiful ballad Never Too Far and was interested in the movie and soundtrack after all, despite harsh critics. When I saw the movie, I thought it was nice but everything seemed fast paced like it was thrown together. And they could have worked on making the movie more believable when it came to creating an 80's environment, aside from the music."
4,Mariah proves she can act.,"Everyone who doubted Mariah should offer an apology. Yes, this film isn't an Academy award winner but, it is entertaining. Mariah's portrayal of Billie is well done. It doesn't seem at all that she is trying to act, as alot of singer/actors do. She is Billie Frank. She delivers her lines as if she is the character and that is what acting is. Excellent work Mariah!! That goes to show you that in todays society people love to shoot someone when they are on top and that is totally wrong!!"
4,"Mariah ""Carey's On""","After hearing all the negative feedback and flack Mariah Carey got for her feature film debut ""Glitter"", I decided to see for myself what all the fuss was about. I DID NOT SEE what everyone is talking about?! Never before have I been more proud of Mariah and all she does! She deserves so much more recognition not only for this whole project, but all the efforts she put into it. When reading the film credits, you see Mariah not only did a fine job of acting in it, she helped produce the movie, and came up with some of the concepts herself, while at the same time recorded the 12 track soundtrack which also fits the movie perfectly and gives a great flashback of those funky beats from the 80's. Everyone is entitled to their own opinon, but if you have not seen this movie just because of what everyone ""says"", you are the one missing out!! Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!!"
1,Bad movie?? You're soaking in it...,"When are certain pop singers going to learn that they can't act? Take a look at Madonna,Ja Rule,Prince,Whitney,Britney and now,Mariah.This movie would've worked better,if they had a real actress that could sing or maybe even mouth the words,but this is plain embarrassing! Mariah loves herself,this we know,judging from her videos and her appearances on certain tv shows,but she ought to learn that she's a better singer than an actress.Stick to what you're good at! If you're looking for a laugh,unintentional,that is,then,this is for you..If you're a big fan of Mariah's,then you'll get this anyway--probably.I hear she wants to make another movie,but my advice is this:DON'T! Does the title ""Swept Away"" mean anything to you???"
4,"Ok, so it's not Gone With The Wind........","I actually watched this movie with the intentions of having a good laugh. All the reviews said I would however, I must say I really enjoyed the movie. I am not a big fan of Mariah's but the girl can sing. She's not a great actress but she brought a sweetness to the character she played. Hey, I don't think Julia Roberts is a great actress either and if she can be on the big screen, why can't Mariah? For some reason Mariah got a bad rap from the press, it really wasn't a bad movie. Rent it on a rainy night, break out the popcorn and enjoy!"
5,MsTheme Review,"I really really enjoyed this movie. It had a great plot and good story line from start to end. The acting was great. I wouldn't think twice to buying this movie or soundtrack, I have both."
4,Non-biased View,"I am not a fan of Mariah Carey. I think she is a great singer who under uses her voice alot with terrible songs and even more terrible music videos. I loved this movie though. Go into this ""Pop Film"" with no expectations and enjoy the fun ride. It made me laugh, yell at the screen and cry. Mariah Carey may not make music I agree with or music videos that I would vote for on TRL, but the fact remains that she is a great talent."
1,Cheesefest 2001,"I was hoping that Mariah Carey would prove everyone wrong and make a film that actually does something for her acting career. But judging from the cheesefest that was this trailer, she's gonna stink up cinemas everywhere big-time! I mean am I really supposed to believe Mariah Carey as a poor backpacking singer! She would have been better off in a movie like The Bodyguard, somewhere she could play herself. A character film like this is far too taxing for someone who's had so little acting experience."
1,Predator on Blue Ray not recommended,"While the movie is great I do not recommend the Blue Ray version. I have the movie Predator on DVD and thought the Blue Ray version would be a great improvement and also have extras. I was disappointed on both points. The vidio quality has no discernable improvement over the DVD and there are no extras (deleted scenes, actor commentaries etc.). I would not recommend this Blue Ray. After watching it once I gave it away."
3,Great Movie/Questionable Quality,"This is a great movie, certainly the best of Schwarzenegger's career. They did a good job with the audio on the new release with the 5.1 DTS, however the video transfer could use a lot of help. It comes and goes, there are some sections of the movie that look OK, and others that just look bad. I guess this will give them another future release to sell that will be digitally remastered."
4,Good solid Sci-fi thirller,"One of Arnold's better movies. The Predator is defenitly one of the better movie monsters of all time. There is a lot of corny dialogue in the begining which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars. The DVD has a good amount of extras and the picture and sound quaility is good. A little known fact though, the original predator was actually played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. You can tell the difference between the preadtor in the begining of the movie and the end. The director wanted there between a considerable difference between the predator and Arnold."
5,Best Scene in An action film,"The scene where dutch, apollo and jesse the body were simply firing their guns into the forest in hope of hitting the invisible creature was a real adrenaline pump. When i saw the film with my eight friends (law school conservative chaps) we were all peeled to the screen. Must have film"
1,Doesn't work,Item is in a format my blu-ray player does not recognize. I didn't spend enough money on it to warrant returning it so I will just eat it. Do NOT buy this product.
1,Defective disk.,"What can one say .I Time to go through the the hassle of returning it, and hope he next one works or is it just easier to get another disk. Like a used one at least I'd feel better about it being operational."
5,inuyasha!!!godzilla!!!!Dragon ball Z!!!bond!!!fan. AND JESUS IS OUR SAVIOR,ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I HAVE SEEN ANULDS BEST SINCE TERMINATER GREAT STORY AND ACTING EVEN BETTER THAN THE 2ND PREDETOR AND THE ALIEN TRILIGY!! ALOT OF BAD LANGUAGE THOUGH I HATE THAT
3,Not exact but okay,Ths item was posted as 'Widescreen' version but was not. Arrived quick and in listed good condition but thought I was getting what was shown as something it wasn't.~CC
4,Hunter becomes the hunted,"What if we were suddenly the deer in the field? Being stalked by an undetectable force with unimaginable weapons. The predator kills by skull size much like humans kill by weight or antlers. It hunts for pleasure. Planet to planet. A action packed film that reverses the hunting expierince. With Arnold in the movie what can you expect. His acting is great, and the make-up effects on the Predator are seamless. A great movie. A must buy, i reccomend anyone pick it up for there collection."
2,Predator,"High marks for the movie which I really like, but the quality of this DVD was poor! The DTS sound was awesome but the print used on this DVD was of very poor quality with nicks, scratches and hairs, dirt marks...it looked like it had not been cleaned. This I would expect from a Good Time video but not from Fox. The DVD opened with a spiel on how wonderful Fox videos are with fancy menus, extra features, etc. All this DVD offered was a still photo menu and a trailer. Very disappointing for a Fox video. I hope they'll re-release it with a good quality print and again with DTS."
1,Very Poor Transfer from Fox!,"I do not know what Fox Home Entertainment is doing here, but I recently replaced my previous DVD version of this film, hoping the DTS would enhance my viewing experience. The transfer has major grain on it, and the brightness and resolution is nowhere near the quality of the original DVD. Stick with the Dolby Digital copy. -bad move Fox."
3,Stanky transfer that is still several years old,"The items on this special edition were released in foreign markets TWO YEARS AGO. That would not be bad except the transfer is also the same and not a very good one at that. Grainy is the order of the day. In high density color scenes shot from the Predator's point of view, it's really tough to discern shapes. The base transfer Fox has used for this release (same as the previous DVD) is just middling. It's not awful. But if you are buying this in hopes of a restored cleaned-up version of your favorite action film, minus all the dirt and grain, you're going to have to wait. This seems to be how Fox double-dips their customers, as with the non-anomorphic transfers on the ""Planet of the Apes"" set."
1,So much DNR it's unwatchable,"Simply put they applied so much noise reduction to this movie that it looks awful. There is none of the original film grain, and no detail at all! The only reason to buy this movie is if you want the best example of how incredibly bad an HD transfer can be. If you actually like the movie (like I do) run away, watching this movie will make you cry seeing how a perfectly good movie was destroyed with a horrible transfer. yes, in this case only, the DVD actually looks better then the Blu-Ray."
1,Buy the 2-Disc DVD instead.,"I picked this Blu-Ray up for $10 thinking I was getting a good deal. Turns out the old addage, ""you get what you pay for"" rears it's head again in this case. Predator on Blu-Ray actually looks WORSE than the 2-Disc DVD upscaled through my BD player. Oh, and they also cut most of the special features for the Blu-Ray. So just to recap, 2-Disc DVD looks better, has more special features, and costs the same (or less). Don't be a sucker like me and stick to the DVD for now."
5,~ A must see... ~,"This was probabaly the greatest movie ever created, think about it... a nearly invisible alien that hunts people vs. the guy from terminator!But this movies not just about death and killing people, its a story about death and killing people that u cant get tired of, a great cast supports the plot, Jesse Ventura and Carl Weathers also star in this awesome movie, and its kinda cool to see a governer pull out a mini gun and start killing guerillas!Even though you know that he will probabally survive in the end, it doesnt hinder the plot... cuz its got an awesome ending! i recomend this for anyone whos never seen it..."
1,listed under wrong title,This title was listed under the dvd section. Bev ery careful to see if your getting what you ask for under that specific listing.
1,Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED,This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover.this is first version of the movie. Get the special 2 disc set.The same this for all the 6-5-07 fox releases. The Dummies at fox did not even notice that on predator is DTS but the new fancy cover say D.D.
1,Shame...,"Although I live in Sweden I usually buy reg 1 DVD's. The reason to that is because of all the extra stuff that are included... But not in this case.I you are a true fan of Predator I really recommend the UK reg 2 version of this movie! Check it out yourself to see what I mean.Oh, this is a really great movie btw."
2,Poor Film Quality & Extras,I enjoy the movie however this package is not worth buying. While the extras are awful I could live with them if something had been done to clean up the film itself.Sometimes the film gets grainy and the colours wash out and neither has been fixed for this release.Until they do some restoration I can't think that there is a reason to buy it. The original single disk package should suffice.
3,Nice and Bloody,"This movie is nice and bloody,Just how I like my steak!.Arnie is recruited on a mission in Central America to recover some troops and is stalked by a chameleonic alien.What I like about this is that it starts like ""Rambo:First Blood Part II"" and ends like ""Aliens"".But I was left with one question.If the Predator is so tall(about 7 feet) how can it cling to tree trunks sideways and upside down?"
5,A perfect action movie,"It's very difficult for the large number of people involved in a film to make one that's perfect, but Predator is one such example. Outstanding story, action, setttings, and characters. It opens a whole new class of story. It's not man-vs-himself, man-vs-man, but man-vs-alien.A US Special Forces team is tasked with a mission deep in an unnamed tropical country. Little do they know that their breed - professional warriors - is the desired prey for a trophy-hunting alien who remorselessly uses the finest galactic sporting technology to hunt down the hapless humans. Alone and armed only with their courage, the humans are forced to confront the ultimate killing machine.This movie is 15 years old and is still my favorite action film. A must-see for action fans!"
1,Avoid this seller that goes by 2 different names!,"Received the DVD & all looked ok! When played the best part of the whole movie is when they all fire their guns into the jungle at the same time but this DVD freezes just as that is about to start & resumes after that scene. I reported this to Amazon.com but my concerns/complaint has fallen on deaf ears. AVOID NorAm International Partners, Inc. who is also Overstock_Deals!!!!!"
4,Amazing digital transfer -- WTF are others complaining about?,"I bought this expecting another incredibly disappointing transfer since the DVD was absolutely horrible. The DVD looked as though the film had been practically been recorded off a VHS tape. This Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu-ray, however, has a crystal clear image. For the life of me, I do not understand the people who are complaining that it is too clear. If you're happy with grainy, prehistoric images -- watch the VHS or the original DVD release. If you bought a Blu-ray player because you appreciate High Definition and clarity, this Blu-ray is for you. I've been incredibly disappointed with some other Blu-ray releases of older movies, but this release of Predator is a reminder that it IS possible to do an older film justice."
4,wish I could figure this out,"I rented Predator from Netflix on Blu Ray, and now i wish to buy it. It is the most beautifully rendered Blu Ray I have ever seen, and I have state-of-the-art playback equipment. I cannot figure out which disc this is on Amazon to purchase. Netflix sends the cover art as ""collector's edition"", which does not exist in Blu Ray. The reviews of Blu Ray Predator discs seem not to be the disc i just saw. This would be the all time demo disc, if I knew what it was."
2,Not Worth the Money ...,"Just echoing the comments made by several other reviewers, there's absolutely no reason at all to by the Blu-Ray version of Predator. That assesment stands regardless of if you currently own the movie or not.With virtualy no extra features at all and picture quality that doesn't look one iota better then the standard definition release (clearly the film wasn't remastered), the two disc standard definition version continues to be the edition to buy.The movie is one of my favorites, but this edition represents a terrible dollar value."
4,Best Arnold film?,"The first Predator movie may just be my favorite Governator movie, but then there were a lot so it's tough to remember them all. The story was only slightly corny, the action was great, the cast had good chemistry, and this movie was the beginning of a decent series, then later combined with Alien to make a second series. If there was any way to make this movie better it would be to get the collector's edition."
3,ok arnie movie,"This movie is okay, I don't why everybody say this is Arnie's best movie. The whole time Arnie and the monster are battling in the jungle is pretty tiresome. I would say the best part is Arnie's troop and the enemy's troop fighting, not the main monster battling part."
3,Bit disappointed :-(,"Excuse my broken English ;-)--I was wondering to see this ultimate movie.So i spent my money for DVD which should be best in picture and sound.So i put in and enjoying Arnie and his group in action.And now why i was dissapointed.First quality of picture(but i excused it-old movie),sound is not bad.Whole movie is shorted :-( grr.Example :scene in village,Arnie stick man to the pale-missing.Waiting around the trap.Mac is shaving(missing).Action scenes shorted. Guerillas not fall from nests, flying in the air and not burning. There are no red analizers(predators voice)on the sides(which where in red color-VHS).I thought that DVD version will be longer than on VHS.I expected some more specials.If i would know that i would buy VHS.I'm giving 3, :-(.If I am wrong let me know...."
5,A True Classic!,"I saw this movie on the big screen and have loved it ever since. Back in the era when the action movie was king, there were a lot of really good ones and a ton of bad ones. Over the years, it became harder and harder to surprise audiences. But Predator did just that. It starts off as a straighforward action film. Arnie and his crack team sent on a rescue mission. And the first half of the movie is just a great action movie. Then the science-fiction angle is thrown in and the movie becomes something more. I just love this movie! And this set has a lot of great features, interviews and making of stuff to really give a complete overview of a classic film."
4,Predator is the coolest space monster around!,"This movie is absolutely superb! I liked Alien, but this one is even better! The fight scenes were awesome, and Arnold did a great job. Also, Predator himself was stellar and everything an big, evil space monster should be. I thought his weapons were outstanding and that his final fight with Arnold was the best part of the movie. And the ways he killed his victims were as juicy as roast lamb! His costume was cool, too. I especially liked the quotes ""Bleed? I ain't got time to bleed!"" and ""You're one ugly motherf***er!"" You like space monsters or science fiction? You should see this."
3,I ain't got time to bleed!,"Jesse Ventura says it all. Even after being shot, he is so caught up in the action that he barely even notices. Watching this movie has a similar effect: most of the time, you'll be so involved in the suspense/action/horror/whatever that you won't even realize how mediocre this movie is. That's a good thing. This movie stands out in other ways, too: the Predator is extremely well-done, with more and more slowly being revealed over the course of the movie. The characters are MUCH more distinct than those in other horror/action movies without falling into any stereotypes, and there is a genuine feeling of comraderie between them. The way the actors do everything feels very authentic, and gives the impression that they really are experienced military troops. The whole ""shallow plot but extremely well-done"" routine is very similar to that of the first Alien movie, so it's no wonder that Dark Horse combined the two.Overall, a very cool ride, despite the paper-thin plot."
4,Predator DTS version,"At the time of buying, Predator was only available in Britain in a hopeless edited version, missing all kinds of scenes and snippets. I thought i would invest in the region 1 version to get the full cut. I was not disapointed, with the film. The sound however, still does not sound quite right. Jungle hisses in the background sometimes come and go mid scene as different characters speak, and some of the explosions are not quite perfect. Then again, this is one of my favourite movies, so i'm going to be picky.It has little in the way of extras: one trailer, and no moving menu's etc.If you just want a good quality version of the film with no fuss, then this is a good value version.Now though, a special edition uncut two disc version has just been released in the UK, with all kinds of extras and bits on it in a flashy box. ""sigh"" I wish Fox would get it right first time and stop costing me so much cash. ....Third time lucky!"
4,vietnam redux,"This can be seen as an allegory of the American experience in Vietnam. Well-intentioned Americans off to do a rescue mission are betrayed by the mission's designers, who change the mission on them and wind up feeding them into a meatgrinder, along with everybody else. The end shows a broken and bewildered Arnold, who at best just survives. The music is what puts the movie over the top; it's simply perfect for the film."
5,A GOOD MOVIE,A group of military commandos are sent on a mission in Central America and are being hunted by a savage vicious creature from anther world who to kill them all. few survive inthe action packed thriller where only the fitest survive against the savage predator that haunts them down. Good action and speacial eefects and wait till you see the creature for your self!!
5,Outstanding special effects !!,"Arnold's performance..outstanding !! The Special effects used for the ""creature"" are amazing !!! A must see and each time it's viewed you will discover more exciting details !!!"
1,DVD was blank,DVD was blank and I waited to long to return it and now I am stuck with a blank DVD. so watch it as soon as you get it.
3,Eh...,I love the movie but I didn't see any improvement in resolution over DVD I was disappointed in that aspect to say the least.
5,What can I say it's a classic,"When I need to relax after a hard day at work or after a busy weekend schedule, I just reload Preator. The bad guy gets his, the good guy wins and the earth is saved! what more needs to be said....After all it's Arnold!"
3,Misleading Description,"That's basically it, i mean i like WIDESCREEN movies but this is NOT widescreen... still a great flick though. The film quality like people are saying is dated but i still love it, that's part of the reason why i like to watch older movies. To see how they looked before i was born.UPDATEI wrote this right as i started the film, but as the film progresses i realize how BAD the audio is. Its either too hard to hear or too loud. Three stars now."
1,Like others my copy does not play,Like others have reviewed my copy of Predator does not play... in fact it seems to be a completely blank disc... how does something seemingly this widespread slip through quality control. I am now currently Predatorless.
4,Gonna have me some fun!Gonna have me some fun!,"Underrated Schwarzenegger Classic! Starts out as a shoot-em up flick, but then turns into a psychological game of cat and mouse between Ahhnold and the Alien predator. Good Action."
3,"""Stick around"" (if you can tolerate the script)","I remember 'Predator' from many years ago when I was younger and remember enjoying it. Watching it again recently on DVD made me re-examine it. For a start, there's no plot at all, at least with Alien for example there were some decent twists. Secondly, the almost 100% male cast hardly say anything let alone have any decent characterisation. Thirdly, it's quite boring! The Arnie / Predator fight sequence at the end tends to go on for about a third of the film!The DVD isn't very hot either - no special features at all and the picture quality is reasonable to poor (probably from a bad print). Sound quality is okay, some of the surround effects are good but nothing stands out.In summary, it's okay - it's a must-have if you're an Arnie fan but looking back on 'Predator' it's not much of a classic!"
3,Great plot idea...bad execution,"There is no doubt about it: the idea behind this movie is thought-provoking, interesting, and original. The story itself is very interesting to think about...and it is scary.The only problem I had with this movie was how they ruined such a great idea. There was simply no suspense in the movie whatsoever, and the movie just got stupid at some points. It wasn't scary at all to watch, although (as I mentioned earlier) just the idea of an invisible savage alien creature brutally killing your buddies is frightening.The second half of the movie was just plain bad- especially the ending. It didn't really carry that well, and it was just all very silly.In conclusion, this movie pretty much ruins an ingenius idea. This is definitely not one of John McTiernan's best works. His directing in Die Hard and The Hunt for Red October was much better. The bottom line: rent this movie but don't spend ten to twenty dollars buying it."
1,Worst Quality Ever!,"I have to say, this is one of the worst transfers I have seen. Do not waste your money. Watch the DVD."
1,Did not work in my PS3,Purchased this movie for a very low price (under $4.00). I have always liked this movie but the one star is for it will not playback on my PS3. Figured it wasn't worth the time or effort to send it back because of the low price. Guess you get what you pay for.
1,Doesn't play on my ps3,"I have tried and tried and tried, but this blu-ray will just not play on my ps3. I have never had his happen with a disc before, but no matter what I do the system will not recognize it. Very disappointed."
1,Worst looking bluray ever,"I'm not sure what the deal with this bluray is, I played it side by side in a non had tv of the same size with the dvd.THE DVD LOOKS BETTER THAN THE BLURAY.IT's so grainy and muddled and awful.Side note that's kind of funny, in the credits it looks like they are holding them up with plastic wrap or something and filming the floating letters."
3,Run through the jungle action,Look there goes Arnold running through the jungle shooting large guns and keeping his dialogue to a minimum. His friends are doing the same thing only they are getting killed. If you like movies that have high popcorn value then you should buy this Bluray disc. It is the best transfer so far of this movie available in any video format. If you have seen the DVD versions of this movie you will know what I'm talking about. They are all washed out and super murky. There are still some problems with this transfer of course- it is anything but perfect but it still looks pretty good for an action film from the 80's. If you want this movie for special effects or to show off your great bluray system this isn't the disc for you. However if you just want to watch a decent scifi movie filled with blood and frantic alien chase scenes then break out the popcorn- send the kids to bed and prepare to watch some mindless action and 80's style jungle warfare violence.
5,Hahhh! Hahhh! Hahhh! Hahhh! Hahhh! Hahhh!,"This the best Preditor film! It's even better than Preditor 2! Arnold is excellent! The Preditor Alien is BETTER than the Alien from the movie Alien! Awsome graphics,for an 80's movie!,cool bloody gore!,and it's a little scarey! The ending is so cool! It has cool weapons from a M-16 Machine Gun with an Grenade Launcher!,to a powerful Chain Gun!,and to a deadly Laser Cannon! A MUST get film!"
1,Awesome Movie - Terrible BluRay,"Being a die hard Predator (not Predator II of course) fan, I considered myself lucky to find the Blu Ray version on sale at target for $15.00, and I bought it to replace my SD version. It is OMG terrible, could even be worse quality than the SD disc. If you're considering upgrading to Blu Ray - DON'T!!!"
2,Don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray version,I have both the SD and Blu-Ray version and can tell no difference. This is the second FOX transfer I've bought and will buy no more till they clean up their discs. These appear to be nothing more than the SD version pasted on a Blu-Ray disc.
5,Schwarzenegger's Best Film!,"This is an amazing film. The tension is completely covincing, in fact, this is one of the rare films that had my heart pumping big time. It seems that after seeing enough creature-action thriller films, you become desensatized to the thrill, that's why this film shocked me so much. Everything from the heavy action, to that onimous drumbeat that means, ""predator is near"" screamed complete surrender.If you are a Schwarzenegger fan, or just like really good movies, see this.PSDon't see this if you're the least bit squeemish, as some of the violence tops Saving Private Ryan."
1,Shameful Quality Blu-Ray,"This is the worst quality Blu-Ray I have come across so far. $26.95 is outrageous for a DVD to Blu-Ray dub. Your probably better off getting the widescreen DVD than the Blu-Ray and playing the movie on upscaling DVD player, you will get the same quality. The movie is classic, just don't buy the Blu-Ray version unless you find it in a bargin bin somewhere."
4,Very Well made and Origonal,"i tohught this movie had a pretty good story, good suspence and great action. one of my fav parts is where they completely annihalate the forest. the predator himself was keeped pretty well hidden through out the movie and that sort of created a Jaws feel o the film. over all a well made/planned movie......"
3,I don't think this was one of Arnold's more influential ones,"Predator is a horror/action movie that was most likely inspired by Alien.This one has all of the elements of an Arnold adventure (the big guns, unforgettable quotes, etc.) but tends to lack the good story and spellbinding suspense and action. At first there was a good Commando-like plot that started it all as 'rescue the hostages and say hasta lavesta baby to the baddies'. The creators did well with bringing the story into play; they didn't just say 'alien come and beat up ahnold'. It started to lose the charm with its lack of dialogue and adventure. Instead, it was just mindless shooting and running through the jungle. Yeah, that's what makes it realistic but they overdid the realism. This still deserves three stars, though, but just isn't Arnold Schwarzenegger material."
5,A must have for any collection,"How do I give this movie more than 5 stars? Excellent movie, great cast, and a fantastic alien. Basically this is a strong, vs the stronger, who will win? This movie never fails to entertain. Own it."
5,"A Great Movie, But A No-Frills DVD","Predator was one of the first movies re-released on DVD, and as such, it lacks a lot of the ""extras"" that most of the more recent DVDs offer. All you get here is the full-length full-screen movie, which is enough, I guess, but I would've loved to listen to some audio commentary from Arnold or director John McTiernan or even a few words from the Predator himself :) Some ""making of"" stuff would've also been a nice addition. Plus, there's also some historical significance here that can't be ignored: I mean, you have not one, but TWO future governors in the cast! Wouldn't it have been great to have Governor Schwarzengger and Governor Ventura talking candidly about what they went through to make this movie and what they've been through since? Well, maybe someday Fox will release a DELUXE multi-disk DVD of Predator and it will include all of the above and even more. (How about a ""Where Are They Now?"" feature that'll tell us what in the world happened to Sonny Landham.)"
2,Try Special Edition Instead,"Having read so many complaints about this particular DVD edition, I'd recommend the Region 2 Special Edition (available from Amazon.co.uk) if you can play Region 2 PAL DVDs.The Special Edition features the same transfer as this disk (with DTS) but comes with a second disk loaded with extras (all of which are great). As well as that, the menus and packaging are also far superior. It doesn't look like this will be making it to Region 1 for some time (after all the previous releases), so this looks like your best bet for the foreseeable future."
1,Stick with The Special Edition DVD,"The Whole HD-DVD. VS Blue Ray HD Format War was so unnecessary for the ConsumerThe Fact is There was No WinnerEach one of us were ""Screwed"" in different waysbetween the Over-the top pricing on the 1st Run of BR & HD DiscsThe Hardware ect.This BR was Proof at the time The Studio didn't Care about Quality (Both Predator and The Terminator on BR 'Could easily Destroy The HD Format 'Cause they don't Show off How Stunning The HD Format Can be)Avoid this BR you could put it side bye side with the Out of Print Laserdisc and u might not be sure which is which!To add Insult to injury the BR is Naked Not one worthy ExtraJust hold on to the Second Print Special Edition on DVDpoor excuse for a Hi-Def Transfer20th Century Fox should re-call all these BR and Replace them with HQ BR TransfersI wouldn't take it if it was Given away for free"
5,This is the real king of the jungle!,"Even though I slightly prefer the sequel, the original is still creepy and entertaining. Here we are introduced to the ""Predator,"" an alien hunter who has crash-landed in the jungles of Central America. Little is known about this strange species; only that it'll kick your @** if you get in his way. Add in Arnold Schwarzenegger and his team of soldiers and you've got a bitter conflict between human and alien. I got to say that this is one of the few movies in which Arnold gives a very good performance. You get to see him in some well-done action sequences. The supporting cast is good as well: who would have thought that Jesse Ventura could act? The action is solid; the blood and gore aren't very excessive, but they're still tons to see. And of course, the ""Predator"" is the real star in this film; that, and the special effects (which still looks realistic today)."
4,Arnold is something else,"Made when Arnold still had a great deal of muscle to spare. This movie, like a lot of science fiction, assumes aliens will be a hostile group. Those races that make it to space would have the intelligence and capacity to engage new races more amicably than depicted. How else would such a race even reach the level of achieving the ability to travel in space unless they had learned to live in peace. Otherwise they would not have lasted long enough to do so."
2,Buy the previous blu ray disc!,"Predator is one of my favorite science fiction films, so I was eagerly anticipating the release of this film with digital remastering. However, my anticipaqtion is now total disappointment. The film is so over digitally restored that it does'nt that it look at all like the original film. Most scene's look unnatural and fake! Yes, I know movie's are fake, but if the special effects are done to make the experience realistic, as they were with this film, it now makes this version of the movie look extermely unrealistic. Save your money and wait for them to re-issue this disc the way it should have been or, if you already OWN THE PREVIOUS VERSION, STICK WITH IT."
1,"Great movie, great extras, TERRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY","I am not going to write a long review about the movie itself. We all know Predator is an awesome movie and most people looking to buy it will be looking at this... But AVOID the new ultimate Hunter Edition on Blu-Ray. Some idiot at fox thought it would be a good idea to use DNR to remove the film grain from the image. The result is a flat & soft image. The original Blu-Ray looks natural and detailed with film grain and all. I think when DNR is used, there should be a warning on the package. Most Blu-Ray players have a DNR feature, let the consumer decide if they want to remove the grain and not force the film purists to put up with DNR."
1,Stay Away,If you want your films to look like film do not buy this movie. It has had liberal amounts DNR (digital noise reduction) applied which gives the film a fake waxy artificial look to it.
1,DEFECTIVE!,"If I could rate this disc a negative 5 I would. It won't play in ANY blu ray player. It won't play in either of my PS3s, and it won't play in a brand new Sony blu ray player. I have so many DVDs and Blu ray discs, and this is the first one that I have ever bought that doesn't play. You can't tell me that Amazon doesn't know about this defect, which is why they are selling this disc for such a low price. Shame on you Amazon!"
1,Terrible DVD Of An Excellent Film,"Predator is a very good movie and is very unfairly underrated but this DVD bites big time. The picture and sound is bad (the picture is grainy and the sound constantly skips). Not only that, but there are NO extras other than the trailer (which is a Teaser if you can believe that!). The cover has also changed and is pretty lame. Just buy the video and stay FAR away from this craptacular DVD. Fox should be ashamed."
4,This is no Child Predator!,"Absolutely the best Arnold film made... great cast of characters with a great action story and non stop mayhem.. oh on a side note... "" if all you had to do was cover yourself in mud and drop your weapon..maybe thats what you should do!"""
4,Nothing like this has ever been on earth before...,"That was the tagline I believe for this very smart, very fun movie. At the time that was a very true statement. I still remember the first time I saw this film. I was chilled to the bone unlike I had ever been before (granted I was only 13). The film follows a group of US Army Commandos led by non other than the manly man himself Arnold Schwarzenegger (of whom I am NOT a fan but he works here) as they are picked off one by one by a mysterious creature. This creature has come down to hunt men and that he does. The action is top notch, and the final showdown between man and beast is brilliant. Even now, almost 20 years after the film's release, it's still top-notch entertainment. From the moment we see the skinned bodies hanging from the trees to the moment we hear that horrid creature laughing as he knows his life is over we are glued to our seats and ingrossed in one of the best action films ever to be released. And to think, this stars Arnold?!?!?!"
1,LIars,"It says 'Widescreen Collector's Edition) yet when I ordered it from a user it was fullscreen. Do NOT tell people it's widescreen when it's fullscreen! I was angry when I received this in the mail. The reason it gets it's star is because of how awesome Predator really is, I just wish I could watch it to it's full potential."
3,Good Movie bad sound,I have always loved this movie; however the audio on this DVD is less than satisfactory. The sound is not in Dolby Digital which reduces greatly the enjoyement factor. AMAZON.COM you need to sell better quality DVD'S.
5,smash hit of Predator footage,all together this is a dynamic dvd set {must have} the documentry of how the film was made back in 87 w/ behind the scenes commentary makes it all the more worth wild!!! especially the lay out on the Predator costume as well the interviews w/ john mctiernan are also good in Mexicojust would have been great if a few yrs back when the scond one was done if they had arnold of course back in the Jungle setting!!!!
5,Predator (Blue-ray).,"Oh man, what an American classic. This is my favorite movie of all time !!!I am so happy they decided to redo this masterpiece. Blue ray makes it even better. Awesome LOVE it !!!!!!."
4,About time the Ultimate edition came out on blu-ray,"If you had the Ultimate edition on DVD, you're not missing much. The only reason why I picked it up was that I got it at Best Buy for 14.99. I can live with that..."
1,Farshtunken...,The disc does not track on several players I've tried. I believe it is the product of poor quality manufacturing.I will be extremely hesitant to purchase a DVD from AMAZON in the future with this experience.
2,Disappointing Blu-ray quality,I have always loved this movie and looked forward to seeing in Blu-ray quality. Both my husband and I were bummed. Some scenes were somewhat clear but the overall results were not worth paying for a so-called Blu-ray quality.
3,how to review an new review on a old title,"I own a copy of PREDATOR on DVD , an was scaning the reviews before I bought this new Bluray version . Most of the reviews are 5 years old an are for the last BLURAY verison , not the 2012 . I wish Amazon would make a better catagoy for theses new copies that come out , rather than cross -copying them from previous reviews . So when looking to buy the lastest version of a movie , please visit the "" NEWEST REVIEW "" , and make your deceison from that . Predator is one of the best Schwarzenegger movie ever made , an also the best in the series . Most movies made in the last century didnt have the same digital quality , the newer movies have now days an the tranfer is quite different an is costly to do so . Perhaps that is why they havent gotten the BLURAY We all want to own . Its up to FOX to make that decision , but your money if you wanna spend it on something you will reget . You make the choice ."
4,Blu-Ray Transfer Is Fine,"I have been upgrading some of my DVDs to Blu-Ray, and Predator was a movie that I wanted to see in hi-def. But the reviews mentioning a bad transfer scared me away. Well, I have now seen the ""Ultimate Hunter Edition,"" and the transfer was very good. Apart from a scene early in the movie, where Carl Weathers appears to have waxy skin, the rest of the movie is crisp, and the colors are vibrant. I am thinking that the negative reviews refer to a different transfer of the movie. The Hunter Edition is fine. Unless you are extremely fussy about video quality, you will be pleased."
1,Grain filtered garbage,"There are two Blu Rays of the film. The old and this new one. The old is grainy like the film itself. Unfortunately the compression is only MPEG2 and can't handle the grain properly. It looks like film with some compression artifacts on top. This new Blu Ray is the same transfer, just with large doses of digital grain filtering applied and then well compressed. It does not look like film anymore, it looks like a video game. A wax museum with CGI puppets and scenery. If that's your thing you will love it. I'll stick with the old BD and wait for FOX to come to their senses and give the unfiltered transfer an appropriate AVC encoding. Or better, redo the transfer so it's state of the art. Filtering older transfers to death so the anti grain crowd is appeased is just lame."
4,GREAT ARNOLD CLASSIC!,"An authentic goodArnold film: violence, but with brains. It introduced a character (THE PREDATOR) who even went into comic, with success. Last important appearance, in movies, by the great ""APOLLO CREED"" from ROcky..."
5,Predator Rules!,"Predator was a truly magnificent movie. Arnold's best role yet! He has no Romance,just really cool action.Action lovers must see this movie.I think the Predator should have won, judging by the facts.This movie has stunning special effects, a good cast of characters,rather interesting storyline.I give it 10 out of 10.So if you haven't seen the movie yet, get goin' to your video store now and get it!"
5,great entertainment,"The best action of schwarzenegger. Picture and sound quality is so good. This is a ""must have"" item for schwarzenegger and sci-fi fantasy fans. Although it looks like a war movie, it's a horror show. Watch it."
5,Spine Tingling Excitement,"This is simply a superb sci-fiction movie. Directed at a cracking pace by John Mctiernan the film begins with a first rate screenplay. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the larger than life hero and absolutely in control. The character portrayed by him is a cool,icy commando respected by his team though mercenarylike. What holds absolute audience attention is the natural outdoor settings, no-nonsense special effects and the tense action. Dutch & his group of loyal army buddies are out on a rescue mission in South America and out of the blue an evil alien who loves skinning its victims strikes terror in the dense jungles. Even the battle hardened team of tough guys are baffled at this almost invisible alien who simply kills & disappears. A truly memorable film though not for the slightly squeamish. A must see Arnold special."
3,short version,"This DVD version seems substantially shorter than the letterboxed cable channel version that has recently been shown. Perhaps the owners are trying to milk the market with an inferior DVD, then hit us with an expanded version later. In any case, I think we're being cheated here. Caveat emptor."
2,"good movie, lousy transfer","I'm reviewing the blu ray more than the movie; pretty much everyone knows what it's like. But this transfer...oh my god. It has more grain than a wheat field. The picture's fuzzy, and on my 50"" tv it barely looked any better than the DVD version of the movie. There's also NO real special features, just a theatrical trailer, so there's really no point in buying the blu ray. Maybe someday they'll clean it up more, but this transfer sucks."
1,save your money,"This book is okay for someone who does not own any other kind of cook book, otherwise this book is useless. I bought this book assuming it would have some authentic CAJUN recipes, but was disappointed because it had watered-down versions of the originals. THIS WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY."
5,Jensen Bluetooth USB Stereo Audio & Data Transmitter,"February 03, 2009This product is excellent. it enabled us to have music everywhere in our home, wirelessly.This means a lot for seniors like us who do not need to move around just to control the main source of our audio device.Thank you.More power to your enterprise.Edna Droegemeyer"
3,hmmm,"if you're really into the simpsons, i'd get it. otherwise, it's just like any normal game of chess except more expensive."
3,"Okay, but lacking in feature description","This is an okay set of rose lights. However, I was a bit disappointed in the fact that the edges of the roses are covered/caked in heavy glitter, which is not listed anywhere in the description of this item. The item's image on Amazon doesn't even reveal the glitter covering the roses' edges, but makes the roses appear to be just simple, colored plastic, which is was what I wanted and what I was expecting from this set. What I received is much tackier then what I expected to receive, but it serves its purpose."
3,It's good,"I originally bought this thinking it was the soundtrack. My choir will perform this song. They really like it. Repeat...read carefully, it's a listening CD. The entire compilation is a country western type musical to help kids learn about God."
3,Lackluster,"I bought his ""Clouds"" CD back in 2004 and I still enjoy it very much today. After putting it off for several years, I finally bought the Tarot CD recently. I was disappointed with it. The music is OK, but lackluster compared to Clouds. Many segments of many of the songs on Tarot are very similar to those in songs on the Clouds album, but they are imply not as enjoyable for me. Something is missing, it just doens't capture my mood and imagination like the music on the Clouds CD."
5,Listening to the last track while reading will blow your mind!!,"First the good news- this is an exellent new age disc(inspired by the Tarot) to open your mind while reading the cards or even just picking a card and meditating on it. The better news- the last track on this disc, ""the Wheel of Fortune"" is the best track to syncronize reading a spread with. It features a ""climax"" type ending that, if listened to while reading an ""outcome"" card, will really blow you away! Thats how I felt and would recommended it to other Tarot readers. 5 stars!"
2,Not fully developed,"I guess everyone has to start somewhere. This novel used much of the same material as, but is much weaker than, Richler's later excellent novel Solomon Gursky Was Here. St Urbain's Horseman is too long, the characters are too weak, and the story too muddled to justify it's 450 pages. The Montreal sections are much, much stronger than the parts set in London, which I suppose helps explain why Richler moved back to his native city."
3,For fans of gentlemen thieves,"Although Romney Pringle isn't as interesting and memorable as E.W. Hornung's character, Raffles, I still enjoyed the clever plots of each chapter. Pringle's personality is held a bit in the dark, but the surprising story conclusions make up for it."
4,Worth It,Definitely an interesting CD for your New Age library. Some tracks get a little cheesy at times but overall very good and occasionally transcendental.
1,Ridiculous!,"I wanted a book that would give me multiple ideas for beautiful table settings. So I ordered this book called ""Table Settings - 100 inspirational stylings, themes and layouts"". I thought I was getting a book with 100 different sample table settings, when in fact it may have 100 pictures, but very few table settings. It has pictures of a bowl or a plate. There are pictures of cookies, flowers, name cards, forks and knives, a tassel, and even a photo of some wrapped asparagas. It borders on the ridiculous to call itself a Table Settings book. There was no way to preview various pages in this book, so I relied on the title to purchase it.I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this book. I have never returned a book before, however, I want to send this one back."
2,Table Settings,It was not in as good condition as I thought it would be which is a chance when you buy used but mostly I was disappointed in the content. Did not live up to it's claims.
4,caught the varment!,"it took about 4 days to try different ways,the cats we were trying to catch were shifty,1st we caught a big something as we found the cage across the yard upside down, so we staked the cage to the ground,then they dug holes under the cage & got the food, then we tiewrapped cardboard on the sides so they couldn't fish the food out & we finally caught all the wild cats to take to the shelter. We also caught opossums. Be careful & let them sit for at least half a day to move the cage as they are very angry . Good luck, it's nice without the pests, well, now the racoons are here. Here we go again, I might need bigger cages. I suggest you measure out the size so you can see exactly how big (or small) this is.The smallest one is very small. I got 2 sizes,& caught in both."
4,Good to catch squirrels,"Did the job. Seems sensitive , so the animals outfox me somehow. Set about 4 times before a squirrel is caught."
4,Havahart 1040 works well,"Based on reviews, I purchased this product over the smaller 5""x5"" version to catch squirrels and glad I did. I can see where the smaller version may not work well with long tail animals. I had no problem with the latch mechanism out of the box (as reported in other reviews). It took the the squirrels awhile to become brave enough to venture in, but within a couple weeks I'm down 4 squirrels and 1 rat. FYI, I use a half ear of corn as bait with an elastic band to secure it to the plate."
1,"SHODDY materials and workmanship, and broken when received","Rife with manufacturing defects. Trigger rods and bait pan do not mesh. Bait pan is not level when the trap is set which tells you something is seriously off. More importantly if you do manage to set the trap, it WILL NOT TRIGGER without heavy weight on the bait pan, which no small animal can deliver. Can't lower one of the door locks when set, because the roof is warped that side. TRASH. What a disappointment, I had heard so many great things about this trap."
3,Good but not great.,This is an okay resistance training. The instructor does good at prompting you. There were some lower body workouts that were challenging but I did not feel anything the next day from the upper body workouts. Good if you are looking for a beginnings resistance training workout.
4,"Looks slow, but a tough workout","The first impression of this workout was not a good one. The set and instructor were a bit generic, and I did not have high hopes for the intesity level. However, once you get into this workout, it is very good. There are several moves that my body is not used to, which is good. This is not the most challenging DVD, but a must have for beginners, and more specifically for those who need a very low impact workout."
4,I felt it,"This was the first time I worked out with an excercise band (I usually use hand weights) and I was surprised to find that I was sore the next day. Very happy to find that it works either different muscles or the same muscles in a more effective way. Whichever it is, I will continue to go back and forth between this and my other DVDS to keep from getting bored. The only thing I didn't like was that I felt like the upper body moves when the strap is held under the foot were fairly jerky instead of a smooth motion. Maybe as I get stronger and the band stretches out a bit..."
4,Rare funk on a budget,"The funk on this cd is good stuff.If you like funk spend a couple of dollars (literally),turn it to '11' on your volume control and throw down this tasty outing from one of the kings of the funk, mr sly stone."
4,I would never buy from Mass Closeouts Again,I received my product but I also received a bill on my credit card that they illegaly signed me up for some discount thing with a charge of $10.00 for a monthly account I activated when I purchased a product from them.Joel McLaughlin
2,Not so fast...Lambo!,Bought this for my son for Christmas and we are a little disappointed. The performance is quite tortise-like as well as the battery doesn't last more than 5-7 mins. The detail is pretty nice so if you want it for a conversation/display piece it would do the trick.
3,Good read but short,"As the parent of two toddlers I found lots of great insights and advice for the future in this book. However, I found the chapters too brief (not enough depth on each topic) and a lot of the suggested activities were repetitive."
5,Best of the best,"Sage is easily the most talented MC on the planet. With Personal Journals he continues to amaze. Spot on lyrics at every turn; even with his worst stuff he's still better than the rest.Best lyrics: Message SentBest production: The Strange Famous Mullet RemoverOther standouts: Personal Journalist, Inherited Scars, Black Sweatshirt, Runaways... but it's all good.Hopefully up next is the long awaited Non-Prophets LP where he'll collaborate with Joe Beats, one of the best underground producers I know."
5,good,"yeah uh sage francis is amazing. no matter what people say, his talent for rhyming/poetics is excellent. yes people will continue to call him wack and whatnot but that is expected. i saw him live earlier this year and it is amazing. his game is rapping about problems in his life and other things. but people say atmosphere does the same thing. sorry but atmosphere is emo and tell them to eat it sage rules"
2,Lost Sage verse found in Bible Code,"Absurd long-words perform surgical intrusions,Impeding the brain with cranial confusions,Convoluted metaphors create pompous delusions,Leaving cyberpseuds with paranoid illusions"
1,Good Poetry not Really Hip hop,"Sage Francis sounds like a confuse Alternative rocker.He lacks anessentail ingredient of Hip Hop ""Street savvy"".The beats are Kind of Stale. Nowhere near the Rakim or even Jay-Z. (Hate him If youwant he's the best!) Just Because you Rap about your little sister doesn't make you dope. The Guys at hiphopinfinity.comare Crazy for saying this guy is the MC of the year, PLEASE!!"
1,Personal Issues,This has to be the worst album I've heared in a long time! It sounds like it was produced on a two dollar budget!
5,Are you ready?,"I pruchased this album a few months ago and haven't been able to stop listening to it since. Some people may not be ready for some of the issues that Sage Francis is talking about but if you've ever heard anything by this artist before it is a must have for your collection. I wouldn't recomend it for the younger hip hop crowd (it may be to advanced). Each song is given a journal entry in the insert for an explanation of what the song ment to Sage, and you can add your own past experiences for a better view of the issues. An absolute musical pleasure and a must have for all underground heads!"
4,Replacement belt,"Store told me there were no belts available, company dropped the product. You had them online and cheaper than in the store years ago. New belt works great."
1,Vitamin Order - disappointed,"Amazon failed to send the correct item. What was sent was a 60 capsule Adrenal Plus instead of what we ordered, which was 120 capsules of Energy Plus. I will say that when we reported this error, Amazon provided us with a full refund. So this low score is just for Amazon mismanagement of the Vital Nutrients. Vital Nutrients in reading the first review, was most accommodating by emailing us with a lovely email that offered to complete our initial order at no cost. For Vital Nutrients we offer a score of A+++. Vital Nutrients vitamin products are excellent and we had been so disappointed to receive the wrong product. Vital Nutrients provided excellent customer service, even when Amazon failed to process our order correctly.Vital Nutrients Energy Plus 120 capsules"
4,arthouse cafe 3,"I found this selection of European Film Music harmonically well put together...although I expected to have the themes played a little longer - some are only two to three minutes long - This takes away from the beauty of the melody. Otherwise the combination between the themes in ""Il Postino"" and ""Cinema Paradiso"" or ""Zorba"" combined with ""Amarcord"" and ""Das Boot"" makes it a very atractive C.D., offering ""the unexpectated""."
1,Painful for Police Officers to Read,"This text was required reading on a recent promotional exam. I had to memorize the reasons police are ineffective at fighting crime, how the Broken Windows theory is wrong, and how COMSTAT and the NYPD had nothing to do with the drop in the murder rate in NYC. If you believe that the police can do nothing about crime and should concentrate on fighting poverty and improving social conditions, this is the book for you. If you would like to learn about how to build rapport between a community and it's police force, go somewhere else. It made me angry to read this book, knowing that it is being forced upon police supervisors who have to memorize this information in order to suspend common sense and test well. If you think Dirty Harry carried a .357 (even the pop culture references are wrong) this is the book to buy."
5,Great soap,"This soap is wonderful. I'm 32 and have been washing my face with this soap since I was 14. As a young adolescent, I had acne, my mother also had it so her dermatologist recommended basis...well I used it also assuming my mother and I both have sensitive skin and I never had to worry about acne again. Unfortunately, none of the stores around my area sell it!:("
5,A great soap for allergy-prone people,"Basis soap for sensitive skin is wonderful for people who react to harsh additives. While using other soaps, I found that any residue would give me eczema. I have used Basis Sensitive skin for many years now, and have never had a problem."
3,prevents acne & cleanses well but no effect on exiisting acne,It arrived on time very good soap it refreshes skin soothes well smell is good neither greasy nor over-drying the reason m giving it 3 stars & nt five cos i did get 1 pimple while during its use though not severe & its not effective on pre-existing acne or acne scars but still i will recommend it as it cleans well when u wash your face giving the feeling tht u r deeply cleaned
5,top - rate,i read this book a few years back and to this day i remember it vividly. i loved it! its portrayal of emotion was great.
4,Rose Without a Thorn,"This is an awesome book, I'd reccomend it to anyone who is interested in Tudor times or Kathryn Howard. We're all so lucky it came back into print! This book weaves a rich tapestry of romance, polotics in Tudor times, and other such subjects. Read it quickly."
3,Disapointing:(,"After reading 'The Thistle and The Rose' (which I thought was considerably well writen), I decided to read this book to help me get a better picture of that era. It was a TOTAL waste of money (considering it cost $13)!! I gave it only 3 stars for four reasons: first, it had several adult situations, second, it was quite boring (it took me a week to read it,because it was SO boring I kept putting it down), third, it lacked detail, and fourth, it lacked the style you often find in other books by Jean Plaidy- there was NOTHING interesting about it. Although disliked it rather strongly, I must admit that after reading it I know a little bit more about Katherine Howard than before."
5,More than you know,I have read much that has been written about King Henry's wives. This novel gave so much more personal in depth information. Seeing it all through Katherine's eyes was spellbinding.
3,I've read better...,"Well, I've read several books about Katherine Howard and this one was just ok. It didn't really bring anything new that you haven't seen or heard before over and over. It had all the basic information, which was quite well-researched, but it was overall, pretty boring. It protrayed her as just plain stupid, which is ok, but it was kind of hard to read her point of veiw since it was that way. I was quite moved at the end even knowing her fate already, so that was an accomplishment....Overall, it was by no means bad- it just wasn't the best."
5,Great Entertainment,"This was a great summer read. I enjoyed the intrigue, action, and daring of the characters. The potential of biological weapons was introduced as a palpable threat not to be taken lightly. The importance, therefore, of diplomatic relations becomes all the more crucial. The author did some good background work in presenting the complicated political situation of our island neighbor. Using that as a backdrop for a thrilling adventure kept me turning the pages. A surprise ending that sealed the deal. I would recommend it to all."
4,Good use of old biological threat scenario,Good little story about a sudden threat from Cuba. Enjoyed the narrative on life in Cuba and the people living there. Character development was a little light - especially if you are not familiar with Grafton/Tarkington from previous novels. Addition of the CIA agents was very good. As Grafton's rank increases it's becoming harder to keep him in the action. Some of the instances where the battle group command team inserts itself in the action are like those old Star Trek episodes where the least expendable people expose themselves to the most danger.
2,Not one his better books,"I felt the book was a bit slow. I like his books when he writes about aviation (Flight of the Intruder, the intruders, etc.) Here, the aviation seemed secondary to the action on the land.What I'd like to read is a prequal to his ""flight of the intruders"" book, maybe having him a nugget on his first combat cruise, or having a book about jake even before that, describing his naval air training, the replacement squadron he was in, etc."
4,Grafton,"I have enjoyed the books on Jake Grafton, the only thing that doesn't always ring right is when Grafton is on the front line or ""leading the way, that would just never happen, sorry but the best way to be in charge of an operation and in control of the battle would be to be in the control center where you can see and respond to enemy's reactions, not in the lead aircraft or on the ground. That part is just not very realistic."
2,Disappointed & Dull,"Seems like Coonts just went through the motions on this one. I dove into this book expecting another fast-paced Jake Grafton military thriller. Soon discovered Jake had a minor role and thought: OK, maybe Coonts is passing the torch from Jake to Toad Tarkington. Much to my chagrin, Toad also had minor role. Call this one a DUD."
2,another bomb,"In the usual fashion of Stephen Coonts novels they take the best clip from the book to lure unsuspecting people to buy the book. Once you get the book though you trudge through page after page of slow and boring literature.. To put it into perspective, I am more likely to pick up my Economics text and read it for fun than i am to read Cuba. The book is horribly drawn out.. What could have been said in 100 pages has been drawn out to 390 pages. Guess I should have learned from the Under Seige. I recommend reading a book by a better author such as Dale Brown or Tom Clancy."
3,An average Grafton novel,"A worthy addition to my Coonts collection. A must read for Coonts fans. However, nothing special."
3,Not up to Jake Grafton,"I've read most of Jake Grafton's book and it's still behind Jack Ryan's one. I think that ""Cuba"" is making it worst. Actually, I don't see Jake taking much part in this book.Story line was mixed, great at time, boring at others. Some (too much) incredible stories are going on inside this one."
2,Stilted but otherwise enjoyable,"Coonts gets the politics of present day Cuba all wrong (Castro, survivor of countless assassination attempts, allows an underling to accumulate enough power to threaten him and where is Raul?) He also misses the boat on some of the cultural aspects (Casinos in Havana while Castro still lives.) Nonetheless, if the reader can get past the unlikley setup, the story is interesting though not gripping. Still, like a film shot in Vancouver, B.C. while supposedly taking place in Seattle, this reader could not put the obvious errors regarding ""location"" out of my mind."
1,What ever happened to the storyline?,"I've been an avid reader of Mr. Coonts books up until now. I was really disapointed when I read that Fidel Castro was ""alive"" after being killed in the book ""Under Seige"". Even Jack Yocke wrote a series of stories on the subject on that book. I expected a lot from this book and I didn't get it."
1,"dull, unintresting, did not hold my attention.","did not in no way come up to the standard of any of his other books, all of his other books were outstanding, cuba read like it was written by someone else."
2,only OK,"I enjoyed the story, although I think Mr Coonts has been going down hill since the first 4 Jake Grafton novels.The story was contrived, and continuity was poor - little things like didn't we have some uprising in Cuba during ""Under seige"" (probably where we should have left Jake, Toad and the gang)In a real world situation should an Admiral not be back at the Carriers CIC during the fighting - where he can keep an eye on the whole battle?To sum up, fans of the Grafton series will enjoy the book, but you you do need to read thru a fair bit of the ""yeah right"" bits."
2,Short on ideas?,"OK, Ill keep this simple. The big dissapointment for me was the ""return"" of Castro after his death in Under Siege. Are we running short on plot twists here? If you know what Im taking about, i was half expecting El Hakim to swoop from the sky and attack from his transport plane. Its a good read, but not on par what I have come to expect for this author. He must have written this book just to get something out on the shelves to please his publisher. So, its interesting, but I would really like to see this author get back to ""basics"" and further develop the Jake Grafton gang of characters and not try and bring back the dead."
3,Not like his others but still a good read.,"It was a little slow in the beginning, but the end was lightning fast. I would have like to have read a little more about Jake but the ending made up for any shortcomings."
4,good but not the best,"A bit slow at times and required some perseverance to read, but at the end became a page turner and more in keeping with what I expected."
2,Not exactly a page turner,"I have greatly enjoyed Mr. Coonts past books, most of which I found gripping and hard to put down. But with Cuba, I found it hard to pick up. I don't think I can explain exactly what is wrong with this book other than saying it is..well...kinda dull for this author. The plot is rather plodding and never really fully encompasses the reader in its excitement and, personally, I don't really care about Cuban political struggles. I'll say it again, I really can't define what is wrong other than the fact that the book is truely boring. Don't waste your money on the hard-cover edition, save it for the paperback or, better yet, check it out from the library for free."
4,wrong addres,"bobby bare and martina mcbride cd are sent to tthe wrong address should be in nevada, but went to montana, now what?"
2,Not his best,"Bobby Bare is a great singer, one of the most underrated country singers ever. However, most of the songs on this cd pale in comparison to his earlier work like ""Detroit City"" and ""Millers Cave""."
4,Midori Carries Your Mind to Tranquility,"Having stumbled on Midori's BALI recording, I was captured by a mystical wave and taken to a place of total relaxation. The Bonsai Gardens continues the peaceful journey. Forget those meditation recordings with soothing sounds and explore a musical woodwind path that also features environmental backgrounds. But its the music that makes the journey special."
4,My favorite battery operated vibe,"The price here is a little higher than I've seen elsewhere. I love this vibrator. Next to the Wahl Coil for clitoral stimulation and the pocket rocket for fun on the go, this one is a favorite. I don't find it flimsy, but it does have too many settings. I love the constant vibe with full power, but there are four other pulses offered and it is tricky to get back to the preferred setting once the new one is engaged. My current iflex vibrator has served me well. The batteries must be inserted properly and the back shut tight for the vibes to continue, which may explain why the other authors have been frustrated and complained of short life. If my husband didn't provide some technical help in this area I might be as frustrated as the others. I would love to see an updated version with improved button controls and more secure battery compartment."
1,Bad product,I knew when i bought it that it was $20 under all the other sites and that should have thrown up warning signs but i still bought it because the other Doc product i bought (from a store not online) Has been working for 3 years if not more now. But i have had this product less then a month and already the moter is dying and i have to smack it to start moving again. Don't buy these they just plan suck if u want something that is going to last go somewhere else.
3,good book and bad service,"this is a wonderful textbook for learningbut the shipment of amazon is bad, until I pay it for higher price, or it will delay and delay"
4,Just a Great Pair of Shoes,"Nothing fancy about it. It's just a comfy pair. I definitely wouldn't pay more than 50 bucks, but it's still a great pair of shoes."
4,"So far, incredible good.",I'm halfway through the book and I can't put it down. Historical fiction at it's best. If you like this one read Byzantium by Stephen R. Lawhead. I'll give a final review when I finish this book.
3,Dhammapada,I thought this little book was sweet. It was small enough i could read it in one day. It helped show me the importance of serenity and meditation in my daily life. I liked the thought that Jesus the Christ might have even read this before. Because it was more than likely written before him.
2,Unhappy with this translation,"I cross referenced this translation with others and stopped using it. I settled on Ananda Maitreyas translationn from Parallax as being a much more satisfactory pocket version translation. The Byrom version may well suit some people, but I was very unhappy with the translation, although I do recognise that some lines were translated elegantly (hence 2 not 1 star).It would be wrong to judge Shambalas pocket classics by this one book (or specifically my personal unghappiness with it) as the series includes a real gem in Reginald Rays Pocket Tibetan Bhuddism Reader."

3,The rest of the story,"It's about time someone got this story right. These stories completely shatter the myths created by Castro's propaganda machine and his U.S. boot-licks over the years. Far from being Batistianos, the men of Brigada 2506 were overwhelmingly pro-democratic Cuban patriots, many of them former revolutionaries, who were exercising the only choice Castro had left them. What these men did was perhaps the purest and noblest act of self-sacrifice on behalf of human liberty in the Twentieth Century history of the Western Hemisphere. Thank God someone thought to put these stories down for the record before it was too late. In the future, when the people of Cuba are free to inquire into their history, they will be able to discover who the real Cuban patriots were."
2,Could have been more objective,"Unfortunately, this book breaks little new ground, and tends to glamorize the participants in the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Castro's Cuba."

4,"Very good, but not the best","I purchased a Syncmaster 171v around a month back. The installation went off smoothly using supplied CD s/w and the display is sharp and clear till now. Most application s/w and games look good in it. It's higher contrast ratio of 400:1 gives text & graphics a crisper look. It's anyway much better than my previous 17"" Samsung CRT.However, on the downside, the supplied Natural Color s/w is a bit confusing to adjust for best settings. Related to this is the fact that the colors don't quite look rich enough. Another prob. is that my external TV tuner sytem (PAL based) is not compatible with it (though it worked well with the earlier CRT). I don't know whether I am facing this problem alone.I would recommend this LCD monitor for anybody keen on a good, stable display and who doesn't want the very best, and therefore more expensive stuff :-)"
3,Not a bad buy - at the right price,"I bought a 171v at [a local store] for [$$$], with a...rebate. Installation and setup was mindlessly simple. I found the Natural Color SW to be useless. After a week I exchanged the unit for another 171v, as there was a noticable color/contrast gradient from top to bottom. The replacement unit had the same color/contrast gradient from top to bottom, although less pronounced. I am not sure I will keep the unit or get a refund and buy an LCD monitor with a digital input."
2,"Buy it for the photos, forget the text",This slim volume is an introduction to the work of this forgotten Los Angeles builder/draftsman. He produced some wonderfully whimsical houses for a brief period of time.To compare his work to that of Schindler or Neutra is criminal (as was Kesling.) It is a pleasure to see the Schulman photographs and the redrawn floorplans. The text is not informative- it could have been left out entirely leaving room for more pictures and floorplans. For someone with a love of Los Angeles or Streamline Moderne architecture this inexpensive volume is worth a look.That it is inexpensive makes it worth the look.

4,Excellent Season,"All of the episodes of ""The Golden Girls: The Complete Third Season"" were outstanding. Overall, this season was excellent. However, I was disappointed with the special features on the DVDs - I think they should have included more features, such as bloopers and outtakes. I thought that the ""Golden Moments"" and ""The Golden Girls' Scrapbook"" features were pointless; they were basically just a rehash of clips from ""The Golden Girls."" You can already see these clips from all of the episodes, so what exactly is the point of putting a bunch of clips together and calling it a ""special feature?""My ratings -Season 3 episodes: 4 out of 5 starsSpecial Features: 2 out of 5 stars"
4,God bless old ladies,"The Golden Girls are a consistently sure thing. Though I feel Season 3 isnt the best of them all, it is still Golden Girls, which is never a bad thing. The DVDs of this series are a little lacking on extras (more commentary would have been great), but altogether not bad."
5,Fantastic show!,I ordered this season of the Golden Girls for my teenage daughter who loves the show! She was super happy and watches it over and over during the weekends!
5,The Golden Girls - The Complete Third Season,"I enjoyed every minute of this DVD. The ladies in the cast are of my generation and I can relate to the situations that they experience. If you're down-in-the-dumps and want to shake off the blues, laugh yourself back to happiness with this Golden Girl DVD."
5,Season 3 is here :),"Just wanted to add out of all 7 season's this was the highest rated season of the show coming in as the 4th most watched show in 1983.for those who haven't seen season's 4-7, I cant remember which season but in one episode Stan strike's it rich w/a invention and starts showering Dorothy w/ gift's, at one point he show's w/ car keys, Dorothy refuses the car, saying she will not drive around w/ plates that say ""pot head"",(Stan replies he didn't have room for "" potato head "",Dorothy kicks him out, all of sudden Sophia run's toward the door and yells out the door"" HEY STAN CAN I BE POT HEAD! This show is sooo funny."
5,Great season 3,"WELL, THE GREAT NEWS THAT SEASON 3 OF THE GOLDEN GIRLS IS ON IT'S WAY(PITY SO MANY MONTHS AWAY!).. BUT ITS WORTH WAITING FOR THIS SUPERB PROGRAM TO BE RELEASED ON DVD... I HAVE ALREADY PLAYED SEASONS 1& 2 DVDS TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AND PRE ORDERED THIS DVD ....."
5,JACKSONS THOUGHTS,"SO FAR EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER PURCHASED AMAZON, HAS BEEN AS ADVERTISED.... PRICE, AND SHIPPING,HAVE BEEN ON TARGET, AND REACHED ME IN PRISTINE CONDITION, AND ON TIME....NUFF SAID"
3,Too political.,"I am a fan of the golden girls but this season was too involved in politics and wasn't very funny. I think Susan Harris was getting a little desperate, i dont know why, because the golden girls were a very successsful show."
5,Golden Girls Addict,"What can I say? I just love those women and can't get enough of them. I laugh so hard every time I watch them (and even cry sometimes), and I plan on getting every season."
5,"A great, easy-to-read guide!",I've been using the Wiley GAAP guide for the past four years and I couldn't practice without it. It presents the standards in a clear and easy to read format. I find the interpretations tell me exactly what I need to know in plain English. I always know I can depend on this book for information and keep in handy on my desk at all times.
4,Good reference,I bought it as a reference book during an MBA class in Financial Statement Analysis. Helpful and complete.
3,"Nice sink, but arrived damaged","My wife fell in love with the sink, but it arrived damaged so we had to return it. It is well over 100 lb and it must have been dropped too many times in transit, so the finish was scraped off in several places. I would have given it five stars otherwise. It comes with a few cool inserts (strainer, rack, etc.) and has a very unique design.Although the sink appears to be well made, the manufacturer should package the sink better so that it could withstand the rigors of transportation. It needs 2 people to lift the large box and UPS usually has just one person on the truck, so my guess is that its going to be dropped. Our box was torn badly and re-taped before it arrived. So somewhere along they way, someone knew it was damaged. It might be best to use a carrier that sends 2 people to unload."
4,Better than an expensive faucet,This was a great purchase. It was not expensive and it works really well. The pull down is nice because the on/off is right there on the head. It is especially good for getting that last debris that is usually hanging around in the sink. The soap dispenser is the weaker part. Perhaps it wasn't installed tight enough. It looks great though. They are a good looking pair.
4,Good for the price,"Looks good, works well. The sprayer seems to be a bit light quality but for the price it is good. I didn't install the soap dispenser but it did seem cheap. Over all, good value."
3,Not up to my expectations.,"First, I must state that I trememdously enjoy Kenny Rogers. This DVD was a disappointment. Here is the listing:It's You and Me and it's Christmas - Kenny RogersSweet Little Jesus Boy - Trishas YearwoodSilent Night - Kenny RogersThe Old Man's Back in Town - Kenny Rogers, Garth Brooks & Trisha YearwoodThe Birth of Christ - Boys IIChristmas in the Air - Kenny RogersThe First Noel - Boys II Men with Kenny RogersWhite Christmas - Garth BrooksCarol of the Bells - ChoirO' Holy Night - Kenny RogersI prefer traditional Christmas songs, and Kenny Rogers only sang three of those (Silent Night, Winter Wonderland & O' Holy Night). Kenny hosted some inner city youths and much of the DVD was directed at them.Additionally the audio CD is NOT a Christmas CD. It is just Kenny Rogers regular songs, and not his best hits."
2,Kenny Rogers,"This was a disappointment in that Kenny did not dominate the program with his talent and songs but rather to his dedication to philanthropy. Of course, caring about others at Christmas does have merit, but if you are looking for great songs go elsewhere. There is some nice variety and pleasant dancing numbers, but not nearly enough."
2,You get what you pays for...,"Well, you buy cheap wipers, you get cheap wipers. Lesson learned.And shame on Amazon for shipping 5 wipers in 5 seperate boxes."
2,It needs some help,"I would first like to say that i am HUGE musical theater nut, and i therefore have an open mind to everything (musically and in general). But i am also a trained opera singer so when music is badly written it REALLY bothers me. Ok, the cd... The song ""Fame"" is very well done, unfortunatly, it all kind of goes down-hill from there. I am not going to knock any of the singers, they are all very talented young people and i dont dare insult my fellow x-generations. My objection to this musical is the MUSIC. It gets repeditive in parts, some notes are held too long, some songs arent long enough. My recomendation for this CD: wait until the show comes out on broadway, by that time they will have fixed most of its little ""musical problems"" and it will be very good (i hope). But as for this version, save your money."
1,AWFUL,"I think I figured out why none of the cast members aren't famous... they can't sing! Who casted this? They need to be fired. We need fresh voices WITH TALENT to portray Broadway's up and coming. Believe me, the characters in this show won't be 'makin it' anytime soon."
4,Don't judge the production by this recording!,"I saw the American touring company in Boston last night (""press night"") and was blown away. I have seen every musical that is currently up and running on Broadway and have yet to see a show that surpasses Fame in terms of energy, enthusiasm, or even sheer, all-around talent. (And you thought Rent had energy??). The only weakness of the show is that it doesn't follow through on or develop many of the story lines (but that would, of course, take a few more hours and considering the time they had, I think they did a pretty decent job). This recording, however, doesn't do justice to the the outstanding production. The energy and talent simply doesn't transfer well to CD. But please, I almost made the mistake of passing up an opportunity to see Fame because I was upset with the quality of the recording...don't make the same mistake! I'll admit, the music sounds pretty corny in your stereo, but when you see it live...wow. Go see Fame."
5,Remember My Name!,"I was given this CD a while after seeing the musical at the Victorian State Theatre in Melbourne. Seeing the show definitely captured my spirit and made me want to be in the theatre! The songs definitely do grow on you. My favourite has to be ""In LA"" where Carmen Diaz sings of her lost dreams and what she's become after being taken advantage of. This CD's been on constant rotation for the past few days, always reminding me of the magic of the theatre - I've only been once! I'll go see anything that has Kelley Abbey in it though - she's the REAL Carmen Diaz!"
4,FAME - The Musical will Live Forever,"Among all the recent versions of FAME I've seen this was the best. I loved the choreography the characters and all the different types of music blended into one tasty morsel. Though this show didn't keep me as interested as RENT did The musical numbers were very catchy like ""I can't keep it down"" and ""Hard Work"" This recording I must agree isn't as satisfactory as other musicals but hey at least I can be reminded of how good the show was. I think Fame - the musical will be around for a loooong time"
3,Not the the movie had some years ago,The movie Fame bounced off the screen and its music engaged its public. Fame the Musical comes later in a different era and does not have the same verve the movie did. Still one can listen to the dance music and imagine the routines.
1,A Poor Attempt At A Great Musical - Robert Edmunds,"After hearing the first two tracks of this recording , I immediately grabbed my copy of the London Cast Recording and played it 3 times in a row! I expected much more of this CD, considering the reviews that I have read previously, and that most Broadway and American recordings are sometimes a lot better than British ones. The singing is very weak and the orchestrations are really lousy. It is almost as if the musical director has a completely different score in front of him. There are, however two tracks that save the day - ""These are my Children"" and the Finale ""Bring on Tomorrow"". However, if you want to listen to a first class production, DON'T buy this!"
3,"Ummmmm, Try the London Cast!","Well, what can I say?! I am a true FAME fan, and I live for it in England. Lets just say that this version does not quite match up to that of the Original London Cast (if you ask me you have to be amazing to beat Loraine Velez). If your not convinced with this version you should see the London casts - there is so much energy in the show and it comes through in the recording. Dont judge FAME by this recording because what I have heard does in no way match up to the London cast. The cast is full of very talented performers, and they are demanding songs. I love the songs and think that they are well done but I think I am still commited to my London cast CD."
5,Love it,Fame was my favorite television series when I was growing up. When I heard the musical was coming to Indy I immediately bought tickets and the cd. It is WONDERFUL and even though the musical won't be here till June I am pumped.
2,Two words...,"...European cast. Avoid the US version of ""FAME"". The sound quality is severly lacking. Pick up the European cast version instead. The European cast CD has the exact same tracks on it PLUS a dance remix of the title song."
1,"FAME, the stage musical, is trying to cash in on the movie.","I was really hoping for something special when I bought the CD for the stage musical FAME. Boy, was I disappointed. There is not ONE song that remotely compares with the quality of the original Michael Gore score for the movie. Even the songs for the TV show were better! This CD about high school kids sounds like it was written BY high school kids. Very weak, very obvious rip-***s of concepts gone before. I'm sure that on stage the cast has energy, but on disk the lyrics (embarrassing rhymes) and melodies (nothing remotely intelligent) are just poor. Some of the voices are OK, but its hard to listen to Regina Le Vert's damaged voice for an entire track. I'm sorry, but FAME should be called LAME!"
4,AWESOME RECORDING! MUST LISTEN TO!,"I love this cd! I have seen the original musical (on video) to the musical to FAME and man, this recording is a GREAT!!!! I HIGHLY recommend it!"
2,This will never be the movie,"I have listened to 3 versions of this musical and seen 1, I've read the script and played the music. and it all boils down to the point that the musical is too much of a bad spin off of the movie. It saws that the movie isn't real life and that the musical is. But in fact the movie is by far more realistic than the musical, so please unless don't by this cd expecting to hear the award winning music of Micheal Gore from the movie FAME because you'll be dissapointed when you hear at most 30 secs of the movies music."
3,Good for a laugh,"She's really funny, but I didn't appreciate her choice of language in some instances."
2,"Content was good, but found some language offensive.","I purchased two copies of this book, one for myself and one for my best friend. I'm sorry to say that I won't be able to give it to my friend after reading just two chapters I found the language to be too offensive. Not once in my life as a Mom have I found a time when the word ""GD"" was necessary or appropriate, and I was surprised to find it used in this book. There was nothing in the online review that suggested this type language, disappointed customer here."
4,Works wonderfully,"There are no glitches, the battery life is amazing, and my film shots turn out great! Does everything you need as a film/digital photographer."
3,more than expected,This unite is a great addition to anyone's photography equipment. It works great for standard portrait photography. I would give it 5 stars if I could set the unite for A/P in the flash measuring mode. I often use a set aputure and wish to know the shutter speed.
3,Great product,"One of the basic toool for any begining or prof, give you the perfect info on the spot, no more guess, just shoot..."
4,Great first light meter,This has been a very good light meter with great results. It is very simple to use. The construction is all plastic but does not feel cheap. When I saw Carlos Baez using the same meter at a seminar it was very reassuring. If it's good enough for one of the best fashion photogs in the world it's good enough for me.
4,Nice to finally have a light meter,"I'm liking it so far. Glad I can take the guesswork out of my exposures.Only thing I want to warn (and I haven't spent time to see if there's a work around): there's no shutter between 60 and 30 to choose. I shoot at a 50 shutter speed pretty much all the time (video), and it's not a huge deal to compensate for it, but I wish I had the choice. Didn't see any mention of it (wouldn't matter much to a photographer) so I figured I'd point it out.Otherwise it's cool. Definitely feels plastic and not built like a tank, but I mean... it's a light meter. It's fine."
4,Worthwhile investment,"Have been recently diving into studio photography. Using the camera meter can be tricky since camera meters can be wrong at times. this is one of the reasons the pros urge the use of meters for portrait photography. My experience with the L-358 has been a great one. have done a few portrait shoots and the quality of the L-358 metered images is much better than that of any portrait work I've done beforehand. So, if you are looking to even just ""dabble"" in portrait photography, this is a good investment. And sekonic seems to have a good reputation from what I've researched.From Chicago with love"
4,Light Meter,Excellent meter. Should be for a professional photographer and not recommended for the person that is not a dedicated 24/7 shooter
5,Perfect,This is truly a fantastic product with top quality features. I have had mine for over 10 years now and not a single complaint. I have used it in many situations to measure light and perfect my shots. I can't imagine going anywhere to do a shoot without it.
2,Look somewhere else,"I love this artist. I watch his movies and listen to his songs whenever I get the chance. I have some of his movies, and I went to watch them in theaters all over Mexico. I have many of his tapes and CDs. I wasn't enough. This selected clips are fine and the narration is good. The restoration work is horrible. I've watched many of the films the clips were extracted from. I'd guess that this studio? didn't spend $5. pesos on the work. Some clips remind of when I watched the movie and 50 people, sitting in front of me, were all smoking. The great Mariachi bands sound really bad. I guess that, maybe, 10 minutes of video were clear and sharp. This could have been a wonderful viewing experience. Perhaps after reading this the company will hire more competent people."
3,Juan Brujo could have done it better.,"The real reason anyone would buy this cd is for the 2 new songs performed by Brujeria. So, I did it. And boy, what a difference. This is not Brujeria. The track #8, Marcha de Odio, is nice, but not Brujeria's fast and furious style. And track #11, Don Quijote Marihuana, is a joke. I won't even waste time talking about it. The other songs are nice. But if you want the best songs in this cd: Puya; Montate, and Calavera. Sorry, Juan Brujo, but if your new cd is going to be like the song Don Quijote Marihuana, don't even put it on sale."
3,Extensive but a little boring,"The book does contain a ton of Christmas songs. I had hoped for more unfamiliar traditional ones, but that gap is filled with 20th century Christmas pop songs.The arrangements are okay, not necessarily too easy, just too soundless. All in all, this is probably a good book for beginners who don't want to struggle with complicated harmonies and sheet music."
4,...,I haven't have to use to escape a submerged car but the window punch shattered rigid plastic bottles easily and the cutter is sharp.
5,ResQMe,"Seems to be a practical safety device for safe exit of vehicle if submerged and electrical power to window lifts is disabled. Kinda bulky on a keychain, though."
5,Great safety device,"Great safety device, hope I never have to use it. Lots of canals here in Florida, a must for every driver."
5,wife loves,I got this for my wife because of her fear of bridges and sinking in a car. it is a very convenient design.
5,i love it,good quality and good design. i love it when i first seen it. and i had it on my keychain for 2 mouths. still working good and look nice.
4,a great safety item for every one,"This is a great little seat belt cutter and window break car safety tool for your key chain or EDC preparedness kit/bag!! It's like the American Express slogan from back in the day...""never leave home without it!"""
4,I never leave home without it,This tool lives in my pocket and goes where I go. So far I have not had to use it but it is good to know that I have it with me. I like the design and ease of use. Everyone needs to have something like this just in case.
4,ResQMe escape tool,"Nice tool. I purchased one for each vehicle. Tested it and it worked very well. I did not realize how small, 3 inches in length, and lite it is from advertisement - very convient . I feel alot better having this tool in our vehicles."
1,Wasn't what I needed.,"Returned, Did not serve the purpose I needed. Maybe too high of expectations here. Seemed to be poorly built. Did not keep."
1,???,how the heck do you use this thing?? im afraid i may break it trying to figure it out-is this a joke! it looks like it cost less than a dollar to make!! instructions???????????ps regular life hammer is excellent
2,Still wondering how to use it,"I purchased two for both cars, still wondering how it works. I will purchase a larger one locally, one that I feel I can trust when needed."
1,not such a good idea,This will no doubt become a favorite of car thieves everywhere. I hope that I can find a keychain mounted blowtorch to accompany this.
4,Great Product; Makes you feel a little safer,"I purchased this for many reasons; hopefully I will never need to use it for myself, but should I need to I feel it will do what it needs to do.I think the design is very good; just wish it was a little smaller because it is kind of bulky to have on my keychain.Overall great product, tested the glass punch and it does what it is supposed to, once it pops out it goes right back in and is ready to be used again."
4,ResQMe,This is very handy insurance to keep with you or in the car. You don't know when you might need it. I bought one for everyone in the family.
5,Hope I never have to use it.,"I picked up a couple of the ReQMe's after seeing a video on them and all I can say is that they are a handy little tool that I hope I never have to use. Great part is that they are handy, lightweight and easy to carry.I put one on my keychain and one on my wife's. I will likely be giving some as gifts for Christmas to make sure all my friends and their families are prepared as well. This is one tool that everyone should have on their keychain."
4,Lightweight and sturdy,"When i ordered this product I thought it was metal and was scared it was going to be heavy on my keychain. I have never used this in an emergency and that is great but this is lightweight, looks very sharp, safe and sturdy. Would give 5 stars but don't know if it actually will brake a window but probably as you can not push the front down by hand takes some force."
3,It's OK!,I haven't had to use this in an emergency so I can't testify to how well it would work in that circumstance. But it is nice and small and easy to find because of it's color. My only complaint is that the directions don't explain how to use it. I am guessing that you just push the black end against the glass and something happens to break the glass but it doesn't say and I am not going to try it on my window unless there is an emergency.It is nice and inexpensive and small which is great.
3,Keyring Size ResQ Me Car Escape Tool,"As I have not had to use this product, thank goodness, it is hard to totally write a review. However, it fits easily on my keyring and makes me feel more secire that I have it. It appears easy to use, and is readily handy. Hope I never have to use it, but security is important."
5,Seems like a great product.,If it works in an emergency I will update this review. If it doesn't work then I will be dead and will find it difficult to make further comments.
5,Safe exit from a car accident,"I was in a driver-side car accident, totaling the car,and was afraid that I couldn't get out of the seat belt. This little tool on my key chain will always be handy so I never need worry about that again."
4,Sweet Customer Service,"The tool is even smaller than I expected, and it has a very clear guidance. Here is my purchase experience: I left a critical review after I received the car escape tool without contacting the seller. The seller took my review really serious and tried to fix this immediately. He promised to ship me a whole new one, so I'm here to revise my review. Lovely customer service! And it's pretty amazing that this small thing can save our lives when we trapped in the car."
4,"Compact, should do the job","I wanted this tool for peace of mind with my two small kids in the car, in case I needed to extract them from carseats quickly. It is a small enough size to stay on my keychain, and I have confidence that it will do the job of cutting seatbelts and/or breaking windows as needed. I gave the item 4 stars instead of 5 because the instructions, although they came in several languages, actually didn't illustrate how to use the window-breaking mechanism properly and I ended up stabbing my thumb with the little pointy part that is supposed to stab the glass. Luckily it didn't break the skin on my thumb."
1,Mine is broken,The spring-loaded head does not push back. I used a flashlight and looked inside and noticed that the pin is not centered with the hole in the middle of the hammer head which is the cause to why the spring-loaded head does not push back. I'm very angry about receiving a defective product.
3,ResQMe tool,"Item was small. Not what I expected. Gift item. However, person receiving wanted to keep it. Needs better description or else highlight measurements."
1,this sucks,it dosent even brake the glass and when it does deploy it only leaves a slight divot and then it doesnt reload like the box says it does
4,What if you can't put your car in park to release the key chain from the ignition?,"This product is a wonderful idea. I bought one for my 17 year old daughter and one for me. However, a major design flaw - if you keep this on your key chain - how will you disengage the key chain if the car is in drive, which it would be if you were in an accident or went into water. Who would think to put their car in park, if you could, in order to get to the ResQMe? While I liked the idea of the key chain version, it's better to keep it hooked to something else. Don't put it in the console or glovebox. If they pop open on impact, you could lose the contents of both and then what good would it do? I think they should have come up with another way to keep this in your car. For now, I have it attached to my turn signal arm with a rubber band. At least until I come up with a better solution."
3,I doubt if it is powerful enough to break the car window,"It designed small, but I doubt if it is powerful enough to break the car window. I don't want test it on my car, wondering if the manufacturer tested?"
3,Can't wait to be trapped underwater!!,Since I haven't been able to try it out in a life or death situation I give it three stars. If I die- then it gets a 1 star. If I live it will get five.
3,Great Family Film idea...that went astray too frequently,"I feel mislead by the other reviewers. I was excited to have a new family film highlighting great values with a child on a wonderful, brave mission. The movie would have done that had it not inserted SEVERAL crazy incidents into the story line. Two of my girls (10 and 8) woke up talking about how there were many things that didn't belong and another daughter said parts of it were scary. The sad thing is that most of the scary parts were completely out of place. There was plentiful violence: knife, gun, attempt to kill the president and then the van blowing up. Did everyone miss that the boy, who was on a mission to do good, threw a firecracker into the front seat of another car? The base story line was wonderful and inspiring, but there were too many incidents that WERE out of place- I am guessing this was for ratings. There were so many events that were never developed and should have been removed."
2,FIRST DOG,"FIRST DOG - Poor acting, bad plot, juvenile to say the least. Too long for so little excitement and rather stupid plot."
4,review,it was new like it said and the grandsons enjoyed watching it. I don't have anymore words to say about it.
4,Great Java Book for IBM mainframers,"I have many of Mike Murach's books and I like the way they are organized. I would recommend this for any IBM mainframe programmers trying to learn Java (like me). I am still reading it, but am positive this is the one of many Java books you need to have."
4,Good textbook with minor errors and not very consistent structure,I am taking my Begining Java Class now and we use this textbook. Overall book is good although with some errors in text and some of the code is hard to understand without whole program code. My instructor studied on previous edition and said that previous edition was better structured.
4,The best book to start in java,"When I began studying Java, a friend of mine recommended me this book and it was perfect because I could learned the essential Java skills, object-oriented programming, Swing and so on. Besides, I could understand how to work with float values in my business application by using the class Big Decimal in order not to lose precision and digits.Therefore, I can confidently say that this book is an excellent choice for learning Java and developing high quality software."
3,Not Good For A Beginner,"If you are a new programmer and need the source code to check your work and to make sure that you are even on the right track, then this book is not for you. There is really no way to check your work because Murach's does not give out the source code. They only will do this if you pay approximately $1500 for the Instructors Kit & you must be an Instructor or Professor.If you are somewhat comfortable with your programming skills and do not need to check your work then this book might be ok for you but there are many other good books on the market for proficient programmers."
4,Vent visors,My only complaint is Amazon doesn't make it clear if there are for the rear or front windows. Easy to install and protect the interior if you want to leave your windows cracked
3,Not for kids much older than 5,"While I agree about the clarity and coverage cited by the other reviewers, I take issue with the book's age recommendation of ""5 and over"". My grandson is 7 and finds this book much to basic. It was still nice, but I think the age recommendation should be 4-6 in my opinion."
5,Awesome book,"Simple, to the point book about the Earth, day/night. My 4 year old son understand it well and it is easy for him. It got him interested in learning more about space."
3,Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science Book,"Reason for Reading: Ds read aloud to me as his non-fiction reader.This book is still in print but has been completely revised and is not the same as the old edition we have here. A simple, easy-to-read introduction to the earth's shape and how it revolves to create night and day, sunsets and sunrises. An experiment with a lamp is used to further illustrate the process. This book was fairly easy for ds to read and gave him a chance to practice reading using a conversational voice. He also knew the information and it caused him to initiate dialogue to expand upon the basic observations and impart his own knowledge. I love this series of books; they are excellent easy readers in the science field and Branley is a good, interesting writer of non-fiction material. Branley was the originator of the series."
1,too expensive and no return call.,Could have recieved this same book for $.99 online. I called the company and left my call back number but never recieved a call.
5,decorating bag,"Not only good for decorating cakes, bur great for cookie dough, deviled egg filling, etc, etc.P.S. I'm a 2 finger typer & refuse to write a dissetation on anything. PERIOD!!!Joseph"
4,Very good quality,This is a good quality bag and very easy to use. Love the support in the tip. I would definately recommend.
5,A+ item,"I'm a professional baker, and I love these reusable pastry bags. If you don't mind washing these out instead of using disposable bags, they will be worth the investment! Buy a few and in different sizes! Works with many decorating tips, I recommend using ""couplers"" as well. Couldn't live without them!"
2,Poor Value for Money,I purchased this for my wife for a birthday present. She has a variety of videos of this type but not this specific one. Other videos she has purchased have been 30 minutes long for the price paid. This video was only 1 routine for 15 minutes for the same price as others with 30 minutes. Very disappointing.
1,Dissappointed,"I ordered what I thought to be a keyboard holder, but all I received was the mounting bracket for a tray which is not included. When contacting Amazon, I was told I was correct but I was sent another bracket without the tray for the keyboard. I returned both items for credit."
5,More info on Quiller series at www.quiller.net fan site,"There is a lot more info on the Quiller series at www.quiller.net, a fan site."
2,Not his best,"I have the Quiller books and have reread them all. This one does not hold up. It is slapdash, the characters are mere stereotypes, the rebellious nature of the hero comes off as pathetic rather than independent minded, and there is much too much time spent talking about karate moves. My general rule for Quiller is the nearer the middle of the series of novels you are, the better I enjoy it. The earlier ones are a bit dated, and the later ones the author did not do enough work on, and come across as outlines."
3,Short term solution - not enough value for the money,"I was looking for a way to transport my 9-month old when I had drop off my 3 year old at preschool, but remain hands-free. This fit the bill for that, but definitely has some drawbacks. I had a hard time finding a comfortable position for me and my baby - she was always too low so her face was in my chest...I probably just need to spend more time on finding the right position. Once in though - it does allow you to be hands free which was my original goal. The other problem I think I'm about to run into is I live in Ohio and winter is coming...not sure how this is going to operate over a coat - and will probably need to keep adjusting depending on what coat I'm wearing... The other thing I'm starting to think is that when my baby is walking - not too far off, I probably wouldn't use this at all...So in the end, kind of an expensive item for short-term limited use."
1,"Sorry, But Not This Time","Okay no offense, Strieber can write. His creative genious is envious. But this book really sunk. The sequel to this book was really much better.This one left me confused and wanting backstory like crazy. I was only able to understand what happened in THIS one because I read the sequel FIRST. Although, if you want to spend time inside the mad, self-righteous mind of the vampire Miriam Blaylock (I highly recommend it!) you'll be fascinated and horrified all at once. She's the kind of villain you'll love to hate, and she makes Lestat look like a sweet angel by comparison.-LV"
1,"Mr Strieber, this sucked (pardon the pun).","This was my first vampire novel (but I'm not new to the horror genre) and my suspicions of novels as such has been confirmed - I don't find it frightening!The Hunger isn't your average vampire novel. In the story, vampires (there's only two) can get a nice tan, they don't kill by biting their victim in the neck, the 'fake' vampire even ages . . . and they eat (drink is more like it) once every six days!! Don't you think these are boring characteristics for a vampire? It completely eliminates the scare-factor and by eliminating the scare-factor, the novel metamorphose from a horror story to a drama. It was this change in story-telling that frustrated me the most. Even though there are traces of lesbianism, telepathy, mind-control - which spices up the novel- it STILL WASN'T good enough to make the story interesting!!! This brings me to my conclusion: IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD VAMPIRE NOVEL, LOOK ELSEWHERE."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A really interesting take on the vampire, and the decline of their raceand the depredations it drives them too. More Interview With TheVampire, than Nosferatu.One of the last of their race, a woman still has needs for malecompanship. While functionally immortal, her vampiric powers decline,so that she can only give ever lessening longevity with vitality to hercompanions.What she keeps in her basement is not very nice."
5,Excellent,"I found this on an ""Impulse"" rack at the grocery store. I am so glad that I did. It is an excellent book. I can't wait to read The Last Vampire (just ordered it). This is a different sort of vampire story. Even though Miriam is a vampire there is some sort of a sentimental quality she has regarding the ones she loves. You almost feel sorry for her."
4,Taste vs. Price,"I have been a big fan of Ramune for years. This is a lower-sugar, less-in-a-bottle drink that is good for anyone on a diet or just wants to lessen their sugar intake. Popping open the bottle is also pretty fun for anyone. Don't be worried about the marble, there are more kids who choke on pop tabs than get hurt from the marble each year (in fact, I have yet to find a report about anyone being hurt by the marble).The only problem I can see with buying this product here is the price. I went to my local (1 hour drive away) Asian grocery and bought this product for a mere $8. Yes, a 6-pack for $8. The price online is NO BARGAIN. I would suggest looking elsewhere if you would like to try this delicious treat."
5,Nick Jr Favorites are always a hit with kids,"Back when my kids used to watch these shows, this video was out all the time. Max and Ruby is still a favorite in our household, but mostly they have outgrown these shows now they are both in school. My favorite is the Yeti Backyardigans, which is a show that truly fosters imagination in young people. I'm holing on to this one so that my grandkids will get to enjoy it too."
4,Not brand name as advertised,"These bags are OK. But they are not as advertised. The page about these bags on Amazon says they are ""Sharp EC10PU"" but in fact the bags I received from B&M Housewares after ordering from this Amazon page, were a brand I never heard of called ""Micro Lined"" and the bag says they are ""designed to fit Sharp models using bag type PU-2."" So a more honest listing for this item should say they are generic or should state their true brand, or should say they are designed to fit Sharp. It should not misleadingly say they are Sharp bags."
2,NOT Sharp bags!,The description says Sharp bags and the picture shows Sharp brand bags but these are not! They are an after-market brand of bags made to fit Sharp vacuums. Not genuine Sharp bags.
2,wrong product originally shipped,"when I realized that I could not get these bags locally since Sharp does not sell vacuums anymore I purchased these on lineObviously I was out of bags when I realized this, The first shioment was bags for a canister. While the product was replaced the error costed a considerable amout of time, Product works fine just took too long to get it because of a mistake"
5,Great sevice,The (hard to find)vacumn bags were exactly what I needed at a great price....shipment was quick!
4,Vaccum Bags,The Vacuum Replacement Bags arrived on time and are being used in our Sharp Vacuum Cleaner in a satisfactory manner.
5,These Vacuum Bags Really Suck!,These Sharp vacuum replacement bags were purchased in a pack of 10 at an incredibly good price. Well worth it!
2,Two reasons I am disappointed in this item,"This would be very attractive except what you don't see in the foto of the item is the manufacturer's ugly black logo on the bottom of one side of it. It says ""Vic Firth Gourmet."" Ruins the nice clean white appearance. Second, it doesn't really grind the salt very well. It is only marginally better than a simple dish of coarse salt with no grinding, perhaps no better. The salt just sort of falls out of it. Note that this is not a cheap item."
3,Just O.K.,"I had high hopes that I would finally end my search for a truly excellent pepper mill after hearing a story about Vic Firth on NPR. I love the design as well as the Mario Batali signature. But this product doesn't meet my expectations. When the grind is set to fine, it takes too long to get the pepper out. And when you loosen it up a little, you start getting big chunks of pepper. I can't seem to get a medium grind with a high flow rate."
5,Looks Great and Works Well,"Very easy to mount on the wall and I am very pleased with how it looks. I don't seem to have any problem hanging robes or even big towels on the hook. One should simply drape the towel horizontally rather than vertically, otherwise it will indeed slip right off like another reviewer mentioned. If you are replacing your bathroom hardware be sure to look at the whole ""Retreat"" collection that Moen has."
3,Slippery little guy!,"We hung this hook on the back of our bathroom door and the towel that hangs off it slides off all the time. I love the look, but we'd probably be better off just using a basic towel hook."
2,not much,"small compact nice looking unit.not as big,and oversized as the nikon flash units.absolutely no difference in the flash intensity regardless of settings on the flash unit,or the camera.ttl,full flash,or 1/16,every flash is full blast.purchased,and tried a diffuser,and results were the same.tried on a partly sunny day,and all pictures were extremly overexposed.saved a few pictures from the session,by turning the flash head 90 degrees straight up."
1,This item is mistitled,This item is actually Mutant Disco Volume 4 --Mutant Disco Volume 4It is not the 7 disc box set of the French artist Lio.
4,"Not outstanding, but definitely above one star!","PLEASE DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE BELOW REVIEW WHEN DECIDING IF YOU SHOULD PURCHASE THIS CD! The person is apparently going by the audio samples! I have this CD and the sound is SUPERB! It's not up to the digital standards of current music, but what recordings from that era are? (And there are NO incomplete songs on the disc.) The only real complaint I have with this collection is that most of the songs are in the same vein. Given a few hundred cuts to choose from, the makers decided to go with nearly all pop/ballad type songs. No instrumentals are included, and not much faster paced, swing-ier type songs included... Oh well, at least they had enough sense to leave it in mono instead of going for pseudo-stereo effects."
5,Best book I ever read,"Two sisters are drawn to a doll in an old shop,buy it,and all these weird thing happen some are bad.There aunt gives the famliy a house and the girls have visions of somone elses memerey.One of the sisters gets pulled into a room of the house and finds out all the troble was coming from Hester(another twins friend)Hester is a gost but is for given for killin a past twin and goes away.Turns out there were many twins in there famlies past and one always died but these did not. It is better than I make in sound."
4,"Ecstasy, Passion & Pain","This early 70's r&b band was taken under the wing of Philly music man Bobby Martin, who had been used to full effect by hitmakers Gamble & Huff of 'Me & Mrs Jones' plus dozens more..with songs reminiscent of Melba Moore, Staples Singers, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight...any classic R&B fan cant go wrong with this release!"
1,Enhance your screen - I think NOT!,This product diminishes the image quality of your LCD to such a point you may as well not use the LCD to judge the quality of the photo you just snapped. It creates a grainy look to your LCD - if you need a screen protector look elsewhere. Consider using a completely clear protector so that your LCD is protected but not altered.
3,An easy read,"This is somewhat interesting regarding the 'castrati' of the period - it has a quirky ending, and is easy to read, and is certainly a passable 'aircraft read'."
3,Idle for a few hours in the Doge's Venice,"This was a nice little mystery set in Venice during the 1700's. It introduced me to a world, opera and castrati, that I knew nothing about. The descriptions of Venice during Carnavale and the political intrigues were rich and wonderful. Also, I like the way Tito's family was integrated into the story. It made him and the situation more alive. And with all this background material, Myers still kept the mystery compelling enough for me to keep turning pages. I was a very pleasant way to idle away a rainy Saturday."
4,The Castrati,"Interrupted Aria: A Tito Amato Mystery (Tito Amato Series), by Beverle Graves MyersInterrupted Aria: A Tito Amato Mystery (Tito Amato Series)was a trip through a historical aspect I have never encountered before. Although I have heard of the Castrati, I have never heard much about their trainig, where they might have come from, or anything about what their lives might have been like during or after their careers as singers. Myers gave me a three-dimensional insight into what that might have been, but also into what life in 18th Century Italy might have been. Tito's confusion, his emotions about his condition, his talent, his skill, his rage at his losses, his joy in his ability to excell and entertain...all weave a lovely tapestry of depth and dimmension in a colorful past. I felt every feeling, heard every sound, loved every minute of it. I hope you will also. Amazon.com, Kindle books, and we, the readers win again."
4,A starred performance,"Interrupted Aria: A Tito Amato Mystery (Tito Amato Series)One shudders to think of the agony that these young men went through in an attempt to save their clear bell-like soprano voices. One also wonders how many were sucessful and how many were mutilated to no effect.I would have liked to hear more about Tito's preparation at the Academy, but this story is nevertheless enjoyable and the Venetian color is authentic"
2,NOT the 1930 Film,"Be careful, folks. Despite the packaging and description, this is NOT the 1930 film but a 1958 film of the same name also starring Albers. The plot is different, too: Albers is a policeman forced into retirement who is determined to find a ripper-type killer. It's an OK movie, but I wanted the 1930 film!"
1,Nothing more than a piece of plastic!,"This ""mousepad"" was nothing more than a thin piece of plastic. It doesn't cling to the desk, but slips around all over the place as you are trying to use the mouse. Although we wanted a small mousepad, it needs to be another inch in each direction to fit the mouse properly so you don't keep falling off the pad."
2,Slides around on lapdesk,"My wife and I both use laptops on wood-surfaced lap desks. We both currently use traditional mouse pads which function fine, but take up too much space. I ordered two of these for us, and although the size is perfect, they don't stick to the wood surface, and instead slide around as we try to move the mouse.They might work on another surface, but for us they were useless."
4,good,I like the creativity of the show. Being that I am a hairstylist myself I can relate to this show.
3,A Good Mix of Music,"This CD has a nice mix of music though isn't quite what is advertised. The handbell is primarily background accompaniment. Many arrangements are a bit slow or lacking in energy. Now that there are samples, you should get a good idea of the music."
3,Christmas sampler,This CD is not exactly what I had expected but am still satisfied. The songs are plentiful but brief.
3,Sitar on the Been !,"True Rudra Veena music is dead. No beenkars exist who have not been exposed to Sitar or Sarod. Instrument makers have mostly forgotten how to make a bamboo Been. In this context, two of the most famous and popular beenkars are free to define their own style of Been playing (and Been construction !). Bahauddin Dagar plays a Been which is stylistically and structurally heavily influenced by the Carnatic Saraswati Veena. Asad Ali prefers the Sitar idiom. I did not find this recording very distinctly different from what is expected of an alap on the Sitar with a heavy emphasis on phraseology and Sitar style ornamentation. Though the music is good, using Asad Ali's own standards, it is not exceptional. I believe the closest representation which exist of the Been ideal is the recording of Puriya by Shamsuddin Faridi Desai -- incidentally he uses an old bamboo Been."
4,Well designed book,"A very informative and well designed book. I am currently a grad. student in architecture and the ideas presented in this book are very intriguing. It takes a very practical approach to urban design. If this book were coupled with Jane Jacob's The Death and Life of Great American Cities, one could get two different but relevant viewpoints regarding this very important debate, especially in the wake of Modernism."
5,Excellent Book,"This book is an excellent introduction to the nature of urban design.It illustrates, in a concise and simple way, most of the major interventions in urban design beginning with early settlements, and finishing with modern cities. E.G the route to the Acropolis, the extension of the garden of Versailles, the reorientation of Georgian London.Every point is explained clearly using great plans, sections and photographs.The book features many references to the conceptual sketches of artist Paul Klee, which Bacon uses as comparisons for urban concepts.This book had a very positive effect on my understanding of architecture and urban design, and i would recommend it to anyone interested in the field.Bear in mind that it is not a standard history book. It is more light-hearted but that is why i enjoyed it so much."
4,A classic in the urban form studies,Design of Cities is a classic of Bacon in the study of the urban form. The new tendences in urbanism forget many times same of the principal conditions of the place. Bacon in a very simple and sensitive way offers us the keys of a original and elemental way. Writing in the sixties is current also today.
3,Could Be Better,"The book is detailed in description and does have nice sketches of examples, however, to understand the design of each city, one must study the simple sketch for a bit and relate back to the text back and forth. Although this may sound natural and may also make me come off as a person who just doesn't like to read, I feel the book could've provided better examples or diagrams. Sometimes a sketch of an urban plan and one colored arrow just doesn't cut it for everyone."
1,"Fantastic at first, dangerous for 2nd baby","My 19 mo old loved her Snoopy mobile. My youngest daughter (8 weeks old) also loved this mobile, until the hard wheel mount broke and the mobile fell on her head. IF you own this mobile, please check the mount on the crib every time you use it so your baby won't get hurt the way our baby did!"
1,Very cute but over priced mobile,"I purchased this mobile to complete my son's room in the baby snoopy theme. Unfortunately we couldn't use it because the mounting part was too narrow for my son's crib. Look very carefully at the advertisement picture. If your crib has a thicker/wider top than the picture do not buy this mobile as it will not fit on your crib.Additionally the quality is very cheap. The plastic arm is very thin and tapers so much so that if it were to tip grabby hands could easily snap it.I did like that it was a wind up mobile, meaning it did not need batteries to run. The melodies were sweet, soft and soothing.I ended up donating it to the NICU my son was in since they needed mobiles and had beds it would fit on.[...]"
1,Price is Outrageous,I don't know why Amazon has this listed for $65.00...You can get the exact same set at target.com and many other sites for about $20.00. I would never pay this outrageous price!!!!
1,I totally agree with the first reviewer,"The book doesn't tell how to sell or make money like the cover implies,and the information is very basic at best,and is for a complete beginner at auctions and computer use"
2,"Good idea, but not enough went into it.","I got the impression that the idea for this book came together too fast and it went out on the market not well researched enough. Instead of all the technical information, tell me where to go on the web to find collectibles. When I saw the title I had high hopes but it told me what I already know. The pictures were nice but low-quality resolution and really didn't add much to collecting online. Too costly for what it offers."
4,"Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, Book 1)",This book is a great read and very original material. I love the creative different classes of characters. There is great drama between the characters and a very good story line. I highly recommend for anyone that loves fantasy.
1,Lack of realism is the main problem,"The whole thing just looks too artificial and unconvincing. Major characters in the book act as if they are participating in an unnatural show. People bahave awkwardly with the sole aim of keeping the plot moving. The encounter with the Confessor, wandering to attract spirits, capture and torture, the supposedly surprising escape at the end, all appear to be oddly fabricated scenes to make the story complete. Sorry to say that there are a lot of better fantasy novels around."
3,"Good writing, but extremely perverse","The story and the writing style are excellent. The problem is that Mr. Goodkind likes to wallow in depravity. While many other modern authors (eg, Robert Jordon, Guy Gavriel Kay) also deal with cruelty, torture, sexual perversions and the like, they use it to show evil for what it is and ""go on."" Goodkind, however, writes continually about it, focusing on it like some extremely unhealthy obsession with a death camp and its methods.Again, the story is good and the writing is lucid, but he leaves you feeling very dirty afterwords."
1,Pathetic!,"I'll admit it, I only read 250 pages of this book. That's all I could stand. How can this book be compared to good SF/Fantasy writing? The characters were simple-minded fools, and the dialogue between them was excruciating. After reading the final 20 pages, I realized that the hero was betrayed by his jealous brother, the good wizard was his grandfather, his enemy was his father, and he's in love. How sweet. Sound like a B movie? No, B movies are over in 2 hours, this book drags on for over 800 pages! Don't waste your time."
1,SERIOUSLY disappointing,"I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book. Kudos go to the narrator, who does a fabulous job of emoting and expressing a wide range of characters. His performance truly is impressive.That said, the writing is HORRENDOUS. The book lurches from one scene to the next, leaving threads hanging everywhere. The characterizations are flat and inconsistent. Richard (the protaganist) has more modd swings than a drunken manic-depressive. It's sad that this book did well enough to force a series on the world, when there are far, far better authors getting far less attention."
1,Un-necessary cruelty,"When this book came out, I read it, and it stopped me cold. I couldn't continue on with the storyline due to the intensely graphic depictions of cruelty against children. I think it's possible to make a villian seem like a villian without the long, graphic and often tedious depictions of child torture. Not on a crusade here, but reading this book made me want to scrub my brain with soap."
1,Don't waste your time or money,I believe that not4prophet got the review right. This book is really really bad. I can barely imagine what the rest of the series is like. It's like a nightmare of one my high school role playing sessions! Save yourself before its too late!
1,I wish I had read the reviews before buying,"It would have saved me the wasted time that I spent reading this drivel (no insult meant to drivel). The other reviewers' descriptions of the horrible aspects of this book are spot on. There is virtually no character development. And yet, there is also no real scene description either. To the extent there is a plot, it is also poorly developed. Looking back on it, I'm not sure what all of the words on the pages actually accomplish other than filling space. On top of all of that, the writing style and dialogue are infantile. An utter waste of time.Do not repeat my mistake and actually pay for this book. For that matter don't waste your time reading it if it's given to you for free - unless it is to learn how not to write."
3,Goodkind,"While enjoyable and engaging, I found that too much of the book was cumbersome and clunky. The torture scenes at the end seem to have been added simply for page length. A scene near the middle seems to have been added when Goodkind was nearly finished with the book, and realized he had to mention a specific plot device earlier on.Yes, the series gets very Rand-ian later on, but I can't fault a writer for putting his own views into his work. What I take issue with is that he also adopted her style or repetitiveness, and bangs it over your head page after page. The first book is the most formulaic, though there are a few times when individual characters stand out.When there's action, it's good, but it's the time spent needlessly between that can start to grate on the reader. This is another series I'd only recommend to those with lots of time on their hands who don't mind spending hours on 'filler.' Personally, I've decided to start reading and reviewing more straightforward works."
4,Very good indeed...,"I have noted that there have been different ratings of this book, but most of them goes in favour of the author.It was almost worth 5 stars. The story is easy to follow, the characters (just about the right amount of them) are interesting, and there is plenty of action from cover to cover. The torture-chapters were really good....and I wanted it to end...you could almost feel it on your own. Well....just read it!"
5,Wow!,I really like Fantasy books and this one really amazed me with just about everything in it! I liked the use of strong and interesting characters especially the mord-sith. ONLY two things wrong sexually themes destroying a good guiltless book and it tore me up about which books are better: Tolkien or Goodkind?
5,Better than Jordan,"This book is greatly better than the Wheel of Time Series. Over the past four days i have read the first three books in the Sword of Truth series, and it is greatlybetter than Jordan. Jordan seems to be prolonging his series in the effort to only put out more books to make more money. If you want simple fantasy for a simple mind then go with Jordan. If you want good fantasy that does not go on forever withough having any sort of end then go with Goodkind. this is the best series I have since the first Thomas Covenant Trilogy, and before that Dune."
4,Good book,"I throughly enjoyed the book. I felt envolved and absorbed in the plot. Sometimes too much, I was listening to the audio version on my long commute. It is extremely long and I wish that I could have the time to actually read the book, but the unabridged version gave me all of the color. I will buy the next book in the series. It is not a J.R.R. Tolkien caliber book, but it was worth the time."
2,I thought I would like it.,"I saw the TV show and loved it I then heard that it was based off of a book. So I went out and got the book from the library. It is really an imaginative story but... All the character dialogue is the exact same! So its nearly impossible to tell who's speaking. I HATE putting books down especially fantasy books but I couldn't continue with this one it just became so difficult and annoying to read not knowing who's speaking! So I returned it. If you want to have anything to do with The Sword of Truth I I suggest you watch the TV show titled ""Legend of the Seeker."
1,I couldn't finish it,"I bought the book because I started watching the Legend of the Seeker TV show that is based on it and am enjoying it. The book, on the other hand, is awful. I gave up after it took 300 pages just to get through the boundary. The writing didn't bother me too much, it's just so slow moving."
2,Its a start . . .,"Wizard's First Rule is dull. It is overwritten, hackneyed and lengthy. The dialogue rages along like an angry housewife, and it doesn't know when to stop. It goes on and on, and the point is endlessly repeated - ""Do you love me""?, ""Really""? ""Are you sure""?. Moreover, the main character's name is Richard. Of all names, Richard. The battles are few and far between, and they seem to all be the same - a violent mess. The debatable part of the book i.e. the torture scene by the busty dominatrix isn't too overdone. It only adds variety to the climax and a break from the dull dialogue. Chapter after chapter. Despite these glaring faults, it shows that there might be better things to come. Maybe."
3,"The full series gets 5 stars, this book is a weak start to a great epic.","The first book is a tediously slow start to what ultimately becomes a very engrossing and detailed epic. Why then are there many low and mediocre reviews? There is an underlying ideological theme that develops as the series unfolds. The first book takes a long time to develop due to the intricate plot and scope of the full series. Anyone who sees the book as simple, trite, hackneyed, etc. simply does not posses the intellect to comprehend so many contiguous and interwoven storylines, plots and characters. You either get it, or you don't. The underlying ""political"" ideology regarding the evil of a government that dictates ""what's best for the common good of the people"", will bring cheers from those more conservative minded readers, and jeers from more liberal readers."
2,Overrated,"I can't believe the praises other reviewers have posted here. The book is way too long, underedited, in fact. The author wasted a good number of pages explaining things that are obvious to readers. This style may be beneficial to young fans but with themes like pedophilia and sado-masochism, it is clearly a mature book without the mature writing style. Yes, Mr. Goodkind is inventive in his plot twists and characterizations, the overall plot is a cliche. He also crammed the interesting parts near the end. As a result, the ending was rushed since too many important events are happening without much explanation. Probably because he devoted too much time on the little things (a crime the Wheel of Time series is also guilty of). I'd rather read Feist's books. Even if the plots are cliche, they are still good reading..."
1,"had possiblilties, but far too graphic and perverse","The book started pretty good, an interesting (but at times illogical) tale of Seeker trying to stop an evil force. Unfortunately, the tale begins to get into graphic scenes of torturing children, and a lot of gratuitous torture of hero by an evil mistress. I gave up on the book at this point. This book is not fit for children, teenagers, or anyone else for that matter."
1,I don't understand,"I truly don't understand how The Sword of Truth series has made a millionaire out of Terry Goodkind. It is a mockery of epic fantasy, with tired, overworked cliches and little to no originality. Characters in children's novels are more original and interesting: Curious George comes to mind. Even worse is his writing style. It's sophomoric and unrealistic. I sincerely hope that majority of readers that liked this book were below the age of 30. Any rational, sane adult who knows anything about fantasy and/or writing MUST know that this is not good fiction."
1,blah blah blah,Nice little door stopper/paper weight/S&M novel form the writer who apperently thinks that if a book has enouth words in it it will somehow reach criticall mass and become good
3,decent beginning to a bad series,"This 1st book for Goodkind in his SoT series is one of his best. Sadly I recommend NOT reading it since as a series SoT leaves much to be desired.The series deteriorates into cardboard cut out characters with wooden dialogs coupled with inane plots all while punishing the reader with philosophy 101 preached at a grade school level.In short, run (don't walk) away from this series!If however you don't mind reading a couple books and never finishing a series than by all means read Wizards 1st."
5,Where did Goodkind get this?,"The psychodrama in this novel is intense. I could not help but wonder what kind of experiences led Goodkind into delving into this kind of behavior. As I read this book, especially the last 200 pages or so,I couldn't stop thinking, ""Dude, where did you get this?""Wizard's First Rule is worth reading because Goodkind delves into corners of the human psyche where most shrink form exploring. His portrayal of the dynamics between the torturer and the tortured is compelling. But, it's certainly not for the squeamish or faint of heart."
5,Looking for a good fantasy? SEEK NO MORE!,"It's not often that a book blows me away so hard that it immediately jumps up into my top favorites of all times, but this book succeeded.Two or so years ago, my partner and I watched ""Legend of the Seeker"" on Netflix. We'd never heard of it before, it was only two seasons and not currently on TV anymore, and it seemed like a fun concept. We loved it!Once I found out that it was based off of a book series, I knew that I just had to read them eventually. After a year of minimal reading (2012, don't ask!) and a bunch of other books, I found the Kindle version I had forgotten that I had purchased.This story has everything you could ask for in a novel: adventure, betrayal, magic, romance, true love, friendship, empathy, wickedness, honor, terror, hope, and so much more.I can't wait to read the rest of the series, and lucky for me, there are QUITE a few! :)"
5,Great read cant wait to start the next book,"I think this book was pretty good. My father told me that when i was little we had a bunch of books by such authors as terry goodkind that he had read and hoped that i would pick one day up and read, but when we moved they ended up ruined by the rain. So i took them and wrote down the readable titles and as soon as i bought a kindle i thought i give it a go with this series first. I am glad i did 5 stars all the way."
3,Good book BUT...,"Although it was a good story, it was written too simplistic. I was able to easily guess what was going to happen next much of the time. This book should be geared for a much younger audience."
3,"An entertaining read, but nothing new","Wizards First Rule has its moments, but for the most part is an uninspired read. The characters are incredibly shallow, and the story is predictable at its best. It always seems like there should be somthing more, some new plot twist that would elevate it to the heights of The Eye Of The World. This twist unfortunatly never came and the ''sadistic'' scenes had little or no shock value depending on your sensitivity. If you are a traditionalist or are new to fantasy you will most likely emjoy it, but otherwise try somthing else. 3 out of 5 stars."
2,"Slightly entertaining, mostly trash","Having never read a Terry Goodkind novel before, I decided to give this one a try. I like long books and moderate length series. I'm just here to say this was a disappointing book. I was left with no desire to read another book by this author, ever. Goodkind clearly has some internal issues that would cause him to write such a disturbed novel. Pointless blood and guts, torture, and S&M nonsense, which lead nowhere in terms of a compelling story."
1,Can you say Jordan wannabe?,"Totally unimpressive. Absolutely no originality whatsoever and the worst map I have ever seen. Several ideas copied from The Wheel of Time. Same old evil mage wanting to take over the world. Same old wimpy hero with a sword not, sure if he can save the world, and going after the girl he can't have. Bah bah bah boring. Save yourself the money and buy Jordan. Would recommend ANYTHING by Robert Jordan, the Shannara Trilogy, Heritage, and Landover series by Brooks, Harry Potter, and the Belgariad and the Malleron by Eddings (the only two series he wrote that were unrepeitive)"
4,Great Escape,"I've been reading 'fantasy' on and off for over 50 years and although Ive been late to discover Terry Goodkind, he is definitly in the top 5 pct. I'm currently reading book three in the series and my enthusiasm has not diminished."
2,"A ""Meh"" worthy book","When reading high fantasy, I rarely have high hopes as to originality of plot, and there were no surprises here. I do generally expect more writing skill and better dialogue than Mr. Goodking bothered to provide. The dialogue seemed forced on almost every occasion; the writing seemed to be that of a sophomore in high school. If it weren't for the low standards I hold the genre to, I would have rated this book as a 1."
5,one of the best!!!,A very good book!!! Lots of details and excitement for all the readers. I highly recommend this book for everyone.
2,Not that good..,"I made the mistake of reading this book after I had completed the first three books in George R R Martins a Song of Ice and Fire series. I was looking for somthing to read while I am waiting for book 4, A Feast for Crows, to come out. Martins supreme writing really shows through. I will suggest this book as a good beginning book to anybody who is new to the fantasy genre. But if you want the best in the business then look toward Martin."
3,BEWARE!,"This book isn't BAD, but as the series goes on, it gets steadily worse. A 3 star rating (for this book, which is an okay read, about neutral) going to a 0 star rating (don't waste your time, really..you'll be disappointed). I would suggest not wasting any money on this book, or any in the series. Goodkind has continued to be a disappointment, and I have decided to never support his writing again. Extreme, but it's THAT bad!"
5,A BLOODY GREAT BOOK,"I believe that Terry Goodkind has done a fantastic job on this book. Even if the story is a TAD predictable in places, most of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting more. I really liked the character Kahlan. She was a very complex character, which added another dimension to the story. Zedd, well he is a dead boring character really. I NEVER guessed that he was who Kahlan was looking for at the start. But really, who, in the real world would have a beatiful women following you around, rare and amazing powers and a whole country of people willing to give up their lives for you, like Richard? Thats what books are for though, to create situations like that, arent they? stuff like that aint gonna happen in the real world. But the book was amusing, and i have now read all of the Sword of Truth books.I have enjoyed them immensely, despite the points i have metioned above!Overall this book is FAB!"
2,Seems boring.,"I haven't gone through it and don't know if I will but anyway, here it goes: For me when I read fantasy the characters have to be interesting, very important. I like Jordan's characters but these ones seemed a bit frail. Also the plot wasn't engaging wich it should have been since it lacked this extraordinary creativity which I think a good fantasy writer should have but maybe I'll like it if I read it through?"
2,Not enough story for its size,"The good things about this book are Goodkind's crafty use of words, the memorable characters and its readability. However, these strengths are outweighed by the fact that the story moves too slowly as you often find yourself waiting for something of importance to happen. If an author is going to write a book of this length, he or she must be sure to keep the plot moving--Goodkind fails in this respect. Also, Goodkind goes beyond an average level of violence to images and events that are graphic, vile and just plain disgusting. What is worse is that these scenes have little bearing on the plot and just seem to be included for shock value. I don't recommend this book because it just isn't worth the time."
2,Disappointed,"I was buying this book for my sister as a birthday present and she only wanted it with the original cover art. On the site, the image of the book was of the original cover art so i assumed that is what i would be getting when i purchased it. When i actually received the book in the mail, i was disappointed to find that it was the new cover art and not the original cover art on the book that my sister had requested, so i had to buy her a completely different present. I was really disappointed. The images shown should be of what you are purchasing."
5,Great epic fantasy,"The sword of truth series is a great epic fantasy series. One book of the series blows because it does not stay with the main characters, but overall the series is one of my favorites."
4,"lack in prose, good plot","it is more like a 3.5 stars, but the first law itself is so right and amuzing, that i had to round it up instead of down.becuse this is a very not good book, which is only saved by the concept of trying to trick your enemy instead of stubbing him with a random sharp piece of metal."
4,Takes a little to get into...,"I first started reading this book on the recommendation of a friend. I read the first quarter of the book and it was just ok for me. I had just gotten done reading The Wheel of Time and I was having a hard time finding another fantasy series that, for me, lived up to that one. I didn't read the book for about a half a year and eventually, after needing something to read, decided to pick it back up again. After getting past the first half I really started to ejoy it and wanted to keep reading it. The bottom line: Its a book worth reading...however BEWARE Goodkind gets VERY philosophical in his later books (7 and on), so if you don't mind reading boring pages upon pages of his philosophy and put the plot and action aside for a few chapters, then by all means continue to read the series!"
5,best book ever!!!!,"This is the best book I ever read! I am a fantasy fanatic and I loved this book! It had sword fights, battles amazing characters and a wonderful plot. I loved it and so did all my friends who read it. Although it had some inappropriate context, the rest of the plot completely made up for it. The rest of the series is not as good as this book, but they are still amazing. I liked them a little more than I liked the LOrd of the Rings, and that is saying something!"
1,Quit now - don't waste your money.,"This is one of the worst fantasy novels I've ever read. Period. The writing is terrible - I can only assume that Goodkind's editor is bound and gagged in a closet somewhere, in desperate need of rescue. Bad grammar is only the beginning - there is no character development, almost no originality, except for some S&M stuff not usually found in the genre, and nothing to recommend this book except for its value for the buck. Goodkind must be getting paid by the word. I will usually finish a series I've begun, but I could barely force myself to finish this book. With all the other great writing and original storytelling out there, there is no reason in the world to waste your money on this series."
5,Really good read,I found out about this book by watching the TV series. I must say I am enjoying this book more. There was so much left out of the TV series that makes the characters more interesting. I highly recommend this book and plan to read the whole series myself.
1,ugh...,"Unquestionably a bad, cliche-ridden book. Put simply so as to not dwell on the obvious; if you are accustomed to intelligent writing, don't bother with this. You can almost SEE the seams in Goodkind's thought processes and transitions. It's one of those books where you spend all your time calling out ""come on!"" or ""give me a break!"" Stay away.In this genre, R.R. Martin is untouchable."
1,What a hack.,"Don't waste your time on Terry Goodkind. He doesn't have an original story element in any of his books. I have read his first several books in the hope of finding something interesting. Unfortunately, he apparently can't come up with his own ideas. If you have read much fantasy, you will recognize ideas he has lifted from Tolkien, Jordan and a number of other authors with actual talent. In some cases it is so blatant that I wonder the other authors don't sue for copyright infringement. Don't waste your time or money on these books. Read the originals."
3,Rehashed poorly,"The book is identical to thousands of other horrible Tolkien knock offs. The plot is arduous and the characters inconsistent. For instance the second main character is supposed to be a bad ass, mysterious and powerful creature. Yet she acts like a dainty maiden whenever its convenient. The author is lazy and unimaginative in a lot of story building. He tends to write every last detail out rather than explain it via literary action."
1,Don't get sucked in. It will damage your soul.,"I'll admit, I was drawn in by the rich fantasy setting and the initially likable characters. And man, I was willing to go through a lot just to stay with that setting. In retrospect, it seems like the only person Goodkind hates worse than his characters is me.If you'll allow me, please direct your attention to the following series SPOILERS:Rich fantasy world, touching relationships, brave champions, torture, rape, a LOT of torture, revenge, separation, RAPE DEMON, scattered torture with a chance of rape, Ayn Rand, reunion, separation, rape, reunion, separation, torture and rape, Ayn Rand.There, I just saved you thousands of pages of trauma. I vaguely remember brief interludes of swords and sorcery heroism thrown in there as well, but, you know... rape demon and all that. Oh, and I'm almost sure that one of the books contained the exact phrase ""tyranny of altruism"". My god."
1,Simply Awful,"This book was just awful. It reads like a bad video game: first you get the whistle, then WHOA, two chapters later you need the whistle ... Then you get the dragon eggs, then two scenes later you need the dragon eggs! Simply pathetic. It's too bad that drivel like this gets published. Not only are the characters uninteresting and one-dimensional, the plot is predictable and the prose is SIMPLY AWFUL. Which, I think, is a fairly good two-word description of this terrible novel."
5,A breath of fresh air to people with an active imagination,"Recommended this book by my Brother, I knew it would be something special and I was not disappointed. From the very beginning your are thrown into the action surrounding the lead character, Richard Cypher, a humble woodsman who finds himself involved in matters he has little or no knowledge of. Despite this he is the only person who has the ability to succeed in a perilous mission. Surrounded by superb characters of different talents, he slowly realises his own abilities and how to use them. This is an incredible book that twists and turns, keeping you enthralled and helping you imagination run wild. It caused me a few late nights (and one early morning!). Probably the best piece of advice my Brother has ever given me, I cannot wait to read the next instalment."
1,first book i've ever thrown out,highly recommended by a local bookstore while waiting for more jordan material. incredibly disappointing.
3,"Not too bad, at least I made it to the end","Not the most original book I've ever read, but it utilizes the standard ""fantasy quest"" elements pretty well. Some interesting twists that I wasn't expecting. A good fantasy worth a try, though not for the faint of heart!"
3,"Wizards First Rule, Book1 of the Sword of Truth","Excellent story with twists and curves throughout. The reader was a bit distracting in his syle of presentation, articulating each word to a point of irritation.But that aside, the characterization was good and the sound levels consistent across the story and all of the disks."
5,truly amazing,i read this book about a year ago and all of the following books within a few months and let me just say they were all fantastic. each novel presents a concept that is parallel to modern society and they truly make you think about your own life and they way you treat certain situations. you start to ask yourself what would richard do? throughout the series there are a number of grammatical errors but that is just as much an editorial issue as it is terry himself and to be honest the books were so amazing it didnt even matter. that being said i highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone that will listen. happy reading!
5,Great Fantasy Novel for S&S fans andy anyone new to the genre,If you enjoy swords and sorcery type novels this one is a don't miss. I started watching the tv show legend of the seeker and saw it was based on this series of books. The show is good but the book is so much more. While not quite on par with the original Shannara books it is still an excellent read. What I enjoyed most about this book is it did have a good conclusion to read as a standalone yet enough questions remained that you will want to read Stone of Tears (book 2). I am reading the second book now and not disappointed.The world is wonderfully created has its own atmosphere and is described in excellent detail. The characters also have a level of depth to them frequently missing in fantasy novels.
4,A great beginning.,"This book is the beginning to what has to be one of the greatest series ever written. I personally loved this book but it's only a start and the farther in the series you get the better it becomes. Goodkind questions, pokes and prods at modern society giving praise to individuality and original ways of thinking. If you've read any Robert Jordan and liked it you'll love Terry Goodkind because the two series are easily comparable and both are amazing."
5,A wonderful read!,"I have to say, I've never been so into a book series that I literally read until I fall asleep, and have to find my place in the book when I wake up in the morning! This was a wonderful book, and the ones to follow just get better! Of course there are some cliche parts, but it was still fantastic!"
4,Somewhat Brilliant,"Many books (especial fantasy) do not inspire as ""Wizard's First Rule"" does. Written by fantasy author Terry Goodkind, is a book filled with adventure and original feeling.The book does follow the time old fantasy cliche' of a young man coming of age. However this does not mean that the book isn't worth reading, by any means Terry Goodkinds original twists make the time old story interesting and fresh.Once you get a feel for the characters, that is- get to know them, one will realize just how good a writer Goodkind is and find yourself wanting more. (I started with this book and ended buying the entire series and just now fineshed them all- and over all I beleive that this book is a read-it-cause-its-damn-good book."
5,Great Book,"This was a great book. Like many people who have read this book recently, I read it because I was interested in the TV show. The book and the TV show are very different. I would not recommend reading the book at the same time as watching the show, it gets confusing.The book was great. An easy read that had my attention and kept me turning the page.Of course there were many times where I felt every thing possible was going wrong for the group of friends, but in the end, as it often does it worked out as it should.You really get to know the main characters. Having seen a lot of the TV series before I read the book I thought I knew what was going to happen. I was wrong.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy."
2,There's far better stuff out there,"Mildly engrossing at times, but the plot is pure soap opera. Not an uncommon problem in the fantsay genre, but each plot ""twist"" is apparent about 150 pages before hand. I struggled to reach the end and will not be finishing the series."
5,A well developed and fully enriched novel.,Having read this book 5 times now I have to say that it is by far my favorite book. The savory development of character interaction allowed for me as the reader to loose myself in the depth of the novel and the story line. A most original plot and point of views from several different angles allows for much thought and a good time. A grade A+ book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I DO!
3,Wizard's First Rule-Great Book,"I thought this book was a great Fantasy book. Goodkind thinks of many ways to present a Wizard's task, and surprises you with many outcomes. He is a little long-winded when writing of some events within the book - you want him to get to the point. Many times, however, he provides an excellent view into a fantasy world of magic, and thrilling events that keep you turning the page for more. I stayed up late nights until I had completed the book!"
2,Stayed up until 4--what a fool I was!,"The first several hundred pages of this novel areinteresting--the world-building works pretty well, mostcharacters are full, story keeps moving, etc.However, the underlying ideology leaves much to be desired--falls off into horrible sappiness, the magic is not thought-through, the wizard character is hollow and overlyderivative, the violence is largely gruesome and unmotivated,sexist roles for both women and men can wear on your nerves.Showed some promise, but left me so annoyed with myself forfinishing it that I wanted to throw it across the room (Ihoped until the end it would improve)."
1,I just don't get it...,"I am a Fantasy/Sci-Fi junkie. I've devoured Tolkien, Lewis, Brust, Carey, Forsythe, Pratchett, Anderson, etc with relish.This is, frankly, some of the worst writing I've ever seen. I don't understand how it is so popular. The characters are flat and inconsistent. Instead of growing, they alternate between ignorant innocents to boggling knowledge, back and forth. Likewise, the relationships between them.The writing is disjointed and jerky. The conversations are strange, as if they were 13-year-olds with ADD. They spout off key plot points without provocation, because the author apparently couldn't figure out a reasonable way to LEAD into it. Don't waste your time. I'm halfway through the first book, and that's as far as I'm going."
3,Mediocre fantasy fiction...,"I did not think much of this book in comparison to the other two sagas of the day (Wheel of Time and Song of Ice and Fire).Goodkind's writing is not as fluid as either Jordan or Martin, nor is his story as inventive. ""Wizard's First Rule"" is interesting and fairly enjoyable, but it is simply not up to the standard of most fantasy fiction. If anything, it seems a little drawn out and a tad juvenile in writing.Somewhat reccommended, particularly to the mid-teenagers."
5,WOWEEE!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have three of these books and MAN DO I LOVE THEM!!!! Richard is just a woods guide then suddenly he meets a lovely woman, I think, and is in a totaly cool mission to save the world!! I strongly say GET THIS BOOK!!"
5,The ultimate fantasy book!!!,"I am only 13, and have not had the experience of reading as many books as most of the people who commented, but this is most certainly the best book I have ever read. Just as Mr. Goodkind stated in the acknowledgements, Kahlan and Richard's tears and triumphs have touched my heart. I will never be the same again. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in the series. I agree totally with all those who rated this book a 10, and to all those boring, un-imaginative people who rated it below 6, well, if you hated it so much, why did you bother to finish it??? I have read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, and although they were very good, I believe this is better. It is much eaiser to read, and doesn't have all the drawn out details and explainations in it. I couldn't put it down, and had it finished in three days. Well done, Mr. Goodkind"
5,Wonderfull*****,"One of the best Fantasy books I have ever read.Every time I needed to put the book down to go to sleep I just couldnt do it. Dont miss your chance,Read it and the reast of them. there all wonderfull. Just cant get enough of Terry Goodkind."
5,This one kept me interested from the first sentence!,"Eddings, Jordan... move over. There was never a dull moment. We were constantly urged to find out how, or who, or when. There was often something unexpected around the corner as Goodkind placed us IN Richards situation. I don't think I've ever been able to empathize with any fantasy characters as I did with these. I must find out what is next!! Bravo, Goodkind!"
2,nope,"The first 40 chapters were great, so I bought the whole 9 book set... too bad the writer has a morbid fascination/imagination in chapters 40 plus... I would not recommend this book to anyone.. sorry"
3,Typos in the Kindle Version were awful!,"There were so many typos in the Kindle version of this book that it was distracting. If you like the series, and want to read this, maybe the printed version is better."
1,"Blah, boring reading","Why do so many readers like this book? I cannot figure it out. The writing is stilted and wooden. I am only through the first chapter and I cannot stand it. The author may have a great story to tell, but there is no enjoyment in the telling. I was a few days too late to get my $2.99 back and I'm peeved."
3,Iffy Beginning,"The book has a so-so plot, and didn't really draw me into it. Its a bit hard to follow, and can be a bit boring. However, it did have a nice smooth movement from area to area in the book. Only if you like fantasy books should you read this"
1,I was expecting a lot more,"I really enjoy fantasy books, and since I learned to read I usually had one near at hand. For some reason I missed this series over the years. Perhaps it's worse now that I'm some what older, but I don't think this book would have held up when I was 12. The characters are flat, the world has very little texture. The narrative all but disappears as the author tries to cram some sort of moral into his story.I knew this was a famous series, and had high hopes of it being enjoyable when I bought it. I almost bought the second book just to see if it could be as bad as the first, but fortunately I refrained. I've probably read worse fantasy books, but not by much."
1,"If you must read this, try borrowing it first...","I borrowed this from a friend and had to put it down after struggling through about 300 pages. I believe this book is badly written, but I can see how it could appeal to the young adult male readers who like the Jordan'esk type epic stuff.I must say that I'm very glad I borrowed this rather than buying it. If you really feel that you *must* give this book a go, then borrow it from a friend or library to see if it's your cup of tea.If you want something that's a little more mature and well written, have a look at George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. It also has its share of violence and sex, but it's in context, and the story is wonderfully written."
2,A blatant Wheel of Time ripoff,"Im not a huge Robert Jordan fan. Im actually a huge George R R Martin fan waiting for his next book, and Im looking for something decent to read. I read the first four books in this series (out of boredom mainly) and every idea in these books is ripped straight from the Wheel of Time. In most cases Goodkind didn't even bother trying to hide the fact. I could write a 1000 page book myself discussing all the derivations, but I'll just leave a few examples instead: The Children of the Light in WoT = The Blood of the Fold in SoT. Angreal = agiel. Rand al'Thor = Richard Rahl. Aes Sedai = Confessors + Sisters of the Light. Black Ajah = Sisters of the Dark. Sul'dam = Mord-Sith. Seekers of Truth = Seeker of Truth. Naming the Dark One = Naming the Keeper. The Stone of Tear = the Stone of Tears.You get the idea. If you're thinking of reading this book, read Wheel of Time instead, or better yet, A Song of Ice and Fire by George R R Martin."
1,Seriously?,"I've read fantasy books that make use of several fantasy cliches and still manage to be great. This is the mark of a great author; the ability to take something the reader may have seen several times before and make it interesting and exciting again.Goodkind takes just about every fantasy cliche, throws in his objectivist rants, and calls it a novel. Not a fantasy novel, that would be beneath him.Give me a break, Terry. The only thing original about this series is its complete lack of believable characters and dialogue.Don't waste your time."
2,Much More Violent Details Than TV series,"I really liked the television series but the book was much more violent. Sure the bad guys are bad but there are detailed descriptions of horrible torture etc that didn't appear in the book. As far as the writing, it is well written and so detailed that you can picture everything. I mean everything! Thanks."
3,Light reading. Mediocre.,"Original, it's not. Is there any popular fantasy story this guy HASN'T borrowed from? It's a fun read, kinda like a long John Grisham book: those pages keep turning, but there's no depth. NONE. I'm not a reader of highbrow literature, but I like a story to have interesting characterization, something resembling an original plot, etc. WIZARD'S FIRST RULE is an exercise in mediocrity. If you've read much fantasy, there won't be much of anything new to find here. (Also, the prose itself is nothing special; it seems stilted, even childish.) It's good if you want to pass the time on a quiet summer afternoon or three, but don't expect anything special."
2,This book was mediocre at best,"I will not waste my time by delving into the inadequecies of this book compared to other current fantasy authors (ie. Fiest, Hawke, Weis). But, I simply must let it be known to the world of literature that, in my opinion, this book is mediocre at best. Stereotypical characters, constantly under or over developed details, little backstory, and pathetically written emotions were all common in this novel. About the only thing I believe Goodkind was sucessful with in this novel was the sense of fear instilled by the forces of evil into the reader's mind, but, this alone did not save the book from falling below par in the field of today's fantasy writings."
5,Best Book Ever,"Terry Brooks is an amazing new author with a lot of talent. I picked up this book and could not put it down until I was finished. An engaging tale with action, suspense and yes even a little romance this book has anything you could want. I highly recommend anyone who loves fantasy read this book, and while your at it you may just want to pick up the whole series because if it is possible to improve on perfection the rest of the books in this series try to."
5,Instant Classic,Had to at least leave a review for one of the best stories I ever read. Hopefully the series can be invigorated.
2,"Poor writing and characters, but worth a look.","Despite being praised as phenomenal on the cover by Piers Anthony, the writing is technically some of the worst I've ever seen published in fiction, certainly worse than Anthony's. The story is written more like a report of the actions of characters who have little or no deapth rather than a tale of the adventures of people with aspirations, desires, and challenges to face. A strange aspect of the book I've never encountered before is that the characters behave in illogical, two-dimensional, affected ways that reduce the story's reality and deapth. The majic and monsters are relatively creative. It's worth a look because there is an undefinable quality to the story-telling that induced me to read on despite the constantly annoying flaws."
3,"Sex pervert , Fantasy writer Wannabe in an ok novel","Wizard's first rule is the first in a bloody, vicious fantasy series. Although the writer's style is clear and very readable, it's sad to notice that the plot is standard, the characters flat and the only ""interesting"" thing is the unbelievable amount of violence. Personal request for Terry Goodkind: Please ! if I'll see one more fantasy book with a man and woman meeting and feeling that their destinies are tied, I'm going to blind myself."
5,If you like a good story...,"you will probably like this book, i never read a fantasy series or even a single book for that matter and a friend told me to read this one, after i read it i immediately read the rest of the sword of truth series. i have read the whole series 3 times now, and i would go out on a limb to say that it is the best series i have read. the characters come to life and the story keeps you from putting the book down, i think everyone should give this book a shot."
2,Overrated,"Why do all the books reviewed here get four to five stars? I really don't understand it. Certainly, I don't think it's deserved here. I suffered through this book because my husband said that the second book was much better. I will probably never get to it. I think Mr. Goodkind has a few interesting ideas, but I found his characters to be too annoying to live. Ah, the self-sacrificing Kahlan. What a saint. And Richard, our pure-as-the-driven-snow hero. Ugh. I just didn't care at all about them (except to wish them a violent end...hopefully within two chapters). Secondly, the dialogue was the most boring, stilted dreck. To make it even worse, I had just finished reading George R.R. Martin's, Guy Gavriel Kay's, and Vernor Vinge's latest. Now there's characterization and dialogue."
1,Bletch.,"Does the word ""Ishtar"" ring any bells? How about the sequel to the film-version of Highlander?Enough said."
1,Awful.,"This is one of the worst novels I've ever had the misfortune to run across. Bad characterization, bad plotting, bad writing technique, bad grammar -- and derivative/ plagaristic, too! Mr. Goodkind sets a new standard of abject awfulness that very few adult writers could hope to equal.Suggest that the author seek a new day job -- perhaps welding? Or migrant farm labor?"
1,Originality!!??,This is the most strikingly UN-original fantasy I haveever read. Why would anyone waste their time readingdrivel like this???
5,"Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, Book 1)","bought this as a gift. person receiving it was very pleased with the quality of the book. I was a little nervous because there were no pictures of the book online, but was also very pleased."
4,Another Grand Fantasy Epic,"This book is a great beginning to another massive fantasy epic. Though considerably more sexualized than many of the genre, it is nonetheless quite well-crafted. Unlike many of its cohorts, this book doesn't leave you wondering what has happened to major characters that seem to drift out of the author's attention. Most importantly, it leaves you wanting to read the next book, but has enough of a conclusion that you can stop reading after just one book, rather than go through the whole series if you are so inclined."
2,weak weak weak,"A note I sent to a friend:I forgot to tell you how mad I became as I got into the new book that I am reading. You wouldn't believe how much Goodkind has ""borrowed"" from Jordan. I actually got out of bed to check the publishing dates on the books. 70% of Jordan's Wheel of Time series was published up to 4 years before Goodkind's Wizard's 1rst Rule. Anything good in Goodkind's book came from Jordan. You would think that I would be so disgusted that I would boycott Goodkind. Unfortunately, my irritation does not reach that far. It is like finishing up a bowl of BlueBell ice cream, wanting another but having no more BlueBell and so settling for the marshmallow imitation generic grocery brand - empty calories that are not nearly as satisfying. I am so weak..."
4,A Good Start to the Series,"Wizard's First Rule is a good start to the series, but it does take a while to get used to Godkind's style. The story tends to come in spurts, with fast paced action followed by lulls while the characters contemplate matters.The book almost stands alone, but will leave you wanting to get to the next installment in the series."
3,eh...,"Not a bad read, at least it's entertaining. It's a good, fluffy summer book, really. But did anyone else notice that we were being hit over the head with a ""capitalism GOOD, communism/socialism EVIL"" message over and over again? And I agree with other reviewers that the S&M/B&D scenes seemed to go on a little longer and into a little more detail than necessary. Goodkind definitely has both kinks and a message he wants to share. Could've been better, but I've read worse. Enough with the politics, though...."
4,"Wizard's 1st has a blend of humor, and philosophy","The Wizards First Rule by Terry Goodkind, was quite stimulating to the mind. He has refreshing ideas on the subject of philosophy and psychology with a twist of humor and fantasy.He gave the reader something to think about. He has shown in his book, that we should think things over.I'm glad to state, that it is good start of the saga.Knight@Am-N"
2,Underwhelming,"Someone mentioned this work in the same breath as Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time Series? For shame! This is a pithy novel, without a breath of originality in what is otherwise a stagnant and boring book. If one enjoys simplistic wording, and sporadically developed characters, be my guest. I found that rather than introducing personality traits and useful skills graduallly, they are sprung upon the unsuspecting reader. It is as if the author did not tkae the time to plan the book ahead of time and had to rush to include crucial detail. While it was not the worst book that I have read, it was no better than a below average and uninteresting read. Your time would be better spent elsewhere"
1,Wizards First Rule = Fantasy flop!!!,"Wizards First Rule (Book 1 of Terry Goodkinds 'Sword of Truth' series) is a classic example of yet another redundant fantasy ""epic"". One-dimensional and uninspired characters populate an unimaginative and cliched fantasy setting, and on top of it all Goodkind writes with the stylistic flair of a 3rd grader. Seriously, the writing is ridiciously poor. I am a HUGE fantasy and sci-fi fan, and after hearing rave reviews I picked this novel up. Somehow I managed to slog my way through the entire book, which incidentally is about 500 pages too long, and as far as I can tell it has very little positive elements at all. Prepubescent teens looking for gratuitous violence, and cliched characters will be extremely pleased with this book. Other readers looking for something more imaginative, entertaining, and intellectual than this piece of literary [junk], would do well to check out George R.R Martin's ""A Game of Thrones"", or anything by Guy Gavriel Kay."
1,These books are close to horrendous,"I read the first three books of this series about 2 years ago and seriously regret the wasted time. The writing is low quality for the most part but totally breaks down in some sections making you cringe as you read it. The plot is predictable ie. hero always miracously escapes all danger, you know from the first chapter how everything is going to end. Really, these books have some major flaws. Please do yourself a favor and read these instead: George R.R. Martin's a Song of Fire and Ice series, Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series, or Stephen King's the Dark Tower series (which is unbelievably incredible). Or take a break from fantasy and check out some Charles Bukowski, Hunter S. Thompson, or Brett Easton Ellis. I really hate to give something only one star but in this case it was well deserved."
1,"More interesting than blank newsprint, but not by much.","The reviews on the back sounded good, the cover was all right (puffy letters, et al.) and it was nice and thick. Unfortunately it's trite, predictable, and full of kindergarten morality. The characters are transparently borrowed from any other pulp fantasy: the protagonist is a boy-king-sorceror with a MAGIC SWORD (gasp). Two words: ""Luke, I am your father"". Everyone portrayed in the novel seems to be incredibly stupid (""We must ban fire!"" ""Duh, good idea, George!""), and the sensual parts of the book were so corny I started laughing. Normally I try to review only the books I feel are worth buying, but this one was so hyped up by reviews, I feel a warning is order. Stay clear of Goodkind -- stale, uninteresting and some episodes of horrible writing. He gives fantasy a worse name than it already has (thank Anthony and Eddings for that)"
2,Confessor,"I confess that I found that Wizard's First Rule was not only a boring read, but it also droned on a bit.The love story was predictable, and use of magic seemed to be conveniently placed. Even brief flashes of S&M; did not brighten the monotonous read.I don't think I'll continue reading the other 8 books, and instead will focus on books that are a bit more fun."
3,Please just kill them both now,"I liked the idea behind the story rather than the actual story. It doesn't end! It's a hurt/comfort nightmare. I don't mind waiting for characters to get together, but seriously now guy, can I get something here? All there is in this series is angst, with nothing ever ending it.The first book was interesting, but in the end I'd rather he just have them run happily into the sunset than have to read the rest of the series."
2,"Nice Read, but...","This book reads well enough. I must echo the sentiments of those who have said that this is an ""action only"" book. If you like Ian Flemming and the like, you're liable to enjoy this as a foray into fantasy literature. If you find Robert Jordan's painfully slow plot and delightfully descriptive narratives, then you'll probably want to give this book (and series) a miss.The biggest problem I have with this book (and the two subsequent books, which I did indeed read) is the deviant sexual aspect. I'm not a fan of erotic fantasy, and it seems as if Goodkind is trying to gross you out (especially in the sequals). There are tasteful ways of depicting deviant sexuality, we need not the details."
2,An Epic Disappointment,"This book was riddled with grammatical errors as well as extremely obvious plot twist. Even worse was the dialogue. At times it was difficult to discern which character was speaking; much of the dialogue contained cliches. The characters, throughout most of the novel, remian two-dimensional then suddenly change or make unconvincing decisions. At times, Goodkind's characters seem ""inhuman,"" which makes the novel difficult to read. I had to force myself to finish the 800 plus page novel. I was not impressed."
2,"Perversity of the story, destroys any entertaining value","My husband and I were on a trip and we listened with anticipation to the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the story until the part where Richard's torture comes in. What kind of entertainment comes from listening to the degradation and torture of a man by such women? Although pure fantasy, what is the author's message?...what are you left with after listening to this kind of brutality? Training?...no author....just plain garbage....my vote is for the fire....sorry fellow readers...I absolutely love the story.....but not the perversity."
1,Could Of Done Better,"This book had one of the best settings and characters I have ever read about. But this guy completly blew it. Giving everyone powers and sometimes they had them and sometimes they did not. All of that mumbo jumbo about prophecies. Names like Darken Rahl gimme a break. Then you find out Richard is Darken Rahl's son, sounds like Star Wars with Luke and Vader."
1,Ugh,"This is a very, very trite and boring book. Goodkindobviously thinks he knows something about life, and whenhe tries to teach his readers, he ends up sounding preachy and dull. ""People are stupid""...well, duh! I learned that in 1st grade!"
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"This book has restored my faith in the Fantasy Genre. After coming off a bout of bad books, it was refreshing to pick this one up and I could not put it down for anything.Epic is the word to describe this book, though for lack of a better one. This book is more than epic, it is EPIC... if I could increase the font size to reiterate my point I would.Beautifully written with stunning imagery. The main character, Richard, is very easy to identify with. He is not perfect, and he knows it, and it makes him that much more believeable. The book also brings in a bit of humor into such a dark fantasy novel with the character of Zedd.EXCELLENT READ! Once you read this you will want to run out and buy the rest of the series. I know, because that is exactly what I did."
5,Smart Fantasy,"This series began an obsession for smart, exciting fantasy books. I've yet to find anything quite like Wizard's First Rule. It's an amazing book."
5,People Are Stupid!,"Terry Goodkind is a gifted author who has a unique and fascinating way of making his characters come to life. I've read this book 5 times now (out loud and to myself) and every time I do, I fall in love with the people, the place, the imagery... over and over again. The beginning of a breathtaking, life-changing series, Wizard's First Rule has a special place on my bookshelf. Even if sci-fi/fantasy isn't your favorite, I believe you will still enjoy this novel because it is most simply just a great story. Highly, highly recommended!"
4,Good Read,"I read alot. I have read alot of books and i can honestly say that if you are into fantasy this series is a good one. The first book of the series is a great read and it held my attention the entire book (some thing hard to do). I like Goodkinds writing style and the style of the book is very well written. This book isnt a very hard read but it is deff well worth it. The story is very easy to get into and terry does a good job of telling that story. The main focus of the book is to biuld characters and give them personality. The good people in the book are very good and the bad people are very bad. Its very easy to sympathise with the ""good"" characters in this novel. I am on the 6th of the series and i have yet to get bored yet. You will enjoy this book, trust me"
1,Poor writing,"I read this after being recommended by a friend. What a mistake. The writing was stilted, filled with cliches and irritating. Characters show up, then disappear or die, like the man turned into a wolf. What did he add to the story? The names alone are bad enough, Darken Ruhl as the villain, D. Cipher as the main character. The fact that so many people like this badly written, overly long, anticlimatic book is very disappointing. I understand that the ideas in the book might seem a bit original, but the way the story is told, coupled with the terrible writing, made this book very difficult to enjoy in the least. I finished it out of a sheer need to get to the end. This is one of the worst books I've ever read."
2,"Its ok, could have been great.........","The world is detailed and has lots of original ideas. I liked the little twists, it makes the reading even better.This novel had awkward pacing though. Like, sometimes it can be a page turner, then the next moment, your reading about 80 pages about some dang tribals, no action, no plot development, just 80 pages on tribals, yee hah. One of the more boring scenes is a series of torture sequences that lasted for like 100 pages. I mean, it was really offensive at first, then it just got tedious. Can we just get on with the novel and kill the freakin mistriss.The characters are flat also, but i dont need to go in detail about that ... .But when the plot did move along or the action did start going, it was like readin a fantasy classic, untill, of course, we take a 50 page break campin in the woods lecturin about prophecies. ZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!"
