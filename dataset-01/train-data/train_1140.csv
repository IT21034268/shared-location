3,Aluminum,"Slllick. Digital slick. Pro tools slick. There is a photo in this album's booklet of the artist herself sitting lost and bewildered on the studio floor while behind her, handlers put what looks like a 60-piece orchestra through their paces. That about sums it up. There's a breathy little girl singer in here, who can occasionally summon some power and tinkle on the piano on some catchy numbers. Then, the expensive producers take it and make it very digital and very slick while the hollywood strings punctuate right along. Good product? You bet. Great music? Um, well... it's so slick it might slip out of my memory like butter. Soon to be dated? Yes, and then I fear it will be hilarious. But it's fun for now. And hey, at least it isn't obscene filth like much of this kind of thing is these days."
1,Get this girl some singing lessons!,"Good pianist and decent songwriter, but her singing is horrible! I know not everyone out there can sing, but she has one of the WORST voices I've ever heard! She's like that Justin Timberlake bloke, only she can actually play an instrument and doesn't dance around like a fool.I recon she'll be a one-hit-wonder!"
2,better off playing piano,"Vanessa is so overrated! She's an excellenct piano player(much better than Alicia Keys) but her voice is just as bad as britney's. It's nasly, whiny and squeaky. A thousand miles is the only catchy song, everything else is medicore and downright annoying because her voice spoils the song."
1,Poppy nonsense,"Yes, we've established the fact that Ms. Carlton can indeed play the piano (I enjoyed the music and lyrics in ""Wanted) but we must come upon the shockingly straight truth of realization that SHE CANNOT SING! I've heard her live as well, and it is far from flattering to the ears!"
2,Big disappointment,"I bought this CD with some money I got for Christmas from my grandma... well, let's just say I was more than a little disappointed when I brought it home... I absolutely LOVE the singles on the radio, but it pretty much stops there. I have to admit that the first time I really listened to this CD, it literally scared me. I thought she was some sort of psycho. The non-radio songs are VERY, VERY different from the ones on the radio--beware."
3,Think what you want...,"... but please, please, PLEASE do not compare this girl to Tori Amos! And I say it again! PLEASE!!!! She never comes CLOSE to Tori, never ONCE through this entire CD, and to have people drawing comparisions between the two merely because both play piano and sing is like comparing Carlos Santana to Avril fecking Lavigne because both play guitar!That being said, ""Be not Nobody"" is an okay CD. The piano playing is pretty nice actually, and she's got some good melodies here and there, but on the whole it sounded overpolished and overpracticed, except for her voice, which could never have enough practice- it is nasal and irritating at worst and generally unremarkable at best."
3,Give Her A Few Years,"This album is incredibly reminiscent of Paula Cole's ""Harbinger"". For those of you who don't know that album, let me explain.I think Ms. Carlton has a tremendous amount of raw talent. I think her piano skills are quite admirable, and her voice is pleasant and unique.Unfortunately, however, her young age is obvious. Her lyrics are over-wrought and full of tender emotions, rather than offering an introspective or thoughtful look at the events that caused those emotions. Instead of a mature dive into her mind, she seems to blurt the lyrics as they come into her head, teenage angst and all.I imagine great things will come of this woman. They say hindsight is 20-20... Perhaps for Ms. Carlton it will be all she needs."
2,Disappointed,I am disappointed with this cd. A Thousand Miles is the best song. Her voice grows irritating after a few listens. I have read comparisons to Fiona Apple and Tori Amos... sorry but Fiona and Tori have more lyrical and musical depth than Vanessa. Just because they all play piano doesn't mean they should be compared. I give her credit for writing her own songs and playing the piano but the songs aren't that catchy to warrant continued listens.
5,i give her credit!,"I like how the songs aren't annoyingly repeticious. some people said they are, but they aren't, the songs change tunes and have different sounds and instraments, which makes it more complex. I can't stand songs that repeat annoyingly like alot of songs on the radio, shes not like that, thats why i can listen to her. I like how her songs have feeling, its sad that so many artists dont even have feeling in their music cause the songs are just songs that mean nothing to them. i give vanessa carlton credit for doing what she wants, and for her music being complex and i like how it has feeling.I would also like to recommend Jane Child, she is the most amazing singer. you can hear her music at www.janechild.com she writes her own songs and plays her own instrements."
4,"Amazing vocals, great arrangements, and great songs","This is an excellent albums with a lot of diversity, great production, and just good songs. This is like a less eclectic Tori Amos at her best."
5,Fresh and Original.,"Hopefully the Grammys will remember Vanessa Carlton next year when they pick the nominess for Best New Artist. So far out of all the new artists to arrive this year, no one has the originality and freshness that Vanessa Carlton has. Whats most impressive is that she wrote and arranged 10 out of 11 tracks. Highlights of the album include the brilliant A Thousand Miles, with Vanessas charming vocals and sweet lyircs this should as well be nominated for a Grammy. Equally impressive is the opening track Ordinary Day and the funky Prince. A lot of credit goes to this young lady for making her own music and trying something new. Its a welcome change to some of the songs that have been filling the airwaves lately. I highly recommend this album and guarantee you won't be disappointed."
3,Be Not Nobody,"My husband & I saw her live when she opened for the GooGoo Dolls and were impressed with her music, especially ""Thousand Miles"". Unfortunately, I was not overly impressed with this cd. There are 3-4 songs I think are really good, but the rest is just so-so.... However, there is a great Rolling Stones remake on this album..."
2,One of the most boring albums ever!,"Great album? Please! I bought this album because I love Thousand Miles and is there any other good songs? No. She's a good pianist, but she cannot sing! She should just go for composing, she'll be good at that but not a singer! People who have trouble sleeping would find this album very helpful - it would send you off to sleep!"
4,vanessa: open letter to pretty baby,"Ms. Carlton...pretty baby...This song has a pop feel, but at closer listen it has layers, layers which many manufactured songs do not have. It is a credit to your blossoming talent that you can write a song which seems like a candy cane ballad...yet on a deeper listen one realizes you have been influenced much more by the ghosts of Mozart and Beethoven than the manufactured idea of someone who thinks that a song will be a big hit. Vanessa, whether you know it or not this song is chilling and gripping. In a fascinating and maybe ingenious way it sounds like you wrote this song for yourself...pretty baby... pop?...yet subtlely genius...keep your fingers to the piano...brilliance..."
1,be nobody... exactly,"Be nobody, exactly what she is. A nobody, seeing as she can't sing at all, the piano playing is crap. The song ""a thousand miles"" is so annoying, and when this song was out, I would hear it everywhere I went. I kid you not, I just couldn't stand hearing it, I felt like I was gonna die or pass out in the store that they were playing the song. Yes, it was just that awful! Once again, I kid you not. so if you're thinking of buying this CD, don't! please don't waste your money on this garbage. i'm sure glad i didn't! :)"
2,This is not a very good CD!!!,"When I first got this CD, I listened to all the songs on it, and when I finished listening, the only songs I practically liked were ""A Thousand Miles"", ""Ordinary Day"", and ""Pretty Baby"". She has a bad, childish, shallow voice, and in some songs she sounds like Britney Spears. If you want a great CD to listen to, get Avril Lavigne's newest album, ""Let Go"" or Michelle Branch's newest CD. Anything but this!!!"
2,Disappointing . . .,"When I first heard the song ""A Thousand Miles"" on the radio, I loved it. I listened attentively every time it came on, and finally decided to purchase her album. It was a letdown. None of the songs match up to ""A Thousand Mile""'s standard. Sure, there are some songs worth listening to: ""Ordinary Day"" ""Rinse"" ""Paint it Black"" and ""Pretty Baby"" aren't bad. In fact, I quite like ""Ordinary Day"". But none of the songs are like the one I originally heard. I'm not telling you not to buy this, because I don't know what you like in music, but I'd recommend listening to it first--don't just pick it up and buy it. I wasted thirteen dollars, IMO."
3,An Ordinary Album,"Personally I think this CD is OK. It's not a superb album, but not a bad one either. I'd listened to the CD and found that I only loved 3 or 4 songs on it. As for the rest of the tracks, they are just ok. I wouldn't say that they sound awful, they just couldn't get me to listen to over and over like ""A Thousand Miles"" and ""An ordinary day"" could. I agree with some reviews that said Venessa Carlton doesn't have a great voice. No, she doesn't, but her brilliant piano skill did make her debut album sound better then average. If you don't like loud music, then I assume you might like this CD."
4,Great first album!,"I bought this CD based solely on hearing Vanessa Carlton's first single, ""A Thousand Miles,"" hoping for more of the same. Upon the first listen-through, I was somewhat disappointed, as only one song sounded like ""A Thousand Miles."" Thankfully, I gave the CD a few more chances and soon found that her other songs, however different, were just as good or better.Vanessa graces nearly all of the songs with her amazing piano skill and proves herself as a talented songwriter on ten of the eleven songs (she does a cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Paint It Black""). I found her words to be very powerful, particularly on ""Ordinary Day,"" ""Wanted,"" and ""Twilight"" and was grateful that the lyrics were included with the CD.Stand-out Tracks: ""Ordinary Day,"" ""A Thousand Miles,"" ""Sway,"" ""Wanted,"" and ""Twilight""Bottom Line: A rewarding CD, especially on repeated listenings."
3,Unique; shows potential. (3.5 stars),"Vanessa Carlton seems to have talent--which is rare in the mainstream music scene these days. After releasing the single ""A Thousand Miles"" (a great song), she's become a household name. She has wonderful musical ability; she has a sweet yet strong singing voice and can play the piano.However, although I really like ""Ordinary Day"", ""Paradise"", the aforementioned ""A Thousand Miles"", and her remake of ""Paint It Black"", most of her songs sound the same. It's very hard to tell which song is which for the first few seconds of one of her songs. I see a lot of potential here, and I think that she can use that potential to create more songs that sound different from each other."
4,Nice Debut,"I enjoyed this cd...""A Thousand Miles"" is absoutely one of my favorite songs. Vanessa's piano playing talent is evident, but her vocals are a bit lacking. Neverthelesss, ""Be Not Nobody"" is a refreshing cd!"
5,Great Talent,"It is nice to see a fun, light hearted, piano player in the mix of guitar playing bad girls. Carlton blends beautiful orchestration with adictive piano chords and the results are beauiful songs such as ""A Thousand Miles"" and the absolutly stunning ""Twilight."" Personally ""Ordinary Day"" is my favorive, but that's because one can't help but smile at its cuteness. I really hope that she is not lost in the mob of chick-rockers."
5,absolute talent,"Any one of the songs in this album could have hit number one, not just A Thousand Miles.Vanessa is a mesmerizing talent at 21. She has a unique voice, and is a superb pianist. A fine orchestra just adds to the album without overwhelming her performance.You go girl!"
5,Excellent CD - great tunes!,"""Be Not Nobody"" is one of the best CD's I've ever heard. Vanessa has a wonderful voice and is a skillful pianist, and uses them both to incorporate pop, rock, and blues into many great hit songs on this CD. If you liked her first hit single, A Thousand Miles, then you'll LOVE this CD. It has many great songs, such as Ordinary Day, Rinse, and Twilight just to name a few. This CD is going to be an instant hit and Vanessa is going to have a great career as a singer/piano player, and I would HIGHLY recommend that you get this CD, or at least listen to A Thousand Miles! Vanessa's songs are a lot like Michelle Branch, so if you like her, you'll LOVE Vanessa!"
3,"Good, but a bit annoying.","I think this CD is an extremely good work! I love all of the songs, especially her infamous 1000 Miles. However, I do have to turn it off halfway through.. She is just way too whiny sometimes. Her voice makes me a bit nervous."
2,Need to balance the scale,"Ok, this cd is decent for pop music, but doesn't deserve the excessive praise some people are giving it. Vanessa Carlton does not compare to Tori Amos or Fiona Apple by any standard. This music is catchy and enjoyable, but void of any true passion, genius, or innovation."
4,Talented,"Singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton hit the Top 40 mainstream charts with her sophisticated ""A Thousand Miles"" and became one of the It-artists of the early 2000s. Her debut album Be Not Nobody may not contain anything nearly as listenable as that instant first single, but a couple songs come pretty close, especially ""Ordinary Day"" and ""Pretty Baby."" Carlton has a sweet, girlish singing style that isn't impressive but doesn't grate over a record as much as, say, Britney Spears can, but the orchestra-driven CD carries her somewhat bland delivery to new heights. The sophisticated pop/rock album is full of songs that are truly performed in an incredible fashion, despite if one of handful are radio-friendly. Still, it's a great try."
4,A Gloomy... yet soulful C.D,This C.D is a C.D that is okay if you don't get. The songs are very slow but Vanessa sings very well.1.Ordinary Day- The best song on C.D 10/102.Unsung- Has a great popish/rockish tune 10/103.A Thousand Miles- Very good 1st single 10/104.Pretty Baby- A slow song with a good tune 10/105.Rinse-Very soft and not upbeat 8/106.Sway- A song with good rhythem 9/107.Paradise- TOO SLOW!!!!!!! 4/108.Prince-A cool happy song 9/109.Paint it black-This song is very rockish. 10/1010.Wanted- Good rhythem 8/1011.Twilight-Again... TOO SLOW!!! 4/10
2,Not What Its Hyped Up To Be,"I bought this CD cause I read many reviews that spoke highly of it. Honestly, this CD isn't all its cracked up to be. If you really want a really good CD, go get Michelle Branch's SPIRIT ROOM and Norah Jones ""Come Away With Me"". Those two are quality CD's"
4,"On ""Be Not Nobody"", Vanessa proves she is SOMEBODY!","Being that Vanessa is being compared to a young Tori Amos, my interest was definitely peaked! However, NOONE can be Tori!!! She is a class act but Vanessa definitely does evoke some of Tori's classic style. Vanessa can write her music, play the piano, evoke many emotions, etc....the standout track on her debut is the rocking UNSUNG with almost torch song like style vocals....her ballads WANTED and PRETTY BABY are also very beautiful....and her haunting TWILIGHT caps off an almost flawless debut....here's hoping she is around for a long while!!!"
2,Worst singer,I can't stand the way she sings but she has good writing ability and can play the piano well. How she got to be a singer i don't know.
1,Shove it back in the horse! (Part II),"Here's the story:You get some training as a ballerina, except you can't cut the mustard, and any hope that you had for a show biz career in ballet dies. You parents know somebody in the music business. They get you an interview and pull some strings. You get some training on piano and write some very rudimentary songs about female angst. Somebody at some record company thinks it'll sell so they put a lot of money into production and promote the hell out of it. Even the title ""Be not Nobody"" (Which some A&R; guy probably thought up) smacks of teenage naivette.Anyway, the CD sells.A year later, you put out another CD, and it bombs, big time. It seems like some big talent was in all actuality, a blow out.What happened?!!!"
3,good but not that good...,"I don't naturally believe it that many like Be Not Nobody... when I actually listened to it, I find that the song ""A Thousand Miles"" was the only one that has sense. The music is really good with Vanessa's talent in piano and singing but the lyrics are just not like that extraordinary..."
3,goodstuff,"it's a fine first effert, Carlton shows great talent on this CD. Very beautiful and worth buying."
1,a nobody indeed,"hi, I heard ""a thousand miles"" on the radio one day and after listening to some of it, i hated it! Just horrible music I ever heard! how can anyone actually like this crap? seriously. it's really bad.i didnt even listen to the whole song by Vanessa, cuz after 30 seconds into the song, i turned off the radio and felt like I was about to hurl. I'm not kidding either. sorry to give this young un-talented lady a bad review, but i wouldnt wanna lie and say ""she's great"" when she's not. be a nobody she will forever be and she can practice singing her song 'a thousand' times until she wears her tired voice out."
2,Bad Recording Quality,"This disc has great songs on it, but they are recorded in a very poor manner. You can actually hear the microphone input clip on parts of certain songs. This is solely the fault of the recording engineer. In other parts you begin to wonder if the other instruments are the feature and not Vanessa.If you are listening to this CD on a boombox or some HTIB system, you may not ba able to hear what I hear (I have Classe front end components pushing B&W; 802D speakers.) When I purchase a CD I expect recording quality better than what I can do in my basement!"
1,ear tyranny!,"i agree with the other poster who said that v.c is like michelle branch. However, v.c's voice is all wonky and goes all over the place. you can actually hear where the tapes of her singing were cut and pasted to make it sound like she could carry a tune throughout an entire song. the piano is warmed over tori amos and liberache showmanship. and the lyrics barely approach the depths of Branch's Spirit Room. Mr. Carlton must've called in some favors to get this recorded."
2,Don't waste your money,"If you can, buy the single ""Ordinary Day"" and don't waste your money on the whole cd. A Thousand Miles is alright, but that's been played to death on the radio anyway. The rest of the songs are immature and annoying. What I don't understand is how she could have written ""Ordinary Day"", an exceptional song, and also have been the author of all this other crap. The other songs seriously sound like she was under a deadline to just write something ... anything ... to fill the cd. They're unimaginative, repetetive, and whiny. Pretty Baby is so irritating, I find it about as pleasant as nails on a chalk board."
2,A rip off...,"Her style is a rip off of Michelle Brnach's, or at least A Thousand Miles is. If you want the ture style of what she tried to do, listen to Michelle Branch!"
1,corny movie soundtrack,"this album BLOWS! the current single ""ordaniry day"" is one of those songs you'll hear in a movie as they go through a park! the songs make me wanna VOMIT! it's so lame and corny!so what if she can play piano? that doesn't make her songs good!she has the most annoying voice next to that high school drop out from canada(avril lavigne)these songs get REALLY OLD FAST!I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE THAT COULD LISTEN TO THIS MORE THAN ONCE AND STILL STAY SANE!SKIP THIS ALBUM!"
5,This girl has talent.,"I first heard this gal on the radio. Fell in love with her voice on the CD. My daughter and I are taking piano lessons and Vanessa has inspired us both with her beautiful piano notes on this CD. While she does have some kinks to work out (give her a break it is her 1st CD!), I think this is another one of those CDs all music lovers must have. Aren't you tired of all those teeny boppers who can't really sing very well, can't play any instruments, can't write songs, etc? All they do is sing with PLENTY of background vocals & dance. This girl has all-around talent. And while the critic(s) blasted her for ""Paint it Black""; I kind of liked it. It was different. Sometimes different is good."
4,"""In the palm of your hand...""","Be Not Nobody is the debut album from Vanessa Carlton. It is not her best as Harmonium and Heroes and Thieves but nonetheless, Vanessa's voice and songwriting showed amazing potential back then. Some of the songs are gorgeous like Ordinary Day, Sway, Twilight, Wanted, Paradise, and of course A Thousand Miles. Some songs don't stick like the previous ones I mentioned but I think Carlton was just finding her voice in 2002 and she more than made up for it with her last two LPs. There are some stunning moments on Be Not Nobody but you want real magic then check out her later works instead. Good luck!"
4,4 1/2 stars. This album is great!,"I had had Vanessa's Carlton Be not nobody for a little more than a year , and at first I really didn't care for it . It was too classical for me. Then I started forcing myself to listen to it and found it to be pretty good! I love all the songs on here. And Vanessa has such a powerful voice, you can't help but fall in love with this cd. Anyways the best songs on here are :Ordinary Day, Unsung,Thousand Miles, Pretty Baby, Rinse ,Prince, Wanted , Twlight and then my #1 fave is Paint it black. I know she is not the orginal singer of that song , but she has outstanding vocals on Paint it black.Really good cd. You need it I am telling You."
4,Vanessa Makes Her Debut,"It was in 2002, when piano player and singer Vanessa Carlton had her music fall upon the public's ears. Carlton's music and sound is that of Pop/Rock, with a heavy but perfect orcestration. Along with an orchestra, there are professional guitars, bass, and drum players. These performers are what makes Vanessa's sound so interesting. They are truly the backbone to Carlton's music. Vanessa herself has interesting musical traits as well. Her voice is all but unpleasent, and her musical knowledge of how to play her instrument rings throughout the entire album. With this debut release, Vanessa Carlton landed herself several appearances on compilation CDs and as part of the soundtrack to the television show Charmmed. A track to take a good listen to is that of Carlton's version of ""Paint It Black"", its awesome in her style and sound. The record is a well thought and well performed piece of work."
3,"Something Corporate, anyone?","It seems strange, but I keep thinking that Vanessa Carlton should team up with Something Corporate or something. They're nearly identical. Fake string harmonies with leading piano and some high pitched vocals. Not bad, mind you. But they sure do sound similar."
4,Be somebody and buy Be Not Nobody!,"If you want to hear one of pop music's best written songs then Vanessa Carlton's debut Be Not Nobody is the record to purchase. Breakout hit ""A Thousand Miles"" soared to No. 1 on charts because of its unique piano arpeggios and gorgeous melodies. Though her hits (""A Thousand Miles,"" ""Ordinary Day"" and ""Pretty Baby"") are her best on the album, this disc is still pretty impressive. ""A Thousand Miles"" definitely should've won a Grammy for Song of the Year, and not Norah Jones' not-even-self-penned (Carlton wrote ""A Thousand Miles"" by herself, along with the majority of her tunes of her debut) ""Don't Know Why;"" I honestly ""don't know why"" Jones is so big. Though her singing vocals aren't that unique or distinvtive, and Be Not Nobody sports lots of filler, Vanessa Carlton and her record are definitely worth knowing better and purchasing."
3,megh...,"well i gotta say. i bought this c.d for my sis, never even hearing vanessa carlton before (well i heard ordinary day) and ya. my sis told me it was really good. so i borrowed it. it was good. it didn't live up to my expectations, but it was ok. i think the first four songs on it are awesome. greatly written! the rest was ok. kinda boring though. i think it's good for background music. but her voice gets REALLY annoying after a while. whoever thinks shes good at singing isn't very musiccally aware. she sounds good in ""pretty baby"" and a few other songs. she has her good moments, but i personally dont like her voice. if u wanna see talent, check out michelle branch! she has an AWESOME voice, plays guitar, piano, and writes her own muzik. what more could u want?? but ya. i guess if u like chick musik with a twist u'd like this cd."
5,The best new female singer!,"Tell me why Vanessa has no Grammy's yet?? She writes her own songs, arranges her own vocals, and plays the piano. Is that not considered enough talents anymore? Instead people like Avril or Michelle win awards because they play guitars? Uh, okay. Anyways, I love the songs ""Pretty Baby"" (love her voice on this track), ""A Thousand Miles"" (first made me a fan), ""Twilight"" (love the ups and downs of her voice), and ""Rinse"" (the lyrics are pretty good if you listen to them)."
2,Unfortunately Not Pleased,"I have to say that I am not satisfied with this album. I was hoping for a lot of upbeat, catchy tunes like ""A Thousand Miles"" but was let down. I agree that she can play the piano beautifully and has a great voice but the songs just aren't that great. Michelle Branch's album has more great songs on it than this one."
3,Slick production ruins solid songs,"I first heard Vanessa Carlton on a local NY tv program where she was playing her songs alone on piano. I was pretty impressed with the songs and her performance at the time, and I eagerly awaited the release of her debut. But a lot can happen between the writing of a song and the recording process. The emotional intimacy of her solo playing is lost in these over-produced and melodramatic tunes. It's really a shame because I think the girl is talented, but she would have been better served by a less fluffy producer, who seems to have to put his stamp all over every song. Another example of the music biz taking potentially good material and making bad music] out of it."
2,"I thought this CD was going to be good, but I was wrong...","This CD wasn't too good. I thought this CD was going to be really good because I liked the singles and when they came out. ""A Thousand Miles"", ""Ordinary Day"", and ""Pretty Baby"" caught me into this CD. I got it on Christmas day. I thought they were going to sound like the first four, but no, they sound horrible, no offence to Vanessa. Some of them sound like she's half asleep. I really, really do NOT like it when the singles sound so good, and the rest of the CD sounds like a bunch of singing weasels. It's like a trick to make you buy the CD or something, which I bet you that's what it is. I'd rate this CD 4/10.In conclusion, I wouldn't buy this CD. Download some of the music off your comp. first or listen to it off a website, and your ears should tell you. If you want to buy it, go ahead, but I'm not going to make you buy it."
2,Yeah Yeah Yeah!,"One Of the worst albums I've ever listened to. This girl may have some talent but she better start using it. She can play a piano but she surely can't write songs nor sing. this album laks both vocally, lyricly and artisticly. no originality here, no fun, just plain boredom. No risks envolved. This girl is 22 when I saw the video for Thousand Miles I thought she was 13. Just a Commercial bubblegum pop with no soul and no heart put into it. I Know it's her debut so I'll give it 2 stars but other than that she needs to do better material. So maybe next time."
2,"BE NOT NOBODY, IN A FEW THAT WILL BE CORRECT!",Can you say Yuck! Shes so tryin to rip off michelle branch and a.keys. Lyrics are poorly written and i think the piano sucks. No ray charles dear...keep tryin though..thats all i have to say.
2,MICHELLE BRANCH WITH A PIANO,"The way people were ga-ga over this girl,I was expecting that she'd be a more up-tempo Fiona Apple.A pianoist who can make cathy yet durable pop tunes.Not really.I checked out her album ""Be Not Nobody"" and is clear thatshe comes off basically as Michelle Branch with piano.Formulaic ""TRL"" dreck just spruced up with piano playing and psuedo-""I'm an artise!"" marketing.This album's first single ""A Thousand Miles"" is Top 40 junk it just has januty keyboards.WOW!Carlton's debut should teach people that just because somebody plays an intrusment doesn't mean that they are groundbreaking or creative(Alicia Keys or the aforementioned Branch anyone?)Check out Norah Jones' ""Come Away With Me"":A elegant gem that blows this popcorn music out of the water."
5,What a political biography should be,"Benjamin Disraeli was a fascinating figure, and this book by Sarah Bradford does a remarkable job of bringing his Parliamentary exploits to life. While it can sometimes be difficult to make such political wrangling interesting, Bradford does an excellent job of staying both fresh and informative. This book is very well-researched and strikes a solid balance between Disraeli's personal life and his professional career. The reader will really come to know Disraeli the man through his voluminous personal correspondence. I highly recommend this biography."
2,Not very good,"Of course this is my humble opinion, but I thought this book was extremely lacking. I thought the description of the book sounded great and that this would be a real psychological thriller. But the characters weren't well developed at all and the story really lagged. I should have felt something for some of the characters but I just didn't. I didn't feel badly for the victim and I didn't feel any anger for Alex Leonard (the murderer). I felt like I was being dragged through the book rather than involved in the story. And the ending was anti-climatic I think. I saw it coming a mile away and was rather disappointed to discover I was right."
1,Pretty bad,"The synopsis of this book sounded so good, but the book itself was poorly written. There is very little background gone into when the book first begins, it reads as though it is starting from the middle of a story, instead of the beginning. It lacks substance. This is supposed to be the first book in a trilogy series. I hope the other two are better than this first one"
5,Must Read if you are headed to Australia for over 3 weeks,"I came across this book almost by accident and I was surprised by how easy to read and useful it is.The prices and costs may not be up to date but these can be determined by surfing the net. Well worth the price and the effort.Like I said, a must - read for anyone headed to Australia for over 3 weeks.Bear in mind however that this version has not been updated for a few years."
2,Hand made indeed ?,Not worth the money compared to what I could have bought for much less. I ordered 2 and one of them doesn't work. I couldn't return it because I tossed the boxes out before I had a chance to install and test them. My mistake and loss. The shades are cheap and flimsy for the price of the lamp. Extremely Disappointed. Shows me that you don't always get what you pay for.
5,In the tradition . . .,". . . of great post-Beatles pop records like Badfinger's ""Straight Up,"" Todd Rundgren's ""Something/Anything,"" Dwight Twilley's ""Sincerely,"" and, more recently, Ride's ""Carnival of Lights,"" ""See You in the Sunshine"" is an utterly gorgeous and often adventurous record. There are moments when one would swear McCartney or Lennon were at the helm, or that somehow all of the above-mentioned giants had been morphed into one melodically-driven mastermind. Dill's latest might well be the best pop-rock record of the 21st century."
4,It could be better,"It's a good material if you wanna learn new words. But it could be better. For example, it has not images, pics, anything. Just text, text and text. Sometimes it is bored. However, I can recommend it. It's content is just to save meanings in the mind."
3,Oldies but Goodies,"This particular television series was first broadcast in the US during the mid-nineties. British actor, Patrick McNee, narrates diverse true haunting cases, which are backed-up by re-enactors. Good stuff for those who might be new to the phenomenon of ghosts, but just a bit dull for those who enjoy programs such as ""Most Haunted"" or ""Ghost Hunters,"" in which actual investigations are filmed for broadcast."
4,worth seeing first half,I was surprised that this was an old show that was shown on channel 2 when I was a kid. Some of the stories in the first half were very good and freaky scary. worth watching once.
1,Save Your Money,"Lets just put it this way, its not what I expected and couldn't sell it at a yard sale for .50 cents. Not realist enough for me. Save your money, PLEASE."
3,Not happy,"Item had a lot of damage, and probably shoudn't have been resold. Pages were scribbled with pen and book was very worn."
1,"Terrible: Promotes NOT sharing, exclusionary play and revenge","I was shocked to open this. This terrible book promotes NOT sharing, exclusionary play and then REVENGE, not to mention male/female stereotypes. The story goes: two girls having a tea party and won't let their little brother play with them. Then to get back at them, he puts a spider in their tea and their game and book are over. Shame! I would never let my little girl read such a horrible book. The author should be ashamed to teach kids this kind of behavior. This book has absolutely ZERO redeeming qualities. I would give it zero stars instead of 1 if I could figure out how."
1,This isn't a good book,"I bought this book for my daughter to go with her first tea set. I was annoyed the first time I read it to her. This is how the book goes: Ruby & Louise have a tea party, brother Max wants to be included. They say no, and make him be the waiter. He puts gummy spiders in their food.Really? Do people even put thought in kid's books anymore?"
5,Tea party continued,Fun book for the granddaughters. They love reading it and living it our with an actual tea party. Good value
1,Horrible hack stuff,This is the worst of fantasy writing. I wish it had remained in the fantasy world.
1,VERY POOR QUALITY,"This compilation may be the ultimate Gladys Knight & the Pips in the number of songs but the quality of the recording is very poor. This CD has every song you could ever wish for but unless you don't mind your music sounding like your listening to it under water, stay away from this one. Gladys sounded better on AM radio back in the day than on this compilation recording. Do not accept quantity over quality, you will be disappointed."
5,Dig It,"I have been buying Gladys Knight & The Pips Albums,8 Tracks,Cassettes,CDS,And will keep on buying their music as long as they keep on making that sweet music.This Gold CD will fit perfect in my collection.In ending,the old white man has just one thing to add- Baby if you dont dig there sounds ( You Got A Hole In Your Soul) Till next time, Wally S"
5,Gladys Knight Legendary !,Call your self a singer well let me tell you this lady is if not the best they don't make them like her anymore love Gladys Knight !!!
4,"An excellent, breath-taking read!!","Although not of the same era, Elizabeth Bowen's The Death of the Heart brings to mind the work of Jane Austen. This literary masterpiece, written in the Modern Period (during or immediately after World War I), centers around an adolescent girl's ""coming of age"" in an era of many questions and precious few answers. The brilliance of this novel is the linking of the familiar novel format to a Virginia Woolf-like stream of conciousness style of writing. I've recommended this book to many a bibliophile and never have had it fail to make an impact on the reader"
5,The Death of the Heart,Excellent book. It is well written and interesting from beginning to end. I am delighted to discover an autho9r that I didn't know. The book is an insight into British society circa 1930 but isn't overdone. the characters ring true. It's a fine read.
2,"Well-written, but intensely boring","Don't get me wrong: I like Jane Austen and I've been entertained by Henry James. I like Trollope and I've read numerous Russian novels. Why is this book on the 100 best list? It is soooo boring. The characters are static, the mood bleak, and the plot practically non-existent."
2,"Straight Review From a ""Commoner""","Sorry folks but 400 pages of pettiness is a downer. The snobby Brits in this book are about as shallow as the nothing lives they are living. The poor 16 year old girl, Portia, needs a good shrink, hopefully one not on the snobby side. Anna and Thomas, brother and sister-in-law and their friends, have countless conversations, during tea, of meaningless topics, saying meaningless things. WHAT'S THE POINT? The only part of interest for me was near the end, when the girl stood her ground. Of course, no good came from that either. The raving reviewers who 5 starred this book sound a little phoney to me also. But, alas, I'm just a commoner who appreciates a deep book about people with souls and a little personality and charm."
2,huh?,"Portia is an orphaned 16 year old girl sent to live with her half-brother and his wife. They aren't very nice to Portia. She ""falls in love"" with a friend of her brother's wife. He rejects her. It turns out the wife has been reading Portia's diary. Portia throws herself at another friend of the family. He toorejects her. Everyone realizes they've been buzzardly.Whoopty flippin' doo...This is supposed to be a poignant portrait of a young girl coming of age; read To Kill a Mockingbird instead."
2,Bored to the Heart,Truly dull tale of an teenage girl who comes to live with a married older half brother and his wife. The wife is a gad about with lots of men friends who reads Portia's diary. The brother is a bore who can barely communicate with his sister and who doesn't like his wife's friends and is too timid to say anything.The only person in the household who treats Portia as if she has the slightest bit of interest is Matchett the long time family servant. All the same the male vistors to the house are all captivated by Portia especially Eddie a friend of Anna's with a severe chip on his shoulder. Portia finally has enough of the betrayal's and revolts and runs away.The reader hopes that Portia will never return.
3,Great Fleece but Pricey,"I ordered this for a Christmas gift and paid about $55 plus tax and shipping. When it arrived, it was nice but it didn't quite seem worth $55. I think it definitely would have been worth $35-$40. It's a quality fleece but not worth $55."
2,Ehhh...,"Ehhh...I bought this album on a whim. I was in Best Buy and saw this really hot guy holding a guitar and thought ""Why not?"" Well, I got home and wasn't knocked off my feet. The music itself is fairly good. However, the vocals are lacking. If he was a better vocalist, the album would be much better. His vocal delivery is very dry and monotone. Think Ryan Cabrera but less talented vocally. Anyway, the CD is alright and I don't feel like I was ripped off being as I only paid 10 dollars for it. However, I just wish he'd mix it up when it comes to his vocal delivery... it's too talkie. The best song is ""Trouble"". Check it out if you're bored with your current CDs, as I was. However, if you want something better, try Paolo Nutini's These Streets."
3,"Tuneful, but indistinct power pop","This modern William Tell cut his alt-rock teeth as rhythm guitarist for the Orange County bred Something Corporate. Just as the band was beginning to gain national traction, Tell bolted to pursue a solo career. Three years of writing and touring later, he's released a debut that leaves behind the punk and emo influences of his former band, and dives headlong into the world of power pop. Chime has replaced buzz, and angst has replaced moping and his melodic hooks are more anthemic than his former band's.Producer Thom Panunzio (who also mixed) has added the layers of major label polish that he perfected on albums by Sheryl Crow, No Doubt, Tom Petty and others. The result is often more calculated than buffed, more form than substance, and though it hits all the right notes it failing to resonate emotionally. This album sounds good, but neither Tell's voice nor his lyrics draw you back to live these songs a second time. [2007 hyperbolium dot com]"
2,unoriginal,"The history books say that William Tell was a Swiss national hero in the 15th century of debatable historical authenticity. What's much less debatable is that the Southern Cal pop artist with the identical moniker is unlikely to create nearly the same legend.William Tell's new album ""You Can Hold Me Down"" was released on March 13th, by New Door Records. It is Tell's first solo effort after his work with the band Something Corporate. A generic pop album, Tell majors in catchy hooks and sing-along type tunes, intertwined with forgettable lyrics. There's nothing particularly second-rate about the album, just not much that's memorable. Highlights include the driving ""Slipping Down,"" as Tell's energy provides a nice contrast from his sappier piano ballads. After a couple spin's Tell's bouncy choruses and feigned anxiety grow distinctly monotonous.Not to say it's so bad you might want to fire an arrow at his head. But here's guessing you'll turn the stereo down."
1,Black Jack : Two-Fisted Surgeon,"It's nothing interesting, just as the cartoon! Al same! So if you watched the cartoon, don't read it!"
4,Fun stuff.,"Osamu Tezuka, Black Jack: Two-Fisted Surgeon (ViZ, 1987)Black Jack continues with more tales of Black Jack's exploits, more revelations about his past, and more exploration of the weird, weird relationship between Black Jack and his assistant/wife/ghostly pal/whatever she is. (The story of Black Jack trying to get her enrolled in school is priceless.) A fun series, and I can't wait to see where Tezuka took it after this. ***"
4,good show bad slot,"This is a REALLY good show unfortunately it was paired against Private Practice so it is a difficult decision on what to watch. I however have chosen this show and am glad I did, it keeps me very entertained and on my toes, you have to pay close attention or you can get lost but I love Michelle Ryan in her role and I am sooooo happy to see Isiah Washington on tv again, his role is great."
3,One Important Question,"Hey, I don't watch shows like this expecting Emma Thompson doing Shakespeare! For a guilty pleasure it was fun enough. And it raised one important question for our time: ""Who decides what's right?"""
1,Please release the original Six Million Dollar Man in quality DVD,Nope. Can't recommend this. Dull and cliché story. Please will someone release a quality remaster of the original Six Million Dollar Man on DVD for Region 1.
1,"I WANT THE ORIGINAL BIONIC WOMAN, NOT THIS!","I got all excited when I saw the release of THE BIONIC WOMAN. Unfortunately, it is not the definitive 70's series starring Lindsey Wagoner. Enough said. Even NBC doesnt want this bionic turkey. Please release the original!!!!"
2,Too much unnecessary sexual content & violence,"I was appalled by the violence and sexual content in this show. No there are no full on sex scenes but several scenes where it goes too far in my opinion. The violence is also over the top in my view. I found the acting to be good and the storyline to have potential, but just like Eick's ""reinvented"" Battlestar Galactica, the bad far outweighs the good. Apparently Eick's reinventions always require adding sex and violence in order to sell the reinvention. I will pass on this show. I am an avid sci-fi fan. I have enjoyed Star Trek, Babylon 5, Quantum Leap and many other sci-fi shows, none which needed to rely on sex and violence to sell the show."
2,An average show - nothing special,"It was interesting to see 2 characters from Battlestar Galactica in the show, though one was probably a special guest. But the show's main character acting and lines were extremely weak.And the pilot was just plain boring. The bionic woman gets a grasp of her skills immediately, without any training, common, make it plausible.Acting and the lines of the script were so flat, I really felt that I should have fast forwarded the show to the end.I was originally looking forward to it, but I had to high expectations, by the end of the show, I was seeing fight scenes straight out of the matrix and other action flicks, and it bored me.Character development is crucial, and I didn't see it. Nothing compelling, and nothing to see here, just move on."
3,A letdown from the early buzz,"In a sf series promising to take a hard look at the ethical dilemmas of transhumanist trends, I was really disappointed that Jamie's sister, who was originally cast as deaf, was switched out with a hearing person. (Not only would this have offered more deaf actor visibility, but it would have provided an opportunity down the road to address the dilemma of, for example, Deaf cultural responses to cochlear implants.) The idea of a female being made into a cyborg against her will certainly has some legs (as it were), but overall the pilot hasn't convinced me that this series will ultimately be as smart as it aspires to be..."
4,I really enjoyed Bionic Woman,"I am absolutely fascinated with the development of androids, bionics, cyborgs, and robotics. So well-produced shows like ""Bionic Woman"" are right up my alley. I think that Michelle Ryan did a wonderful job as the new Jaime Sommers. I also loved Katee Sackhoff as Sarah Corvus. Watching the DVD without commercials really brings home the potential this show had. NBC did not give it a proper chance."
2,Lame,"While other aspects of the pilot were decent, the writing was awful. Don't expect the series to be any better."
1,What a waste of my precious time...,Writing-poor. Characters-undeveloped. Acting-awkward. Special Effects-funny (at best). Simply a pathetic attempt at another superhero show. Smallville and Heroes have that covered. Skip it.
2,First David Eick version was better,"The first version of the show produced by David Eick without interference from NBC was much better. Dark, edgy, quirky. Then NBC executives got afraid that Battlestar Galactica's dark mood was what killed the show in its third season (it wasn't, just bad writers). NBC ordered recasting and reshooting. (Mae Whitman had been great as Jamie's deaf sister!) The result is this boring, committee-produced monstrosity. Flat, stale, boring and ultimately unprofitable. I won't watch it. Hopefully, Life and Pushing Up Daisies can save the new TV season."
2,not so good,"I really wanted to like this show. Visually its great but there was little to no plot. If NBC wants me to keep watching this show they need to get an actual storyline. I thought Katee Sackoff was great. I'll hang in there though, hoping for improvement."
2,Recycle This One,"This show was like a love child between the Scarecrow and the Tin Man from ""Wizard of Oz"": lacking both a heart and a brain. The first ten minutes--perhaps the most critical--seemed forced and rushed, and most of the plot developments afterwards I could see coming a mile away. The only redeeming quality of this show was Katee Sackhoff (AKA Starbuck fromBattlestar Galactica - Season One), but she isn't enough to save this one."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I rarely comment on products, but this one was so abysmal, I must. No fan of the original series, this one is a complete and total waste of time. Acting, story, dialogue, production value all disappoint. Don't waste your time..."
1,They can't be serious,"We should consider it a blessing that this stinker of a series lasted eight episodes. And to think that one reviewer thought the original Bionic Woman was much worse than this crap!This updated version of Jamie Sommers wears boots with an uncomfortable heel whenever she goes on a mission. Imagine running sixty miles per hour in shoes like that. The creators of the show sure did, which is why they're most likely on the unemployment line.This vacuous excuse for a television show is strictly for the teen demographic who don't want thought provoking programming in their lives.For those of you who fondly remember the original series, the one and only Lindsay Wagner, please do yourselves a favor and don't even consider renting or purchasing this lame show.If I can't reach you on some deeper level, then I'll leave you with these choice words: ""If I'm lying, I'm dying."""
1,Absolute waste of time!!!,The handling of this ahow was not even worthy of using the well established title. It is fast and dark like the rest of the garbage on tv today. They should not have used the Bionic Woman title. The original was a great role model for kids. The creator of the new show forgot to put the heart into it and didn't have a clue as to what he was doing. He should have watched the old show to see how real talent and production values were made. Case closed!
3,Bionic Woman- volume one review,"The only problem I had with the new bionic woman is the fact that it had been compared too much to the original and never really had a chance to grow thanks to a bunch of union idiots that got greedy. I for one have watched every episode on nbc.com and was hooked. Yes the show did change hands with writers and producers, and hardly had time to grow an audience when the plug, though not yet confirmed was pulled. I do hope that nbc will give this exceptional series another chance, and if not at least let the rest of us get a chance to see the final episodes. Michelle ryan and the rest of the cast did a great job and it's sad to see yet another real series be thrown onto the fire."
2,It can only get better from here.,"I was looking forward to this. But it chased my wife from the room within the first fifteen minutes; I made it through the hour out of sheer stubbornness, believing it had to get better.It didn't.Perhaps the reinvention of Jamie Sommers as a more telegenic Robocop - they even brought back Miguel Ferrer! - will settle down at some point. But I won't be around to see it."
3,"Not Battlestar, no matter how hard they are trying","You can see the Battlestar ethic both in-front and behind the camera here in the new Bionic Woman. Problem is, you can also see all the spots where the network got wishy-washy and made them ground down the sharp edges (the edges that make Battlestar so good).I will probably watch a few more, but if the lead doesn't get stronger (it seems they chose her to look the part rather than acting skill), and the network pablum level doesn't go down a bit, its unlikely I will stick with it."
3,A choppy affair,The action is good.The roots are there.The storyline is weak and the action sequences and flow feel disjointed.
4,great start,Like the tone and the two female leads (Ryan and Sackhoff) in the pilot. Better than expected.
3,Bad example to young women,"I liked it for the most part, being a fan of the original, but I could have done without them making her a 24 year old pregnant by her 40 year old boyfriend."
3,Two and a half stars is about right,"I was really looking forward to this pilot, but now that I've seen it, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. This was all they could come up with? As other posters have mentioned, it all feels very rushed, almost as though they had to cram a 2-hour pilot into one, choosing only the highlights to include. And I couldn't help but wonder what happened to the deaf sister that was so prominently featured in previous highlights (and an earlier version of the pilot)? That would have been something original and interesting. As it is, this was very stylish, but there was little in the way of real substance. I'll probably watch the first few episodes, but unless this really picks up, and fast, I won't be around much longer than that. Surprised that this was the mediocre pilot and Chuck, which I had little hope for, turned out to really be outstanding."
3,Good start but a little to stylistic,"As far as pilots goes this one wasn't bad, but I just felt that a lot of the camera work was to overly stylistic. It had a very Matrix like feel which I believe is the wrong approach. Also it was very similar to Pain Killer Jane but with more whining by the lead."
4,Looks like a promising new series,"I found the pilot very entertaining and overall the lead characters were compelling (nice to see ""Starbuck"" in other roles). I agree about the teen sister being annoying and seems like a very disposable character. I could do without that dynamic in the series.Also the chemistry wasn't that compelling between her and the professor. But despite it's faults I'm very interesting in seeing what direction this reimaging of the series and character heads in."
3,A Promising Start,"As a Battlestar Galactica fan--and a fan of kick-butt heroines--I've been looking forward to this show. Overall, the pilot was entertaining and fast-paced. My only concern, enough that I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5, is that I wasn't able to connect much to this Jamie. I'm not sure if it's because of the actress, or because the fast pace didn't give us a lot of time to bond with her, but... she seemed more of a victim of circumstance, even before the accident that turns her bionic, than a creator of her own destiny. Maybe that's the point, since by the end of the episode, she's beginning to take charge. But it will take more episodes for me to recommend it 100%. On the other hand, I'll be there watching at least several more episodes, to be sure!"
1,Talk about Boring,"I have to admit I went into watching this with a certain amount of skepticism but after watching I can't say that I was wrong. The acting was bad, the dialogue was bad and the pacing was terrible. Even the actions scenes weren't that enjoyable. I can't say that I will be tuning into this series this fall."
2,Bionic blunder...,"Pros: Interesting retelling of the origin story. Cute leading lady. Decent cinematography.Cons: Terrible dialogue. Poor execution of dialogue. No chemistry between any of the characters. (Bionic Woman's nemesis didn't seem menacing; she was more ""too cool for this dialogue"".) Goofy execution of ""chinese flying"" special effect."
2,Bionic Mediocrity :-(~,"I was so looking forward to a resurgence of sci-fi cool. When I heard that the creators of Battlestar Galactica were involved in the Bionic Woman, I thought how could I go wrong...? Boy did it go wrong! The B.W. pilot was a mish mash of poor character development, cheap looking special effects, even cheaper sound effects (what was with that Fred Flintstone foot pitter patter when the B.W. was supposed to be running fast?) and very poor choices in the hideous score music. I found myself wincing my eyes at the trite dialog all throughout and I also had a great deal of difficulty believing that Jaime didn't want to just march right back down to that mountain bunker and get the other arm fixed after that fight with the superior cyborg Katee Sackhoff. I really found myself not caring very much for any of the characters in B.W. because they just weren't that interesting."
2,No connection with characters,"I watched it and really don't see where it is going. I didn't feel any connection with the characters at all.There needed to be a bigger buildup or something and it just seemed to kind of throw you into a disjointed storyline.I will watch a few more episodes, but the first one isn't giving me much hope."
3,Left Wanting More,"As a hardcore BSG fan, I wanted to want this more. I was left feeling like the story was rushed just in case we never got to see episode 2. Once day Jamie is a bartender and several days later she is a bionic bartender? Come on. The Pilot could have been 1/2 the first season if not rushed. However, even with all this, I enjoyed."
3,Welcome to the year 2007,"This remake took me by surprise. Sure it was not the greatest pilot episode, but it is good and yanks you in. There is so much potential for this series and I am happy to see the 70's ""camp"" is gone. Don't get me wrong. I loved both the Six million dollar man & Bionic woman. I grew up with the series. It's great to see that this remake has been updated and they are going for a edgy show for our time .I can see NBC holding on to this series that can build a fan base with time and help the peacock network rise in the ratings game. They could even put the Bionic Woman after Heroes if the Wednesday nite slot does not work. After viewing this pilot, I think Jaime will hold her own against Private Practice.I liked the first episode and look forward to seeing more. Here's to a full season and more of Bionic Woman !"
3,"not too bad, show could catch on","I was never a fan of the first Bionic Woman, so I can't compare it.This show was OK.May watch again. The show was easy to figure out in places. The show could catch on, or maybe not if the original fans give it bad reviews. Also the price tag to fix the lady really went up from only 25 -30 years ago. lol"
4,Mixing Old and New,"I think this new seris is great I really liked it. It looks like there are somethings from the past Bionic Woman show with a lot new stuff to keep you guessing. The cast is great and the production is very sleek. It is strange how they gave her the same name as the old show. I was expecting a new name. All in all my Tivo is set to recorded this show every week. I am glad NBC is going with more dramatic shows and getting away from the stupid comdey's (Earl, Studio somthing and The office and 30 rock) All bad shows but somebody is watching them."
4,Yesterday Meets Today - GIS is Now,"This pilot episode was well done and appears to be ready for prime time. In the world where reality TV is king, this show will be a refreshing change.The story was good enough to keep my interest for the entire show. I was a fan of the Bionic shows of the 70's and this brings a 30 year-old concept into the current day.The technology is interesting, although, we are now more bionic and more expensive than we used to be.For a pilot, there was good character development and plenty of sub-plots in addition to the ""getting used to being bionic"" story.The special effects were good, and the introduction to the bionic features and functionality were also nicely done.I will need a few more episodes to fully determine good from bad, but it will be worth the wait.Enjoy and bring some popcorn for the 43 minute bionic excitement.This was an excellent distraction from the woes of the CY-08 budget preparation cycle."
2,No suprises.,I watched this on amazon video because I missed the series when it came out. I remember the original series. It had a certain campy feel even then. This new series tried to do too much at once. I think they took a movie script and tried to turn it into a series by spreading the plot out.If you are a hardcore fan of the original you may want to check it out but not worth watching otherwise. Typical hollywood special effects and weak plot with dialogue that is laughable.
2,I can see why this got cancelled.,"I bought this box set on Amazon because I only paid a few dollars for it (used). Although I wasn't around for the original series, I watched them all and enjoyed them.That said, I had high hopes that this would be a good series too, but it wasn't. The characters were not developed well, and there wasn't a good plot line. Part of what made the original series work was that Jaime Sommers was unique, a one-of-a-kind bionic woman. This one tried to have a second bionic woman, who was villainous and who caused the accident which caused Jaime to need bionics. It really didn't work for me. Perhaps if the show had lasted, the writers could have resolved some of the many holes/inconsistencies in the story... but maybe if they hadn't had these issues, the show could have survived.Still, all in all, I can definitely see why it got cancelled, but it might be worth the price of shipping to you."
4,Gone too soon,"This show could have gone all kinds of places, but as usual, the networks didn't give it a fair chance. But that's how it always goes. Would have loved to see where it could have gone. DVDs are good and I have enjoyed them tremendously."
1,"Gorgeous Bionic Woman, LOUSY SHOW","I love Michelle Ryan.I wish I had read the reviews before I unboxed the season. SHAME ON ME.Aside from having a leading lady straight from Heaven, this show SUCKS.That's why there were only eight episodes, which, in this case, was 9 too many.The only reason I watched all of the episodes was because I actually paid for them.I wish I could get my money back. If you're thinking about spending your money on this show, please don't.The only thing you'll get for your money is regret."
3,Not that bad,"This re-make of the classic series Bionic Woman is not as wretched as some would like to say. Overall it suffers from a slightly dull athmosphere, and it is true that the writing could have been tighter but the acting is rather good and the effects are first-rate even if they are somewhat in the background. So the story is quite simple, underachieving bartender Jamie Summers is almost killed during an accident and re-built by her experimental-surgeon boyfriend. Afterwards it is quite straightforward. But as I wrote it is not as bad as some other reviewers put it."
2,What about the original?,"I would rather have the ORIGINAL SERIES that this one. The original one, with Lindsay Wagner, was much more better that this poor copy. Please put the original series seasons on DVD."
5,HOW ABOUT BLU-RAY,"I really liked this show and I would like to own a copy of it, however it would be better if the new TV shows would start coming out in Blu-ray. I don't want to have to buy TV shows twice. Please pass this info on to the studios's."
1,Don't quit you iTunes.,I'd heard Unbox was a mess when it debuted but I thought they would've gotten their act together by now. I was wrong. This player is a disaster. It took over 20 minutes to install and still doesn't work. Avoid.
1,Category: Stupid and unartistic,I was so incredibly bored by this remake of an already boring TV series that I about wanted to shoot myself for wasting the time to watch it!!
1,Sorry Amazon - Take a Hike NBC,I'm primarily a Mac user though I have a PC for the few things I cannot do with my Mac. Watching TV shows shouldn't be one of those things.Amazon - your DRM is unacceptable and since you aren't compatible with the MacOS I'm not even willing to hold my nose to use Unboxed.NBC - your greed and cluelessness is incredible. Remember iTunes? I'm still using it and until you do to I guess if I miss one of your shows I just miss it.
2,Weak. Clichéd.,"The premise is great. The acting is quite good. The story line is completely clichéd and weak, to the point where the show is utterly boring."
4,Bionic Woman Remade,"I was a fan of the original and like the new version so far...they did try to cram too much stuff in the pilot, so the story line is kinda choppy. The creator of the new Battlestar Galactica is also behind this one, so it was cool to see ""Chief"" and ""Starbuck"" in this new series. The leading actress is pretty good looking - not smokin but still hot."
2,"Modernized, dark, violent, angst Bionic Woman","This new Bionic Woman is ok and even a little memorable. I predict it will not last on tv very long. Its too well made, dark, violent, and angst-ridden (The daughter character helps amp that up). The new Jamie Somers is rugged and easy on the eyes (then again so was the original). The pilot sets up the series well - hinting at some baddies. I think several of the female characters, including a stalwart rugged actress from Battlestar Galactica, look way too much like mannequins. They have far too much makeup on and one scene, bizarre thick red lips. The stylized female cat fight on the roof in the rain was engaging - but overall I think the show needs a little estrogen NOT more testosterone.At one point the Bionic Woman says ""You made me a soldier"". I can see this series going that way but I urge the director to keep Jamie a lady and a caring mom too."
3,Not convinced yet,"I wanted so much to love this episode but to be honest it wasn't that enjoyable. With so many Battlestar Galactica Alumni in the show i had high expectations. It was a bit too melodramatic for my taste, too stylized in parts and jumped around quite a bit which effected the whole flow of the episode for me anyway. The lead is likeable enough and her nemesis played by Katie Sackhoff (Starbuck) was quite effective but most of the other characters were pretty much forgettable. Personally, i will keep watching with the hope that things will improve."
4,"So far, so good, and let's stay on topic, people?","I'm a couple of episodes behind, but I've been enjoying the new Bionic Woman so far. I like the feel of the show, and the darker edge to it.I do have one other comment to make, though, regarding not the show but the reviews posted here -- If you want to complain about the Unbox service, the Unbox Player software, or that it isn't available for your OS of choice, please DO NOT make your complaint as a one-star review of a show, while saying nothing at all about the show. (Or a ""review"" that's a rebuttal to said complaints, but says nothing about the show, either!) I've gone through all the reviews for this show and flagged all of these ""non-reviews"" as inappropriate. Hopefully someone at Amazon will take notice and delete them. It is not at all helpful to other users of the site to have a show's average rating pulled down by one-star ""reviews"" that aren't about the show at all. (End Soapbox Mode)"
1,What's missing?,"Oh ya... where's episode #8.... I thought it just didn't download or something. So hit check for purchases in Unbox Player's Settings menu. Nothing. So naturally went to unbox site. Goes from 7 to 9. Where's episode 8? Not like the season hasn't progressed that far yet, since it has, episode 9 downloaded fine, 8's not even listed."
2,Where's episode 8,Ok I signed up for this so I wouldn't have to remebr to Record the show myself..But now theres a Missing episode...does that mean the Amazon can't get ALL the episode...
5,I LOVE this service!!!,"I can't say enough good things about this service. I, too, am a Mac user -- but I'm also a TiVo subscriber and I love being able to choose a movie or TV episode online -- from wherever I am -- and come home to find it waiting for me on my TiVo. I especially like how they have most of their TV show offerings from the NBC-family of stations like SciFi. Plus there are no commercials and the quality is superb. (I only wish they had ""Smallville"" on here.) I am hoping that as the service grows and improves that more of the obscure shows from NBC's past that have not made it to DVD will be made available like ""Man from Atlantis"" and ""Gemini Man."" It was a treat to find the old series ""Logan's Run"" on Unbox. Thank you folks for all you do and I love your service!!!"
2,bionic woman,Not great and yet not bad.The major issue with this show and/or format is the lack of support for things that are not windows. I also dislike amazon dictating that I can only use the video players they select and their software only. On the plus side the the videos do seem to come back if you lose data because of hardware issues or viruses.p.s.no mac support:( not good!
1,Worst Remake,This is definitely one the worst remakes I have ever seen and I liked the hulk movie. I think they should can this show soon and take it off the air.
3,i wish i could rate her boyfriend,"This pilot flys along. Why would the worlds most brilliant doctor be dating a bartender ""she is different""... why are they bound together, ""she was pregnant with his child before the accident"" so she puts up with being turned into a cybernetic weapon after a little yelling and starts to like it. wait, she was pregnant during their discussion about why they are dating. you know those bartenders, oh, and they did it to some other chick and she didn't like it and turned against them so we have a super powered enemy linked to the main characters.i wish the heroine was a little hotter, but they want creds with the female audience that watched the old show. i think the doctor is a a-hole playing god with the poor jamie character. i guess they will start to walk away from the origin and make us like him pretty soon.Eh. not bad, a lot of action and good stunts. is oscar still alive for cameos? I'm sure steve is up for it. cell phone commercials last i saw him."
1,I don't know,I have a Mac and was not able to download it. I have seen the series since and it is terrible. I don't think it is on anymore. Where is Steve Austin?
3,Bionic Woman was Starting to Get Interesting,"When this show first started, I was skeptical if I could give my heart to it as I did with the original series ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" and ""The Bionic Woman"" of the 1970's.After I sat through a few episodes, I was starting to get into it, hoping they would do a new fembot battle as in the original series.I'm sorry this show was killed by the writer's strike. I would have liked to see how it developed.I honestly wish a US formatted DVD would come out for the original ""The Bionic Woman"" and ""The Six Million Dollar Man"". I'd love to see those again though I know the effects will not seem a spectacular now as they did in the '70's."
2,Un-Impressed,"This review is just for the pilot episode. I don't know if the rest of the series is better, but quite frankly, it can only get better. The over-glossed production and Matrix-like effects can't distract from a flat, under-articulated plot and character development. I finished watching the 43 minutes of show with little to no concern for the characters. The lead actress is great, but, she's not enough reason for me to stick around. Unless they get better dialogue writers, better stage producers so the actor's don't stand around in awkward poses and they start to give an emotional interest in these characters, I can see this over-hyped, over-produced show lasting all of eight episodes. But, it may improve and wind up lasting eight SEASONS.For me, I'll be passing on ""Bionic Woman"" this fall."
2,Blasé typical application of soap relying on a snappy title,This is typical filler for those times when there is nothing else to present on TV. This is a standard soap opera with a few not to many quasi-sci-fi sprinkled in with no logic.Michelle Ryan is cute but there are a lot of cute actresses. I wish her luck in finding a vehicle with redeeming social value and not this mindless rehash of old plots.Panasonic DMR-EZ47V Up-Converting 1080p DVD-Recorder/VCR Combo with Built In Tuner
3,WHAT GIVES?,"So why would they leave her disadvantaged with only one arm, eye and ear Bionic? Yes, both her legs are bionic, but as long as they had her on the table why not do the job right? Pretty retarded if you ask me. Especially compared to Sarah's obvious superiority."
1,I DIDNT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!,WHATS GOING ON? I KEEP SEEING THESE TV SHOWS BEING BOUGHT I DIDNT BUY ANY OF THEM? I OBVIOUSLY NEED HELP WITH THIS SOMEONE CONTACT ME PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Bionic Effects,"The special effects of this one season series is the star of the reactivated Bionic Woman. It really does not pack the impact of the original series' acting, family viewing, and plots.. Good special effects made it good viewing and that is about it as the cancellation after teh first season sort of indicates."
2,So much promise just to fall flat on it's bionic face,"The pilot was good. Not amazing but it was well done.However as the series has progressed, not so much. Her sister is annoying and I get the tension is needed but something about her that makes her worse than the average TV teenager.The main character and her new love interest is just boring. There is a lot of action but no adventure.The only good parts is the prettiness of Will Yun-Lee, the awesome characters played by Molly Price & Miguel Ferrer who usually are the best things in OK shows and Kevin Rankin who plays a smartass guy who is constantly in Jamie's ear.This show has some good potential with it's supporting cast and their story. But I'm done with the show."
3,bi-yawnic start,"I thought the pilot was so-so. The relationship between Jamie Summer and her boyfriend wasn't convincing at all. I guess we find out why at the end. I actually like Katee Sackhoff better. However, the show is getting better with the recent episodes. I will continue to watch to see how it develops."
3,Hmmm ....no Oscar Goldman???,"I see the female cop ""Faith"" from Third Watch dyed her hair blond....oh The Bionic Woman...well they was right when they said this isn't your mother's Bionic Woman.Now that was a classic,easy to follow storyline,Jamie Somer tennis pro gets injured when her chute fails to open.The new Bionic Woman gets run down by a Mack Truck and she only loses an arm,an eye and two legs.Not with that impact she should have been mangled without recognition.I wasn't feeling the whole preggy storyline and the out of control lil sis that was left on the door step.The little sister character is annoying as anything,I can see why the father dumped her.The visuals are nothing to write home about and after watching the second episode,I'm already bored.Sci-fi should put the original Bionic Woman on at the same time this one is on and see who gets better ratings.I can see why Lindsey Wagner had nothing to say about this next generation Bionics..."
3,Somewhat scattered,This was all over the place for a pilot. I didn't much care for it. The fight between the 1/2 bionic woman and the fully bionic woman seems like it was lifted from the terminator. I kept rewinding wondering who that was and why I cared. Sorry NBC. Really liked your other shows though.
3,Not sure at all,"Well Its hard to say when a product really helps because you would need to keep everything else constat in order to see the changes, but in general i can say i didnt see any difference at all."
3,small difference,"I think but im not sure, it may have helped a little but not a lot. You wont notice a huge gain but if your looking to save a few cents I guess it dose what it says but not as dramatically as it says. Also it is very very easy to put on."
3,Questioning authenticity of Le Creuset loaf pan,"I bought the 1.05 Le Creuset loaf pan and it said ""made in Thailand"" on a stick- on label. Would someone tell me if this is an Asian fake or is Le C outsourcing their products too? Would the enamel be lead free?"
5,Quality cookware !!,I have totally gone to a red kitchen and love all of Le Creuset products !! It is the perfect cooking companion for anything you want to cook.
5,Why do I love Frog and Toad?,"Why do I love Frog and Toad? I'm not really sure. Not much really happens in these stories. The illustrations are beautiful but rather small. The eponymous friends carry on their friendship through mild misunderstandings and misadventures, always ready to forgive each other and forget. These gentle stories are among my favorite kids' books. I have fond memories of Frog and Toad from my childhood, and I never tire of re-reading them to my 4-year-old daughter. She seems to like them, too."
5,An excellent textbook for first-year college students.,"This book provides a good range of diverse materials for a teacher in a first year English course. There are multiple genres and themes, a section of famous paintings for discussions (useful for discussions on literature and art), among other helpful features. The Conscious Reader is an antidote to readers which have the same standard writing for student use."
5,"Really, completely, extremely entertaining!!!!! It has great comedy, adventure, mystery and fun.","I have watched this several times, and enjoy it more each time. It fun, clean, and exciting!"
4,Version 5.0,"I purchased the DVD format which has very poor sound quality. More like 2.0 rather than 5.0. The Blu Ray is truly 5.0!!! If you have surround sound, do not purchase the DVD, or you will be extremely disppointed as I was. B-ray is the way to go! This is a must have for Commodore or LRichie fans."
1,The BD does not play...,"I think it has a serious recording problem. My player is a Denon 3800BDCI and the BD just plays the trailer and then it stop... Well, I was refunded by Amazon but I lost money..."
4,lionel richie live,"p urchased blu ray from amazon,picture quality good plus,and sound good plus.disc played fine,but there was some streakinglines thru the menue,otherwise enjoyed the disc"
5,A must have!,"I got into Elton a couple years ago, and since I didn't have any of his stuff, I started out with this cd. It's great!! I could listen to it over and over again. The last few songs I'm not too fond of, but that's only because I'm not crazy about his newer stuff."
5,you can tell everybody these are your songs,"elton john's greatest hits 1970-2002 has 34 classic songs,plus a limited-edition bonus disc with 4 more songs. your song starts things off nicely.i also like the songs tiny dancer(later redone by tim mcgraw.),crocidile rock,island girl,sorry seems to be the hardest word, don't go breaking my heart,i'm still standing,sad dongs(say so much), can you feel the love tonight,iwant love,and this train doesn't stop here anymore.the bonus disc is good too. thanks for the music elton. ed wilson"
4,Not Quite Right,"This is a superb collection, but as other intrepid reviewers have noted, there are a few things missing, specifically ""Mona Lisa And Mad Hatters."" Still, following in the footsteps of seemingly every other classic rocker who has produced a double CD of Greatest Hits, this one at least satiates a good Elton John fix. His collaborations with Taupin are still jaw dropping, and the layers of instrumentation are quite simply amazing. You will, I promise, remember why you thought he was so amazing in the first place."
5,Excellent compilation,This is an awesome 2-disc set and a must have for any Elton John fan. Every song is a good one and you won't find yourself hitting the skip button every other song. A great buy!
3,Too Many Repeats,"Long-time E.J. fans will be very familiar with the first disk of this set - the songs pretty much sum up the first two ""Greatest Hits"" albums John has put out. I'll probably just download a few of the songs from the second disc. Y waste good money in today's economy?"
5,fantastic!,I had tickets to an Elton John concert and wanted to get up to speed on his music and i was not disappointed! This was a great compilation of his songs - and i loved every single one! Both CDs were great and i didn't find myself skipping any of the songs like i do when i listen to other CDS.
4,Not Bad But Missing some songs,"I bought this disc for the selection of John's tunes, however, the actual tracks on the discs are not what are listed on this site. Levon and Little Jeannie are missing. Did I get a bum copy? It's good anyways."
5,Elton John Greatest hits,I grew up on Elton John. Takes me back to a much simpler time. Elton is the greatest singer/songwriter!
3,Missing Hits and Flawed Mastering,"The song ""Daniel"" is an inexplicably messed up master that fades out just seconds before the actual ending. Never heard that before... Another reviewer also mentioned that Honky Cat and Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting were edited (early fades). Other reviewers complain about the flat or EQ'd mastering problems. The credits say ""various songs"" remastered by Gus Dudgeon - this would explain the uneven quality (unacceptable from a major label like Universal/UTV).As many have pointed out, this set is missing the #1 hit ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" (unforgivable) as well as the top 10 hits ""Mama Can't Buy You Love"" and ""Empty Garden"". There's several lame 90's tunes on disc two to make it even worse.Universal's Gold series has done many new collections that had EVERY hit by major artists - so it can be done."
4,more of the same,"Being a Elton John fan for over twenty years I was very happy to see that he would be releasing a new greatest hits disc this year.It is filled with some of the best music that he and bernie (along with others)ever produced. This multi cd album is truely a must have for any true fan of Mr.John.This is a great album to get a real feel for Elton's body of work, but I beleve the other albums he made are also worth a look too."
4,A Great Collection,"I must say that this is definetely the best collection of Elton John songs. If you are a fan of Elton, this is a great album to get. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is because there are a few songs that I don't care for, however, it is still a great album."
4,i don't care if it's Lennon and McCartney !!!!,"WHAT ???? No ""LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS!!!"" you've got to be kidding. i don't care if it's lennon and mccartney and not john and taupen ! elton's version is the far superior version and spent 2 weeks at the top of the billboard singles chart.C'MON !!! ""BLUE EYES"" should be on here too !"
2,great collection but horrible recording,"I really want to like this cd but the sound is awful.Afwul? Surely you jest? its clear and loud. clear is ok. LOUD is not. Music is not supposed to to charactized by it's loudness regardless of the type of music being played.I mean how much bloody compressor did they use on this thing. Everything sounds LOUD. And it's the same loudness the whole song through. Ughhh. The results of this compressor magic are no soundstage, no dyanmics, and no enjoyment.The only thing this sounds ""good"" on are bargain basement electronics and speakers. I pray to baby jesus that they don't start de-naturalizing the majority of albums this way. Shudder.Maybe I'm being picky. But try listening to this thing on good equipment and see what i mean."
5,HITS that are GREAT !,"To not own this CD is to not have a serious music collection. Elton has crafted some of the best melodies in modern music. His soul shall forever live on due to his memorable collection of songs. This is a no brainer; you have to purchase this CD ! If you do not have the funds to purchase his entire collection of CDs, then opt for this product."
3,Fine Retrospective...But where's Tumbleweed songs?,"This is a nice compilation of the Radio-Friendly Era of Elton John. HOWEVER, I don't like the fact that the Tumbleweed Connection album was ignored. Not even 1 SONG? It's his best album, Hands down (in fact ""Tumbleweed"" is the only Elton album I pull off the shelf and play on a regular basis). Song's like ""Ballad of a well known gun"" and ""Son of your father"" are Elton classics, and their absences are glaring. So for that reason, I give ""Greatest Hits 1970-2002"" only 3 Stars."
5,Excellent Collection,"This set nicely assembles the bulk of Elton's hits, as we all know this set could have been three discs, the other reviews that preceed this one give an accurate list of songs the could have been included. The selection of songs are presented chronologically and both cd's are programmed to seventy nine minutes. The mastering of this set is awesome, it makes me wish they would rework ""To Be Continued....."" to this updated mastered sound. I truly enjoy all Elton's work and usually find one redeeming track in all his albums. The one track that I'm happy to own in this updated mastering is the original version of ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me.""For the casual fan, this is an excellent collection of Elton's smash hits, the one huge hit not here is ""Blue Eyes,"" which is available remastered on ""Love Songs,"" another excellent collection for the casual fan. For the money, this collection is well worth it."
5,Elton John - Greatest Hits 1970-2002,This is an excellent CD and has everything we were looking for. Amazon was easy to use with fast delivery and great quality. It fills a tremendous need.
4,just not enough!!!!!!!!!!!!,"when you talk about legends like sir elton john, these 2 discs are just not enough. there are so many more songs that should have been there but then it would have taken few more discs!!! anyway though this collection doesnt disappoint but it surely is incomplete!!!"
4,The,"Being more or less a new Elton John fan and being sixteen years old is kind of odd, of course you get the glares from the homophobes around school proclaiming (...)amogst other ignorant comments from the masses, but you cannot deny how great of an artist Elton is. I really enjoy his music and this album have been a lifesaver for me, it has every kind of music really, just pretty much to drive around and enjoy listening to ""Crocodile Rock"" or sitting in front of my computer listening to ""Your Song"" its a great experience deffinate buy."
3,Call Bob Ludwig to remaster this CD,"I love Elton John and did not think twice about spending more than 20 dollars for a CD. However, I was very disappointed that for the money and such a well known artist that the record company did not hire a professional to master this reissue.The levels of the songs are all over the place. I have not listened to it since. I have many reissues and this is the first time that I have been disappointed by the mastering or non mastering of a CD.It is very hard to reissue an artist whose music spans so many decades...Hence the problem with trying to leave the masters untouched. Depending on what year a song was released will determine how loud it is.Maybe when I get some time I will remaster this CD for myself, which is what I recommend. Import into your computer and adjust the levels so they are all equal. ""Your Song"" is much softer than some of the other cuts on the compilation. Other than that...I love it! thanks Giorgi B"
4,elton john greatest hits 1970 2002,"i wss pleased with this item though the last track sticks a bit other than that its in good codition,and it arrived in a relatively short time"
4,Good but not Great,"I am an Elton FANATIC!!! So naturally I bought this collection even though I had all of these songs on at least two albums. Everyone will agree Elton's earlier stuff was his best. The '80's produced few memorable songs and the '90's were well mediocre. The Lion King although good can not compare to ""Funeral for a Friend"" or ""Burn Down the Mission."" These two songs should have gone on this collection as should have ""Harmony"" ""Take Me to the Pilot"" and ""Hercules."" Elton will always be a phenominal piano player but his songwriting skills have deteriorated a little bit through out the years."
5,TRUE KING OF POP,"Elton John definitely has the edge over Michael Jackson as the true King Of Pop. This is a blockbuster package with many much more memorable hit singles included here, as well as his most famous key album tracks than the self proclaimed 'king of pop' could ever even claim during a career that has mostly fizzled in the past decade. Elton John just ""Keeps On Trucking"" up and down the charts, and this new collection should garner him a multi-platinum award. Elton John needs to release ""TO BE CONTINUED..."" Box Set #2 as soon as possible. This is an incredible ""must have"" collection of some of the grandest highlights of Elton John's career."
5,Dollars and (common) cents.,"I'm going to rate this CD based on a $1 per song cost to total cost for the entire CD (Apple and Rhapsody charge $1 per song).Elton John is good. This CD is even better. I was disappointed to learn that he didn't write a lick of his own lyrics (Bernie Taupin did). Elton John just wrote the music. And I guess we need to hear great music before we'll listen to the lyrics of a song.Amazon is currently selling the CD for $15. The good news is that there is $20 worth of great music on it. This CD is worth ever dollar and them some. The essential Elton John songs are: Disc 1 - Tracks 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15 & 16 (and I guess Candle In The Wind). Disc 2 - Tracks 1,3,4,5 & 6.Hope this helps.Darium June 2007"
3,Beware! Many songs edited!,"If you are a casual fan, this is a great collection. If you are a major fan like myself and looking for cleaner mixes of these great classics, BEWARE! Many of these songs are not the full versions! To fit another song on the disc, some songs have been chopped from their original length. Such a shame, this would have been a great collection!"
4,Pretty good if you don't mind . . .,"GREATEST HITS 1970-2002 lacks three essential Elton John singles: the number one smash ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,"" the top ten hit ""Mama Can't Buy You Love,"" and the Princess Diana tribute and another number one record, ""Candle In The Wind '97.""Two other big songs do not appear on this collection, albeit duets: ""That's What Friends Are For"" with Dionne Warwick and others, and ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"" with George Michael.If you don't mind missing any of those songs, GREATEST HITS 1970-2002 comprises the rest of Elton John's biggest hits."
2,An all mostsy,A good collection but would be a Great collection if one [1] song had not been omitted .MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER should have been on it .
5,Arrived on time and in good condition1,"The elton John cD arrived on time and in good condition, asadvertised!"
3,Not That Great,"This CD is not one of the best I've heard from Elton. The CD is kind of bland with only a few well known hits, not exactly what I would call a greatest hits CD.He, for the most part, let his fans down with this album. There was never a variance of rhythms or beats in his songs on this album.The tracks sounded as if the lyrics were just changed for each song except for the occasional upbeat song.But the CD does have its good parts. It is definetly an excellend CD for those nights when you are driving home and just want something peaceful to listen to. But it could easily put you to sleep. Definetly a good CD while you are trying to sleep as well. This CD is just not up to the caliber we have come to expect for both Elton's CDS and greatest hits CD's. He should have mized his love songs CD with this greatest hits CD. Putting the two of them together may have made this CD purchaseable."
4,Good listening!,"Elton John's most important and well-known songs are here in this 2-CD collection. Fans will certainly get a lot of pleasure out of this collection, but even just casual listeners (and I'm one of them) will enjoy hearing their favorite songs. No filler - just the best."
4,Great concert,"The concert is a very recommended one. It has the most of Elton's hits. The sound is great, especially in the DTS format.The stereo is also not bad, but not like the DTS.However, the video is not that good, when the DVD video can have much better quality.Overally it is a great release. Also available on Blu-ray."
1,ANOTHER ONE???????,How many GHs is this guy gonna keep putting out???? please Elton NO MORE!!!!!!!!!!! you were great in your hey day but please...stop....
5,Elton John,I love this CD I had it before gave my copy to my brotherand could not fine in stores I'm glad I found it on Amazon and had to get it fan of Elton John and have all his albums
5,best of the best--,all my EJ favoritesHow did I live without this set??--and is it posssible to wear out a cd?
5,Great Hits,Attended his concert is '08. I am 26 and love Elton John. This CD was $60 at the concert. Got it on here for under $20. Excellent classic songs. Who wouldn't love it.
4,A Good Collection On The Whole,"This Is Not At All A Bad Collection Of The Hits. As With Alot Of Compilations, Some Of The Choices Are A Bit Questionable. (Where Are Song For Guy And Passengers?) But On The Whole This Is A Good Review Of John's Work. It Also Contains Some Often Overlooked Gems Like Tiny Dancer And Little Jeannie. Pleasureable Listening."
5,Great collection,Great collection of the best Elton John hits around. I have a few of the collections and this is the best. If your a fan you need this album.
3,elton john - greatest hits 1970 - 2002,"while the delivery and quality was not an issue, the version supplied was not the one wanted. perhaps a contents list for CD's would allow people to make an informed choice on the version being purchased."
4,the man the myth the legend,Elton John is the man I just started to enjoy his music and i feel i have missed out alot. He has a great selection of songs different syles and genere. I feel Mona lisa and madhatter should have been on there and sopme more older stuff. Im 16 I have AIM my sn is BFB257 if you wanna talk
2,"Half-Good , Half-Lame","The first disc in this two-disc collection is great (except for ""Candle in the Wind"", which was never much of a song but got popular because it piggy-backed on Princess Di's death). Your Song, Daniel, and other great tunes are on the first disc. But look at the playlist on disc 2... you might know one or two of them, but do you consider them 'greatest hits', or even 'okay songs'? Do you want to spend money to have them in your CD collection? Up to you, but I'm disappointed."
1,Where's the Beef?,"Elton John is one of a handful of preeminent songwriter/performers of the past half century. His work will be held as a standard for any individual who sits on a piano bench and puts his face to a microphone. About this album -- where is the sinew and muscle from this man's career? The albums ""Tumbleweed Connection,"" ""Madman Across the Water"" and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" contained masterpiece material. Where in the world is ""Burn Down the Mission,"" ""Love Lies Bleeding,"" ""Madman Across the Water"" and Good Lord knows how many others. Here's the question -- Who picked this stuff?"
2,I'd Rather Not,"Elton John,...is terrible on this disc. The songs, ""Melou, Melou"", ""Bride with Red"", ""Threaten Love Bast"" and etc, are just too tedious to non Elton Fans. A complete waste of time if you don't read his books first."
1,Customer's Complain,"Dear Sir/Madam:The CD I had purchased via your web site turned out to be great failure.The reason is that even there are two disks in the album with different labels, both CD ARE THE SAME.For our big embaressment it was a present to our work associate.Sincerely,Oleg Aliferov"
3,Yamamoto; The Man Who Menaced America,"Using his wealth of experience author John Deane Potter does a reasonably good job of documenting how Admiral Yamamoto directed the Japanese navy during the first half of the Pacific war. The average armchair historian has no choice but to assume that Potter got the story right, however, the book contains a number of errors that hopefully reflect poor editing rather than inadaquate research. Putting the gramatical errors, typos, incomplete sentences and obvious errors in dates aside,the book provides a fascinating look at an extraordinary militry personality who managed to be his own man within an unforgiving military system."
4,Good book for genealogy,"A good overall book for the genealogy of New Jersey cemetaries. Took a couple of weeks for the book to arrive, otherwise good service."
5,Excellent track!,"Tina is a very talented singer with quite a range in her vocals. The song not only grabs one's attentions with its lyrics but holds them with her tempo, and range. I loved this cd from the moment I first heard a clip and have been a fan ever since!"
5,What a voice!,"The first time that I heard Tina Arena I was in Miami. A friend of mine show me Tina Arena like a new pop sensation. At the time I bought her single. And after that, I became a big fan. And now, I have all her Cds."
4,Jump5-Accelerate(The Songbook),"I got this book from Barnes And Noble about 2 months ago and I was pretty impresed with the book,but it could be a little better.I take singing lessons and I like singing Jump5 music at singing lessons on the piano,but it sounds better with the music on the cd called Jump5-Accelerate.I don`t think these songs were meant to be played on the piano,but it is still a pretty good songbook.Reccomended for Jump5 lovers."
3,GOT RIPPED!,"The book was a great read for employment law; but when you think you have a case based on what you read in this book and get to the office and are charged $250 for consultation (1/2 hour)as he takes calls while meeting you, you start to feel a bit ripped off. All the info in the book that I thought made a case meant absolutely nothing when I went to meet this lawyer at his office. Before you consult, buy and read a couple of other books and get as much free consul as you can if at all possible..."
2,"Intriguing historical setting, then a big letdown.","This is a fast-paced book that describes interesting characters and scenes, with plenty of action. As it runs its course, the events continue to crescendo, then, when the reader is expecting the most, everything collapses. McHugh has left me feeling as if I've been taken -- the ending is so terribly slipshod and trite that it mocks any literate person. What a disappointment after so much anticipation."
5,Love cross-stitch? Try blackwork.,The patterns are easy to read. The creativity in design is more satisfying than regular cross-stitch as it's up to you to decide what pattern to choose to fill in the outlined space.
5,Great incense,"I haven't had much luck with most Gonesh Incense that I've tried. Some of the fragrances are not as strong as I would like when they burn, so I tend to go with a different brand if I see Gonesh alongside another brand with the same scent. But I purchased these because I loved the way they smelled in the package. And I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by these, and I will probably give some of the other Gonesh scents a try now. The sticks burn well, smell great while they burn, and the fragrance lasts for a long time after they are done."
2,No information on how to make complex table relationships,"This book makes no mention of Table Occurrences or Table Occurrence Groups, so if you plan to build or modify a database with many complex relationships, buy the Missing Manual book or the Filemaker Pro Business Applications book instead."
1,not for 8.5 at all,"This book sucks for all users, every level!Not only is this book extremely simple, like the previous reviews have said, but it is not updated for the 8.5 version. It is taken word-for-word directly from the FileMaker Pro 8.0 book, including the images of the screen layouts. Which makes it completely inaccurate for FileMaker 8.5.For example; In Ch 4, Building Your First Database, this book walks you though starting with setting field options, which won't work with version 8.5. You have to build tables, and then build fields within them.This book is a waste of money. Don't buy it unless you are running FileMaker 8.0, or older, you want a very simple database, and you have no experience or understanding of databases at all. Even then you should just buy the the 8.0 version; it will be cheaper (being the older version), and exactly the same."
1,Cyndi's Version Blows Celine's Out of Space!,"If you like modern music and real singers buy Cyndi's version, because Celine dion voice and style fits well the 70s and also is a great listening for mothers and fathers. Cyndi beside de pop Diva look and great vocal talent delivers this song like a GODESS. Listen to Cyndi TWELVE DEADLY CYN'S ""I Drove All Night"" and you will see why her version BLOWS OUT CELINE'S version. Cyndi's video of ""I Drove All Night"" is also fantastic. Ms. Lauper SHINES!!!!!!!!!! The DIVA bouces back!!!!!!!"
2,Sadly Butchered.,"Can Celine sing without over-dramatizing everything? Indeed, she does have a powerful voice. However, a great pipe does not constitute a great singer. As a matter of fact, her voice is down right annoying with all the shouting and scream. Everything has to be ended with a way over-produced note.People! This is a ROY ORBINSON's song! It is neither Cindy Lauper's nor Celine's. Listen to Orbinson's original recording and appreciate the spiritually bareness of the song. Cindy Lauper's version is way better than Ms Dion's melodramatic, ear-numbing screech."
4,Well done Celine - but Cyndi's is better.,"When I first heard Celine singing this on her Chrysler commercial campaign, I could hardly believe my ears. Celine had covered a Cyndi Lauper classic? Celine does a great job with her version which is aimed at the dance floors. Her voice sounds great and the song rocks.But once again, this proves in the inferiority of remakes. Beat for beat, vocal for vocal, Cyndi Lauper's version blows Celine's out of the atmosphere. Whereas Celine's is guided toward the club, Cyndi's version is haunting. Cyndi sings this song from the heart and captures the longing and desperation in her vocals. Buy both if you can (they're both good) but if you had to choose one or the other, buy Cyndi's."
3,LOVE CELINE BUT.........................,This is not for her. Her voice doesnt fit well in this song. Does not have the grit or sexiness of the far superior Cyndi Lauper version. I do love Celine but this beat also seems very generic and her voice doesnt seem to match the beat of the song.Listen its not terrible but there was no reason for this remake. Why dont they make a dance song for Celine that uses that AMAZING voice of hers instead of rehashing a song that doesnt need to be. Cyndi over Celine??? I cant believe i have to say Cyndi
2,very Average at best,I respect Her Vocal Range but this Song like so much of Her last Album leaves Me Numb.
5,Celine Fan,"My whole family loves Celine. She sings a great version of ""I Drove All Night"" I listen to this Cd in the car, and my kids like it too. Celine is the best!"
3,Nothing Special,"Well, I really like her voice but this song is not one of her best. She sounds good but I expected much more from her. Hex Hector Mix is very energetic and great to dance."
2,Buy Cyndi Lauper's instead,This song is not bad. Celine has a great voice. But on the other hand her performance lacks credibility and real passion. It's rather frigid specially when compared to Cyndi Lauper's version (included in her Twelve Deadly Cyns album.)Go buy that one instead and enjoy!!I hope the rest of Celine's album makes it worth buying. Certainly not this song.
1,Listen to CYNDI'S Version Instead!,"I don't have anything against Celine, but I think she fits better the 70's style. She sings well but I Drove All Night fits well in the voices of Cyndi Lauper and Roy. Cyndi gave us a ROCKY modern interpretation of it, and Roy gave us a country and sad interpretation of it. Not against Celine, but buy Cyndi Twelve Deadly Cyns because her version it is much better."
3,The one time I wanted Celine to oversing something...,"I Drove All Night is one of my favorite songs of all time! Romantic and not schamltzy(?), great lyrics, great hook... a perfect pop song. I love Cyndi's version the best, love Roy's too. When I heard that Celine was covering it, I was really really excited. I love Celine's version too, but IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER. If any song was written to have passion and to be oversung (something that Celine is always criticized for) it is this song! This could have become her trademark track if she went into the studio and came out bleeding from the ears nose and throat. It seems to me half sung. If she put all of her vocals in to it like she does with all her power ballads that just come off sounding like Mountain Dew commercials, it would have been a much better song."
1,I want my money back.,"I'm a big Cyndi Lauper fan, and kinda like Celine Dion (until now). So I was curious. But after she butchered ""I Drove All Night"", I want my money back. And even if you are a big fan of Celine, why would you buy this?!? It's obviously marketed to line her pockets. I heard she would stay silent to preserve her voice for shows. I wish she would do that in the studio, too."
2,Driving Down,"For Celine Dion, I think she had just hit her lowpowint at this song. Her cover of Cyndi Lauper's I Drove All Night really wasn't the same style we all know and love from the new Las Vegas Showgirl. Although Celine is making good headway in Las Vegas, the newest song she has done feels like the pits. It sometimes makes you want to go for the ballads she used to do like The Power Of Love and I'm Your Angel. I really didn't like this song, not at all."
2,more of the same,"Why ruin a good thing? The Roy Orbison version still rocks and sounds better than all of the digital computer chirps of this dance mix. And Cyndi Lauper packs more emotion (and more range) into one phrase than Celine does in an entire CD. Nothing in this version is nuanced. Try as you might, you'll never be able to discern one authentic heart-felt emotion. Just the same old musical breaks to unleash a series of computer enhanced high notes. Even the video is uninspired and tiresome."
4,Great Mix - but it's all been released before,"If you are anything like myself and are into Middle Eastern music then you may already have a lot of these songs on other compilations. So take a good look at the song list. If you don't already have most of these songs then definately buy this album.Even though I already have a lot of these songs this is a great mix of some great, great songs. A lot of these albums have one CD which is great and then the other one that we could do without but both these are solid. It's basically a greatest hits of Salon Oriental 1 through 4 as well as some other great songs and it flows so well. Just pop it in and let it play you will discover subtlties everytime you listen and your favorite song will keep changing."
1,Was NOT what I had in mind,"I had 2 issues with this DVD:1. I thought the songs will be the actual video clips they recorded, but instead every single song is part of their performance within a Mexican TV Show called ""En Vivo"".So, the quality of the video is old, the sound is not good, and I can't even hear the whole song because people are clapping their hands and singing along.2. The DVD came deffective.Video displays intermitent in some songs.On ""track 5"" los castigados, it plays like -10 seconds of the song and it jumps right back to the menu."
3,THE KOOL IS LUKE WARM.,THIS IS A GREAT GROUP OF ARTIST. I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO MELT THE CHARTS WITH THIS ONE. I PURCHASED THE CD BECAUSE I AM A TRUE FAN. COME ON! BRING THE NOISE!!
3,Not Kool enough,"This isn't the KATG I remember, many of the songs are slow, and there isn't any real funk on this CD. It sounds pleasant enough, but that's about all, it's just nice safe pleasant music."
2,Original no more.,"Had I stumbled across one of the first 16 cuts on this cd, I'd have no clue who this is. I realize that as artists and lead singers rotate, there's a variance in the music sometimes, but this has no ""orginal"" Kool & The Gang flavor with the exception of the last original cuts. Some groups can mix the new school flavor with the old school and make it work, unfortunately this doesn't work for Kool & The Gang on this cd, feel the boogie??On the flip side of that, The Bar-Kays' cd ""House Party"" maintains it's originality yet fuzes enough hip hop in to make it work without sacrificing that originality. When I first heard the first cut on their cd, I knew it was the Bar-Kays. Question is, would you know this was Kool & The Gang if you heard one of the first 16 cuts? - I wouldn't."
4,Good Book for Transitioning either way,"I am actually trained on InDesign, but when I started my position with a nonprofit org they still use Quark 5. I purchased this book to see if I can somehow convert concepts the other way around. This book did a lovely job of showing how to do the same task in Quark and InDesign. It's lifesaver. The only opportunity for change would be illustrations. There are illustrations provided, but I wish there were more. Besides that it's a great bang for your buck."
4,Great intro book!,"If you've never used Quark before, this is the perfect book for you! The book also has side by side instructions from Quark to InDesign. These two programs are really great for page layouts and I never knew how awesome the program was until I received this book and used everything almost to its potential. If you have Photoshop experience and want to learn more about Indesign, this may be a good book, though the interface is pretty much intuitive. The book is great, but I wished it showed more shortcuts...I rely on that more than the tools now!"
2,QuarkXpress to InDecision,"This book is not really for Quark users as really each entry is going to show you the Quark way then tell you the InDesign way and even if the Quark way is superior and easier you will be told that InDesign does it way better! It is just page after page of shameless ad hype for InDesign, which if you're buying this book you've already got InDesign so they really don't need to sell it to you. Except that with each page you are going to ask yourself why anyone would ever give up QuarkXpress for this miserable throwback to Pagemaker-- so I guess that's one reason why with every other page they have to try to sell you the idea.Save your money and get the Adobe Classroom."
1,Terrible software and customer service,"If you want to feel like you're on prehistoric times...just go for the QXpress software.* QXpress would never work* QXpresswould always crash, you would need to do long and endless phone calls to see how you can solve issues, you would need to enter a million numbers and letters on your activation code and even though, it won't work EVER* if you finally get in contact with QXpress customer support they would never help you and when you tell them about all of the issues...they would try to convince you to upgrade and pay $299, and when you explain that no because it did't work, they would be very disrespectful to you and leave the conversation without asking if you need anything else.I was a QXpress user for many years, but the involution of this software is way too much.My recommendation: use InDesign instead, no doubt.Thanks for reading my review."
1,Just a hideous game...,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is bar none the worst game tied to a movie license that I've ever played. The graphics are drab and lifeless, the controls are clunky, and the missions are boring and tedious. The game's only saving grace is the plethora of unlockables (CG in-game movies, theatrical clips, behind the scenes clips, stills, etc.) available to you as you progress through the game as well as a playable demo of a much better, currently unannounced, terminator game called T3: Redemption. There were times when I found myself playing the demo rather than the actual game itself. In it, you play as Arnold from a third person perspective as you blast away cyborgs and HK's on foot or on vehicle through a nuclear-scorched Los Angeles. This was the game that I should have been playing, not the rushed hack job I got instead. For die-hard fans, save you money till T3: Redemption comes out. Rise of the Machines by itself, is just an expensive demo."
3,good ok game,its pretty good game but myn locked up in the middle and wouldnt play again so i never finished this game but from what i played was good
1,A missed opportunity,"Unlike many others, I enjoyed the third Terminator film and was looking forward to playing the game. A fantastic demo starts the game with an extension of the film's storyline; this is a stunning sight, with great energy and amazing graphics, and then you play the game.......The controls are terrible, the action is repetitive and even the sound effects are annoying. Included on the disc is a demo of the next game titled 'Terminator 3: Redemption'. This has all the same flaws, the graphics are brilliant, but the gameplay is missing. If you are on the lookout for a great first person shooter, save your money for a copy of Halo."
4,People Come ON!!!!,"OK for anyone looking for a good Terminator game....... Buy this. It is a good game. It's everything a first person shooter can be. First off your Ahnold They got his voice it stays with the movie quite well. For most fans of Brad Fiedel's work it includes great music including the Movies theme!!!!! My only complaints are graphics could be a bit more detailed, and the game could be just a little longer. But it's a great game for any fan. Lots of weapons and explosions. Plus it includes a demo of the upcoming Redemption game which is a 3rd person shooter. Awesome game, like the other guy said ""It does Terminator Justice."""
4,terminator rise of the machines,was a fun game the degree of difficulty wasn't high. But the optional demo at the end for the other game was a plus.
1,Do not buy - Worthless,I purchased this kit to test the hardness of water after treatment by the water softener. The water sample was collected and mailed as per directions. Never received results or any other communication from the company.
3,Not the best I've ever seen.,"I've watched a lot of Roasts and honestly I found this one to be more boring than I expected. Maybe I expected too much, but I was disappointed to say the least. 3 stars still because some parts were funny, but I've definitely seen better."
2,Take NoDose before and during watching,"Comedy Central usually has some of the best ""stick"" around. Martin Sheen did remain calm despite the repeated reference to his use of drugs and whores. Shapner did a very good delivery without dipping into the vulgarity that others used to get laughs. I was very disappointed, and you will be to, if you buy it or even rent it."
4,"Good, not great","This product makes for a good entry level Cajon. I haven't quite gotten it tuned to my preferences, but it wasn't far off right out of the box. The sounds are pretty decent. For the price, you can't beat it. I would recommend this as a good entry-level Cajon. Great for camping trips, open mics, jam sessions."
5,LOVE THIS ITEM!,Bought this a long time ago from Amazon and it's still running! LOVE THIS ITEM! I use it for shows all the time. RECOMMEND! Great price also!
5,FINALLY!!,"i have been a bowling for soup fan for a while and have been wanting to see them live ever since i first heard ""a hangover you dont deserve"" but havent been able to catch a single show. im so excited about this dvd! this band is awesome and everyone tells me that their shows are so much fun...now i can see for myself!"
4,Live and well...,BFS is back! Amazing DVD and the guys as funny as always. They are entertaining and their music is just great! You'll really enjoy this!
5,awesome!!!!,"bowling for soup have to be one of the funnest bands i have ever seen, i have seen bfs twice and i am about to see them a 3rd time this year.this dvd perfectly captures the band live.if u wanna see a great band dedicated to thier fans then buy this dvd, it really is awesome :)"
5,Bowling totally rocks on this dvd.,I have to admit I'm not a huge Bowling for Soup fan but I saw a clip of this on youtube and I must say they are really good live. After watching the clip I bought this and it is like the best money ive spent on amazon in a long time. Even if youre not the biggest fan you should deff buy this. This is the best live dvd ive seen in years.
5,IM LOVIN IT!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS DVD IS GREAT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. GREAT MUSIC, NOT MUCH LANGUAGE. JUST YOUR AVERAGE JOE ROCK BAND. I WATCHED AND I WAS UP THE ENTIRE TIME. WTG BOWLING FOR SOUP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,BB King's Gold is Gold,"I absolutely loved this 2 cd set. I especially like the 2nd disc, altho I have played both in the car almost incessantly. Its amazing how tolerable Los Angeles traffic becomes when you are listening to BB's mellow sounds."
2,Haven't been able to get it to work,"I have been looking for a more responsible way to use my 1st-generation Shuffle in the car (driving and headphones are not the best combination), and I was so excited when I found this. However, I have yet to be able to listen to anything on it. The lights work, and my Shuffle works, but no sound comes out. I have tried all possible combinations of the four FM frequencies and the Shuffle settings. Driving home today I got so frustrated I just pulled out my headphones and put them on anyway.I'm willing to keep trying, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Two stars are for the design alone."
1,Poor quality!,"This top looks very nice on the photo but is very poor quality in real life. Its thin and stretches like chewing gum.After two washes the color of the fabric is fading, the thread is breaking and the shape is deforming...Not happy!"
1,Too Complicated,"I found that the CDDB function of my Adaptec Easy CD Creator 4 no longer worked, so I searched for new stuff. This is not it! It scrambles the song order from the orginal music cd to the cd that you are copying to! Tech support said that was problem that they were aware of, but would fix in the future. I have yet to figure out how to make a Jewel case label that is advertised as a possibility. The radio buttons are ""cute"" but not functional. I had a difficult time even l;earning how to copy data to a CD. I wasted my money. I am searching for new software now."
1,MusicMatch support sucks,I bought 15 tracks 6 days ago and was only successful downloading 7 of them. My MusicMatch program thinks it was successful but there are cryptic file fragments in My Music Folder under the Artist's album for the remaining 8 tracks. I've been going back and forth with Tech Support via email (the only way) which takes 1-2 days for them to respond and they keep telling me how the tracks have been successfully downloaded but in essense their not. You can rest assure though that I will find the charges on my credit card. I would find another service.
2,Too cumbersome and time consuming,"I bought jukebox looking for a program that was simple to use and would let me burn and run...this is NOT that program. It has these music libraries that it relies on for organization, doesn't let you import other music playlists...it lacks features too. Hardly worth the money. My recommedation: move on and keep looking."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"MUSIC MATCH BOX HAS A NICE INTERFACE, AND IS EASY TO USE (TO PLAY CDS AND MP3'S), HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BURNING MUSCIC CDS THERE IS NO SUPPORT NUMBER ,NO FORUM TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS. YOU EMAIL THEM AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT 48 HOURS OR MORE FOR A RESPONDS OR NO RESPONDS AT ALL."
3,Don't even think about asking for Tech Support,"Feature for feature, this is an excellent product. And if it installs properly and works smoothly for you, you'll be very happy with it. But if you ever need technical support, you'll find yourself very frustrated. MusicMatch claims to respond to support requests from paying customers within 72 hours. But the reality is that you could wait a month or more for a response from their tech support team."
2,Disappointed and Dissatisfied with your product !....,"I think that it is only fair that I send you this email. In the past I have used many different CD burning ROM software's including,Nero, easy CD creator etc. Unfortunately I would have to say that the music match jukebox CD burner is by far the most difficult and the most complicated I've ever used. One reason why I say this is because on all other softwares they have icons to guide you through just about everything. The music match jukebox is very poorly laid out. No icons, no guidance what so ever. There are several things I don't like including, sometimes my recordings come out slightly distorted and for some reason when I'm recording from a music folder the software constantly wants to go on line. I'm sad to say that I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with your product !"
1,JUST TERRIBLE !!!!!,"I have a Dell xps with 1024 ram, windows XP pro and 120 GB. I installed musicmatch and it immediately disable my Nec 1100a DVD/CD read and write drive. I tried to enable the driver through my ""Device Manager"" (which showed the drive disable), and when I tried to I got error message that there was a program conflict and windows could not enable the drive. I sent a e-mail to tech support SIX days ago and still have not heard back.The only other product I have that uses the drive is Roxio 7.I have uninstalled musicmatch and used the windows ""restore"" to get my computer back to where it should be with my NEC 1100a DvD/CD--R/RW drive working just fine.My advice is to stay away from this product because of conflicts that may arise with other programs and the piss-poor tech support !!!!!!"
4,feel the energy !,"just saw these guys at the doheny blues festival. never heard of them before then. what a great band they were to watch and listen to. they rock the the blues! if the disk is anything like what i heard, you'll be shakin' you butts like all the people were at the festival. i only gave this four stars because a haven't heard the disk. i'm basing this only on what i heard live."
1,StaiNo Tooth Stain Eraser,"The eraser crumbled while using it, and left pieces of gray on my teeth. I do not recommend this product. There was a very small amount of stain removed."
2,didnt work,"didnt work i dont want to write 18 more words, this is why I normally dont review. This is ridiculous"
3,Not impressed!,Such a waste of my time and money! Not at all what I expected. I had rather go to dentist than use these! Bad choice.
1,Does not work as promised,You are better off getting sand paper and putting it on your teeth; That is basically what this is.Not recommended.
5,shine linke a star.,My wife had tea stains on her teeth. This is great stuff anytime and you could skip the dentist for another time.
4,Have had since October 2005,"After remodeling our house with structured wiring and CAT-6 cable, I ordered one of these back in October of 2005 and installed it shortly after that. As others have mentioned, the fans are pretty loud, but in a corporate/IT environment its not a big deal and we like the hum of fans. :) At home, my switch is in a wiring closet and produces a light background sound that isn't obtrusive, but I wouldn't want it next to me. One of the fans started going out a few months ago and I'm going to get some replacements which will probably be quieter. Otherwise, no problems. I believe units sold after May 2007 have a life-time warranty and I see new units heavily discounted at some websites."
1,"Bad Build Quality, worse service","I purchased this two years back, since then it has gone bad multiple times. First thing that goes bad is the fan. It becomes noisy. Then it becomes intermittent. Netgear will replace it with a rebuilt one (after you pay for S&H), which also goes bad. It has a two year warranty, as soon as the two years are up, Netgear support says sorry, you have to buy a new one. Can't say that I received a bad piece because multiple copies had similar problems. Not reliable."
5,Awsome unmanaged switch,"This switch is an affordable rack mounted solution, providing 10/100/1000 speeds and is un-managed, has power saving features and bright link and activity lights."
3,Very LOUD fan,This network switch works great but the fan is very loud. I have it installed in a media panel in a wall. I can hear the fan running in the room on the other side of the wall. I wish there was a way to slow down the fan speed when optimal cooling isn't required. I would not buy another one of these just because of the fan noise. Good luck on your puchase.
4,low cost jumbo frame support,"Good performance switch with Jumbo frame support and low hassle install. Moved up to Gigabit after my ancient FS108 switch died. More computers, more drops in the house, and Gigabit standard on our macs & music server made this a good choice.I have yet to do hard-core performance tests, but will add/update this review when I do, so 4 stars for now."
4,Excellent,"May be a boring book to some, but to those interested in the power of prayer, it should required reading."
4,"Short, but challenging.","I ordered this book at the same time as the larger Reese Howells: Intercessor, but I read this one first. It tells some stories from a bit of a different perspective, but in general is sort of an abridged version of his life. Some of Reese's teachings have been included to help give a better understanding of what intercession meant to him, and I found there were several points that challenged and encouraged me."
5,This book gets at the root of hateful speech!,"What is the real problem with hate speech? It is the heart, and faultythinking that springs from the heart. I recommend this book as a helpful read."
1,great for future housewives and for conformist views,"my mom gave me this book when I was about 12, even at the time I really did give the book much more then a glance. A few months ago I looked back on the book and basically it enourages girls to center their lives around guys, clothes, and christ. I'm sorry when I have a daughter I do not and would not want her to read a book like this that enourages girls to basically be a stereotype of looking pretty, being obedient to men, etc. I want to enourage pride, cutiousity, intelligence, and strength and not breed the next generation of housewives or the wives and mothers of important men. I also do not appreciate the author's ""view"" on homosexuality. I do not enoucourage homophobia or intolerance either."
1,I would never give this book to a Christian teen!,"This book advocates the very things that Christian parents should be teaching against. Dating, flirting, etc."
5,Very Good and Comprehensive,"There's a sea of girl's books out there, and I'm determined to weed through each. Katie Meier's book has a long title, and surprisingly covers a lot - spirituality, body image, peer pressure, and more. Very similar to most non-fiction girl's books, Meier gives the advice in a big sister way. What separates this book from others? It actually goes into scripture and is not afraid to be frank about religion, as well. That in itself, unlike a lot of girl's non-fiction books which shy away from one of the most important aspect in a girl's life (their emotional and spiritual side), makes this book true to itself and 5 stars. Other girls books that do not shy away from being true - the Gifted Girls Series and the Gutsy Girls books."
2,Label Misrepresents Product,"The title of this CD is ""The Nelson Touch: 25 Big Band Hits 1931-1941."" During the period from 1930-1940, Ozzie Nelson's band charted 25 ""Billboard"" hits. The first 19 were on Brunswick and the last 19 on Bluebird. The disk contains selections from both labels.I don't know what criterion the manufacturers use to determine what is or is not a hit, but in checking Joel Whitburn's ""Pop Memories:1890 to 1954"" I find that only seven songs in this compilation made ""Billboard's"" top 40."
4,Almost perfect,"This loaf pan makes beautiful bread, but the bottom is a bit narrow and widens toward the top at a greater angle than other loaf pans, so the bread is not shaped as nicely as it could be for sandwiches. I like the wide lip which keeps the edges of the bread from over browning or burning. My only complaint - and it is a small complaint - is the narrowness of the bottom and the wider angle of opening to the top of the pan. I purchased Pampered Chef unglazed stoneware loaf pans and they are slightly superior for bread making."
2,poor quality,"One of the reasons this set appealed to me is the box, I am a neat freak and my tools are all kept clean and organized on the truck.Tried these bits twice so far and found them to be of "" Fair quality""Blade tip is very rough. BOX BROKE THE FIRST DAY. Box hinges are made of extruded plastic and is very thin and brittle."
4,capable and quick,"i used the 3/4"" drill for drilling through two pieces of wood that were sandwiched together for a total width of about 2.5 inches. i used a dewalt 18v on the low speed/high torque setting and it didn't have much trouble getting through the wood. the self-feed really does do the work for you, much better than the regular spade bits.update: if i could i would rate this as a 5 star product. it goes through everything i've put it up against. vertical grain fir, old growth wood, etc. it just burns right through. awesome for running wires, plumbing, etc."
4,Great bit,I was surprised at how clean the holes were. The bit requires no help at all. In fact I had to learn that I needed to stop the drill or the bit just kept going when I was drilling recessed holes for lag bolts.
2,not worth it,"These bits seem like a good but they were terrible. 12v, 18v and corded 1/2"" drill and they could barely get through 3/4"" plywood without jamming up."
3,Bosch Litheon PS20 not powerful enough.,I bought these drills for use with the Bosch litheon PS20 cordless drill.The bits seem to be of high quality. The self feeding feature pulls the cutting face into the work much too fast for the Bosch to handle. It stalls out even with a fresh charge. They would probably be good for a corded or more (much it would seem) powerful cordless.
1,Review,"My advice to you is that unless you have a very large and powerful drill you DO NOT buy this set. The problem is with the four larger sizes. They grab too much wood and literally stops the drill, and I am talking about DeWalt and Makita ELECTRIC 1/2 inch drills here. After you start the hole it will lock immediately, even if you back off for a split second until the drill achieves full RPM's again, and then ever so gently try to easy your way into the wood, no good, and I was working with regular redwood.My advice is you buy DeWalt better quality bits that will last you for very long time and will not loose their sharpeness, AND you can ease your way into the wood without ever locking.I thought these ""speedbor"" bits would be a great addition to my tools but in reality they just frustrated me.One last detail (I really don't like these ones, can you tell?): If you are lucky enough to cut a hole, it will have a very rough surface."
4,Very Nice,"These drills do a nice job. I use them for rough-in work, running pipes and wires and not really for fine, detailed work. They don't really work the greatest with my 18 volt battery drill because the threaded screw feeder tip is a little aggressive and draws the bit in too quickly causing the drill to bog down in dense woods. Works pretty good with my 3/8"" electric drill though and even better with my heavy duty 1/2"" Milwaukee ""Hole Hog"" drill, which has a slower speed and higher torque. Cuts through quickly and cleanly. Watch out for nails though. They are not carbide and nails will destroy the cutting edge. CAUTION: These bits are not for use on a drill press."
3,Good stuff,"I am a commercial electrician. So I know a few things about using these bits. They are pretty good. Its nice that they come with a 1-1/4"" bit. I have been using these for about a month now. Only complaint is that that the 1-1/4"" is starting to dull. Granted its still sharp, but it could be sharper since its still so new.Update 12/12/12All of the bits either have completely rounded off shoulders and/or the shanks have bent. Granted the shank problem could be my fault, I think they are just able to stay straight when hitting nails or screws."
5,Best drill bits for making holes in studs,i do electrical work and i drill lots of holes and these are hands down the best bits. Because of the screw tip once that catches you have to put no amount of pressure on your drill. I am very impressed with these bits. for the price these are a must buy. five out of five!
3,Okay regular moisturizer,"This is not a perfect miracle moisturizer. I used it as a day moisturizer for over a month and for me it was:- a reasonably good-smelling lotion- a slightly oily moisturizer that can feel a bit greasy or leave some shine- good on sensitive skin, or skin recovering from a lot of sun/dryness,- BUT not a good idea for acne-prone skin due to the oilAll in all, it's a nice and fairly cheap moisturizer, but not good for use with acne treatment."
4,pleasant surprise,"I originally bought this product because I needed a few dollars to push me into free shipping and figured it was something worth trying. I have to say i'm very happy with it, my skin always feel great after using it, I'll likely be buying it again after I run out but with tiny amount needed to use this stuff the jar will probably last me a year."
4,Leaves a nice feeling on your skin!,This is a good moisturizer as it is non-irritating and not too greasy. I have sensitive skin that also tends to break out and this product has improved my complexion.
3,Not for super dry skin,"I have super dry skin, this cream works OK in the summer, but it is not enough for winter.Not for dry skin in winter."
1,Almost had my vote,I was reading through the ingredients and was impressed until I seen that it contains paraben which is responsible for cancer. You don't need to use parabens as a preservative there are plenty of safer alternatives out there.
5,Great for sensitive skin!,"I purchased my first jar on special at Whole Foods. It was a great price and a nice sized jar. I've been having issues with dry skin on the skin between my nose and eyes. My old moisturizer was not helping. I've heard great things about Jojoba Oil but it's terribly expensive. So, I was optimistic about this product. I've been using it everyday and it's really nice. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or rosacea and doesn't ""sit"" on top either. It's light but very moisturizing. My skin has been looking wonderful and I know it's because of this product. Highly recommend!"
4,amazing,"i love this truly, all-natural moisturizer. i normally make my own but have stopped because this is so nice. doesn't leave you oily or feeling weighed down. I highly recommend it."
3,Like any other moisturizer,"Like I said, this moisturizer is like any other moisturizer - it's creamy and it moisturizes. I'm not really that satisfied with it, but I think that's because I don't use it much. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it has aloe vera and jojobo oil in it and it's organic/vegan, but I didn't give this product a 5/5 because it's just an ordinary moisturizer, it doesn't really do anything."
2,You get what you paid for.,"Another high expectations, and high disappointment. Yes, that`s great cream for 4 dollars, and if you have an oily skin, because it doesn`t really moisturize. I have a combination skin, but after washing it gets tight. This cream sinks after a while in the skin, but I have the same feeling of dry skin later. It has no glide.Now I use it for the body, after adding few drops or aromatherapy oils. I won`t purchase again."
2,Thick & oily,"I did not like the texture of this moisturizer. It is thick and does not rub in well, leaving a whiter look to my face (although this gradually goes away). I also felt it left my skin unusually oily and increased my acne. Price too good to be true..."
1,Quality control?,I don't know if there was something wrong with the one I bought but it turned my face red and burned like heck on my arms and legs where ever I had a small scratch. I took it back.
2,gave me rash and smells really bad,"I ordered this product because I wanted an organic moisturizing cream. Firstly the cream smelled really weird, bad weird. But I thought I can bear the smell if it is good on my skin. Unfortunately the moment I put it on my face I got really bad rash. But I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and the next day I used it on one half of my face with the same result. Half of my face turned red with rush... will not use it again"
5,Ticktock & Jim - A Wonderful Story,I first read this book when I was 11. I am now 56 and am looking to replace my original copy because I loved the story so much.It is a wonderful story about an adolescent boy living on a farm who buys a horse from a horse trader for his grandfather's pocket watch. The story is about their adventures together. This is a wonderful book for adolescents who love horses and animals. The illustrations are by Wesley Dennis who illustrated the Marguerite Henry books.A great read for anyone who loves horses
2,Memorable only for Jaco,"Randy Bernsen was awfully lucky to have known Jaco well enough to have recorded a few tunes with him. And they are a FEW tunes. The standout on this record (responsible for both of the stars up there) is Olde Hats, a romping big band number featuring Peter Erskine, Bobby Thomas and Othello Molineaux, plus the University of Miami Big Band.. and oh yeah, Randy Bernsen. Its sound is straight from the Word of Mouth Big Band, and Jaco is prominent. I think this one song is the only reason to own the album. The other song Jaco plays on is Windsong, an instrumental with a female woo-woo vocal that just gets more annoying as the precious seconds pass. The rest of the album, not worth the time."
3,These drops don't have much of a taste,These drops go a long way. I put a couple of drops in my clear drinking water and the water has a very mild taste to it. It's okay.
5,Outstanding,"Well written mystery that will appeal to all mystery fans, especially those who are book collectors."
5,GREAT!,This game is great and I mean great. There is so much that you can do. If you are fan of the Terminator series then I highly suggest that you go purchase this game!
3,Pretty easy to defeat,"This game is fun, with tons of awesome guns, but a total of about 15 hours was all it took me to do the 23 missions in this game, and I am NOT a great video game player. My advice is to play SOCOM II - tons better value for the money! Probably why T3 was $50 before Christmas, and is already down to $20."
3,Could have been better if...,"it was in the ""third person"" rather than ""first"". The game is challenging and it helps having a map to know where you are going otherwise you would be stuck wandering directionless like in Blade 2 the game. The story doesn't follow the path of the movie, but to hear Arnold's voice was cool. I did enjoy blowing everything up.Like I said, this game is not in ""third person"" and that is why I am giving it 3 stars."
2,"Boring, Hard To Control And Way Too Easy!","This game is dark, dank, gritty and boring! The controls are extremely hard to master because you have to use both of the analog sticks to walk and turn and aim all at the same time. The graphics are cool and so are the actor's voice overs, but that's the only redeeming uality about this lame-fest! Don't buy this waste of $50, wait for the next one to come out, that game is going to rock!"
2,Not worth it,"Basically, this game's not worth anyone's money. I bought this game thinking it would be pretty good, but boy was I surprised. This game has ok graphics, terrible gameplay, and no story at all. I wish this game was never made because it made Atari look stupid. The only upside about it is that it has a Terminator liscence, which is always cool(except this time)."
2,NOT THAT GOOD,THE ONLY REASON THIS GAME GETS 2STARS ITS ALL BECAUSE OFF ARONLD SCHWARZENEGGER THEY MADE HIM LOOK AMAZING AND IS VOICE SOUNDS GREAT.BESIDES THAT THIS GAME IS TERMINATED GAME OVER.
2,NOT THAT GOOD,THE ONLY REASON THIS GAME GETS 2STARS BECAUSE OFF ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER LOOKS GREAT SOUNDS GREAT. BESIDES THAT THIS GAME SHOULD BE CALLED RISE OFF THE CRAP.
2,Can Not See,Game need to have a whole body view of the user character. Need a better map ofwhere the character is going. To many enemies as targets. Makes it to difficultto use weapons.
3,Review quickie T3 on PS2,If you haven't read my Terminator 3 movie review go look for my reviews in my profile. Terminator 3 the movie I don't like that much however I do like the game especially going through the 2032 levels there is a small problem the AI is usually pretty easy to take down it does hurt the game a little bit I know every mainstream reviewer gave it's a negative review but you see I'm not a mainstream reviewer I'm the kind of guy who will defend Robocop3 Alien 3 Alien Resurrection Escape from LA & Mortal Kombat Anhiliation. As in my T3 movie review I do go negative but I point out what I loved about the movie. Now this game isn't the best PS2 X BOX title h** no not even the best Terminator game the good Terminator games are The Terminator on Sega CD Terminator & Terminator 2 the arcade game & if the game gives you any trouble there is cheats for it it's not great but I do like it. It's ok.
4,wish i could get all the terminators in one pack,"well they got t1 on playstation and t3 wish t2 was on ps1 or 2 hope they release t4 on ps2 all good if you are a terminator fan, would be nice if they combined them like the mortal combat game."
2,Aight Cut,while this Year thus far has Been R.Kelly's in terms of Him Writing&producing the Tightest Jams on Others&also on Himself this Cut is alright at best.having Puffy fluffy on it though isn't something that i look toward hearing.but the track itself fits B2K.
3,Great Song...,"""Bump, Bump, Bump"" By B2K ft. P. Diddy is a great song but P. Diddy should have just minded his own business and watched B2K do their thing. I would have liked it better if Lil' Fizz wrote and performed his own rap; performing his own rap would have given the song a little something extra. The song would have sounded newer and fresher and would have given me a better chance to know the members of B2K if P. Diddy wasn't in it.Otherwise, this song is da bomb and I love listening to it and dancing when it's on. The R and B beat really gets me moving and singing along.If you like B2K, them be sure to check out P. Diddy's newest boy group, B5. Although they are signed to P. Diddy's record label, Bad Boy Entertainment, P. Diddy doesn't leave his damaging fingerprints all over their songs like he did on Bump, Bump, Bump. B5 has great beats, and if you like B2K, then you'll probably like B5.Leah Star Age:16"
2,The song's alright but....,"It is alright, but I hate P Diddy. He's everywhere, and it annoys me!B2K by themselves doing this song would have been WAY better, but of course, Pee Diddy (hehe) had to intervene.This song is now stuck in my head and will not go away! This must be a good thing, right?Overall, an alright song but the intrusion of P Diddy made me turn off this song."
5,Rozen Maiden the final battle . . .,"Episodes 11 and 12 of Rozen Maiden Traumend:The Alice Game are some of the best episodes in Rozen Maiden history!!There is so much sadness in it . . .For you Suigentou fans . . . she died again!!!!I would recommend Rozen Maiden to anyone who likes a good Anime that's funny,sad,and action packed!!!!"
5,Great for Learning and as a teaching Aide,This is probably one of my favorite books. It has a way of teaching the essence of Tai Chi movement into a way that Western minded people can grasp. Start with the ball and get a jump on Tai Chi principles. Jimmie
5,Highly Recommended,Highly recommended for any serious martial artist. Dr. Yang does it again. Excellent instruction and very insightfull.
3,Unique love story,"It's a unique twist: faced with a clone and a human, Areia takes neither and goes for an alien! She was a spaceship commander, and then she turns into a priest's assistant!This is certainly a story I think female sci-fi readers would appreciate (thus revealing me as male, he he), since its main topic is the romance between M'landan and Areia. But it's a romance alive with conflict and uncertainty. A true test for the non-human priest and his human lover."
2,Not for the exam - good referance manual,"This book has to much information to be read for the exam. Even the disk, that has questions from mastertest, is incorrect on questions. Sometimes the answers from the reference on the cd do not match the answer given. The test will say incorrect when your answer was correct."
1,Really Disappointed!!,"Two careless with the example, also too many contradictions, lack of professional and accurate knowledge.Totally a disappointed!!"
5,Passed with flying colours!,Hats off to McGraw and the author for providing a spirited overview of Solaris certification. I've just passed my exam after years of procrastination - I found the sections on LDAP and IPv6 most useful for an old timer such as myself. You can teach an old *NIX dog new tricks after all. No printing coverage though - but a friend tells me the Solaris 8 book did cover it?
5,I passed!!!,"I just came from passing the Solaris 9 system administrator certification exam. Without this book, I would have been completely lost. It covers all of the material that I took in one of my training courses, and I use it every day at work as a reference book. The best chapter was on NTP - I had no clue you could do so much with time!"
4,Great book,"I bought this book and the Tim Gibbs book. Both are very good certification books with many, many test questions. Of course these authors are not going to reprint the exact test questions - that would be against copyright. ..."
4,Great book,"I just bought two books in the All-In-One series - this one and the CISSP book - and they are just great. This one covers most of the topics in good detail for the sysadmin and net admin exams. I didn't give it 5 stars because I would have liked a bigger section for net admin. But the new exams have been ""dumbed down"" so much that maybe it's OK.And before any M$ bigots jump in with more trashy comments on UNIX - save your breath for the .NET server release (I'm still holding)."
1,Not for beginners and inaccurate,"This book is definitely not for beginners, and has many inaccuracies throughout. I have personally found numberous facts throughout the book that I have proven wrong on many levels and by many people. If you are looking for a refresher about the Solaris OS, then by all means read away. However, if you are looking to study for and pass the certification tests, then look elsewhere. Also, the book covers many topics that have no relevance to the tests themselves. Such as....1) LDAP is not a network admin. cert. topic it is a system admin. cert. topic2) ATM is not anywhere in the Sun objectives or test3) 10BASE2 is 10Mbps not 2Mbpsand the list goes on and on......."
1,Disappointing,The book was very disappointing from a testing point of view.For example the book did not cover printing which is on the first test.I also found a lot of typos.But most disappointing was the errors-misprints in the test exams which is a huge no-no.I also went to thier website and found no errata for the book.Very bad !!
1,Riddled with mistakes and inaccuracies,"The book may be helpful for knowledgeable people looking for a refresher and practice tests, but those looking for a helpful study guide will fail miserably. There text is rife with context errors and just plain wrong information. If you do get it, make sure you read the actual manual pages for the commands he covers, because the parts that claim you need to know this information for the exam, half the time the information is wrong."
1,AGBNY,If you use this book to study for the second Sun Solaris Certified Administrators exam you are likely to fail the exam. I used this book instead of exam cram and the book did not cover the majority of the questions that I saw on the exam.This book is simply a waste of money. Buy exam cram if you require concise and accurate treatment of the part 2 exam topics. I learned my lesson the hard way.Do not purchase this book if you are serious about passing exams on the first try.THis is a very inferior product!!!
2,Not an exam study guide,"If you're looking for a book to help you study for the exam, skip this book. It covers topics not on the exam, and doesn't cover topics that are on the exam. However, if you want to set up an e-commerce server, or a web server, then this is the book to purchase. Usually, you get a CD with an exam prep book. This CD is a verbatim copy of the questions at the end of each chapter, so the CD is worthless, in my estimation. If you want to study for the exam, buy the Exam Cram, and maybe the Syngress certification book. Also, buy a good exam practice test. I found this book to be not helpful for exam study at all. But, if you want to setup a webserver, this book is good. Lots of errors, too, so double check your facts before you deploy."
5,I love the gold retriever,The gold retrievers is one of my favorite movies. My mom didn't like it but I did. I was scared when the skeleton went up into the girl's face.
1,Is the author as confused as me?,"Reading this book, I feel like the author doesn't quite understand what he is trying to say. Certain sections of the book make me feel as though it is a rough draft of some student's research paper. The way he goes back and forth in such an informal manner annoys me. I have read much better books within this subject matter and suggest steering clear of this one if at all possible."
5,the eddy duchin story on cd,"excellent sound quality , I bought this cd because my mother loved the film and this is a reminder of her"
1,Dissappointed!!!,I thought that the music which I would get was the music from the Eddie Duchin (story) movie. It was not!!!
5,The perfect small country,"This DVD is perfect if you are thinking of visiting Britain. Wales is the original Celtic homeland - not many people realize that before English became the dominant language, an early form of Welsh was spoken across the British isles and this language is still spoken in parts of Wales today. Apart from the language, Wales offers visitors a host of reasons to visit from 1000 year old castles to modern theme parks for the whole family. With beautiful beaches and coastline and some spectacular mountain areas all within a few hours of each other there will be something for everyone in Wales! Highly recommended..."
2,Birder's Guide to Texas,"Book gave good sites to go to, but I was hoping for illustrations of birds.Informative as far as description of what birds you can see at what areas."
2,Speaker Reveiw,These speakers hold up well but the sound quality is absoulutely terrible i would not buy these if you are looking for loud speakers
2,A Tale of a Stupid Man,"I have enjoyed David Lindsey's novels, but this one was a big disappointment. I firmly believed it should be renamed ""A Tale of a Stupid Man"". I came away with the impression that the main character, Ross Marteau, thought more with his male sex organ than with his brain, and this led him to an inglorious (and probably well-deserved) end."
1,Mistake,"I dont believe that I actually finished this book. Book is boring, plot is nonsense, and how anybody actually enjoyed this book is beyond me."
1,Just a terrible book,"I can't believe how lousy,sloppy and improbable this book is. David Lindsey,who brought us the complex,facsinating Stuart Heydon,has apparently decided that he doesn't need him anymore and has been trying to compete with Robert Ludlum for improbable and sophomoric writing. The characters are nothing more than cartoon characters,the plot is artificially convoluted,lacking any focus and credibilty. The dialogues are so forced,ridiculous and childish,I felt embarrassed for the author. I figured out the culprit midway through the book,so it didn't even hold any suspense,forced and artificial as it was. It's is amazing that such a promising author has sunk so low."
3,Not as Good as Usual,"David L. Lindsey apparently doesn't need Houston detective Stuart Haydon, but I do. In Haydon Lindsey created one of the most complex, contradictory characters in the genre. Then he abandoned him.ANIMOSITY is a well-written novel (David Lindsey writes beautiful prose), but it left me wondering what exactly was the point. The characters were not very likeable and nothing was what it seemed. The plot was painfully convoluted and tended to twist and turn upon itself like a snake hit by a car. The conclusion was very unsatisfactory.I gave the book three stars because any David Lindsey book is worth at least that, but I don't think that I will recommend it."
1,What a disappointment!,"I can only reiterate what others have already stated. I have read everything that David Lindsay has written with the utmost admiration. In ""Animosity"" he is too cute and too sloppy. I never thought that Lindsay would challenge my credulity this crassly. His primary character is hardly believable in his naivete."
3,Wonderful Read,"A wonderful read, but to short. The plot is intense and complicated, just like all of David's novels. However, in this one just as you are learning to love the characters, the plot thickens and runs hell-bent-for-leather to it's conclusion.Add 200 more pages to the story line (suggest after the murder) and I would have rated it five stars. But hell, three stars is worth the price of the book."
3,"beautiful writing, unfortunate story","David L. Lindsey's writing in this book is fabulous: peaceful, detailed, lyrical. I thoroughly enjoyed the pace and the way Lindsey puts words together to convey descriptions and ideas. The actual story, however, left me cold. Another reviewer mentioned that the protagonist is passive. Worse, he's gullible and apparently completely unable to think for himself. Other characters repeatedly lie to him and he believes every outrageous thing he's told with very little questioning. I'm not sorry I read the book, but I did leave it in a hotel room - it's not a book I'd add to my collection."
1,Disappointed,"Like several of the other reviewers, I have always loved Lindsey's novels and I was very excited to see he had released a new one. This one is not like any of his others. By the time anything interesting happened, I was so fed up with the ridiculous characters that I could barely force myself to finish the book. For the most part, the book consisted of rehashing the feelings of the characters for each other over and over, with no action or suspense."
1,Animosity,"My first mistake was buying this book; the second was to finish it after reading halfway through. I've always enjoyed Lindsey's books and have looked forward to his latest, however, this is the worst book I've read in a long time. What a disappointment! Does he have a ghost writer?"
5,"Great book, children love to tell you the next line!","My 5 year old grandson who cannot read yet, fell in love with this book. I wish I could find a copy to buy for him or even to check out at the library. The copy we saw belongs to his great-aunt and she is not parting with it!"
4,generally on target,This book by Medved is a solid critique of Hollywood and how many of its movies undermine traditional values concerning sex marriage religion and other subjects. I disagree with some of his opinions; I felt Silence of the Lambs was a very good movie because of the acting and tsome of the writing especially in the confrontations between Lecter and Clarice Starling. The book is well written and well argued in most of its pages and I strongly recommend it.
2,A confusion of content with subject,"The biggest criticism I give Medved is that he confuses the content in popular entertainment with the subject: particularly with movies. Content is what you see in the movie. Subject is what the film is trying to tell you. When you can't tell the difference anymore, you get the wrong idea about movies. And that is just one of many criticisms I give Michael Medved after reading this book."
4,Excellent documentation,"Few people discuss the excellent documentation and cold, hard statistics Medved supplies - perhaps because they are irrefutable. And also because it's easier to make subtle charges of racism and bigotry. One reviewer even claimed Medved wants a world where everyone is white and Christian - Medved is Jewish and discusses his religion at length in the book!!! But then, you'd have to actually READ the book to know that...Medved shows beyond the shadow of a doubt that Hollywood is more interested in what it thinks of itself than in anything else - true art or even money.Strange that many of the same movie buffs who decry the dumbing-down of film within the past 15 years suddenly rush to defend Hollywood (even the trash!) in order to avoid agreeing with Medved.An excellent book - an excellent tool for analyzing American culture."
4,Well worth a look,"Medved, does nothing else here other that at least raise some important questions. A fine writer, with an excellent command of the language, Medved confronts (at least in his thesis) Hollywood's blatant disregard for traditional American values.Yes, Medved's thesis is simplistic and yes, he fails to consider the changing times which are indeed reflected in popular culture. And No, I as a reader certainly do not agree with all of Medved's points (Platoon is a far, far superior film to The Sands of Iwo Jima!). And I don't think everyone is supposed to agree with every point Medved desires to make. However, he does pose serious deconstructive questions that lend themselves well toward serious discourse and debate.Popular Culture has now evolved to significance in our society, whether for well or ill, well beyond a relfective product. It does influence us as well. Medved is simply, in this book that's well worth a look, asking us to closely consider what that influence may be."
1,The sky is falling! The sky is falling!,"Let me sum up this 350-page rant in a few sentences.1. There's a lot of crappy movies, television, and music getting made. (He's right about this. I actually agree with most of his opinions about specific films, shows, records, etc.)2. Because of this, our jobs, our lives, our very civilization is in dire peril!3. Therefore, we must put an end to all this making of bad movies, tv shows, and music!Michael, I really do like your reviews. But grow up for heaven's sake! It's just entertainment."
1,Healthcare Marketing Plans,Did not receive the book -- arrived damaged at the post office. Account credited. No attempt to re-send.
5,confort is,"I have been a mailman for 28 years, I finally found a shoe thats in my comfort zone.love them."
3,Excessive,"I must agree with another reviewer... all that is required of this book is the first and last chapters.Instead of high-level adventure or life threatening exploits into the mysterious, the reader is best to settle for historical research of past attempts to locate Ecuador's legendary Inca treasure. No Indiana Jones script here.With such an entanglement of characters past and present, along with weak geographical perceptibility due to a map which is certainly difficult to interpret, the discourse turns into muddle.The subject at hand is simply overdone to the point of exhaustion."
4,Thoroughly researched and mostly entertaining....,"First and foremost, this book is more of a literary and investigative adventure. It's not until the last chapter that the author actually details his own physical search for the fabled treasure in Ecuador of the Incan King Atahualpa. A treasure that by all accounts over the last 500 years may be the most valuable land cache of gold and other precious objects on earth. It provides interesting and entertaining background on the other treasure hunters and explorers who went before him on the search. This leads the reader through labrynthine twists of misinformation, questionable documents/maps and several ""characters"" the author encounters who come across as gold-crazed swashbucklers. The book is definitely well-researched, but I expected something more along the lines of an Indiana Jones type of real-life adventure and came away with something more along the lines of a day spent in a musty-smelling library...."
2,Great Concept Falls Flat,"Valverde's Gold is a first-hand experience of author Mark Honigsbaum's chase after a legend of lost Inca gold.The story includes legend, some myth, lost and partial treasure maps, and jungle exploration. Sounds pretty cool, right? Sadly Hongisbaum's journey becomes a confused mess of indistinguishable characters, eventless snippets of his investigation, and ultimately a sadly un-impactful conclusion.This might have been better if turned into fiction or perhaps a shorter story.I'm a very big fan of conquest-era Inca and Spanish, but was disappointed by and uninterested in this book."
1,Rehashing a Well Trodden Path,"This is a book typical of a ""hack"" -- written by a journalist with no real feeling for his topic beyond finding a publisher for his efforts. Honigsbaum's ""search"" is hardly original -- this ground has already been well covered by Peter Lourie (""Sweat of the Sun, Tears of the Moon: A Chronicle of an Incan Treasure"") in a self-deprecating and sympathetic account of his fascinating quest for the location of ""Valverde's Gold"" not written with a book deal in mind."
5,Not your whitewashed history,What many textbooks seem to leave out. Great conversation starter and wonderful when someone close thinks to support various wars.
1,Is there a rating that is less than one star?,"This conspiritological, (Howzat for a word?) paranoid, bigoted spew is being mailed to active Democrats in the Tampa Bay and Orlando areas in Florida. Another of Hughes publications is Truth Triumphant. Again, does Amazon have a rating lower than one star?"
1,"Circular Citations, and Paranoid BS","This has pages of citations, citations to books just like this, that eventually cite each other. Every page is paranoid BS about Jesuits having jewish/communist/governmental/atheist/scientist/etc fronts. WTF!?Not easy to read, short, boring, repetitive. It is only interesting if you already believe this BS.I got this ""book,"" in the mail back in 06. Mailed by some crazy church to everyone in my area. I kept it to show to anyone who asks why I am an atheist."
3,Very small,"This works well in the oven, however this is very small. If you are planning on cooking a casserole in this - this is not the dish for you! This works better as a side dish. I hope that Fiesta will come out with a larger one in the future."
3,"arrived broken, seems nice","I ordered this item and it arrived it two days. I was excited to get home and unpack it. It was packed in a huge box (maybe 10x the actually item size). It was in a box inside a box. When I opened it I realized it was broken. The lid had a crack and chip on the inside and the bowl had a chip on the bottom. The thing that struck me as strange was that there were no pieces in the packaging. So, my guess is that it was broken before it was shipped/packed. I have a feeling that this is a factory second like others have said.I didn't notice the wobbly lid, but I packed it up quickly to return. I didn't think to check if it was wobbly.I am getting a replacement. I do like the size. I thought it would be bigger, but its a nice size for sides.I hope the next one shows up in good shape."
4,Expensive and lid is wobbly.,"This is not my favorite Fiesta piece. The price is more than twice as much as the 2 quart bowl. It is cute and I use it, but I would not purchase it again for the price I paid, which was $50 here on Amazon. At the moment, the cobalt and tangerine ones are $13 less than what I paid, that price seems more reasonable. My lid wobbles pretty badly which I find irritating. Other than the price and wobbly lid, it is a nice piece and I get a good amount of use out of it. It seems hard to find casserole dishes/bowls with lids on them nowadays so I do appreciate this one."
5,Good stuff.,"I already love Fiesta, so it was no surprise that I'd love this too. I've refrained from buying the casseroles for years because I think $50 - $80 is ridiculous. But I bought two used for much less and would never have known they weren't brand new."
4,"Very nice, but smaller than I expected","I love my fiesta, and this was definitely a great addition to my collection! As soon as it arrived, I made my favorite casserole in it - but unfortunately it was just a bit smaller than my other casserole dishes and I couldn't fit everything in.Still, it's a beautiful, very functional piece, and I'm so glad to have it in my collection!"
4,"Great piece, but don't expect it to arrive quickly","I have the tangerine one and I love it -- it's great for using in the microwave to make Rice a Roni and stuff like that. However, my father ordered the Periwinkle one off of my wish list and it kept getting backordered -- for months. We finally cancelled the order and I got something else from my wish list."
3,music purchase (attempted),"It was unfortunate that I never received this item. However, I was not charged for the item(s) not received."
3,Bland,"Three tales comprise the text, only the first of which is especially gripping. The second, an overview of Scott Fischer's '92 ascent of K2, was a poor choice to chronicle. The third, in which the author is the victim, neglects to explain why the accident happened. Overall, the narrative simply lacked the suspense and urgency of good mountaineering literature."
1,Lame,"The author includes his own accident but steers well away from the cause, I wonder why! Its just annoying."
2,"It works, but","This brace works, but it seems to run a little small in size. I measure 42"", and ordered the Large 40"" - 44"". Maybe it is because of the compression that it has to give in order to support what it needs to. It is a struggle to put on by yourself; however, it does seem to do what it claims."
5,It Does Help!,I purchased this brace for my husband to use while he's at works. he does more heavy lifting than he should since he has a torn rotator cuff that is beyond repair. He's used the brace for about a month and he's told me the brace does help him -- he's not in as much pain as he was prior to using the brace. He says he wishes he would have bought it sooner!
2,Check with your Doctor before ordering,Thinking we were doing the right thing by ordering this brace due to rotator cuff surgery for an upcoming ski trip we were surprised when the doctor said to absolutely not wear the brace. We returned the product and were charged a 15% restocking fee by the seller. That was disappointing and costly - be sure to check with your doctor and read the fine print about returns with the seller. The restocking and shipping costs are no fun!!!
3,What you'd expect,"It's an overall satisfying product that gives as much stability as you can hope for at this price. It has a strap to adjust to the arm but the rest is not much adjustable. Having a rather tall torso - the shapes were a little off.But like I said: As good as it gets for the price, I guess."
1,question,"How do I know which size I would need? What measurements do I need to take to determine if I need a Small/Medium/Large or XL?Also, will this work to prevent shoulder dislocations while playing sports? (I have had my shoulder dislocate about 6-7 times while playing basketball)"
1,Broken table,The item arrived with a broken shelf --- the vendor made no effort to send me a good shelf or to replace the table. I AM NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!!
3,Not particularly inspiring,This is the usual Osprey book with the usual text by David Nicolle and the usual artwork by McBride. Definitely not McBride at his best.
2,It's all in your head.,This is the only VanDeWetering book I have not cared for.It really is all in the mind in this one. Disappointing.
3,Not the Real Thing,"When ordering this item from Amazon, I thought I was getting the original soundtrack to this movie. But it was not as I expected; It was the next best thing."
2,Has NOTHING to do with the movie!!!!Not the soundtrack!!!,"WARNING!......This collection IS NOT the soundtrack for the film (which indeed is AMAZING as I have seen it twice).This collection is nothing more than a compilation from Sparrow that claims that it is ""inspired BY the film "" The film was made to help sell this collection.( This disclaimer appears at the end of the film.THIS CAN BE VERY MISLEADING!!!)I am simply writing this to warn people not to purchase the wrong item!The film has it's own soundtrack.I purchased this cd because these are hymns that I have always enjoyed.As collection of beloved hymns alone,though,this is nothing special or amazing at all.All of these tunes have been done ad infinitum and done better than this."
4,Good collection.,Good old-fashioned hymns sung by modern-day artists. I love it. It's great for my morning drive to work to start my day out right.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I HATE TO DISAGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEW. I BOUGHT THE CD BECAUSE I PLAN TO SEE THE MOVIE. I LOVE THE HYMS BUT THE MUSICAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE QUITE DISTRACTING. FAIREST LORD JESUS, A BEAUTIFUL HYMN, SOUNDS LIKE A DANCE NUMBER. PERHAPS I AM JUST GETTING OLD. I DO HOPE EVERYONE SEES THE MOVIE."
3,"AMAZING GRACE, LEAP YEAR AND THE PROMISE","ALL THREE CDS WERE GREAT. ONLY, YOU SENT ME TWO COPIES OF LEAP YEAR AND THE PROMISE. IT CAUSED ME MONEY AND DISAPPOINTMENT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF SENDING THE EXTRA COPIES BACK.JULIANNE WU"
3,Kind of disappointing,"I had received Playground Day! as a Christmas gift for my daughter, so when I found out that Jennifer Merz had another book, I thought it would be as good...I was disappointed. I also think it's funny that one of the selling points noted in the description of the book is that all the pictures are crafted with torn and cut paper and lace with a down-home look, and yet the book is printed in China. Why can't it be printed in the USA?? Maybe that explains the less expensive price compared to some other books...I don't think I would recommend this book."
2,Not too good,"Pretty boring to me. Much of the book is stats to confirm that ESP is not chance. Gets pretty tedious after the 20th reference. Could have been better with all the stats in one chapter (which I could have skipped - or studied if I wished).A few good concepts considered, but the read is much like a college paper rather than an entertaining look at the possibilities that the premise proposes."
3,.,"Sparknotes version: Science be trippin'Too much commentary and not enough substance. Still, worth reading if you don't like reading text books and haven't yet read anything on this subject."
2,Too much statistical data,"The first 100 pages or so of this book are pretty good. They held my attention fairly well. But from then until the end is pretty much an outlandish use of statics and number to validate the ESP/TK/PK phenomenon. I mean these scientists need to look at testing these phenomena at an entirely different way. In this book and elsewhere, scientists repeatedly try to validate something we know very little if anything about, with the primitive testing techniques of our normal world. That's why a lot of their data is inconclusive or finds very little. This book (after the 100th page) did not hold my attention at all. In fact I put it down numerous times and in the end had to force myself to read the rest. Definitely not worth the 14 bucks i spent at Books A Million for it. My advice is if you want to take a chance on it,, wait until it gets to 50 cents and then buy it."
1,Yet Another Delusion,"This is the same kind of neural flatulence that gave us Rhonda Byrnes' ""law of attraction"" in The Secret and Lynn McTaggart's ""Zero Point Field"" in The Field. Dean Radin takes a limited understanding of quantum entanglement and extrapolates it by a hundred orders of magnitude to produce what con artists call The Big Lie, a lie so huge that people assume it must be true simply because of its enormity and daring. And, of course, it is wrapped in the usual authoritative pseudoscience package, complete with totally cool and realistic-looking charts and statistics.History has shown time and again that people can easily persuade themselves to believe anything and then, through an impressive feat of mental onanism, produce what they, and many of their gullible readers, believe to be absolute proof."
3,Courage,"""Those who are frightened of the darkness often refuse to look, and they don't want anyone else to look either.""Look a little bit closer and you will find that there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of. You will need courage but since that is an emotion it is freely available to all."
5,One-Stop Overview of PSI,"Takes reader through over 100 years or PSI research. Reveals how difficult this work is to do, and why it should not be easily dismissed. I interviewed Dr. Radin on my Skeptiko Podcast. He was a great guest."
4,Tour D'Force in the science for PSI.,"I found this a very good read, albiet a little ""Heady"" on statistics it was a fascinating read. I was never aware of the lengthy studies that have been done on PSI, and the continued studies showing it exists. This book made me aware of what I already knew existed, and wondered if science was either ignorant or complacent in ignoring it. Through this book, I discovered they were both.I firmly believe there is a global consciousness, and definitely believe in telepathy as I use it often with people I am entangled with. This book just affirms what I already know, stacks up the evidence in favor of PSI, and shows that science really needs a wake up call to reality."
4,Nobody does it like Harold Budd,"I have several cd's by Mr. Budd. I read that he is retiring soon. He has certainly done a lot of excellent work. This is another example of how good this guy is. I would call this space/piano music. It is hauntingly beautiful and starkly simple. It very well performed. This one is piano and synthesizer. Sometimes just the synthesizer. Although I prefer his collaborations with the guitar players like Robin Guthrie or Bill Nelson I still love the simple piano style on some of his other projects. It is quiet music. It asks to be heard, it doesn't demand to be heard. I can appreciate that."
4,"Very good CD, for quiet monments","I use to have this in a tape; however I finally wore it out, so that kind of gives you a clue of what I think of the CD. LOVE IT!!!!!!! Would love to know where it a new CD of this???"
4,Patent leather Red Belt,Good price and decent quality. It is a little wider than you can tell on image. It is about 3 inches wide. Still a great purchase if you want a red accent for an outfit!
3,high-waisted belts at beltiscool.com,This was my second order from this company.The belts are lovely but the sizeing was not too good as far as I was concerned.The M/L was to long for me and the S/M a bit to short although it fitted better. I had to use the last hole. Living in Britain it was not cost effective for me to return the M/L I first ordered. It would be helpful if the belts had detachable lopes.
3,Leather Belt,"The belt didn't fit me well and I sent it back. It was too tight. I would recommend that you order one size bigger than you really are, since the belt size runs small. The owner is very nice and made this an easy transaction."
1,not happy with it :(,"Okay so I wanted that really fashionably chic look with this thick, glossy belt and was preety excited when I got it on but even tho I got the smallest one its still preety loose to the point it doesnt enhance my waist but rather makes me look chunky in that area and im a fit person! somehow when I put it on I feel uncomfortable, like if it wasn't designed for normal people only to look preety on display...or maybe all wide belts have that quality...I dunno. I plan on heating something to punch one extra hole in it lol, lets see how that turns out since i dont want to deal with returns! and hopefully use it at least once outside of my home."
3,Too Wide!,"I should have used a tape measure, made a prototype of belt and tried it first. I have worn it several times and it bothers me when I sit down."
2,MEH...,"Its ok. i dont hate it. i have a short torso so it looks really big on me, its more rectangle. if you are tall and skinny it will look really great on you. im hippy so it just made me look more hippy. lol its a nice belt though."
5,Black Patent belt,"wonderful, fast delivery and is exactly what I wanted, I am very tiny and it is difficult for me to find this type of product to fit."
3,The size is not right,"The look of the belt is exactly what I wanted, a very cute accessory. However, I bought the S/M and it was far too big. My suggestion is to be aware that the belt runs large."
5,Trak List:,1. Everyone Within Me 3:092. Sonshine 3:273. Letting Go 4:034. Run For The Gold 4:015. Mystery Of The Season 4:566. Between The Two Of Them 3:307. To The Altar 4:438. Survivor 3:039. My Daughter's Friend 4:0810. These Last Days 3:56
5,Signature Sound,This is by far their most energetic video yet. I wish I had half their energy. They pour their heart and soul into their singing.
3,Wrong choice on Christmas,"It's a pity, acquired at a last year Christmas sale in the US, this made-in-Denmark box concludes just one disk ""Extras"", no feature advertised on a jacket, as realized after ripping the plastic wrap on this Christmas in Australia.As understood, it is a very vibrant anime and a lack of what was paid for inside upset me really.Well, so far everything is going wrong this fall."
4,Good but Old,"The use of ""dyes"" to photograph living cells in high detail has made this book outdated. None the less, it is a great starting point to look at body cell composition."
4,wicked +,"The second I pressed play on this cd I was assaulted with a huge battalion of sound. This (to me) is a sign of a cd I'm goin to listen to for a while. While I do agree with some people when they say that the drums are quite weak most of the time and the vocals leave much to be desired, the important thing is that this cd may very well make your nana explode if played loud enough"
4,Great CD,"Oh man! These guys are great. If you're a fan of 70's hard rock this will kick your butt. Great beat, GIANT, amazing guitar solos (without being overtechnical or cheesy), and great riffs. Big arena sized rock. This is just old school, good time rock and roll. The even throw in an organ for back up at times. Yes, remember when rock and roll was fun? The only thing that took time to get used to, and sets it apart from most 70's rock, is the singer's voice. Very high pitched and he likes to shriek and howl his lyrics a lot. But it works for this band. Once you get past that it will all come together. Kind of makes you realize why you started rocking out in the first place."
1,Wanted: New Vocalist for Decent Backing Band,The worst vocals I've ever heard. Makes Yoko Ono look like a songbird. Hire someone who can sing dudes!
5,Moved Without Even Reading the Whole Book,"Kim, I am so moved by the first few pages I've read. My mother, too, died suddenly and young (55). I feel I am living the legacy she left behind. Thanks for this powerful vision of self-discovery through loss. I am buying this book.I would also be open to producing the audio version of this book as I'm an audio producer for major publishing companies. I think ""hearing"" it would be so inspiring. Thank you."
4,Very nice,"I originally bought this book as a gift for my sister, but read it myself before I gave it to her. It's wonderful and enlightening. It just makes you realize that when you love yourself more, life is more enjoyable."
1,What a nightmare--,"This machine literally started falling apart as I was using it! It made my quest for handmade pasta a living hell. 2 out of 4 screws holding the roller mechanism to the base were rattling around inside the machine with no hope of retrieval, the rollers kept opening up thereby not holding the setting, and the cap to the dial kept falling off. I really wanted to give this item a negative star count, but that wasn't an option.As good as homemade pasta is, I think I'll buy it store-made from now on."
4,Takes Some Practice,"Initially, I was quite frustrated trying to get the roller to work. The dough kept tearing and it was impossible to get strips that were long enough. However, after some experimentation, I found it was easier to make long ropes of dough, flatten them by hand to 1/4 inch thickness, and then put them through the roller, instead of cutting 1/4 inch thick slices as the instructions recommend. As soon as I figured that out, I was quite happy with the results.To reiterate what a previous reviewer said, however: Don't waste your time with the ravioli attachment. It's WAY more trouble than it's worth. A ravioli stamp produces better results, and is much easier to use."
1,Fell apart immediately,"I was very excited to receive this machine, unfortunately that feeling soon faded. As soon as I began to use the cutting attachment, the entire thing fell to pieces. I may have received a faulty machine, but surely it should have lasted longer than ten minutes. Ever the optimist, I requested a replacement in the hopes that the next one I receive is of higher quality. My fingers are crossed."
1,Inferior Quality,"This pasta machine didn't last one batch of pasta. The gears slipped within the first few cranks. Things just deteriorated from there. Sending it back. Pasta is really cheap at the store the point of this machine is not to save money, it is to have fresh pasta and a superior meal. I believe I will spring for the more expensive machine."
2,Not worth it,"I read all the reviews before buying this item.I just got through wrestling with it during my first effort at making pasta for ravioli. The clamp, which is absolutely necessary to use the machine, is poorly designed. If the manufacturer had invested a few pennies more, the clamp would have had rubber contacts, preventing it from coming off as easily as it did with every few turns of the crank.Other than that frustration, the pasta came out perfectly."
4,Pasta Machines,Good machine. Does what it is supposed to do. Purchased to do jewelry with. May buy one do actually do pasta with.
2,pretty poor quality,"I probobly should have listened to the other reviews. I just wanted a plain Jane pasta maker, and thought this was it, but the quality is pretty poor. I can tell I'll need a new vice after one or two more uses. I wish I'd gone with another model."
1,It came broken and Incorrectly Labeled,"When my husband opened it for Father's Day, it was broken. When I looked at the Amazon site to find out where I got it, it said the Book Rack - here it say VillaWare. I have been trying to track down the seller and couldn't find it on the web. Now I can finally send it back. It's taken me days to locate the seller. I have lost the receipt b/c it was a month ago that I bought the Al Dente Pasta Machine."
2,Not Happy!,I recieved this product tossed in a large box with out any type of bubble protection. It was so dented from being loose in the box I couldn't even give it to the person I bought it for. I've emailed Amazon.com but they haven't even replied. Guess it's not important to them.
4,It does what it is suppose to do,The only thing is that it does not stand on its own very well without locking it to a countertop. (they should but a vacuum seal on the bottom)
3,Imperfect Beethovan or was it Herbert?,"Not the recording I wanted, my fault.The second movement of the 8th not dramaticicaly realised.....first time ever I thought to critacise Beethovan!(The Kings Speech)"
5,fantastic in a flood,"I'm an expat living in a coastal area of Honduras. It rains like crazy here for the 3 months of winter and often floods the streets and yards. It is nearly impossible to get boots with arch protection here. It's important since you never know what the rivers have carried down from the mountains that and that may be hidden under 6 inches of water.If someone wanted to start an import business, bring in attractive rubber boots. Everything here looks like it came from a chicken processing plant."
5,Beautiful and well loved gift,"I have given this bear as a gift to all of my baby cousins and as baby shower gifts, and it is always very well received. The bear is durable and quite fluffy and beautiful. The option of naming a star after a child makes this so much more than a stuffed animal! It is a keepsake, it is educational (the child or mother can pick out a constellation and get the star's coordinates),and very meaningful for the child who will someday look to the heavens to find his or her star."
5,great pliers,"I love these pliers. Lost first pair in a divorce. This set hasn't made it out of the kitchen yet. Sweet heart won't let them out of her sight. She uses them to break dog bones and lobster shells. Oh well, not what I had in mind, but I'll just order another pair. Hopefully that pair will make it to the garage. Hate to have to order 8 for a lobster dinner party...LOL."
5,Super Handy,Nothing bad about these things. I have already used on multiple projects. Very smooth operation and provide a tight grip.
1,disappointing,No issues with the seller. Prompt delivery and product was in the advertised condition. The game is not worth purchasing at any price.
3,"Good, but...",This was a pretty decent book on NLP and trances. No where near as good as Undoing Yourself though. The tests and exercises are pretty good! Maybe the CD offers that something extra I am missing from this book.
2,Disappointing effort from fine writers,Lisa Kleypas and Julia Quinn are wonderful writers. This book is not up to either of their usual work. Often collection of short stories and novelas are a disappointment. I was surprised to find this book fit that stereotype.
2,Not as good as it should have been,"In my opinion, the only story here worth reading is Julia Quinn's. I couldn't believe how disappointed I was with Lisa Kleypas' story, given how much I loved Dreaming of You, and Kinley McGregor's story was terribly dull."
3,Is lame a strong word?,"I rushed to buy this book because ""Dreaming of You"" by Lisa Kleypas is one of my all time favorite Romance Novels. And just to see how Derek and Sarah have evolved over the years, in the Kleypas novella, was worth the price. Unfortunately, they are only the parents of the heroine (what was her name?) Oh why couldn't this have been a Derek and Sarah story instead.I hate to say it (boy do I hate to say it) other than the brief moments of Derek and Sarah in the Kleypas story, the rest of the book is a bit....lame. Maybe lame is too strong, but the rest of the stories limp along...ok limp along and lame mean almost the same thing. Buy ""Dreaming of You"" instead and give yourself a treat.I gave it 3 stars...one for each author...whatever. Julia Quinn...well maybe she needs a break. Kinley MacGregor's books are really good, but this story...well let's just say she does better with more pages."
3,Average...,"I am, as a rule, NOT a fan of anthologies, and sadly this book is no exception. I just cant get into short stories. They always feel rushed and good character development basically doesnt exist due to the brief length of each tale. I really only bought this book because Im a huge fan of Kleypas and Quinn. While I wouldnt necessarily say this was bad reading..I cant say it was a keeper. Im in a bit of a reading rutt right now..I cant find ANYTHING good to read lately...if anyone has any suggestions..feel free to email me.. :o)"
3,For Julia Quinn fans only,"Anthologies are like visiting a Baskin-Robbins ice cream shops: you can taste a different flavor while indulging in your favorite. Often the novellas work around a theme, such as a holiday or common characters.So I expected that ""Where's My Hero?"" would contain three heroes. The theme, however, supposedly is worked around three secondary male characters who are given stories that would show them worthy of our regard. Yet only Julia Quinn's story worked the magic. Ned (from ""Splendid"") seems plausible as a groom-to-be who is bethrothed to the wrong sister. Lisa Kleypas rushes her story of a wrong bethrothal, so that Dr. Jake changes from a mild-mannered physician to Incredible Hunk faster than you can say ""Dr. David Banner."" As for the third author and her story, both were so forgettable that all I remember is that the characters seemed far too modern for a medieval setting."
4,Good for a Collaboration,"I bought it primarily for Kinley MacGregor, who I absolutely adore and was subsequently introduced to Lisa Kleypas. I have read several books from Lisa Kleypas since then and I really enjoy her writing as well. The third author, Julia Quinn was alright, but it certainly did not inspire me to read anymore of her books."
4,"2 out of 3 for me, with one plus-size heroine","I got this book to read the short story ""Against the Odds"" by Lisa Kleypas and I wasn't dissapointed. I was oddly supprised how much I loved ""Midsummer's Knight"" by Kinley MacGregor. It was my favorite of the two. The character Kenna is descibed as being plump yet the hero loved her sooo much. I fell for the character Simon. This is my second read by Sherrilyn Kenyon and I can't wait to read more. So, in other words there is something for everyone, but no promise you will love all three stories."
5,This is my dream collaboration of authors,"Okay, so admittedly I have not yet read MacGregor's novella, since I have yet to get my hands on the preceding Master of Desire, but a thoroughly enjoyed Kleypas' Against All Odds and Quinn's A Tale of Two Sisters.Though I'm sure some of my emotional response to Odds can be attributed to the fact that I was dead tired while reading it (I could NOT put it down!) the story was incredibly sweet. Kleypas has a way of portraying intense emotion (longing in particular)through her words that is unmatched. Plus we get the added bonus of catching up with Jake Linely and the Craven's, need I say more?Then of course there is Quinn's story. She may not elicit the same emotional response that Kleypas does, but her characters are always extremely likeable and easy to relate to, and, of course, her wit and humor make the pages sparkle.Wonderful book to curl up with."
3,"Good, but environmentally disturbing...","This book helped me out a lot in terms of finding areas to ski in when I first moved to Washington from Montana. However, some of the dialogue disturbed me, as I am a cross-country skier who also works for an organization that fights for the elimination of catastrophically damaging logging techniques. One quote is as follows: ""In the rosy glow of the 1980s, it seemed that the overcutting of timber on forest lands was, if anything, a boon to the cross-country skier: more forest roads to explore in the winter, more clearcuts for downhill runs, and easier access to high meadows."" At one point, it even described clearcuts to be ""picturesque."" I see clearcuts as the rape of the land, and because I learned how to cross country ski on narrow trails used for hiking in the summer rather than forest service roads, many of the descriptions turn me off to areas rather than draw me in. Where can I ski in a truly wild area, enclosed by frosted trees?"
3,"Good Shorts, Shallow Pockets","The shorts are very confortable but I have one (1) major issue with them. The pockets are very shallow, when you sit down anything you have in your pockets is coming out!"
3,Russell Athletic Jersey Shorts,Nicely made but I guess I will never get used to the way to long inseam. I returned them!
1,huge,These things are huge. They hang half way between your knee and your ankle and are very uncomfortable. The material is poor quality. Definitely a big disappointment for a product from Russell Athletic.
5,MY HUSBAND LOVED THEM!,I ordered these for my husband. He wanted a longer leg on his shorts. These are fantastic! He loved them and in fact I am ordering more for him Highly recommended product!
1,Overpriced,I bought the same product at Kmart/Sears for half the price and no waiting on US snail mail.
3,Sized for Giants,"Admittedly, I am a big guy. These seemed perfect. What I did not realize was how big they are. The waistband reachs all the way around me without binding, however they are really long. Even with them pulled-up to old-man height, they still come to the top of my knees. That are soft and comfortable, but REALLY big."
2,Seams rip,"I like to wear these as pj bottoms. The drawstring is great, as are the pockets. The length is perfect. However, every pair I've owned (in excess of 10 pair) has had a problem with the seams tearing at the pockets. Maybe I'm putting too much stuff in the pocket and stressing the seam? It's just annoying to have holes in the shorts after only washing them a time or 2.The shorts are also too expensive here. More so depending on the color you choose, as some are not shipped Prime.I'll be looking for another brand of similar shorts."
2,Russell Athletic Jersey Pull-on Shorts,Same review as for the jersey pants. light enough to workout in and not get overheated.biggest problem. lousy manufacturing and qualilty control. very poor stitching. seams ripped inside of four weeks. otherwise workable.
5,5X for less than $9!?,"I weigh about 420lbs, 60in plus waist, and these are not even tight on me. Nice light fabric navy blue, draw string, two side pockets and a little silver ""R"" on left leg near bottom. Very happy customer."
5,Good and Inexpensive,"I wear these to the gym constantly. They are a nice weight, look good, and have good pockets for carrying in my keys / wallet. Great value!"
5,exactly right,"These pants are soft, wash well and have good pockets. The length is a bit long but works to cover up boxers."
4,better than expected...,"Solid, loose, good fitting shorts. Plus it has pockets. Length is good for me, now that I've gotten used to it. Overall, they are my favorite pair of shorts."
1,pics look good product sucks,"i have been sucker twice , and i do not blame u but, i have learn my lesson i will never again buy this product again. wrong size sent ,poor manufacturing, just plain suck this item I. A . P. O. S."
1,Wrong Item,These were the long pull on sweat pants...since I am in Iraq...nothing a pair of scissors can't fix....
2,Smaller than others in same size,"Did not care for these shorts, elastic wait band not totally covered, so it rips at you skin after wearing for awhile. The more active you are the worse it feels. Also these are the only mens large I have ordered that are smaller then other large sizes alredy owned."
5,PURE GENIUS,"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST SINGLE I'VE EVER HEARD, AND STILL IS SINCE I HEARD IT THOSE TWO OR SO YEARS AGO"
5,Great text in a classroom setting,"I used this book in my Treatment of the Offender Class, and thought it worked nicely as one in a series of readers that critically explores the costs and benefits of alternative sanctions for convicted offenders. The author makes empirically based suggestions to reduce sexual victimization rates and in so doing challenges many of the current practices in dealing with sexual predators,, Plus it was an awesome read and students loved it!"
2,This book was a disappointment.,"This book is just an extended version of what should have been a journal article. In the first half of the book, there is a biased assessment of ""the system."" The perspective is clearly sympathetic to sex offenders, whom the author believes are being unfairly treated. The second half of the book includes numerous quotes from sex offenders, mostly complaints. Some of this is interesting, but the author fails to analyze these quotes and explain a common theme--that these sex offenders do not truly believe that what they did was wrong. I am further disappointed that the book does not include any in-depth explanation on the part of the offenders as to why they committed these crimes."
2,Probably the worst shampoo I've ever used.,"I bought this because I've been wanting to try it for awhile now. My friend uses it and it makes her hair very soft and glossy looking. But when I tried it, it did just the opposite. I have long thick hair. And this shampoo made my hair feels rough and has absolutely no shine whatsoever. Pantene is usually a decent line of hair products. But I guess this just wasn't for me. I'll be going back to my old shampoo and conditioner-Bed Head."
1,Disgusting!,"This product (like all Pantene products) is awful. My boyfriend used to use it because he liked the smell, and I finally had to take it away and buy some good stuff for him. An hour after he got out of the shower, his hair was greasy, and by the end of the day, it was beyond disgusting. He also started to get really bad dandruff. After looking at the ingredients and realizing this shampoo is full of harsh sulfates and wax, I immediately threw it out. He hasn't had a problem since. Don't buy this shampoo!"
2,Don't Phunk With My Heart,"It can be argued for days whether The Black Eyed Peas sold out or not, but the quality of their music has certainly deteriorated greatly since the addition of Fergie to the group. A group that was once of the cutting-edge of grass-roots hip-hop is now making mediocre pop music. Case in point: Don't Phunk With My Heart. While it's not horrible, it's still pretty lame. Cheesy lyrics, cheesy production, and Fergie's constant repetition of ""No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart"" sounds like nails on a chalkboard after about the 20th time she says it. I highly doubt I'll be buying the album after a weak lead single like this one."
1,LISA LISA!,How come that at the moment everyone is covering Lisa Lisa & cult jam (here: I wonder if I take you home....and Nina Sky: Can you feel the beat) but noone gives us back Lisa Lisa who is STILL THERE and touring ? Lame re-do of a great original.
5,Great alternative to RTS,"I'm sick to death of Company of Heroes and Command & Conquer type games, where I can't even process a full thought before having to fling units all over a map in panicked desperation, so this game (and series) is exactly what I've been craving. This game is quite ugly compared to the modern RTS darlings, but you can actually plot and contemplate your moves, which is a benefit that fully overtakes any complaints about graphics. There's a whole slew of scenarios included, and a .zip file on the Battlefront website will give you hundreds more (including some nice non-historical change-ups, like the Axis forces invading a Catholic school in Ottawa)."
3,"OLD GAME WITH NOT GREAT GRAPHICS, BUT WORKS WELL ON WINDOWS 7.","GAME PLAYS WELL ON WINDOWS 7. LOVE IT. YES, THE NEWER VERSIONS IN THE SERIES ARE BETTER, BUT IT'S STILL A COOL GAME."
1,Sub-Par,This game is no longer state of the art and I doubt it ever was. Graphics are disappointing and the missions tend to be biased. The whole concept of issuing orders and then waiting for sixty seconds to see how they turn out is unrealistic. Even in the 40ies troups were equipped with radio that made battle more agile and modern warfare possible.
4,Great War Game,"One of the best war games I have ever played. The graphics are not that great, but the gameplay is awesome. If you like the shot'em up type games then this game is not for you. If you like strategy and realistic type action this is the one."
1,Nothing Special,This has such great reviews so I thought I'd give it a try. I didn't find it to do anything different than my normal conditioners? After trying I do think the price is a little high. It might just be the Garnier line of products I haven't found them to be that great... At least I have some extra conditioner in the house!
5,Excellent! Fast Read!,Very much enjoyed reading this book. Strongly recommend it as gift for teenage girls (or boys) ... but young adults will like it as well. Helps make the era Christ lived seem real today. Miriam is the story of Christ's mother when she was a teenager and you will Love her!
5,Lonesome Heroes,Great addition to my Leonard Cohen Collection. I love this man. Sorry I just discovered him last year. Making up for lost time.
1,Leonard Cohen's lonesome heroes,"I love all of Leonard's music and was expecting to hear more of it. But was so disappointed when I watched this whole documentary and most of it was just people talking about him. I think there should have been some of his music along with this DVD, like an added concert or something. I am an artist and I love his music to paint to.I bought two of these, one as a gift. But now I am not going to give the gift."
2,Much too sensitive,"I bought this Pedometer for my wife as we are both trying to get back to better health. She has another Pedometer she uses,but it makes a lot of noise in her office causing heads to turn. This Robic M-327 is much quieter and has seven day memory which is great since she keeps a daily log. The problem is the sensitivity of this pedometer cannot be fully adjusted and so it counts each step as two and is so far off that it becomes unusable. Have tried repositioning it and sliding the sensitivity to the least sensitive position, nothing works."
1,Doesn't work,"This pedometer was the highest price at the sports store so it seemed a reliable pick, but I'm returning it. Despite adjusting the sensitivity button its step counts are wildly inaccurate. The features sound great, but it's useless if it can't count."
2,A steady decline...,"Scars Of Tomorrow seem to be on a pretty steady decline. Their early albums were decent, but by no means groundbreaking. Their two Victory releases are anything but memorable. There's nothing here at all to really get excited about and I quite frankly question how much longer this band is going to be around. The production is pretty substandard (geez Victory open up your wallets a little more for your bands that don't sound like Hawthorne Heights or Taking Back Sunday) but thats not even really the major issue. The songs just aren't that good. Substandard metalcore, nothing more nothing less--not even on a technical level are these songs impressive. Completely forgettable which is unfortunate because they're a nice group of guys. Oh well."
2,What the f**k happened??!!,"I was so looking forward to this release. I own all Scars of Tomorrow releases, and had big hopes for this disc. But...how dissapointing. Very average, very bland, very uninspiring. Then again, it seems like the whole ""hardcore scene"" is getting to be that way. Want something good and original to listen to? Check out either release from The Number Twelve Looks Like You (An Inch of Gold for an Inch of Time, Nuclear Sad Nuclear) or the debut from As Cities Burn (Son, I loved You at Your Darkest). Anyway, this is a very mediocer release, as have been all the new releases from Victory as of late. Oh, I almost forgot, don't forget to check out ""Each Breath Haunted"" by The Banner. REAL hardcore with an old school punk feel!!!"
2,booorrrriiinnngggg,"typical boring metalcore. not at a special thing about it. these guys put on a pretty boring live show also. dont buy it, download it and then delete it after you realize that it sucks"
2,"BEWARE - for me, an expensive mistake...!!!","Not only did I spend a month trying to find a place to service this mower but was just told it is TOAST after only 2 years. I have a very small yard so that is the main reason for getting an electric mower and I decided cordless would also be worth the investment... B&D was worthless in trying to provide service answers by telling me to drive 3-4 hours to service centers. I live in Springfield, MO which should offer somewhere to service it. Finally found a small appliance shop that was willing to help me out. The switch was blown and one of the batteries dead and you must replace both not just one ($240). I maintained this mower by the book and did enjoy the easy use of it - just extremely disappointed in quality and lack of how to service it. It would cost more to repair then replace, however I'm done with Black & Decker!!"
1,Doesn't even last more than 2 minutes on my lawn....,"Warning : Do not buy this mower if you have even the slighest amount of thick grass. It will not last more than 2 minutes on my lawn...I pulled it out of the box, charged it for multiple days, and tried it last night on my back lawn. Needless to say I did three strips of grass and it was dead. I was shocked and upset that this mower couldn't handle anymore.I would strongly advise that you DO NOT buy a cordless electric mower until they improve the technology to handle more types of lawns.Overall the mower doesn't perform and I will be returning it."
3,Good but short lived,"My CMM1000 recently died after two years. The blade suddenly started rotating slower and slower with every start. I think my St. Augustine burned up the rotor. That being said, when it did work, it mowed all of our 8,000 square foot lawn, and was more than worth it because of thw low maintenance. I probably won't buy another one but would recommend it to someone with a different type of grass."
5,great mower,"THis is a quiet effecient mower - and no gas or pull start.the charge is sufficient to cut my 1/3 acre yard. the only minor problem is having to slow down in thick grass, but that gives the mulcher time to work."
3,Amazon Dropped the Ball on this one: 4 Stars for Mower performance 2 Stars for Amazon delivery quality control,"The Black & Decker CMM1000 is a very good lawnmower - uses no gasoline and is easy to start. It does a good job cutting the lawn, in some cases exceeds the mulching capability of my older noisier gasoline mulching mower.However ...The mower arrived in a poorly sealed carton, some of the bolts holding the handles were missing and the mower did not keep itself in the on position until I drove it to a Black & Decker service center (1 hour drive) for repair.I am disappointed in the quality conrol exhibited by Amazon for this large machine and will never purchase any similar items from them again."
2,Captain We need more Power!,"After reading mostly positive reviews, I bought the Black & Decker Cordless mower about 1 year ago.I've had one season to put it through it's paces.I have a fifth of an acre lot, so even less than the manufacturer's advertised area of grass to cut.I have followed all the instructions, leaving it plugged in when not in use.But nearly every time I use it, it does not get through my yard without pooping out.I'm very disappointed, since it costs so much.Despite the savings of trips to the gas station and the fumeless, quiet cutting, I would not buy it again.Be warned."
4,Box Fan on Wheels!,"They point, they laugh, they scowl. Every weekend I whip out my orange box fan on wheels, and my 3000ish square feet of lawn (st augustine) is trimmed to a low 'fro in 40 minutes or less!I think this is a decent mower, it has neither the best cut nor the most power. However, it has proved to keep up with thick st augistine for two summers. I love it for the conveinence. Pop out the charge cord, pop in the saftey key - an your off to the races. I cannot explain what a timesaver this is - between my mower, cordless 12"" weed wacker (way underpowed for edging), and electric edgehog, I have a manicured little suburbia property in about an hour. 2 solid cuts per charge.Three complaints:1) the cut can be uneven - I think this may have to do with the narrow deck.2) the mower will not save you from 8"" st augustine in July - so cut often when it's growing season (it's too convienent not to)3) my 7am neighbor does not own one (living in the land of single pane windows)"
1,What a let-down!!,"I ordered this mower in May of this year, I used it twice and it stopped working. Not only that but, the two times I used it, it did not cut 1/3 of an acre. I had to charge the battery 1/2 way through each time. It was extremly hard to push, (on flat ground) and looked like it barely trimmed the lawn even though it was set on the lowest setting. I am now in the process of returning it. I would not reccommend this mower to my worst enemy."
3,A heavy mower,"I have this mower for almost three years. It is great not having to worry about gas, oil, etc., but for a middle aged woman like myself, it is is heavy. I cannot get it up stairs behind my house. It does not take kindly to hills. You really have to push it. I paid 400 for this and am now going to get a corded model. It mows ok. It has never failed to start. It is reliable. But for me, it is heavy. I am not slight, nor am I powerfully built either!!"
1,junk w/ bad customer service,Bought a couple of yrs ago- quit running 6 mos after warranty was up. Black & Decker blew me off when I tried to get satisfaction/repair. Haven't bought a Black & Decker product since.
3,Good enough for a small lawn. Less noise and no exhast to breathe,"Good enough for a small lawn. Less noise and no exhast to breatheBlack & Decker CMM1000 19"" was one of the ones recalled for their proclivity to catch on FIRE when charging...Black and Decker wants me to drive the mower over 100 miles to the closest service station and then leave it there for a time and then go back and fetch it... I have yet to get the recall work done.I have owned my mower for 6 years and the batteries just died.I got inexpensive 18AH replacements on an auction site for under $50 and did the installation myself in less than half an hour.I use the mulching feature.Mulching means No bagging and need for less fertilizer :)I mow every week now in no time and I used to dread the cord of my previous electric mower.Expensive purchase price... Batteries if purchased for the right price are a deal.No other maintenance needed to date."
1,Unreliable...,"I've owned the CMM1000 for a couple of years. I've followed the battery instructions to the letter. At first I was a huge fan, the mower could make it through the entire yard without the mess of a cord or gasoline. However, by the end of two seasons, the charge only lasted for about 1/2 the yard. Then this season I went to start it and all that came out was a puff of smoke and it's dead. I've kept great care of it and for the amount of money I spent on this thing, I'd expect it to last more than two seasons!"
3,"Great idea, poor longevity","I loved this mower when I bought it four years ago: Quiet, clean, easy to change the blade height, easy on, easy off, easy to store for the winter (no draining fluids, etc.). By the end of second summer the battery could no longer last the 30 minutes it took me to cut my lawn of 1/4 acre of bluegrass and courser fescue. For summer three I purhcased a new battery, which was expensive and extraordinarily difficult to replace and install. That battery worked Ok for the summer, but by the beginning of this summer, I was back to loss of power before I'd finished. For what it's worth, I gave the mower to my neighbor who has a smaller lawn of just bluegrass and he's been quite happy with it."
3,Wrong bag,"I wish this had the hard plastic indestructible ""bag"" catcher as my old electric Sunbeam. Otherwise, this is a great mower for my small yard. No fire hazard, no stink, no cord, no tuneups, no oil changes, no ""bad gas""."
2,Some people swear by it. Others swear.,"I purchased this mower in December 2002 and it worked well for one season. Now it's in the shop for a product recall. I'll probably ditch this one the next time it fails.If you're looking for something environmently friendly, look into the Luxus 38. I wrote a review of this ""old fashioned"" model. It never needs gas and the batteries are non existant. Sometimes old fashoined is better.From what I've seen of the reviews, it seems that those who purchased this model years ago are satisfied. But the newer models are having problems.Read my review of the Luxus 38 and decide for yourself."
1,CMM1000 a Waste of Money,"I have had this mower for two years. It has never mowed properly, even after repairs. It dies constantly, won't cut even normal grass growth, and definitely can't be lowered enough to mulch as it just won't cut the grass without dieing. This product is the worst item I have ever owned, and I will be going back to a gasoline powered mower before the summer starts."
3,"Nice mower, loses its charge quickly","I have a small lot, 100 x 120 & this baby is down just as I finish my yard. The charging indicator has never worked. Doesn't do well in thick or wet grass. Besides that it does a good job. If you have a plush lawn or large lawn, look to another mower. I love the fact that it is electric, which means starting is easy. This mower is very quiet compared to a gas model."
3,heavy mower,Thought this would be a great environmentally correct mower. It is but is very heavy and replacing the battery i a pain in the neck.
5,Only one small problem,"I like the concept... a cordless electric mulching mower. We have named ours ""The Al Gore Memorial Lawnmower,"" because we bought it after watching ""An Inconvenient Truth.""The only problem I can identify is: the blade does not protrude much beyond the wheels, unlike my 16-year-old Toro gasoline mower. This means that, if you're cutting close to curbs, walls, or flowerbed edging, there is a 2"" band which remains uncut. Do you suppose they'll expect me to buy a batter-powered string trimmer next?"
2,Needs perfecting,"It was well packaged with speedy Amazon delivery, and I looked forward to using it (while charging overnight before it's first use, as directed. I don't know if I got a lemon or if it's just underpowered, but unfortunately mine keeps stalling, even when not attempting to cut very high grass. Works great when cutting the whispers of grass (though louder than I would have predicted), the freedom from smoke and gas fumes was very nice. However, if you attempt to actually cut the lawn, the use of it was so frustrating that I returned the item. I would cut maybe 1 foot of grass, then it would stall. I was trying this on a 0.4 acre plot, no rocks or anything, just grass."
1,Poor quality,Do not buy this unless you like to take chances; maybe you will get a good one. Out of the box mine would not stay on because the lever that starts the mower would not stay engaged. I had to use a bungie cord! I was able to mow my yard once and then the battery would not hold a charge. I returned it to Amazon and bought a Neuton cordless mower from DR Products.
4,Met my expectations,"I never liked gasoline mowers as you have to buy gas and fill them. Also, your garage and car smells like gasoline. So, for years I had a cord electric mower. No buying gas and filling the tank. No gasoline smell. However, the cord was inconvenient and took extra time to mow. I think this cordless is the best of both worlds.I read the posted reviews and it was as everyone said. The reason that I rated 4 stars, instead of 5, was that it is on the heavy side. On the whole, if you are looking to get away from the gasoline and cords, this will meet your expectations, too."
4,"Nice mower, good workout","As a new homeowner, I am not an expert on outdoor equipment. I purchased this mower with a recommendation to buy an electric mower. I did not want to purchase one with a cord, so I purchased this one. I did have to take it in because it wouldn't stay on, but the staff at the Black and Decker service center were very helpful, and I got it back the same day. I borrowed my neighbors mower to mow the first time, and have since used mine. Mine is heavier to push, but less maintenance. Even with the minor difficulties I must say I'm pretty happy with my mower. I can just charge it and go. If you have a large yard and/or super long grass it may take more than one charge to complete your yard. It is perfect for my yard, approx .25 acre.So if you have strong arms, a small yard, and a desire to help the environment (a little) this is the mower for you!"
5,"Excellent Mower, recommended","I had a Ryobi cordless mower for about 10 years or so, and it was getting worn out. Liked it so much I never wanted to replace it, so kept putting it off. Finally I had to, and picked this one. I like it even better. The cutting height adjustment is much easier, and wet grass does not stick to the body as much (either different plastic, or my imagination) Would recommend it to anyone."
2,Not as expected,"I have used this mower about 2-3 times. The battery charge lasts about 45 minutes before it goes into yellow region of charge indicator (time to recharge). When cutting grass, the mower leaves some larger blades of grass partially uncut and you have to go back and recut the grass. This is not a big problem if you have a small yard but with a larger yard it can be very frustrating. This problem may be due to the narrow blade on the cordless mower which is much narrower than my gas mower. I have gone back to using my gas mower for most of my mowing since it doesn't choke down nearly as often and I don't have to deal with recharging after 45 min. or going back and recutting grass."
1,WHY do I keep falling for Black & Decker products,"This worked for a few weeks. Had to have the battery replaced under warranty. Then, something in the circuitry went out...wouldn't/won't run. Tired of messing with it. Going to leave it on the sidewalk and hope someone steals it. Most of the other B& D lawn care tools I have bought in the past have also had similar failures... Get up one day, it won't run. Wiring problems (shabby assembly, really), mechanical glitches (cheap parts, really)... No more Black & Decker ANYTHING in my house... The new mantra: ""Buy cheap, buy twice!"""
3,review cordless mower,"I read the reviews of this electric mower prior to purchase. Several reviews stated that the life of the battery after charging was insufficient. I wish I had payed more attention to this and followed up on it prior to purchase. My battery life is 35 - 45 minutes and it takes several hours to recharge the battery. Therefore, cutting my yard winds up taking at least all day with all of this charging figured into it. My yard is only about 1/2 acre but I have to recharge the battery twice with cutting the yard.Very frustrating!Mary"
4,"Good mower, but...","It's a good mower for my small yard. It has plenty of power for tall grass and the battery life is more than adequate. The CMM1000 is not as maneuverable, in tight spaces and around corners, as I would like.An area that needs improvement is the on/off system. My mower kept shutting off until I discovered the safety bail on the handle was not being pulled back far enough for the on switch to latch. I had to remove some rubber from the handle to allow the safety bail to travel closer to the handle and permit the on switch to latch. This solved the shutting off problem."
3,Bad Battery Life,"Mower is heavy, if you have ANY type of incline, even the slightest, get ready for real work. Not bad on the flat sections though.It also doesn't last that long when mowing your lawn....1/2 hour at best with full power and then it steadily peters out. Other reviews here indicate new batteries at some point are going to cost anywhere from 100 to $200 to replace.I am a little dissappointed."
5,This is my 2nd one,I bought the first one 7 or 8 yr ago. The old lawn mower needs a new battery which will cost about $200.
5,its just right,"I had my first CMM1000 for nine years, mowing/mulching and collecting all the leaves in the yard for compost. Its quiet, very easy to use, starts and stops on a dime. There was no maintenance whatsoever except blade sharpening. The battery was starting to go finally. Otherwise there was general wear. I would have had to replace the collection bag and the blade and maybe the handle pads. There was also some damage (holes, I guess from hitting so many rocks over the years) on the bottom, so grass was starting to collect within the motor compartment. It was still working liking a champ though.I just bought a second one. This mower is clearly an outstanding product."
2,An expensive mistake.,"This mower is not a high quality product. It takes a full 24 hours to recharge. It's performance as a bagging mower is poor, especially if the grass is damp, when it picks up almost nothing before it clogs. It performs ok as a mulching mower if the grass is very dry, which means I need to wait until noon to start mowing. The indicator light showing whether it is finished charging or not stays continually on red, making it useless. The indicator guage showing how much charge is left while mowing stays on fully charged until it is almost dead and then moves suddenly into the red. Now it has been recalled for fire danger and the nearest authorized repair facility is two hours away.I wouldn't buy this product again."
1,COMPLETE JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This piece of garbage worked twice on my average size lawn, and the third time, the motor siezed up, making a terrible sound. It was fully charged, and seemed okay. Now the plastic washer between the blade and the motor is shredded, and I was absolutely NOT mowing over anything besides grass!! I cannot believe that such an expensive item broke so quickly. Heed my advice and think long and hard if you're considering this. I was so excited about getting this, but I'm now as miserable as can be."
4,"Good mower, bad packaging","On delivery on Tuesday, June 26, 2006, the packaging was so badly damaged that the UPS driver offered to send the mower back to the shipper if any parts were missing.None were, but the height setting mechanism turned out to be broken internally and one of the handle knob bolts was too bent to tighten the knob. Although we saved all the packaging, I decided to see what the local DeWalt Service Center could do rather than to attempt to repack the mower.DeWalt was able to make both replacement/repairs under warranty, but because of the time needed to obtain the height adjustment spring and for an out-of-town trip on my part, the first day I could retrieve the mower was July 17.In the three weeks since then, it has had 3-4 hours use, partly on very high grass, and has performed very well. The end of fumes, gas fillings and oil and filter changes is great progress. I am looking forward to further use when the current hot, dry weather ends so that the grass starts growing again."
5,"Seven years, still cutting fine","It's been at least seven years, maybe more, since I bought this mower. I don't use it exclusively, but I have used it every year with no problems of any kind, and I used it this morning on its original batteries. In the right conditions--small to medium lawn, dry grass that is not too long, no steep slopes--this mower works very well, and would have advantages over a gasoline mower."
3,Good detail poor reference,"DeRoest has written a good start for an AIX reference book. I have found that the most disappointing feature is the references in the index.The topics and detail are sufficient to guide a new or seasoned administrator. The problem is finding the information. The index is very poor.Consider this a text to study the unique features of AIX, do not consider this a text for quick reference or to discuss similarities and differences to other flavors of Unix."
1,Save your money,"This book is just plain bad. I haven't been able to find any redeeming item inside. I hope somebody reads these reviews and decides not to buy this book. Maybe that would be the redeeming effort I'm looking for. Usually I can mine a few nuggets out of a bad or marginal book but this one takes the cake. Please save your money, and send a message to the publisher they will listen to. This book should've been caught somewhere in quality control and never made it to the printing presses."
1,Worst index I've ever seen,"I bought this as a reference for AIX, as I'm coming over from Solaris and HP/UX. Big mistake. It's nearly impossible to look up anything in this book. It has literally the worst index I've ever seen. I just ordered ""The AIX Survival Guide"" by Siegert, which I'm told is more what I need. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book."
1,One of the WORST books I've ever read.,I made the mistake of purchasing this book at a local book store as I needed an AIX book that day and they only had 2 books.This book looked to be more useful than the other book but as soon as I started reading it I found out how bad it was.Much of this book is woefully antiquated and unfortunately much of it has AIX version 3 information instead of 4.I read the book from cover to cover as I needed to get as much AIX knowledge as I could that day and I can tell you that I learned about 4 things from the book that would be useful. The rest of the book had information that has little to no bearing on administering a system or applies to a version 3 system and not AIX 4.X.Please DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK AS YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN IT!
2,Poorly organized.,This book falls short in index. You can never reach a command by searchingin the index. No command summary is also there. It does not list many procedures step-by-step which would have been really useful(eg. doing an NFS or configuringan NIS). Could improve a lot.
1,This Book Collects dust in my cubicle....,Luckily I inherited this book from sombody that got fired. I would have been furious if I had paid for it. I administer serveral hundred AIX boxes from SP2's to workstations. Nothing in this book has ever been helpful to me. It is poorly organized and trying to find what you are looking for is impossible. Very disapointing. It makes me wonder why so many people have this on their bookshelf. Maybe because it's thick and cumbersome they think it's packed with goodies. It' NOT!Try something that is thinner and infinitely more helpful for AIX administrators: The AIX Survival Guide by Siegert. It has led me to all of my AIX answers.
2,Too Much Reliance on SMIT,"I know that SMIT is 'the thing', but in my opinion, this, as well as other books on AIX should concentrate first on making sure that people can do without SMIT if they have to. You never know when it will assemble a command erroneously, or it might be down."
2,General/High level detail. NOT for existing AIX users...,"I bought this book in hopes that it would provide a detailed reference for doing most any type of system admin. I also hoped that it too showed a comparison between AIX and other flavors like BSD and SVR4. It did at some levels, but fell short. It presented some history on AIX and also covered some hardware changes over the years. Since I am already very familiar with other UNIX's, I had hoped this would be a reference/command guide, but it was not. It has you depend heavily on the info and man pages for usage. I felt the book did not cover enough detail overall and was very weak in covering kernel config/tuning. There must be better out there..."
5,no cradle cap,this is the best baby bath stuff ever. was gifted this set with my first baby and immediately bought another when i got pregnant again. the lotions last a very long time. my first baby had a problem with cradle cap until i got the foam and it magically went away--second baby never got it. its worth its weight in gold.
2,Strong smell,"I really wanted to love these products but I could not get past the smell! To me it was too strong and it covered up the ""baby smell"" that I love. Fortunately I found the Lavanilla baby products after this misstep and my baby smells like a baby again!"
3,Baby,This works pretty good it just has a strong smell and some of the directions are like dutch or german. I don't read either.
2,Bad Quality,"I purchased this mail box on Amazon as the local place that carries them were out and would not be in stock for a long time. When the new mail box arrived I took the old box down, first mistake, then opened the (undamaged) box and found the new box was broke in 2 places, because I had already taken the old one down I had to spend the next hour fixing the new box and because there was nothing included to mount it I had to spend more time making a base so I could install this on the existing post. I wonder if the place selling it knew it was broke and just passed it along."
4,Cute Cedar Mailbox.,"We needed a mailbox in a hurry. Didn't want just a ""mailbox"" from a box store as we live in the mountains in a log home. It had to maintain the character of the location but be relatively inexpensive. We had drooled over those offered by the Amish sites but they were very costly. When this one was found on Amazon, it seemed to fit our requirements. The reviews almost turned us off but we went ahead anyway.It arrived in two days as promised. It is sturdy, good looking, and is acceptable to the USPO. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the door does not have a latching mechanism. It does close tightly now but am concerned about the future.We like it!"
3,"Nice enough for the price, but poorly packaged","The mailbox is nice enough for the price, however, it was not packaged properly. The box has a large hole in the front, which resulted in three pieces of the mailbox to break off during shipping. We should be able to repair it, but it would be nice to get a new product that doesn't require repair."
2,Very cheap looking,"Honestly? The illustrations on the box are deceptive, and make this look like a really well built little mailbox. It's not. The construction is cheap and shoddy. The three front pieces on the door aren't aligned with each other at all, and look like a school kid cut them out and glued them on. Staples were visible from the front. Took it out of the box, looked at it, and decided immediately, without a moment's hesitation, that it was being returned. I'm giving it two stars because delivery was excellent (always is!), return process was a breeze (always is!) and I'm sure that appearance aside, it is a functional mail box. Two stars may be overly generous - save your money and look elsewhere."
5,great mailbox!,We love this mailbox! The style goes with our home nicely and we have cedar trees which makes this mailbox even more appealing. It arrived on time and it was a positive purchase.
2,Not the best CD you can buy.,"The reviewer ""Poor Farmer"" knows nothing about music.Lena Horne was never influenced by Della Reese. He looks to be about 17 years old and is stuffing the ballot box. Get the Porgy & Bess/Jamaica CD or the Waldorf/At the Sands CD over this one. This is boring, and there are much better band sing singers."
3,Can't get the size right on these!,"Softwalks typically aren't consistent in width as I oftn have to order 1/2 size larger in width for comfort. I always have to order 1/2 bigger as well because they always seem short. I've tried both the 1/2 size wider and the regular width in this pair and still have had no luck. The Med was way too tight and the wide is way too big! Very disapointed and am so frustrated I'm about to swear off this brand all together as paying all this return shipping is CRAZY just because this brand isn't consistent!Not the best quality either. I wore these around the house for 1/2 hour trying to adjust to the tightness on the Med, then again to the flipping around looseness of the wide and they both seemed to develepe white creases in the black leather.Both sizes have to go to back! Shame - the inside padding is very comfortable."
2,Not a Good Way to Learn Lipreading,"The package contains a 50 page manual and a video tape. The video tape gave a good, well-organized summary of the many lip positions, but it all went to fast. This was preceded by a too-easy test of a person reading a series of sentences, almost all of which I was able to understand even at a very low volume setting. The next step is you go to the book, where many series of words are listed. You watch yourself in a hand mirror while you practice saying the words. So most of the work is with the book, not with the video, and there is no attempt to measure your progress during this part of the learning."
1,Awful,It was awful and didn't really taste like barbecue sauce at all. It had quite a sour flavor. I actually really enjoy intense flavors of all different kinds of spices but I actually threw this bottle out after trying it. Don't waste your money.
5,Great Book,"This book is really insightful and extremely helpful. I would recommend it to people of ALL ages and walks of life, not just parents. I am a high school teacher and a youth leader, and my perspective has been completely changed because of this book."
3,Just like Fish - meat & bones,"Overall a good read. Gives you an opportunity to think of different ways to address issues, or prepare for them. Obviously from a Calvinistic point of view (bones), so you have to pick out what is good and doctrinally sound (meat) and what isn't. I don't mind doing that if the book is worth the effort. This one might be worth the effort...still undecided. If you're a 5 point C, you'll love it. I personally believe the Lord gave us free will, which is why I wanted to read the book...to help our children with their free will.Thankful for a savior who IS easy to understand, and simply requires faith like a child to believe...not deep insight and evaluation before I'm ever considered saved."
4,A Helpful Resource For Many Years,"I have been given many books by the administrators where I work over the past 6.5 years, and this one was gifted to me in 2006. Although I am not the parent of a teenager (I have two girls - 4 and 7), this book has provided me practical strategies for teaching the sixth graders in my classroom. It has also reminded me how the truths of God's Word can empower me in every situation. I have countless opportunities to be used as an instrument of change, and I simply need to trust that God is accomplishing His redemptive purpose in every situation. Paul David Tripp is the brother of Tedd Tripp, the author of another book I recommend - Shepherding a Child's Heart."
5,Practical book to help raising teens,Mr. Tripp gives parents practical tips on turning struggles during the teenage years into opportunities for communication and growth. A great book for parents [and teachers] of tweens and teens.
5,Get this book!,"I have read many Christian parenting books. This is in my top 2! Not preachy or all about theories. Just real stuff you can use. Very easy to read, funny. He puts parents in their place. Yeah, teenagers are difficult but you learn that parents are really the ones that need to change and get their act together! So thankful I am reading it now when my kids are 13 and 11!"
2,Useless after short period,This unit could not be reset after a couple of walks rendering it useless.
3,Good but ..,"..the Modifications section is a bit weak, consequently a little disappointing for the off road enthusiast. Not surprisingly, geared primarily towards the U.K. owner of Series 1 vehicles.Good overview of the vehicle and what to expect."
2,It's a disappointment,"I was very disappointed, when I got this CD. If you know the original song you'll be disappointed, because the remixes haven't kept an charm of the original song. So they didn't with Celine's voice. You can hear more of the additional singers, than of Celine. It really doesn't have anything that gives this remixes any character, like the remixes of ""My Heart will go on"" which at least still featured Celine as the main singer and the sound of the original song. If you love ""It's all coming back to me now"", don't buy this CD!"
1,This CD is dangerous.,"This song was written and recorded by Jim Steinman. He's mostly associated with Meat Loaf and Bonnie Tyler. He has a very Wagner-like sound, and he's often called the father of the power ballad. What makes this disc so dangerous is that the remixers took all of the steinman out of it. It's not even particularly good dance music, but by all means, for god's sake, DO NOT judge the writer of this song based on these recordings."
1,More like a Half-Star,"I agree with the reviews here that say this is a dissapointment, for it truly is. The remixes are horrible and have no charm or anything, and you can't even hear Celine! It is a dumb maxi single of a beautiful ballad! If you like this song, don't buy the Maxi single, you'll be really dissapointed, as well as I and many others have been."
3,well my grandson wanted it....,".....or I would not have bought it. He was thrilled to have it since on his wish list. I thought a bit pricey for what I got. But didn't read any product info, it was what he wanted."
3,"valuable ideas, poorly presented","He should have a better author present his ideas. It is a needlessly painful read but worth it. If you want to make a difference in the world it's never going to be easy, so I still say you should read it."
1,Why not read a compenent author?,"Ms. Anderson starts by stating a popular lie: That Wicca is an ancient religion. She seems to confuse folk-lore and history in an alarmning way.Why not start with one of the ""classic"" ""Intro-to-Wicca"" texts, such as Cunningham, the Farrars, etc? They don't ask you to shell out money to buy a book that contains mostly blank pages!I'm alarmed at the people aparently reading this book of mis-information and thinking, ""This is Wicca"". I would far prefer that newcomers to the faith started with an author who has actually done some research and knows what they're talking about."
1,Incorrect Picture,"I got one of these as a gift and had to ""regift"" it in an emergency. I bought this one to replace it. Alot of the photos I saw advertising it showed it in a rectangular box, the one I gave away was square and that's what I wanted so I went with this advertisement since it shows a square box. Well, it arrived and it's the rectangular box. I have no idea if there's a difference in the 2 games but it doesn't matter, it wasn't what I thought I was buying. I'm very disappointed so I guess I'll have to give this one away and keep looking for the one I ordered!"
3,Avid Reader,It was a short read...mostly a memoir with a few basic recipes. I was disappointed that there were not more recipes.
3,Mission San Fernando Rey de Espana,"Mission San Fernando Rey is a hairsplitting book. It talks through the discovery of the place where the Mission was built, then the establishment, the population there, and all through the years. One thing I really liked about it was that it quoted a lot from journals and letters. It gives a even more precise understanding of what happened then.But since this book was published in 1927, before World War II, which changed California a lot, many things might be considered ""wrong"" nowadays. For example, racism wasn't as big of a problem then, and the author's point of view on the Native Americans are definetly believed to be racist.So why did I give this book 3 stars? Well, I would've given it 3.5 stars if I had the choice. Like I said, this book is very detailed and a very good resource, but the point of view is very different from what we have learned. Overall, this book is a very nice book to read, and I enjoyed it."
4,CHEST Protector,"I would just like to point out that it is described and sold as a CHEST protector and not a TORSO protector. The difference is that this protects your chest and upper torso. It leaves the lower mid-riff exposed. (As someone who uses a remote air system and pods on a belt which covers this area anyway, I see this to be a plus).I like the material used, I usually play outdoors and even under the sun I don't feel overwhelmed; it breathes well for a vest with such stopping power."
3,"Well Constructed, but way too short!","PROS:This chest protector is well constructed of strong materials and light weight.Good price.CONS:Way too short, i'm only 5'5"" and its even too short on me, could be 3 or 4 inches longer to protect your lower back and stomach."
4,Work Great!,"It's great, no major problems. My brother was hit in the chest, he said he felt nothing but a slight push. The only downfall to it is if your harness doesnt come up high enough cause it doesnt cover from your belly button down. Besides that it works great. Easy to adjust to any one's build!"
4,Very Useful.,"I bought this vest a while back, it work very good. the shipping time was very very fast I had no idea it was gonna come that fast.. it is pretty comfortable so I recommend it."
5,Great Book in like new cond,"This was a real find, especially knowing it came from Goodwill !! Mr Christian is my all time favorite photographer of The Tahitian Islands, his photos are breathless to look at. I was very happy to locate one of his books on Amazon and will be keeping an eye out for others he has published. Book was extremely well cared for. Thanks Goodwill !!"
5,Great book,Love this book. Helps identify what conflict is and ways we all handle conflict. Written in a very user friendly way.
3,A supplementary tool,"This is not a solutions manual to the ""Brief Introduction to Fluid Mechanics"" textbook, but rather solutions to supplemental questions for each section in the book. It's kind of nice to have some extra practice, but otherwise not really necessary."
3,"Works well, but so does a rubber band","This product does work well at keeping cables organized, but there wasn't much advantage over a typical rubber band. Granted, these aren't terribly expensive, and they do have a little black rod as a locking mechanism, but if you're debating this purchase you might want to stick with rubber bands instead."
1,Deserves Zero Stars...Russ Meyer is Spinning in his Grave,"This movie is an abomination. How they tried to cash in on Russ Meyer's greatness is despicable. The film has nothing -- I repeat: nothing -- to do with Russ Meyer. The actresses are over weight cellulite trash, the writing is abysmal, the direction is fourth rate.I was looking forward to a true homage to Meyer and got vomit-producing junk. I am convinced the ""good"" reviews were put there by people involved with the film, because no one in their right mind could think this waste of time was any good.Please stay away. You have been fore warned."
5,happy girl jumping,"product arrived in excellent condition - dvd had no scratches,cover pic was perfect and dvd box was also in great condition.did not watch it yet - but cover reminds me a little of a Russ Meyer movie."
1,Ineffective Porn,"As a 32 y/o male, I appreciate visual depictions of anything sex related as much as the next guy. However, this was just stupid. It was so over the top cheesy that the annoying side effects caught more of my attention than the nudity. Besides, if you're considering this movie for the nudity, save yourself the annoyance and peruse those websites that require you to verify your age (and not on your work computer of course).Also, perhaps I'm not old enough to appreciate the 70s exploitation film homage. I understand that this was supposed to be a major element of the film design. Again, though, it just came off as stupid, and I so desperately want to avoid using such a pedantic, mundane word, but it really captures the unfortunate essence."
2,Unbiased?,"This book is totally biased; that is, in favor of the ""Church"" of $cientology. It has a fairly decent treatment of the ""Church's"" ""theology"" (which is drug hazed sci-fi), but the slant is totally pro-$cientology. Melton (who spoke in favor of $cientology a few yrs. back on an A&E documentary re: $cientology) portrays this cult as a victim of unfair assaults.Definitely not worth the price. A Piece of Blue Sky and L Ron Hubbard Messiah or Madman may also be biased, but are written by authors with first-hand knowledge of the cult.Remember this: The ""Church"" of $cientology is the only ""church"" with a cash register you could probably ever enter ! Chu-ching!!"
2,More entertaining than listening to seagulls screech,"I used to be afraid of dwarves. But thanks to L. Ron Hubbard, I am now only afraid of things that come out of my butt. While this fear has grown more intense, I have a strange urge to buy all of Tom Cruise's movies on DVD including ""Legend"" in order that I might play them backwards to reveal a secret message. The message being L. Ron Hubbard's address, so I will know where to mail my check. Speaking of which, I think BattleField Earth with John Travolta got a bum rap. It was slightly more painful than placing one's testicle in a garlic press and squeezing. So just ask homeschoolmum, L. Ron Hubbard is in fact our savior. On Easter we celebrate his birth and best works of fiction like Dianetics. On Christmas, we spend lots of money on his products and give them to fellow pagans. It's not like any of us would dare give ""Blue Lagoon"" on DVD to another scientologist. So do you think Brooke Shields turned Tom Cruise down?"
1,"Melton ? A most biased ""author"" writing for criminal cults","I can't possibly believe that Melton is still on the road with whatever rants about criminal cults he does.Meklton, together with his friend Massimo Introvigne of the CESNUR, is one of the topmost biased ""authors"" having been published on religions and CULTS -his speciality is criminal cults, that he recommends to anyone.The only fact that your could read scientologists ""reviews"" putting a 5stars on his books is enough to assess the truth contained in his works.roger gonnet"
4,Solid Rock N Roll Fury,"The Datsuns rip right into their debut album with a lot of ferocity, but at the same time the music has an abandoned glee that makes it the kind of music you want to go drag racing or get into a bar fight to, just for the hell of it.It's one of those albums I didn't take a shine to outright. I listened to it twice a few months ago when I got it, then recently gave it another go and WOW, this album is simply terrific.Sure, it's got a 70's retro vibe fueled with some riffs that might make Lars Ullrich proud, but although THE DATSUNS may share a genre with some of its predessessors and contemporaries, it's certainly not deriviative of them or ""trying to be"" (as one of the truly adolescent reviews on this site suggests) anything but rough and tumble rock and roll"
4,A Good Rockin' Band,The Datsuns arrive in the nick of time to show of their loud rock noise to change the tides of the music nation. Many of these reviewers don't give the credit that they deserve. With The Datsuns you can definately see some definate influences for old rockers such as Led Zeppelin which isn't a bad thing at all. These guys are doing their own thing in the whole Rock N' Roll genre. These guys are orignal from the stand point they aren't like a few bands where you can hear definate riffs from their prodecessors (ie. Jet). The solos are nothing short of decent quality and have some power that really add to the songs. Though short they are very good. I couldn't choose a favorite song if I tried I just like driving around in my car with this blasting because hey I will probably be the only one playing this band. Overall The Datsuns are a great underplayed and underhyped band that deserve the credit they deserve.
3,Turbo Negro Hates the Kids...,"I would've given this cd more stars if the Hellacopters or Fu Manchu or Mudhoney had never existed (or hadn't done it better), but they do a good job of recreating what makes the aforementioned bands so good: namely imitating AC/DC, Blue Cheer and Motorhead, and how could you not love that from a country where the best they could come with was Crowded House/The Split Enz? While I wouldn't put this in my top twenty, it still deserves a regular listen, especially if you're planning on any extended state of intoxication."
2,Miss-guided,"The energy is great and so to is the T-Rex inspired 'Harmonic Generator,' but the we-want-to-be-the-next-Led-Zepplin is just plain sad. Who aspires to be average? They have to decide if it's T-Rex or Led Zep. Until then the jury is still out."
2,45 minutes of tedium and then a halfway decent twist,"Stop me if you've heard this one before. A group of buddies head for a cabin in the woods, their car breaks down and now a killer is picking them off one by one.I was ready to turn this off when I realized we were down to the last girl and still had a half hour to go. There'd been no thrills, a bit of gore, a bit of nudity but really nothing to write home about.But then, with about 30 minutes to go the movie abandoned the formula. The killer ""Big Stevie"" breaks character and starts chatting, and things get weird.It's not enough to redeem this by the numbers slasher flick, but at least it's something."
1,out of gas,"As the elite of contemporary typograhpy will tell you, Art Director David Carsons was neither type designer nor graphic designer, but instead adept collector of typefaces and free favors from young talent. This book is an attempt, on the eve of the sellout of the Ray Gun Empire, to solidify the merit of a magazine built on 2 things: hype, and the desire of the design community and its afficionados to find a voice for the explosion of creativity ignited by the early macintosh design pioneers and their disciple, Ed Fella,while, initially at least, disregarding the need for relevant indie music reporting. Don't buy it."
5,"Great product, works with my new ipod touch","I just hooked this up to my '05 Civic (this product was made in '05, so it doesn't list the '05's as compatible, but the price was so low, I took the risk as most ipod adaptors cover 1998-2005 but cost $50 with shipping on ebay). I use my ipod in the car for audiobooks, which download as a playlist, so you use the disc+/- controls on the radio to go through playlists. If you have problems, you can start the song/playlist prior to plugging in, the when you plug in the playlist/song will continue. Only downside is that this will not charge the newer ipods with different voltage requirements. Again, overall, well worth it to have the direct radio connection without the issues associated with an FM modulator."
2,Noxall vegitation killer,"This stuff is waaaaay overprices for the amount of area it covers, plus within 4 months i had weeds again. Im stickin to the liquid stuff"
2,Not as Good as I wanted,"but, it finally killed the area after applying way room than I thought I would need. We shall see it weeds come back in the spring."
2,"Good opera, terrible voices.","The earlier recording of this opera was sung passably (barely) and had little personality.This recording has much more personality and far worse voices. The edition used certainly doesn't follow my piano vocal score, and they are both listed as ""Pavel Lamm Edition."" (The earlier recording altered things, too.)I have already given this recording to a library. I realized I couldn't stand to listen to it beyond the first time. The production value of sound alone gives it 2 stars, but nothing much else preserves this as a memorable recording."
4,Christmas Hope,"Good movie, it just not as good as the Christmas Shoes movie. I thougth this was ""part 2"" of that movie but it wasn't. I would still recommend."
4,Wonderful Heartfelt Movie,"Wonderful movie well worth watching! However, think of it as a separate movie from Christmas Shoes and Christmas Blessing because it does not relate to the other two. It was a heartfelt movie about family, love, hope, and rebirth."
4,Loved It !!,"This movie will put the magic of Christmas Spirit in your hearts for sure . It will make you see that no matter how bad things are for you , there are others who are worse and how you can still help them find a way to enjoy everyday life."
2,Disappointing sequel,"This is NOT the same movie really. First off, the actors are different and then the storys just isn't near as good. I am very disappointed and wouldn't have gotten this product had I known."
3,Blues Creation - 'Live! In The Beginning' (Avex Trax) 3 1/2 stars,"Show took place on August 7, 1971 at the All Japan Folk Jamboree. Reason I'm giving this archive CD a 3 1/2-star rating is beacuse I thought the sound quality of this live performance is pretty good. Liked the thirteen-minute opener ""Rolling Stone"", as well as ""Nightmare"" and the rocking ""Atomic Bombs Away"". Also didn't mind the all-too often played by too many other (bands already) ""Baby Please Don't Go"". As huge of a live album nut I've always been - I still like their main lp's the self-titled Blues Creation and 'Demon And Eleven Children' a bit more."
5,Annette Hanshaw Is a Gem!!!,"I find Annette Hanshaw's singing incredible. Did she have a great voice? It doesn't matter to me because she is so easy to listen to and one CD wasn't enough for me. While this is a superb collection and I love ASV/Living Era's array of splendid music from the 20s and 30s, I still needed more of Annette's recordings. What a pity that she stopped recording in 1934. Her 78s have been found and put on CDs and they sound fantastic because of the feeling she puts into her singing. This is an especially good one to be introduced to her music since it has a bit of all her recordings from 1926-1934. I easily give it five stars. I prefer her over Ruth Etting and that says a lot!!!"
4,"Great toy, bad price!","My 3 year old LOVES Diego so I thought this would be the perfect toy for him. While he does like it, and the animal rescue baby jaguar is great for role playing, he's not completely wowed by it (He would have been just as happy with the $5 beenie baby Baby Jaguar). That said, I don't feel too badly about the purchase b/c I only paid $19 (at Toys-R-Us)...the list price here on amazon is insane ($119)."
3,I've read better and worse,"I never really cared for any of the books I read by Jane Yolen (there are a few exceptions, such as Commander Toad), and I include this book as one of them. The plot seemed to lack something, and I finished the book with a vaugely dissatisfied feeling. I would've given it two-and-a-half stars if I could've"
3,Young Arthur and an old dragon,An ancient dragon teaches young Arthur some valuable lessons. I have enjoyed Yolen's other fantasy and dragon books better.
3,disapointing ending,"i have liked the other books by this author, but this one was disipointing. The story leads up to a suspensful climax but the ending is HORRIBLE.I enjoyed the book untill the end. it wasn't very well explained, as if the author was in a hurry to finish"
3,It's an ok book but I didn't like it to well,"Ok its a pretty good book. I really LOVE dragons so when I seen this book I was really excited.When you first start to read it it sounds great with adventures and all but the ending was VERY BAD. I won't tell you why cause that would ruin the book.I guess it just denping on what kind of book you like I really don't recommed this book to people how think they know what happens at the end- cause its not as you think, (unless you like that stuff). So just read it for yourself."
2,Not what I expexted,The book is more about J.P. Donleavy than it is about Ireland.It you want to know about Donleavy than this is the book.
4,Fun book,"My son likes this book a lot. This is a sweet bedtime story, and if your child likes a book with a ""gimic,"" this one will not dissapoint."
4,Great for solar,This little pump works great for solar. I happen to have a spare 64 watt panel to run it but I think 20w would be about right. I have a 10 w panel that doesn't have enough oomph for it.
4,Good pump,"I'm on my second one of these, they're quite good pumps, but my first one went bad because there was some debris in my boat which clogged it up, by the time i noticed (an hour or so of it running, jammed) i cleaned it out and it was shot. so if you dont let bits of leaves and stuff go into it, they work great."
4,Bilge pump for fountains,"We use this pump as a safe feature for several water fountains in our patio and gardens. Running 12 vdc to these is much safer than using typical 110 vac fountain pumps. And they last about a year running 10 hours a day, sometimes running dry. By hooking them up to a variable-voltage power supply from Radio Shack, we can vary the flow to get exactly what we want. Yes, I wish they lasted longer but they are cheap and as long as you hook them up in a way that is easy to replace, they are worth the one hour a year to replace them. Good product."
1,Why Do I Want To Read About Dash's Experience In The Hood?,"Very unlike Rosa Lee, in that this book reads like an account of Dash's experiences rather than a telling of the young women's stories. He did well abandoning this approach in Rosa Lee."
4,pretty darn good...,"It's difficult to believe this album was out of print for 30 years prior to its 1998 reissue, especially given Carole King's popularity in the 70's. This is for all intents and purposes her first solo album - she co-wrote and sings lead on all but one of the songs. Stylistically, it's closer to _Tapestry_ than many of the albums she released after it. The arrangements are pretty organic (guitar, bass, keyboards, drums), and there's a sort of late 60's optimism and enthusiasm here that is refreshing. Of course, top to bottom, it doesn't quite match up to the aforementioned 1971 masterpiece, but ""Wasn't Born to Follow"", ""Victim of Circumstance"", ""Hi-de-Ho"", and the title cut are all excellent, and ""Snow Queen"" is a standout. Danny Kortchmar's vocal turn on ""Man Without a Dream"" is also quite enjoyable."
5,KATE CHOPIN,Emily Toth does a very good job writing about Kate Chopin's life and writing career. I was delighted to learn that a biography had been written and it did not disappoint.
5,Lyrical,"I can't understand why this book has gone out of print. I love it because it's so lyrical, and my preschooler loves it because it teaches about counting, days of the week, and nature. Bring it back into print! My softcover edition can't take much more scotch tape."
4,EATS BATTERIES!!!!!,"This is an adorable little lantern and my daughter was excited to get it for her 3rd birthday. It's easy to operate and I thought it would be perfect for her to take to bed at night. She used it on and off for ONE day (I'm guessing a total of about 4-5 hours) and the batteries were dead. So even with more limited use, say, an hour every night, I would have to change the batteries more than once a week. This $9.99 lantern could get really expensive."
5,Excellent,"These enveloped are just the right size for general mailings, durable with the bubble wrap inside and the type material used outside i would think is water repellent vs. those brown paper enveloped. The seal is extremely tight and a great value for the price. I would highly recommend these envelopes over the brown paper ones that are being sold, and again they are a perfect size for most shipments."
4,Fit the need,"Utilize this product to ship not easily damaged goods. Overall they work well, I feel the inner protection is somewhat lacking but they suite the need."
2,Hard to write on package,"I purchased this product to ship cell phones out in. The packaging is very hard to write on and smudges a lot.If you print all your labels this product would be fine. However, if you hand write you shipping information I would not recommend this product."
4,What a deal!,At first I was surprised at the price but I kept thinking that I might as well at least give them a try. When they came (and they came in the time frame promised) I was at first taken back that they seemed kind of flimsy. But I've been using them for mailing CD's that I sell for several weeks now with no problems or complaints from my customers. What I have been doing is adding a piece of cardboard in the mailer the size of the CD to give it a little extra stability. However at .25 each I will most certainly purchase them again.
5,6x10 Mailers,"I purchased this product to use as mailers for Scentsy catalogs and samples, the size is perfect. The mailers are white and blank which is exactly what I wanted. Good price for the product, I would purchase these again."
4,Great mailers,"Perfect for sending VHS or DVDs to your customers. Self-seal works well, I don't use any additional tape.If you sell online, buy your mailers in bulk."
3,Okay...but not why I purchased them!,"Purchased these bubble mailers after reading reviews of previous buyers using them to ship CD's. The packaging looked very flimsy and needed to be folded down when shipping single CD's, it didn't look great. I didn't have luck and ended up purchasing the cardboard mailers."
3,Good for the price.,"Padded plastic mailers work very well. Flap adhesive works great. Note: This holds standard DVD's that come in a standard DVD plastic case, but it will not hold the older releases that came in that cardboard case with plastic edge snap. Those are a little too wide."
1,Terrible quality,"I thought I could use these to ship collectible blu-rays and DVDS, but no go. These are flimsy envelopes and the bubble interior peels up with even the slightest pressure, offering very little protection to the objects inside. I'd think twice about using them without reinforcing it with cardboard. The seller I got them from was one of many on the list (we're not supposed to specify), though I'm pretty sure all of them sell the same product."
4,Recommends against three great foods!,"Tea, chocolate (i.e. unsweetened cacao), and pork are all nutritious foods which Levy recommends against, sometimes not even giving a reason, other times cherry picking from among numerous conflicting findings. On the positive side, he does give an easy-to-follow summary of several complex issue, including differential rates of digestion of different types of macro-nutrients (protein, carb, fat)."
5,A powerful tale,"A well-told story that will make a grown man cry. The illustrations are glorious, bold and magical. The themes are timeless: self-denial, love and perseverance."
3,Cliched,"This collection contains the first 2 books from a projected trilogy. The book contains some fantastic action sequences and some decent plot twists. However, a lot of the events are extremely derivative. For example, large sections have apparently been lifted straight from the Star Wars franchise - a prohesied hero, a virgin birth; even George Lucas himself appears as a Philistine.There are also too many central characters, as the plot shift between perspectives. This means that the action is sometimes difficult to follow."
2,Disappointing game,I heard so many good things about this game so i went and paid 60 of my hard earned dollars on this game. I personally think the game is awful. I myself am a pretty good singer but this game got boring after 10 minutes. I am looking to trade it in already because i cannot see myself ever playing it again. I hate being disappointed.
4,Karoake Revolution is surprisingly fun,"I've 'performed' karaoke and number of times but my wife has never considered singing on stage a suitable option. So I was hesitant when we opened up the game (it was a gift) but after singing a few songs we realized we were having a good time.There's a good choice of music and only a few that we didn't know. The cartoony characters are fun to watch as a performer or audience. And the performance meters seem to be more accurate than I liked!It would be nice to have a duet mode. And hopefully the expansion disks aren't too expensive. I'm pretty sure we'll get one.This isn't like a game of Madden that can be played, realistically, eight hours a day (if given the choice...) but when played on occasion, Karaoke Revolution is a fun time."
5,Fun and good practice!,"This game just isnt about getting up and singing in front of everyone. This game actually ""teaches"" you to sing. It will let you know when you need to raise the tone of your voice or lower it. Very helpful and fun to try to hit that perfect note. Characters fun and many unlockables of more characters, outfits, videos, outtakes, etc. I hear the expansion cd (of more songs and characters) is coming out in September of 2004. Even though the current songs are nice you go through them quicker the you would think and now (Feb 2004) I have to wait forever for the expansions. I would actually recommend waiting on this product a little while or you'll go through withdrawls while you wait for more songs ;) Great game though! Good for parties and get togethers.P.S. If you suck at singing you can turn your voice down and just do the raising and lowering of the tone of your voice. Fun and nobody can hear you.... (except dogs)"
3,Great fun for VOCALISTS - Not so much fun for casual party gamers,"Both I and my wife love the DDR style games and we thought this would be a fun blast for parties etc. My wife is a trained vocalist so I knew she would rock on gameplay, but heck, even I used to sing in a variety of garage bands. These games rely STRICTLY on pitch variations...which really stinks for people like me who can't seem to hit some of the high notes (or sustain them). It was very disappointing to not be able to pass a song by ""singing"" the correct words with the correct timing....most songs you can simply ""hum""out loud and pass the stages.I was looking for a simple fun party game, not vocal training. while my wife still loves them I can't recommend them for everyone. Unless you have a high pitched/tone vocal style or have a musical background you will probably be disappointed."
2,Did not fit right,I orderd this product after reading some of the reviews. I received it very fast but the cutouts did not match my dash. They seemed to be a inch or so off. I think it shoud be a little longer in the front as well. Also did not receive the velcro with it.
1,Wrong Car,"I ordered a mat for my '06 Mustang. When I pulled it out of the box it looked all wrong. Further investigation revealed the mat I had been sent was for a Dodge Truck. I would have given the mat a higher rating had I been allow to EXCHANGE the mat for the correct one but this is not an option. Your only option is to return the item for a refund, the refund was relatively quick and easy. Rather than try again I chose to check a local auto parts store and found the same mat at a much lower cost BUT the shipping time was nearly two weeks."
3,dashmat,"orderd two of these. specified what cars they were for, and guess what, they sent me two of the same for ONE car. its annoying when i have to send stuff back and wait again for the product."
2,Does not fit correctly.,This dash mat does not fit our dash. Some of the cut outs are correct but many are just a little off. This item will be returned.
2,There are better ones out there,"I guess it all depends on what you are used to. I have the complete set of Mozart's piano concertos with Brendel/Marriner and some of the Perahia recordings. Compared with those I found this interpretation lacking finesse and spirit. I missed the differential and almost spiderweb-like lightness of Perahia's and also Bendel's keystroke, and Marriners or Perahias conducting seems for my ears to be more interesting as well. Certainly, this is a fine recording with no technical flaws - however, I found it uninspired and partially even boring (which you might consider a major flaw). As conclusion - I think there are better recordings out there."
3,"Pretty pictures, Little substance","Reading this travel guide makes me want to visit the U.S. Virgin Islands but does not give me all of the specifics on how to do it. The pages are adorned with beautiful pictures of this Caribbean paradise which make for great viewing. However, noticably missing are such essential items as comprehensive coverage of hotels, their prices, and detailed maps. It reads like a novel, great for daydreaming on my front porch, but leaves me looking elsewhere to make the plans for my trip."
1,More like a Pre Study Guide,"This is a good book to use if you have never had any experience with security. It's kind of like a GSEC for Dummies. Read this book, and then take the SANS course, and use their materials to prepare for the exam. The SANS course is such an amazing program that really teaches you everything you need to know to not only create the company security policy, but how to set everything up and manage it. Logical and Hands on."
1,No where near adequate coverage for the test.,"Having read through this book and fully utilizing the practice test I have to say that this book has about 10% to 25% relevance to the material you will actually be tested on. I am so glad that I have years of practical experience, attended the SANS classes and have the original SANS Material.The tests were not easy and do require you to have intimate knowledge of the material you are being tested on.This book and the CD of practice questions were a complete waste of time and effort."
3,Okay movie,"This is a nice little Christmas movie. Unfortunately, it didn't hold my interest, but I'm sure there a folks who will enjoy it."
2,Not good,My family loves holiday films. I tried watching The Dog Who Saved Christmas with the kids and couldn't force myself to finish it. Within 15 minutes they were up running around too. A 2 and 4 year old weren't interested. Not for us.
3,Cute movie,"I enjoyed this movie and found it to be entertaining. I watched it with my husband and in spite of having read the bad reviews here prior to watching it, we turned out to actually like this movie.It's definitely not the greatest film you will ever see, but as far as being an entertaining, warm, light-hearted Christmas movie, it fits the bill on all fronts. I was shocked at how much this movie lifts the storyline from Home Alone and if you're familiar with that film, you will notice it.I'd love to give this 4 stars, but it just doesn't quite rise to that level, so I'll give it 3, which means ""OK"".If you're looking for a family film that you can feel comfortable putting on no matter who may be visiting around the holidays, this would be a good one to try."
4,Fun and heartwarming,"This is a fun film to watch with your family at Christmas time. No it won't win Oscars, but it will leave you feeling good. Lots of times that's what I really want. I will watch this one every year."
3,Meant for the young kids....,"Well, it's a cute movie. Reminds me of Home Alone. Don't expect great acting, or believability. It's a nice holiday picture that the younger kids would enjoy. The premise is a bit far-fetched, and who heard of a dog who doesn't bark because of past 'trauma.' But, hey, it's the plot.Overall, it is a good family-oriented, feel good movie about a pound dog saving the day for a family that was about to send him back. Of course, he now becomes the hero of one and all.Would I recommend it? Yes, it depends on the audience, but it is a nice movie. Just lower those expectations and go along for the ride."
3,Doggie Style Home Alone,"I give this movie 3 stars because my 10 year old did like it, some. She said it was ok, not great, not horrible. It's like Home Alone but instead of starring a kid, it stars a dog. I really didn't care for the movie at all, but since this movie is geared more towards kids is why I went with my daughters feeling on the movie instead of my own. There's really not much more I can add that others haven't already said about the movie. My daughter did say she would probably watch it again next holiday season."
4,Great family movie,"It's incredibly hard review a product like this due to its simplicity. Simply stated, this is a great family movie for the holidays. However, it is corny at times but completely safe for kids. Of course, this movie was on TV over the holidays so the main advantage to having the DVD is the uninterrupted viewing (commercial free). Other than that, the movie kept the kids attention the entire time and that is a good sign."
1,Horrible movie,I don't see how anyone of any age would enjoy this 88 min waste of time. Don't waste your time or money. I saw it for free on ABC Family and felt like I was robbed.
2,"OK FOR KIDDIES, BUT ADULTS SHOULD LEAVE THIS ONE TO THE DOGS!","Hooboy! I am more than a little tired of talking animals.....at least in live action films and this entry just seems a little too tired for me. The kids might enjoy this film, but adults will see this K-9 version of 'Home Alone' for what it is, a silly and boring gimmick film. I suggest a rental before buying this one. To each their own, but you have been warned."
1,Spend your money on something else,"This movie is bad. It's like someone with no experience or talent set out to make a family movie. The cover makes it look like Air Bud or Marley goes to Christmas. I am not a fan of those, but this does not even live up to that standard. I hate that people compare this to other movies in their review. I can't think of anything worse, and I pray I do not see the films that compare to it. (To day something positive) I am happy for the people that made the movie, it helps the economy that they have jobs.My mom bought it for my kids because the dog on the cover looks like our dog. It was sweet of her, but I pray other grandma's read this and save their money. There are plenty of better movies that will actually entertain people. No need to waste time with this one."
4,Hey... that looks familiar...,"I grabbed this for my kids to watch with their cousins while we were visiting family out of state for the holidays. I thought it would be a cute movie that would fit all ages (10-6). I was right! The kids loved it and talked about it off and on for several days afterwards with much laughter. That made it very special. My son told me that it was a lot like Home Alone.Recently, I was able to watch it and... yes, it's like Home alone - with a dog. As an adult, I thought it was just okay, but I'm rating it higher because the kids liked it so much and really, it's about them, ya know?This is good for people that are looking for a holiday film. It's pretty mild, so it would be fine for something for the adults to watch with the kids and everyone enjoy it, it's not too adult or too kid-oriented, so it fits the bill nicely.Worth a watch, but a familiar storyline :)"
1,Home Alone with a dog,"Just imagine the plot from Home Alone, but with a lovable dog with a painful past playing Macaulay Culkin's part. Yes, we have a couple bumbling burglars, a mysterious neighbor who turns out to be a good person. Now add in poor writing, over-acted parts, and talking dogs, cats, and mice that people can't hear. I wished I couldn't hear them either; the animal voices were no surprises; the French poodle had a fake French accent, the mice had high-pitched voices. The whole movie was predictable, and plodding.Worse yet, there are horrible role models: The father gets a dog from the pound after promising his wife he won't *BUY* a dog, the kids talk back to the parents, don't want to visit grandma on Christmas Eve, and the kids and parents try to sneak out of grandma's house when grandma falls asleep."
2,Made for TV movie,"I wasn't very impressed with this movie but my kids did stay tuned to it until the end. It's like a dog version of Home Alone. I would say it has the quality/effect of a ""Made for tv"" type movie which is not something that I usually want to buy or watch twice. The acting isn't that good but the kids didn't really notice. However, they did notice and point out that the dog characters' mouths do not move when they are ""talking"" and that bothered and annoyed them."
1,"""There's Gotta Be Somebody Out There Who Will Take Me Home""","Wow, this one may be good intentioned but it's really bad. It's kind of like watching a skit on Saturday Night Live (SNL), you know what I mean, one of those little parodies where everyone is trying their best not to laugh out loud at the absurdity of the storyline. Only in the case of 'The Dog Who Saved Christmas there's absolutely nothing funny to laugh about.Definitely not for adults but maybe something children (5 and under) might enjoy. I hope you don't spend any money on this dog (that's a pun)."
3,Nice gift item for the dog lover in your life,"""The Dog Who Saved Christmas"" was originally released as a televised movie on the ABC Family Network. Being a made for TV movie the production quality reflects its original medium but that said the video quality is decent enough that this shouldn't be an issue save for the most discriminating film buff.The story is a straight rip of 'Home Alone' but obviously geared for a dog loving audience. Mario Lopez does an adequate voice over performance as Zeus, the dog who saves the day. Most of the humor veers toward slapstick and silly gags and is perfectly appropriate for viewers of all age."
5,Great Christmas Movie,"I ordered this movie to be here for Christmas 2011. My grandchildren were going to be here and they had not seen this film. Needless to say, it was a good Christmas movie, and even my parents who are 88 and 84 years old enjoyed the movie. It's a family movie."
2,Did Not Enjoy It,"I really wanted to like this movie and it seemed to have stuff that I like. Christmas. Family. A family pet.Unfortunately that was not to be.I didn't care that the premise was already done. As the good king said ""There is nothing new under the sun"". What I did care about was that the jokes were not funny - too predictable and *they* were all done a thousand times before in a thousand movies that were better.And because I was bored before the first 15 minutes were up, I never got the connection to the movie, or any of characters that should have had me going ""awww"" at the appropriate times - which is all these movies really ask of the audience.So sorry that I didn't like it better."
1,This may be THE WORST CHRISTMAS MOVIE EVER!,"The writing was terrible, the acting even worse, the production values were cheap and cheesy, and the animal voiceovers were sub-idiotic. This is what I get for letting the wife pick the film for the night, I guess. (She didn't even like it.) The only question I had after the pain was over, aside from wanting the ninety minutes back, was how did such a dead-head family afford that house? The Father didn't act like he could possibly do anything that would put him in that income bracket. Perhaps he earned it the old fashioned way: he inherited it. Yet another argument for family planning."
3,A Dog saved Christmas,"I was so excited about getting this movie, it sounded so cute. Also who can resist Dean Cain, he's a great actor. But I was quite disappointed. It was very slow moving, with no surprises. You knew they were going to buy a dog. You knew the dog was going to save Christmas, so get to the point. It was very slow moving and very predictable. My suggestion is if you are going to watch the movie don't expect much and don't read the synopsis on the back cover of the DVD. It gives away too much. My mom said this was a ""Home Alone"" version except with a dog, except she would rather watch ""Home Alone""."
1,Don't Do It!!,"If you have kids 8 or under, they might like this. They MIGHT like it. Otherwise, this is the corniest, cheesiest, nonfunny comedy I have seen in years. I rented it for a buck, and I feel jipped. We fast forwarded it just to get to the end and say that we watched it. I would hate to see what it cost to produce this movie. I am guessing it was a little more than a home movie."
3,A great family film for pre-teens,"Some films are not made for certain age groups. If you have a sophisticated kid, this may not appeal to you. Having said that, this is an enjoyable film for the innocent.My kids laughed and laughed at the antics of Zeus, Cain and major bonehead assistant in their silent film inspired comedy sequences. Even the gullible father and mother add to the atmosphere of the feel good plot. This is simple, but good film-making.The Bannister family will make a good addition to any childs film collection. I would love to see Dean Cain take on an adult role soon."
4,Slow down!,"I listened to this audiobook CD while getting myself ready for the day, cleaning house, and driving.The information presented was read aloud by 2 interchangeable voices, one of them loud and intrusively projected and the other smooth and charismatic. I did not mind the loud voice after getting used to it, but I did not like the fast pace of the readings at all. The wording is definitely that of a textbook lacking character and personal relation. The topics have no particular order, lending me an unorganized feeling.What I liked a lot about this audiobook were the previews at the beginning of the topics and the reviews at the end of each topic."
1,Boring for baby,My 10 month old loved it at first until he touched it then it would stop moving. It would sit there until touched or tapped twice but by then my baby had knocked it over and so I had to baby sit the monkey for him to be able to have any play time. Love how it crawls where baby has to chase but doesn't go very far and not good for keeping baby occupied unless you want to chase the monkey too.
2,Keeps tipping over!,"I bought this toy for my just learning to crawl baby. She will ""chase"" it, tap on it barely and over it goes. I have to constantly straighten it up. Now if she was whacking on it, I understand. But even I just grabbing it like a baby would, over it goes on its back or stomach. A baby doesn't know how to put it right way up. But hey, maybe that is a lesson to be learned? Teach a baby to put it upright?"
1,Tipping Monkey!,"We purchased this toy for our 7M old. Like the previous reviews said, it is always on its back from tipping over! Many times the monkey actually moves toward the baby who then grabs it and knocks it over. Great concept but a waste of money."
3,It Helps!!,I bought this toy for my son when he was 6 months old. He wasn't crawling but when he saw the monkey he started to get on his hands and knees and rock back and forth. He just turned 7 months and he is still on his way and he loves the monkey sounds.
2,Disappointed in this toy!,I bought this for my 9 month old son (preemie adjusted age is 7 months). He just learned how to crawl and I thought this would help him. Either my son is too fast or the toy is too slow. He caught the money everytime and flung it across the floor. Once the monkey is laying on its back it can't move! The toy stayed upright for maybe 15 seconds at a time and then my son either caught it or it ran into something and fell over. Seems like it worked out well for the other reviewers... this was just my experience. One of the only toys in my life that I returned the next day after purchasing.
2,Not good for easily frightened children!,"I found this in the clearance aisle of a local store and bought it because my 9 month old son loved it in the box and loved the sounds it makes. He likes most toys and even ones that move and sing (unlike my 3 yr old daughter who is frightened if a toy even moves a tiny bit) so I thought he would love it. We got it home and out of the box and I turned it on. The monkey made its cute noises and started moving and my son let out a blood-curdling scream and jumped into my arms trying to get away from the monkey. I'm very disappointed, but we are going to try and get him acclimated to the toy by letting him be around it when it isn't on and maybe he'll enjoy it sometime. OR maybe I'll just be selling it or giving it away very soon."
2,top heavy - falls over to easily,"I agree with the first reviews - the concept of the monkey is really good but the design unfortunately flawed. Every time my son gets its hands on it it just topples over. So it does not serve its intended function at all. Overall, great concept poor execution."
2,"Cute Idea but falls short, literally...","This toy was purchased last Christmas for my 6 mos. old baby. This product has 2 major faults, in addition to its annoying chatter it falls all of the time making it a hassel. Needless to say, it currently sits unused in the toy box... the money would have been better served being placed in a savings account for a future date."
2,Enjoyed it until it broke,My daughter got this toy when she was six months old and she loved to watch the monkey. The problem was it broke after two weeks of gentle use. I'm not sure she would have liked it once she was more mobile anyway.
2,Don't waste your time with this one!,We were so excited to buy this for our 7 month old daughter who was learning to crawl. She got the monkey quickly and then the monkey would topple over. Not motivating or stimulating enough to keep her attention.
1,Awful...don't waste your money,"This was a total waste of money. It had such rave reviews I thought it was a must have for my then 9 month old to have to encourage crawling. This thing basically moves a few inches in one direction, turns and moves a few more inches. The only redeeming quality it the cute monkey noises it makes (although some might find those annoying.) It's not very sturdy, and falls over easily."
2,More thought should have gone into this one,"This is a fun idea, but once the baby starts to crawl after the monkey and touches it, the monkey falls over and is unable to get back up. You would have thought the manufacturers would have tested this on toddlers before hand!"
3,Scary Monkey,"I was out toy shopping with my 7 month old daughter who learned how to creep but not quite get the crawling motion all the way. When we picked the monkey up off the shelf she seemed to like it, but when we brought it home it was a completely different story! She freaked out when she realized it moved around and made monkey noises. I will put it away for a few days and try to introduce her to it again.After she went to bed my husband and I were testing it out. We think it's really a neat toy, but do not like that fact that it has a tendency to roll over and get stuck. It only happens a few times but after reading one person's comment about how her infant catches up to it, it may be a toy that gets quickly overgrown."
2,BORING,"This was given to my daughter as a birthday gift and even if she was younger than a year old, it still wouldn't be very good. All it did was startle her when it first started up and did nothing but waddle around, stop and turn and go in another direction with the same annoying monkey sound and music. Pretty boring. My daughter was already almost walking so it was too late to assist her in crawling, but it might encourage younger babies to get moving."
2,Would you please stop falling down!!,"My daughter who is 9 months old loves this toy, it's me who hates it!!! She loves the music and it moving, but it falls down every single time, that I am the one crawling after it to pick it up! I am now an excellent crawler! My daughter could already crawl when her grandad bought this, but if she couldn't, it would have been no help. If they could figure out the balance on it, it would be a great toy!"
4,Hilarous!,"This toy is hilarious! I love it and laugh at it as much or more as my six month old! The other reviewers are right in that it tips over easy. But it gets an ""A"" for having a high cute factor and I love the noise it makes. It's worth the money."
2,"Monkey ""Chase""?","This product amused me more than my 8-month old. The music and monkey sounds are funny--however, that's about the only good thing I can say. The monkey moves really slowly and even on wood, doesn't seem to provoke much interest in a ""chase"". I am a BIG fan of all things Fisher Price. This, however, was a $15 letdown..."
2,"Cute Idea, Badly Executed.","My 8 month-old son got this as a Christmas present. When we saw the toy in the box, I said it would be perfect for him. He can already crawl, but I thought it would be fun for him to have something to chase. Ha. First of all, as other reviewers have said, the toy just goes a short distance and then turns around and runs into him. It doesn't scare him, but it's not much fun either. Secondly, it takes a pretty specific motion to make it move again. He likes to swat at the arms, and that isn't enough to get it going. You have to tap the head. Third, when he does tap it hard enough to make it go, it just falls over. This toy keeps his attention for all of 30 seconds. Total waste of money. I give it 2 stars just because it's a cute idea. If they were to rework the toy and reintroduce it later with improvements, I'm sure it would be great."
2,Scares my baby,My daughter got this at 7 months old. I thought it was absolutly adorable and a great idea. She loved it until it turned directions and ran over her. She didn't get hurt just startled but it is so slow that she is just learning to crawl and catches it and then it runs over her with the wheels and she starts screaming and will have nothing to do with it for a long time. This is a continuos pattern that I have seen with her. She actually hates the toy and is scatred of it because it keeps running over her. I gave it 2 stars thoug because it hasn't hurt her in running her over just scares her. The wheels are made well and don't pinch the baby when it runs over them. I think that is a wonderful thing.
1,Broke after 2 months!,"My ""little monkey"" loved this toy when we first brought it home. She would crawl after it and laugh with delight over it. Unfortunately, she would knock the silly thing over everytime she touched it so we were constantly picking the thing back up again. Well, she loved picking it up by it's arm and now it won't ""walk"" anymore! The music stutters and doesn't play like it used to and there is no more movement. My daughter will pick it up and get excited when she hears the music, only to be disappointed when it won't move anymore. This toy stays at the bottom of the toy box now."
4,"Beautiful, almost Perfect","This is an absolutely beautiful watch, has great timekeeping, and is weighted nicely on your wrist. I traded a Tag New Link Chrono for this watch, and after a year, I'm really glad I did. There are some quirks which should be noted: At the bottom of the dial, it appears as if there is a slight flaw(like a scratch) on it. If you don't wear it for a few days, and the watch needs setting, get a toothpick to set the day(I've been told this so the case isn't scratched), also the crown is VERY hard to pull out. Set the day and date a day before the actual date, and roll the minutes around to the proper date. All this takes about 3 minutes."
4,Brought back memories.,I grew up on the western. My father loved the Wild Wild West and I always watched it wth him. I feels good to see Jim and Arte riding again. I hope the books keep coming.
4,Let's do it again,"If you enjoyed the show, you will have a terrific time as you read this book. Ignore all of the ramblings of the other reviewers upset over technicalities and get ready to have some fun. The characters and the story came to life for me and I hope it does for you too!"
3,A good read that is reasonably faithful to the series.,"Perhaps my favorities of the western stories have been those which are sort of a cross between science fiction, adventure, and the old west. ""The Wild, Wild West"" and ""Briscoe County, Jr."" are two great exampls of that sort of story from TV.The book read smoothly, and although, in some places, there was just a touch too much foreshadowing, one expects this from a book that is based in a TV universe. I thought it was reasonably faithful to the TV show. Neither Jim nor Arte did anything I would not have expected them to. And the overall plot was interesting, technology was more or less appropriate and applied in a reasonable manner.This sort of thing appeals to me. I look forward to the next one."
4,A very exciting old fashioned Western.,"WWW was a very good book. Vaughan made Jim West and Artemus Gordon just as likable as the TV show. The gadgets were good, but I thought Jim West would woo a girl since he is quite the ladies' man. I thought Artemus Gordon's disguises were better described in this book than in the TV show. Overall the book was filled with action, backstabbing, gadgets, and likable characters."
3,Legend Deserves Better,"Maurice Chevalier was one of the great 20th century singers. His career spanned 4 decades, first and foremost as a singer, later as a film star. His songs ran the gamut from upbeat and fun to sweet and sensitive to bawdy. His biggest hit in the U.S. was ""Louise"" although many will be familiar with ""Oh, that Mitzi!"".This CD, I felt did not do him justice. First, most of the songs are his re-recorded English versions rather than the original French. Although very good, he is much stronger in his native tongue and the English versions lack a certain 'oomph'.Second, the sound quality is poor. The arrangements on his songs were so beautiful and you really have to strain to hear. It's just too scratchy and noisy.It's a shame that such a beautiful and legendary singing voice can't somehow be enjoyed today not through any weakness of his own work but lack of technological effort. If you are looking for one CD of his finest to enjoy again and again, I do not recommend this."
2,Over-rated photographs!,"As a university professor of geology, I received a promo post card raving about the photographs in this book (""Probably the best in any book on geology"" etc.) The reviewers can not have seen a production copy - these photographs are muddy and fuzzy - very disappointing! I feel I have been had!The text is OK, although the author uses terms like ""geosyncline"" that most of use discarded years ago because of the changed interpretations that came with the plate tectonics revolution of the 1960s.If you really want coffee-table quality geological photographs, there are a number of text books in physical geology out there that fit the bill (I like Tarbuck and Lutgens, for example) although the prices are double that of this book. I am reminded of the old expression ""If it seems too good to be true at the price then it probably is."""
4,Delaware is Representing!!,"I did enjoy this book. I will be reading more from ""The Prince of the Pen"" Thanks for the book Leondrei. I will be reading more of your books."
3,A review of Artificial General Intelligence,"If you are interested in human-level artificial intelligence you probably should own this book. I liked reading the book and am glad I own it but there are criticisms. Most of the book is too qualitative. Even where prototype software has been deployed algorithms are not given, even in pseudocode. Too much of the book is speculation. I also think that too little attention has been paid to the control of complexity."
2,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,The game at first looks promising but as you go through the first level you will not get much more then that. Of course you'll learn a new move as you progress but nothing to boost about. The worse parts of the game is the repeating vocal lines as they fight. Which you'll hear over and over. Limited fighting moves. The awful camera angles that will not let you see that might be ready to attack you. The only highlight is to see the short cartoon clips that are between each level.
4,OMG WTF WHY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"OK let me get this strait first........this game is a great game for kids even though i never got past stage 2 thats not the point... This game has good graphics for 2003 or four i cant remember but its a typical, well not typical but a beat em' up. The way TMNT should be.... KICK ASS!!!! But when I got to the end of the game and beat shredder, (SPOILER ALERT) For those who havent beaten it. All shredder does is falls off the building... WHAT A PIECE OF S*** I EXPECTED MORE WHAT A S***LOAD OF F***!!! Besides that theres that level with the mutant people..... hard as all hell but not as hard as stage 6 OMG that was so f***ing hard I had to change the difficulty... So yes if youre looking for a good game to keep you occupied for the time being get this it will hold up. If youre looking for a boxoffice hit type of game you wont find it here... I still havent bought the second one yet im like dieing to get it!!!! is it any good????"
5,THE GAME IS FANTASTIC,"The graphics are very good and the game is awesome. Everyone who gets this videogame will have fun for a long long time. But I have a question, Why you put this NGC game in a NEOGEO page? Please someone from Amazon answer this question"
1,Worst game on the Cube,"I wish that instead of insulting us 80's children they could do some justice for such a great series. This game was Final Fight, minus all cool combos and awesome boss fights. Audio clips were minimal and repetative. Cutscenes were poorly animated, if at all. Boo"
4,excellent,"this is great awesome action/adventure game. if u think ur too old for teenage mutant ninja turtles thats fin, but the game is awesome. great graphics and action. four people can play at the same time! all i hab to say is that this game is the bomb."
2,This is NOT the turtles I knew?,"I was looking forward to playing the new turtles game because like a few others on here, I grew up with the turtles from the 80's. Now I am a HUGE fan of changing stories up and making things more interesting, but these turtles were cheesy!!!The boss fights in the Arcade version and other turtle games were FAR more exciting and a lot less repetitive. I played the game through and recognized only about 2 enemies from the original: Shredder and Stockman. Who are these other people?? And why is April and Casey this white-trash couple now??!!Anyway, the gameplay was good and so were the graphics, but if you think you are getting old school turtles...RUN FAR AWAY.P.S Whats with the new theme song??? GeeZZZZ"
4,A wonderful but poorly-titled book,"Mr. Cawthorn and Mr. Moorcock do an excellent job of providing something of a running narrative of fantasy, highlighting books which jump-started notable genres such as Gothic, High Fantasy, Sword & Sorcery, and Urban Fantasy.That said, I think this book might have done better to not imitate its Newman/Jones horror counterpart, and be titled 'A History of Fantasy' or some such. There are a number of books which the two admit are absolutely dreadful reading (like the infamous Castle of Otranto) but have been included because of their importance to the genre.Enjoy the reading, but don't take an inclusion as necessarily a sign of a book's quality."
2,review of reviews,"I thought this was a list of the books, and contained the books themselves, but it is just a list of reviews of the books, not the books themselves."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Moorcock and Cawthorn take a look at a list of books. The book itself is around 200 pages, which is basically a couple of pages of trivia, info, book summary and information for each of the 100 titles listed.He starts with Jonathan Swift, and ends in De Camp Land, and others, by way of Merritt, Lovecraft, Howard, Poe, etc.A reasonably flexible definition of fantasy, from Flatland to Black Magic."
5,THE BEST PRODUCT EVER!,"I have used Balmex since my children were small...EXCELLENT for diaper rash, insect bites, burns, itching...ANY skin irritation. Works better then A&D, Vaseline, Zinc Oxide etc. We go no where without a tube in our luggage! It has become a household staple!"
4,If my baby could talk,"If my baby could talk I bet she would say that she likes this product. I also have Destin, A+D and Welda's calendula baby cream. She has never had a diaper rash (I use pampers free and natural diapers) and I apply one of the creams above in rotation every other change as needed. Call me a crazy mom- I think we all are!"
3,make sure you're buying a new one,"When I purchased this item, the title read 'new.' However, when I received the item, it was a used one. For my purposes, this was okay because the price was low and I wasn't going to use it for tactical impact protection. ESS makes outstanding products, but I would always purchase 'new' if this is going to be used for any kind of impact protection. I later found out that there are many knock-off ESS goggles on the market, so it is better to buy new so that you can be sure the box and product is authentic and will actually protect your eyes. I am giving the product I received 3 stars because it was used and the foam around the inside was deformed due to wear. If it was new, I would have given it a 5. It is a very comfortable goggle with good field of vision."
5,Really Helpful,"I got this from christmas and i totally loved it!!!I reccomend this if you're going to buy an PALM-OS handheld,beacuse of it's structure,ease of use and the new PALM OS v.5.0If you want a palm and a camera,buy the NX70V (but i reccomend to buy an aditional megapixel or more camera beacuse the nx70 has very low res.).I had an peg n 760c but i gave it away."
5,I don't even like reading!!!,"I'm not even an avid reader, but a friend gave the this book to read and I was captivated! Whether it was before I went to bed, riding my stationary bike, or I just had a little free time to spare I couldn't put it down. Thanks Margaret for putting into words what so many ""twentysomethings"" would like to express but at times can't."
2,Decent advice but couldn't finish book - had to skip around.,"This could have been due to my own stupidity and not fully reading the books description. I am a ""twentysomething"" and I have been reading many books about others in their 20s, quarter-life crisis and such. What turned me off about this book, and what may make others really enjoy this book, is the constant religious and god mentions. I am not a christian so I skipped these parts I was able to get over halfway through the book but then had to put it down and move on to the next. I believe only once or twice before I have been unable to finish a book in the past.This does not mean that this book would not be a wonderful choice for others but for me I could not look past the Religious mentions that did not apply to me."
4,Encouraging Book for a confused 20something Christian,"This book made me realize that I'm not the only one experiencing such a drastic change (and lots of disappointment) after college. The first chapter of the book was alright, but after reading the 2nd chapter, that's when the author tackle the typical problems 20something faces. If anyone is having a tough time adjusting to being an responsible adult, figuring out he/she is suppose to do for the rest of his/her life, confused about which direction to take for career (or whatever goals one might have), this is a good book to read to get you start on the right track. The author definitely reminds the reader that God is in control no matter what, and that our twenty-something years can be a great time in our lives."
5,Loved it,"This is a must read for the confused college grad, floundering young single or even twentysomthing working man or woman. This book radically changed my outlook in this awkward life stage known as the ""twentys,"" and it will do the same for you."
4,Best Columbo Collection around,"Given the ghastly audio quality of the 2003 Taragon/BMG Columbo set, this compilation seems even better than it did when first issued! Nice collection spanning Russ's 1928-1934 recording career. Note, one track (the Gus Arnheim Orchestra's ""Glad Rag Doll"") does not have a Columbo vocal although he is present as a violinist. Great vintage tunes and Columbo's rich delivery make this a must for lovers of romantic 1930's balladry."
3,For the wiseguy...,"Clearly, the listing now shows a picture of the Dolphins Ricky. But, previously there was no picture shown, and there was (and still is) a fictional ""teal jersey"" version available in another listing. That would lead one to believe that this was the Saints version. In fact, several people received the Saints version. Unfortunately, customer service was clueless about the listing.My rating is for the listing/customer service, and has nothing to do with the product itself. The pose is amazing, and McFarlane sportspicks are excellent buys."
4,A hot alternative to the ugly coldness of capitalism,"Robinson's detailed account of the physical brutality of life in Antarctica coupled with a brazen legitimate theory of balancing nature and ""progress"" makes for powerful infusia. In addition,the use of feng shui theory,ecoteurishness and good old-fashioned human relationships give the book a complicated web of layering that was literally impressive."
1,Old territory,"This story covers the same subject matter as the three Mars books Robinson has written. Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well this time. His characters are thin, the plot is very slow to develop, and too much time is spent with characters giving speeches about political correctness and environmental issues. One character literally ""phones in"" his part just to give Robinson the excuse to do much of his preaching. Robinson seems obsessed with the idea of co-ops as the ideal living arrangement and they appear here yet again. The resolution of the plot is not convincing. All in all, a pretty dismal book unless you read it for its political message."
2,"It's so cold, the plot died of hypothermia","As other reviewers have noted, this book's main strength lies in its evocative descriptions of the Antarctic landscape and the day-to-day struggles of the people who live and work there. Indeed, it is a tribute to Kim Stanley Robinson's talent as a travelogue writer that I was almost halfway through the book before I noticed that nothing was actually happening, plotwise. The dramatic conflict hinted at in the opening chapter doesn't really get rolling until page 350 or so, and it is over far too quickly, leaving the novel to wind down into a truly tedious finale in which the protagonists lay plans to turn Antarctica into a Mondragon-style work cooperative. Hopefully someone with a real knack for storytelling will steal Robinson's descriptions and put them to better use, but until then, I'd advise readers to choose a warmer destination."
3,Boring End!,"First, Robinson starts off with a set of assumptions about the future that I don't necessarily agree with. He believes that global warming will dramatically change the environment in the near future - I have my doubts. Secondly, he is convinced that globalization of the economy will impoverish us all - I believe that it will do the opposite.As the story got going, I was able to put these factors aside and really enjoy the middle of the book. Then, with a couple of chapters to go, he stops the story to engage in a nonsensical debate on social-economic theory - BORING!!! I couldn't care less whether Antarctica is managed by a government, a corporation, or one of Mr. Robinson's beloved co-ops. So, I skipped about a chapter and a half and proceeded to the anti-climactic ending.I give it three stars for the enjoyable and educational tour of Antarctica - and not five because of the boring political nonsense."
3,"A bit tedious, but better than the Mars books","I find Kim Stanley Robinson a bit of a hard slog to read. It is like he is showing off about all the clever bits of information he knows about Antarctica or Mars. I am a Geologist, and I have been to Antarctica, so I know can understand all the technical jargon, but I think many would get snowed under in all the fine detail which isn't necessary for the plot and I just feel like he is going 'see how smart I am'.I also found the characters to be pretty much the same as in the Mars trilogy. The asian/eskimo alternative lifestyle guru, the crazy russian guy, the hurt, driven woman, etc.I liked the gist of the story, but a bit too tedious."
1,Unbearable,"Hard as I tried, I could not finish reading this book. It must be the first time in the last 20 years that that happens to me. One of the things I learnt at school: don't use literature to promote propaganda."
4,Good book!,This is the kind of book that makes you want to go there...For me that says all about this book.Another good book from one of my favourite author!
3,Antarctica,"Kim Stanley Robinson is well-known for his Mars saga set in the future on another planet, in Antarctica he brings his formidable talents closer to home to create a hair-raising possibility about our own last continent, the South Pole. Intertwined with rich historical information about the adventurers of yore, their feats and their fears, their beau gestes and their pettiness, Robinson has given us a relentlessly unfolding drama of corporate profit-taking at the expense of employees in the most hazardous of job sites; of ecology protectors contemplating insane protests; of ludicrous yet intensely frank real-time televised travelogues. In the beginning, it all seems so clean and mild. The only enemy the weather, then bad, strange things begin to happen. And as the cracks deepen this isolated community that depends upon the sanity of the whole to keep it from killing itself off, finds itself in dire straits from those coming in for fun, profit or politics. Interesting and didactic."
2,A bit wordy,"I admit I was disappointed in this one - it seemed wordy and didn't really reveal all that much about the place Antarctica to me. On the other hand, Mr. Robinson is one of the few authors out there tackling adventure tales like this who tries to get his facts and science right, and I always appreciate that."
3,Antarctica up for grabs!,"Set in the near future, all who come to this last great wilderness have their own agenda for its development once the international treaty expires. This is one hair-raising richly historical adventure about the feats of explorers, their beau gestes & their pettiness. So nowadays we are different? Not at all! We've just got blander titles such as ecology protectors & corporate profit takers. this is a bit of a slog yet well worth it. Lots to think about. ........."
2,Mawkish,"The best that can be said about this book is that it offers wonderful thumbnail sketches of the great early expeditions to the Pole....Shackleton, Scott, Amundsen. As for the rest, well, that is best left unsaid. Suffice it to say that Kim Stanley Robinson could use an editor with a honed scalpel."
2,Frozen Corn,"Robinson's story was over the top; didactic, preachy and straining the bounds of credulity (blimps on Anarctica?). What it offers are marvelous thumbnail sketches of the great expeditions--Scott, Amundsen and Shackleton. In fact, based on Robinson, I'm about to read about Shackleton. As for the rest, thoroughly skippable."
5,Terrific read,"While this admittedly shares many themes with other KSR books--Gold Coast, the Mars Trilogy--this is a real page-turner. I've noticed several reviews saying the book was boring or too factual, but I couldn't disagree more. Sure, there are some weak spots, but the narrative is engrossing and I could hardly put the book down. That counts for my girlfriend at the time, who read it first, and loved it. The descriptions of the adventure-trek characters was right on, according to her experiences climbing, etc. I highly recommend the book, especially if you're in sympathy with the environmentalist and anticapitalist themes of most of KSR's work."
2,Disappointing,"Unless you are an avid Antarctica buff I don't recommend this one. The main story could have been interesting, but is interrupted with in-depth historical (and other) asides. The main story suffers from lack of character development, lack of intrigue and a general lack of interesting detail. I almost gave up many times. The author's Mars Trilogy is by far better."
2,Antarctia or Pre-Red Mars?,"After reading the geological Mars trilogy (Red, Green, and Blue), I wasn't sure if Antarctica was going to be another geological story. Unfortunately, this turns out to be another story whose focus is on the geology and the environment, instead of a true sci-fi near future story. Though I truly felt as though I were in Antarctica, I did not want to feel this way for 600+ pages. The characters seemed to be secondary compared to the landscape -- and the extended history review of former Antarctic explorers just did not grab me. I wanted this story to wow me, but it just reminded me of Red Mars (the mysterious Asian woman who is leading a group of ferrel explorers who want to get closer to the native livestyle). Don't get me wrong, I'll continue to read Robinson's novels, but maybe geological sci-fi just is not my cup of tea..."
2,Political diatribe,"The book is a thinly-disguised political/ecological polemic, set slightly in the future so we can see the effects of global warming, pollution, etc. Like historical fiction, this book introduces characters in an effort to engage the reader in following its deeper purpose, but these characters are never really developed and serve just as a device. Descriptions of the land itself and life upon it are magnificent, but the nonstop preaching and the culminating chapter (the author's own ""to-do"" list with respect to Antarctica) made it much harder to get through pleasantly - and I AGREE with his political and environmental priorities! The writing at least is excellent, as one might expect."
2,"Pointless remix of other KSR works, without a plot","What would you would get if you took all the interesting and exciting things out of the Mars Trilogy? You'd get Antarctica, a book with no plot about people who go on hikes and romanticize feral living. Or you'd get the ""Science In the The Capital"" trilogy, which is basically the same thing.Kim Stanley Robinson is so frustrating. His Mars Trilogy was so good, so epic, so exactly what I want from hard near-future sci-fi. It was too good, because I keep reading his other works expecting similar genius, and they are all exactly alike, and all terrible in the same ways.After 300 pages I gave up on Antarctica. I am very close to giving up on KSR."
2,a disappointing effort by the author,"This is 2 books, and the first book is ok and the second is unreadable. The first is a story of assorted characters in Antartica in the near future, with lots of geology, weather and exploration history which you should want to read or you should avoid the book altogther. However, it more of a descriptive overview of the area disguised as an novel, and the plot is thin, illogical and filled with subplots that are allowed to wither away without any real development. Then the last third of the book kicks in, and that is the second book. In the guise of various characters speaking, it is a mish-mash of uninteresting political views about assorted environmental topics. Much of it is lioterally in the form of multi-page speeches by the characters, and so isnt even arguably hidden away in an interesting plot line. At that point my close reading accelerated into skim-overdrive and the book became, overall, a failed effort not worth reading."
4,summary to a woman's guide.....,"This book works very well as a tool, i.e. a workbook with exercies that need to be preformed and reflected upon. I would have preferred more case stories; but overall this is a personal book that deals with intimate subjects. The authors do cover a wide range of topics, and attempt to give equal treatment to relationships beyond hetrosexual couples, which should be useful to some readers. I would have found it benefifcal to know in advance that this was designed as a workbook, so that proper time could have ben devoted to the book. Perhaps the title might be changed from a ""guide"" to a handbook or workbook. I would recommend this book, and ample time to the reader, for women who can benefit from assisatnce and advice in overcoming sexual fea and pan."
5,In-depth reference for Print Output,"This book had the most in-depth reference for output, which is the information I was looking for. Other books that are in the market are gear toward chapter by chapter 'training', and does not cover this information extensively like the Bible does. The Bible explains print output for your printer as well as for commercial printing, basic and advance output set up with explanation of what each set up do and what to do to get the results you want. This is a great reference for design/print professionals who are new to the field as well as experts."
5,Good book,This book has everything you need to know about InDesign. I'm not a beginner at InDesign so I am pleased that this book doesn't treat the reader like one.
1,Indesign Bible too meny pages of text,"After reading through the first 500 or so pages I could not bear to read another page. Too much like a reference book with no hands on teaching. I thought the cd that came with it would be like the rest of the adobe books I read with lessons that have text and photos which could be applied to training course chapters. Instead I got what indesign could do if you had text and photo's on it.For someone that likes to read through 1000 and some odd pages to get head knowledge and no hands on experience this is your type of book, but not mine."
4,Nice product but a few miss fires,So far two of the new blinkers are not working. Hopefully there won't be any additional ones that don't blink.
4,best ninja turtle game ever!,"pros:play with favorite (...) kicking ninjaseasy levelslots of good graphicsgood sound3-D actiontakes as low as 4hours to finishcons: hard boss characters,can't play as shreeder and hun in story mode,alot of talking"
4,It Was a Good Game,It Was a very fun game its story mode is based on the episodes and its 2 players in VS mode and story mode/.In Vs Mode there are a couple of characters to play with I'm Not going to tell you all of them but my favorite character in Vs Mode Is Casey Jones aka loonatic with a hockey stick!
2,TMNT is it really worth $39.99 plus tax?,"I wasn't really interested in this game at first... but after thinking about how good the one for super nintendo was, I got it for play station 2.The game itself has good graphics and a good story line... it is way too repetitive... and it gets old fast. You are limited to the four characters (Leonardo, Donatelo, Michael Angelo, and Raphael.) I think its better if you can choose from a variety of characters. Anyway, in my opinion, you are better off renting this game, since you cant return them at your local wal-mart :)"
2,"Fun, but boring and hard.","Well, this game is ok, but Konami really made this game pretty bad. Here are a list of bad things about this game:WAY TOO MUCH VIOLENCE,WAY TOO MUCH TALKING, (""Slice n' dice"" x 1000 = annoiance)LEVELS ARE SHORT BUT TAKE 20-50 MINUTES TO COMPLETE,""INVISIBLE WALL"" PREVENTS RETREATING,TOO SHORT,REALLY HARD BOSSES AND LEVELS TO MAKE YOU SPAZ,PRICE,and GETS BORING AFTER AWHILE.Still fun, but rent it first. Don't buy it for little kids unless they are prone to violence."
5,Rock Shell Dude!!!!!,"This game is utterly auesome!!!except for when you gat to level ""Tengu"",for me its impossible to beat thos mystic dudes!!!And they don't follow each episode in a row!!!! they just skip episodes!!!the eaisiest turtle to be is leonardo and the hardest is probably raphael.let me at least tell you one cheat:unlock master splinter story mode,thats right,not v.s.,story!!!!!!--password:MSRLSi really like the cel-shading too,they make it look more like a cartoon.anyway,you should watch the t.v. shows first then buy the game,i watched the first 13 or 14 episodes then i bought the game.sincerly,kenny"
3,"Extremely fun, but its missing a crucial element...","I love this game so much, its so much fun to play each turtle, AND Master Splinter each with thier own story mode (the story is actually exactly the same for each character, which is kind of one of the problems I have with this game). The biggest problem I have with this game is the saving....each level includes 5-8 ""areas"" and you have to beat each area to the last in order to beat the level, or else the game does not save, and you have to start the level all over again if you lose all your lives. You only get 6 lives per level, so its extremely hard to make them count, especially toward the end. I still have yet to beat the shredder at the end, because he barely lets you make a move before he knocks you down.Overall, as far as fun goes, this game is great. I just wish that they gave us the ability to manuslly save after we beat an ""area"" so the game just might be easier to beat.Turtle Power!!"
2,Could have been much better,"Like previous reviews have stated, it seems very much like a remake of the old TMNT games for nes, but with better graphics. The most amusing part of the game was playing it on Christmas and seeing the turtles wear santa hats. I could only stomach playing the game for about 10 minutes before it got repetetive and boring. The cell shading is a nice touch but does little to enhance the overall playability of the game. If you're a huge Turtles fan, you might enjoy the game, but I'd suggest renting it before you buy it."
2,Boring... according to today's standard,"This game is basically the 3D version of the old Nintendo Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game. What you do in the game is to fight, fight and fight. No mission, no other aims. Graphics are not very special either. I agree with the pervious review that this game is not so good."
1,Ugly,"The graphics are ugly and resemble a cartoon. The worst part though is the stupid phrases that come out of the turtles' mouth(talk about annoying). A game that little kids would enjoy, not adults."
4,its pretty cool,"its okay .well you get to fight a lot of people.And it is just like the movie,like you fight kasey jones with ralf.but some times it can get boring.if you like the movie,and action youl like this game."
2,I wanted this game to be fun...,"...and it was, for a few minutes. It really was satisfying to rack up a 30-hit combo while destroying five or six foot soldiers all at once, just like the old-school TMNT arcade games. And the cel-shaded graphics look awesome.Unfortunately, killing an endless stream of soldiers and robots (who rarely vary) gets old really fast, and the stages are pretty boring despite the colorful graphics. One stage takes place on a subway platform, and I thought trains would be roaring by every now and then, but they don't.As others have mentioned, the sound bites really are annoying, especially Mike's (Eat feet! Eat feet! Eat feet! Eat feet! ad nauseum).The challenge is quite uneven - the stages are incredibly easy, but you'll waste all your lives when you get to the final boss. And you won't want to start over when the stage took you 30 minutes to get through."
2,"Maybe a rent, never a buy!!!!!!!!","What are all the people giving this game good reviews for? This game is incredibly BORING!!!! It gets so old after awhile that i could only play a few levels and i just had to turn it off in disgust. I wasted my money on it, BIG MISTAKE! If you really want to see for yourselves, rent it, DO NOT BUY IT!!!!"
3,Alright but too short,"This game has attractive graphics and a great idea but is poorly executed and not nearly long enough. After awhile I began to feel like I was playing a button masher and you eventually run out of new and different moves. Also the characters say the same things over and over again and it gets really repetitive. Some good and some bad, rent it."
4,"Nice trim,but......","As others have said,there is no diagram on the trim for hot & cold.Its not quite as deep as my original,but I made it work.A bit expensive for what your getting.All in all,not bad."
4,Reggie & THe full Effect Rock!,I first time I herd Reggie & the full effect was on the fuse rock channel the song was called get well soon and it blew my mind. so I decided to check them out and can only say that they rock!
2,These plates are not white,I'm glad I did not purchase these plates. I saw them at a local brick & mortar store and was disappointed by their dingy grayish color. It's a shame because it's a beautiful pattern.
5,ANIMAL KIDS!,"I would say that this book would be a good way of showing young children about animals,science sports, families,song and other things. I would reccommend this book for me and many others as well!"
3,Megalomania meets method,"The best part about this book is that it is extremely detailed. Look at your body in the mirror, and see yourself through Negrita Jayde's eyes. Even the smallest deviation from perfection, she will tell you how to handle. Now if you are a fitness competitor, it is fabulous. But for most standard body sculptors who just want to look fabulous in a bikini, it might be a little too much pressure.The annoying part is - boy! is she full of herself. Every third paragraph or so is full of some story of how she has men driving motorcycles into cars and how she did more squats than anybody else, or how she defeated her swimming coach by swimming faster laps than him, or ...well you get the picture. If your tolerance for people who think too much of themselves is high, you might be a little less irritated."
5,Stories that let you know your not alone,"This book is a collection of one or two page stories about people who create things, the Makers, as it were. And the stories about the people, and what they make, are fascinating and inspirational. Garage handiwork is back (though it really never left), and this book shows how is chic to be geek."
5,Raptorgnosis is a great prog/art rock CD with a pop flavor!,"From Music Morsels -When you work with top prog rock producers Trent Gardner and Robert Berry there are certain expectations. Jack Foster III not only lives up to them on his second CD, he gives you something more. There is a certain prog element to the music, but Jack also infuses subtle brush strokes of jazz, folk and world stylings to paint a vibrant mosaic. Vocally he falls nicely in a mid-ground between Christopher Cross and Greg Lake, providing the perfect foil for his thought provoking lyrics. From the poignant ballad ""Heaven On Earth"" to the gritty guitar rock of ""Koan"", there is some real ear opening music here. [...]"
1,if you want to read sci-fi buy something else,"I've learned a few interesting things about multiple personality disorder from this book. But the book was rather light on the sci-fi side (technology, social changes, attitude changes, etc). Not a really bad book but not a sci-fi either."
1,Basically secular music,"To listen to this album without knowing anything about it, you would probably not realize it was supposed to be Christian music. The beat and the guitar of the songs are so much more prominent than the lyrics that it is difficult to understand what most of the singers are saying, and when you do, the lyrics are so vague that it's still not easy to tell that the music is Christian.You might as well just listen to secular music if you are going to buy this CD."
2,Not all Mogul,"This dish is not all that great, only good for quick fixes and is more of a ""convenience food"". The taste is average, prevelant is usage of artifical flavors and coloring. Additionally, the price here is almost 3 times more than comparative retail price at ethnic stores."
5,test leads from Amazon,These test leads are heavy duty as advertised and I would recommend them especially for the price. You couldn't get a better deal.
2,Average at best,"These leads are cheap but they are also low quality. The tips are pretty big and thick, not good for working with small electronics; definitely worthless when working with surface mount. More ideal for large electrical applications. They ended up breaking about a year after I bought them. It is worth it to spend a little more money and buy pomona or fluke leads."
3,An effective blend of tragedy and humor.,"This is a well written story of the roller coaster ride of a couple who must face the fact of infertility. At times sad, at times humorous, the author quite adroitly captures the flavor and tone of stressful in-laws, infidelity, and an unsatisfying career. The descriptions are detailed, but not overly burdensome. This is as easy, interesting read, chronicling the chapter in the life of a woman who just can't seem to get it together. Readily identifiable, the story pulls you along with ease. Recommended."
3,tie broke- but good for the money,"Purchased for my 5 year old for a wedding- pants have elastic waist in the back and fit well, two pleats in the front. jacket is lined and has a pocket for a hankie and two functional hip pockts. - my son is short for his age and slim so I got size 4T- it fits perfectly no alteration required- the tie clip is a piece of junk broke right away- no worries though, he needed a green tie and hankie to match the wedding party (which i ordered off amazon from ""today's gentleman"" in tree green.)Also the shirt is very cheap- see-through like the polyesther shirts from my catholic school days. But with vest and jacket over top maybe its better to have a thin layer. Looks fine on him. and I'm happy with the price. Less than rental cost of tux. I'll take it to consignment shop when he's out grown it."
1,Not the original hits,With the K-tel label I thought these might be the original hit recordings. But no such luck. Stay away.
3,Hard Going Ancient History,"I have just finished reading Latacz's book. It was tough going, yet for the persistant, some really interesting insights. Much of the text is involved with analysis of the structure, development and geographical relationships of ancient writings. He also spends much time discussing artifacts and clay tablets unearthed in the pertinent Balkan regions and what they indicate about interrelationships of ancient kingdoms. Mostly the focus is on those pertaining to the Hittite, Greek, and surrounding cultures. He establishes what Homer could likely have known, what was handed down by oral tradition, and what the real focus of his poems may have been. No, there are no definitive answers on the historical reality of this particular ""war"" here. But much background evidence is provided that it could well have taken place and subsequently ""romanticised"" by the poet Homer for his contemporary audience."
4,ILL READ MORE FROM THIS AUTHOR,"The mystery may not be that great, but the caracthers are charming and youll have a very nice evening whit this book. Rue Morgue Press has done it again."
5,Captivating short mysteries,"Isaac Asimov, better known for his science fiction series as well as for his non-fiction treatises on innumerable subjects, has crafted captivating short mystery stories. In the vein of ""Minute Mysteries"", the stories of the Black Widowers combines interesting character development as the stories conglomerate. Set in the atmosphere of a social gathering of professional gentlemen of varied fields, the story lines unfold as the members of ""The Black Widowers"" grill the guest of the month in unraveling a mystery they can attempt to solve. Never of earth shattering import, the mysteries are intriguing and challenging. They are also solvable by anyone with a modicum of knowledge on any number of subjects. Truly a treat you can give yourself, a few short minutes at a time."
2,GREAT TITLE...,"GREAT TITLE...for a movie about dead pirates. This is somewhat of a SAW ripoff with various torture/killing scenes but none of the ""intellect"" of the movie. The movie goes on for awhile until it lets you know that it is a movie within a movie. In the 1970's the doctor at this hospital (movie location) made snuff films of his patients. This movie is about that doctor. Then they find a hidden room which contained the actual snuff films. The director watches the film. Soon people start to die, but it is not a who-dun-it. The voices didn't match the lips (foreign). There was some language, simulated sex/oral sex/ girl-girl action. Some very minor nudity, but nothing worth the rental."
3,No Sequel Indeed...,"I've been reading some of the reviews for this movie; and I gotta say that it's not as bad as people make it appear to me. The idea of this flim isn't actually bad. I mean having a movie crew making a movie based off some snuff flims in an asylum; and having the director of the project going all deranged and sadistic... it's kinda orginal if you ask me. Granted the acting is C Rated, with a C+ on the violence, it's really not a bad film to buy for the price Amazon is asking for {$14.99}. I personally think the idea of this movie is decent and could have been done a lot better. I think my favorite part of watching this movie was seeing the director watch the snuff flims and get ""inspired"" for his movie; oh and the ending actually made me go ""Wow... how unexpected, nice"". Overall it's not that terrible and not bad for your horror collection. However get it for a low-price; you'll feel more content I believe. Lucky there is NO SEQUEL, because I think it'd be actually horrible."
5,Your own personal time machine!,"I love the way Colette writes, her descriptions and words just take me back to that period of time, turn of the century Paris. She gives flavor to the book making us feel what the Parisian culture was like at that time. I totaly love Gigi. I've watched the movie first which is why I bought the book in the first place. I like the book because it describes more of the affair and courtesan stuff which the movie sugars up to give it a G rating. I just wish that Colette could've had Gigi go be Gaston's arm ornament at some party like Gigi did in the movie."
5,One of My Favorites,"I first read this book when I was in high school, and have gone back and read it at least 3 times. It follows the Prinz/Prince family through WWI and II. It is really interesting."
3,"cute book, incorrect terminology.","I love and grew up with horses so when I found this book to buy for my 10 month old I was very pleased. My ONLY qualm with it is on page 3 the last sentence of the first paragraph reads, ""Hank had saved her from the wolves when she was just a baby COLT..""it should read, ""..when she was just a baby FILLY."" When talking about horses, Filly is a baby female, Colt is a baby male. Since Calico the horse is referenced to as a ""She"" she would be called a filly, not a colt. It might seem trivial but I can't stand incorrect information! I just simply crossed it out and wrote ""filly"" underneath in the book, lol! Other than that, cute story!"
1,Mind-numbing.,"I felt obligated to finish the trilogy. It was a mistake. This book was so unbelievably boring. You see, Tristan and Isolde get separated. Then Tristan is beset by something and then Isolde whines to the Goddess, oh my love my love. Then they get back together, and then they get separated and then Tristan is beset by something and Isolde whines to the Goddess, oh my love my love. Repeat. It's horrid. I wish I could get a refund. Truly, don't waste your time. Try the Kushiel series by Jacqueline Carey, it's a way better investment in your time (and reading dollar.)"
1,boring pseudo feminist crap,"Do not waste your time. This is a boring book with the ability to take the incredibly interesting story of Tristan and Isolde, Arthur and the round table and the legend of Merlin and make them nauseating. Recap (of this series) Tristan is a wimp, Isolde is naive and whines a lot, most of the women are slutty, Everyone worships the Goddess except the crippled, retarded Christian monks/priests. I could go on but why bother. I wasted enough time reading the book and only finished it because I thought it might get better. Didn't."
4,"So far, so good. But how can a consumer truly rate motor oil?","My 6-cylinder car has over 167,000 miles on it and the motor still purrs like a... well, you know. I recently added Royal Purple 15W-40 for the first time. After driving perhaps 1,500 miles with the Royal Purple, everything seems fine. The motor still purrs. Besides, how the heck can a regular consumer like me rate a motor oil unless something goes horribly wrong? If all goes well, you simply say that it's good stuff. And how does a regular consumer justify paying the price of this stuff? Perhaps in a year or so, when the Royal Purple has 12-15K miles on it, I wll give it another review. For now, I'll just say that...having it in my engine gives me a little more piece of mind. Just a little."
4,Royal Purple oil is majestic,"Yes, the product arrived as promised on time. No shipping snags and despite my own hesitance about buying a five gallon ""pail"" of motor oil, it all occurred just fine. Amazing. If you want royal purple, this is the way to go. low cost and no shipping charges ""added on"": how can you beat it. Its pretty hard to get royal purple at $7.24 a quart.Give these guys a try, you'll be happy. VTY, Mr. R."
4,worth the dollars,"Used this oil in my Ford 7.3 with a slide in camper on the back. 5,000 miles driven. No loss of oil. Vehicle started and ran well. Toss up between Amsoil and Royal Purple. Make your own choice but Royal Purple does not make an oil filter for the 7.3. Extended drain intervals are good but you have to change your oil filter to extend. K&N were recommended by Royal Purple. Amsoil makes a filter so there is no inconvenience if you are traveling. All in all, it seemed to work well in my truck."
5,Perfect for little things,"This craft cabinet is perfect for all the loose nails, screws, bolts, etc. around my house. Now they are all in one place! I was surprised how much each drawer could hold and only wish I had gotten this sooner."
4,Great for Lego's!,"I was looking for a storage unit for my three year old son's Legos. This is the perfect product for them. Great for sorting and organizing. The drawers come out easily so it is nice when he needs the Legos for building. Not too big and just the right size. Very light weight and easy to handle. I would have given it 5 stars, but a few of the drawers' little stopper pieces came broken. (It actually isn't much of a problem that they are broke, but it shouldn't have come broken either way so...)"
1,Terrible product,The face of this product that is red is rippled in certain spots and not smooth. I have two of these and both of them arrived with broken clips that keep the clear drawers from sliding all the way out. Very disappointed.
5,Misc Storage,The cabinet is sturdy and not cheaply made. It works perfect for storing all kinds of materials.
4,A Very Functional Organizer,I looked around for an organizer which combines the right amount of small and large bins - this is the one. The only drawback is that they do not include the dividers for the 12 large bins (I had to purchas seperetely for $12 w/shipping!).
1,Gave up after two broken units,"This might be a decent drawer unit but it seems a bit flimsy and after having received two broken units I gave up on it. It is probably just as much Amazons fault as the drawer units fault that it arrived broken twice, but in any case it isn't very sturdy. If you don't mind the drawers falling out then it might be fine but otherwise I would consider buying something else."
3,does the job,Slightly on the flimsy side but not bad for the price. On a couple of drawers the tabs wich keep the drawer from falling out when you pull them open broke off. Still not a bad product.
4,Product as advertised.,"The product is as advertised. tons of space , especially when you put in the partitions in each bin. I just used cardboard paper to make those partitions, although you can pay and pick up some plastic ones from Akro. Good quality product. I'll be buying more."
2,American name Chinese quality. Thank you america.,This isn't the Acro Mils organizer that we have had in out garages for years and years.I went out of my way to buy an american product with a name that I already had in my garage. I assume that this will last in my garage for about 5 years before I am ready to buy another. Next time I guess I will have to spend 100.00 each or more to get the quality that I expect.If I would of know that this was chinese grade I would of just bought a chinese product. No backing on the case. I would not hang this on the wall with nuts and bolts..I guess this product was designed for light items like beads and fly fishing items. Not for the mechanic nuts and bolts type ( I restore small motorcycles ).I am saddened that American products have had to go so cheap on materials that they have also become throw away products.
1,Missing dividers,"OK storage unit but it arrived without the normal drawer dividers, which effectively halves the number of unique items it can store. But Not worth the hassle to return.Too bad"
2,Expected better for the 37 bucks,"I'd been searching for a better quality organizer than what I'd seen in the local stores when I decided to give this one a try after reading the reviews.I was disappointed when it arrived and one tiny little piece of plastic that keeps the drawer from falling out was broken on the front edge of the cabinet. These pieces are probably no more then 1/8 of an inch long and wide. I was sure with regular use, more would break. After giving the rest of the product an inspection I decided it really was no better for the price than what I'd already seen and sent it back. Amazon gave me a full refund and I'll try something else. The cabinet seemed sturdy enough for the job of holding screws and bolts however, if I had removed the dividers for the drawers from the back I was sure it would have weakened the carcass quite a bit. It might be a value if it cost about 20 bucks but NOT at almost $40."
4,Very Nice!,"This is a very nice cabinet for all your nuts and bolts. Very sturdy. The only problem with it is, that it sags in the middle when you fill it up. I put a piece of thin foam in the middle underneath and it fixes the issue. This product needs a foot in the middle like it does on each end on the bottom to fix this issue."
4,"Great for storage, not for carrying things","I'm very pleased with this storage solution mounted on a wall, as all the other reviews have said. However to set expectations right, I will say that this is not suitable for carrying your parts around. It's not a toolbox that you can bring to places. And if you're moving to a new home, you will want to take out everything stored in it and pack them separately. Just sticking this cabinet in a box with everything still in it will not work well because they will all fall out en route and you will have a good time sorting them out afterwards.Basically the back of the cabinet is not at all sealed. There is plenty of room and gaps between drawers that'll let pieces fall out easily. The drawers are not very secure either, meaning accidentally tipping the cabinet forward will cause all the drawers to fall out, dumping everything in them. The only safe solution is to always keep it perfectly level and stable, i.e. mounted on a wall."
4,Excellent product,"The little drawer components are a great space saver for things like, batteries, erasers, paper clips and other small objects."
3,NO BACK PANEL????,"This seems sturdy enough for plastic BUT it has NO BACK COVER so when the 2 tiny plastic hooks that hold back the little light weight plastic drawers from going all the way though the cabinet break off (and since it has only 2 half the length of the space runners for the drawer to rest on) WHERE DO YOU THINK these drawers are going to end up IF you do not attach it to a wall? How about out the back of it and everything spills... on to the floor, the counter, whatever. I just cut and taped a piece of card board to the back of it. Not pretty but now can move it as needed and not worry about any spillage."
2,For lightwieght items only - poor construction,"Bought three sets of these because they were the right size for my workbench and the red front looked cool. Unfortunately, these bins just don't hold up in a garage when you fill the drawers with steel nuts, bolts and washers. As the collective weight of all the items in the cabinet goes up, the storage bin literally pulls apart. That cool-looking red front is only press fitted onto the gray backing. Not molded onto it, not glued onto it, not even snapped onto it. As the weight of the parts increases, the gray shelving warps in such a manner that the red front literally pulls away from the gray section. Only happens on the units that I store metal parts. In the unit I store lightweight items like wire nuts, zip ties, and very small screws, the bin is OK. If your needs call for something that will hold drawers full of bolts, screws, washers, etc., avoid this parts bin and spend the extra money on steel storage bins. That's what I'll be doing."
4,Used to store Legos,I bought this for my son to keep his Legos a little more organized. The top drawers are small but so are the Lego pieces so it doesn't seem to be a problem. Now if I could only get him to finish sorting the Legos and use all the drawers we'd be a lot more organized!The cabinet is made of plastic and the drawers slide easily. It's good quality and works well for our use.
3,"OK Storage, Could Be Better","I bought this case for my garage to store small parts like washers and screws things like that. I think that its an ok storage case, but a bit too expensive for the quality. It is constructed from cheap plastic and I wonder if it will break down over time as cheap plastic does. Mine already has a small crack in the bottom right corner and has not suffered any abuse in my possession. I think I should have gone to Walmart or Lowe's and looked at some like other people here have mentioned. I do like being able to look throgh the drawers to see what is in them rather than labeling them like for a wood case. I think this case should have sold for about 15% less with the shipping to be a decent value."
3,It holds things,"The plastic cabinet is a bit thin, and the drawers are a half-measure of thickness above Ziploc, but it works. Biggest gripe: the holes for mounting are spaced at 18"". I would prefer they be at 16"" for reasons obvious to US homeowners."
2,Not quite as expected,One of the drawer stops was totally broken and gone. I saw it before I removed the shrink packaging. It should have been caught by quality control.
4,Simple but effective,"With just buying a house and redoing rooms we started to accumulate misc. parts, plus all the screws and nails this has been a life saver in getting my husband's work bench and all our bags and boxes of tools organized and labeled so we know where to find things... The only thing I would do differently is get two of them."
2,Not worth the money,"This item is not made well. One of the stoppers on the drawer was broken when I received it. Even if this item were in perfect condition, it will not do well holding garage type items such as bolts and nuts. It would seem to do well holding plastic buttons and thread (for crafts)."
2,Cheaply made poor design,Mine arrived with two of the small plastic drawer stop tabs broken off - these tabs keep the drawers from being pushed too far into the cabinet when closed. The drawers work...but they do not stop correctly - this allows them to be misaligned and to push too far into the cabinet. I used small screws and epoxy to fix the problem - I could have returned the item for a replacement but the next one would have been just as poorly made.
2,Not what I was looking for,"The drawers are sort of cheesy and theres just this cheap feel to it. Its not a bad product for the price, but I guess I was just looking for something of higher quality, I should have forked out some more cash for something better."
3,Doesn't look new,"The product came looking used. Each drawer has two small plastic pieces that hold the drawer from falling out when you open them. On four of these drawers, one of the plastic pieces is broken. This doesn't really affect overall performance, but it's not how I expect to receive a new product either. In addition to the broken drawers, there are scratches on all sides of the black plastic case. I could send it back, but it would be more trouble than it's worth."
3,Good product by damaged,"The draws are very useful for organizing small items such as screws, electrical, batteries, etc. The one I received was damaged with many scratches on 3 of the 4 sides but it was not worth the hassel to return it."
4,Great item but some drawer stops broken on arrival,"I was looking for something to organize my overflowing costume jewelry collection and this is perfect. the small drawers are large enough to house necklaces with plenty of room to spare for matching earrings and bracelets as long as they are not solid in shape. the larger drawers will definitely hold bracelets of all types, or any type of necklace bracelet earring sets. I will be ordering more of these for sure. The only negative as in the other reviews is that some of the drawer stop tabs were broken off upon arrival, but they are basically a molded tab to begin with so there is a good possibility that the tabs themselves will not last the lifetime of the cabinet. Still a great organizer for my purposes."
2,Are we done yet,"I was disappointed in this and only got it as i ahd the first one. It is oky, but does not live up to the first one."
3,Not as good as first movie,"This movie continues where the first one left off. This time Nick is having a hard time making his ""dream home"". This movie is no match for the first one, though. This one has some funny parts, but the first is still better. If you don't have Are We There Yet-I was suggest getting it. As for the second one, you can decide for yourself."
3,More Slapstick Then Substance,"""Are we Done Yet"" is the sequel to Ice Cubes ""Are We There Yet"" but the two stories really have nothing to do with each other. You do not need to watch the first movie to enjoy the second. This movie is your typical silly children's movie. Its more slapstick then substance but enjoyable nonetheless. Ice Cube and the actor playing the obnoxious handyman ""Chuck"" are both convincing and decent actors in the movie.I give this a 3.5 out of 5 stars."
1,"OMG: All I can say is ""Save your Money""!!","Ice Cube should have gotten on his hands and knees and begged ""Smokey"" to do a guest appearance in this movie......Maybe it would have made it bearable to watch (just a little) if Chris Tucker had a small part......People, please save your money and your time. I repeat, ""People, please save your money""!! If you just got to see, try to buy at the dollar store and ask for half off.....I like the brother and all but Ice Cube need his butt whipped......But Nia Long did have on some cute boots. (smile)"
2,"Plot okay, Content Not","I liked the movie plot, but I did not like the sexual connotation within the film. I have this DVD and will be trashing it when my daughter's back is turned so that she won't watch this movie again. The first movie was so much more family oriented than this one. I can't believe some of the lines in this film classify this movie as a ""family film."" It's almost like the writers of this film ran out of creativity to put this film together. Some of the lines were just plain distasteful."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST.........,"In this sequel to Are We There Yet, Ice Cube is back in his starring role of Nick Persons, who is now a newlywed with a ready-made family in the form of wife Suzanne (Nia Long) and her two children from a previous relationship. Cramped into what was formerly his bachelor pad, the couple soon learn that they are expecting....twins. And at Suzanne's urging to find a bigger place to live, the two begin househunting. It doesn't take long for the Persons family to locate the house of their dreams. But when things start falling apart around them, Nick begins to see the house as a bit of a nightmare. Will it take an eccentric real estate agent/contractor/inspector/baby whisperer to make Nick see past all of the repairs for the real home that their new residence could really become?Fun for the whole family, this is a lighthearted comedy that just about everyone will enjoy. Not a masterpiece, but is that really required for a little fun?DYB"
2,another sequel?,"Is this movie done yet? lets hope so. All the good scenes (not to say they are funny to begin with) was already shown in it's trailer teaser so why do you need to see the movie. Plus, the teenage daughter in this movie as well as JoJo in the RV movie truly represents what it's like to be a spoiled american kid in the United States."
2,Waste of good talent.,"Even though Ice Cube is a funny, appealing character no matter what--this movie is just too dumb. A waste of goodtalent on everyone's part. Rent it first if you have to see it. I didn't and now am selling it on Amazon for alot cheaper than I bought it for. Are We Done Yet was better."
5,Great!,Delivered in a very timely manner and in tip top shape. Would definitely shop with this seller again.
1,BAD BUSINESS,"WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO VIEW THE VIDEO THE PICTURE REPEATEDLY GOT STUCK OFF AND ON ALL THROUGH THE MOVIE. WILL DEFINITELY BE RETURNING. THIS WAS ""SUPPOSED"" TO BE A NEW VIDEO I HAD PURCHASED BUT INSTEAD IT SEEMS AMAZON HAS SENT ME A USED AND DAMAGED COPY. WILL NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON ANYMORE IT IS NOT WORTH THE RISK."
5,"Extreme, compelling, spellbinding, graphic","This book is only for those that feel the need to experience the ultimate in fictional writing. Stay far away if you have an ounce of moral outrage because this book will likely offend all but those with the thickest of skin. From the first page on, I couldn't put it down. I've been on a 2 year search for more writing from this author."
5,Worth the price of admission,"I admit it - the first time I heard KOL was Molly Chambers on the VW Jetta commercial, and as anti-music-for-advertising as I am, there was no way of denying that this was real rock n' roll. So I bought the song, listened to it about a hundred times and realized that my initial assessment was correct.Then I bought the Holy Roller CD and was even further convinced, if that were possible. Another reviewer stated that these guys sound like they invented rock n' roll, and that's so true - and it needs to be invented every once in while. When contemporary music gets to the point where image and hype supplant talent and energy, fortunately there's always someone or some band to shake things up and make it new again.The Stones did it (may they rest in peace), Alice Cooper did it, the Ramones did it, Nirvana did it, and KOL does it.This is a great album."
4,Strong debut EP,"This EP is alright by me, sort of like The Allman Brothers Band or Lynard Skynard. Its a good listen especially the 2nd and 5th songs. Kings of Leon are a part of the ""second-generation new (old) rock revolution,"" The first being The White Stripes, The Strokes, The Hives and to a lesser extent The Vines. The second wave includes the Kings of Leon, the Raveonettes, and the Black Keys. These bands were already together and the Stroke's sucess basically got them their record deals. Soon you'll see the dreaded 3rd generation of bands who started up when they heard the Strokes (shudder,) but for now enjoy this southern-rock gem."
3,Southern Fried Leon,"Just think The Strokes if they were raised in Mississippi or if John Cougar Mellencamp had been raised on Television. This is basically rock with a southern spin on it, eg, garage rock meets The Black Crowes or The Georgia Satellites. It's an interesting mix. Twangy layered guitars, a bit of organs, and laidback melodies/vocals."
4,Unweaving the Rainbow,"This is yet another lucid, readable book from Richard Dawkins. It is full of fascinating facts and clear arguments. I'm unsure if you need a whole book to argue the case for the wonder of science (often the science speaks for itself!), but leaving this far reaching premise for a book to one side and it is an amazing read overall. This is a great read if you're a fan of Dawkins or wish to read a varied book about some of the great and fascinating discoveries of science."
2,Disappointment,"I hate to say it, but after reading The Selfish Gene, this book was a disappointment.Dawkins can be heavy handed at times, and Unweaving the Rainbow really felt more like a personal rant than a well-researched piece of writing. Even for me, someone who agrees with Dawkins at every level, it was too much to stomach at times.To Dawkins credit, there are some interesting chapters in Unweaving the Rainbow about light, sound, and, of course, genes and evolution. However, for me it was not worth wading through the constant criticism of those who condemn science to get to 'the good stuff'.I strongly recommend The Selfish Gene to anyone who has not read it, but I can't recommend Unweaving the Rainbow."
4,You can't say it often enough!,"So what if we've heard it before. Dawkins is the best person around to drum home the message, and anyone who disagrees wih that message should, in my perfect world, be thrown to the lions with the christians! (And Gould)!"
1,Pathetic Redundancy,"Ever since The Selfish Gene, Dawkins has continued to repeat himself over and over again. While The Blind Watchmaker contained some refreshing ""newness,"" his latest books (River out of Eden, Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the Rainbow) have been so completely boring they make you want to vomit. Dawkins is a good writer, but he can't seem to come do much more than mix up old ideas. He's turned Darwinism into a religion and it's getting lame.Skip this book. Skip all his books. Let him wallow in his world that he's made for himself. These books have nothing to do with science, but with a man who has set out to prove Darwinism. It's pseudoscientific, it's boring, and it's sad.Save the money and buy Steven Jay Gould's books."
1,Rainbow Shredder,"Terrible disappointment. Mr. Dawkins begins the book with chip on his shoulder regarding the dumbing down of science to make it more accessible to the lay person. He then proceeds to dish out watered down, unorganized bits of fact and fancy riddled with ""witty"" observations and speculations that more often than not are left hanging in mid air.It was akin to being cornered by your crazy uncle at a holiday gathering and being forced to bear testimony to the latest developments of his ""theories"".I rarely if ever put down a book with such distaste, but after being able to digest less and less of each chapter, I was forced to discard it at Chapter 6. Maybe there's a silver lining to the cloud behind this rainbow, but I doubt it's worth the effort."
3,Good read which rapidly gets side-tracked.,"This books begins well, arguing about the sense of wonder and awe a life in science brings. When I read the blurb, I wondered if it was possible to write a whole non-fiction book on such a subject. Dawkins exhausts himself by the first 3 or so chapters and then spends the rest of his time ranting and raving about his own personal hang-ups, which have nothing to do with the title. The individual chapters make good reads, but stand better as separate essays rather than several stages in an argument. I would recommend this book only to those who are very interested in the psyche of the ulta-Darwinist that is Dawkins."
4,"brilliant writing, but too much anger","Dawkins lives by the beauty and wonder of science and wants his readers to share his enthusiasm. He was more convincing when he wrote brilliantly about science than when he wrote bitterly about people. He often seemed to be trying to group huge and disparate people (from xfile fans to all of Christianity) in one broad brushstroke, and that did bother me. Still, a clear and lucid thinker, and a pleasure to read."
5,Dawkins has done it again,"This is a fascinating look at humanity, science and understanding our world - and the universe. It is a serious book, but not a dull read at all. Life is good - enjoy it while you can."
3,"A commentary not on this book, but on its ""reviewers""....","This needn't be printed here, as it is only a reflection of my thoughts on the reviewers and not a commentary on the book itself. But then, that, I think, is the very point. I find it most interesting as I browse through the reviews and examine the ""helpful"" tallies, that this review session seems to have served more as a forum for a discussion of God vs. science than a real dialog on the merits of the book. (In fact, I find it telling that I was tempted to vote on the reviews based not on their helpfulness, but on how I felt about the viewpoint which they expressed.) I wonder then, if a book that has managed to provoke this much thought isn't somehow valuable regardless of whether or not one agrees with it? For isn't literature nothing if not an ongoing discussion? Just food for thought...."
4,Brilliant,"I positively love Dawkins literary style. The more of his books you read, the more you can feel how passionate he is about science and the natural world. The ""official"" book reviews call ""Unweaving The Rainbow"" a ""love letter to science."" I suppose you could call it that. I actually found it extremely informative on many scientific subjects, without being overly scientific or complicated. This would be an excellent read for someone who wants to learn something about natural sciences without getting drowned in all the professional, scientific jargon. The only reason I took a star away from this book is because I do feel that he gets a bit carried away with the poetry inserts. I'm not much of a poetry buff anyway, and the regularly inserted poems or poetic briefs only seem to get in the way of the interesting stuff in the book. Otherwise I loved this book immensely and would highly recommend it to anyone, whether scientifically inclined or not!!"
5,A Fantastic Read,"It is so refreshing to read a science book by a decent writer. A hugely important aspect of science has to be communication - letting others know what you're on about! Dawkins is a gifted writer who manages to convey fairly complicated concepts to the lay reader. Life is about learning, and a writer such as Dawkins makes it a joy."
1,Poor quality,Poor quality copies of obsolete gov't manuals. Not at all useful or relevant. Went right to the recycle bin-a disappointment.
2,Book is GREAT! Kindle version not so much....,"I love the book as I have enjoyed the entire A.D. Chronicle series on my Kindle. In fact, I was the one who let the Thoenes know it was not available. But I must say the book on Kindle is so terribly chopped up in it's page placement that it is difficult to read. Please have another go at it."
5,Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I read the first book in this series because a local christian store was selling them for $5 with a new membership. I loved it so much that I could not wait to read the second. I am 2 chapters in and have already ordered the 3rd!!!!!
3,Ok book,Starts slow and slot of speechifying but a good read wonderful characters lovely way to bring them home to love
2,Boring,I couldn't finish this book. I didn't like the main characters and got bored very quickly with the story. It took too long to get on with the story.
4,Model Railroad building made easy.,"I am very pleased with the book. It has added to the other books in the series that I have bought. Now, to find the time to use it!!"
4,Great vintage era music,"I do a lot of dancing, but I love to listen too. These are original recordings with great hits and a wide variety of themes and tempos. I listen to them at work all the time! It's a nice long CD with a running time of 74 minutes."
1,Ain't no Rides!,"Very disappointing. What little actual content there is is drawn out, has extremely annoying ad breaks, virtually no tech content, many repeated video clips and has obviously been put together for a 'general' audience. If you're a true gear head, you'll be bored. Give me an episode of Rides any day!"
1,I may have gotten a lemon,"I am sorry to report this this pedometer has not proven to be accurate.I hope I will be sent a replacement.I followed all the instructions to no avail.Example, on what I know to be a one mile walk. It gave one reading on the first leg and a different reading on the return on the same path.I would be happy to return this and get another in exchange. Perhaps I got a defective pedometer. I know that happens.I could then write a more positive review."
3,good product--lousy customer support,"I have been doing bookkeeping for nearly 20 years, but I had a few questions about how this software works when I installed it. I was entitled to a full 30 days of free introductory customer support, but they only answered one question, then did not respond to any other questions until the 30 days were up. Then they wanted me to PAY for answers to my questions.Tax tables to support payroll are double the amount that I paid for them with my old software.MYOB Account Edge is a great product, but unless you have more experience that I have, or are willing to pay, I'd look elsewhere."
3,"Functional, but don't put it through the wash!","I bought two of these slings when I bought the 40 oz bottles. The slings fit in the bottles, and work as expected.However, I just put one of these through the wash, and all the seams came apart and was fraying. It said it was able to go in the washer, but I guess not. :("
4,Fits like a Glove,"Love the Kleen Kanteen vs my Swiss made container, in that it allows you to use regular ice cubes to cool the liquid. The only thing missing was the strap. Now with the holder, you can easily carry your liquids with you wherever you need to--tennis court etc. I don't know what more you would want or need in a carrier."
4,shoulder sling for water bottle,what can you say about a water bottle sling ? It works as advertised...
5,a better way to carry your water,"With all the new worries about re-usable plastics and the environmental issues of disposable water bottles, we have opted to go with stainless steel. We have loved them so far and look forward to years of use."
2,"Good for walking, terrible for more intense activities...","I bought these to hold a generic metal water bottle while jogging/running. It holds the bottle quite firmly, but bounces around too much to wear while active. Good for walkers, but bad for runners."
5,Excellent bottle,This bottle is light weight and well made. The water seems to taste better out of staneless steel too than plastic bottles. I would recommend this brand.
5,Stainless Steel Saved my Life,"3 months ago, I was on the verge of being tested for MS. I woke each day in intense pain in my arms, legs, neck and back. Getting my 8 year old son ready for school had become a full time job. I barely slept and at 48 thought my life was over. By 10am I was shot. Then I got an email about the dangers of re-using plastic water bottles. The email suggested using glass or stainless steel. As I had done all my life, I was drinking about 80 oz of water a day, and was using a large brown plastic Arizona Iced Tea bottle as my water bottle. I figured it was worth a try. I threw out my plastic water bottle and began using a Klean Kanteen. In less than 4 days I had my life back. I love the Klean Kanteen! Its durable, looks great, and SAFE! Its worth every penny. I bought my son the 18 oz size to bring to school and camp."
3,Great Container... spout needs work,"The bottle is top quality. The spout needs work. Too much effort to get water out of bottle. It also makes noise. There has got to me a better sipping spout design. On the plus side, it is secure and spillage is minimal."
1,The description title is misleading,"Read the title carefully. It is just a sling, note the beautiful stainless steel bottle as the picture and title might suggest . I made a mistake, read it too fast, and the last two words ""shoulder sling"" just did not catch my attention. Silly me."
3,Handle with care,"Bought this for my wife and it's a beautiful looking watch. However, it does scratch easily. I recommend removing the links to fit your wrist snug to keep it from dangling and reduce the chances of scratching it."
5,movado,"I bought this watch as a gift for my self and I love it. I wear it every day and i am considering the blue face also. looks great never had a problem, the band does become scratched with wear."
4,Good printer,"The printer took longer to arrive than promised, and left me in the lurch for a job I had planned. I called your customer service and was virtually told off, what did I expect at that time of year. I really felt I should have purchased it locally in view of his attitude, but in the past I have been more than happy with my dealings with Amazon. The only other problem was, I installed the printer, the test page was fine, but the first color job came out black & white. I had to go to the Brother web site to down load a later Vista driver (Circa 2007) that did the trick. Surely a printer should have updated drivers (Over a year old drivers)when it is shipped."
5,Brother HL-4040Ccn,"Good value. Printer was easy to install: Remove from the box; install toner cartridges; connect to my network. The installation CD made it easy to connect each of my computers to the printer (I run both Windows XP Pro and Vista Home). Print quality is very good. Printer goes to ""sleep"" mode when not being used and is fairly quick to change to print mode when a page is sent to it. Delivery was quicker than the estimated time. I'm guessing it was sent by truck because the well packed box was too large to come by FedEx or UPS."
1,Finally Replaced this printer,"I have had this printer running in a small medical office for several years. I should have replaced it long ago but just never got around to it. We us it to print informational material, invoices, patient educational material. As one other reviewer said it does leak toner. It was constantly needing to be swept up after using it for the day. And it wastes toner like crazy. Overall just a poorly engineered piece of technology. Replaced with an HP."
2,a critical flaw,"I purchased the printer for office use for medium volume printing of mostly pdf and word files when it was on sale.One critical flaw of this printer is that when printing pdf file with mixed text and photo, it uses color toners to print black text!!! I contacted Brother tech support and asked about this problem. Their response - there is no solution for this and I have to live with it. I didn't get the feeling that Brother is interested in fixing this problem based on my experience with their tech support by phone and email.If you print a lot of documents in pdf format, stay away from it."
5,Another Great Brother Laser Printer,I purchased this item from Staples website. It is a refurbished unit and it has the same 1 year warranty as a new unit. I was very pleased with the setup and the ease of use. I have had 5 or 6 other laser printers from Brother but this is my first color laser jet. Brother creates great products and it is very fast for a color laser jet-about 15 pages a minute. I really like the product and I will update my opinion along the way. The setup with Vista and Mac OS 10.4.11 was flawless. Thanks for reading.
2,Good overall but crinkles envelopes,"Overall the printer is a good value when you can get it on sale. I paid less than $200. However, it is horrible for printing envlopes. No matter the type of envelope I use, it always crinkles them. I don't know if the heat is too high or what but I can only use the envelopes for personal mail, not business related."
3,Cheaper elsewhere,"I usually get all my stuff from Amazon but this time Staples had this item for$229.00. It was on sale till August 8, 2009 but even their retail price is cheaper than this."
2,Just okay printer-- two year review,"This printer does fine with black and white printing and is relatively fast and quiet. I am not at all impressed with the color printing and have had streaky lines on my prints many, many times. I already have a Brother black and white, so I really bought this for the color printing. On the upside, the toner lasts a really long time in both of these Brother laser printers. Also, a new problem has developed where the printer will stop working if you put too much paper in the tray. The amount of paper that causes it to stop is really quite small-- maybe a 100 pages. Not sure why this is happening, but it is very annoying. I'd skip this color Brother and find another printer if I had it all to do over again."
2,Colors Did Not Match...,"I thought I was getting a really good deal and while I agree the print quality is very good, the colors did not match what was on my monitor. I was printing our Christmas program and decided to give the printer a try. I hooked it up and printed the program and came out with a blue Christmas tree (it was supposed to be green, of course). No matter how I tweaked it, it still remained a blue tree. Researched the solution on their website and it said ""color of the printout may not match what is on your monitor."" My old HP Color Laserjet 3550 hit it right on the nose. I ended up taking it back. If color is important to you, you might want to look elsewhere."
3,DON'T buy this if you want to listen to it on your computer,"I enjoy Chris' music quite a bit. I won't pretend to be a music critic but his music is simply excellent.But there's a problem with this CD. When I try to listen to it on my computer, it launches a music video that takes over my screen entirely. You can't listen to the normal songs on the CD. If you try to go back to the work that you were doing before you put the CD in the drive, then the Chris Rice video stops.That's right, you have no choice but stopping whatever work you were doing and watching the Chris Rice video. You can't just listen to the music while you do your work.Maybe this is some kind of reaction to copyright infringement. I think it's a shame. I'd be surprised if it were Chris' idea.But when I listen to it in my car or living room stereo, it's a great CD ! I do wish that Chris would put more new songs on each CD though. Many of these are repeats."
1,If you can only buy one book - DON'T MAKE IT THIS ONE.,"I thought the lay out of this book and its' pamphlet and cdrom, show some care and was well thought out (at least on paper). However, there are so many errors in this release. More than any other technical book or reference that I have ever seen (and my personal library is extensive). The cdrom tests are particularly riddle with errors. The author of this book needs to consider a new editor and/or proofreader. This should never have made it to press. So as to not be totally negative, most errors are blatant enough to catch and they do force you to look up the truth in some other reference.. I certainly would not use this as your only study source. But I do believe it would be helpful as tertiary study guide. (Use it to catch the errors)"
4,Hits the Topics On the EXAM,"I just took the exam and I think that this book prepared me the most. Don't expect to memorize everything and pass. You can't underestimate hands on, but this book will tell you what you need. I had some problems with the practice Exam on the cd repeating the questions over and over but besides that the book really helped. The pull out cheat sheet was very helpful. This was the second of 2 books that I bought to prepare for the Exam, but if I bought this first I wouldn't have needed 2. Don't be fooled by the high reviews on the on the other book this is the one that will help the most with what to know for the exam."
2,Ever hear of reviewing books before you publish them?,"Seems like the publishers were only interested in reviewing grammar and spelling and not ensuring the technical content was accurate. The book touts that fact that Ms. Martinez ""teaches"" Linux, but she obviously doesn't *use* it. The book is full of technical misconceptions (no, Linux does not work just like DOS) and inaccuracies (how about running a command to see how it works?). The book comes has a CD with an electronic test, but that has just as many mistakes as the book. It is easy to understand the material, but if you are not proficient in Linux, you should **always** test it to make sure it's correct. (Which it isn't quite often). Considering how many Linux certification books are out there, your money is best spent somewhere else."
2,A lot of wrong and missing information...,I tried to use this book but lost confidence after finding a large number of errors. The practice questions used options that were never covered in the text and some of them use options that don't even exist for the specific commands. Along with this I found a large number of incorrect filename and syntax errors. It was as if the commands were never tried and the author had no experience with them. I found error after error when attempting to use the commands and information presented in this book. I would pass on this book and try a general linux book instead...
4,Great resource with minor flaws,This book was a great help to me in preparing for the test. It comes with a flash note pullout which I used just before I walked in to the test. It helped to get my confidence up. If you are a beginner you can use the labs in the appendix to great effect. The self-test program that comes with is ok and need work. If you are used to Transenders or the Big Red Tests you will be disappointed. I did find several typos in the book and the self-test. This was confusing until I tested the commands out on my Linux box.
1,Defective product...don't waste your money!,"Received my product and it doesn't even work! VERY flimsy and cheap....very surprised by the product. Looks like something you could buy in the dollar store, but it's not even worth a dollar since it doesn't work!"
1,Carnivorous,"This is a film that has no redeeming qualities, well, except for fair special effects. The screenplay is awful, the acting is dry and empty and there are holes in the plot you could push a giant snake through... I rarely right reviews, but this film was so bad, I had to write a warning to anyone who might watch it, let alone actually pay money for it."
2,Mostly Re-makes,"I wasn't paying attention and bought this. I didn't realize it was mostly remakes. It's ok, but not what I was wanting. At least it was only 3.99."
1,Does not work,"I baught two of these to give away as safety awards, but it turned out they did not work. It would indicate lightning when non was around. I found out later the product had been discontinued from some websites. Amazon refunded my mooney. GO AMAZON.COM!!!"
2,Weak Power Switch,"I've used this for quite a while now, and it's accurate and very responsive to lightning strikes..... however.... (That's like ""BUT"") the power switch is the weakest link in this unit. It gets so weak that you have to apply a great amount of pressure to it, in order to work the functions, turn it on, off... or whatever. The company I bought it from has replaced one of them already, and now the one they sent is acting up the same way. They were cooperative in dealing with the problem, but customers want products that DON'T REQUIRE calls and replacements... they want RELIABILITY! Sorry to say, the switch in this unit makes the whole product unreliable. Since I only use this one season a year, it hasn't been ""over-used"" nor had exsessive use...VERY frustrating."
2,Ok,"I bought this for my 5 yr old, because of my love for storms and my wifes OCD hate of storms. It does work. He loved it. Me and my little buddy are storm watchers. It detects Strong electrical impulses, but as the directions state. It may go off next to electical items. Such as, useless in a car or anything with a motor. The fridge will set it off when it kicks in. Any large appliance or even a riding lawn mower will set it off or the computer. It does work outside though. We lived in the country and when you walked into the farmers field, away from electical items, it did work well. I would say it is good for outdoorsmen who have no way to see the weather channel, or no connection to the real world. Otherwise it is just a gaget.Sorry folks."
2,Strike Alert PLD,"It worked twice, then quite and doesn't even come on. Then, has NO customer support! Good concept though for ANY Electro-Static Discharge. I had even planned on using it at work (in Electronics Industry) and MY Robotics..."
4,"CLARKS MEN,S BRADENTON LACE UP ,TAN NUBUCK,9M","Item being reviewedClarks Men's Bradenton Lace Up,Tan Nubuck,9 M"
5,prompt delivery through express mail,I was very impressed as to how quickly I received my book. The added cost for express mail was worth it. I ordered Saturday and had the book by Wednesday.
2,2 pots and a wet vac,That's what you'll need with this product.I tried steaming fish in the bottom and frozen corn in the top. After 45 minutes the corn was still frozen and the fish was done. I then had to remove the lower section to cook the corn (20 more minutes).Also I've tried a couple different pots and they all release enough steam out the side that you end up with a lake on your stove.
2,Too small,"I knew two types of steamers before founding that one: the metallic, foldable, kind, and the Chinese bamboo steamers. The foldable ones are great for veggies, but because the surface is not flat, you can't really steam fish. The bamboo kind, which are usually two story high, are good for both veggies and fish, but can't be put in the dishwasher.So this one seemed to have the best of both world: flat surfaces, two stories, and dishwasher-safe. Unfortunately, it's just too small for steaming fish: while the diameter of the whole thing is 9.2'', the usable part is only 7'' in diameter. That means you'll have to cut your piece of fish into at least two to arrange them on the surface. Not good.I'm returning it."
5,I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU PEOPLE!!!!,"This story is totally awesome(sorry for the beach lingo!)! You could e-mail Penny if you have zondervans e-mail(back of the book), and she replies personally. Flabbergasted is also a good book though(0800718372=ISBN)! Also try ""Dear Bob""."
3,"Witty, but not hilarious","I'm amazed people think this is laugh-out-loud funny. The writing is clever, even witty, but many of the jokes fall flat. I think this book would be funnier if it weren't being marketed as a ""Christian"" novel, which it barely classifies as such. The characters are quirky, the language and story-line are clean and unoffensive, but the whole book is just so-so. Read ""Flabbergasted"" by Ray Blackston instead."
4,The pictures make the content easier to use,"Just starting out at Yoga, and needing visuals other than video, I found this book very adept at helping me learn the poses. I have learned which ones do best for my impaired mobility in my back, and will be eager to learn as many as possible to be more flexible. The great photos, and precise instruction, and optional adaptions make this a book I will be able to use from beginner to accomplished yoga."
1,Not for bad backs,Did not like this book. Most exercises in the book had cautions not to do if you had a back problem. Got the book to help with a back problem. Not good.
2,bad condition book,"i recently bought the ""maran illustrated yoga"". i paid the price for a new conditioned book. however, when i received book, the front and backcover were folded and the inside of the front cover had a long piece of tape. also, the inside cover had a couple of folds too. This is the first time that I received a book that looked used, not new."
1,I gave up half-way through this book,"Man, when people say this book starts off slow, they MEAN IT! I see what Donaldson is trying to set up -- unassertive Terisa gradually learns that she has value and self-worth and eventually stands up for herself, and Geraden finally leaves behind his klutzy ways and learns to be a man, and of course they end up a couple, yadda-yadda -- but I've given up on it because it goes so slowly. The imagery is nice, the through-her-eyes perspective is interesting, but I kept wanting to smack this girl upside the head and tell her to stand up for herself already. I even tried flipping forward through it and found no real action to keep me interested.If you're looking for suspense, intrigue, and intense, detailed descriptions, and you don't mind waiting 'til maybe even the end of the book for explanations of what's going on, this might be the book for you. If you're looking for action, adventure, magic, and most importantly, FUN, try something else."
1,This book will proably put most people to sleep.............,"This book was a real disappointment. I've read both Covenant trilogy's a couple of times. I would encourage anyone who hasn't read Donaldson to start with those books. This is a story of a girl with low self-esteem. She goes through a mirror to a medieval society where mirrors are used for magical purposes. She goes through various intrigues where she doesn't know who to trust. This story is very similar to the Covenant trilogies. The difference is that the Covenant series is extremely interested.Don't bother with this book, it is 622 pages of boredom."
2,Useless Ongoing drivel,What exactly was Donaldson talking about? I have no idea...merely sex-obsessed nonsense which causes the reader to yawn and snore. I bought a copy since I was recommended to do so by a Phantom phan... Nevertheless I regret wasting my moeny; thus you should not with yours.
1,Blatantly.... Revolting,"Heavy-handed vocabulary, women characters you can tell were written by a man (as each of them seem to fall susinctly into stereotypes without any variation at all - the dreamer/romatic, the mannish tomboy, the wanton hussy, the complacent waif), a main charcter dumb enough to make you want to beat your own head in, and a plot slower than molasses - with none of the richness to keep it engaging. The cliffhanger? Not enough to persuade me to buy the next book. Frankly, I can say that I only finished this one as I made the mistake of paying money for it."
4,Lighter than other Donladson but just as much fun,"I really liked this book and its sequel (continuation), they're well paced and interesting with an intelligent plot.All in all, just as well crafter but much lighter and happier than the Covenant books."
4,The mirror of her dreams,"Again, I have to give a big Kudos to Mr. Donaldson. When someone requests a book because they want to re read it, well that gets a high five from me."
1,Oh Well ......,"Thanks to the USPO my package mailed June 18 arrived July 9. The long awaited item seemed to be good quality and well made but was smaller than any other bra I have in the same size, too small to wear. This meant rewrapping, a trip to the post office and mailing cost. Since the Visa bill arrived before the order, it has been paid and now I am waiting to receive credit for the returned item and I hope, the original $5.95 shipping and processing charge........Oh well!"
2,Very scratchy feeling....not comfortable.,I was so disappointed in this bra! It has a border around it that feels scratchy and uncomfortable. I don't recommend this product.
5,Good fit,It arrive on time. It fits me perfectly and I am very happy with it. In the future I will be buying it again.
4,Gelmart Lace & Satin Mastectomy Bra,"Good mastectomy bra's are hard to find. Good quality at the price. The fit is good, sizing info spot on. Very fast shipping."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was really excited to purchase an instructional make-up video and boy was I disappointed. This video is very poor in quality-it looked like it had been copied from another video. Very minimal content to speak of. Very unprofessional quality. Look for another video-if I could have rated this video a ""0"" I would have. If interested in a book- Kevyn Aucoin's book ""Making Faces"" is very good with a lot of info and great pictures. And its alot cheaper!"
3,Email to the universe,Not quite his best however Robert Anton Wilson is getting a bit long in the tooth and fans have probably been pushing for more. I know I was eagerly awaiting Tales of the Tribe. The old man can retire now and rest easy...
1,Call the SPCA!,"In Kroll's biography we are informed that he does not own a dog. This is a good thing since the author obviously thinks that dogs are disposable. When the cute little puppy Kroll's picture book family brings home grows up to be an large, untrained dog the parents bring it back to the pound and return with yet another dog. The children and the dogs aren't happy, but the parents are firm that one dog can be easily replaced with another and the only thing that matters is that the dog not be underfoot. Luckily in Kroll's fantasy world the two abused dogs find their original owners. Unfortunately in the real world they would have both been euthanized. (...)"
3,good but...,"it is a good action flick but terrible story and dialogue. i am one who doesnt mind a little violence here and there, but let's have a better story. thankfully Arnold chose better stuff later on like Total Recall and T2.plus you can see the low quality of this film. there is a scene where he is attacking that big fortress and launches a 'nade at some soldiers coming to kill him. if you take it slowly, you can see the platforms that launch the stuntmen in the air quite visibly."
5,"So great, I created a website dedicated to it!","As a fan of the action genre, I've always held COMMANDO in the highest regard. Unlike the RAMBO films, Director Mark L. Lester didn't fall into the trap of taking his films too seriously. There is no overt political statement...just lots of killing. Also, Vernon Wells plays the wonderfully camp villain, Bennett. Since this is my favorite film, I also decided to create a website dedicated to it.HTTP://WWW.COMMANDOFANS.COM"
3,"He's back,with a little more front",Now i was a big fan of Arnold back in the day.so when i saw this i had to buy it.it holds up pretty well.the new 5.1 surround is good but the picture looks like its just been transfered straight from the video.as for the extra footage in the directors cut its not much to get excited about.most notable is the tool shed scene which has been fully restored.the original theatrical release is in there to so with the audio commentry and behind the scenes stuff to its just about worth it.
4,SCHWARZENEGGER DELIVERED ANOTHER HIT,"A RETIRED ARMY SOLDIER [ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER] GOES BACK INTO ACTION WHEN HIS DAUGHTER IS KIDNAPPED. SURE, SOME OF THE ACTION IS OUTLANDISH AND VERY UNBELIEVABLE, BUT IT'S STILL A VERY FUN MOVIE TO WATCH. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS MAY BE ARNOLD'S BEST MOVIE THAT CAME AFTER ''THE TERMINATOR''."
3,John Matrix Reloaded,"John Matrix... wow... it must've took a few hours to think THAT name up, huh? Okay, here's what I'm gonna do... instead of a review, I'm just gonna post a bunch of quotes :""Remember when I promised to kill you last?""...""That's right, Matrix, you did!!""..."".....I lied...."".....""AHGhghhghghhghHHHH!!!!!""""Put the knife away, and shut your mouth""""I eat green-berets for breakfast! And right now, I'm VERY hungry!""""=v(K you @55hole!"" *click* *click* ""=v(K YOU @55hole!""""Let off some steam, Bennet!""""I DON'T NEED NO GUN! * tosses the gun aside and whips out a knife* I GONNA KILL YOU NOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!!!""""He's one gigantic mofo!""""Wanna see me kick some @55?""Well folks, that about sums it up. Commando rocks."
5,Dead tired? Watch Commando and let off some steam,"Commando. The Arnie classic. One of the best films yanked out of the eighties, definitely one of the best action flicks ever.This movie has everything - the B movie feel, some bad acting, muscle, lots of corny dialog. And while the namby pambys of the world may think of these as characteristics of a terrible movie, those with balls (and sometimes even those without) will tell you that this is exactly what makes for an excellent film that you will watch time and time again.And you don't find me convincing enough, open Webster's dictionary and look under ""greatest action movie actor"". Nice Arnold pic eh?"
4,A satisfying actioner.,"Arnold plays loving father, ex-commando, John Matrix who's in hiding with his daughter. After an evil army kidnaps his daughter, Arnold goes balistic and has 11 hours to find her- before they kill her. Scary Reality: The movie was only written for an hour and seven minutes total. Happy ending: Steven De. Souza added twenty five minutes of non-stop action in the end, making it 92 minutes long. What Works: Arnold's cool stunts, one-liners, and the action. What Doesn't: Arnie's nemesis, Bennett, whom is unbelievable, and the lower level of action before the last half hour. And even at 90 minutes long, it still isn't long enough. COMMANDO (1985) Rated: R (Strong Violence, Profanity, Brief Gore, and Brief Sex/Nudity) COMMANDO is a fun action flick to add to the ARNOLD collection. 4 stars out of 5."
3,IS THIS A MOVIE OR A SATURDAY MORNING CARTOON???!!!,"I gave this cartoon 3 stars because of the GREAT action scenes but they were SOOO WACKED and SOOO unrealistic!!!!!This is a low budget film (or cartoon) that have a very cheap story about a soldier trying to rescue his daugther from a hispanic army of evil rebels, if he doesn't do what the rebels told him then his daughter will die unless he find another way to get her back. The 80's was a time of lame hero stuf! but if you want to see a good pro-america movie or cartoon then this one is great.If you like to collect pro-america cartoons then here are some popular ones:1- Rambo 2.2- G.I. Joe.3- Centurions.4- Rocky 4.5- The Patriot.6- Bloodsport.7- Independence Day.P.S: Don't get me wrong! this cartoon is GREAT!! but the action scenes are more like comedy than action. ADIOS."
3,comando,"COMANDO was always a good movie, just that the sound quality is not as big as the more modern movies."
4,COMMANDO,"Movie was in good shape. Not as many Direct Cut scenes as I expected. Unlike movies I have purchased from other companies, the quality of Amazon's film purchases are always much better visually and audio."
2,Childish and brainless action,"If it hadn't been for the -80s nostalgia and Arnolds boyish charm, I would have given this film one star less. Because everything else about it is really bad. The comic relief/romantic object-character has really corny lines, like ""These guys eat to much red meat."" Arnie gets surrounded by two or three dozen bad guys constantly firing machine guns - and manages to kill everyone in sight without getting a scratch. After approximately nine hours locked up, alone in a room, the kidnapped daughter gets the idea to go and check if the door is locked. There are so many stupid details in this movie, there is no time or space for anything else."
3,Good Movie,This is a good action movie. The acting is sub-par but who cares. It's about 90 minutes of Arnold getting his daughter back. It's a must see for any Arnold fan.
3,Pan and scan? I hope not!,I would consider purchasing this movie to add to my growing Bluray collection if it wasn't for the description containing the dreaded P&S (pan and scan?). I notice this on many of the pre-release descriptions of forthcoming releases and this deeply concerns me if true.
5,THIS IS THE ONE OF THE BEST ARNOLD'S FILM!!!,Arney like a SUPERMAN in this film. This film so spectacular and amazing!!! Bye it NOW if you did not saw it!!!
1,"The ""Plan 9"" of action movies","Except that unlike ""Plan 9"" it had a high budget, which makes it even worse. The screenplay to this *had* to be written by a ten year old boy: there is simply no other explanation. The much-vaunted ""action"" scenes are ludicrous in the extreme. Bad guys dropping like flies when Ahnold's gun isn't even pointed at them, and flying through the air from a wimpy little explosion at least 10 yards away. Like another reviewer said, this might merit 5 stars as a bad-movie classic."
1,BAD...,"The record for killing enemies is definitely set in this movies, by Arnold's character. It's a brainless production, aimed for his fans, who will buy anything coming from him. He thanks you all."
1,Weak.,"You'll see alot of reviewers who absolutly love this film (God knows why), but trust me when I say that this is one of the worst things to come out of the 80s (and that's saying alot). I don't even think it's worth it to write simply how bad this film is. Everything from the story, to the characters, to the music is simply lousy. At times I wonder if this movie actually had a script because some things are so dumb (like when the cops just leave Schwarzenegger's girlfriend alone in a big artilery wharehouse when they take him to jail) it boggles the mind that some one could actually write this. Alot of people may say ""who cares about story if the action is good?"" The thing is, the action isn't good. There is no real style and I can't think of a single scene that was truly exciting."
1,the worst action movie,"Commando is the worst action movie ever made.It brings shame to all of arnie's movies,The Terminator,T2 Judgement Day,and The Predator.The plot is moronic.Sure the movie has lots of action but it comes at a cost.There is no thought put into the plot. All it is,is running and gunning throughout the whole movie. Caveman Say:Uga bugga bugga ugga! Translation:All action and no plot make bad movie."
1,Don't be fooled! No special features on the Blu-Ray.,"After reading the reviews that amazon posted to the Blu-Ray edition page, it turns out there is no directors commentary or deleted scenes on the blu-ray version.So buyer beware!"
3,Movie: 3.25/5 Picture Quality: 2.75~4.25/5 Sound Quality: 3.5/5 Extras: 0/5,"Version: U.S.A / Region-AAspect ratio: 1.85:1MPEG-2 BD-25Running time: 1:30:15Movie size: 21,09 GBDisc size: 23,00 GBAverage video bit rate: 24.65 MbpsDTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 24-bit/48 KhzDD AC3 2.0 448Kbps EnglishDD AC3 2.0 FrenchDD 1.0 Spanish MonoSubtitles: English SDH / SpanishNumber of chapters: 24#Theatrical Trailers in HD#D-Box enhanced"
4,Awful but good,"Whenever I watch ""Commando"" I think of the ""McBain"" running gag character in ""The Simpsons.""This film is blessed with one of the most idiotic plots in the history of motion pictures, some of the worst dialog ever uttered by human beings and acting so unrelievedly bad that that Woody Harrelson would look good by comparison.All that aside, I've seen ""Commando"" about eight times now, and like it immensely. It is the perfect film for when you want something exciting to watch that wouldn't tax the intelligence of a carpet slug and which will make the most damaged intellect smile and then laugh out loud.Don't believe anyone who says that this film is anything but a comedy but watch it again and again and again. Definitely one to own."
3,Fun and action from the eighties,"This one is fun and truly one of the stupidest movies that was ever made. Schwarzenegger's accent is at its worst here, but this simply means more fun. There are so many plot holes in here that mentioning them would take you a full day. Justgo and see it and try not to think too much! (SARR)"
4,A classic in Arnold's collection,"Grew up on his movies as a kid, so I love all the cheesy lines and the way they make him seem invincible and ridiculously strong lol."
3,Action,I enjoy action flicks and this has a lot of action in it. Dawn is kind of silly at times in this movie.
4,Great action flick,The plot is good. My only complaint is the scene where Matrix jumps out of the plane. NO WAY! Other than that its a great movie.
3,Commando,This movie is OK at best and is not Arnold's best by far. If you are looking for a movie filled with explosions and are unfamiliar with shooting discipline then it is for you. I love 80's movies but this one is a rough one to watch. You will chuckle from watching because of the movie overall and its acting.
4,The REAL Cammando!,"This movie has lots of things that make you jump out of your chair. Shotguns...explosions...what not! This movie is one of Arnold's best! It will make you happy, sad, and moved! GET IT"
2,Arnold makes it not so bad a film,"Commando without Schwarzenegger in it would have been like the Bible without God and Jesus. He is the only asset this movie has. The camera always seeks to enhance his muscles. When he goes to save his daughter from some villains, he his much like John Rambo. There is no stopping him,and the last piece of dialogue says it all. A general asks: ""leave anything for us?"", and Arnold calmly says: ""just bodies"". END"
3,Not one of Arnold's best!,"Commando starts off as a great action movie, but as the movie goes on the more dull the story gets. I always say that what makes a movie is its ending, and this movie has great action, but gets very old. I swear Arnold must kill at least 50 guys at the end but get only a couple of scratches on him, that's what made me kinda dislike this movie, but thank god his next films were wonderful. Take my advice unless your a die-hard Arnold fan pick it up, if not just leave it at the counter."
3,"Really PATHEDIC, but good","This is a hard movie to review cuz it has its goods & bads. ITs really pathedic how bad the actting is, action is, & the humor is. The plot is so pathedic its laughable just like everything else in this movie. All the villians are lame, their acttings almost as bad as Schwarzeneggers. The action is so laughable the stuff in the Matrix is more realistic than this!Still..lol....I have to love this movie just cuz of how pathedic it is & how laughable everything is in it.SPOILER Heres what I mean. The tarzan thing in the mall, when arnold swings all the way down on the balloon? Or on the island when the soldiers look like they're blind & shooting cap guns. Or when arnold is trapped in the shed & uses the blades like hes William Wallace from Braveheart to chop the guys up."
2,One of arnold's worst,"Hey I'm an Arnold fan, and I gues it's a reasonable action movie. But don't expect to much from the special effects, (cheesy) or the acting (awfull), or the storyline (very thin)."
2,Pathedic!,"Man, this has gotta be 1 of the worst movies i ever saw in my life! Arnold was stupid & so was the rest of the cast. The plot is such a ""has been."" It's also a ""no-brainer."" All Schwartzenegger knows how to do is shoot people...he can't act. This movie was so pathedic & crappy that it was funny...w/ out even meaning to be. Thats how a tell a pathedic film from 1 that's not. The dialog is sooo lame its an insult to our intellegence. An example would be a line such as ""Please, don't disturb my friend, he's dead tired."" That is so stupid now that it's almost funny, for today it is. I bet in the 80's, when this movie came out....people were cracking up. Don't see this stupid film. Well, see it just to make fun of how bad it is, but that's about all it's good for."
2,Remember ven I zed zis is a good movie? I LIED!!!,"However, I'll be more than willing to up this review provided that it comes on Mystery Science Theatre 3000 (w/ Joel Hodgson hosting, of course). It would blow away ""Mitchell"" w/ Joe Don Baker!!!"
4,Rambo meets Arnold,"This movie was really great except for a few things,firstable as a viewer i find it offensive that arnold took onabout 50 latino soldiers and killed them all, or when bennit makes fun of the spanish soldiers at one point of the movie.Besides tha t the movie was gory enough for me and actional."
1,"Absolutely, Deliciously Horrible.","I couldn't figure out whether to give this movie 1 or 5 stars;either one would fit it just fine.""Commando"" is without adoubt the pinnacle of bad-movie-making.From all of Arnold's one-liners to never-ending ammo belts to literal swarms of mexican guardsmen who cant hit ONE(1) target with thousands upon thousands of hyper-velocity slugs, this movie HAS to go down in cinematic history as THE most mind-numbingly moronic, idiotic, cheesey, grotesquely fake action movie EVER.One of the ""best"" parts of the movie was when Arnold's character blew up an entire coastal complex with 2 claymores. I don't have to go into that because anyone who knows their explosives knows what a claymore does and doesn't do.""John Matrix."" Damn.I swear to God, a three-year-old could come up with a more realistic name...When it comes down to it, ""Commando"" should be owned by all who have a stressful job, need some release, or just want to laugh until it hurts.BUY IT!"
3,Ummmmm,"Well, it's a waaaay over the top Schwartzenegger film filled with things that just don't happen in real life. LOL Leave your brain at the door and just laugh and watch the pretty 'splosions. LOL"
3,commando dvd review,"commando is an excellent action movie for arnold fans however this dvd transfer is below par of some other fox titles. there is a significant amount of snow and digital messiness that can be quite distracting during some of the dark scenes and even in some of the daylight scenes. you might consider waiting for another version of commando to hit the dvd market due to the snow of the transfer. too bad, until then i will continue to watch my vhs version and keep my dvd version to trade at some store."
5,arrived fast,"I bought this for my son-in-law for a gift. It was easy to order and arrived quickly, before some of my other items orderd befor this one."
4,Lots of action,"A great 80's action movie. Arnold's strength displayed at its finest. Some scenes are cheesy, but the lines and premise are very entertaining. Good movie"
5,Straight forward Answers for the Straight & Narrow Catholic,Father Saunders provides straight forward answers to multiple questions in layman's terms. This book is a wonderful collection of articles answering a variety of questions. You can open the book to almost any page and learn something new about the faith in just a few minutes of reading. Questions and answers range from early Church history to bioethical answers concerning today's difficult questions. A wonderful book to have for young adults as well.
2,Not worth the money,"It constantly crashes on me (and I tried it on two computers). Sometimes it will open, but other times it will not. I found it impossible to rip DVD's of television shows with multiple episodes. Besides the fact that it is not intuitive, it kept saving the newly ripped episodes over previously ripped episodes. I was, however, able to rip one movie before it crashed the last time I used it. I would recommend downloading the freeware instead."
1,Podmaxx Doesnt work,Ive tried Podmaxx on a XP Pro desktop and a Visa Laptop. Does not work on either.Customer services asks the usual questions about operating system etc. but then disappears.Dont waste your money on this program.
1,Packaging Is Better than the Software,"In this case, the ""trailer is better than the movie."" I tried Podmaxx'08, the next release, on two machines. It would not install on a Vista machine, but did install on the XP machines. This software is not ready for prime time, as few features worked as claimed. I really wanted this to work and fulfill some of the claims."
1,Waste of money,This program should be shareware at best. Program is poorly written and designed and if you need to reinstall you have to contact the company and fax them a copy of the original cd. A lot of work for a product that was not ready to be released in the first place! Don't waste your money!
4,Fun toy,"My 11 month old likes to sit and play with this. It is good for babies that are not walking yet and are stationary. It is a wooden toy and very sturdy. Toys like these are usually pretty expensive, so this is a great deal."
1,Small and Poor Quality,"This toy is poorly made. I got one for a 18-month-old. It lasted only one day. When the child dropped the toy on the hard wood floor, the wire broke off from the wooden base and the base was chipped. This toy is smaller than expected."
5,Why didn't I ever read this before,"This book is one of the most beautiful and touching things I have ever read. The beauty of a truly Christ-centered life just glows off of the pages. If you doubt Mrs. Prentess's authenticity, find a copy of her life and letters. She lived the truths of this book and knows whereof she speaks. I would recommend it to anyone who longs to love God more."
2,Rediculous,"I am an avid KISS fan. This was to me more of a ""Let's do something no one else has done before and we can sell a lot of records"" type of thing. The feel, the power and the emotions that make a KISS song a KISS song were stripped from the songs themselves. I started out wanting to laugh, but by the end of listening to the cd, I was ready to burn it! This was an absolute disgrace to the greatest ROCK AND ROLL BAND EVER!! As far as being good musicians and having extreme talent and wonderful harmonies, Hayseed Dixie have it all. They just need to understand that there's NOT a fine line between ROCK AND ROLL and bluegrass, they are world's apart. So, do a soundtrack to the sequal of ""O'BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?"" and let KISS do the soundtrack to their own career.NEVER STOP ROCKIN'!!Stephen Trent"
3,Buy the AC/DC one instead,"Until you've heard your favorite band covered in a different genre, you never really know how good or bad their music really is. In this case KISS' music is for KISS only. Not country/blue grass. I think the one thing that struck the side of my head like a brick from a truck with a gun rack, was just how insipid KISS lyrics truly are. This is a fun album. Don't get me wrong, but KISS doesn't work in this arena. On the other hand, the reason why this band exists is AC/DC. Their first album of AC/DC tunes is excellent and displays how well everything works in the world of mountain music."
4,Talent and Fun,"Hayseed Dixie is bluegrass. They are some guys sitting around on the porch sipping shine and enjoying life.They also happen to be some great musicians. They can play with anyone.I don't know what went through their minds when they decided to take ROCK songs and convert those songs into bluegrass. Using only my imagination, I could picture a drunken Saturday night when they were sitting around saying, ""Hey, listen to this.""This CD is as fun as any of there other ones and played with as much musical talent. They are GOOD."
1,A Deliverance Nightmare!,"While listening to this album I felt as if the kid from Deliverance was gonna pop into my bedroom window with his Banjo and try to put the moves on me. KISS is three chord hard rock, no matter how these guys try, they can't make it sound good with a banjo and twangy accents. It's worse then their AC/DC hillbilly music. Unless you totally dig banjo music, stay away from this album. It's not funny, it's like karoke with a banjo."
2,It's about communication not design,This book does not cover design of the interface well at all.Not worth buying for design. Ok for how to talk to a user
5,Royal Purple Synthetic Engine Motor Oil SAE 30,"Very impressed, used the Royal Purple in my vehicles. It delivered the fuel savings and horse power as promised. Big yes on the horse power! So decided to add it to my mowers, etc. Mowers use less gas and are quieter.Real nice!!!"
3,Definitely Outdated for 2010,"Unless you are quite removed from all the technological advances of recent years, most of this book will seem second nature to what you already know about how the church can use technology for ministry purposes. Maybe at the time of it's writing it was helpful, but I found it to be too outdated to be of much use for me in 2010. I would suggest scouring blogs for information about the use of technology in churches, as they keep up-to-date with the constant changes in the landscape."
2,good art poor publishing,"Brian Rood is a very good pin-up artist, and this is a nice selection of his work. However, this is a magazine and not a paperback. SQP has cut corners with thin paper pages and covers. Search the web for the hardback though it is quite expensive."
5,"noticeable, held up to wind slight rain.","It was a pretty windy day when I put this sign up. It definitely can be seen from a good length away. It was easy to put in the ground and it did not get knocked over. I wish the white part to add words was larger because that was not easy to read from the street but otherwise a very effective sturdy item to use for a day or two and will stay in tact on a windy, partly rainy day."
1,hotch-potch,"A confused, and confusing, assembly of factoids that leave the reader with nothing more than a glimpse of the topic due to its overwide focus."
1,what?,"this might be the dumbest record of all time. nothing happens the whole time. it's amazingly uncomplex, lacking in teeth, style, or edge. it sounds like they asked somebody to make them sound like a mix of u2, r.e.m., the strokes, and every other tired cliche. it goes to show that a band needs more than a catchy name, cool rocker looks, and a new york city location. skip this one."
1,I wanted to like it - I really did!,"I purchased this item on sale and was so excited. The first one I received had a defective bobbin case and upper thread tension. Sent it back for a replacement. The replacement had a crooked extension table, a broken walking foot, and a defective spool pin (the spool FLEW off the machine when threading the bobbin). So I've returned the second w/o asking for another replacement. If this machine works out for you that is great. Just thought I should let prospective buyers know what I experienced. (Note: My purchase was not reconditioned but brand new. Go figure.)"
1,Singer's quality control leaves something to be desired.,"Bought it. Had it shipped to a friend in Kansas who brought it back to me in Mexico.Imagine how I felt when I discovered it had no instructions though I had checked Amazon's editorial review which stated that it came with instructions in English and Spanish which is one of the main reasons I purchased this machine.Since this was to be a present for one of the women in the Mexican fishing village I live near, I now have an expensive boat anchor I can give to her husband.This was Singers fault, not Amazon'sSinger finally came through with a manual 6 months later.Machine froze 1 week after starting to use it.Bottom bobbin mechanism stopped rotating.Took it apart, cleaned and smoothed the bearing surfaces and now the machine performs well execept for the vibration, which is to be expected in this weight machine.Save yourself some trouble don't buy a refurbished Singer machine."
2,Will never compare with a deeper peel,"Maybe this is ok for 20something year olds. If youre 35+, go for a tca 35% peel. One million of these peels will never equal one deep TCA peel. I can leave this on for 30 minutes with no peeling, burning, redness. Just not deep enough."
3,Not for me...,"I like glycolic acid better... this one burns a lot and makes my skin oily, clogs my pores, etc... I read that it is just temporary and that if you're willing to stick through the first week or two, it is going to deliver. Well, I don't know... 2 weeks is a mighty long time when you have people staring at the pimples on your face, thinking ""Shouldn't she have that mess under control by now?"" I don't have that kind of patience."
5,Results Right Away,"Both my husband and I saw results as soon as we rinsed it off. Immediately our complection was brighter. I could not believe the results!!! My husband works outside and has sun damaged skin, especially on has face and hands, he is two toned, Lol... Light body and darker face and hands... Anyway when we used the peel on him it brightened his face to match the rest of his body, literally! Love this peel!!!!"
1,These reviews CAN'T be serious!,"I've had this product for three weeks, I have sensitive skin so upon using this product for the first time I was extremely careful. The first time I used it and each time since there has been tingling and some slight burning but nothing extreme. I've used this three times a week since i've owned it. I decided to wait and write a review until I'd had ample time to review the results. Might I also add that my sister has also used the same bottle of product that ive used. NEITHER of us has seen any change in our skin. After reading these results I was really expecting something dramatic, especially after 9 treatments but absolutely nothing has happened. If it wasnt for the tingling and slight burning sensation I wouldn't have even known I was using the product. My advice is to find something else because I can't believe all of these people actually saw results."
1,Very UNhappy WITH RESULTS,No significant difference at all. Very unpappy with results. Have used product well over 8 times with nothing. Actually my skin became a little worse. Very unhappy.
1,No clear change,I used this product on a scare every two days since I saw no change for two weeks. as of now still no drastic change. I actually regreted buying this product.
1,UGH!,"Not only did this do NOTHING for me after 7 months (followed directions 100%), but it STINKS. It smells like sour milk. I would actually take a deep breath when applying this because it smells so badly. I tried and I tried, for seven months, hoping the results would outweigh the stink. I'm not sure how people are getting these amazing results. Take a look at the other reviews, and click on ""see all reviews by this person"", that helps in determining if someone is just padding the rating."
1,Doesn't Work,"I ordered this hoping it would go all out and just peel the skin on my face to shreds. I wanted the wrinkles gone, the sun damage, all of it. Well, I received this and put it on my face and left it on for about 10 minutes............................. nothing. It didn't burn, didn't peel, didn't do anything. I'm very disappointed."
4,Results after two applications,I was a little skeptical about using yet another product for my acne and blotches. The first application I felt a lot of tingling and slight burning. The second application was much milder. After the second application I had two co-workers and my husband state how well my skin was clearing. I don't hide behind makeup I go out quite frequently without so it felt really good to hear comments after only the second appl. I have used four applications so far and will definitely continue to use this product. Well worth every penny!!!
1,Did nothing for me....,"I purchased this product SEVERAL months ago. Gave it time to work. I used it as directed but...to date, have received no marked improvement in my skin's texture, tone nor any noticeable reduction in break outs. It did irritate my skin though....and it did burn. I do believe that was supposed to happen though, as spa peels have burned me as well...but...hmmm. it was ""ok"". Wouldnt buy again."
4,Good Stuff!,"So far I've used this product about 4 times (every 5 days) and I like it but I don't LOVE it. The very first time I used it I felt like I noticed a difference in my face but after the first use I don't really feel like I see a difference after using this product. But...this instructions did say that you really start to see results after the sixth application. I'm going to continue using this product though because I think it's better to have it than not.The first time you use it, it's amazing. My mositurizer seemed to sink into my skin deeper, if that makes any sense. I did get little white heads on my face the next day but I think that normal because the same thing happened when I got a facial at the spa. The white heads are very small and not really noticable so don't worry. Plus they go away in like a day or so."
3,no frills,"The machine as such is good.. that is if you are not looking for any frills in your machine.Unfortunately I had a few problems with my machine and had to return it. The main problem was with the sideways movement of the needle. The needle would get stuck to the left, resulting in a straight stitch (irrespective of the pattern selected). In all probability, I just received a defective piece and others may not experience the same problem."
1,Falls far short of expectations,"I've been a seamstress for 40 years but I cannot get this machine to do anything but sew straight stitches, no matter how many times I read the instructions. I guess it was not a reconditioning it got at the factory. Now I have to figure out what to do about it."
1,AVOID,This was a monster of a machine. It was difficult to thread and would bunch thread coming up from the bobbin. I'm pretty mechanically inclined and just could not solve the problem.I eventually replaced with a low end Brother machine and have been happily sewing ever since.
2,Not worth buying!!!!,"This DVD is not worth the money. First, the release date on amazon is 2006 but on the actual DVD it says 2003, you can see that it is not up to date. The sound quality is not good at all, I turned up my TV almost full blast and still has a hard time understanding what she was saying. Also, the instructor is not very clear and she only does the moves once, so it is very hard to catch on. It actually gets alittle boring after about 4 moves are done. I was expecting something alitle more upbeat and fun but this is not. I paid 12 dollars for mine and i don't think it was even worth that amount of money."
1,Egyptian Bellydancing for Beginners,"This is not a professional video and a very disappointing amateur instruction video. The bellydancer wears an outfit that covers her legs, making it difficult for beginners to see the correct posture and whether or not the knees are bent or straight. In addition to this, the sound quality is poor and the instructor speaks softly and without animation to encourage beginners. A better alternative would to browse lessons posted on youtube, than to pay for a video that really isn't worth it."
2,Not as great as expected,"Shirley Temple was great in all 4 scenes of this movie. If you're a Shirley Fan, get ""Baby Take A Bow"" to see a better plot. I think many get mixed up in thinking that this was a Shirely Temple movie becuase she was on the cover. But the main plot isn't even about her. ""Stand Up and Cheer"" is not one to see if you want Shirely Temple movie. There are other Shirley movies much better than this one out there."
3,first preformance at Fox,"The only reason I give this a 3 instead of a 1 or 2 is because Shirley temple is in it, but only for 10 or 12 minutes. This ""movie"" is actually a review, showcasing different acts, but I think Shirley Temple and James Dunn have the best one.This is Shirley's first performance for Fox, and she is absolutely adorable. Like other reviews there is a thin plot that brings these acts together. The President has appointed a Secretary of Amusement to cheer up a nation that is suffering during the depression. I think if you are a Shirley Temple fan, and like to follow her career through movies you would enjoy this one."
1,Stand Up and Leave!,"I love most of the Shirley Temple movies, but this one is NOT one! Shirley temple is in this movie maybe a mere 5 minutes and then it's history for her, as she never returns. And the movie is horrible! I viewed bad acting, poor lines, and one of the dumbest of all the dancing scenes that ever hit the screen. Really, this movie had nothing to do with her. They had her in the movie for some unknown reason, one in which I can't figure out. But when she finally did appeared singing and then dancing, it was so cute, as she was younger and very talented in her role and surpassed all these silly untalented and unknown actors. Movie is not intended to be a part of ones ""Shirley Temple"" collection, you can gladly pass this one up. Very disappointed!"
2,Stand Up and Cheer,If you want to watch a Shirley Temple movie DO NOT GET THIS ONE! She's in it maybe 3 minutes. This really isn't a Shirely Temple movie!! Very bad movie even if it wasn't touted as a Shirley Temple movie.
1,Shirley is SOOOOOO amazing!!!!!,"Oh I know it deserves a half star, but it's worth it for just that bit part of Shirley. It's the best dance sequence I've ever seen in all of her movies, she just overflows with so much cuteness it is unbelievable!!"
2,not one of the best!,"i watched this film and it was okay, but definitely not one of shirley temples best, i like her other films better. while all her childhood films seem to be corny, they are all enjoyable. this one seemed to be too slow for me"
1,The Stepin Fetchit Show???,"As other reviewers have noted, Shirley Temple appears in only a few scenes. The rest of the movie represents one of the worst productions of this era. The appearance of Fetchit gives us a peek at how bad racial stereotypes were in the 1930s--a foul, slanderous, and contemptuous image that shouldn't be shown to impressionable children.If you want to see Temple's best, then go out and buy ""Poor Little Rich Girl"", ""Curly Top"", or ""The Littlest Rebel"" and you'll understand why this little girl captured the hearts of the nation. On the other hand, this film should be renamed ""Sit Down and Shutup!"""
4,"Great headphones with good sound, fit & price",I bought these headphones for my husband to listen to music recordings. He is very satisified with the sound quality and fit. I personally like the price! Highly recommend.
5,These novels resonate with a lyrical beauty and sensitivity.,"In these two companion novels, Colette introduces and develops two of her most memorable creations -- Chéri, a handsome, but dissolute young man with little or no ambition, and his unlikely lover, Léa de Lonval, a middle- aged courtesan. The first novel vividly describes this relationship in all its various forms and stages, from its innocent beginning, maturation and joyful apogee to its painful disintegration and destruction.In the sequel, which takes place six years later, Colette poignantly describes how Chéri and Léa have dealt with their heartrending separation and what occurs when the couple try once more to reconcile."
1,Firewire does not work for Mac,"I should have checked the review here before buying one: I got in the same situation as ""kmaletsky"".This works with Mac via USB. I rate this ""*"" because it claimed to be compatible with Mac, and that it has both USB and firewire, but it didn't say that it doesn't work for Mac via Firewire.The alternative that works with Mac seems to be Macally PHR-250CC Aluminum 2.5"" USB + IEEE 1394 External Enclosure . I am going to try this out.Iogear Ion 2.5"" USB2.0 / Firewire Enclosure appeared to be a good alternative and I was almost going to get it but in the last minute I found that it does not boot on Mac."
1,"Tried it, returned it","I recently bought this on Amazon. After it arrived, I could hardly force the hard drive in, small items were falling out during this process. After connecting it using my USB connection, I did not see a thing. My computer did not recognize it. I tried this and that, in vain. I returned the item 5 minutes ago."
2,Misleading Title,"I bought this dvd after reading the 5 star reviews on Amazon. When I finally got it, I was sorely disappointed. Most of the stuff shown in the dvd aren't really sleight of hand tricks. They are more like lame magic tricks done with cards. Pretty boring and unlikely to impress anyone over 10. Then I went back on amazon and read the reviews by some of the other posters. Turns out, most of them only rated other Ellusionist products, and gave them all 5 stars. Seems pretty suspicious to me... Anyway, if you are looking for a dvd that will teach you how to do 'magic' tricks with cards, then buy this dvd. Otherwise, save your money because they sure as hell aren't teaching you beginner's sleight of hand."
1,Wrong Band,"Did the know two bands had the same name. I wanted the blues band named The Jimmies, but got this CD which is a Grunge Rock Band. Did not like it."
2,Dissapointment,"This is the second grater I bought. I use this type of grater for hard cheese like Parmesan. Some of the more expensive Parmesan cheeses can be as hard as wood.The first problem I encountered with this grater is that there is a lip inside the hopper that the cheese is forced against by the rotation of the cutting blade. A hard cheese will hang up on this lip, and you will end up squeezing the handle very hard without grating any cheese. This problem is relatively easy to solve with a file.After I removed the lip with a file, I ran into the second problem. This grater powders the cheese. It cuts really slowly.Over all, I am disappointed."
1,Copied,This book is a black and white copy (poor quality) that is outdated and not worth the paper is is printed on.
2,Everything You Need to Know Grand Bahama Island,"This was the first book ever that I returned. I did not even read it. First it looked like a book what was printed and put together at a local Kinkos. Second, the price was $25,which I would have been more then happy to pay for a real book. It's a shame if the contants were outstanding because I couldn't see owning a book that may fall apart."
2,Everything you need to know about Grand Bahama riddled with errors,"This book was moderately helpful in preparation for my trip to Grand Bahama Island, but after visiting the island and comparing what I learned there to what was written in this book, I realized this text should not be counted on for total accuracy. In addition to the numerous grammatical, punctuation and spelling errors throughout this text, it also contains some pretty glaring factual errors: for example, it says Grand Bahama Island is ""aproximately 75-80 miles long from the west end to the east end (depending on who you ask). The widest part is the center portion which is about 4 miles from north to south.""Well, the island is more like 96 miles long, and it is 17 miles wide at its broadest point. That's a pretty big discrepancy. It's also a flimsy, thin paperback. Given its $25 pricetag, I didn't think it was worth the money. One would be better off doing research on the Web."
2,Not for me,"Not a big fan... I'm still yawning and my eyes are still heavy. I got a noticeable head rush but I wouldn't describe that rush as ""energetic""... It was more uncomfortable than anything. Won't take it again."
3,Great but...,"First time I took this it was awesome. Had so much energy it was nuts.Second time I took it, I puked my brains out. Had a huge niacin flush, felt like I had a horrible sun burn. As soon as I vomited I was fine. No energy, though."
3,"NOT high-energy, JUST high in B-Complex","The product's disclosure claims 5-Hour Energy. I don't think so. I think it's just the name for the product. Does NOTHING for me, other-than I like it because it's liquid, and high-dosage of B-complex vitamins. No other ingredients listed on bottle, that I remember. Competitors tablets, of B vitamins, may be just as good, and probably co$t alot less. See for yourself; read Chaser 5 Hour Energy label for yourself. ALL OF THE AFOREMENTIONED IS JUST 'MY' HONEST 'OPINION ! '"
2,Loses charge after a year,"My husband bought this for our portable printer, which we barely used. Only 1-2x at a function. It was stored away, not plugged in, for about a year, and when we plugged it in to charge up, the battery was dead and wouldn't take a charge at all. Now we have to have the printer plugged in all the time if we want to use it. So much for portability."
1,Defective out of the box!,"After waiting close to a year to receive this battery, the battery would not hold a charge. I was told to use a more powerful charger! Contacted several battery stores and they replied with WHAT?"
1,HP PHOTOSMART PRINTER B Internal Battery for HP Compact Photo Printers,The Battery was made in 2005. I think that the charge does not last as long as it should. Need to update products. This is the first bad product I have purchased. I hope it is the last. I printed about 25 30 picture on 1 charge. It was supposed to last for about 80 picture. Not even close!
5,Portable printer battery,"The packing and box all state this battery is for Series 300 and 400 printers, but it works great in my AHP 516 printer. It is good for 75 pictures, but I printed over 10 before it quit. A good but, in my opinion."
2,Seems like sour grapes,"The author enjoyed cruises then had a moral revelation and now finds them terrible. Shocking news...The wait staff is underpaid (but for some reason is fully staffed from second and third world countries). Other news reports, the cruise ship medical staff doesn't have a fully functioning hospital. The cruises are not all inclusive and some items have extra charges. The cruises companies have a history of dumping (and getting caught).People who cruise, know these things. The revelations have been in numerous news reports. The safety concerns are what everyone should be mindful of when traveling with 5000 other people. People who work on cruise ships work very hard. Hopefully that work pays off for them in raising their standard of living. No real news here..."
1,Yellow Journalism at it's best!!,"You would do better to actually use the money spent on this book and buy a drink on your next cruise. Horror of horrors, the cruise ship industry is out to make money!!! Shocking facts such as these as well as those that pay for premium suites get extra benefits and perks (shocking) can all be learned from this book. The author did a wonderful job of investigative research by basing most of his facts by talking to a disgruntled waiter over dinner. Thirty cruises is not what I would call extensive experience in the cruise ship industry. One cruise ship had a problem with its' air conditioner so the author assumes that ALL cruise ships have a problem with air conditioning (or they just turn it off to save money). This book is a waste of time and money and I will continue to cruise despite his efforts."
1,Ross A. Klein depresses everyone,Have you ever hung around someone that is just depress and negative about everything. That would be Ross Klein. I have cruise many times and learned many things. I know the cruise industry is not a perfect world but this writing has nothing positive to say about anything in the cruise industry. Be on the lookout for him on your next cruise. He could make it miserable for everyone.
2,An easy read,"A bit self-serving, over simplfied, and in the genre of alarmist, ""National Enquirer""-type of journalism. At least it was a very easy read....finished it cover to cover in a couple of hours. Good airplane or beach reading material."
3,Cruise Ship Blues Review,"I was initially hesitant to read this book because I love to cruise. I am a cruiseline travel agent, my partner and I own our own Travel agencythat specializes in selling cruises. A friend gave the book to me so I decided, ""What the Heck!"". At first I felt the books Author, ""Ross Klein"" was doing too much complaining (maybe he didn't get enough comp upgrades?) and felt the information in the book was a bit dated. In the cruise industry, things change quickly! If you read this book, don't take everything you read as gospel, this is only one persons opinion of an entire industry. Happy reading"
2,so so,This magazine had way too many ads for diet pills. A few ads are ok but almost the last twenty pages had like ten different kinds. It turned me off. The articles might be educational but I won't buy the magazine anymore.
3,Only 6 issues a year?!,"I read every exercise and fitness magazine I can get my hands on. I train 6 days a week and am always looking for new recipes and ways to spice up my workouts. I DO LIKE this magazine. It has a lot of little tips and news bites that make it an easy and informative read....But, I do not think it packs enough info to make it worth the price. At only 6 issues a year it is far more expensive then Oxygen or even Hers M&F. And some of the models look skinny and untoned. The BEST fitness magazine out there is Oxygen with Hers M&F being second. Both are full of great tips and the models are real fitness competitors. Check out Oxygen before you do anything."
1,"One page of text, one page of advertisment","This magazine is awful.I just got my 3rd issue and they have been consistent with left page text, right page advertisment.I am going to let my subscription to this one lapse.The text is mostly lame ""news"" on nutrtion or exercise and sometimes you will get contradicting news on the same page. You also get some exericises and nutritional tips - but nothing you can't get in Fitness magazine or Oxygen for better value (I am subscribed to both those as well and I don't feel like I am wasting my money every time I get them in the mail). I cut out useful articles and paste them in my own ""Health"" scrabook. I do that with a lot of articless from Oxygen and Fitness - but so far I haven't used a single clipping from Fitness RX.This magazine needs some serious improvement. I am surprised with all the great reviews here (which is why I subscribed to it in the first place)My advice - don't bother."
3,So - So magazine,"I liked some of the articles... they are pretty open about sex and sexuality. Not MANY more ads then the classic fitness magazine considering it's usual bulky size.My problem was you could buy 6 of these magazines and about 70% of the information/articles were exactly the same, just the wording was diffrent."
4,DJ JUG's opinion,"When I heard Wink for the first time, it was a song called ""higher state of consiousness"", and I was hooked. I bought ""are you there"" and spun it at a frat party at my school, and it rocked the floor. I definitely recommend this track. It has a phat bass kick and tweaked out effects."
3,Learned about Philadelphia history,"The reason why I had to read this book was for a religion class to fulfill a bachelor's degree requirement. We had to pick a saint and write a paper about that person. I picked Katherine Drexel because she was a local girl. Yes, I live in Philadelphia. At the time I did not know much about the Drexel family or how the family developed their wealth. After the first few chapters, I got into reading the book and learning about early Philadelphia history."
2,just collection of refference manuals,"all I could say is that book is very poorly written , no connection between reader and writer, in may chapets ,they are just composed of a bunch of refference manuls that everyone can read for free from vendor , for example JAAS section is totaly useless ...JDK 1.5 is covered very very poorly ...it seems that book was written in a rush to get it out to market .."
1,"Lacks Focus, not much information about JDK 5",Chpater 1: Key Java Language Features and Libraries - the only chapter that talks about JDK 5.Waste of time to proceed further.
5,Excellent Text,"As a long time C++ database application developer, I quickly picked up the concepts and ideas presented in the text. Excellent programming guide... particularly in chapter 11."
2,"Unfocused, riddled with errors","This book is an unfocused collection of reference manuals that seem to have been thrown together with very little forethought. It's poorly organized, the code examples aren't all that intructive, and there are plenty of errors throughout the book. It isn't very useful if you're learning Java, and it's a lousy reference if you already know it. I suggest skipping it."
4,Golding's Simple Gift...,"Golding's first book was so wonderfully crafted of magical realism that I eagerly awaited his second. ""BG"" does not disappoint. The fantastic antics of Benjamin, and the completely molded characters he encounters challenge the reader to redefine his idea of ""beauty"" and to identify beauty in the simple as well as the grand. I particularly liked Golding's use of Jazz within the relationships of characters and as a vehicle of discovery for one character. It is a device that I am used to seeing in African American Literature. I did miss the cliffhanger quality that ended each of the chapters of his first book, but this is such a minor point. ""BG"" is a very satisfying read. Don't make us wait so long for your next book, Mr. Golding!"
3,Wasted Gift/Wasted Read,"If you like ""plot"" you'll like Benjamin's Gift. There were so many aspects to the plot of this story--it was at sometimes a historical documentary, at others a science fiction adventure, and others a book about sexual fantasy. Michael Golding has incorporated themes reminiscent of Charles Dicken's Oliver and Oscar Wilde's The Portrait of Dorian Gray. While there was a great deal of action--what I missed was character development. The characters were flat and were not believable. There was so much opportunity in my mind to create some quality introspection in the characters so that the message in Benjamin's gift (which is hard to find) could be a theme for all. My projected theme is the fact that each indivdual has specific ""natural gifts"" and there is an inherent responsibility to share those gifts for the greater good."
2,This is an easy puzzle not hard.,"Even though I will not give out the solution to this puzzle I must say that I've solved about 85% of IQ Collections puzzles as for the others well...I haven't bought yet...HEHE =D. The first impression behind this puzzle was that it actually was intimidating with a rope, a peg, and a ring to undo it from which I spent contemplating countless minutes trying to get that darn ring off that puzzle with no luck. Well...I was about maybe 2-3 hours into figuring it out the puzzle by twisting the rope in and through the ring and over the peg...etc...etc. Then suddenly the unthinkable happened...which seemed like a solution appeared to be more like an engineering mistake in terms of the puzzle falling apart. I then took the puzzle back to the store for a refund and also noticed other stocked puzzles of this same kind fell apart exactly the same way as mine did. As to my knowledge this is the worst puzzle you can give to anyone due to this malfunction."
3,Great movie for kids,Ordered this from the Bahamas and it was shipped international - got here in less than a week. My kids loves the movie and have watched it over and over again.
5,The Swan Princess,I purchased The Swan Princess for my granddaughter per her request. She loves the movie.
1,Swan Princess and Swan Princess III,"The original Swan Princess movie is delightful, for the most part, with catchy music, great voice talent, and an entertaining plot. My 4-year old daughter has watched it many times, role-plays the leads with her dolls, and has asked many questions about the plot which has led to some interesting discussions.The Swan Princess III, on the other hand, is dreadful. It is actually painful for me to watch. One character, Rogers, who is otherwise rather dignified in the other movies, becomes a love-struck idiot in this one--it's a cringeable performance, especially since the object of his affection, Zelda, is so morally bankrupt.Therefore, the while I definitely recommend the original Swan Princess, don't waste your money on the third installment."
3,Kind of disappointed,"I always expect so much from Garson Kanin, that I was surprised how let down I was by this book. I read it because the hit TV show SMASH is based on this book, but the book is nothing like the show, at all. So buyer beware."
2,Once upon a time,"I am sure that Garson Kanin's book about Broadway musicals was pretty snappy in its day- I am imagining sometime in the 50's and 60's. Some books still hold up, despite the changing times, but for me this was not one of them.I saw the TV series, which I loved, and eagerly awaited this book. I was disappointed. The story does not move along as well as the series, and character development is either weak, or unbelievable. I didn't like anyone very much. I know this is the ""in"" thing to have characters that are despicable- ie: Dr House etc- but quite frankly I was a bit bored."
4,Fun Item!,"It's definately fun to play. I find the long iron game and driver to be pretty realistic, however the chipping and pitching aspect is a little off. Putting is pretty good. I will definately use this more in the winter when it gets to cold for the range. Only dislike is that the ball already beat up the plastic and I only used it 2 times. Overall a fun item and definately a good way to take up some boredom!"
1,Don't waste your money trash!,"Horrible customer support! Product does not work! junk junk junk! We have a defective product, so that none of our computers will recognize the unit and customer support ignores our request for help. Don't waste your money!!"
1,A dumb book. one cent is overcharging,"The author does not hide his political bias in his lurid descriptions of many impressive Texan wheelers and dealers. His prose is almost purple, (""The morning was damp.""; ""His mustache, neatly trimmed."" ) and his chapters are disjointed. What is worse, he knows nothing about Texas inasmuch as he thinks East Texas is a desert. There are many far better books about modern day Texas heroes."
4,Sew right!,"As a novice sewer, I was looking for an affordable machine with features that I may want in the future. This machine did the trick. It is easy to make bobbins and to thread, comes with a mutitude of stitch patterns as disks that can easily be slipped into the cartridge holder. It's a solid machine with good motor speed control. The machine doesn't have the smooth mechanization of the more expensive models, but I'm sure it will keep chugging along for the sporadic use that I will give it."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,This is One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My mistake for not reading the reviews and product description.
4,"I-5Killers,Vol.3",since i'm such a huge EVERCLEAR fan I can not say a bad word about this album.EVERCLEAR's track 'blondes' is really amazing and overall it's a farely solid preformance from all the bands.A must have for EVERCLEAR fans alike!
3,Alatheas Rockettown Debut!,"When I heard that Rockettown was signing a bluegrass female group I was instantly excited. I had to get this album because their isnt alot of this type of music available. After hearing the album I just couldnt get into the whole album. It has very powerful lyrics that make you think but the music styl kind of goes all over the place. It does have a couple of good songs like ""Faithful One"" ""Smiled on ME"" and ""Emmanuel.""""Emmanuel"" is a great Christmas song talking about Jesus and his birth."
2,you get what you pay for,"they are cheap and actually look and feel like it, made in China (of course)."
1,Unbelievably BAD sound quality! Don't bother with these...,"Unbelievable! I am amazed at how many five stars these earphones have gotten.I was looking around today for some earphones when I noticed these, and the outragious ratings it has gotten! I have these earphones, I bought them over a year ago at some shop because my ipod earphones had broken and needed quick replacements. I gotta say that these are the worst well known brand earphones I've ever owned.All of my songs sound like crap when I use these earphones. Even the ipod earphones are ten times better than these on every level! And we all know how mediocre ipod earphones are!I'm not saying that you should spend 100 bucks on quality earphones, but I'm sure you can find better stuff out there. Save your money on something better, seriously! Don't deprive yourself of quality over a few bucks, not on this garbage!"
1,Insult to music Listeners,"I just recieved my earbud which i ordered through Amazon. And with the first few minutes, I was disappointed. The earbud sounds more crappy than cheap imitation earbuds sold by the roadside . I was suprised as to how horrible Joe satriani sounded using the 818LP.Music sounded flat without depth or bass and absolutely tasteless . Anyone who even looks for even basic listening pleasure better look elsewhere.I expected much more from a brand like SONY."
4,Good for the price,These are a good quality headphone. The only complaint is they feel a little weird in my ears. Other than that they have been great.
