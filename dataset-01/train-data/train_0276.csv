2,Disappointed,The toy is not as durable as I'd hoped. The backhoe comes off constantly. It broke easily. Don't recommend this.
2,Not like the real thing. Too flimsy.,"My four year old has a collection of these large Bruder toys. Bruder's DVD babbles on about how they are ""just like the real thing"" - but to be frank, given the premium price, they look the part but are made from the thin plastic that does not stand up to the rigors of outdoor play. I've given up on repairing them. Small items seem snap off with impunity and larger items just split (like the hopper beds on 2 dump trucks he has). Though my son's love for things Bruder continues - we are going to try and wean him off this brand and look for something more sturdier. As another reviewer mentioned - OK for indoors, but for sandbox and dirt pit areas, we suggest trying another brand."
3,Amazing Song...especially the ragga version,"Ragga and RnB A match made in heaven. Shola Ama's voice is magical on the track with red rat, and the reds playful kiddy ragga influence voice blends well with the soulful sounds shola ama spits put on this track. A must for anyones music collection, who consideres themselves a music listener"
2,Palm Headset Dissapointing,"I have a Treo 650, and wanted a headset that paired easily, didn't lose the connection constantly, and had good sound quality. Considering that this is made by Palm for the Treo, I assumed it would be the best choice. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. The cool-looking metal case is basically a throw-away, the piece that the headset must fit into for charging is just another small piece that can be easily lost (why can't you just plug a charger directly into the headset??), and the bluetooth pairing is constantly dropping.It is relatively easy to use, comfortable, and the sound quality is ok - though not that impressive. The rubber earpiece is constantly falling off as well.For the price I guess it's not a bad option, but if this is the best Palm can do I'm pretty underwhelmed.I guess this goes in-line with the Treo itself in my opinion...underwhelming."
3,Great earpiece-Horrible charger,"The Earpiece is fantastic in its size and weight. One can barely tell it is in place. Loud and clear conversation, as the phone and service allows. The problem was with the pen type charging stand. One can switch betweeen the Treo mating charger and a AAA battery base. (I thoght the idea to use a battery silly, but had to give it a shot.) The problem occured when I tried to put the Treo base back on, I found that the plastic clip that holds it in place had broken off after only one attempt. I followed the handbook as described when I removed and replaced so I feel this was a defect from the factory. My question is how many times will this clip hold up for someone that changes the base weekly or daily. In hindsight, I should have left it as is. Moving forward I have ordered two replacement bases from Plantronics, the actual maker of the earpiece. THIS IS NOT AMAZONS FAULT."
1,"DON'T BUY, DEFECTIVE","Even though I read the reviews here, yes I bought this headset and agree with the other bad reviews. It doesn't charge well and would only work when it wanted to. I am returning it back tomorrow at the palm store. Don't waste your time buying this defective piece of overpriced junk."
1,A waste of time and energy,"This headset is defective by design and/or manufacturing. I recieved two units, one to replace the other, and both had the same problems with charging. One unit gave me hope by charging once, but then never again. I honestly think this product should be recalled."
1,"If I could rate the item with Negative stars, I would.","DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. It was overly optimistic of me to think this product would work dispite the other review. The headset would not charge with the included charger. The charger included was a joke, one of the poorest designed products I have ever seen. To make this set up work in anything other than perfect conditions would take an act of god or like diety, or liberal use of duck tape and rubber bands to maintain charger connection. But hey, it looks cool even though 2 cans and a string are more effective."
4,music to and for your ears,"mr. porter definitely knows his way around the key board. his touch is light and gentle .he has the ability to make you lean in and listen. I highly recommend this cd as well as his others, to any one in love with the piano.Lori Scala ( song writer )"
4,This stuff helps me sleep!,"This is a natural, safe product that helps me fall asleep. I have found that the lozenge works better than a pill. I can highly recommend Melatonin for anyone having trouble falling asleep who doesn't want to go the ""drug route""."
5,Amazing,"The color on the web site looks a little dark so i was really worried about it. The trash can came wrapped awsome, my[...] is having a blast in the styrphome box made for the trash can. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recomended this item!"
2,1 yr is all you get,This can has done everything advertised. Went through 2 rounds of batteries in 1 year which is actually quite good. The motor died almost exactly 1 yr to the day I bought it. $200 a yr for a trash can is too steep but it was great while it lasted
2,Jeff Skogsbergh? Gimme a break !,"I dunno, any review by Mr. Skogsbergh is suspect...This is the same Skogsbergh that gave 4 Stars to ""Tiny Tims Greatest Hits"""
4,A classic study of totalitarian political organization,"This is one of the oldest books on National Socialism. It is also one of the best. It is unique because it covers the organization and structure of the state, a field that is far less widely covered than the narrative history of the regime. The book contains detailed studies of different aspects of the Nazi state. People who want more information on this subject might want to go to my profile and check my Listmania books on totalitarianism and German history."
4,Behemoth,"Good book --- Often over my head on matter I know little about --- Law for example. That's a plus however, being over my head, because I would rather struggle through something and haved learned something than to breeze through something and learn nothing. I'd say if you wish to know something of National Socialism --- this is it."
5,Kim English Re-Re-Re-Energized,"Even though I wish Kim English would have come out with an album of new material, this collection of (mostly) new remixes is definitely enough to satisfy me until she does. Even though English was definitely on top of her game when she recorded these songs, this album is more about the remixers. These songs were recorded over 2 years ago.The strongest remixes, in my opinion, are the Junior Vasquez restructuring of ""Learn 2 Luv"" and the new Wamdue remix of ""Been So Long"". Kim's voice is so jazzy and perfect for these remixes. She is definitely the dance diva of the moment, but for her career's sake she needs to come out with new material so her label will stop issuing remixes of remixes of her hits!"
1,Nasty rave mixes of great soulful house songs,"It's a shame that Kim English's record label have commissioned such a dire set of remixes. In their original form (on the ""Higher Things"" LP), these songs are soulful house tunes. Almost all of these remixes strip out the subtle melodies and replace them with grating noises and effects, often obliterating Kim English's vocals in the process. Avoid this LP and buy ""Higher Things"" instead."
5,DVD IN America Yet?,"Want to buy the DVD, but from what I can tell it hasn't been released in America yet. Am I wrong about this? If not, do we know WHEN the DVD is set for American release?"
1,not worth $2,Ok idea but REALLY didn't buy any of it. Save your money for Doctor Who or a good book--try the Kate Daniels books by Ilona Andrews!
5,Life on Mars - Life is a Rock,"This was a very good episode. It had all the requirement of suspense, mystery and logical outcomes. It helped to explain, somewhat, why this fellow was in this situation and gave him the possibility of escaping from it at least eventually. I enjoyed the series and was disappointed when they decided to end it so quickly."
5,Another new entry on my favorite ever list.,I can't say more than this is what TV at its best does! I love it. You must watch it. Now.
5,An Amazing Journey,"The premise of Life On Mars sounds strange - a modern day cop has an accident and wakes up in 1973 - and it could have misfired very badly. It doesn't, though! John Simm is perfect as DI Sam Tyler, the modern cop who's suddenly policing a very different Manchester. He brings the right mix of vulnerability, confusion and depth to the character. Is he mad, in a coma, or has he gone back in time? he doesn't know, and neither do we.Philip Glenister plays DCI Gene Hunt, Sam's new boss in 1973. He's crass, foul-mouthed, sexist, bigotted, and has an insult for everyone. He's also corrupt, but he's not the bad guy...everything is shades of grey.Life On Mars is a fascinating show. On one level it's a cop drama, but there are a lot more levels underneath it. Add to that a fantastic soundtrack, and it's a show you will watch over and over again."
2,Can't relate to the British version of the series,"I bought both of the British series DVD's because I loved the American series. I give the American series a 5* rating. The storyline, the interaction between the characters, the details in the scenes, were all great. And I loved the American nostalgia. I just couldn't relate to the British version, probably because I didn't grow up there. The British version (original one) is probably just as good for them as the American version is for me.Paid $47.99 for Series 1, $42.99 for Series 2, and shipping was free. Purchased on 02-18-2010 directly from Amazon."
3,Not quite the same experience in the UK,"It's very cool going back to 1973 when you can relate to all the vintage Americana.When your in the UK the 1973 experience isn't quite as stunning.Good show; sadly the American version which was great, wasn't renewed and just ended unceremoniously lickity split.Bummer man..."
5,A must-see,"Life on Mars revives Britain's 70's with a dry humour, direct violence and absolutely great lines. The episodes (almost 1-hour each) leave room to a slower (but more solid) pace than Life on Mars' american version (45 minutes episodes). Great fun !"
5,Make sure you watch all the bits!,"Starting to watch the entire 16 episode 'mini-series' now, as we'll call it, I noticed in the first episode alone a few details important to the finale'. So make sure you watch each episode closely! The idea was a series that'd run on for many seasons and so they took off in a couple of directions - never intending to give away the ending as quick as they had to when the series abruptly ended.So in the first seasons and the start of the second, you gets hints and twists but never the real answers - til the finish."
2,"Fantastic show, but Region 1 be warned...","I ordered the blu-ray...but was shocked to find that that the ""region free"" disks only allowed me to access the episodes (commentaries) and not any of the extras. So if you want extras do not buy the blu-ray."
5,Its good,Works like its supposed to and is a good quality. I have used it a few times and no problems.
3,"hm,...","This product might work for a small door, but my door is much too heavy. It nearly rolls right over it. However, the product is as advertised. I guess I didn't realize that it was hollow inside."
1,Very Flimsy; Junk,"This is very small and flimsy and is unable to withhold any sort of pressure before folding it up, rendering it useless as a door stop."
1,Flimsy door stops,"Remember, you get what you pay for. In this case, very unsatisfactory door stops. The door weight actually causes it to bend. They weigh about an ounce and are useless."
4,Late '80s R&B At It's Finest!,"I was always a big fan of Rene & Angela in the '80s. When they split, both of these artists went solo. Back in 1988, when this album was released, I picked up ""All Or Nothing"" on 12 inch single. I was lucky and found a new & sealed copy of this album, so I picked it up. You can tell who the instrumental influence was on Rene & Angelas past albums. His music has a nice slammin' rhythm to it, and that trademark funky synthesizer lets you know that Rene is in the house! There are some slow jams on this album, but his up-tempo songs are the best offerings on this album. Angela Winbush went on to record albums through the '90s, but Rene didn't seem to offer any more releases except this one, which is a real loss. Rene Moore had an amazing musical talent. His music makes you want to get up and dance! If you like '80s R&B, this album will not disappoint!"
1,Love the Song but...,I love this song but the downloaded Amazon file is all over the place. Up and down the volume range. Fades in and out. The one star rating is for the technical problems. I would give it a four star for the song. So sad since now I have to go to Youtube to hear the whole version even though I have the Amazon download. :(.
1,Humor Takes More Ihan a Deceiving Title.,"I was disappointed with this book. I was looking for some humorous approach to the challenges of old age as the title suggested, but I found a collection of short stories that really did not make me laugh."
1,Ordered and told in stock and never recieved,"I ordered this for a birthday, recieved email that it had shipped and one that it had been discontinued so i called the company about it left countless messages trying to figure out if i was recieving it or not since i had recieved a tracking number and no return calls and never recieved it."
5,A Pure Gem,"I recently had the pleasure of seeing the revival at the Kennedy Center and was blown away by this show. Totally delightful, beautiful score, warm, witty and engaging book, marvelous performances, all made it a memorable evening.I had forgotten what a masterpiece of theater music this is. Her Face is one of the most gorgeous ballads written for American musicals. The carnival numbers are all catchy and rousing and the novelty pieces for the puppets are terrific. What a thrill the original production had to have been!"
4,Carnival,"Frankly, I've been spoiled by Ed Ames' version of ""Her Face"". Though this cast does a good job I just didn't feel the same emotion flowing from the voices. I knew the story but I'm disappointed in the quality of the songs. They seem superficial. Still, Carnival has lasted for many years so I can recommend it to anyone interested in vintage musicals."
4,Dreams from the Upper Shelf,"Having somewhat vilified Bob Merrill in previous reviews, I thought I should give him credit when he got it right. And he did, big time, with his 1961 score for ""Carnival."" I can't say it's one of the great Broadway scores of all time, but it's splendid nonetheless. The simplicity and warmth of the story seems to have brought out the best in Merrill. Song after song, the score is fresh, exuberant, clever and emotionally rich. Credit is due as well to a committed cast, most notably Anna Maria Alberghetti who perfectly personifies Lili's naivete and heart.The image of ""Beautiful candy, too pretty to eat"" is a perfect one for the score of ""Carnival"": It's sweet, delicate and lovely; a treat to which you'll come back again and again."
4,Underrated classic!,"I uncovered this gem in my local library, only to discover what a neat musical it is! I've never seen it performed onstage, which is too bad--the music is great! Ms. Alberghetti has such a nice, ""legit"" voice, contrasting with the hilariously bawdy, strong Kaye Ballard (""Humming"" is probably one of the best overlooked songs in this genre!). Another thing I really liked was Jerry Orbach's singing--he has two angry, difficult songs, and does a masterful job with both. To sum up, this is a fantastic album for anybody who likes old-style musical theatre. It's not slickly produced, but it is well-sung good music that tells a compelling story."
5,A Classic waiting to be re-discovered,"If you love the gentle charm of classical musicals, give this a listen. Alberghetti and Orbach are superb, as is Kaye Ballard. The score is uncommonly tuneful and conveys the emotional content of the script very well. It clings to the memory. My favorite tracks include Her Face and She's My Love. Again, Jerry Orbach's performance, as recorded here, must have been mesmerizing."
3,The Invisible Man Book Review,"I am rather torn between thoughts about this book. The plot was well written and it kept me guessing. However, this is the first book that I have ever read where the main character is not what main characters usually are: good. I was momentarily shocked when this particular fact appeared.Overall, this book was well written, though it boggs down every once and a while and makes it slightly dull. The subject matter didn't especially appeal to me, though. I didn't think that this book measured up at all to H.G. Wells book ""The Time Machine"", which I greatly enjoyed."
4,ok,it was pretty good- as scientist finds sumthing to make himself invisible but that backfires on him even though he thought he could get away with it.
3,It was OK.,"The Invisible Man was neither bad nor good. I never really got into the story and some parts were just plain confusing, but it's probably just me. Give it a chance, maybe you'll enjoy it."
3,Interesting testimony,"The book is boring. The idea is wonderful, to become invisible is the worst of nightmares, but that's all. It is not science fiction, it's a moral tale about good and evil, very conservative and sometimes dull. It's interesting to see that in Well's era things were so diferent. Now, an invible man would be powerful just as it is in eality."
1,Do Not Read This Book,"I would not recommend this book to my worst enemy. The book is extremely hard to follow and does not appeal to me at all. I would not shed a tear if no one in the world ever read this terrible classic again. The time I spent reading The Invisible Man was nothing short of cruel and unusual torture. People who would enjoy this book are people who enjoy books that are difficult to follow, make no sense, and are boring. The idea about becoming invisible is the only reason why I read this book. However, the book does not make the fact the man is invisible interesting. People who would not like this book are people who want their stories to make sense, are easy to follow, are interesting, and do not want to waste one minute of their life reading it."
4,My favorite book by H.G. Wells,"I have read most of the popular works of H.G. Wells (The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, The First Men in the Moon, and The Island of Dr. Moreau) and this was my favorite. The Invisible Man is an entertaining book, but what it really makes you think about is WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU COULD GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING? Is man inherently EVIL, and simply obeys the constraints of society because he is afraid of getting caught, or is man inherently good? This is the question that Wells tries to answer in this book, and you'll find the book well worth the time. I recommend this book to all lovers of good science fiction; enjoy!"
4,Great value for unabridged version,"It's very compact and good to take with you to read anywhere. The text is pretty small and a bit hard to read sometimes but overall for the price, I'd recommend buying Dover Thrift editions in the future for other classics."
4,Classic Science Fiction,"In this classic by H.G. Wells, a scientist has turned himself invisible and now just seeks food, clothing, and shelter from the cold. The power that he has received from his invisibility combined with his arrogance drives him to want more and more, until he reaches a level of insanity.H.G. Well's makes this man a stranger to those around him, and does not portray his character very sympathetically. He uses the science fiction genre also in a unique way, by not creating a world with cultures and lifestyles changed by technology over time, but a small town effected by sudden exposure to a man changed by science. Plus, Wells uses ordinary scenes and transforms them by having his characters convey unexpected actions and reactions.Wells 19th century English seems outdated, but dosen't keep the reader from enjoying the great adventure."
2,Not designed for the Flyfisher.,Very little information is inserted that is of benefit to the flyfisher. Classifications are outdated and most of the text is complicated and useless. Some of the pictures (drawings) were great. It helped in identifying some of the basic insects.
2,Surprised by a dud,This is the first Nora Roberts audio casette we've found disappointing. It lacked the usual depth of character development and left loose ends for no apparent reason.
3,kind of boring,"I guess if you want the history it's cool. If you have seen other snowboarding videos with actual snowboarding this one is pretty boring. 75% interviews and bs and very little actual riding.The actual riding is pretty cool though. The riders are awesome, the video is just a little slow."
3,"Not horrible, not the best.","This movie was recommended when I purchased the Art of Flight.. It's not at all what I had expected. It is interesting at times, but pretty lame at others."
3,"Slow movie, AWESOME ending",This movie was good. I was surprised to see how old it was being that Shaun White is only 18. It was a decent movie goes back on the history of snowboarding and switches back and forth to AK with Shaun and the crew. Terjae made this movie at the end with the first decent and it was SICK!!!
4,Grat movie!,"Great movie, accomplishes just what it proposed to do, present the story of 5 top snowboarders in Alaska, while also explains and tells the story of the snowboarding phenomenon."
5,necessary movie for snowboarders,"I ordered thie movie in USA because i could'nt have it in europeFantactic documentary about snowboarding with big champions ! i begun starting this sport 3 years ago (i am 41) and i want to do it for all my life ! thank u Shaun White, Travis Rice and the others to give me all of this energygood quality image & sound"
1,Another rock book that fails to rock,"At the end of reading this thankfully short book I knew almost nothing about Gentle Giant that I did not know already.I was left with no idea of the relationships between the band members, three of whom where brothers, and even less about the way these very talented individuals put their music together.I own all the GG discs available and have been a fan since first hearing them in the seventies, this book does not do the band and its music justice in any way shape or form."
3,An O.K. Book About A Knockout Band,"I would have preferred something that went track-by-track, album-by-album (like ""In The Court Of King Crimson"" does about that band.)This one goes off in other directions and isn't edited into the clean, neat chapters.It does offer insight into a band where so few books exist (that I've found.) So it's good for that reason."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This book is incredibly trite and condescending. Even for the few worthwhile tips I was able to get from reading this book, the price is still ridiculous. If you want a good book on writing a script, try reading The Art of Dramatic Writing by Lagos Egri--it is tailored to playwrighting, but can be easily applied to any kind of writing."
4,Very Happy,"I bought this CD to listen to ""A Song for Mama"". My fiance was thinking of using it for his mother/song dance. We decided on another song but I am still happy that we purchased the CD. I don't own much R&B so it will add to my collection."
3,Wonderful group....sorry dedication of an album,"I love Boyz II Men. Call me a softy, whatever, but I love how they epitomized what I would want to sound like if I sang to the love of my life. I know they've slipped, and I'm the first to admit it, but I still follow their every move. I hoped that when they did come out with a greatest hits, they would incorporate songs from all angles of their career. However, this shabby compilation leaves out songs from side projects, like 'Your Home is in My Heart' and 'So Amazing', among others. In my opinion, 13 songs is not quite enough to truly give tribute to the group and give resolve to their fans. I've taken the liberty of making up my own greatest hits of the group, which has 2 discs of songs, much more worth it than this junk."
2,Dull!,"Wow, another collection by another boyband gone sour. Yes, they have the harmonies. Yes, they've got the voices. But, what they don't have is material worth listening to. Over the past decade (or their 5 years at the top), they have provided us with the most inane, dull, and unimaginative singles since, well, Mariah herself. But, the utterly mundane ""One Sweet Day"" couples both rather dull hitmakers, in a successful attempt to cash in on mid-90's contemporary fluff. Boyz II Men, including Mariah, have contributed to the decline of R&B over the past decade."
1,Bad II Worse,"The members of Boyz II Men may seem like gentlemen and all, but they have released some of the dullest singles of the 1990s. Safe, professional-sounding Black pop for the masses. Sure, they can sing, but so what? The music is a snooze. This collection gets the big one star mainly for ""One Sweet Day,"" one of the very worst songs ever recorded. Not even legendary producers Babyface and Jam & Lewis can conceal the Boyz's blandness. ""I'll Make Love to You"" and ""On Bended Knee"" are as predictable as Christmas Day. Only on the single ""Song for Mama,"" do we get signs of life. While I can't call Boyz II Men the worst r&b group ever, this hits collection is nothing more than an example of soul music without the soul."
2,Just okay,I didn't like the CD as much as I thought it would. I should have just bought a song or two.
5,Greatest Legacy,"This is an absolute must-have for ANY Boyz II Men fan! It has (almost) all the hits (i.e.-End Of The Road; One Sweet Day; Bended Knee; Hey Lover; It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday, etc.) that any Boyz II Men/R&B/music lover will love-guaranteed! Though their official website says there is 14 tracks, there's only 13, them being:1. Motownphilly2. It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday3. End Of The Road4. In The Still Of The Nite (I'll Remember)5. Hey Lover (w/LL Cool J)6. I'll Make Love To You7. On Bended Knee8. Water Runs Dry9. One Sweet Day (w/Mariah Carey)10. Doin' Just Fine11. 4 Seasons Of Loneliness12. A Song For Mama13. Pass You ByI recommend that any/everyone get this CD cause it is well-worth your money!!!"
4,Remember the 90's,I love this album! Reminds me of all those songs I listened to in high school and brings back memories. I recently went on a road trip with my sister and it was great to spend the entire time singing along. While her son didn't think it was great we had a blast! Thanks for the memories!
5,music rebuild,A must have if you love Boys II Men. Has every great song I wanted! Fast shipping and great qaulity cd with jewel case
1,Boring !!!,"Despite the stars in this movie, it is a very boring affair. Hoods is about a wise guy played by Joe Mantegna who is assigned by his father to kill somebody by the name of ""Carmine Delaroza"" who turns out to be a 9 year olds kid. Despite being sold as a comedy, this movie is not funny. The DVD is in full screen. No closed captioning (despite there is a CC on the back of the jacket). No Dolby 5.1 either. The picture quality is OK. Avoid this. Not worth it."
3,Enjoyable,"A good read. Engaging and well constructed. The times are well captured and a story well told. Not deep, but entertaining."
4,Excellent telling of the Iran Hostage Crisis,"For those interested in history and especially the history of the relationship between Iran and the U.S., this book is essential. This book is well written, fine storytelling, and appropriately detailed without belaboring the point. Probably the best one source history of the hostage crisis. Some may find it a little too charitable to President Carter, but it appears to be a fair portrayal."
5,Pulitzer-worthy,I have no idea why this book did not win the Pulizer Prizer.Easily the best non-fiction that I have read in the past 10 years.
5,Great scholarship,"Bowden writes another great text with solid research and scholarly analysis. This is an exiting look at the 444 days of the hostage crisis. It is not another political blame book, but an honest approach to the actual events. Bowden has an ability to immerse the reader in the unfolding events as if he or she is there, while being able to provide a clear and well reasoned history.This book also has the benefit of being very timely and shed's a lot of light on Iranian culture and modern times."
3,Iran Hostage Crisis,"Having just returned Iran, this book refreshed my memory of the hostage crisis. It's long but interesting. The author does a good job of relating the events that led up to the taking of the American embassy and the subsequent events until their release over a year later. The book is 650 pages. The story could probably have been told in 400 pages; I'm not sure we needed to know everytime they were moved and their daily activities (or lack of). His ending comments about Tehran are outdated. The people in Iran today are very positive about Americans and Tehran, while still congested and polluted, is a thriving ""developed"" city. The parks are glorious, unlike his ending comments. Visiting Iran was one of our best trips ever. We felt safe and the people were remarkably friendly. Anyway, the book is worth reading if you're interested in finding out more about the hostage crisis."
4,Sometimes words are just words,"This book is a timely reminder of times past. Mark Bowen has done some heavy research and presents the action regarding the take over of the US Embassy, in a sharp and focused manner. In light of the situation in Iran now and the postion taken by the present Prime Minister, he missed a chance to follow up his role in the take-over. Mark gets very tied up in making sure we know every detail and so loses the essence, the ""feel"" of a scene. All in all, this is a worthwhile analysis but I believe that it would benefit from being about 75 pages shorter."
4,Guests of the Ayatollah,"I am old enough to remember the incident when it happened, but this book filled in a lot of details that I didn't know or remember. The author weaves in the personal stories of the hostages from interviews and other writings. Very good. I recently saw a series on Discovery Channel about the book, which was also well done but in less detail."
5,Yes!,"Another interesting, informative and well written book by Mark Bowden. He is able to gather reams and reams of ino and put it into an easy to read format."
5,Mark Bowden writes history and we read it as if it was fiction,I am a Fan of Mark Bowden every one of his books read like a fiction book even though he writes about real life!
2,Disappointing,"For someone who loved Black Hawk Down this book was a huge disappointment. Very slow moving, excessively detailed and ultimately boring, I am sorry to say I gave up before the end."
4,Very Good,"This is a very well researched and written book. I was always reading it (so don't expect to get through it quickly). This is Bowden's second best in my opinion (to Black Hawk Down). Read it over Killing Pablo, Road Work, or Doctor Dealer."
2,Disappointing,"This book is essentially a detailed repetition of the same set of circumstances from the point of view of each hostage. It's a good book but if it was twice as long and included more details of how the crisis impacted more people, it could have been a great book. Perhaps Bowden is saving something for another book."
3,Long and Unwieldy,"Mark Bowden's ""Black Hawk Down"" was not memorable, but it was not incompetent either. It was a quick and satisfying read, and the construction of the ending -- about how an American pilot was captured, treated well by his captors, but ultimately portrayed as a victim -- is devastating in its poignant truthfulness. ""Guest of the Ayatollah,"" obviously the work of a much less mature Bowden, is painstakingly researched and its construction is as close to actual events as possible, but it is also a burdensome and unsatisfying read. There is some nobility and a little heroics, but there is far more arrogance and whining. Reading it with the perspective of what's happened in Guantanamo Bay, sophisticated readers would also have a difficult time feeling too sympathetic towards the American hostages."
2,Don't read this review,"because I bought the book after reading the hype, expecting that the coverage of the Delta One and Eagle Claw missions would be thorough. I went to high school with one of the C130 pilots who died during this mission, and I wanted to read what happened to him. Unfortunately, Bowden couldn't find a way to include the identities of all of the eight casualties, and when I realized that, I put the book down and will not read it. I apologize to the readers who enjoyed this book- my expectations were not met, and I refuse to read it. The omission was too much for me."
4,An Excellent Look at the Iranian Hostage Crisis,I am generally a fan of Mark Bowden I enjoyed Black Hawk Down and Guests of the Ayatollah is no different. The book goes chronologically through the hostage crisis starting with the day the hostages were taken. The book is told from the viewpoint of different participants and reads smoothly throughout. I was impressed that the book not only tells the story of the hostages but also the would be rescuers. Additionally the book gives the political context that the hostage crisis happened in not only in America but also in Iran. With Iran being a hot button issue in today's political discourse it is nice to get some of the backstory of Iran and the United States involvement in the country. I would highly recommend this book.
5,Incredible author,Mark Bowden writes as if he was a fly on the wall. He makes you respect and hate certain witness.
3,OK hat-- could be better,Hats are of decent quality.... but not great....Very Light-Weight Construction.For a few cents more - they could have made a much better hat.(I know my hats - I sell large custom orders - Direct from overseas... but my kids wanted these)for the Discounted Price I paid (and had to buy 3 in order to get free shipping)they were JUST OK....if they're NOT on SALE - you'd be crazy to pay $15-$20 for these....I paid I believe $10-$11 (which retail for a fitted cap is so-so)
3,Terribly edited from three episodes of the series,"This video took elements from The Living Legend Parts 1 and 2 and the episode Fire In Space. Missing from this video is a scene from part two where Sheba (Cain's daughter) is shot and brought aboard the Galactica, this is a key scene because her character and actress Anne Lockhart stayed on after this two-part episode to finish out the original series run. Also missing is the original scene where Starbuck and Apollo tell Adama about Cain going off into space again. Note: Adama was not wounded in the original run of the two part episode. It's a shame that Glen Larson and Universal don't take the fans keen eyes and memory into consideration. Worst line.""Those gulmonging Cylons"" said by Lloyd Bridges way too many times."
5,great,Iam very happy with product.Was just what i wanted.shipping was right on time.I would buy more like these if i could.Great price.
3,Helpful in basic research endeavors,"Having had ocassion to research and write several papers dealing with mythology, I have often turned to Stapleton's book to acquire at least a basic familiarity with a myth or legend. While his dictionary does not include many of the more obscure tales, the listed entries do provide in-depth, helpful information on the ""classic"" myths."
4,As good as Bjorn for less,"My wife and I both wear this. It fits comfortably and the gel stuff works! I wish it had lumbar support, came in other colors and was lighter, but excellent quality overall and a good value."
1,Not so smart rider,"I got this carrier and took my son to the park in it right away. After about ten minutes, my back was killing me. No matter how I adjusted the straps, he continued to lean forward and I had to hold him up with my hands to keep him from looking down at ground. Finally, I had to take him out and carry him back home. It was a waste of the shipping expense."
1,Disappointing durability,"This front-loader was highly anticipated by my 4 year old. He played with it probably about 12 times before the bucket on the front snapped off. He wasn't dropping it from the playset or crunching it with another truck, he was simply trying to use it as it is intended, to scoop up things (in this case, sand). Its a great looking construction vehicle but I have to give it just one star because if it breaks this easily its not worth the money and it disappointed both of us."
4,Sly fox loses again,"The perennial story of a sly fox trying to trick other, more innocent animals is given a new chapter here. In this story, the fox attempts to persuade mother duck that he is a duck as well, so that he can sneak up on her ducklings and have one for lunch. Mother duck asks the visitor to prove himself by quacking, waddling, eating bugs for lunch, and - finally - diving headfirst deep into the pond, whereupon the fox decides it's not worth all the trouble and heads for home. Children who don't know that foxes eat ducklings might find the story to be a bit over their heads. I think my daughter, who is 3, was too young to really enjoy it. This book would be perfect for a second grade classroom studying animal tales and Aesop's fables."
4,Do Like a Duck Does,"This book has been a perennial favorite with the children of our church. They love the wonderful illustrations, and trying to imitate the baby ducks. I was happy to find a replacement copy through Amazon."
2,very average&boring,Mary J.Blige is doing Mariah Carey type songs now.this is so average&Diane Warren composed this? it figures Mary J go back to feeling this isn't working.run of the mill Product.
4,give me you,i think that it was a very sweet song and it gave a lot of meanning to the words love and care.
2,Go Diego Go Playhut,"This product looks just like it does on its package. It came with two plasticsupport bars that are inserted just above both openings. It is lightweight and easy to handle. My 4-year old son loved it and even wanted to sleep in the day we got it. However, he was really frustrated when it would tip over or fall on him. The bottom part of the tent is lined with wire, easily bent, and doesn't provide for a sturdy structure. I used some tape to secure it to the floor but it didn't stay put. It could use some reinforcement to stand in place."
3,It would be a four star rating if it were still in the condition the late R.P. Oliver left it in...,"Profiles in Populism is a very good book aboutPatriotic Americans who the late Revilo P.Oliver thought worthy of noting. But then thecorrupt and evil Willis Carto got ahold of itand perverted it toward the far right and awayfrom the politcal middle which is what Populismmeans ('not of the right or left')! Carto's mostobvious lunacy is insisting on inserting the liethat the late, great Rev. Charles B. Coughlinonce did a eulogy at the gravesdie of a masonicklansman! Anybody with half a brain knows thatCoughlin hated the masonic klan and went afterthem for attacking Catholics, among others inhis Social Justice magazine (1932-41). Cartoinserted other things that Oliver would havenever written. To see more on Carto's (alledged)writing career go the Institute for HistoricalReview's site, Carto page. Thanks and best regards!"
3,Engaging Sugar Flowers Sprays for Cakes,"If you are seeking to create elegant and decadent gum paste flower sprays for a show-stopping celebration cake, this is your book! Decorative Touches by Tombi Peck is a creative and imaginative approach to gum paste flower sprays for cakes. This book encompasses weddings, christenings, Mother's Day, and a harvest cake.What I appreciated most about this book is the attention to detail in the pictures. Showing how to wire a floral spray was a great way to add value to this book, and a great example of the attention to detail showed by the author. Peck also showcased her originality in the diversity of the projects presented from bonsai trees to a water lily pram. I found the book to be well-written, original, detailed, but regionalized."
1,PIRATES LOCAL 451 ON STRIKE,"All right. so maybe the pirates in this catastrophe weren't unionized, but that's the impression I got from Silver Hawk and his pirate brotherhood (updated for 2001, of course). I'm not sure this book is bad so much as it is only ridiculous. Having read Sweet Savage Eden, I was curious about its sequel, and that curiosity did not pay off for me. A Pirate's Pleasure is a pale shimmer of its predecessor, with characters and dialogue so disparate from the first that I had to wonder if indeed the same author penned both books. Any book in which the heart of a knight lies within the (perfect, of course) physique of a pirate immediately gets slated as ""humor"" in my mind. On the bright side, at least some of the cover art isn't your typical Barbie doll stuff--the portrait of Skye Kinsdale on the spine and the back cover looks much like Sigourney Weaver after battling the aliens. Pretend you don't see this one."
3,"Action packed romance on the high seas, but cliche heroine was too much","This book is the classic example of an 80's romance novel with plenty of over-the-top action and cheesy romance dialog. I can see why there are big fans of this book as the story is not meant to be taken seriously. It was a fun rompt story that never let up from the action. My only big complaint was the heroine, as she got on my nerves. She fought, complained and put herself in danger non-stop! She pulls so many stupid decisions, all in the name of keeping the story action packed, but it was too much. This story would have been much better if only the heroine showed a bit of common sence. How the great Pirate hero falls for her was a mystery to me."
5,great romance,"i really liked this book, the writting was original and easy to imagine the sceens. Great read and great author."
1,I Threw This Book Away,This book was so bad I threw it away. (I have never thrown a book away but I did throw this one away.) This was one of the worst books I have every read. The review on the back of this book never even mentions her husband that she didn't know she even married because her father went behind her back to force the issue. It talks about the romance with her husband's cousin and him being a pirate. Then for a woman to be bedded by two men unwilling is not romance. Then to discover your pregnant and you don't know who the father is not romance. That's terrible! Save the trees do not print any more. If I could give this book a negative I would. One star is just to high for this book. Never will I read another one of her books. Your time is more valuable then to waste it reading this book.
4,Very amusing both story and filming,"This recording dates back to 1981, so don't expect outstanding modern special effects. Despite of the slightly old style of the filming the story is very amusing and is loyal to the original book from Douglas Adams. This DVD is worth buying both for its extremely funny and famous story as well as historic aspect showing the studio work of that era. Organization of this disc is good and the quality of filming and actor work is excellent. Guaranteed BBC quality."
1,A piece of Junk from Motorola,"I used 5320, 5420 2 miles range walkie talkie before, I have to say they are much better than this 5 mile range 5820. 5820 does not even go beyond one mile and voice are twisted. very dissapointed at this unit, do yourself a favor, if you need 5 miles range buy a 5720"
1,POOR RANGE-POOR SOUND QUALITY,I am sorry to say that the range on these even in the 5 mile range is no where near expected. I have not been able to transmit or receive further than 1 mile.
2,Not good enough for Motorola,"I have been using radios for severals years for traveling and other general purposes. These radios are good in terms of range and features BUT the speakers are poor and have to repeat messages often because of poor sound quality and poor volume. In a mall or anyplace with background noise, forget about hearing your call. Count on the flimsy plastic swivel clip breaking and having to purchase decent belt clips. Have been through this twice. Earlier Motorola FRS radios were great but it's been downhill. (no difference between FRS and GMRS really) Try the Cobras w/ compass and other stuff - they are slightly larger but the sound quality is great."
1,Poor quality all around,"Several problems:Both of the battery covers cracked soon after I got them. Design flaw in the coverSecond, they don't work farther than 20-30 feet. Using a friends to debug, one of them doesn't transmit well.they're old enough now Motorola no longer offers support on them, repair or replace."
5,Awesome and EXTREMELY sturdy,I purchased the T5710 model. I take these radios camping with me to stay in touch with the family. I stopped along the highway to check something and left the radio on top of the car. As I was driving off the radio fell off the top of the car and into the path of an oncoming 18 wheeler. The truck ran over the radio. The radio still worked perfectly. The range could be a little longer but i am very satisfied with my radios!!
4,simple and sweet,"This is a lovely picture book for children. The simple drawings help illustrate the characters, Eric and Matilda. When Eric sees Matilda it's love at first sight. Eric wants Matilda to know he loves her, but try as he may she doesn't notice him. Finally Eric is advised by a wise owl to simply tell Matilda how he feels. When Eric tells Matilda he loves her he is pleasantly surprised to hear she loves him too and they both fly south together."
5,Just The Pan I Needed,"I'm starting to bake gluten-free breads and I've been having trouble getting them to bake properly in the center. When I put my quick bread batter into the 7.5 x 3.5 pan, it baked all the way through with just the right texture. I couldn't get all of the batter to fit in this size, but I put the rest into liners in a cupcake tin and that worked well for the extra. Well worth the experiment. I'm really happy with this pan. For anyone who's having trouble getting their breads to release (I think someone else has covered this), make sure you grease the pan well, put down a piece of parchment paper on the bottom, grease that, then pour in your batter. I didn't have any trouble getting my bread out."
3,It's okay,It's okay. I find breads still stick even if I oil it. It's hard to get the crevices clean and it seems like it's rusting already.
1,Turned black,This pan turned black after I hand washed it. I can't get it off I would not recommend it for purchase.
5,Awesome Pan,"This is a perfect pan for small loaves, especially for those of you making breads from the Almond Flour Cookbook - nothing ever sticks and it washes up quickly."
3,Baking pan,"Have not used this item as yet; so I am unable to comment at this time. I will be happy to do so when I have tried it out. The handling of the order was not up to the usual standard. It was not included in the original shipment., even though it was paid for. It was shipped later after a complaint was voiced.However, the complaint was handled in a prompt and efficient manor."
3,Probably worth it if you speak (and read) fluent Spanish,"""Cola"" translates as ""Glue"". This is one of a series of Spanish translations, with copious amounts of notes, so well worth buying if you know the language, although the price may be enough to put all but the most ardent of Welsh's fanbase off."
3,A revelation,"This is the first CD of of such genre I have come acros and the combination of old music and modern rythms has really blown me away. Although it may be overpretentios and not lively in places, songs such Rtzeh are not to be underestimated. Rtzeh really carries in itself the depth of the Jewish tradition and the intensity of the guitar and electronica arrangements - in the best traditions of the ""Last Temptation of Christ"" music. Generally a highly advisable CD - a wonderful spiritual experience."
1,"TERRIBLE, IT MADE ME WANT TO END MY LIFE.","THESE GUYS CAN SING. UNFORTUNATELY THEY CANNOT WRITE SONGS THAT ARE LESS DERIVATIVE THAN WALTER CLEVENGER. IF JELLYFISH RECORDED JOHNNY MATHIS SONGS AND SPED UP THEIR VOICES TO SOUND LIKE ALVIN, SIMON AND THEODORE THE RESULT WOULD BE WONDERFUL LIFE - A SCHLOCKY, SYRUPY, PREDICATBLE, AND CLOYING POP EFFORT THAT MAKES YOU REALIZE THAT ROCK AND ROLL IS DEAD, AND THE TORIES LIKELY KILLED IT."
2,not quite what I expected,Somewhat confusing and not nearly as useful as other headlamps I have used. The brighter lights are only usable when attached to the external battery pack making it quite heavy. Perhaps you get what you pay for.
2,Rambling on and on,"I thought this book was gonna be good because of who wrote it, but it just goes on and on and on with no point and not a whole lot of plot."
1,Outstandingly Flawed!!,"Merlyn would have hated this book and the author who wrote it. Amazingly shallow with numerous, rediculous and gratutious sex narratives. The ""thrashing"" episode was a waste of ink and could easily have been written by any hormonal 17 year old high school male."
1,"THANK YOU, JESUS! I ALMOST BOUGHT THIS PIECE-O-CRAP.","The 1st chapter weirded me out; it was truly a DEFCON 5 WTF! experience. Chapter 2 kinda shuffled about like a senile geezer, at the home, with happy feet bout 3 o'clock in the morning.If Hollywood dont wanna make a movie of a book, how good can it be?"
1,One of the worst books I've ever read!,"By far, one of the worst books I've ever managed to get through . It seems to me that it was only re-released to capitalize on the author's death."
4,Not bad...,"Well, I just finished this one. Not too bad, although I wouldn't agree with most of the comments posted here. Better than the Godfather? Don't fool yourself. I found that it was more about Merlyn (the main character) than Vegas itself, and I don't remember him being that 'attached' to the city. However, Fools Die is a good read. I would suggest it to any Puzo fans, just don't expect it to be a classic."
3,"Decent book, Gripping it is not.","I've never read a Puzo novel but found this book to be very average. There was really no set plot as far as I understood but maybe that's the way he wanted it. I found myself getting bored with all the ranting going on, especially from the ""Osano"" character. The only thing I REALLY liked about it were the conversations between Cully and Groneburg (was that his name?)and the little casino secret tidbits they talked about. A few of the things about the characters weren't very belivable and irritated me. For example, how Merlyn grew to not care about the film he was semi-working on and his percentage on it. For a man struggling for any type of income why would he do this? Maybe I'm just overanalyzing the whole thing but in my opinion it just wasn't the ""GRIPPING, POWERFUL"" novel that half of you reviewers are claiming it to be. But for an affordable p-back, you really can't go TOO wrong."
2,Ponderous Puzo,"Sorry. I was very disappointed in this book. Frankly, at times it was a struggle to read. The story was good, the characters believeable, but something was lacking. I'm still not sure if I would term Merlyn as deep or shallow. Here's a man who loves his wife yet holds a lifelong, cross country affair wth a bisexual actress. Please! The man was a series of contrasts. Maybe that is what Puzo was trying to bring out but he lost it on me. What I did, however, particularly enjoy, was how Puzo brought the ""beginning"" of the book to the climax. That was genius. But if you want to read a good Puzo book, pick up ""The Last Don."""
2,Fair to midland,"Overall, a disappointing read. Embarrassingly bad sex scenes. Shallow characters. Dumb story."
3,Print is small.,"Ordered as Christmas gift and received in time as guaranteed, however, print is extremely small. Possibly going to return this item."
3,Good Read defiently entertaning,This book was a good read. It was entertaing. However I was not completly impresed as I ussaly am by Puzzos work. It was realistic and down to earth entering fun. I definetly recomend it if you have nothing else to read. There are also intresting little parts about how casinos are run and so on.
4,Awesome Puzo!,"Puzo shows the same temptations(lust,seduction,money,power,etc.) work outside his mafia novels."
3,Best thing about this book is the title.,"Heres a great story about gamblers in Vegas. Too bad only a quarter of the book has to do with this storyline. He mixes the Vegas storyline with a monotonous story of a writer and his sex life, using this story as a sounding board for his opinions on famous literature and male-female relationships. Puzo has some insightful opinions about these things, but he beats the subjects to death. Every woman in the book other than two married women are hopeless sluts. Worse then sluts, they are basically whores. I dont think Puzo even proof-read his own book, because there are several small conflicting story points. No climactic ending, he builds up tension but doesnt deliver. There isnt even any fool that dies. Read it for the interesting Vegas insights, speed-read through the rest."
3,Good book but lacking story,"Not up to Mario Puzo standards, the story does not develop as quickly as other novels, a good story but constantly wondering when we will get into the ""meat"" of the novel."
3,I actually saw the show,I actually am one of the few people who actually saw the show. I was 17 at the time (some 50 years ago) and it still sticks in my mind as being the worst show I ever saw.I thought I'd buy the record and give it to my sister as a joke ( she and I saw the show with our parents)-I must admit I dont recall the music- but the storyline was just dreadful.
1,Horrible book for beginning XML,"Horrible book out there for learning XML. Lack of imagination on the part of the authors leads to same, mind-numbing, utterly useless example being used throughout the book.Can use the book for a quick glance at the XML syntax though, but don't expect to learn anything from the book.No wonder the book sells for less than $2, and is worth only that much."
3,Revisiting Youth,I started reading the hardy boys to revisit my youth.I thouroghly enjoyed these novels when i was younger.It still has the magic.But relatively simple as expected.I still consider it entertaining.
5,Great read,As with all the Hard Boys books this was another good one. I always enjoy sitting down and absorbing a good book. I like the way it takes me away which makes the read that much more to enjoy.
5,Incredible!!,"... This book is excellent; definately one of the top three of the series. The action starts on page 1 and doesn't let up until the book is finished. Hunting For Hidden Gold has perhaps the best mystery out of all of the books in the series and is written quite well unlike most of the books put out after the early 1950s. The book is very exciting, as quite often Frank and Joe are chasing, or being chased by, the criminals. Definately one of the best, no Hardy Boys fan should miss this one."
4,I read it in two nights!,"When I first saw this book, I thought that it was just another male-basher. Further inspection proved that it was written by men and that it was directed toward women. The focus was to help women recognize patterns in male behavior and make intelligent choices. The first thing that the authors say is that NOT ALL men are (expletive deleted). That impressed me. The author's credentials also impressed me. They have worked with women, men and couples for some years. I wish I had had this book ten years ago. But it's good to have it now that I find myself single. The authors have sorted men into different categories based on their behavior. They realize how hard women work to maintain relationships and give them strategies for having a positive impact on their own life and chosen mates. I don't give anything 5 stars, I won't give this one 5 stars because I think JERKS would have been just as good an expletive as the one they used but so be it."
1,This book preys on weak women..,"My roommate from a few years ago had this book on her shelf and let me take a look. After skimming through it, it became obvious why she had trouble finding guys and keeping them. Books like these make relationship problems worse by simply bashing men and telling troubled women it's not their fault.I don't want to knock all women who buy this book, especially if it's just for fun, but I feel sorry for the women out there who feel compelled to buy books like this one to help them find someone. Your lovelife isn't going to improve but the bank balances of the authors certainly will. There must be something more effective you can spend your money on."
1,Waste of time,"Just another male hating book, the lib media will eat this up as they do all anti male books etc.What a shame."
4,Discernment,This is not a casual read. For the spiritually mature with discernment. Good study for what this spirit has the ability to disrupt and cause. Be carefull what you blame things on.
5,Awesome insight,"This book is well written with the intent of bringing this complicated subject matter to the body of Christ, it was a real blessing, plus it allowed me to see how this spirit may have worked through me thus bringing me closer to my walk with God"
1,Unmasking the Jezabel Spirit,"A brilliant concept and mastery of maninpulation! This book just creates an excuse for churches to hurt and destroy any woman who disagrees or disrupts the agenda.If a pastor is attracted to a woman who is not his wife could it be a personal weekness? Noooooooo, it must be the Jezabel Spirit! Why should a pastor be responsible for his thoughts?Is someone asking too many questions about extra-Biblical practices? Don't bother answering, just pitch her in the street. Show no mercy. The Jezabel Spirit must be destroyed!I grieve to think of the number of women who have been systematicaly destroyed in the name of this godless destructive teaching."
1,Fraud?,"After reading this book I have given much thought to how error has slipped into the Church. The pot calls the kettle black. The tares call the wheat heretics. Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you, for so did their fathers to the false prophets. This book is borderline antichrist. It appears to have been written by the same spirit that it pretends to expose. For a better look at this subject, read, ""This Church is not Appearing Glorious and it doesn't seem to be Purpose Driven"". Leave this one on the shelf."
3,Hoped for Better,"I was intrigued by the subject. And having personally heard the author speak in public, I expected an effective argument. But I was left unconvinced by the author's assertions. Using a narrated series of testimonies, the author makes broad assumptions based on subjective experience. He connects these stories to ""that woman Jezebel"" from the New Testament book of Revelations, chapter 2. He submits the same false prophetic ""spirit"" continues to influence power hungry people (mostly women) today in many churches. He may or may not be correct, but how can we know? Those who know him well may take his word for it. But what are the rest of us to do?"
4,be careful as you read,"I think that before anyone picks this book up they need to pray for a sound mind and also put on the whole armour of God because even with the explainations, which the author did a wonderful job, you must know in your heart who you are, what your mission is, and Gods voice! It helped me so much to reconize this spirit. The Ahab spirit knocked on my door today as the Jezebel spirit sit watching in the car and I knew right off who they were by the words they used. I know that no weapons formed against me shall prosper and that I am more than a conquerer through Christ Jesus who strengthens me. I have been in the ministry three years. Thank you for the book, it is truly an eye opener, and it forces you to read for yourself, the Word of God! The whole story about this couple."
1,No way.,"This movie has always served as an example of movies I really didn't like. Saw it at a drive-in, back in the day. Midway through it, I was fidgeting, squirming, looking at my watch. I have no interest in Rachel's life problems or internal conflicts. I don't know why anyone would care to know about them."
4,A delightful read,"Mynatt's debut YA novel is a delightful read. Heather is a young woman with a passion--and that's dancing. I loved the way that theme kept coming back to the reader. It led me to feel like her passion was mine. As a former longtime resident of El Paso, I also enjoyed the setting. Mynatt made me feel like I was back home. Although I suspected who the bad guy was, Mynatt kept me unsure until the end. This work is truly a story about dreams and danger, and how our passions can take us to the edge of both. I write strong women, and delighted in reading a YA book about a strong young woman. An inspiration to young women looking for their own path, and finding the courage to follow it.A War of Her Own - A World War II Novel"
2,"Sad, Sad, Sad,","I truly do not like this book. I was very dissapointed when I read it. I cannot see why anyone would like it. It's plot was not very good. Very hard to believe. Although, it have a few interesting parts in it. I think that teenagers might like this book, but I don't. The end might have been better if the author had put more detail into it. Even though I didn't like it too much, I must say it kept my attention"
1,Stupid Book!,I hate this book with a passion! Why did this person write it? It has a horrid plot. I wish it was never written!
4,Fire,"This CD is fire. I bought the first one years ago in Santa Fe on the main square in a little music shop. Later when I looked better at the cover photo of this CD I realized the sales person was Edgar Cruz himself! On this CD they play popular tunes of which some I can even play myself on my guitar. But they play it at a speed and the two guitar sound created by Ruben Romero dancing around the melody is dazzling. Fire!All tracks are good and in a fine order. We play this CD quite often, both at home and in my car. Last Spring 2010 I bought this CD through Amazon.com again as a gift for someone."
2,Boring,This was a slow moving and boring book. It was told by the perp sharing all of his feelings about the how and why. Not a good story.
3,The Book of Evidence,"I read this as a book group selection. It provided many psychological and social subjects to discuss. What the characters lack in charm they make up in complexity.Banville's writing is seamless and beautiful. With little dialogue it is largely a stream-of-conciousness narative.I caution the reader to treat it as serious literature and read carefully. The Book of Evidence sounds like ""genre"" fiction but it isn't. If you try to give it a quick read, you will miss the point.This is not a murder mystery."
4,"Engrossing, Sad, Tragic ... You Will Like Having Read This Tale","A genuinely good and thought-provoking read; well, it's Banville telling you a story, you wouldn't expect anything less. Freddie, the main character, a cad, a bounder, a slug. A parasite who so bored with himself has exhausted his privileged life by feeding off a circle of friends and family who so cared for him, they let him make their lives sad and tragic as a result of him living his life. Worse yet, he's an intelligent and perhaps talented individual, who with some semblance of a work ethic could have easily made those lives around him better for knowing him. Banville's writing is hard to put down once started because it flows seamlessly and causes one to lose himself; engrossing it is. Why four stars and not five ... I don't know, it just stuck me that way. But, with a little nudging I could be pushed into a five-star rating. It's more me being a curmudgeon than Banville's tale not being a five-star read."
5,Excellent Reference,I have used the Voice of the Customer and Concept Engineering processes for the past 7 years at both large and small companies and have continued to relly on this book. The process can be well adapted based on the scope of the project. The book is very cleary laid out and is an excellent reference. It is packed full of helpful tips and information. I recommend it to anyone wanting to proactively listen to their customers.
4,A true bible for Costume makers.,"This book is so very useful for my business. We work in the amateur theatre industry, mainly dealing with period costume. Often we are called on to create some garment from a particular period and we usually run straight to this book to get our ideas. I especially like the fact that it shows costumes from SO MANY periods in history. Anything else wirtten by this author, I would buy without hesitation."
4,Good book,"I wasn't sure exactly what to expect form this book (Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915), but it will be perfect for what I will be doing. I knew the book itself was used and there was still bits of paper and patterns in between the pages from the previous owner showing that the book had been used well. But all in all the book is still in pretty good shape. Thank you. I would order form this merchant again."
4,"Good basic choice, nothing fancy","If you are making basic costumes, without either the time or need for special detailing, this is probably a good choice (I see it as a useful source for high school, college, or amateur theater productions). It doesn't require a lot of experience in pattern drafting, but you'll do better if you have done some drafting--or at least some pattern alterations. If you're looking for detail and authenticity, go to Janet Arnold or Norah Waugh."
4,Excellent Resource,"This book is an excellent resource for basic period costumes. It is relatively easy to copy the patterns onto a grided template, as long as you can use graft paper. If you are looking for historically acurate information, you will want to use other resources in conjuction. Also, if you are a begining sewer, this will not give you the how-to directions, but as far as pattern books go, this is a good one!"
5,"Very informative, detailed pictures and labels","The drawings in this book are amazing. I think this book is probably for a very experienced dressmaker because there are no individual instructions for each piece and a lot of fitting knowledge is required. Personally, my favorite part is looking at the exquisite drawings since I am not experienced at all. I would reccomend this book to anyone with an interest in costuming or costumes."
3,Decent amateur theater/halloween costume book,"This book covers a very wide range of time periods, and so only offers one male and one female garment from each era. It's good for getting a feel for the silhouette of the period and some insight into pattern shapes--I haven't used the patterns inside because they have no scale or instructions. Some accessories are also shown. This is not a good book for reenactors or people looking for depth, but if you're looking for simple costume ideas, it's a good start."
5,This is a great book,This is part of my core books for designing costumes and clothing. It is a great book for pro's and sewers with a lot of experience. Beginners should know that you have to graft the patterns to scale and that the patterns in this book are not pre-grafted. If you are not comfortable grafting look for a different book.It is a great reference book for clothing and time periods.
2,"Too tiny, slides right under door, can't use them","Perhaps it's my fault for buying the wrong size, but it's just a bathroom door (???) Well, at least my cats now have a new toy :-)"
3,Overpriced (for Kindle),"A lovely tale, and the illustrations have translated adequately to the kindle screen. However it was $7.99 for what is just a short tale, and my 8year old devoured it in 15 minutes. Amazon have misprinted this. $7.99 is ok for a beautiful printed book but for the text in an e-reader this shoud be more like 99c."
2,It's been done better before.,"It's not just that there's nothing new under the sun -- there's nothing new here. I finished reading this yesterday, and today I can't remember one affirmative, original concept from the book. On the other hand, I read Stephen Levine's ""A Year to Live"" six months ago, and the concepts and images from that book are still crystal-clear in my mind. I'd skip Mira Kirshenbaum and go straight to the heart and soul -- Stephen Levine."
5,From the Publisher,"""Artist Whitfield Lovell uses his personal archive of late nineteenth and early twentieth century studio photographs of African Americans as the basis for his charcoal drawings on wood. Paying close attention to the grain and texture of the wood as well as to any remnants of color from paint or wallpaper, the artist adds found objects, creating a three-dimensional work that brings strangers from the past directly into the viewer's world.""Twenty assorted full-color 4-3/4 x 6-3/4"" blank notecards (5 each of 4 designs) with envelopes in a decorative box.

2,"some interesting stuff, but...","there's some interesting stuff in here, particularly in the area of computer forensics. but the book jumps all over the place. it starts with an good story of a real forensic raid (i beleive just the names were changed to protect the innocent), but abruptly switches to entirely unrelated situations. it eventually drops the storyline altogether, leaving you wondering how it ended and what the aftermath was."
1,neither fish nor fowl,"I, for one, don't want to read about fictional investigations. But that is not the only issue here. First, the subject is supposed to be investigating corporate fraud. As another reviewer noted, however, the only subject covered is computer techniques. The actual tracking of the fraud never really appears in any detail. I was expecting a tale of actual processes and insights into actual crimes; however, the book stops short at the recovery of information from computers. The interesting part would be how one piece of info leads to another and suggests other places to look. But nothing is looked at that closely, so the excitement is lost. I also agree with the other reviewer that the relevance of the dog-mauling case is tangential at best. Even in chapters with strong subject matter, such as the investigation of the swiss handling of jewish acounts, the prose is lifeless and conclusory; it does not follow the trail of the adventure."
3,"Product okay, an online recommendation for using it was unreliable","I won't pan the product if it is used for something that works. Using it with a heat padto eliminate problems or to cure ailments actually caused health problems! This wasdue to listening to online recommendations instead of having valid information. Iam sure the product is fine, it just depends on how it is used!"
5,Certainly one of the best,"I'm sure most would agree that Strung Out is one of the greatest bands in existence. Yet they remain relatively under-appreciated I think. This is thier second best album, but still one of my all-time favorites. The guitar sound is tight, crunching and fast...impeccable, really and there is not one bad song. An amazing follow-up to STWB. The closing track is the highlite for me. This is one of the best for sure"
4,Harder than the previous two albums,Strung out has done it again. The boys from Simi Valley California stay true to their artistic integrity and put together another great punk rock album in true strung out fashion. This album is a little harder than suburban... but it great none the less. Unfortunalty the album does not come with a lyric sheet but the music is what really matters. Strung out continues to put out consistent punk rock and the latest is no exception.
2,Don't waste your time!,If liked their first couple of albums you might not like this one. I could'nt believe this was the same band. Aside from a few songs the whole thing sucks!
2,deceptive label,"Not 100% aloe. 100% gel rather. ...What exactly did we think it was, 80% gel and 20% cupcakes? This label was designed, like other aloe formulas that I've seen, to make the customer think it was pure aloe. It isn't. You're better off not buying it."
1,not recommended,"Cheap price, cheap quality.Not good, not recommended.Better to buy other product.Never buy this again.If there were no returning fee, I would return."
4,affordable and effective for post-waxing,"Affordable and effective and does not cause my skin to break out - I use it after waxing and it's cheaper than the usual post-axing products sold, and as effective"
4,Does the job,I love this product a lot. It is 100% natural and heals the minor wounds and rashes greatly. Great alternative to lotions.
3,"pedantic and dry, in the stuffy, classical British style","I was turned on to this book decades ago by one of my professors. The book bursts with useful material, but the organization is poor, the explanations almost nil, and the problems remote. (Indeed, most of the ""drill"" problems that the book provides are from British university honors' examinations in mathematics on which applicants are expected to score 15%.) If you are looking for a strong, harmonious collection of advanced techniques in advanced analysis, harmonic functions, and many aspects of operational calculus, you would do better to read ""Applied Analysis"" by the immortal Cornelius Lanczos."
1,Not what I expected-my team needed more info!,"Unfortunately, this toolkit was not what I was looking for. Our team needed more in-depth information and statistics."
5,Kenneth Cole Slip On,I actually bought this item for my younger brother while preparing for my wedding day. It was difficult to get the colour I wanted in his size so I placed a rush order through amazon when I finally found this. The shoe fit him perfectly and it also arrived just in time for my wedding.
4,NO SOPHOMORE JINX,A very good second album from one of the best voices and music writers in rock n roll. A real fast tempo in the beginning sets the pace for another Lenny Wolf creation worth a listen to. Also in the band STONE FURY this guy is a real talent. If you like KINGDOM COME [ and I think you will ] try to find the album BURNS LIKE A STAR by STONE FURY. It didn`t sell many copies but it really rocks. P.S. I sent to Russia for a copy.
3,A good album,"This second album from Kingdom Come, In Your Face, was released in 1989. The material is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction. Overall, I find the songwriting to be tight, the musicianship to be solid, and the sound quality to be worthy. Of the ten tracks, there are no power ballads. Some of the cuts include nice keyboard work. Lenny Wolf does a gratifying and industrious job with the vocals. The guitar playing is also pleasing throughout. Although I like every one of the songs, my favorites are ""Do You Like It,"" ""Who Do You Love,"" ""The Wind,"" and ""Gotta Go (Can't Wage a War)."" ""Do You Like It""--the opening composition--is a catchy, energetic, and ambitious one that sports a memorable, engaging guitar riff. ""Who Do You Love"" displays a charming section of stately guitar work and smooth keyboard playing. ""The Wind"" exhibits appealing rhythm guitar work, while ""Gotta Go (Can't Wage a War)"" has a pleasant chorus. In Your Face is an enjoyable album from Kingdom Come."
5,AWESOME!,"I remember when this album came out. I had to buy another one, because I wore the poor cassete to death!Finding someone that had this on cd was HUGE to me (retro flashing back and all, lol) and the cd arrived in FLAWLESS condition, and was well packaged!I not only recommend this seller, but i HIGHLY recommend this album if you EVER liked Rock n Roll, and Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, etc. REAL good band. This album, and the one that came before it (the Self-Titled release) were the ONLY 2 good albums they ever produced. The ones that followed had different line-ups, and too much ego-drama amongst the band mates to make any other album decent."
3,zepplin imposter? big deal,i think this cd is pretty good.lenny wolf has an amazing voice.they were accused of being zepplin imposters but i don't think that's such a bad thing.after all zepplin was very popular and other artists use material from other artists all the time. overall if you like zepplin give this one a listen
3,Good Rock album,"If you like pure rock and if you like Led Zep, you'll like this cd for sure. Some pretty good rock songs on this release. I prefer the first album but his one is not bad at all."
3,This Album's Allright.,"I've had the cassette to In Your Face for several years. I don't listen to it much now, but I did quite a bit when I first bought it. ""Do You Like It"" is a pretty cool tune. The rest of them are good, but quite average. I could care less if they sounded like Led Zeppelin or not since I was never a fan of Led Zeppelin. This album's allright."
3,Mediocre - A huge letdown from the brilliant first album,"I've had a soft spot for Kingdom Come, ever since listening to Detroit radio while getting ready for high school at 6 am. One day a dj came on saying ""We've found a band that sounds EXACTLY like Led Zeppelin!"" Then they played Get It On. I nearly ... my frickin pants.This album, while containing perhaps 2 songs that are somewhat on par with their legendary first album, is a enormous letdown. Perhaps Lenny was tired, or the cocaine was taking it's toll, I don't know. But the effort here feels rushed and unpolished. This album would've benefited from another month in production and the elimination of the GODAWFUL 'Gotta Go' song."
2,It's okey,"Many claim that Kingdom Come sounds like Led Zeppelin, that's not really true. The case is that Kingdom Come's music is over all inspired by Zeppelin's song ""Kashmir"". Kingdom Come is an average heavy metal band and ""In your face"" is a decent album in this genre. The best tracks are ""Who do you love"" and ""Stargazer"" (not the Rainbow song), the rest is rather mediocre. And by the way, their first album is better..."
1,It would have been Zero stars,"This thing stopped working after 3 months. I called and they offered nothing in the way of customer support. There was nowhere to take to get it fixed. IT wouldn't have been worth the money. It was fine WHILE IT WORKED!! but that wasn't for very long. I guess it's true what they say, you get what you pay for."
3,At High Volumes Its Limitations Become Clear,"This is an affordable powered sub with specifications on paper that seem acceptable. For awhile I had been using this sub with the cross over set at 50hz and the volume dial set at about 7.5 out of 10. This seemed to be working alright until while I was watching a few DVD's and listening to various CD's I noticed that there was a rattling noise coming from the port. Other than turning the volume down I could find no solution to the port problem. At high volumes the sub itself seems to have problems handling the power from the amp. Even with the crossover set at 50hz(The lowest available) you can't even attempt to push the sub to 9 or 10 on the volume dial. The semi-solution I came up with to overcome the limitations was to turn the crossover to 150hz and turn down the volume to 6. It seems to sound alright now. So, At higher volumes this sub has some definite limitations."
1,I WILL NEVER BUY A _KLH_ SPEAKER AS LONG AS I LIVE!!!!!!,I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE 4 MONTHS AGO AFTER A MONTH IT FRIED! SOO I EXCHANED IT FOR ANOTHER ONE AND AFTER A MONTH THAT ONE FRIED ________I WILL NEVER BUY A KLH SPEAKER FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE!!!!!!!!!!_________________
1,After 1 1/2 years it fried itself - Fire Hazard?,"I bought this subwoofer about a year and a half ago. For that time it worked great until just recently. The sound was clear with a bunch of power. The other night I noticed that the area near it smelled ""hot."" I immediately unplugged the unit and noticed a black liquid/goo dripping out from under the amplifier. It concerned me that if I hadn't noticed the problem when I did, it could have started a fire. I have written to KHL to see if this was just a defect in my unit or a product defect. I will post their response here. Until I found out this could be a serious problem that needs to be looked into."
2,Good while it lasted,"Just like so many other people have reported about KLH subwoofers, mine just burned up. 6 days after the warranty expired - figures. My whole house now smells likes burnt hair. I never pushed this speaker; it just died from a congenital defect. Bad amp design = early death. The repair cost is more than the unit's worth so this one goes to the landfill."
2,"6 Months of good sound, then ...","I bought this in April after getting a pair of KLH ""twisty"" speakers. It ran fine, sounded great and then blew the fuse.I replaced it and it ran fine for a couple of hours, then blew again. Replaced the fuse after checking cable, settings etc.It makes a loud humming noise even without anything hooked up to it, and the heat sink on the amp section gets VERY hot. Won't buy another KLH powered sub again."
5,KLH ASW10-120 powered subwoofer,"I bought this sub as fill in, until I can afford my dream. It works quite well, but a recommendation to all new users: keep the phase on norm and keep the crossover under 70 hertz. It can play loudly and cleanly when you do this. It works well with DVD Dolby and is very good with music. It can send very powerful vibrations through the floor (good 30 hertz response). Alway consider the vibrations when you place it. I could compare this to many $300-600 subs, but that's not fair. I will keep this one in use, even after I buy that dream unit."
1,Serious design defect.,I have one of these. It only hums but won't produce sound. The problem lies with a resistor that is undersized (cheaper) which blows and blows the power supply capacitors which are not exactly robust either. I would hate to think that KLH used substandard components to save a buck max at the expense of having most of these fail. It is all the more damming if you note that most of them make it through the warranty....barely. Best to pick a different brand. I would not have rated it one star if it was possible to rate it none.
1,"If you want an ASW10-120 , just look in my garbage can!!","I bought a ASW10-120 a couple years ago & never abused it ever.It worked fine for a couple years & I was a happy customer.The other night, something inside failed, and the sub-woofer started cranking out a 60 cycle hum at full volume.This thing was rattling the windows & freaking out the pets loud.Thank God I was home, or the neighbors would probably have needed to kick in my door to unplug it.I was going to locate a schematic online & fix it, but after a little research, there are too many reports of these units burning up or melting down. It appears that anyone who uses one of these is putting their families safety at risk. Look online, there are several horror stories.Mine is going in the dumpster right now."
2,"Great Sound, Won't Last","I bought this SW about a year ago, AWESOME bass! I was very impressed with its sound quality. I compared it to much more expensive subs and found that the ASW10-120 outperformed them all, BUT...about 8 months later, it fried. It was on a 100w receiver that barely got turned up beyond 1/4 volume, but yes, occasionally it got cranked. So I took it to and electronics guru friend of mine who looked it over and and stated that the amp was built with inferior circuits, and that to rebuild it with quality circuits would be worth more than the ASW10-120 if it were brand new. My advise: Do not buy it. Just google ASW10-120 problems. If you think you will not be cranking your sound up very loud then you don't need a sub, but if going to crank it up buy something that can handle the power. Like I said this 120w sub was on a 100w receiver. It didn't last."
2,keep away,"...This makes a terrible humming noise. I tested the driver and it's not it. I think the amp adds distortion to the signal. KLH needs to stick to speakers, not amps! Avoid this!"
1,Not worth the money,"This product was a Christmas gift for my son. He asked for a space station and it looked like it came highly recommended. For the money I paid for it, it was horribly put together. The peices don't stay attatched and it is cheaply made. I will never put that much money into a toy made of cheap plastic again. This was the one thing he asked for for Christmas and I am deeply disappointed at the horrible quality of it."
1,Poor construction,"I bought this as a gift for my 4 yr old nephew. He was thrilled when he opened the box, but when I started putting it together I noticed how poorly it was made. The doors on the rocket don't close, the peoples arms don't move, the rocket is very hard to put onto the arm like it's shown on the box. My nephew was having fun playing with it but I was upset at how much I paid for it since it wasn't working properly."
2,"kids love it, but very cheaply made","My boys received this from their grandparents. My boys are 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 years old. they LOVED this toy and even chose this over a TV show the first few mornings we had it. That said, the toy is so cheaply made (in fact, it came broken) and after the first few times playing with it, it is so broken and now dangerous because of the sharp plastic from the breaks. Very dissapointing because it's a fantastic idea, just really poorly made."
1,Poorly made toy,"This toy is very cute but can not be played with. It falls apart every 2 seconds and I do not have rough kids. They love this type of toy, but have lost interest in playing with it as the pieces you need to assemble do not stay on. (Kids can not put them back together as they are meant to click together ""permenently"") The plastic is the lowest grade possible. It feels like recycles aspirin bottles.This company should be ashamed for making such a shoddily made product."
2,Letdown,"This is one of the most poorly made toys I have seen in a long time. The plastic itself is cheap and thin. It does not come assembled, and when you do assemble it, it is so flimsy the pieces do not stay together. We have to reattach the parts multiple times each time our son plays with it. I would not recommend this product."
4,"Inexpensive, but lots of fun","I was hesitant to purchase this item because of the comments regarding how well it was made. No, it's not super high quality, but for the inexpensive price I paid, I think it was well worth it. I bought this for my son for his 3rd birthday and he absolutely loves it!! We also bought a Galactic Heroes X-Wing Star Fighter for him and so far, he prefers the less expensive Space Sation! Incidentally, the Galactic Heroes figures are the perfect size to fit with the Space Station, so he has been playing with both toys together."
3,Cheap,"My son got this for his 4th birthday and right away I knew we were going to have to super glue some of the pieces together. Even with the help of the glue this thing is constantly falling apart. Yes, it gets played with, but I expected a much better quality for the money I paid. If I had to do it again, I would not buy this toy. Try the odyssey toys instead."
4,Awesome Toy - Horrible Quality,"This toy was so cute, and my daughter was so excited about it, but almost immediatly it started to fall apart. It comes mostly put together, but there are a few pieces to snap in to place. Unfortunatly, they don't stay in place, they come apart with the slightest touch. The antenna broke off, the windows on the rover and shuttle don't stay closed. Overall, it is super cute, but really cheaply made."
3,Cheaply made,My son got this for his 3rd birthday. It is not well made and fell apart easily. We were constantly having to put it back together for him. Now a year later and he doesn't play with it anymore. The red door won't go back on.
1,Falls apart - pieces not meant to stay together,"I bought this for my son for Christmas thanks to that bald, little baby talking pain, Cailliu who got a space station for Christmas in his Holiday Movie. So I ordered this with high expectations that it would be my son's favorite toy. Unfortunately, it won't stay together. So the pieces that are meant to click in place, do but do not stay. Other parts that are supposed to are IMPOSSIBLE to get in place and the plastic is that hard, unbending, plastic that if you force will crack and break. If it weren't for Cailliu- don't get me started, I'd be returning this immediately. Definitely not worth forty-five dollars, not even worth fifteen. DO NOT BUY unless you want a space station that comes apart with the slightest bump."
4,Stars is easy to give - hard to reach,"I have to agree with Skarabati from Istanbul, this CD has to be scalled as: music 5 stars - collection 4 stars. But whatever, here is one thing we must not forget. This CD brings real music treasures to everyone who does not care where the music comes from. I would not agree with a words from our firend ""a music fan from Haifa Israel"". This is not new age music. We can agree with a fact that it is as he says ""Very unusual music with an arabic flavors"". But if you consider a fact that term ""Etno jazz"" exsists you will easy unterstand Night ark as an very clear contemporary fusion of etno music (that includes armenian and oriental roots) and jazz feeling in very wide sense. Their music is full, rich, emotional and openhearted. I would recomend it to everyone who is ahead of framing music into clichees."
4,music 5 stars - collection 4 stars,"Dear music fan from Haifa, Israel! I believe you'll need to decrease your rating to 3 stars simply because Treasures is a collection of pieces from Picture (1986, Novus) AND Moments (1988, Novus) :D These two early albums by Night Ark have long been unavailable (even in second-hand stores) - the release of this collection is more than timely for new listeners. However, it's a pity that the CD does not include Night Ark's rendition of standards You've Got A Friend and Over the Rainbow, the full version of Trilogy and the beautiful piece by Donelian, Nocturne."
5,"As first two NIGHT ARK Albums are not available in the US,","I authorize myself to give this album 5 stars. PICTURES and MOMENTS (the albums that contributed to this collection)are readily available anywhere but the US. I totally agree with my Croatian friend in that Armen Donelian's NOCTURNE (as well as my most favorite YAZOO-FIRAT) deserves to be part of any ""THE BEST OF NIGHT ARK"". However, I find this particular album a necessary contribution to American CD-market cause who knows when we'll have the first 2 CDs reissued. I'd advise anyone who liked NIGHT ARK to check all the CDs of Greek vocal Goddess Eleftheria Arvanitaki - she sings a lot of Ara Dinkjian's songs."
4,Needed History,"I like this book. I wish I had read this book before or shortly after I joined NABJ. That's because the book serves as a useful tool to navigate the politically charged organization. It gives you insights on who is connected to whom and who rivals whom.The story not only serves as a guide for the novice or the unaware, it is riveting. I also laughed out loud and felt inspired after reading it. It is an easy read because of the clear, crisp sentences, which propelled me along this fascinating journey with men and women who had strong convictions and the courage to lead."
4,just what I wanted,"This is a great machine. Lite weight and easy to operate. I would recomend this machine for anyone starting out or a seasoned sewer. It replaces my old dressmaker machine that is very heavy, and shakes the table. The new Brother machine is quiet and doesn't shake the table.Very easy to thread and has a automatic needle threader. Instructions are easy to understand. I love it!"
2,"Too hard to use, easily unthreads/gets stuck, instructions not clear","This machine is a nightmare, it is hard to use for my mother who is an experienced sewer and has been sewing since her 20's and sews very often. The machine is lacking in many simple thing such as the fact that the thread guide in step 4 doesn't stick out of the covering and so you have a hard time threading it, the needle threader instructions aren't clear and we still haven't figuredout how to use it, and the presser foot is just simply slid on rather than screwed tightly and so it often falls off if you move your hand over it while trying to thread the needle. This is so cheaply made and not at all user-friendly. It's a waste of $100. At least if you buy it at a proper store, you can try it out and have someone show you how to use it before you buy, by ordering online, you don't know what your getting nor have anyone to show you how to use it."
3,Major problems with bobbin case and tension,"I've had this machine for about 2 years and while I've been able to create lots of projects, a recurring problem has been inconsistent thread tension. Most recently, the bobbin case moves too much and the thread gets jammed and bunched up. I am probably using the wrong bobbin case and some of my thread are of poor quality, so these are likely contributing factors. I am now in the market for a new machine!"
5,Brother 31 Stitch Sewing Machine,"It's not the most powerful thing out there, you can't do a lot of sewing on very heavy fabrics or leather. You could make some light weight drapes but, upholstery fabric might be too much for this machine to handle.For the money it made a great gift for my daughter to sew on.Now she can make minor repairs to clothing or sew herself a nice dress."
3,2,"it is a good machine, much lighter then I expected in weight, it is easy movable from place to place. I had a lot of experience in sewing, so I did not have any trouble to figure out how it works, good purchace for occasional household use or for beginners[ASIN:B00016OYKA Brother XL2230 31-Stitch Function Free-Arm Sewing Machine With 11 Built-In Stitches]]"
2,Problems from the start...,"We ordered 7 of these machines for our school sewing class, and each machine is in use approximately 1-2 hours per week. Upon receipt, one of the machines would not work, and we received a replacement. We have now been using the machines for about 6 weeks, and have consistently had problems with the bobbin casing dislocating and causing the needle to jam or break. The sewing instructor, who has extensive sewing experience, used the word temperamental to describe them and said that they are a nightmare for the frustrated students attempting to learn to sew. They were reasonably priced, but I guess you get what you pay for."
5,very pleased,"I am very pleased with this machine. Easy to use, sews a variety of fabrics. I previously had a Brother machine that finally bit the dust after 26 years so I am hoping for comparable longevity."
5,on the mend,"i just got this machine and i love it,i've always had a diffrent brand but this one is so smooth and light weight and it sure does alot for the money and your shipping service was faster then i thought thank you amazon.RoseBelleose N.Y."
4,Good,"Good product, I am a beginner, just made a few saws with it, but was really easy to use, and very complete, good for the price, looks good quality too."
5,Great Basic Machine,"I got this as a gift (purchased from Amazon), and have only used it a couple of times. However, compared to my old Singer, this machine is great! Having said that, I need to disclose that I hate sewing, and will only use this for very basic repairs. I don't know how I'd feel about this if I were an expert seamstress.Pros:Very lightweight.Easy to set up.Easy to wind a bobbin.Love the automatic threader, especially with my eyesight not being so great.Cons:I wish the light was more centrally located, and brighter.Nothing else so far."
2,Poor quality,"I've had this machine little more than two weeks, and every day I run into some sort of problem. For $100 you can't expect great quality, and you certainly don't get it with this machine."
1,Not again!,"This work is both long (nearly 500 pages) and recently published (2003) so it woud be easy to assume that some new information would be presented about the colourful hstory of the Grimaldi family. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Mr. Taraborelli retells the same story of the ""fairy tale gone wrong"" that has been related in countless other books and magazines in the decades following the death of Grace de Monaco. Further, the author's plodding, amateurish and hackneyed style makes the task of searching for any new revelations a tedious one indeed. A boorish waste of time."
2,Very disapponting,"I have been a Tilt fan a few years now, and was anxiously awaiting their new album. This album was a total let down. There are maybe two songs that hit me half as much as all the songs on the last two CDs. I'll tape them and and sell the CD. If you want to listen to Tilt, get one of their other CDs"
2,Looks better in the pics than in person,"Okay, for the price its a good watch. It is sporty and kind of has a rolex-like vibe. However, the picture makes it seem much more impressive than it is. I ordered it, and it looked okay but it felt flimsy and cheap. So I sent it back and got an different ESQ that was perfect on all accounts. Of course, I was buying for someone who is quite particular about watches."
5,A Handfull of Great Live Tracks,The 4 live tracks from the Bottom Line Concert are a real treat. It's a shame they didn't release a lot more of it.
4,Australia rocks!,"Ok, I'm biased. As an Aussie who now lives in America, I thought this would be a good addition to my 4 year old's Christmas gift of ""Baby Born with Magic Potty"".The outfit is cute and my daugher asked immediately for it to be put on her new doll. The koala bear is cute too.I'm not sure I'd pay $19.99 for it though, wait for it to be on sale!"
4,Getting There,"I may be a little biased in my review of ""Getting There"", since my grand uncle Roy and my grandfather John Fitzgerald (pages 123-137)played such a significant role in the transformation from the trolley to the bus.Interestingly, this expansive transportation network was created by American entrepreneurs with no public funds and ran at a profit that public transportation doesn't seem to be able to do today.This was accomplished during the the Great Depression era and may be a more poignent lesson today during our current economic times."
4,"This trailer will not attach to the Mack, MAN or Scania Trucks","I bought this trailer based on the previous review to attach to my MAN dump truck. Be advised that this trailer will NOT attach to any of the Mack, MAN or Scania trucks. Its pintile is too small to fit over the hitch pegs on these trucks. It will however attach to the tractors. I have read that it will attach to the 1:16 ERTL tractors with some minor modifications, so I am going to order one to verify that. Will post the results."
5,Very good,"Product received to me within 3 days of purchase. Looks brand new, and was purchased for a very low cost."
5,Excellent. Well worth the money.,"This book is a must for any aviation buff. It is a facinating story of secret aircraft development, and should be read with Ben Rich's Skunk Works.The final chapter on the truth about the Aurora was worth the money alone."
3,Jump on the Bandwagon,"This book is a reasonable introduction to the world of aviation 'Black Programs', but use it as a stepping stone to titles such as Ben Rich's or Jay Miller's books on Lockheed's Skunk Works.Competent rather than outstanding"
3,Too bad they didn't get away,"I am a true Sarah Brightman fan but this CD was a total waste of money and the time I spent listening to it. With only a couple of exceptions the songs, (and Ms. Brightman's renditions) are totally forgettable. I will never again buy a Sarah Brightman album without first listening to it.I have to re-visit this revue.Since I originally wrote the revue I have come to enjoy several of the songs on this album. It just takes a little time. I have raised it to three stars."
3,Why The Puccini Aria?,"Sara Brightman's pleasent but limited voice finds a good home in the wonderful world of Broadway.However, she has no business singing Puccini's ""Chi il bel sogno di Doretta""! She completely lacks the volume, power, and musical espression essential to convey this song effectively. Listen to a clip of Renee Fleming performing this masterpiece and you'll see what I mean!"
2,worst of the best,"From a true fan, my preferences puts this album/CD as the WORST of her many other BEAUTIFUL recordings. Had to do over, money better spent would go towards purchases of her others! Very very beautiful voice has Sarah!"
4,a whole bunch of Broadway,"Okay, maybe I'm just a walking oxymoron, but of all of the things Ms. Brightman does, her Broadway repetoire impresses me least. It just isn't my thing. I still love her work, don't get me wrong, just know what you're getting into when you buy this. If you love Broadway-musical stuff, this is for you."
4,A Facet of Sarah's Repertoire,"Although this is not my favorite Sarah Brightman CD, I can't imagine my collection being complete without it. This is a collection of mostly obscure show tunes. Unlike her performances of recent Lloyd-Webber songs, these pieces are a bit older.In my opinion, some of the songs deserve to rest in obscurity while others are very nice. I find myself skipping around the CD to listen to four or five favorites. Sarah's renditions are, of course, uniformly beautiful.I enjoy hearing her sing things in the George Gershwin/Irving Berlin genre and would recommend the CD to dyed-in-the-wool Sarah Brightman fans. Those who only like to hear her sing operatic or new age material will probably want to pass on it."
4,Best of Sarah,"I have to admit from the beginning that I'm not a much of a Sarah Brightman fan. I find her ""new"" style of operatic singing to be very affected. I also have a hard time watching her sing because of the strange things she does with both her arms and mouth. (Having had extensive classical vocal training myself, I can't really understand how she gets the sound she does with how she holds herself and positions her mouth.) However, this album was recorded before her voice teacher, with some very strange and old-school ideas, got hold of her. Her voice is very fresh, and the songs are fun. If you enjoy less-familiar tunes, both Broadway and opera-operetta, this CD is for you."
1,TERRIBLY DISSAPOINTED,This could have been a fantastic album if the sound people had done a better job. On many songs her voice can barely be heard. The music is great. The singing is great. The album stinks.
3,A heroine....a LANDMARK?,"Now, don't think that I'm trashing Sarah Brightman; I respect her as a heroine with attitude, no goddes but just an average person with unique styles. However, I don't think this CD is really up to it like her later releases are. There are some good tracks but most of the rest don't cut the mustard. Only really recommended for die-hard theater and SB fans. She's got better works out there."
2,BIG disappointment,"Well, they should have let these songs stay lost. This was not very good at all. I did not like the song selection. Her voice was good, but the songs were rather limp; not what I call easy to listen to or to get into. I love it when she sings opera though, so maybe that is why I don not like this one at all. I suppose if you like show tunes that never were popular, you might like this CD. I should have listened to the previous posts!!!"
2,Now I know why they got away,"I am a big fan of Ms. Brightman and own and enjoy a number of her CDs, but this one, frankly, is disappointing. She just cannot rescue music that lacks orignality and excitment. As a result, her deliveries are uninspired. There are few tracks on this CD worth listening to more than once. Alas! This case will be gathering dust unitl my next garage sale."
4,"Dear Listener, Do You Know Any of THESE Songs?","This album is ""no longer made,"" but I happened to find the only available copy of this album at the Virgin Megastore on Union Square here in New York City. These are songs from musicals that never achieved popularity. If you're interested in this album, get it here on the net."
5,Good music.,"My sister-in-law is a Sarah Brightman fan. She said she plays this over and over in her car.Good product, good service."
5,Fun and Exsiting Book,"This is a very exciting book. When Sally moves to Florida she goes to a school that she absolutely loves because there is a boy named Peter that she really loves. When she meets a guy named Mr.Zavodsky she thinks that he is Hitler in desguise.I think this book would be for someone who likes adventure,laughter,girl talk and goofing around. So if you have some spare time read Staring Sally J. Freedmen As Herself."
1,"NOT HER BEST, BUT...","This book is not Judy Blume's best work, but its good for a boring summer day. It is about a girl named Sally who moves to a new home in Florida, leaving her friends behind. That's pretty much it. It tells how she adjusts to her new home and tries to follow her dreams of becoming a ballerina. This book has no plot, detail, or consistency. The only historical aspect is a couple of references to World War II. Like we haven't had enough of THOSE books. Here's a tip, just save your money and borrow it from the local library. The plot is so inert, I cannot even remember anything to describe almost. If you had to choose between reading this book and watch Lawrence Welk with your parents, go for Lawrence Welk, there's more action in a segment of that than there is in the entire book."
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL ADVENTUROUS AND NON GIRLS!!!!!!,"This book is great! After Sally J. Freedman's brother gets a kidney infection, they move to Miami Beach in a cozy little apartment, and the adventure starts there, from making friends, and leading to kissing Peter Hornstein, her Latin lover!!!"
3,Starring Sally J. Freedman as Herself,"Starring Sally J. Freedman as Herself is about a Jewish girl growing up right after World War Two. It talks about Sally's relationship with her family and friends, about her struggles with moving to a different state and about the recently-ended war. While the issues in this book are a little shallow, it very realistically portrays Sally and the various other characters."
3,Strange and weird...but in a good way!,"I chose this book because the other books that I saw looked boring, and this was the only book the drew my attention. Once I opened the book I did not like it. I have to say, the first few pages were kind of boring, but once I got going I couldn't stop, its the kind of book that you hate to love. I love Judy Blume books only because she writes thing that are realistic, and at this point I am loving her books. This book is strange because she thinks that a man named Mr. Zavodsky is Aldolf Hitler in disguise, and my goodness this girl lopves listening to peoples' phone calls. It is also weird because I have never heard of Man-O-Wars. Have u? Well if I have interested you in any way, then you should really read this book."
4,Very Cute!!,Sally finds just the right way to say everything. Her imagination is always out of control and that keeps her going throughout this entire book. I really enjoyed it!!
2,A Cute Book for the Younger Crowd....,"Well, first off, I'll tell you that at 14, believe or not, this was the first Judy Blume book i've ever read. I mainly chose this book becuase im into 40's pop-culture and fashion, and, well, I liked the cover. About that. Sally looks a bit older than she turned out to be on it(I thought she may have been in her early teens...), so I thought this book may be suitable for my age group...As it turned out, she was a little imaginative 10 yr. old girl who made up stories and dreamed of being a ballerina...BUT, I still found it to be a fairly entertaining book, but which had no real plot to it. It really turned out to be a kids book. I sort-of think of Sally as the Anne of Green Gables of the Late 40's...I think maybe Tiger Eyes may appeal to me more..."
4,"Una lectura interesante, amena, entretenida y buena.","Este es el primer libro que leo de Restrepo, y fácilmente se delata la influencia al estilo García Márquez, y sin embargo, mateniendo un estilo muy auténtico, muy apegado a las cosas cotidiantas con sus elementos fantasiosos característicos del realismo mágico, claro. Muy parecido a Allende, también discípula del Maestro.La historia es fácil de seguir, amena y se desarrolla en eventos a partir de personajes cuyos acontecimientos se relatan asociándolos con el personaje principal, una mujer, tal cual Allende también acostumbra hacerlo en sus famosas novelas (no me refiero a sus últimas destinadas a una audiencia más juvenil).El final, está muy bien, aunque personalmente lo sentí un tanto sobrio, pero no me quejo, mucho mejor que los forzados finales prolongados y ""resuelvetodo"".Recomiendo el libro como una buena alternativa para continuar con los ""clásicos"" (por decirlo de algún modo) de Allende y García Márquez."
4,A hidden treasure!,"Wow! I didn't even mean to find this in our local bookstore. There was one copy in the way back and it had me interested by the cover. Its wonderfully written with action, adventure, and love. I love how you find out about the main characters life and how she became the way she is before she starts out on her adventure. It also shows that just because you are a 50+ woman, doesn't mean you forget about how powerful love can be. I thought it was slow at first but it really picked up. If you are in the mood for witty and action packed (at least 2/3 packed) book, this one is for you. My review might not be as great as the others here, but I really enjoyed this book, take a chance and i hope you do too."
3,Half good but half bad,"I finished this book and the only reason that I finished it was because my library was closed. This book waivers across too many genres. It is about time travel and explores the ideas of paradox, wormholes, and the math involved. But I have just gone as deep as the book did in these areas. Then it changes to a fantasy book, then a 18th century religious-political book, then finally a love book. At no point does this book really suck, but at no point does it really stand out.I found that it read really slow and at the end of the book it sounded like Ms. Giardina got tired of the characters and finished the book.I am not angry that I read the book but I also cannot suggest the book to anyone."
2,de ja vu,"As I started reading this novel, I was struck by the many similarities between Fallam's Secret and The Outlander Series by Diana Galbaldon. Given the choice, I would strongly urge someone to read The Outlander series instead. As a reviewer before noted, Diana Gabaldon's books really give you a feel for the past and more insight into the characters. Fallam's Secret so closely resembles The Outlander series, that I was able to predict many scenes and the end of the book. If you have already read Diana Gabaldon's books, go ahead and read this and see if you come to the same conclusions."
5,"A very positive respone to ""Beside The sleeping Maiden""","C.B.Follett's ""Beside The Sleeping Maiden"" is cause for rejoicing. She has gathered poetry and art work reflecting the creative spirit alive in Marin County. It is a coming together of the varied elements making up the rich, spiritual/aesthetic soup that nourishes so many Marinites.This is a feast that will satisfy the appetites of sophisticated as well as general readers, and it is served up in a handsome, imaginative and generous volume that will grace any bookshelf.................Ruth Daigon, editor of ""Poets On:"
4,A bit of history...,"Le Corbusier had been working for some time on his Modulor system using these French decimal measurements but without much success. Then one of his collaborators, Py, said: ""Isn't the height we are working with rather a French height? Have you ever noticed that in English detective novels the hero is always six feet tall?"" Le Corbusier continues: "" We then applied this standard. To our delight, the graduations of a new Modulor, based on a man six feet tall, translated themselves into round figures in feet and inches"". (hardly surprising when you consider that this is a natural system of measure.)."

1,not the real product,I just received my bottle of jaqua buttercream frosting lotion and i am very disappointed. The lotion is very watered down and you cant even smell it after you put it on. I think that the bottle was filled with a different kind of lotion bcause i had this product a couple years back and it was completely different. I'm very angry that i wasted 21 dollars on this..Word of advice DON'T BUY LOTION ONLINE UNLESS FROM THE COMPANY!
2,"Unfortunately, it misses the mark.","I am a big fan of reading about, eating, and preparing southern Italian food. Unfortunately, ""Regional Foods of Southern Italy"" did not live up to my hopes and expectations for two reasons. First, many of the preparations are too complex to reflect the simplicity of southern Italian cooking. The ornate recipe for ""caponata,"" a simple, delicious Sicilian classic, is a good example. Second, the prose is seriously overwrought, and constantly deterred me from enjoying the rich historical and cultural material the author compiled for this book. In all candor, there are other books about southern Italy, its cultures, and its foods that are superior to this one in both content and style."
4,Very Informative,Was interesting and helped me understand the way food was approached for my trip to Rome. I was very satisfied.
4,four seasons,This book follows a little girl who lives on a farm through the four seasons. It starts out in spring and the little girl plants a sunflower seed by her door. She tells us about Spring turning into summer. In summer on her fam her family has a roadside stand where they sell corn and squash. September rolls around and fall comes to the farm. Pumpkins are now he crop of choice at her family's stand. December comes soon and it's winter on the farm. She has saved the sunflower seeds from the flower she has planted and feeds then to the birds.I liked the illustrations in the book. They were bright and colorful and added lots to the text.This is a wonderful picture book for kids and a great resource for teachers when teaching about plant life and the four seasons.
5,Who says you can't go back ...,"I only read a few of the these books when I was a young boy in the mid to late 1960's. I had found my first one (the one about a ""Mexican Idol"" in my local library. It was a fun read that had definitely caught my interest. At that time I was a huge Hardy Boy fan, picking up a book each time my allowance added up to the cost of a book. I never did get to build a collection of the Happy Hollisters, so now I am correcting that error by working my way through the series as it becomes available for my Kindle library. In my 50's and reading children's books again!, --- and enjoying them as much as the first time around!"
5,Do-si-do with a Rattler!,"Jack Rabbit is boastful. He crows that he can dance with a rattler without getting bit. He can scare off a whole herd of longhorn cattle. He can run so fast he can skedaddle through a skunk's burrow without getting all stunk-up. He's so brave he can kiss all the coyotes up on Tabletop Rock!Fox tells Jack Rabbit that he could ""talk the tail off a turkey vulture and never tell a lick of truth."" Gila Monster adds that Jack Rabbit is ""all gurgle and no guts."" They dare him to kiss the coyotes.This action-packed story and its boisterous drawings roar along, with lots of great lingo appropriate to a blabber-mouth braggart!"
5,great talent,"I TRULY ENJOY THIS CD BECAUSE TO PUT SOUNDS,FEELINGS,TONES, IMPRESSION ,MOVEMENTS TOGETHER IS TRULY A ACCOMPLISMENT. I HAVE NO HESITION TO TURN IT UP ."
1,. . .,"if you're a genuine house head...you'll find this cd garbage...do not be fooled...the song ""king of my castle"" is not the version you're looking for...there might be one or two okay songs on here...but they are definitely not worth buying the whole album"
4,A bit of pinch,"This is a great product if you're doing home grooming as I am. One small word of caution however, if the dog moves around a bit, the rubber coating, particularly the one used behind the dog's belly can pinch or create a red welt if you're not careful. Our Mini Schnauzer had a welt for a few days caused by the drag of the rubber coating over this sensitive area of skin. Since then, I've wrapped it in soft cloth to avoid future welting problems."
5,Very helpful for home grooming,"My pooch has always been one to turn around and sit down when I'm trying to groom is back feet, tail, belly, etc. This Haunch Holder is a wonder at keeping my dog standing - and he seems to be less bothered by my grooming now that he can't escape it."
3,Disc 2 non-existent,"I have to echo the comments of the prior reviewer here. There is no disc 2 with this particular item. I ordered this, looking forward to the extended tracks on the bonus disc, but what arrived had only one disc (disc 1 above). I spoke with amazon customer service, so they sent another copy (while I returned the original), and that too had only one disc. It's great Bangles music on that disc, but don't get your hopes up about any bonus disc..."
4,It does the job,The drain grate is light weight metal but strong enough to not bend if stepped on.It keeps the soap from going down the drain and keeps you safe from the drain monsters. That's about all you can expect from a product like this.
4,Great book for Fighting Irish fans,"This is a great book for fans of the Fighting Irish. It delves into and gives great accounts of 20 of the biggest games in Notre Dame history.From the ""Gipper"" game to Notre Dame's huge victory over Miami on the road to their National Championship in 1988 to the ""Game of the Century"" in 1993, this covers most of the biggest moments in Notre Dame history.The DVD is nice for showing highlights of a lot of these games. (Though I wonder why some of the footage from later years looks like practice film instead of TV broadcast tape.)The book is the best part. It doesn't just give a play-by-play of each game, but talks about the interesting stories leading up to and after the games.Seminole fans, stay home."
3,"I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the cable, but...","The cable seemed like just what we were looking for when it arrived. However - be very aware before you buy this that the S-video is a 4 pin connector. This does not work with some video cards, which also have an S-video connection - a 9 pin connection. This cable will not plug into a 9 pin connector. We have yet to find a suitable adapter to make this work.As I said, probably nothing wrong with the cable itself - just make sure it is exactly what you need!"
2,Sound CHECK,"The cord serves it purpose well, but there are some major malfunctions. First the pros. The picture quality is GREAT. Bravo. Sadly, the sound has major problems. There will be lots of static that appears randomly throughout viewing. I thought it might be the TV, but the static expresses itself on multiple TVs. I also know it is not the computer because i plug in other speakers and the sound is fine. This leaves me with one big problem with the cord, any time I want to watch something from the net on my TV, I have to expect to not be able to hear certain parts and put up with the annoying static."
5,awesome cable,"With this s-video to 3 rca cable set up is a breaze. Just plug the one end into your computer and the other to the tv or possibly a dvd burner. The picture comes thru perfectly,actually so does the sound. We have our tv run through a home theatre system so its great. I haven't had any problems so far, I highly recommend this cable if you want to watch movies or even if you have a wireless keyboard & mouse and just want to use the tv as a bigger monitor."
4,Very Good!!!,"Purchased these to be able to watch online TV shows (on Hulu.com, Joost.com, major networks and local channels, etc.) from my computer on my good, old analog tv, when we could no longer afford cable. Works great! Picture is very good, sound is, too. Not perfect, but very good and FREE tv! We had to figure out the correct settings on our computer, initially, but after that, it's smooth sailing! Lots of free tv, when WE want to watch it! This is better than cable tv! Fewer commercials, too! Cables are heavy, very sturdy, seem to be of good quality, better than expected, 25ft. length is nice; plugs are sturdy and strong. Very happy! Have paid for themselves by not needing cable tv. Would purchase again!"
2,Power Tap connections do not work.,"Power Tap connectors were included in four Amertac products (20 watt Xenon accents lights) that I purchased, and not one of them worked. You can buy alternative connectors to use in place of the Power Tap connectors. If you don't believe me, buy the product, but before screwing to the wall/cabinet/whatever, connect and plug into an outlet. Bingo--they don't work!"
2,sorry I bought this one,"very poorly done, wast off time watching, first you hear Masaru Emoto, then the translater, did not even watch it to the end, they could at least have the audio worked out."
1,"Get the Book, not the DVD","1. This DVD is difficult/impossible to see the crystals.2. The interpreter is difficult/impossible to hear.3. There is a scene in this DVD where Dr. Emoto uses his wife to demonstrate how vibration/energy transfers. First he hits himself on the head, then HE HITS HIS WIFE'S HEAD; then he insults his wife by saying his wife's vibration is lower; then acts like he is funny!! GET A CLUE!"
2,"NOT the deaf man, and not satisfying, either ...","This was NOT a return of the deaf man. (What book was he reading??)I won't give any plot away, as that would spoil the fun. I've read a dozen or more of the 87th precinct books, and this one was rather weak. I get frustrated with books that rely on a gimmick that gets revealed in the last 5 pages. I think that a novel should be rewarding throughout, giving out nuggets of the solution along the way, instead of making it impossible for the reader to figure out until the author pulls back the curtain at the very end."
3,ok,"readable, not really enjoyable. I have to really work hard at keeping up with the plot and stay interested in it"
4,"Longer, darker, and more complex than his others","For fans of the 87th Precinct, this one will be a welcome change of pace. The writing is still pure McBain--terse, witty, and in some areas, lyrical. The dialogue sizzles, all of our old boys in blue are back, and things feel like home again--the way they always do when you open one of the tales of the 87th. But home can also be a boring place, and sometimes a chance of pace and a twist here and there will remedy that. Well, twists and turns abound in this book, a departure from the previous 87 novels in its legnth, complexity of backstory, and nifty tidbits of info--from psychoanalysis to the training of the blind--to sustain readers' interests. The ending is classic McBain, blunt, to the point, and supremely satisfying. Not since ""Sadie When She Died"" has McBain produced so unique a novel in this incredibly durable series."
1,Cat spring toy,"Pretty cheap, but pretty useless. So small and hard, if you leave them on the floor they will either end up under the nearest furniture, or getting underfoot and it is a foot breaker!!"
3,Works for Some & Not Others,"I really thought my cats would love this because they love springs and twist ties. So I got them these and like any other cat, they enjoyed the packaging better than the toy. I'll stick with pipe cleaners. But hey, mine don't like it, I'm sure others will!"
1,"Thin metal wire, chipped paint, rough edges. Not the plastic rings by Spot",This product is a thin base metal wire spring with cheap paint that chips off. The edges are sharp. This is not the plastic spring made by Spot. These are going back.
5,Great!,"The cats love them, and so do I! I have ordered more, since out of the original 10 I got at the beginning of January, I can only find 3. Under the stove. None under the bed, refrigerator, or in the linen closet. Thankfully they are reasonably priced!"
5,Perfect Toy,"My cats LOVE these things and will play with them endlessly. They have the slightly larger ones, but the smaller ones are their favorite. It's fun to watch them amuse themselves with such a simple toy."
2,more attractive to people than cats,"Nicely made, nice colors. And the cats couldn't care less. Not a hit at my house. They don't even touch them."
5,These are THE cat toy you've been looking for!!!,"These entertain my cat for HOURS. He pounces on them, chases them (they are springy so bounce around a little like a Nerf football does, going in different directions), and carries them around. He hides them in various places. He brings them to me to play fetch. He chews everything, destroying it, but has not destroyed even one of these (he has already had surgery for removal of previous toys, so we are very careful what he is offered as a toy.) These are rugged, don't hurt your feet if you step on them barefoot, and you don't have to supervise play with them. Mine have lasted 8 months now! I hope you will agree they are the perfect toy for your kitty, too!"
3,"Durable and colorful, but my cat couldn't care less.....","These are very durable and colorful and they can make a cute little sound when they roll across a tile floor, but my cat is totally UNinterested in them. She may swat one, if I put it right in front of her, but then she just walks away. I think she's the feather and felt kinda cat and not into metal."
1,Beautiful until it fails. And it will.,"Bought mine from Amazon 3 years ago. I love the size and the perfect pixels.The power supply failed after a month. Samsung service botched the repair ticket- they closed it without doing anything. The executive relations department was helpful in getting it sorted out. They even cross-shipped a replacement monitor so I wouldn't have to wait for round-trip shipping.The replacement monitor has now failed. (It's lost sync, so the green image is way out of alignment with the red and blue.) I spent an hour text ""chatting"" with a support person who was friendly in a glacially slow, robotic sort of way. The support bot tells me that Samsung can't repair this monitor. They've run out of repair parts and don't ever plan to have any more.I'm not surprised. Read the reviews and you'll see that these things have a terrible failure rate."
2,Beutiful until..... it breaks,"I have owned this monitor since February 2009, it was all good and dandy until it broke a week ago, not what you expect from a $1,258 monitor, unfortunately I did not read the reviews on this site about this monitor, only the good ones that appeared on C-Net (Back then, because now you can read many disenchanted buyers whose monitors broke even earlier than mine) otherwise I certainly would not have purchased it. STAY AWAY FROM IT, DON'T BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOURSELF THE HASLE OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH SAMSUNG CUSTOMER ""DISERVICE"""
2,"Looks good, but have had to replace 2!","The color is good, but they generate a ton of heat. And, I am on my second RMA. Lines and static in the pixels. Not recommended."
4,"Samsung SyncMaster 305T 30"" LCD Monitor - great resolution","I love this high resolution monitor. I have a dual DVI card and also hae a 20"" Apple cinema on the same card. I much refer the Sinymaster 305T to the Apple monitor. It seems twice as big and I can view more programs a once. Has black frame. You will need a DVI video card that handles high resolution.I bought a 40"" Toshiba monitor/(TV)for my recruiter but it is so tall you have to look up. Aloha,"
1,Horrible warranty support,"I had the same monitor ""dying"" experience as some of the other reviewers.Screen suddenly started flashing one day and the whole thing went dead.Returned it for repair and Samsung kept me in limbo state for the last 3 months.The process went from repair->exchange->refund state after hours spent withconfused reps. It seemed that the process is designed to wear the consumerout, with multiple departments passing the buck.Today I was notified that my refund has been canceled without any reason.I have to call back in a few days to find the reason for the cancellation.Will never buy Samsung again. I have already bought my TV from them, and it isa nightmare to think what would happen if it went dead like the monitor.My only recourse is the small claims/consumer court if they cancel my refund."
1,Could not get one to work!,"I was going to buy the Apple 30"" but after reading the reviews I chose the Samsung 30"". The first one I received did not work out of the box, I called Samsung they said it was a defective monitor, send back. I returned it back to Amazon and Amazon sent me a new one. The second one doesn't work either. I called Samsung again and again they said it was a defective monitor. Sorry Samgsung I won't be buying your products again."
1,"Unreliable, bad repair experience","Broke after two years. Repaired under warranty. Broke again in a year while two months out warranty. Paid for repair and shipping. Monitor came back with terrible diffranctions, garbage colors etc. I'm not even sure they sent back my monitor, instead they sent probably somebody else's trouble.Time to put Samsung on the no-buy brand list."
1,Stopped Working After 9 Months,"The monitor looked great and worked fine for nine months. Then out of the blue, It now flickers and has horizontal flashing white lines. Now that I look for those reviews... I see several others have had the same problem. I have confirmed it was the monitor and not the computer and so I will contact Samsung tomorrow. I hope the other reviews about how bad their customer support is were exaggerations."
2,"good for two years, but watch out for repair merry-go-round","i bought this two years ago and was very pleased with it until it started showing green shadows. then i entered repair hell, thanks to samsung's local repair people Amkotron. short story: after two trips to amkotron (luckily they were close enough that i could take it in myself and didnt have to compound the problem waiting for the ups cycle) it still doesnt work--different new problem each time. STAY AWAY FROM AMKOTRON"
2,Lasts one year and then starts going crazy,"I read the other reviews about this monitor breaking after a year, took the risk, and hoped it would miss me, it didn't. Once the warranty ran out, the monitor ""broke."" By ""broke"" I mean it doesn't work 100% of the time. The monitor screen will go black and then come back. Sometimes the picture is normal, the other times it looks like static noise. Some times it will do this three or four times in a row, with me hoping it lands in a non-static noise state. It's random when it does this, sometimes it will do it every 10 minutes, maybe once a day.When it works, it looks nice. However, for the price, and the low quality of this product, I would avoid purchasing this product.This, along with my Samsung TV randomly turning off, has cause me to avoid Samsung products."
2,Just died after 2 yrs :-(,"It worked great - until untimely death.First, screen started to flicker slightly.Then a wide band of vertical lines appeared. Each line ~1 pixel thick, different color.Disconnected monitor - it still shows same band. 305T cycles thru basic colors when disconnected. And I still have Dell LCD around which is fine after 4+ yrs.Got replacement in about 3 weeks. It died after a week - suddenly it started blinking with thin vertical color lines.2nd replacement works so far (4th month now)"
3,Beware a refurbished item...,"I have owned one of these for more than 3 years. I really like it and have had no issues with it.When setting up a new office, I bought two of these and due to price, went for refurbished items that came with a 90 day warranty. At 102 days, one of the items developed a problem with black streaks all the way through the middle. I called the vendor and they said there was nothing they could do for me. They stated the item was refurbished by Samsung, but only came with a 90 day warranty.The other refurbished monitor is still working fine. So, I have 50% success so far with refurbished items. I have a long term success rate still going when buying a new item."
4,"Great product, poor manual","Because of the poorly written pamphlet that passes for a manual it took me a while to determine that the monitor wasn't broken on arrival. It was never made clear that there was a hidden ""on"" switch in the back as well as the one on the front. Turning the monitor on via the front switch without turning on the back switch resulted in an apparently dead monitor. Once I got it working, though, it works great. It would be nice to have better brightness, gamma and color controls though."
3,Just one input?,"Ya gotta be kidding me JUST ONE INPUT? Is this 1990? Check out the cost of a DUAL Link KVM switch before you spend for this.Now that you can cross this beast off your candidate list, I'll advise you to beware of other multiple input monitors with USB hubs. Most of them only have one upstream USB input so you'll still need a USB K(V)M switch to run two computers.It is as if the designers never actually use their products. Such obvious deal breaking feature omissions..."
2,Great - while it lasts...,"A fine monitor, but...Mine stopped working after 9 months. Waited 2 months for a replacement, only to be told that they had no replacement units in stock. That's right: Samsung don't have any more of these. Still waiting for a refund and determined never to buy from Samsung again.So, a great deal while it works. If anything goes wrong, expect to waste a lot of time and energy dealing with their customer service and don't expect them to replace your unit."
4,Good picture but no multiple inputs,"The picture you get from this monitor is better than the Dell monitor, photos just look sharper and the color is better. It only has one DVI input. Be very careful when you purchase a DVI cable for this monitor ( the one it comes with is about three feet long!) you must get the DVI-I or something like that. If you get the other DVI cable it will not fit. Overall it is a good monitor and gives excellent quality right out of the box."
2,Very poor ROI,"I'll make this short and sweet. We bought the 305T 30"" Samsung display as a good value (or so we thought). It lasted just over 4 years and is no longer repairable by a Samsung service center. At our company we have not yet had a LCD completely fail like this. It flickers badly. Others apparently had the same experience so we will not continue with Samsungs products. What a waste of $1200."
1,Broke after 4 years. Convenient for Samsung!,"I took great care of this monitor. Only used it 2 or 3 days a week and i never left it on just ""running"". I kept the brightness down to preserve the lifespan, not that it did any good. I'll never buy a samsung product again. Almos 4 years to the day after i bought it new. And then all the sudden i started getting a green cast and flickering bands of color. Hard to belie i paid $1,230. for this piece of crap."
3,Awesome monitor but broke after about 1.5 years. Samsung fixed it.,"Awesome monitor but broke after about 1.5 years. Samsung fixed it but gave me a hassle - they wouldn't send me a replacement so I had to ship mine for fixing. They wouldn't send me an empty box and told me I was responsible for shipping charges. I found out they have a depot nearby and after demanding that they allow me to drop it off myself, I was finally ""allowed"" to bring it by car.After about a month without my monitor they shipped it fixed.Monitor is great otherwise, but obviously has some gremlin inside and Samsung customer service sucks. I hope I won't have a repeat failure with it."
3,I read it for tech info. It's probably more useful to a reloader.,I'd buy a newer version next time. Some calibers weren't available at the publication of this version.
4,Good show,I like the show overall and consider it worthwhile to watch. I like the main characters especially. As a comedy in today's programing I rate this one above average. The average comedy shows of today are very lacking. Only Monk and Psych are better than this show.
2,This is to easy.,"If your planning on going by the seven and up on the package then just don't bother wasting your money.I know I wasted mine. After openning up the package I was very dispointed in how little the giga actualy did. I had expected something like the old gigapets of my younger days, not something that didn't do a thing.All it really involves is moving your pet here and there and collecting personality points. The pet may get sick, hungry, dirty, or bored, but it never dies. I'm not really suprized by some of these kids reveiws. It just doesn't have all that much to keep a child interested, much less someone my age. If they had given these new Gigas some of the old Gigas fun maybe they would have had something to go on, but these have nothing."
4,Grandson Gift,Gift for 5 year old grandson. Product was perfect and he like it very much. Great choice for young recipients
4,Favourite video,"Video tape, although quite old, plays perfectly - now available to a new generation of my family"
4,A wonderful book!!,"When I bought this book, I needed a focus when it came to motherhood. I simply felt overwhelmed and undone to say the least. The introduction alone, inspired me to get up off my hinny and become a better mother. I now how a focus--a Purpose! This is more of a motivational book then a how-to and it was exactly what I needed. I needed to find my drive again. I already know the things I need to be doing, but I had lost my staminia in the race of parenthood."
4,finding your purpose as a mom,This book was bought as part of a Bible Study group and we are finding it very helpful in keeping us focused on providing Christ centered homes for our families.
3,Unsatisfacation,"Waiting a few days to buy it, in fact, I am a little disappointed. This is my first time to rank just 3 star for Manze ablum, comparied to my earily views Bach, Biber and Vivaldi. The key is that the loosing structure. Why did I say that? For Tartini's Devil sonata, it's very important of strong expression, I couldn't find it in this disc, but get more constrast voice between loud and soft.Yes, Manze's violin is beautiful as before, but lack of tension. Comparied to others, I like Grumiaux's more."
2,Pretty bad,"this is just bad. No sense of continuity to the music whatsoever. I listened to it once, and that will be the end of that. A complete waste of money."
4,This Guy Can Croon!,"This CD is my first exposure to Bill Black. His voice is very smooth and the choice of songs seem to make them flow into each other. Listening to the CD, I can understand how Gene Krupa hired him for his band's vocalist. This is a mono recording (as most were before 1958). However, it is an excellent restoration. Especially interesting are the notes about Mr. Black's history and how the CD producer came to obtain the source material."
1,Does NOT work reliably with MS Vista !!!,"I do not rate this product at all, as it doesn't come with Vista drivers and does not work reliably (if at all) with XP drivers under Vista.I have tested the hardware on another computer with XP, and it seems fine. But on Vista I get conflicts with other devices (eg WiFi, USB Controller), obviously caused by the lack of a proper Vista driver.I am using a Sony Vaio VGN-SZ38 (similar to SZ360, etc) with Vista Business."
5,Faster picture downloads,"I've been using this for a couple of weeks now. The performance of this adapter with a *fast* CF or Microdrive is awesome - I can download at least 3 times faster than I could with a standard (16 bit) PC card adapter - I think even faster than my FireWire CF card reader.However, if you try this with the typical 4x speed CF card, you'll see no difference, because even a 12x and a 40x card seem to run at about the same speed on a 16-bit PC adapter.This Cardbus adapter seems to be able to get every last bit out of the faster CF cards."
1,No 64 bit support,There is no support for 64 bit Vista. By no support I mean- no driver available on their web site- no information about when it might be available- no response to numerous messages sent to tech support.Save your money and buy something else.
4,Delkin Devices Cardbus 32-Bit Hi Speed,Easy to install and blazing fast transfer speed. Only drawback is that i have to take the cardbus out to pull my memory card out. No biggie...transfer speed is what i needed and got.ET
1,It doesn't work under Vista,"While product promises you Vista compatibility unfortunately its driver hungs Vista machine.Second disappointing thing is Delkin Support, which stopped responding to me after I showed them that their driver has compatibility issue. They never replied to any of my next mails."
4,One of the hottest new rock groups out there today.,"The album ""Superjaded"" by Liars, Inc. contains an awesome rock sound that has been missing in the music industry for quite some time now. They put the ""rock"" in rock and roll. It's hard to find an album with more than a couple good songs these days, but I sure did find one when I bought this CD. This is a great debut album and I am sure they are going to take everyone by surprise and move themelves to the top of the charts."
5,Excellent Reference Book,"I had a problem with a former tenant but did not want the expense of an attorney. I bought the book, followed the steps, and we settled before having to go back to Court."
5,best courtroom advice,"This book provides the best courtroom advice of all the new york self-help books that are on the shelves or online. It is simple, to the point, and very complete. I saw the other online reviews and took a chance; it is a great reference book. I have actually seen people in small claims court bring this book with them as a reference (pretty smart!)"
3,This book was o.k.,"But a but disappointing considering all rave reviews I read prior to buying the book. It was basic and general information that I could have possibly received from online websites. If you are clueless about the process and are not internet savy, then it is a great book for you. It gives you the basic foundation."
3,very New York City-centric,"I found the book far too geared for NYC although the sales pitch refers to all courts and in particular, Suffolk County which is the area I was interested most in. While it does supply certain basics, it lacks depth in many areas and in most suburban courts."
5,If you love country music you have to see this!!!!,When I first started listening to country music I was introduced to this video. After seeing it for the first time I had to watch it over and over. Garth Brooks is the best performer. He's really energetic and very entertaining. Watching this will make you want to get up and dance. Garth really knows how to put on a great concert. If you love Garth Brooks you have to buy this video.
5,Daddy's little helper,Hey if your son is like mine anytime you pick up a hammer or screwdriver or what have you so does he. And this tool set is a wonderful toy which you can use to prpare your children on how to use the real thing and not have to worry about what or who he is going to use it on next
4,Good toy for the price,"I got this toy for my 19 month old son for Christmas. He can't totally use all the tools, but he likes putting the screwdriver in the screws and turning back and forth, and running the drill (though he's not coordinated enough to use that with the ""wood"" piece. And he likes playing with the pliers and hammer. If he was too much younger, he'd probably only get use out of the hammer. But he can do something with pretty much all the tools except the wrench.The tools are plastic, and we haven't owned it long enough to know how durable they will turn out. But so far it's been a lot of fun for him!"
1,"Looks good, but cheap and poor quality","This is the first review I've written in a while - really disappointed in the quality of this (even at the low price). Everything is presented very nicely in the case. Within 30 minutes of using, the drill broke -- its motor still runs, but it no longer turns the bit. The work belt has a completely ineffective buckle. The buckle releases as soon as my 3 year old son starts to move around while wearing it - and that's with no tools attached to the belt. The rest of the non-mechanical pieces are fine and realistic looking enough for a little kid. Fortunately, it's hard to mess up with a simple plastic mold. As long as your expectations are along the lines of this review, if shelling out a few bucks for a suite of tools to engage in imaginative play is what you basically want -- this would be okay."
1,Do Not Buy,"This toy was a huge disappointment. It is poorly made. As other reviews note, the tool belt does not work well at all. The only way it will stay on is if you feed the belt through belt loops on your childs pants. The clasp won't stay in the plastic belt at all. When we got the toolbox, the pliers broke into two halves immediately, although we snapped them back together. My son cried the first time he used it because he got so frustrated with the belt and when he tried to use the pliers after we put it back together it broke again. Today the measuring tape broke. It's very disappointing because of the poor quality and it really doesn't build much of anything. Save your money and get something else."
1,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed in this. The tools are cute enough, but theres basically nothing for the child to do with them. I bought this for my three year old great grand son for his birthday. My advice is save your money."
2,Tool broke after 1 day,I was disappointed by the quality of this set. The pliers broke after only 1 day. The tool belt we received does not close well so it cannot be worn. I would not purchase this again.
3,"Fun tools, cheap toolbelt","Our child loves the tool set. Especially the fact that you can use the screwdriver or drill to put the screws into the piece of wood. They also go together with the bolts. Although the drill seems very cheap, it runs in both directions using a switch in the back and it's light enough for a child to carry in their tool belt easily. The tool belt is just a molded piece of plastic with a few posts and holes to hold it together. As the posts are perfectly straight, it is never going to hold together. It's also sized closer to the waist of a 6-7yo. Tried to get a nice kid's tool belt to replace this one, but it was on back order. Went to a chain home improvement store and got an apron with pockets for under a dollar that would tie around almost any kid's waist. Problem solved."
1,very cheap,I bought this for my grandson because he is already getting in to my toolbox.The tool belt with this kit is unuseable. That was the main reason I bought it.The rest of the tools could be bought at the Dollar store along with a box foranother dollar. Don't waste your money on this.
4,A Great Toy Set for Young Builders,I bought this toy as a gift for a little boy who loves to watch his father work with tools. These resemble his Dad's and he absolutely loves them. The majority of them have held up really well over the past few months. The only warning I would give is that the toy comes with a few plastic screws that his parents took away because they are a choking hazard- I would recommend you do the same if the toy is for a younger child. All in all an excellent toy that is likely to become a favorite.
4,Perfect for your toddler,I bought this for my daughter for her 2nd Birthday. She is always picking up her daddy's tools and pretending to use them. She loved it. The drill gun especially. The other reviews are right when they say the belt stinks. The plastic is too hard and it's doesn't adjust small enough for her.
3,Ok toy but very flimsy,I'm glad I got a deal on this toy. It is not worth the full price. Very flimsy and the workbelt dosen't even close.My kids played exactly 5 min with it. After that they lost interest since all the tool are really useless.
3,Little Disappointed,"The tools are not the best quality. The pliers broke the first time our son played with them, the drill bit does not stay in the drill and the tool belt is too big for our 3 year old to wear. However, the pretend wood piece is pretty neat. It actually looks like you are cutting wood or drilling a hole. The caring case is convenient."
3,Need instructions,"This is a nice set of tools for kids, but it didnt tell you what the holes on the board are for. Took a little while but I did figure it out.1) The saw is obvious2) The 4 holes that can be filed with black are for the electric drill. Its cool to see that you are drilling through.3)those two black peices are suppose to be nails so use the holes that are second fron the side.4) the last 2 holes on the left or right depending on which side you are looking (does not turn black) are for the nut and screws.Good luck and enjoy"
1,Simply awful,This is the worst Christmas album I've ever heard. Cheese synthesizer music -- nothing to do with swing. Buy something else.
1,get rid of big b....quick,"I just want to say that this cd is a big time disappointment. They need to get back to the original lineup and get rid of that horrible rapper big b. I love subnoize records, but they seem to be spreading themselves a little thin with their newer productions."
1,absolutley sucked,"I loved OPM's first album ""menace to sobriety"" so my friend gave me this for my birthday. I put it in the stereo so we could jam, but the ONLY song worth listening to was ""rollin"" wich gets old after 5 listens, I do not recomend this to ANYONE."
2,wonderful piano but poor sound,"Jarrett and Dejohnette are in top form here. the complaint I have is the poor sound quality. This is evident mostly with Peacocks bass. I always listen with quality headphones and the bass sounds terrible. There is a very evident ""Tinny"" sound throughout. It sounds like a loose string on an electric guitar. This just simply ruined this album for me."
4,"Very interesting, not my favourite though","Keith Jarrett never stops. He always experiments, he is always in search...Here`s what he has found :)"
5,"Oh, yes!","I have bought most of Jarrett's 'standards trio' recordings and enjoy them all. I must admit, however, that the pieces I really love are the 'extensions' that they get into every now and then.This is 49 mins of four such pieces recorded at various concerts in 1987 - and they are great! By the way, this disc was released in 1989; the distributor is playing delete/reissue games.It's pretty simple, if you love things like 'The Fire Within' or 'Desert Sun' (Blue Note box) or 'Caribbean Sky' (Tokyo '96) then BUY this!"
5,Sparkling interactive improvisation,"This is a marvelous CD. Jarrett's trio is sympathetic, brilliant, and inspiring. I saw his trio recently in Chicago, and they are incredible live. Maybe that's what helps make this CD so great, as it is culled from different live concerts in 1987. It is trance music, spiritual music, deeply moving and timeless. I highly recommend it. I think the trio format is a better fit for Jarrett than his solo work, which in my opinion tends to be too discursive, or rambling, as he searches for improvisational ideas. I do like the Koln concert, however."
4,"very calm,quiet for a meditation","A very calm music, invites you for a meditation, for a inner voyage.The pianist has a complete control of the piano and fingers and emotion...He, himself make a voyage through improvisations...To the one that likes a music that ask for a concentration, a total abandon....Very good !"
5,"Fun, learning toy","I purchased one of these several years ago for my granddaughter and she still plays with it, matching the shapes and making cupcakes. Her Daddy said she or her little sister play with it just about every day. So it was a ""no-brainer"" when it came time to pick out something for my 3 yr. old great niece. I hope she loves it just as much as my granddaughters do."
3,Just OK,"I was definitely more excited about this toy than my 2.5 year old daughter. I do think it has a lot of educational value as far as learning shapes go. Unfortunately, they are a little difficult to pull apart and my daughter has lost interest quickly."
3,"Great toy, but stinky smell!","My two year old loves this toy, but I can't stand the strong mothball smell. Printing on box recommends washing before use. I soaked and ran all parts in dishwasher. Still smells."
4,i like these and the kids love them,My kids play with these all the time at daycare...they are a good size for little hands and easy to handle
4,So cute!,"Exactly what I hoped. Bright colors, look like real cupcakes...I think my friend's little girl are going to love these!"
1,I dont get it...,why this toy has so many stars?? it smells like a vinyl and after 2 weeks of playing with it 2 cupcakes are already broken (top of the cupcake separates from the bottom which makes it impossible to play with) it is going back!
3,Cute as play food!,"My two year old daughter discovered a set of these at church and talked about them all week! She can easily play pretend with these cupcakes for an hour at a time and has gotten a lot of enjoyment from them since she got her own set. They're very durable and I feel like she and her little sister will get years of pretend play from them. So why a three star review?These cupcakes are marketed as educational toys for their shape sorting qualities- and priced accordingly. The problem is they were very difficult even for me to pry apart, much less for my daughter to pull apart. The set we received is useless as a shape sorter and as just play food I think they're a little overpriced.I would still get them just based on how much my daughter loves them, but be aware if you're getting them for their shape sorting qualities that they're very difficult for a young child to pull apart."
5,My girls love these (ages 2 & 3),"My two girls ages 2 & 3 both love playing with these. They are durable, and educational. I would highly recommend these, and actually chose these over M&D dessert toy simply because they offer more ways to play and learn, also they are less likely to hurt each other with these (in case one decides to fling one across the room) because they are made of a hard rubber, instead of solid wood. Great buy!"
3,Ugh!,"I got these cup cakes for my daughters birthday. My niece and nephew have and love the toy, however they have a better looking product than what I recieved. The cup cakes aren't fully painted. One half looks delicious while the other side of the same cup cake is white. This is so frustrating! I will not buy any more Smart Snacks on Amazon, Target from now on. They do smell horrible, but the package does say to wash before use. I am so frustrated!"
3,State divided,"It is a good map resource, but being large scale, the states are in sections on different pages making it difficult to visualize a route that crosses several pages."
3,Flaw discovered,I used this atlas as a back-up to my GPS on a rare recent road trip. Unfortunately I found that at least 2 pages did not overlap which left a gap in my route. I hope this isn't a consistent problem.
4,Rand McNally Large Scale Road Atlas,We received the road atlas soon after we ordered it. The large scale maps are very easy to read and so far we are very pleased with it. We are using this atlas in our RV and find it very easy to store behind our seats.
2,Not a good binding for an atlas,"I can certainly appreciate that this atlas is ideal for those whose eyes have issues with the small print of the standard type atlases. However, a big drawback for me is the binding of this atlas.I have found similarly bound atlases to split along the spine quite easily. Spiral binding, or even staple binding, are better choices. Especially for those of us who like the ability of opening an atlas to lay flat."
2,Large book,"Very large book. It is a bit difficult to use in a car due to its size. The maps are decent, but I would use it more as a reference item to keep in your house than as a travel guide you take with you in your vehicle."
2,Not Easy to Handle,"Although the atlas is large scale as promised, it is bulky and too much like a book to use in the car. It has a glued binding instead of the familiar spiral binding. That makes it nearly impossible to use in the car. Also the states are divided awkwardly and difficult to reconcile moving from one page to other half of the state on another page. Cities at the division are not repeated on the next map, so you need to find highways or follow guide marks to make the transition. It is not a good visual stimulus to follow. I put the atlas on a book shelf and bought another spiral bound atlas which is much more car friendly to use on trips."
4,Larger but not by much,"I like the larger format and the spiral binding but was hoping for a bit more of an increase in magnification. Overall though, I'm happy with the map."
2,Tears easily,"The print is still smaller than expected and the paper tears easily. Yet, it got me where I was going. Good price, but be gentle with it."
4,Would buy it again,"I like the spiral binding the gutter gap not withstanding. Since I usually use a computer map program or Internet tool to plan trips and work out details, my main interest in a road atlas is for a reference if needed. I like the larger pages, however, I find that the enlargements are not done consistently. At least one state is spread over four pages while other states may only have one page with a distinct difference in the amount of enlargement done for ""popular"" states. I can live with that and quite happy with the price and quality mix."
1,Disappointed,"What a disappointment. California is so chopped up, it is unusable. Even Arizona is excessively chopped up and is not even connected to a Mexican map - how useful is that if you live in Arizona? Most people want a road atlas for long distance travel planning and use in the car. This one is organized for people who don't know their way around their own locale. I'm sure all the information is usable at some point, but you would likely have a traffic accident trying to follow these maps in the car and it would be no fun at all sitting and planning a long trip with these disjointed maps. The most usable map is the large US map at the front - but I could have gotten that for free anywhere. Don't buy this atlas unless you've seen it in advance. I looked for a Rand McNally Western States Atlas - maybe they could do a better job with fewer states - nope - they don't have it."
5,Great Atlas for Anyone,I purchased this atlas for my wife who has problems with her vision. She loves it and I must admit it is much easier to look for places for me as well. The cities within the states are also easier to look at. I wish they could put these maps on one page but that is a tiny price to pay for the great size of each map.Highly recommend for anyone.
5,Maps are better,"Give me maps over GPS' any day. This Rand McNally large scale is the best!! Easy to follow all the roadways, plus the spiral binding makes page turning great. This is our second large scale, we wore out the first one."
3,Missing Canada and Mexico,"unlike most road atlases, this is USA only. I agree with other reviewers that there should at least be some overlap of maps on the edges as it is difficult to follow from one map to another. Plastic ring binding might not have been the best choice for something that may sit in a vehicle during the winter, and the covers ought to be a bit more durable or laminated as just from leafing through the atlas the covers have already started to fold where one's fingers grip while thumbing through to find the appropriate page. Beyond that, it seems to be an adequate atlas and larger scale is appreciated, though don't expect any comparison to a delorme state atlas in detail."
2,diappointed in the condition of the book,"The book was what I wanted and expected, but the condition in which the book was in was very bad. When I recieved it the top right corner of the cover was badly bent. There were also some other folds on the front and back cover. I was giving this as a gift and was not happy with the product that I recieved!"
2,Obsolete and almost racist,"This book may have been a pleasant read when it appeared in the mid 70's, but today, it is definitely unsavory. The attitude of Mr. Theroux toward non-americans is that of a visitor at a zoo. Toward women, it is somewhat worse. The info. on the trains is poor. I read the book to daydream of a trip to Burma, and I hope the country would be more interesting than what Mr. Theroux described 25 years ago."
3,Less than I expected,"Despite it's previous bestseller status, I found this book to be quite slow and it didn't grab my concentration. Theroux traveled by train from England to Turkey, India, Singapore, Japan, several other countries, and back across the whole of Russia. The tone is rather arrogant and I was disappointed that most of his time seemed to be actually spent on the train, rather than in the places he traveled to. Reading about his many train companions and the train staff was not as interesting as hearing about the people on the street he spoke with. I found the chapter on Vietnam interesting, but his trip home across Russia found him horribly depressed, and his negative attitude clouded the details of an experience that so many others have recorded as marvelous."
4,My second one,"This is my second M2. The first one I owned developed 4 cracks near the outer edge of the bowl. The cracks ranged from 1/2"" to 1-1/2"" long. They began to appear after about four years of semi monthly use. First one crack appeared, then two, etc. The cracks got longer with time so I knew it was a matter of time before the bowl would split and dump the media on the floor.I like the quietness of the unit and the fact that it produced very shiny brassDespite the failure I ordered a new M2 just like it. The new one has a high quality switch in the electrical cord - very handy feature. I'll be sending in the 2 year warranty card on the new one."
1,Terribly Disappointed,"After barely 12 months of use, the plastic bowl of this unit split open and is useless. The unit was not used excessively. Between 300 to 500 rounds of handgun brass was run through it about once every other week. Yet after less than 26 uses it failed.I spent the money (pre-paid return shipping as well) to send the tumbler to Hornady for factory warranty repair and received even more disappointment. 3 weeks after receiving it Hornady was unable to give me any idea as to when they would be repairing it.So now I'm out the tumbler due to a design/construction flaw as well as money for shipping it to and from Hornady's customer service.I will think long and hard before I buy anything from Hornady in the future!"
1,"Worked well, but bowl is cracking now!","I bought this tumbler after looking for some time at several other units and thought that the heavier bowl would last... was I wrong! In the less than 6 months I've had it, the bowl already has several large cracks in it and after reading another review here, this seems to be a problem with this particular unit.I never overload the bowl and only use walnut media with a little flitz media polish added to it and it's developed several cracks on the outside of the bowl. So far they have not gone all the way through to the inside, but they are fairly deep so it's just a matter of time until they do.This tumbler is nice and quiet compared to a couple of others I've tried, but if it's going to be breaking bowls, I'll have to start looking elsewhere. Do yourself a favor and look for something with better longevity!"
3,Almost an exact replacement of my old RCBS,"This case cleaner appears to be of the same design (but cheaper made) as my old RCBS tumbler I purchased back in 1985.The top (case holder) is basically the same being made of tough plastic.The bottom of the Hornady is plastic. (don't think much about plastic for long turm durability)The bottom also is completely open which will let dust and dirt in to the motor and fan, the RCBS was completely sealed with a fine material to trap dirt and dust but still allow for ventalation."
5,Great little polisher,"I've had mine for years now. The new ones look just the same -- why change what works. I will usually keep the same media in it until it breaks down enough that it gets annoying because they keep getting stuck in the primer hole. Every once in a while I will add some polishing compound. But it has been an absolute workhorse. It will run all day without any problems and the bowl still looks fine -- a few scratches, but nothing bad. It's about as noisy as any, I suppose. Not too bad but if was too quiet, I would forget to check on it every once in a while. All in all, definitely worth the investment."
4,De facto marketing bible,"De facto marketing biblePeople doing consulting for a living should read this book. The author calls out some myths around branding. The thought the company brand will help sustain a job is incorrect. New business will be won only to the extent that the client believes that the professional is interested, cares, and is trying to help.The author urges to compete for client relationships not projects.I liked the section on where the rubber meets the road covering the importance preparing and executing strategic precise road map for constant marketing is imperial. Guerrilla Marketing Is Cohesive and Coordinated.Word of caution: If you aren't going to make a case for profound, dramatic superiority, NEVER advertise!"
5,High quality cabinet,"We were looking for an enclosed cabinet for our electronics because we have a 9 month old son and we needed to hide components from him. Our house is full of a mahogany/red cherry wood, and I could not find a cabinet that matched those colors. The walnut matches beautifully. The ability to mix and match difference accessories makes this cabinet amazing. The Synergy series are pricey, but thats because its one of the highest quality cabinets i've seen. Its definitely not one of those cheap slap together desk/tables/cabinets you get from Staples, Walmart, or Target. Its solid and heavy and looks great, highly recommended!"
3,Not a collector's item,The overall perfomances of Mr. Gaye were execellent. The presentation of the film is very poor. I was very dissappointed in the production of such a brilliant man.
1,"More Frenchies, s'il vous plait","I was disappointed in this book when finding out that only about the first 1/4 actually contained info specific to French bulldogs; the rest was just generic dog info and worse yet, seemed to be a 'plug' for a brand of dog chew toys. It reeked of being a ""dog book"" template -- switching out the breed info on a few pages, adding a new cover, some photos, and voila! The reinforced binding may be sturdy, but it makes it very hard to hold or keep open. Best aspects were some adorable Frenchie photos, but even those were outnumbered by cartoonish drawings and photos of other breeds! Sacre bleu!"
1,Dog book in disguise,"I purchased this book wanting information regarding french bulldogs prior to getting a new pet. After meeting with breeders and reading information from them, this book is in no way adequate in informing potential owners of this rare breed. It also cost me a lot more than $4.99, try Australian $29.00, money not well spent.The book is mostly regarding dog care which can be obtained in vast quantities from other sources."
4,Great Text but CD doesn't work,This text is great but the CD that comes with it does not load the PHStat onto my computer. Don't know why though.
1,terrible,Never got the damn book!! I would rate it zero stars if it would let me. I canceled my fisrt order and ordered a second one and was charged both times and never got one book.
1,False description,"The description didn't specify what edition. Thought this was the 11th edition by the date, but when it showed up - 9th edition. Will not use this site for textbooks again. MUST SPECIFY EDITION!"
4,"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Number 3)",I liked the book the different short stories were fun to read. The books in this series add a nice depth to the main story that David Weber writes about Honor Harrington. I recommend reading the books in the World of Honor series.
1,"Haven't read this book yet, BUT","Reading someone elses review here, I have the following question..Is there going to BE a sequel to Ashes? Anyone knows please let me know at twilight@snowhill.comThanks tons! PS I can see Honor eventually becoming Queen herself... it seems inevitable and I would love to see the series come out with enough books to make that a possibility.."
5,Wonderful Christmas Music,This CD is wonderful Christmas music. It is well done! I liked it so much I bought two!
3,"Synthie-Pop, with a ""Twist"" of Goth...","Xymox is light enough to please synth-pop fans, and dark enough to be somewhat gothic. Overall pretty unique style, with a cool mix of sounds and tempos. Deep vocals and angst filled lyricism add to the ambience.Some of my favorites: ""Evelyn""/""Obsession""/""Craving""/""The River.""Worth checking out: De/Vision, Distain, B-Machine!"
2,Not As Good As Others,"I own Phoenix and Metamorphosis which, personally, I like better than Twist of Shadows. Just goes to show individuality trumps mass appeal. Twist of Shadows is a tad boring IMO. I've listened to it several times and it has not grown on me yet. I hope it does. SEW."
3,A bit disappointed,"I am a military spouse and will be moving to Britain soon. I was hoping this book would have more ""meat"" on living in England, what to expect, things that would be useful to know, their culture,etc... This book is great if you are moving to Britain and need to learn about medical insurance, doctors, vets, taxes, dentists, immigration, postal services, education, etc..."
5,This is not a complete compendium of moving to Britain but real close!,"Living and Working in Britain: A Survival Handbook I found this to be an excellent starter book on relocating to England. It will help lay the foundation of knowledge, on which you can expand; by further, more focused study to find out what you need to know and is a move to Great Britain worth pursuing. It is easy to understand and has a very good writing style. It will more than get you started. A good read, a good buy, a good book!"
4,Review of the 2nd edition,"I am a reader of the 2nd edition of this book, as I have not got the 3rd edition that , sorry, just give you some comment to the 2nd edition. I believe, however, you can glean how good the 2nd edition is. Firstly, it give some hits of writing a cover, or , what essential information should be given i your cover letter. For instance, you should tell the potential employer whet you are available to attend the intervew. Secondly, What visas/permits would you be necessary to got. Thirdly, after arrival, the first stuff you have to do is how to fight with "" Customs Not only those information, it also drops the hints down, say, the issue of accommodation, public transport, insure , etc.. Indeed, I highly recommend this book to whom want to work in the UK."
2,Evil Debts,"The story was medicore (at best) and got to be very predictable. I actually purchased this book based on the reviews that I saw on this site and wanted to give an accurate description of this book before anyone else was duped into the purchase.P.S. This book has typos, mispelling, bad punctuation and is in desperate need of an editor.Updated in Response to Wendy's comments:""...then he wasn't paying attention to the plot and the intricacies of the characters in the book......""Or maybe it is just because I have a functional brain and Common Sense""...Try reading the book again Jason- you missed the point!...""Not even if your life depended on it"
5,Great workout for your upper body,"He does things with the ball I would never have thought of. There is quite a bit of pushups and balancing on your hands with the ball under your feet. He uses 2 balls in exercise 2, but you can do it with one. I think it's a great workout and I hope I get results."
4,"more mature than the debut album,","this album is more evolved & I think, better crafted than the first album, maybe the first was too commercial, the second one somehow seems to contain much more lyrical content & maturity.yet still retains the characteristic/individualistic style.some of my fave aae tracks are here: but I think the one i go back to the most is ""pearl fishermen"" as it is altogether just so beautiful & i love the harmonies."
5,Doesn't tangle up on itself.,"Works great, is easy to roll up and doesn't stick to itself and tangle up. What more do you want in a cord? Hasn't shorted yet, although I don't use it frequently."
4,terrific songs in the softer and louder senses.,"I was younger when this album came out.I had lost the cassette and when I went to buy it again I just couldn't find it anywhere.It's musical style of softer,""within your eyes"" to louder,""bang"" and having a little of their cultural sound added makes ""my generation ""that much better to me.Thank you Amazon for having this cd.To me it is still one of the greats."
5,Absolutely amazing.,"After I heard this album for the first time I was addicted to Gorky Park. I love all the songs on the album,specially track no. 2. They did a great job when the wrote/recorded that song."
5,Sad for You if You Missed this One,"This Album by Gorky Park is one of the best almums I have ever listened to; if you have never heard the songs on this album, and if you like hard rock or even if you just have an ear for good music, then I truely feel sorry for you."
5,Excellent,This is a fantastic album for someone who enjoys older hard rock/heavy metal music. It would make a great gift for a rocker who has almost everything or a great addition to any heavy metal fan's music collection. Amazingly enough people seem to have forgotten about this great group!!
2,It was supposed to be Billy Joel!!!!,This band visited my high school back in 1990. They seemed like nice guys but then again nice doesn't mean good. Look at the band Lifer. I met them at their release party and they were cool guys. Problem was the music was terrible. Same thing with Gorky Park. Maybe it was the fact we all thought we were going to see Billy Joel but instead we get.....GORKY PARK?? It's a moment I can reflect back on and laugh when I am awake but when I sleep at night I toss and turn with Bang playing in my nightmares endlessly. I then wake up in a cold sweat. I can understand and respect that every other review on here loves the album but I can honestly say I did not like the album at all. I remember when I received this CD as a gag gift. Within a year I threw it away.
3,Limited Space,Purchase this for my daughter for her tiny living space where storage is severely limited. Sturdy when open and easy to store when closed. Difficult to get clean becasue of the pleats.
1,ECOBREW is MUCH MUCH better!,"I used this for 2 months when it stopped working, came back here to find reviews saying you have to buy a new one every 2-3 months depending on usage. Not a problem.. but I got the ecobrew version as a gift. I LOVE IT! The coffee is much stronger (using the same dunkin donuts brand coffee) and tastes much better! I've also had it 3 months now....still don't have to replace it. (Same if not more usage)."
1,"Worthess, overpriced product, does not work. BIG MESS!","Like many others said, leaks water everywhere. Coffee grounds in your cup too. Got it at walmart yesterday. I'm going to return it and tell them it does not work (which is the Truth!)and not to put it back on the shelf again for the next person to buy. Complete engineering failure by Keurig! What a disappointment!"
3,Weak cup of coffee,"I wish the re-usable Keurig filter produced a stronger cup of coffee- it seems like the disposable coffee containers are about the same size, so I dont know why there is such a difference!"
5,K Cup reusable coffee filtet,"I would like it if I could remove the one that is already in the brewer. I try so hard to remove it so I can use the reusable filter for my own coffee but it won't budge and I am afraid of breaking it. If you know of an easy way to remove the one that came with the brewer, please let me know !"
5,really cool...,"My friend on Nantucket GT has one. This is really a great way to save $$$ if you drink a lot of coffee. So I bought this for my dad, it's easy for him to use and he likes the fact that he can use his own coffee. Buy one today!"
4,Great,Its not as easy as just buying the nice K cups BUT its a lot cheaper! It does the job it is intended to do just have to clean it after every use. Once again..not as easy as an expensive K cup that you just throw away after use but def cheaper. I use it.
4,K-Cup,"Excellent way to brew your own coffee, using your own selected coffee beans. The only complaint is if you are a heavy coffee drinker, multiple use is required and cleaning before each use can be tedious. My solution, use two, this cuts the work in half."
3,Nice idea if it lasted,"Bought it for my Mom along with the coffee maker thinking she could use her own fresh ground coffee rather than getting the pods- well, the thing did not last very long- the plastic broke after a while; now she uses the pods - much simpler"
2,No instructions,No Instructions on how full container should be OR what grind to use. Should you totally or partially fill the filter? Please advise!!
5,Saves money and does a good job,"I've been using the reusable k-cup every day since Christmas. Unlike some reviewers here I use it with the Mr Coffee Keurig Brewer since I do not own the Keurig coffee brewer. The reusable filter is easy to use. I have not experienced splashing like others have mentioned. I did notice a stronger cup with using fine grain coffee. I had trouble finding fine grain coffee or espresso for a decent price, but finally found Cafe Bustelo. It's a good quality, fine grain espresso for a cheap price! Check the reviews & you'll see it has between 4 1/2 to 5 star review average. I highly recommend it."
1,"Didnt like it - hard to use, clean etc..","The hassle with taking out the normal cup holder, and putting this one in was annoying. Also the top of it cracked and the lid didnt seal. I bought a Ekobrew Cup which fitted straight into the Keurig, easier to use, clean etc.."
4,good enough,"This filter pays for itself right away if you drink alot of coffee, but it makes a much weaker, less flavorful cup of coffee than the k-cups do. Still a good purchase overall."
4,great for saving money and larger coffee cups,"I have not had any of the leaking problems mentioned in the reviews, and we have used this very often in the last two weeks.(several times daily). I guess Keurig did the gasket fix needed. I was disappointed the pre-made k-cups could not make a strong cup of coffee if I wanted a large cup. However, I can fill this filter up with a favorite coffee, and use the larger cup sizes. It is a bit messy to rinse and clean, but since I do it right after using, it is not difficult. This is a much more economical way to use my new Keurig. Definitely recommend."
1,If it worked,"I have attempted to use this product about 10 times with no luck. I cannot get a cup of coffee that isn't severely watered down. I've tried all different degrees of grind, different types of coffee, different amounts in the cup. I can't get it to work. I really am not technologically challenged and I feel like I should be capable of using this product the correct way. I can't get anything that tastes like coffee should out of it. I am very frustrated because I love my Keurig brewer but I hate throwing away so much plastic. I really wish that it worked."
4,"good, but messy","I like this, but it's a bit messy. I prefer the k-cups and choosing any kind they sell each day. I suppose when the novelty of the k-cups wears off, I will use it more. For now, my new ""toy,"" the Keurig coffee maker, is GREAT!!!!and I love the K-cups!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I was really excited at the prospect of being able to brew my own coffee in the Keurig brewer and couldn't wait for this item to be delivered. Maybe I had set myself up by having such high expectations.When I brewed my first cup of coffee, I was so dissapointed. A lot of the grounds had been pulverized by the wire basket and ended up in my cup making the coffee undinkable for my tastes. I am so used to my paper filter coffee maker I guess.I tried cutting a paper filter down to size and sticking it in the wire basket. While it gave me better results, it wasn't good enough to be satisfactory and having to do the extra work takes away from the Jeurig convenience.I would say that this product is most likely good or even great for some, but not for me. I now use the K-Cup coffees. It is much easier and tastes a lot better as no grounds are getting into the cup."
3,mcb,It is a holder and it does fit the machine.But mine overflows water around the top and the coffee tastes better out of a regular drip machine.Cleanup is easy but not as easy as the k-cups themselves.The need to redesign to with a rubber type seal at the top. so the point pushes through and does not allow the water to leak out. The steam like pressure would work better as well.mark
3,Too messy,"This product was very easy to use - not sure why others have had trouble getting it into the machine. However, like other foil filters I have tried in the past, it let some grounds through which make for a nasty last sip or two. Plus, cleaning up is a pain - the wife did not like all the grounds going into the sink. I'm either going to have to live with the 40 cents per cup of the K-cups or get a different machine. I found a site where I can get a 24 pack of k-cups for less than $11 with free shipping. While the device functions exactly as advertised, it made making a cup of coffee a little more work than I was willing to do."
1,"Great Idea, bad product",I really thought it would be nice and cheaper to use a coffee of my choice but found out that the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter is messy and hard to clean. You have to change out a attachment on your machine to use this which is another inconvenience plus I always wind up with coffee grains in my cup and the coffee comes out weak. I like the idea but this gadget is not the answer.But as far as the Keurig coffee maker goes it is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
1,Great Idea but...,Yeah it is a great idea indeed. I am sure Keurig spent some time designing this product. What i don't understand it why they would not design one that is compatible with all Keurig machines! Obviously i have the one machine that makes this product useless. Oh well!
4,Coffee filter,"I purchase this coffee filter for my neighbor as a gift because her husband had given her the coffee maker. She had plenty of coffee that she could not use in it and this filter was just what she needed to use the loose coffee that she had. After a week of using it I asked her how it worked for her. Her reply was ""FANTASTIC."" Therefore, I leave it at that."
2,Poor Product,"I am very disappointed in this product. When making a cup of coffee the coffee is very weak. I noticed that when the coffee is brewing water is coming out the side of the filter which causes a weak cup of coffee. I have tried adding different amount of coffee to the filter basket but get the same results. I would avoid buying this product, hopefully someone will manufacture a product that works properly in the machine."
2,"Good idea, but horrible results.","I was excited to get this item so much so that I bought a few to give away as gifts and such. I wanted to be able to make Dunkin Donuts and some of my other favorites in the Kureg. Sadly after trying to use and like this filter, I have to admit is it garbage. Why you may ask??? Well others have stated it over and over, the design allows the water to flow through so fast all you have is a cup of pathetically weak coffee when it is done brewing. I see some reviewers have reported solving this problem by modifying a K-Cup or using filter material...... good idea, but I think it is pretty crazy that someone would make and sell this in its current form. Do they not even test their products functionality before selling it??? I can only recommend this for people who like super weak and watered down coffee. Bold coffee lovers need not apply."
1,Keurig needs to go back to the drawing board on this,"I love the Keurig coffeemaker and the convenience of the K-cups; however, I wanted to have the reusable filter as a backup if I ran out of K-cups. IT DOESN'T WORK! Coffee was too weak and not drinkable, and it made a mess when attempting to brew - water splattered all around the coffeemaker. I'm very disappointed and hope Keurig will redesign one that works."
2,Poorly made,"Fortunately, this was a freebie with my coffee maker. I would have been disappointed if I had purchased something that didn't work very well. It leaks water as it is brewing. I have not experimented with the grind (yet). An alternative that works is I re-use the k-cup. Remove the foil top, rinse it, add drip grind coffee,then mold a piece of aluminum foil on the top. I try to match the hole in the bottom with the coffee maker, but don't always get it lined up. Perfect cup every time. Cheers."
3,Cheap plastic takes away the joy.,"I have had my Keurig since the holidays and everyone in the house loves it. We use the reuseable filter every morning as the waste produced by the cups was weighing on our minds. I am ordering my second reuseable filter because the plastic that is around the rim, and helps lock the top on, started to break off as soon as we got it and has broken off completely. I am hoping that the second one is sturdier than the first and we will not have any more spill overs and burned fingers.I love the concept of the filter and the speed of the brewer, let's see what happens next."
4,It's okay. A nice back up for the real thing.,"The reusable k-cup is okay when you run out of the real k-cup coffee pack to make coffee with your own coffee ground that you have at home. It is a little time consuming to take apart of the unit to replace it with the reusable k-cup in your coffee maker. In addition, it can get messy considering trying to put coffee grounds into the reusable k-cup and you have to wash it. I would not use this daily to make my coffee, but it is a nice back up if you should run out of the real k-cup coffee."
2,Substandard design.... on purpose.,Keurig has a reputation for excellent products but this is an example of purposely creating a substandard product in order to keep people buying the brand-name K-cups. No additional rubber seal on the top ensures a watery mess in the end. The lack of pressure in the K-cup causes the coffee to be weaker also.Keurig has purposely created this lousy product so we get tired of the messes and keep buying the $13 boxes of brand-name K-cups.Can't any third-party company come up with a decently sealed reusable K-cup filter? This is junk.
1,Not Worth The Trouble,"I was really hoping that this would work. I love my Keurig, but at .50 cents or more a cup, I was willing to try a re-usable coffee pod. I even bought the paper liners to use to keep clean up easy. What a disappointment :-( First, it's hard to tell how much coffee to add. Either the coffee is too strong or too weak, but the biggest problem is the grounds! Lots of grounds in my coffee. I'm returning it. Save your time and your money."
1,waste of money,The K-Cup never fails to leak coffee grounds into my cup of joe. I end up buying coffee from a shop almost every morning !
2,"weak coffee, dribbles and drips","This doesn't work well with my ""Elite"" Keurig Brewer. The coffee is relatively weak and the force of the water must overflow this filter so water spits out around it. I'm going to give the Ekobrew a try because it is better rated and you don't have to remove the inner sleeve to make it fit."
1,"Sorry product, glad I didn't buy it.","This is a pain to use and always leaks. I have taken time to make sure that it sealed without coffee grinds on the lip, tried fine, coarse and medium types of grinds and nothing worked correctly. Water leaks all outside the cup, coffee seeps into cup and clean up in a rush is not an option.I do not recommend buying using or giving this product to anyone. It ruins the whole idea behind having single cup coffee maker in the first place, which is fast, convenient, cost saving coffee making without the waste, roflmao. What a waste!"
3,Gray K-Cup Leak Home Depot Solution,I bought a B60 and the grey K-cup leaked badly. We read the posts and settled with this perfectly fitting washer from Home Depot. We tried it and vola. We are disappointed with a $160 coffee maker and a $1.67 pack of washers to fix a design flaw. We are not going to rip people off by bagging them in twos and hocking on e-bay. We want to share our find. Make sure you all register the product with the company and save your receipt in case of a recall or someone gets burned and starts a class-action lawsuit.[...]
3,"Saves money, but breaks easily","I love that I can put my own coffee grounds in this reusable filter/cup, however it's very frustrating that the plastic around the top breaks off so easily. I'm careful to remove any grounds around the rim and yet I have to buy a new filter about every 3-4 months. I wish there was an alternative that lasted longer."
2,Reusable filter makes weak coffee every time,"The reusable filter was the feature that sold me on the Keurig K-cup machine. I love the coffees available in K-cups, but like my own coffees at times too.The filter brews are never at normal strength because the stream of water passes thru the grounds so fast it doesn't allow for the flavor to accrue. I'v tried all grind options, but noithing works. Have any users found the solution?"
5,Helps me save money on Tea!,"I have cut my tea costs to less than five cents per cup with this filter insert.Simply use a single cup teabag (or two for stronger brew) in this filter insert. I now buy teabags in bulk instead of k-cups which are sometimes difficult to find, especially in basic tea flavors. Works great for Lipton and other basic blends as well as some of the more fun flavors."
1,Extremely poor design,"Every review here includes a ""fix"" to get this product to work. This should not have made it out of product development. No reviewer should give 3-5 stars for a product that needs a fix to get it to work. Good concepts poorly executed do not deserve stars.Out of the box, this filter will deliver very weak coffee (even on the strong setting) AND will leave a big mess of coffee grounds and water in and around your machine. Keurig should recall this product as it simply doesn't work without a fix. Don't buy it. It is not worth the hassle or the mess."
4,Specific Grind Needed,"After hearing alot of negative reviews about this item, I was hesitent to try it. Well, I did....but you have to make sure to use the right grind of coffee. How do I know this...well I can thank Gloria Jeans Coffee Company. When you order from their website, they specifically tell you if you are ordering to use in the Keurig My K-Cup, make sure you get FRENCH PRESS GRIND. The auto-drip is too fine of a grind for the K-Cup.(Which most Coffee you buy already ground from the grocery store is Auto-Drip. Why did I give it 4 Stars...well as I love using this, its still not as covienent as the K-Cups, but it does save $$$."
1,Breaks in less than two months.,"This is actually a piece of junk. Mine lasted two months--and we only used it at weekends!! So it lasted for approximately 40 cups of coffee which equates to a cost of around 37 cents per cup ($14.95/40) on top of the cost of the coffee itself. Based on this, you're cheaper buying the k-cups.I've written to Keurig expressing my disgust at their worse-than-poor quality product--but, so far, no response is forthcoming.Update ( I should have done this a long time ago): Keurig did send me a replacement ""My K-Cup."" free of charge. However, it's still a piece of junk.I'm going to get a ""Pod Holster"" so I can try pods in my Keurig machine."
1,"Keurig My K-cup, poor design, doesn't last","I bought Keurig because you can use your own coffee but the My K-cups are poorly made. There isn't enough space between the lid and the lip to accommodate the rim of the filter insert. When you tighten the lid it puts stress on the thin plastic lip which eventually splinters and breaks off, once the splinters cut my hand as I was tightening the lid. The company sent me replacements advising me to not overtighten, but they all crack no matter how careful you are. If you don't tighten the lid enough, coffee grounds and water spray out making a mess in the machine and grounds in your coffee. The My-K cups aren't cheap either at $15 each. The company must be aware of the problem, don't know why they don't fix it."
3,Great concept,I love the idea of the reusable filter. The one complaint I have is that it leaks some of the grinds in the coffee. It also takes a bit more time to make. Overall I think it will be worthwhile because it should save a considerable amount of money to not buy k-cups.
2,Save your money............,Coffee needs to be ground extra fine in order to use one of these successfully. We found it to be a waste of money. just a pain in the butt to use and clean.
3,Reusable Coffee Filter for Keurig,"I like the ability to make other coffee in my Keurig, but this needs to come with multiple of the filter baskets as once you use the one filter it comes with, it's a pain to clean and dry for the next cup."
2,rateing keurig k-cup reusable coffee filter,cleanup is messy and difficult also at the end of filling a cup it squirts and spatter drink onto counter top.john carter
2,Only works on B130 after some light surgery,"Despite the comments at the top of the item description about compatible devices, out of the box, this WILL NOT work in the B130 brewer.Still, with a sharp knife, it is possible to get it to work by hacking/sanding off one of the locking tabs, so it will slip over the top of the cup-holder guide on the B130.For it to work, you'll need to (with a sharp pairing knife) remove both one of the 3 locking tabs at the top of the base cup, and one of the locking tabs inside the top unit, (and preferably no fingers in the process).Once you do that you'll need to always seal the filter bin in a way that lines up the missing locking tabs at both the bottom and the top (I made a mark with a marker to help), and it'll squeeze into the top of a B130 brewer.Regardless, the coffee coming out will be pretty darn weak."
3,B-E Very Careful with this,I think the use of the K-cup is how my husband broke his Kuerig. He tried to use it wrong and got the blue blinking light of death. I'm going to have to replace it for Christmas. I just wanted to warn others so they are careful with this handy little cup.
3,OK,"Although I liked this product, I don't use it as much as I thought I would. It's messy. The K-Cup are just so much easier and no clean up."
3,Price,"I haven't used the filter yet but I wanted you to all know it is $14.99 at both Target and Bed, Bath & Beyond and it is 12.99 at Walmart! Why pay $20 if you don't have to?"
3,It's okay,I've used it once or twice and the coffee has been a tad bit weak but it's nice to finally use whatever coffee I'm in the mood for without have to waste all the little plastic cups.
1,shipping,I ordered this along with a b60 machine and when I looked at my e-mail receipt I was charged 65$ for the shipping and handling of this one item. Huh? canceled that order fast. Buyer beware.
3,"Gets the job done, but needs to be improved.","I got the ""My k-cup"" with the hope that I could use my grinds with the maker, and not solely rely on k-cups. Sadly, it brews weakly, and it leaks water and grinds. So you have to use a bold or extra bold coffee, or only brew on the smallest setting to get some oomph out of medium to mild blends. Another downside to that is that the filter is extra hot after brewing, so you have to wait a bit to dump out the grinds (which, btw, are excellent for gardening- esp. roses) and brew some more.So for now I'm sticking with using the k-cups unless I have a bold brew on hand as far as grinds go."
3,K-Cup Reusable Filter,"Time consuming and messy, both swapping out unit and filling especially if in a hurry and not set up night before.Based on my own experience while trying to read instructions, set up unit, and get ready for work."
1,Don't waste you money.,"The principle behind this product is fantastic. Why spend all that money on K-Cups when you can just put ground coffee in the device and have your coffee at a fraction of the cost? Unfortunately, at least for me, it doesn't work. Water and coffee grounds sprayed all over the place. No matter how many times I adjusted the filter all that happened was I repeated the mess. I gave up and threw it away."
3,Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filterh,"It does a good job making a good cup of coffee,but it's three things more to clean, the holder,the basket and the lid,and when you are in a hurry it's just another ""thing"" to do. Less is more. But like I said , it's OK."
1,Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter,"SORRY, UNUSABLE ITEM, YOUR COFFEE CUP IS FULL OF GROUNDS, ALSO IS VERY INCONVENIANT HAVING TO REMOVE CUP HOLDER FROM MAKER"
1,makes coffee taste like metal,save your money and get a filter that doesn't make your coffee taste like metal. the metal wire filter just makes your coffee taste gross.
1,Cheap but watery,Yeah....I tried it. You have to remove part of your machine to use this and then the coffee is watery. Not worth the hassle. I have had friends recommend the ekobrew. Buying it now.
2,yucky coffee,"Used this filter to try brewing our own coffee in the Keurig. Thought it would be a good compromise because he only likes his Folgers' Simply Smooth, but I like lots of different flavors. Sadly, this was not what we hoped. The coffee brewed with the reusable filter tasted flat and somewhat bitter. There was no body at all. So it goes back."
5,Good purchase!,I have yet to use my reusable coffee filter but I am sure it works great. Anything in the Keurig family work really good.
2,POOR DESIGN,"The design of the water going down the middle and straight out the bottom leaves all the coffee on the sides dry and ""unused."" The coffee comes out tasting very weak, no matter how fine it's ground. This needs to be designed better."
1,I wish I could give it less than one star,"This was a great idea, but it didn't even fit into my machine. I searched for model numbers, but there wasn't any so I assumed it would be perfect. Then I read the reviews and found that most people had problems with this product, even if it did fit into the machine. Solocups are the solution, they fit into all machines and don't break apart after time. I would not waste my money on this piece of crap."
3,nice but Leaks!,"This is a nice feature, but it leaks as it isnt water tight.Disappointed and wondering if anyone out there found a way to pre-load these and make them not leak every time you use it?thoughts?"
1,Poor Design,"I bought a Keurig for X-mas 2010 and have loved having it. The ""My K-Cup"" that I bought with it is great idea but a flawed design. The typical problems arose with me that have been posted elsewhere with the leak problems and poor quality of the brew. The fixes I have seen are clever and do work to a degree, but they are just that, FIXES. I have not seen any movement from the company to fix the design problem (i.e. why not replace the solid bottom with filter material) and do not see the sense on giving this item a high rating just because I am able to use a workaround that works some of the time for some of the people.I agree with a post I have seen in the past that stated that we, as consumers, should not reward a flawed product with a high rating just because we heard of or were able to figure out a fix for it's bad design. The company needs honest feedback to be able to fix it."
3,Looks Good,Item arrived in good condition and appears practical but we haven't gotten around to using it yet.
3,Kind of a Hassle,"I like the idea of this gadget, since it saves so much money, but if you don't clean it each time, you'll have a mess on your hands. The coffee will back up and leak out all over the place. I think I'll go back to buying the k cups and drink less coffee!"
1,Oh no! It's a hold-up!,"Why in the world would anyone pay $47.95 for an item that can be purchased from most retailers for $14.99 (plus shipping, of course) or from Keurig themselves for $22 +/- including shipping! Even that is highway robbery! It's beyond me! I keep checking back every couple of days expecting it to be corrected."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I guess if you really want to save yourself some money and use less expensive coffee then is worth it. Although I do find it to be horribly messy , because once those grounds are wet they are tough to get out of the little filter basket. When I bought this item I figured that the newness of individual cups would wear off and I would want to go back to my old stand by coffee...I was wrong. The coffee from the K-Cups is just way more flavorful than my old brand.(And , again,I hate the clean up )"
1,Pass on the reusable coffee filter,"I normally do not give negative feedback, but the reusable coffee filter is a big disappointment. If the grounds are too small, they clog the filter making it difficult to clean; if the grounds are too big, you may as well pour hot water through rocks.If you're like I am, and like coffee with a little kick too it (or a lot of kick), then pay for the K Cups. My favorite is Green Mountain Dark Magic. A deep rich flavor, but not harsh."
2,My K Cup... just okay :(,"This is a poor design. No matter how little coffee I put in the My K Cup the coffee would leak out through the sides of the dispensing part of the Keurig during brewing. So I ended up with hot coffee puddled on the counter top every time. After investigating the cause, I found that the lid on the My K Cup just sits down too low leaving too much space between the brewer and the My K Cup. It just didn't seal good enough leaving room for leakage. I had to put a rubber ring under the My K Cup lid to keep it from going down so far in the reservoir. With the seal tighter between the brewer and the My K Cup it solved the leakage problem. I'm using it since there seems to be nothing better at the moment. Just be aware that it may need some Jerry-rigging."
1,Works Very Poorly,"This just doesn't work. Water spills all over the counter. What ends up in the cup is like dishwater, not coffee. The folks at Keurig aren't stupid; it isn't rocket science to make a reusable K-Cup. They're just trying to discourage people from using their own coffee, and use the pre-made K-Cups instead. Shame. Luckily, it's not too late for me to return my Keurig."
1,Incredibly Messy!,"Mind boggling how it makes an incredible mess regardless of how little or much coffee you put in it! No, it's not a matter of ""making sure the lid is closed all the way"". Imagine that! A reviewer suggested cutting a little round piece from a regular/plastic k-cup and adapting it so it fits on the bottom of the ""my"" k-cup, well...if you are willing to go through all that trouble (a) you just sacrificed the convenience of the system and made it really cumbersome (b) you just sacrificed the savings to yourself and/or the environment by having to keep on buying regular k-cups so you can use your ""my"" k-cup. A truly awful/messy product! BTW: just returned everything: the coffee maker and the ""my"" k-cup."
1,"Leaky, messy, nightmarish weak coffee making dismantlement.","Wow, I could not be more disappointed in how poorly this works. It leaks water all over the place and makes weak and unsatisfying coffee."
1,Worst product ever.....,I almost never review items but this one I had too. This item does not work at all. The only thing that it does is leak water out of the top because the water can drain fast enough. I tried it several as the directions stated and ended up with the same results.
3,It works after some fussing,"I would actually give this product 2.5 stars if I could. I really like my Keurig machine, but buying k-cups starts getting expensive after a while. I bought this product because I wanted to be able to grind my own coffee to save money and make a stronger cup of coffee. I was initially frustrated with the reusable coffee filter because every time I made coffee, water kept splashing everywhere and grinds would be all over the place. After reading other Amazon reviews, I discovered that the problem isn't really design of the K-Cup reusable coffee filter, but simply moving the gasket down a bit to seal the space between the Keurig and the filter. One other thing I noticed is that the filter makes better coffee if you grind your beans coarsely, versus a fine grind. At this point I will say that I'm pretty satisfied with the product, but the product documentation leaves some to be desired."
3,"Good product, until I discovered something better.","I love my Keurig brewer, and have tried pretty much most if not all of the reusable K-Cup product out on the market including the My K-Cup. I've been using the My K-Cup for the longest time since I can use my own favorite coffee, it has been a work horse for me with daily use.But I've recently discovered the Solofill Cup product, this product works better, it's easier to use and makes a much darker cup of coffee for me. Looks like someone built a better mouse trap."
2,Don't waste your money,"So you spend good money to have a great cup of coffee? I did. . . well, don't waste money buying the My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter because you'll end up with a very watered down version of the fabulous coffee you COULD be having. I spent $15 on this and used it about 3 times. I kept thinking I was doing something wrong until I started reading more reviews and I'm not the only one who hates this thing.I haven't found a perfect solution yet (I DID, however, reuse one of my kcups this morning by rinsing it out, filling with my own coffee and covering w/a small piece of foil. . . and it was VERY good!) I'll keep looking because I don't want to make more garbage by throwing away 3 or 4 kcups everyday but I WON'T be using the My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter."
2,Water all over the counter... there is a solution!!,"Okay, so I was extremely upset when I got my K-cup and ended up with water ALL OVER my counter. We took it back to the store and exchanged it for another, hoping the one we had was just faulty. Still no luck. This one also poured water all over our counter. Well, I finally called the help line on the instructions and they gave me a solution to the problem. All you need to do is look up under the lid where the pin is that punctures the top of the k-cups. There is a rubber gasket around that pin. CAREFULLY reach up and slide that gasket down a hair. Problem solved! If water still leaks out pull the gasket down a little more. We have had no more problems ever since. They really should print this in a troubleshooting part of the instructions; it would save many people a lot of grief. Hope this helps! I know I gave this 2 stars but now that the problem has been solved I give it 4."
2,Good idea but poor quality,"1) It allows use of your own coffee with a Keurig brewer.2) It is easy to clean.3) It is fairly easy to remove the original ""cup holder"" to use the reuseable MY K-Cup.4) It is better for the environment than single use plastic containers.5) It wears out very quickly, needing replacement or resorting to coffee purchased in single serving containers.I purchased two of these items and both have broken edges where the top piece screws onto the holder. Both started breaking within a month. Usage is based on about 4-5 cups per day. Buying coffee at a local coffee shop might have been cheaper."
3,Allows for some flexibility,Not sure the item is really necessary... it does allow you to use coffee not provided in a K-Cup (but I stopped counting after about 100 available varieties of K-Cups).
2,Defective lid,"I'm not impressed with this solution. The flange on the lid to the container started breaking off after several uses. There is hardly any plastic left to hold the lid on. That said, it doesn't seem to matter as the Keurig capsule clamps down on the lid holding it in place. Secondly, it is unwieldly, hard to fill without spilling the grounds, and messy after brewing."
1,K-Cup reusable filter,It did not fit my Keurig. I would like to have one that fits. I don't know why it would not fit
3,Keuring coffee filter,"Filter works fine. Unable to use filter holder and lid - does not fit my Keurig, way too big. The Keurig that this filter with holder is made for should be noted."
5,Works well,Use it. Clean it. Use it again. Use your favoritie coffee you buy in multi cup or pot bags and same mucho dinero.
1,More work than its worth,I bought this so that I could try other brands of coffee without having to order an entire box of k-cups each time I wanted to sample a new flavor. I gave this little device months of use and tried just about every brand of coffee my local stores had to offer. In the end I put the keurig away and bought a regular old coffee brewer. My coffee tasted terrible no matter how much I added or cut back. It leaks something terrible and I ended up with water in my cup and all over my counter. The clean up is messy and scrubbing all the little pieces over and over gets tedious. The few times I tried to use it for company it was embarrassing. It took me forever to make them each a decent sized cup of coffee and clean it all up. I now have a very expensive coffee maker sitting on the shelf collecting dust.
3,Best w V. Germano Fix,"My K-Cup is a very handy addition. It's a little expensive. I'd prefer a set of two for a better price.I immediately brewed two ""large mugs"" on our B-60 one using the My K-Cup right out of the box and the one using the V. Germano review homemade liner in place. The Keurig setup spews the coffee a little carelessly requiring a clean up after brewing. Using the liner almost eliminates the spitting. Using a strong 2 tablespoons of fine ground, not espresso extra fine, the coffee brewed was a little weak for my taste without the liner. The liner improved the strength to where the stock K-Cups usually put it out.I'm glad we bought the product but it is pricey and needs the homemade insert to make acceptable coffee."
2,Do You Like Grounds in Your Coffee?,"I bought this product in an effort to save money and to have less waste as far as the original k-cups. This product does work but I have found that it makes weaker coffee, grounds in the cup and it's quite messy. The coffee maker has water spraying from other areas and even after it has brewed water continues to drip from it. I am continually having not only to clean the baskets which I expected but I also have to clean the brewer after each cup which I never had to do in the past. I would not recommend this product if you are used to the way the k-cups worked for you."
1,Weak coffee/Flawed Design,I've tried different grinds and I've tried the method posted by another reviewer (cutting top rim of used k-cup etc...) It still makes weak coffee. I love my Keurig and will just bite the bullet and buy the pre-made cups.
5,Such a wise invention,"This makes the Keurig less of an expensive coffee maker, letting a person make their favorite coffee without making another person have the same kind. My daughter really is enjoying her Keurig and this little cup is what makes it possible."
4,Never been used,"I bought this, and it is well designed and easy to clean, but I haven't used it beyond my one test coffee run. I like the pre-made K-cups better when I'm rushing, which I always am. That's a shame for the environment."
3,Keurig My K-Cup Reusuable Coffe Filter,Will not fit and unusuable in my Keurig B31 Black Mini Brewer. Nothing wrong with filter other than doesn't work with my Keurig.
2,Over rated!,"First of all, the price was great until you added on the shipping. Could have purchased it for less money at a local store. The seal is not great and allows coffee grounds to get through. Nothing like having to floss after you drink a cup of coffee."
5,We have fun,Making different flavors is so much fun in make coffee for friends coming to visit. Everyone comments on the good flavor.
4,works well,worked as advertised we do not use it very much this is just for that occasional nighttime cup. Coffee taste good.
3,Great Substitute For K-Cup,"When Deidrich stopped making my favorite K-Cup (Paradise House) I needed to go back to my Gevalia coffee. Using this filter is the only way I could do this my my Keruig Coffee Maker. It works well, but is a bit messy. After brewing the coffee, the grinds get all over the devise that the filter screen fits into. You need to rinse it out every time instead of just dumping the grounds. So if you don't have a garbage disposal forget about using this."
1,First time unsuccessful,The first time we used it we had coffee grounds and water everywhere. We are afraird to try it again
2,"EHH, it's ok","I love the idea of this reuable filter. However, coffee grounds always get in my coffee."
3,Keurig My-Cup Coffee Filter,"It works fine but allows coffee sediment to filter thru, so you get this sludge at the bottom of your coffee."
1,I wouldn't buy it,I really do not like quality of the coffee by using this device. I ended up throwing it away. Just buy the prepackaged kcups.
2,weak coffee,The water goes thru it so fast that the coffee grinds are basically dry and the coffee is very weak.
3,What a great idea!,Have to take an important part out of the machine for this to work. Too much work for a quick cup of coffee. Found grounds in my coffee a few times. Not going to use anymore.
1,Extremely Dissatisfied,It never worked properly. My coffee cup is always full of coffee grinds and my top lid broke so now I can't even use it. I would really like to get a GOOD replacement or at least a new lid.
3,"K-cup coffee, lower cost","This is the second K-Cup reusable coffee filter I've bought. Originally I bought one at the store when I purchased my Keurig coffee brewer. Since the K-cups sold for the brewers are so expensive, I decided to use the filter and my own coffees. It's a great idea since I enjoy using the single serve brewer, but I wouldn't be able to continue purchasing the individual pre-filled K-cups. Also, this filter gives you the opportunity to buy any coffee you enjoy while still using your brewer. I didn't rate it 5 stars since it's a little difficult to clean out. I don't want to put the wet coffee remaining in the filter down my drain. I have to bring it to the trash container and keep tapping it on all sides until the wet coffee falls out. But, overall I think it's a great idea and Amazon's price is better then buying it at a store, even if it's on sale."
1,ABSOLUTELY USELESS!,This product is nonfunctional as sold and there is much Keurig does not inform the user of! This thing makes a HUGE MESS... hot wet coffee grounds all over. My machine needs to be taken apart to be properly cleaned! Keurig help desk told me I have to reach into the machine - being careful not to cut myself on the cutting blade inside and readjust the O ring EVERY TIME I use this product! I was told another user placed a rubber washer over his filter and fixed it...How about Keurig engineering just making a product that WORKS! I shouldn't have go buy parts right off the bat!
4,Big time money saver,"Takes much more time cleaning it after each use versus just popping in a new K Cup each time. However I am able to use any coffee that I wish and that saves a ton of money over using the K Cups. I am also able to purchase any coffee at my local grocery store instead of having to drive all the way to a Boston Store, Kohl's, Target, or the horrible Wal-Mart. This reason alone makes this product wonderful!"
2,almost convenient,"The idea -- to allow you to use coffee of your choosing in a Keurig machine -- is a good one both in terms of taste and environmental friendliness. The execution is less than perfect, however. To fill the capsule and place it in the machine is simple. You can remove the part of the assembly the capsule replaces with two fingers. The disappointment is that the capsule lid sits just a bit too high to close the machine all the way and start the brewing cycle. Instead, you have to force the lever down and hold it throughout the brew (always fearing something will break)."
1,Can't Believe How Terrible This Is,I cannot believe what a terrible product this is. I had been using the Solofill reusable cup and needed a second one so thought I would try the Keurig product....talk about being disappointed! Where the Solofill had worked perfectly in my Keurig Coffee maker the one MADE by Keurig was a disaster. During brewing water shot everywhere and there were major coffee grounds in my cup of coffee. I thought that surely I had done something wrong so I went back and reread all the instructions and tried again and the exact same thing.....water shooting out onto the counter during brewing and grounds in my coffee. I went back to my old Solofill and got perfect results. How is it possible that the same people that make the coffee maker can make such a poor product to go with it????
1,Totally worthless,"I was really hoping that this product would work. Every time I have used this I got nothing but weak-dishwater-coffee with grounds included. I tried some of the other suggestions, such as cutting apart a previously used k-cup and it didn't work. Seriously, don't waste your money."
2,whatever,"MAIN PROBLEMI bought 6/7 of these already... the problem is.... the lid closes so tight that it (overtime-from high heat) chip's away at the 3 out-side notches on the cone, that holds the lid. Once the outside notches break, the seal is not tight, and coffee leaks all over the place...then u need to order a new one."
3,Too Expensive,"My daughter just bought a Kuerig for my birthday. The machine works wonderfully but I was concerned with having to get K-cups. She informed me of a filter you could by to use regular coffee. So we went out and bought one, for 14$. The exact same filter as the one shown here. 47$ is to much to pay for this little piece of plastic. It also doesn't work all that well. You have to remove the K-cup hold from your machine (very easy to do)to use it. It squirts a little water out at the end of the cycle which makes a mess and then you have to clean the filter. Bah, I'd rather just pay for the K-cups and keep this filter for an coffee emergency. Note: after making the coco if you open the top of the k-cup there is a little dry powder left to make the coco a little stronger."
1,Company hard to deal with,Coffee grounds came through the filter. We even went to our local coffee shop and told them to give of a courser grind and it still didn't came through we tried to return the product but after we would have been forced to pay shipping and handling and not getting a full return we would have lost more money.
1,too difficult to use,It is too difficult to install and use I am returning it in the box it came in Ellen Levitt
5,So convenient!,"What has held me back from getting the one-cup coffee maker until now is the fact that I thought I had to use the pre-packaged coffee inserts and not my regular blend, but this filter makes it possible. It's easy to use, easy to rinse out, just perfect!"
4,Useful Accessory,I like my Keurig and I like strong distinctive coffee that said - everyone in the house doesn't. Makes coffee that is not as strong. Allows using your own ground blend - great for those addicted to some other blend. Allows you to make tea. Requires some experimentation. Incidentally Keurig makes one of these that has more space for coffee and makes stronger coffee but it requires you to take the standard bucket out. It's more economical than the prepackaged K-cups makes OK coffee but it's messy and requires some experimentation to get it right.
2,for finely ground coffee only I guess,"When using the regular ground coffee I buy at the grocery store, even filling the basket up all the way with coffee will not brew a strong enough cup...it turns out very light and tea-like. If you buy the finely ground coffee or have a grinder and can grind your own then I'm sure it will work just fine."
2,"Usable, Saves $$, but overall not a good product.","With the price of cups, I figured this would be a great deal. Well, first of all-it leaks water/coffee EVERYWHERE (sputtering and dripping). 99% of the time I end up with loose grounds in my cup. I have made sure to follow directions and have been EXTRA careful not to get grounds outside of the filter, but they always sneak in there. Also, in order to get a ""full"" cup out of my Keurig, I need to run it twice. With the reusable cup, it is a major hassle to clean it out and re-load it. Yes, I have tried simply adding more coffee to the cup-but that takes just as long in order to keep the grounds from sneaking outside of the filter. And, again, it results in more grounds in my cup. The time I waste with all of this hassle has driven me back to buying the cups. Maybe that was their plan all along.....there are a couple other brands out that that I intend to try."
1,Good for the forst 2 months.,"I was happy that they offered this product, that is until I got more then a month of use out of it. It is so clogged right now, that I have to purchase a new one. Not to mention that when I first used it I would have overspill surrounding the holder, so I naturally thought that adding less grounds would solve the problem...well it did not. I think the best thing to use for coffee is a french press, so it looks like I have an expensive cabinet ornament for now on."
2,Kcup Insert,"The product holds the correct amount of coffee grounds and fits into the coffee maker correctly, but the water doesn't go straight through the insert, so much water comes around it -- which makes the coffee unnecessarily watery -- and ground drip through the hole into the coffee cup. Using it allows me to use my favorite brand and flavor of coffee, but makes a less than ideal cup of it."
4,Works but water will leak out,"My unit looks like the one in customer pic with gray outer shell.Actually this device operates in an ingenious but simple way. When the hot water is injected into the basket, with the coffee grounds, it creates a crater down through the middle of the coffee grounds and pushes the coffee out around the inside perimeter of the basket where water is then forced from the center of the basket outwards.Has it downside. To prevent pressure from building and thus damaging an internal valve(s)of the main unit ,there or three slit type openings on the gray cap which, water will seep out during the brewing process so you have to hold your cup right up to the underside of the machine to prevent a mess.Another issue is, in my opinion this device is way over priced. So shop around online to find the best deal."
1,Terrible!!,"This seems like a great alternative to K-cups individual, single use coffees but it does not work. I bought it for my Dad as a Father's day gift and he can't even use it because it spews coffee grounds and hot water everywhere. I looked it up and there are ways to rig it with aluminum foil so that it does not leak but I haven't tried any of them yet. Definitely not worth purchasing!"
1,Read 1-2 Star Reviews Before You Buy,"I typically read reviews on Amazon before buying something. For some reason this time I didn't. I bought the Keurig K-Cup Reuasable and read all the directions. Then proceeded to make 7 different types of coffee with different types of grind (coarse grind to fine). Nothing worked. I also tried to fill it 1/4 way to full and nothing worked. The issue is that the machine attempts to fill the cup so fast, that the coffee plus the filter element can't drain the liquid fast enough. Hence the water overflows over the cup and drips down into your cup, making watered down coffee. Do not buy."
2,"Good thought, but missing something","This would be a great addition to the Keurig, but it's design is lacking. No matter how fine or course the grind, or the fill level, there is always back flow and water escapes. Why, because they want it to work like the k-cups and have the coffee go out the sides. If they simply put a filter at the bottom along with the sides, I can bet the overflow flow would be greatly diminished."
3,Great concept if you like the hassle!,"I was so excited about being able to drink my favorite coffee and not have to purchase the wasteful k-cups. This product works exactly like it's supposed to and I haven't had any issues (coffee grounds in my cup, etc)! My biggest complaint is the hassle of having to switch out the k-cup housing every time I want to use My K-cup. It's a pain. I think I've found a new product that will resolve this hassle. Otherwise, it's ok."
1,brews VERY weak coffee,"I have been giving this filter try after try with hopes each time it would be better. It just does not brew right. first, i wanted it bc i thought i'd save money brewing bagged coffee than k-cups, but you have to fill the filter to the top for a cup of coffee (about 3 1/2 scoops).Its always weak, ive figured out that patting down the coffee grinds tightly as i put them in helps, also theres a rubber washer above the keurig brewer, if you pull that lower to make sure of an air-tight closer also helps a little, not much. all this work to save a buck, really takes from the point of the keurig. also, with nearly 4 scoops of coffee for the filter, youre really not saving money- might as well stick with the k-cups. not worth the nearly $20 for he filter. I got mine included with my purchase, thankfully. Had i bought it seperately, I'd return it."
2,Leaks like a sieve...,"This leaked very badly when I first received. Fortunately a friend of mine who has the same keurig found a small washer that fits on the top. The makes a good seal, which stopped the leak. Now it is working. Kuerig needs to improve the cap."
3,replacing the k-cup,"The product was purchased to save money and the environment. The product itself works fine, you will have more coffee residue than with either a K-cup or regular drip. The biggest challenge we found,having gotten spoiled by the wonderful coffee from K-cup varieties,is finding the perfect grind setting and type of coffee that gives the rich full flavor of the K-cup."
4,The Keurig My K Cup,"I just purchased a Keurig Elite B-40. Love the coffee flavor with the K cups, but had a lot of trouble working the My K Cup reusable filter. But after reading a few other reviews and trying some of the suggestions given there my husband tried what finally worked. Lift the lever, pull down on the black rubber ring that surrounds the needle the punctures the regular K cups. The problem with water dripping everywhere and weak coffee will be eliminated if you do this. Pull it down almost to the end, allowing only the needle to show at the bottom. When the latch is closed, the proper seal will be made in contact with the My K Cup lid preventing water leaking over and around the top of the My K Cup. The water will go into the filter where it belongs and out the bottom of the My K Cup housing and into your cup....Yeah, now I don't have to return it!"
1,"Weak coffee, water everywhere","I followed the directions to the letter, putting in only 2 tbs of the 2.7 that the manufacturer states will fit in the basket. Water ran out of the top of the filter and splashed all over the cup and the counter-top during the brew cycle. The coffee was very weak and for me, undrinkable.Coffee drinkers who prefer their cup black and not overly strong will probably be satisfied with the My K-cup (after they learn the trick of getting it to not leak all over the place. Not sure what that is but I assume it's possible since other people have managed it.) Those who prefer espresso, stronger drip coffee or that like to add cream and sugar and still enjoy a nice coffee flavor will likely be disappointed."
2,Waste of money,I was very disappointed this didn't work for me. Coffee was water and water was all over my counter. Returned immediately
1,leaks water EVERYWHERE,"we bought this thinking it would be amazing... well we were wrong. Not only does it brew a weak cup of coffee it leaks everywhere. Water runs out of it, onto the counter, into your coffee.. it is just a mess. We tired everything, not filling it up that much (but then you are still left with really weak coffee). We used all of the cup settings.. There is even a review on here about using a K-cup to help with the water going through to fast.. Did that, and still had the same result.. Save yourself the money... do not get this.... There is another product on the market that is designed like an actual K-cup and it sits in the filter... we bought that one, and so far we have had no problems..."
5,Returned item,We got an Office Pro model - Keurig does not make a re-useable filter for this model;sounded good at the time.
1,sad lady,This part does not fit into my new Keurig K-cup coffee maker. It was probably my fault for not checking the part numbers etc.
3,$8 at the grocery store,Haven't really used it but I noticed the local grocery store carries these for about $8-12. I bought the Kuerig super coffee maker thing for my mommy. Since I have no need for a coffee maker.Just thought I'd post the price.I noticed at Fred Meyers (Kroger) near my home it was either $8.99 or $7.99 on sale. Regular price I believe was 10.99.
5,amazingness,"This machine is by far one of the easiest machines to use. Not to mention that the cleaning is a breeze. I go my closest Bed Bath and Beyond and buy coffee, which they have a great assortment always in stock and the coupons save me money. NO SHIPPING. I would recommend this machine over any regular coffee pot any day of the week."
3,a better product is available,Perfect Pod Holster Use Any Pod in Your Keurig Coffee Makerthis is better and easier to use
1,K cups and the environment,"Do not buy k cups. They are all plastic, not separatable and there for not recycled. Bad for our environment !So why not buy the re usable kcup filter and buy your favorite coffee to use in your keurig! You can save a ton of money and buy the best fresh roasted coffee available from your local roaster, everyone wins! Especially the environment !There is a newly designed cup available.Check out-Ekobrew."
3,Customer not used.,"It's me again, and I want to thank you for letting to go shopping. Online with your company of Amazon.com. I bought this for my mom. To start things off, my dad bought my mom a new Keurig coffee maker. And we all got stuff, for it. And I bought her make yourself Keurig, K cup filter. To brew your own coffee, the coffee that we have right at home. And she doesn't use it. Cause I would have thought, that she would throw away. The old coffee maker that we still have. And she has not yet."
1,Will I ever get this package??,"I ordered several items on the same day 8/7. They were packaged in 3 different shipments due to different suppliers for each. Today is 8/19 and 2 out of the 3 packages arrived promptly within the first 5 days via UPS. The third package was shipped USPS and I have yet to receive it even though I received a shipping confirmation and tracking number on 8/8. VERY SLOW, POOR SHIPPING SERVICE!! I entered the confirmation on the USPS tracking website and it doesn't recognize it. I entered it on the FedEx tracking website and all it says is that it shipped on 8/8. No other information exists.Not sure that I'll ever get my package!"
1,Keurig Reuseable Filter,Can not really say good or bad. The model of Keurig I have this unit will not work.
3,SO-SO,"THINK ABOUT IT, EVERY TIME YOU WANT A CUP, YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS REUSABLE FILTER OUT OF THE MACHINE. DUMP OLD GROUNDS, WASH OUT FILTER AND CONTAINER. THEN REFILL CONTAINER WITH YOUR OWN COFFEE. IT WORKS O.K., JUST ALOT OF EXTRA STEPS. NOT LIKE POPPING IN A K-CUP AND YOUR DONE."
4,Great Magnification,"This is a great mirror for applying make-up, plucking, etc. It fits nicely in your palm, but is large enough to be effective. I bought a similar mirror at the drug store and the magnification does not compare to this mirror. The casing is plastic, and not extravagent, but the mirror itself is effective. Definitely a good value."
1,my K-cup,I have not used my K-cup yet. I am enjoying using the already made K-cups for pot. I have heard some negatives about the My K-cup reusable coffee filter. I probably will not use mine.
1,never used it,"I returned the filter because the keurig coffee machine did not make hot coffee so I sent them both back . I never used the filter so I realy can`t rate it. BUT I did use the coffee machine with the k-cups and I could not get hot coffee, not hot enough for me anyway."
2,Reusable Filter... A Big Mess!,"The Keurig reusable coffee filter and holder is a joke. Cleaning the basket only takes seconds, but, the mess it makes while brewing is not worth the effort and buying K-Cups can get to be pricey for a daily coffee drinker such as myself. After months of wanting a Keurig, I decided the drip coffee maker I already had wasn't so bad after all."
1,The negative reviews are correct.,"Only buy this if you want a mess and a headache. Following the instructions exactly is no help. Water will leak all over the counter and under the coffeemaker, your coffee will be weak, and grounds will enter your cup. I wish I knew how those with positive reviews got it to work, but after multiple attempts with various alterations to method, no joy."
1,dont waste your money!,"I can not believe keurig would make such an inferior product! If you fill it up all the way you have crunchy coffee(grinds in coffee). If you only fill half to 3/4 way all you get is flavored hot water! I also even notice clear water coming into my cup as well. Not sure why that is happening. I saw some of the other generic (ie ekobrew, the one made by solo cup) and thought no, better get the name brand and the one that was made for the machine. Now i regret,$16 down the drain. Just purchased the ekobrew and hope it is better!"
1,This is crap,Lets see...here it goes1. coffee is weak..undrinkable...tastes like crap2. water sprays all over...what a mess..3. grounds come up over the fiter and get into your coffee4. Brews way less than the K-cup mainly because the rest of the water is all over your counter and coffee maker5. Can't do a second cup quickly...too hot to handle the filter to clean it out...and messy.I totally wasted $15 on this item. What a waste of money.Hint to mfgs....the Keurig system works with HIGH PRESSURE forcing water through the coffee grounds quickly producing a GREAT cup of full bodied coffee...hence the slight foam on the top. This lid has no seal at the top....first time I used it I noticed it and wondered how it would work without a seal. It doesn't. My belief is that if a seal was put on the lid it would work fine. If you open a K-cup after use the coffee is smashed against the lid...but the sealed cup keeps the water and grounds from coming out the top. Bad design...good idea.
2,no cover,I didnt care for the filterits a great idea. it just didt have a cover for the filter when you put it in the Keurig. Makes a horrible mess
2,Weak,"It gets two stars because it can hold coffee grounds, that's about all its good for. Even with a really fine grind the coffee is very weak. I went and found some solutions to the problem that are fairly easy and make the product serviceable, but that's no excuse for a poor design from Keurig. I guess they would prefer you spent more money on buying their K-cups all of the time."
1,It doesn't work,"I double checked to be sure it was made for our machine. It was. The water sprays like a sprinkler head, wide of the biggest mouth cup we have. That is the biggest complaint we have. It also deposits grounds in the cup. I could live with that. Overall, a big disappointment."
2,Don't get it for Tea,I didn't know this product couldn't be used for tea until I got it and read the product information in the box. That is what I bought it for; not much coffee drinking in our house to need this. It pretty much is sitting on the counter collecting dust.
1,Disappointed,I returned this product as it doesn't work well at all.The water goes right down the center of the container and never comes in contact with all the coffee resulting in a brew that resembles very weak tea.Called the rep for Keurig to see what I maybe was doing wrong.They admitted to me that the design wasn't thought out well enough.That was enough for me to return the product.Dennis Sweetman
5,a must have,"Great product, allows me to use large canned coffee in my Keurig machine (this saves lots of money). The filters do clog up in time but replacements are cheep $10.00 for 2 on Keurig site. Perfect for specialty coffee, your favorite standard coffee, or home ground coffee."
2,"Not this one, get the Fill N Brew instead!!","I purchased this with great anticipation and was quickly disappointed. First, you must modify your Keurig by removing the k-cup holder and replacing it with this one. Each time you decide to go back to the k-cup, you must swap out the holders. WORST of all, you must then modify this DEFECTIVE product (read other reviews) to keep it from leaking while brewing. I did read a good fix on here that was done with a couple rubber bands, but hey..should I HAVE to modify a new product so that it work properly? My husband, knowing the frustration I've had with this little thing, happened to stumble upon [...] while shopping at Publix. OMG, it changed my life! No worrying about having to wash out a reusable filter; no having to worry what germs may be collecting around my rubber band modification...just slip in a filter, push a button and poof. When ready for next cup, just dump old filter in trash and repeat. Fill N Brew works like a charm!!"
3,Why mess with a perfect idea,"We purchased this to complement our Kuerig, but never use it. It is a pain to fill and clean. We found it best just to use to pre-filled cups. It works fine, but why mess with perfection? Just buy the k-cups and enjoy."
1,Horrible product...creates a big mess,"Stay away from this product! Although the concept is great, the execution is horrible. I have tried on a half-dozen attempts to brew a single cup of coffee without success. I follow the instructions to the letter, and all that happens is that water pours out of the lid, coffee grounds are forced out of the basket holder into your coffee mug, and the coffee itself is nothing more than very weak, coffee-flavored water. I have experimented, using various amounts of grounds to see if that makes a difference, it doesn't. All you end up is with a big mess to clean up and very weak coffee with grounds in it. Definitely a total waste of money."
1,REUSABLE FILTER - TERRIBLE!,"The idea is great but the functionality of the product is terrible. Wasted too much time trying to figure out how much coffe to use to suit my taste and if I wanted to clean filters after every cup, I would have stuck with my Mr. Coffee coffeemaker. The idea of just popping in a k-cup and getting a hot cup of delicious coffee in less than a minute with virtually no clean up is what appealed to me in the first place. That's why I bought the brewer. I'd rather spend the extra money on k-cups than deal with this product. There are other dealers that sell the k-cups cheaper than Keurig with free shipping options."
5,Try it,"I am still able to use my coffee service with the Keurig machine.I tend to over pack the coffee though, best to make 2 or more usages, as it has clogged the machines output, which is easily cleared."
2,More work than a coffee pot,"It's great that Keurig offers a way to use any coffee brand in their machine, but this reusable filter is a pain to utilize because you have to first remove the K-Cup holder in order to install it. After using it, you have to clean out the filter, which involves banging out all the old coffee into the trash and then either wiping the inside with a paper towel or washing it in a sink. Do yourself a favor and buy the new insert which has filters and fits in the existing holder."
1,horrible!,don't waste your time with this piece of junk. it makes the weakest coffee ever. go with the solofill instead. i have great results with that.
1,needs to be better engineered,"I have tried this several times with terrible results. Every time the water comes pouring out of the top and drips into the mug without coffee while some water goes through the filter. Thought maybe I had put too much coffee in but it doesn't seem to matter. It is an expensive accessory for something that doesn't work well. Good idea, bad execution. I will give it a couple more attempts but am getting tired of cleaning up the grounds that come pouring out of the top of the device(and those are the ground that didn't manage to make their way into the mug)"
1,Refuses to work,I use my single serve Keurig at work and someone who used it last must have tossed out the filter part- I wound up purchasing 2 fiters and now it doesn't work at all. I really wanted this to work but i realize for all the effort pour over works just fine. When I'm at work and Im bothering to use a grinder for my own fresh beans the only extra step is to toss some water in the microwave and I can make it as strong as I like. I just cant get this filter to work with my single serve machine so I'm back to the K-cups for meetings. it refuses to start- a total waste of $.
3,Cracked!,"We purchased this item in August. Now, just over 2 months later, the top of it has cracked to the point that it is nearly unusable. We really love the ability to brew our own coffee from our Keurig, but not sure if we are doing something wrong that caused the cracking?"
3,Good,It is a good item but I do not think it is worth the price. I might buy it again if it comes down in price.
3,k,"Might as well make a full pot of coffee, much more cost efficient. My coffee was stronger on the regular pot."
4,K-cup reusable filter SAVES MONEy,you can really save money per cup. it works very well and you can determine the amount or strength you desire. it can SAVE you MONEY......
2,"it works, sort of","Used this with one of my favorite coffees. The results still weren't as good as with my drip machine, so why bother?"
5,Very Handy Accesssory,"For those of you who have a Keurig Machine - this accessory is very handy.If cost is an issue, the unit will pay for itself in a short period of time.K-Cups are great, however some of us like a special grind not availble pre-packaged. My iniatal interest in the ""re-usual k-cup"" grew after reading onAmazon how others were also enjoying their special flavor. Also, who among us isnot concerned with disposable K-Cups being added to our waste stream?Obviously the Keurig K Cup System offers many benefits that I need notreiterate. Let us discuss this filter: an earlier review mentioned the ""ears""on top cover lid will break off after a year of use. We have used this Filterevery day for 3 months with out any issue.I've promised myself to handle this carefully as the reviewer warned.Very good for ""using up"" the partial bags of coffee in freezer -Rinse well after use - let the 3 parts dry separated.Well made product, we are very happy with it."
1,Makes incredibly weak coffee,"This product is simply too small to make a good cup of coffee. It holds about half of what I would normally use to make a normal cup of coffee with a standard coffee maker. The water appears to just flow through the middle of the filter without adequately soaking the grounds around the edges. There appears to be some ""hacks"" that people are suggesting to make this product usable, but as this product stands on its own, it makes terrible coffee. You'd be far better off just using a standard coffee maker than using a Keurig and this filter."
4,kcup reusable filter,I am very pleased with this product. It is as great way to enjoy my new Keurig brewer and save money on the coffee I use. The only draw back is the filter will leak over the top unless you hold down the handle of the brewer while making coffee.
1,not good,"coffee sedament passes through filter screen,only holds enough coffee for small cup of coffee,tried using kcup paper filters,this stoped the sedament but still made weak coffee,tried other methods,nothing worked,ekobrew filter works better,but still only makes small cup of coffee,waste of money,went back to my mr coffee drip coffee maker,get my 18oz cup every morning,kcups are good for quick small cups ,not good for large mugs."
3,It's alright.,"This product is useful if you make your own coffee a lot. The only problem, like everyone else says, is that sometimes the grains get in the actual coffee."
3,Ok but inconvenient to fill each time you want coffee.,Easier making a pot of coffee that will give you more than one cup of coffee. End results not acceptable.
2,K-Cup,"Although the product is well made, this particular item was not designed for my model of the Keurig coffee maker. I did not check to see if it was compatible with what i have. My ratings have nothing to do with the seller or the product itself but on my usefulness for my coffee maker.I gave the seller 5 stars for his solution to my situation."
2,Good Idea....Needs Work,I love my Keuring coffee machine because it is so fast and easyto get a cup of coffee. This product takes away the fast and theeasy. I would rather go back to my regular coffee pot.
3,A better solution...,"Although the My K-Cup is a solution to using your own coffee grounds, there is a better & less expensive option out there. I found the My Kap ([...]) to be a much better alternative because you can reuse your old K-cups. Where the bulky My K-Cup requires you to remove the Keurig's K-Cup inner assembly and also allows the water to flow freely from all sides of the filter, the My-Kap simply snaps onto an old cup, allowing you to reuse your K-Cups several times, and only allowing the water to flow through the bottom pinhole. Also, you cannot store the My K-Cup in your carousel (if you have one), whereas the My-Kap allows you to by reusing your old cups. Lastly, at two My-Kaps for $10, it's a slightly more economical choice than the My K-Cup. I bought mine a week ago and couldn't be happier."
5,"Saves money, but only use store ground","i use this k-cup reusable filter so i can pick and choose the coffee i want. the only problem is that my home grinder creates small coffee particles that gum up the filter. eventually, it stops working. It can be cleaned with a power washer, but that is a bit of a pain. so i just stick to store ground coffee for this filter.i give it 5 stars because it is easy to use, saves money, provides me more choices of coffee than pre-packaged k-cups, and lasts a long time. i would give it three stars if i was intent on using my home coffee grinder."
1,Please be advised My K Cup does not fit Mini Keurig,"I purchased the Mini (personal one cup) Keurig as a gift and along with it I purchased the single ""My K Cup"" with the understanding that it would fit the Mini Keurig. It does not. Having read the description of the My K Cup before purchasing, I mis-understood all of the product model number verbiage and, as a result, the filter did not fit the machine. I am writing this review as a FYI to those individuals who may purchase the Mini Keurig on Amazon and then see the Keurig My K Cup Reusable Coffee Filter under the ""also purchased with"" area. Please do not be deceived into thinking that if you are purchasing the Mini Keurig and this filter shows up under the product in the ""also purchased with"" that it is going to fit this machine, as it does not."
1,Makes a mess!,"I don't know if I'm using it wrong or something, but almost every time I use it it overflows with the coffee grains all over my counter. It worked perfect first 2 times... then nothing...I'm using the old model, but everything seems to fit on it fine."
1,keurig coffee filter,Don't recommend as coffee grounds seep through filter and into coffee cup. Not very pleasant for guests drinking it.
2,Not quite what I expected,"I filled the filter with coffee ground the way specified in the directions. End result, water sprayed slightly around the coffee cup as well as in it, coffee was weak, filter a little hard to clean and you have to wait until it cools down before you can take it apart and clean it to make a second cup."
1,Coffee flavored water.,"This filter sucks. I used french press grind, and drip grind, as specifically instructed in the included sheet. The coffee is weak and watery, and is nearly clear as it streams into the cup, and the final product is pathetic, though coffee colored. The first second after it starts running the brew is dark, but that's it, supporting the theory that the water is pushing a clear path through the grounds, and not steeping the coffee at all. I wonder if they didn't specifically make the thing crap to encourage people to buy more overpriced K cups. Very disappointed, and more than a bit angry about it."
2,Weak coffee,"Works fine. I don't get the grinds that others complain about, but the coffee produced is very weak. Tried various grinds including very fine and the coffee is still too weak."
2,Leaks water every time,"Read the discussion board about the filter leaking water. I've tried every remedy I can think of, but the filter leaks a large amount of water every time, leading to a weak cup of coffee. Many people suggest ""fixes"" by using washers, slices of wine cork, etc. I'm not impressed with a product that requires me to perform more R&D for Keurig to get it to work as advertised."
3,Leaks but worth it!,"The concept is wonderful and certainly saves costs. The coffee pods for this machine are pricey, and the taste and strength varies with each brand. So when I researched and saw this was available,I ordered one. My Keurig leaks when I use the K-cup, but if I place a wide mug underneath, that takes care of the problem. Sometimes the Keurig is stubborn and won't work - as if it doesn't recognize the K-cup - but if I unplug the unit and plug it back in, it will work. The worst part is that there are always grounds in my coffee cup. However, that can be easily remedied by getting a coarser ground coffee, which I intend to do once I've used these coffee grounds. Would I order again? Heck, yeah. I like the savings."
4,Good service,The K-Cup came quickly - good service from Amazon! Would purchase this product again and most definitely will purchase again with Amazon!
3,"Works, but not as well as I hoped","We followed all the instructions for using this reusable coffee filter, but it tends to leak water every time we use it. It's acting like the filter is blinding over with coffee faster than the water can drain through, hence the water overflows the top of the filter. We've tried using less coffee grounds and that seems to help a little. It still makes a good cup of coffee, it's just not quite as easy and mess free as I would have hoped."
3,Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter,"This little filter is what helped to sell me on my new Keurig Elite coffee system.In those times where you've run out of coffee pods or simply want a cup of coffee thats not available in the pods yet, you can use this filter for your own ground coffee.I had to use it a few times to figure out you need to use the ""small cup"" feature on the machine to get a strong cup of coffee, otherwise its too watered down. Nice to have in a pinch, but i wouldn't want to use it everyday."
1,Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter,"I purchased the K-Cup thinking I would most likely get the best reusable filter from Keurig.I was wrong. The first time I used it, water splatted all over the base of my coffee maker and the counter.The second time I used it, I used less coffee, thinking that I may have overfilled it. Still made a mess.I gave it a third chance with paper towels spread out under my coffee maker. Decided I didn't want to haveto do that every time. I ordered Cafe Cups on line and they work great! Keurig needs to redesign...."
3,Better options available.,This reusable K-cup filter works fine but there are better options available in my opinion. I don't like the fact that you have to remove the brewing basket that has the bottom needle in it to use this filter. This isn't a huge deal but when I'm in a hurry to leave for work this is an extra step that I shouldn't have to take. There are other reusable filters out there like the Ekobrew and Solofil filters that work just as good if not better AND work with the needle in place. I bought two of the Ekobrew filters and have never used this filter again.
2,Weak coffee,"I like my coffee on the strong side, so I usually buy extra bold K-cups. Try as I might I can not get this thing to brew a cup anywhere close to as strong as the premade stuff."
1,Doesn't work unless you don't mind weak coffee,"I bought this at bbb and it just didn't work. I tried. God knows I tried to adjust the amount of coffee, the type of grind, and tried some of the tips other posters suggested and still ended up with a lame cup of coffee. I was thrilled when I got a Keurig and have enjoyed the great tasting coffee cups I've purchased. But like many people the cost of the pre-made cups is wearing on me and I'd love to e able to produce my own. Not with this though. I took it back but will continue to try different reusable items until I can make a great strong cup of coffee."
3,not worth the expense,"I received my Keurig as a gift. I love the coffee however found it a bit spendy. I purchased a My K-Cup reusable coffee filter. it was spendy, but I thought it would be better than tossing out disposable K-cups. I have found it awkward to use. Remembering to remove and replace the holder for disposable k-cups is a bit of a pain. I always feel dumb when I forget to put it back in to make cocoa or cider. The coffee tastes weak, no matter how much french roast I use. Clean up of the My K-cup is easy, but now it mostly sits in its box. I am using a different system. Too bad I spent the $17 first..."
2,Keurig K-cup reusable filter,Have not been able to find a coffee that tastes as good as the ready to serve K-cups. Coffe tastes watered down no matter what size cup you choose. Have tried different amounts of coffee in the filter but the WOW is missing. Do not use this filter at all.
2,Good for a little while.,"Bought this product in early Jan 2012. It worked well and I did not have issues with my coffee being weak. I do like strong coffee. I did take a few days to get it right. After two months of light use, usually 2 times a day sometimes 3, it started to crack. I wasn't rough with it and I did not drop it. Took care when I cleaned it. Now it is virtually useless. Other reviews stated this issue. Should have heeded those warnings."
3,Use a conical burr grinder set to Espresso for fiar results,"My title really says it all. The grinds will be ""blown"" all around the filter, eliminating the problem with water washing off the top of the grinds without steeping.Honestly though, for all this trouble why not just buy a $3.50 pour-over filter and get a far better result for almost the same inconvenience."
2,Not as good as I thought,This container is a bit inefficient. You have to be extremely careful of the amount of coffee you put into it as you can easily get grinds in your cup.
1,Very weak coffee,"I'm not sure what the trick is, but while the quality seems ok (have to be gentle cleaning the screen), it brews a very weak cup of coffee. I tried filling it to different levels, using different size cup settings on the machine, and it just comes out weak.Is there a secret to it? I agree also that it puts a lot of mud in the bottom of the cup. Luckily I only spent $4.95 on it at Target, a good deal compared to what I've seen here."
5,Fantastic!,"This adapter works great! Simply pull the current sleeve that you slip your k-cup into and put this one in and you are ready to go. With this adapter you use your own coffee rather than buying k-cups. Even at a discounted $11/box through my job, k-cups are .40 each (plus tax). With this adapter you can put in your own coffee, screw on the top, put in your Keurig coffee maker and still get that fast cup of great tasting coffee. The little basket filter cleans easy enough. This is a three piece adapter. The fine mesh filter basket slips inside of the larger adapter and a cap screws on. This was an excellent investment."
4,good product,I like these refullable K cups but the single piece one I got I think is superior in design and less things to wash.
2,Keurig could have done better.,The other manufacturers of coffee filler/filters undertand that the consumer doesn't what to have to dismantle their machine just to use their own coffee blend.
3,So so,"The reusable filter is nice to have so that any kind of coffee can be used, but having to clean it after every cup is a little excessive. Overall does the job."
4,Does the Job.,"No instructions included, and i couldn't see how to get it into the Keurig, so I went online and got a visual on YouTube. Works great."
1,Does not fit,Make sure it fits! I have the smaller k-cup machine.. Does not fit my machine. Had to buy a smaller ones at Walgreens
3,Not there more than it is,"I bought this so I could get away from the obscene prices of k-cups. I assume it works, I have not used it a great deal because I prefer the solo fill, simply because you do not have to gut the Keurig to use them. I will see how fine grind will filter or not filter."
4,"4 Stars if modified, 3 stars as is","If you follow the instructions in V. Germano's October 10, 2008 review, you can make an acceptable K-cup out of your own coffee with the My K-Cup. It closes the sides of the My K-cup to allow for more mixing (turbulence) of the coffee, which is essential for extracting full flavor.Even better, though is My-Kap - Reuse Your Keurig K-Cups (1 Clear, 1 Red, 1 Green), but it requires a little more careful handling as it reuses an actual K-cup and its sealed paper filter inside.I have and use both. It just depends on whether I'm in a hurry (My K-Cup) or not (My-Kap)."
2,Not so hot!,"I was looking forward to having something to use for my own coffee in my new Keurig coffee maker. I don't like it, the coffee comes out too weak, so it forces me to use the pre-made pods - which I don't mind using, they are pretty good."
5,BEST COFFEE MAKER,SURE BEATS BUYING THOSE SINGLE PORTIONS AT THE HIGH PRICES. A POUND OF GOOD COFFEE COST APROX. $7.00 TO 10.OO DOLLARS AND YOU CAN MAKE ROUGHLY 32 TO 35 CUPS.
4,Works great with the device.,"Works great, just follow directions. One problem is if you grind your coffee to much, it will clog your coffeemaker. So be careful"
3,Works well but...,"I recently purchased this item since k-cups are about .75-.90 each I figured I could just fill this and save about .40 per cup and I did. The problem is with the reusable k-cup is you need to remove the whole internal cup puncturing mechanism (could be tough for an older person who might buy this to save money) but it is not extremely difficult to do just be careful there are razor sharp pins inside. The other draw back is the screen of the cup is only on the sides (bottom of cup is solid plastic). At first its like yeah so what, but when you go to rinse out the coffee grounds you will see what a PITA it is. All in all this is a good product that does what it says it will but has some design flaws. If you are older and have arthritis in your fingers or have lost some dexterity I would not recommend this particular k-cup refill."
1,awful design,"picked up one of these after I got a B60 SE for christmas. Make very weak, muddy coffee that is full of grounds (yes I moved the needle seal a bit, to no avail). My take on the problem with this unit is (1. the filter is not deep enough (plenty of room to make it slightly longer) and (2. the filter holder needs an o-ring seal to seal around the needle more effectively. Just my $.02...."
1,WEAK Coffee no matter what!,"Despite going through an entire POUND of coffee in just one week (usually lasts 4 weeks with my drip maker), I am yet to have one single cup of decent coffee from this filter. Every cup has been terribly WEAK! I've tried all the tricks, including the ultra-grind, the course grind, and the cup within a cup thing. Always, the SAME result. Dishwater. The only way I can get any strength at all is to FILL the My K-cup with coffee, then run the machine on the tiny cup setting, then clean and refill the filter with fresh grounds and do this cycle TWO more times to get coffee cup near full. That's a HUGE amount of coffee (not to mention time and mess) to go through to make a single cup to drink. My old drip maker (Krups) would make the same volume of coffee at TWICE the strength with just one third of the coffee grounds. The My K-cup allows channeling of water through the grounds so most of the coffee goes to waste. A very poor design."
5,Very good filter,"I like this filter because it allows me to use the coffee I have used for years, and like very much. Other coffee/tea makers of this type does not offer this filter, and you can not use your coffee which forces you to buy their coffee which can be very expensive even if you grow to like it."
3,Doesn't fit in my machine,"So I am a tea drinker, not a coffee drinker. I wanted this so I could brew loose-leaf teas. The only problem is that I cannot close the top of the machine when this is in it, it doesn't fit. I can close it enough to brew, but I have to hold it the whole time."
2,Not very durable,"At first it worked fineas long as I did not over fill it with coffeeif you put too much coffee in the containerthen you will have coffee grounds in the brewafter a while the cap would no longer sealcoffee grounds in the brew every timeafter 2 months there is no more seal at all and now is uselessI threw it away,One more thing, The cap should have a rubber seal in itit would make the seal tighter and probably work better"
1,"Weak coffee, leaks when brews","I have had this for a couple of weeks, only used it twice, and both times have been thoroughly disappointed. As other reviews have mentioned, this yields weak coffee when a regular coffee mate would make a delicious pot of coffee. I made sure to fill it as much coffee grind as I can and still, no luck with the taste. It has also been consistent in spewing coffee-water out when it's brewing in all directions. My K-cups work fine, so I know this isn't due to my Keurig. I took a look at it more carefully and it seems that this coffee filter gets filled with water too quickly and pours out of the top. This is probably why it's so watery-- half the water doesn't even make it through the coffee. I don't know if the coffee isn't ground finely enough or what, but I am extremely dissatisfied with this product."
5,Perfect for buying coffee in bulk,"Got this item as a gift to accompany the Keurig brewer. It's great for buying coffee in bulk, for those who grind their own beans and for loose leaf tea. I am such a fan"
1,Coffee grounds everywhere!,"This reusable filter is completely useless. Water and grounds poured out the sides of the cup gushing all over the place. After cleaning up the mess and thinking I must have done something wrong, I re-read the directions and tried again. Again, water and grounds everywhere. What a waste of money!"
2,Not what i expected,"I bought this to use my own coffee that I prefer. Being it was from the Keurig company, I thought it would work perfectly. Perhaps I just haven't found the right grind yet, but it gets water everywhere and grinds & sludge end up in the cup....I just thought it being from the company that makes the brewer, it would work flawlessly....."
3,K-cup - use your own coffee,This product does OK but does not make as good a cup as the k-cups. I recommend that you buy a strong coffee if you use this or it will be weaker than you expect. Overall the product is not bad to have around and certainly makes your price per cup lower than using the k-cups but you do have to clean it up.
2,not good if you have to find the right coffe,i spent alot of money trying to find coffe to use with this.I like strong coffe and the coffee I have tried with come out like water very very light .Not for me.Sorry
3,more environmentally friendly,"I've used this product when I ran out of kcups. I like that it is more environmentally friendly than throwing away a plastic cup every day, but I find it hard to get the used grounds out of the filter without running it under water. I don't have a disposal in my sink, and I'm not sure I want all those grounds plugging up my sink."
4,Affordable Alternative,"The Reusable K-Cup is a very good, affordable alternative to the one-cup disposable K-Cups. We enjoy it because we can use our favorite coffees that aren't available in K-Cups, like some Starbucks brews or other gourmet coffees we enjoy! Ours came with our Cuisinart machine made for Keurig and has been invaluable thus far! No issues with breaking like others have mentioned... and we use it often!Tip: The Reusable K-Cup doesn't usually brew as strong of a cup as the disposables. But, we buy coffee beans to grind and find that grinding the coffee superfine (espresso setting) and filling the K-Cup with that brews a satisfying cup!"
4,Water leaking,"As another reviewer has posted the water leaking problem with the reusable filters is easily solved. Get a small 1/2"" or so fiber or plastic washer with a hole size that fits over the needle in the Keurig brewer. 1/16"" thickness or a little less is good. Slip the rubber sealing washer off of the brewer needle (found in the top with the brewer open). Slide the fiber washer over the needle and then put the original rubber seal back over the needle. Don't worry if the rubber sits slightly over the slots in the needle. When the brewer is closed on the reusable filter the rubber is depressed to make the seal and fully exposes the slots. Works perfectly and no more water leaks. The coffee gets more thoroughly soaked with water and brews a better cup. I use just regular Maxwell house coffee and it works fine. It seems to work fine using the K-cups as well."
2,Metal filters aren't so good,"I've never seen a substitute for good old filter paper. The metal coffee filters, whether for the Keurig or any other make, produce a ""muddy"" cup of coffee, marginally acceptable at best. So I should have backed off when I saw the metal filter in the My K-Cup. However, if one is wiling to compromise on coffee quality, the My K-Cup is very convenient and simple. I have also tried cutting off the cover of a used K-cup, washing out the grounds, filling with my own coffee, placing a piece of aluminum foil over the top and crimping around the edge. The resulting coffee was every bit as good that made using the original K-Cup but it's a lot of work. Next I will try the My Kap lid which will eliminate all that fuss with the aluminum foil. I wish Keurig could come up with a disposable paper filter for their My K-Cup."
5,Excellent Coffee and Affordable!,"Having been a Keurig user for several years now, I am very pleased to have recently purchased my own machine for my home office. The sad looks of neglected regular coffee bags began gnawing at me and my wife presented me with the K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter. Best purchase ever for a coffee addict. Not only does it make an amazing cup of your favorite store purchased blend, but it will also save you quite a few dollars on the investment of ready-made K-Cupped Coffees.I certainly recommend this item as a must for any Keurig owner. The only cons are the amount of time it takes to clean the filter out after each use... so if you're incredibly lazy, just spend the extra money and get the ready-made K-Cups. For me and my money-conscious wallet, the investment has been worthwhile."
5,Keurig resuable coffee filter,This is a great product. It is easy to use and was much less than at the store. I love it.
4,does what it says,"I can't complain. I knew what I was buying and that's what it is. Something ""self-measuring"" would be nice, but I guess they can't think of everything."
5,Product makes K-cup machine affordable and environmentally sound,"I really wanted the ease of the K-cup coffee machine. My husband and I don't like the same kinds of coffee, rarely drink more than one cup, and like to make it fast and take it to go, and we're terrible about cleaning the coffee maker. But K-cups are SO expensive, and create SO much waste. Here's the solution! It works perfectly. I'm getting a few extra baskets so I can reserve two for tea, and keep a couple more pre-loaded with coffee and ready for the morning rush out the door."
2,Stay with the packaged coffee in the K-cups.,"I am not sure if the directions for this little device are accurate. I just love my Keurig, but was hoping to save money by buying my own favorite coffee and using this filter. After several experiments with different coffees, I gave up and put it back in the box.Coffee was strong and bitter as if the filter was giving me the worst qualities, rather than a smooth cup of coffee."
4,My K Cup,Much cheaper than using the k cups you buy in the store. the only bad part is popping it in and out if you alternate between the my k cup and the store bought k cups. overall it was worth the purchase.
1,Stay with the K-cups,"Thought this was the answer to using our own coffees! Boy were we wrong!It was terrible and messy. Back to using the k-cups. That's why we bought the machine, for convenience! Amazon has great prices on k-cups so it is a no brainer."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Don't waste your money on the filter or the Keurig Coffee Maker. I was using fresh ground french roast coffee and after brewing all I had was a cup of weak tastless coffee. I returned both the filter and Keurig Coffee Maker. I'm now back to using my 4 cup drip coffee pot and enjoying a strong cup of coffee.
1,Weak coffee,"I was excited to find this filter because I love Dunkin Donuts coffee, but also love the convenience of being able to make just one cup of coffee at a time in my Keurig coffee pot. I was sure that this was going to be the best of both worlds, but it wasn't. I'm not sure what the difference is in using the reusable filter and the pre-packaged K-Kups, but when using the reusable filter the coffee is very weak. It looks like dirty water, not coffee. Each time I used the filter I used more coffee, but the coffee was always as weak as dishwater. In looking into the filter after brewing, the majority of coffee was just pushed to the side, and the water flowed straight through the middle, leaving just a small hole in the coffee, while most of the coffee was untouched. I am very disappointed in this product."
4,Excellent Althernative,"Although the reuseable coffee filter isn't as convenient as the ready-to-use K-cups (that's why I've rated it 4 instead of 5), it's a much less expensive alternative that works well. I originally bought the reuseabel filter because I had received several gift bags of ground coffee for Christmas from Starbucks and Green Mountain and didn't want them to go to waste.To use the reuseable filter, you simply fill the filter with about two tablespoones of coffee grounds, put the filter in the base and screw on the top. Then pop out the base coffee holder from the Keurig, which takes one finger and every little effort, and replace it with the reuseable filter rig. Brew as normal. No grounds get in your coffee cup!When it's done brewing, unscrew the cap from the reusable rig, dump the used coffee grounds, and rince the filter. It's that easy! And while it's a few more steps than using the prefilled K-cups, it's a much more economical way to use the single-serve Keurig coffee maker."
1,Third Filter In Less Than A Year,"It is sad that the Keurig My K-Cup Reuseable Coffee Filter is such substandard in quality. I just ordered my third one since January 2007! I like the convenience of it and don't understand why it can't be made out of a better material, like stainless steel. It cracks, and splits too easily. I am glad the coffee maker is nicer, because I would not be buying any Keurig products!"
2,Coffee Grounds,"It's just Okay, no i would not purchase it again because the only reason I did not sent it back is because the shipping cost more than the product, not worth my time. I would not reorder or recommend this product unless you don't mind the coffee grounds in the bottom of the cup. :-( I order this for my son, so far he has not complained, maybe it doesn't bother him. I don't know"
1,Good idea that doesn't work that well,Bought for my wife who prefers her own coffee brand. The grounds always get in the coffee. Gritty texture to coffee.
3,questionable,I was disappointed to learn that I would have to dismantle the k-cup assembly on my machine in order to use this coffee filter - I am not sure how much I will use this if it is that much trouble.
3,Works if you have a home brew,This is a great product if you have a home brew system. Why doesn't this work for the office brew system? We are all trying to safe money but no you have to buy the pre-packaged cups in the store...Annoying.
5,Create Dunkin Donuts K-Cups!,"We love Dunkin Donuts coffee, yet it isn't available in K-Cups, so we make our own - using this My K-Cup reusable filter.It holds up much better than reusing the paper lined k-cups with the plastic plug. No problem with grounds getting into your coffee.Saves money too! You can use your favorite brand of coffee for pennies instead of buying the pre-filled k-cups.Give it a try, it works for us!"
2,I'm not feeling the love,"I can understand why people like this product and why there is a need for it. I just don't care for how messy it is, pretty much defeats the purpose of the Keurig machine in the first place. OK I know that there aren't any Keurig coffees that have the intensity of Charbucks but I have a better suggestion. Use the Keurig to supply the hot water and put your fresh ground in a press pot. You will get a better cup that way and you didn't have to buy this thing."
4,dont overfill the reusable kcup,i have used my reusable k cup filter for 2 years--no problems. the directions that came with mine said not to put coffee grounds past 3/4 capasity. so thas what i do--BAM the part lasts and lasts and brews for 3.1 cents a cup. here is the reason---dry coffee grounds expand about 24-30% when you add hot water for brewing--no folling. ask the cook at joes diner or observe your coffee filter from your old drip mr coffee maker. a little tip from the Rocket Science guy that went to public school when they were funded properly.----and i never fell asleep in psysics class.
2,If you like grinds in your coffee...,"For those wanting to be more environmentally conscientious while still enjoying their Keurig coffee maker, you'd think this would be an exciting find.Great idea. Not so great in reality.This pretty much eliminates the convenience of using a Keurig, and in many ways is more messy and cumbersome than a regular coffee pot. Grinds inevitably make their way into the coffee cup, and cleanup is not a snap.For those who only have one cup of coffee in the morning, maybe the hassle is worth it. But I doubt any multiple-cup drinker will want the bother.Because k-cups don't lend themselves to recycling, and because this reusable coffee filter is more bother than it's worth, I've gone back to my 4-cup Black & Decker and am much happier."
3,Easy To Use BUT....,"I bought one of these reusable filters with the intent of using some of my favorite Starbucks blends with my Keurig Coffee Maker. Although it is easy to use, I found it a bit too messy after just popping in a K-Cup for over a year.It's doable, don't get me wrong, but I think I'm just spoiled with the K-Cups."
4,New version seems sturdier than the original,"The new, gray-colored holder seems sturdier than the original (dark brown) plastic holder, which had a tendency to crack and for pieces to break off after only a few months of occasional use. I'll post back in a couple of months when I have run it through its paces."
1,poorly designed,This substitute for K-cups is very poorly designed. Use it a few times and you get coffee ground and water all over the place. The tabs don't hold up! It's not over tightening the lid as there is no stop. Keurig blew it on this one!!!
3,Coffee Not Strong Enough,"The installation was a breeze, and I eagerly awaited an environmentally sensitive cup of coffee with the basket instead of the K-cup. The coffee wasn't nearly as strong as the K-cup, and I've tried different grinds. I've tamped it down to get more coffee in, and still no luck getting a strong cup of coffee, even with the smaller cup size. Later - a fix makes this better. Put the basket into a used k cup. It runs through more slowly and is better."
3,"It's okay, but.....","I used my own Starbucks coffee in this and I thought it didn't taste like a real cup of coffee,it was weak. It seemed to waste a lot of the coffee because the hot water didn't reach all of the grounds. The idea is great, but could use some improvement."
1,Poor design...,"The product leaks when used. I know there's ways to fix the issue, but the problem is a company designed and sold a product that was unfit for market. There's no excuse for that."
1,Inconvenient!,It is a hassle to have to remove the keurig bottom cup every time one wants to use this filter.
1,epic fail,in my opinion the little mini k cup does not work very well at all. The coffee we got tasted liked tar through that device
1,weak coffee,"I guess this could be OK if you like weak coffee, but I tried multiple times to brew a decent cup and each cup was tossed. The water seems to come out a lot faster than when you use this, so it's just not steeped enough. In one sentence, the coffee is weak and you have to clean the counter after because it spits the water everywhere."
2,Does Not Live Up to the Keurig Name,"I will start this review by mentioning that I purchased this contraption to brew coffee and not tea. For brewing coffee it is absolutely useless. My 3 chief complaints are as follows:1.) It makes incredibly weak coffee.2.) It leaves grinds in the coffee. This is due to the design. The water enters the device, pushes the coffee to the side,and then begins to splatter off of the plastic at the bottom. The splatter causes grinds to run down the side and into the cup.3.) It is incredibly messy. You better have a garbage disposal because a lot of grinds are going down your drain.For tea, it actually works well. This is the reason I rated it two stars instead of 1."
1,Frustrated - allows water to come through while coffee is coming through,"I would have thought this would have been a perfect filter fit for the Keurig machine, since it is also made by Keurig. However, this filter cup does not fit snugly at the bottom. Therefore, water comes through on the side at the same time the coffee is dripping through the middle. In fact, more water comes through than the coffee; causing a mess and not a true flavorful cup of coffee. FRUSTRATED!"
1,Did not work well!,"I was so excited to get this home and to be able to use my favorite coffee which does not come in a Kcup. I closely followed the instructions and made my first cup. What a mess. The mud came out the top of the device and spread itself all over the place. OK, I must have done something wrong. I cleaned it all up. Started over and tried again. Same dissappointing results. Great idea, but it appears that the coffee quickly plugs up the filter and everthing comes out the top. I would not recommend this product."
2,"not yet deliverd, double charged for filter",Hi i have not yet received the goods but have my mastere card charges showing that i have been charged for 2 filters while the consolidator only received 1 which was packed with the coffee brewer for on fowarding to me. Will you return the charge made for the xtra filter to my master card account. thanks m peake
1,KEURIG BAD CUPS,THIS THING IS WAY TO BIG FOR MY KEIRGE MACHING UNBELIEVABLE DONOT PURCHSE THIS FOR YOUR ONE CUP KIERGE MACHINE YOU'LL BE SORRY
5,Keurig Reusable Coffee Filter,I have not used the filter yet...I'm having too much fun trying the variety coffee k-Cup package.
1,My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter LEAKS. Horrible!,Just purchased My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter for my new B-40 machine. The reusable filter leaks big time! It seems that the water overfills the filter and leaks around the housing. This thing is a waste of money! In fact the entire Keurig coffee maker is way over priced and the quality of the single cup gourmet coffee is aweful - this is why I purchased the resuable filter. Stay away from Keurig products!
1,Unable to remove holder assembly from Keurig,"I can't get the original holder assembly out of the Keurig machine at work!! I've tried for 2 days while using the instructions that came with the filter, and can't get it to move. Maybe you can't use ""My K-cup"" with ""industrial"" Keurig machines(?) (I can't find the model number on the machine or I'd post it here)"
1,Way overpriced,I don't get it. You can get this on the Keurig web site for $14.95 and here it is over $40??????? What gives>
4,Worth using to save money,"I was given a Keurig as a gift and loved it. However, paying for the K Cups over time was really getting out of hand - and the thought of sometimes paying $1 or more per brew for an at home brewer wasn't appealing. One reason I never bought the thing to begin with. But, then I discovered the My K Cup coffee filter. It was pricey but I weighed the options - continue spending $1+ a day minimum to buy the little plastic cups or buy this thing for ~$20 and use my own coffee. Obvious answer. Unfortunately, you cannot add really more than 2 Tbsp which means if you want more than 6oz of coffee it will be watery. I was hoping I could get a 3rd Tbsp in there so I could make the 10oz setting.That's the only downfall I find. That being the only problem, it's a very small problem that I can deal with in terms of saving money in the long run. Overall, I'd recommend it definitely!"
2,Not really worth it,"It worked well the first few times I used it. However after two weeks of use it has basically fell apart. The filter is not of great quality, or perhaps the high pressure from the hot water jet was too much for it to handle. On a positive note, it was awesome to be able to brew my own personal blends of coffee from caribou, Starbucks, etc. Good concept, just wish it was more sturdy. And it wasn't exactly cheap either."
5,Great product,Great product it beats having to buy K Cups which are very expensive. Thanks for agreat product I enjoy every cup of coffee that I make whenI use the filter.
4,OVER PRICED!!,Don't buy this k-cup filter on this site - the real price is only 14.95!! Bed Bath and Beyond has it NEW for $14.95. Works great though when you want to use your own coffee.
1,coffee buff,"the reusable filter works great, suggestion would be for the manufacturer to produce one made out of stainless steel, the plastic on this unit tends to break off rendering it quite useless."
2,Not practical.,"When I purchased this I didn't take into account the time involved in brewing one cup of coffee. Just thought ""Great, now I can use my Starbucks blend. First time I used it I had to take the k-cup holder out, put the reusable filter holder in, fill the filter with coffee and then brew. The end result did not make my imagined perfect cup, even though I filled the filter to the top. I have decided that if I want Starbucks I will just brew it in my standard coffee maker."
1,The my K-cup doesn't stand up the wear of daily use!,"I love the idea of this product, but the my K-Cup does not stand up to daily use. The product is a poor design and I can almost guarentee that if you use this daily you will need to replace it in one month. The top screws on and notches that hold the top to the body of the filer will crack and break. This causes the my K-cup to loose its seal and water leaks out all over so it makes a mess and a bad cup of coffee. I have had my K-cup since Feburary and I have replace the my K-Cup 3 times already. I just got 3 weeks ago and it broke again today. If you purchase the Keurig brewer just plan on using the ready-made K-cups."
3,Not so convenient,I am pretty disappointed in this product just because it is kind of a process to fill and clean and the coffee usually comes out with grinds in the bottom. Once you have k-cups this is not so convenient.
3,Varies by Brand of Coffee,"While this filter is a huge help for most brands, other brands don't work so well. We've used Dunkin Donuts, Seattles Best and Folgets, all with success and good tasting cups of coffee. For some reason, Starbucks is not very compatible. It leaves lots of sludge and grit in your cup and gives off a burnt taste. We lowered the water temp as we read somewhere, with no change. We tried to surround it by a paper filter and while this worked for the first several times, it created pressure issues and water and coffe would go all over the counter as it dribbled out rather than a steady stream into the cup. It looks like we will either be using specific brands of coffee only if going back to Kcups."
3,grounds,"I was excited to be frugal and the ability to choose my own coffee before I received the reusable single cup filter. Disappointed with how this product is contstructed. It allows coffee grounds to dispense into the brewed cup and creates a mess to clean surrounding the filter holder. Additionally, the coffee turns out weak. Hope there will be an upgrade soon."
1,"Filter is not worth 17.99, does not work with machine out of box",I hate that I have to use an old k cup filter make this thing work- other wise hot water and weak coffee go everywhere
1,Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter,"Product doesn't work, water leaks from it and sprays all over the frontof the coffee maker. I would not purchase this particular re-usable filter."
3,"Works well, worth it.","It does leak a little bit out of the side but close enough to the dispenser so the extra water makes it into my coffee cup. However, it is worth it because of how expensive K-Cups are, I'd rather by my own coffee on sale and use this."
2,could live without it,"We love our keurig and this works like its suppose to but does get annoying to have to empty it after each use, especially if having more than one cup or serving coffee to others."
3,ehhhh not the best constructin quality,this is a neat invention and helps save money on the pretty expensive little k-cups but i cant help but notice that the quality just isnt up to par for the price. i had to go and buy another one so i was a little disappointed
2,Messy and a hassle,"I got this for my Keurig coffee maker because I was tired of spending so much money on kcups...this way you can buy your own cheaper coffee and use it in keurig. It is a sloppy mess. The grounds get in the your coffee, it is a mess to make more than one cup. You have to clean the filter from the last use, gets all over the place, etc. Better to have an old fashioned coffee machine instead of using this method for a keurig."
1,Horrible,"This was not worth the money I paid. It overflows, makes a huge mess, and leaves coffee grounds in the cup. I do not recommend this item."
2,Not worth it.,"The short version:This product is expensive and does not work very well.The longer version:When I found out about this product, I was excited. I loved my Keurig coffee maker, but the k-cups were very expensive. So after seeing this, I purchased it. I was hesitant to pay $15 for it, but I did.After taking it home, I immediately filled it with some of my favorite coffee grounds and brewed it. The first problem is that this thing is really messy. After the first brew, it got coffee grounds all over the place, without being filled that high. After looking at the coffee it brewed, I could tell it was going to be weak, and it was. On top of that, lots of coffee grounds leaked into it, making it all the more unpleasant.I then read the review (the second highest rated one) that gave a recommendation for stronger coffee. I tried the method, and it helps somewhat, but the coffee still is not up to par.They need to remodel this product. As it stands, it's not worth the money."
5,Should have gotten this sooner!!,"I love my Keurig, but this little baby made me love it even more. In between waits for deliveries of K-cups, now I can enjoy my own coffee with My K-cup! It's great! And it's dishwasher safe too. LOVE IT!!"
1,Leaks water,"I have purchased two of these and both have an issue with water coming out--its like half coffee and half water which drips out everywhere and just wont work right. I have a friend who has one and says hers works fine. So I am not sure if it is my coffeemaker, me or just two defective k-kups so far?"
4,Don't overfill!,"So after reading all the reviews and trying to stuff as much coffee into these things as possible, by chance I discovered the secret to getting good, strong, coffee out of this. Do not overpack it! Just fill the cup loosely to close to the top, put the lid on and away you go. I think when you overpack it water just doesn't get in there and ""brew"". By leaving it loosely packed the coffee grains get a good soaking. This thing is great, I love it and can use my own brands of coffee, highly recommended."
2,stick to k-cups,the other reviews were correct. the coffee is very weak and the grounds get into your coffee. I always have a lot of 'sludge' at bottom of cup and alot of grounds in my coffee. I'll pay more for the k-cups to get a better cup of coffee. This design needs serious tweaking
5,quality unit.,"After tiring of the clean-up issues of a French-Press coffee maker I was using, I looked to the Keurig unit. Turns out my daughter had been given one as a gift, but has since sharply curtailed her caffeine intake, and gave me hers. While using the pre-packaged K-cups is the ultimate in simple, no-fuss coffee-making, sometimes (being known for my coffee-loving ways), I'll receive a bag of ground coffee as a gift. This little filter is just the ticket to enjoying a fresh, hot cup of quality coffee, and is much easier to clean than the French Press unit. Now, I just need a quality coffee-grinder, because buying the whole-bean coffee provides an even fresher experience."
2,Doesn't work that great,Great idea but didn't work that great in my Keurig mini. Coffee grounds spilled into the cup and water comes out all around the filter. Disappointed in the product.
2,Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter,I did not like it or maybe it was me who never got the hang of it. I want a resuable filter for coffees I used to buy before the Keurig. I am debating buying a Ekobrew Cup Refillable Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewers. It has a ton of great reviews.
2,Keurig My K-cup Reusable Coffee filter,"This product works ok, but the problem is that it leaks with more than one stream and misses the cup. There is always water to clean up. Can anyone recommend one that doesn't leak?"
2,K cup reusable,"When using this filter I place a small pitcher below the spout as there is no telling where the water will spurt out! Have tried less coffee, etc.Any ideas?"
2,this is a joke,"If you like a weak cup of coffee, well your in for a treat with the my k cup reusable filter. The design allows water to flow through to fast. The result is weak, terrible coffee. And you will ALWAYS find lots of grounds in your cup as well. What a mess.I prefer my kaps. Much better solution to using your own coffee."
4,It works like a charm!,"I have not had any problems with this filter whatsoever. The first time I tried it I had a perfect cup of Folgers coffee. I filled it to the top and it came out the perfect strength without any grounds in the coffee or water spilling out. I did not do anything special, so I'm not sure why other customers are having so many problems.I removed one star because the cleanup is a pain in the butt. The coffee grounds are a wet mess to clean from the filter. Because of this, I won't be using the filter daily but when I run out of K-cups I will definitely use the filter."
4,K Cup,It Looks like threads on the cap of device is fragle so am handling gently so as not to break.
3,good try,"They work ok.....but are not tight like the real thing,so this causes some splattering....but it is a good idea and allows us to use our own coffee at a significant savings...so worth the price. THE SHIPPING HOWEVER WAS UNACCEPTABLE AND JUST PLAIN RAPE...$23 for two small items that were less than $3 each......go figure"
3,My K-Cup,First time I used it coffee grounds poured out of this cup and made a small mess. Don't think its design is the best. Won't be using it unless I put the paper filters in it. Would suggest others check out other options.
4,Works as desired.,Coffee grounds sometimes don't like to all rinse out but overall would recommend this purchase. I will most likely purchase a second one.
3,Solved the leaking problem,"Easy solution to stop the leaking...Buy one of those black or brown thick pony tail holders that Goody makes (drug store, etc.) Not the skinny ones.... You then put it on the outside of the replacement holder. After you put your filter basket in and screw the lid on, slide the pony tail holder up to the bottom of the lid. This raises the entire holder up closer to the needle. Stops leaking! The pony tail holder can stay on to use over and over again."
4,After the quick fix with water issue.....your good to go!!!!,I was so sad the first time I used this...water sprayed everywhere and cup of coffee sucked...BUT I read a previous reviewer telling you how to fix the problem and it worked!!!! No mess and no coffee grounds in my coffee. The fix is so simple. Yes....you probably shouldn't have to adjust anything for this to perform properly (which is why I give it 4 stars) but really it's not that difficult. Just open the top where you would place the k-cup and if you look up under the lid where the needle is (be very careful)...there is a rubber washer. Pull the washer down just a bit and there ya go..water problem solved. It seems that the rubber washer need to seal properly against the top part of the plastic lid when in the closed position.Hope this works for you too!! Now I don't regret getting this item!! woohoo!!!
1,"Love my Keurig, hate this reusable coffee filter","A hassle to use and clean, makes a mess, sprays coffee everywhere, and water drips from the unit during use. Also makes a very weak cup of coffee, with grinds at the bottom. We love our Keurig, but I guess we'll stick with the pricey disposable K-Cups."
4,keurig reusable filter,"i use your product two or three times aday, i save money and can use my own brand of coffee. one improvement you could make is paper filter to go inside this filter for easer clean-up ."
1,Where is my coffee!!,"Not quite happy with this thing.. Initially I thought the ground is not the right kind, but it is the same with different grinds I have tried.What you get is a1. Mess2. Weak coffee.3. which gets luke warm by the time U are ready to enjoy it.Stay clear of this product.Yet with so may encouraging reviews.. I am still sure I may be doing something wrong..."
2,Needs a re-design,"A reusable filter is a great idea, but this one is poorly designed. Little bits of plastic from the latching mechanism break off over time, no matter how carefully I make sure that no extra grounds are present that will increase the pressure. Perhaps they overestimated the strength of the plastic, or underestimated the forces on it. Seems like an easy re-design, just increase the thickness of the plastic bits that hold on the lid -- I would be very impressed if they would fix it."
3,Consider it Semi-disposable,"As others have said, this is poorly made. The flanges that hold the cover on will break off, no matter how carefully you use it, after barely several months of once-a-day use. It makes decent coffee when filled 3/4 full, though this means you use more coffee than the K-Cups provide - it is simply less efficient. Look at it as a $5 a month expense and you may consider it worthwhile."
2,On my 3rd filter...breaks easily!,"I like the product, but hate that it breaks so easily. I'm on my 3rd one! The top plastic breaks off making it completely unusable unless you want coffee grounds in your coffee."
2,Disappointed,"With nothing in the enclosed literature to recommend what grind coffee to be used, I used my regular, off-the-shelf coffee as well as a fine grind of special blend only to have the same result...water seeping around the perimeter of the coffee distribution area of the coffee maker, missing the cup and making a mess. When I called regarding the problem, I was advised that coarse grind coffee is what should be used with the reusable filter. Haven't checked that out yet."
5,Yes I AM Cheap!,"I loved my Kuerig when I got it as a gift but when I saw the price of the coffee I could not fathom why anyone would want one of these coffee makers. This product makes it affordable to own an instant brew machine. I love it. The filter is easy to wash and although they wear out buying a new filter is cheap and affordable. I use my machine because of this product all the time now.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
1,Quit working after 4 months,"I'm sorry, Keurig. This product is too expensive to have to throw away after 4 months use.I got the filter last Christmas with my Keurig. Started using it right away. It took about 4 months and the filter plugged up so bad it could not be cleaned. I even tried using a toothbrush to dislodge the blockage but had no success.The screen material is too fine. Moral of the story is, if you're going to use this a lot... expect to have to replace it soon."
2,My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter,"I saw this product as a great way to use coffee not offered in K-cups, read some reviews and ordered one. Once it was delivered I set it up to brew and the first pour started to leak water, so now back to do more research. Found some hints unfortunately they did not help much. So what I am stuck with is a weak cup of coffee with a wet counter. [...]"
1,Don't waste your money on this,Worthless. Make sure you have a roll of paper towels handy to clean up the counter top and coffee maker after using this poor product.
2,Weak Coffee,"I was hoping to be able to control the strength (espresso or close to it) of my coffee by not having to purchase the K-Cups which are fairly good if I use the ""bold"" selections but seem to be rather pricey. I've ground my coffee from coarse to ultra fine, packed it loose, packed it firm, cussed it,talked nice to it, and still ended up with hot brown water.My next attempt to get decent coffee without having to purchase the K-Cups was to order a Perfect Pod Ez-Cup holder and a healthy quantity of paper filters.That review is forthcoming.Help me, anyone?"
4,"over all, great product","works great. sometimes spills a little water out of the sides, but not a big deal. much better than buying k-cups everytime - saves alot of money!"
4,"in general, we like it","For finely ground coffees, it does allow a bit of residue into the coffee. But it's a much more economical way to have a single serve coffee."
1,does not fit,doesnt work DOES NOT FIT WILL NOT FIT CANNOT FIT TRYED TO MAKE IT FIT BUT IT DOESNT AND ITS ONLY FOR THE BIG MACHINES
5,Coffee filters,These filters help you save money and try to get the best you can I love this coffee machine but it's very great.
5,Perfect,"This works perfectly for me - no grounds in my cup, no water everywhere, no mess at all and I'm using a plain pre-ground coffee. Reading some of the reviews and comments actually made me wonder if some people were taking the filter cup out of the gray outer housing and trying to use that in the machine's existing cup housing, just because mine works so well (knock on wood) that I can't imagine /understand the issues with ""water spraying everywhere"" that some are having.On top of the ease of use, it brews a GREAT cup of coffee which is noticeably smoother and less bitter than in my previous Cuisinart coffee pot.At any rate, try it yourself if you're curious, maybe you'll be as lucky as I've been!"
1,Big disappointment,"When I tried this, the water splashes everywhere but in the cup, making a small cup of very weak coffee. Keurig customer service says I must use a coarse ground coffee that I custom grind to avoid this. Kind of negates the ""use your own coffee concept"" that it advertises. I tried every coffee in my pantry with same results. Wish I had just saved the $15."
4,keurig single cup coffee of your choice,"We love it! Saves us $$ and we can use any coffee we choose. Also, less environmental impact. The only downside, cleaning out the filter each time but if you let the grounds dry first this is a snap."
2,doesn't last long,"Buy cheap get cheap, only at $15.00 each, I don't consider this cheap!I do like to help out our enviorment by not purchasing plastic K-cups,but what is the difference if I keep throwing away the My K-cup reusable filter! I purchased 2 units and after only 6 weeks of use, both needed to have the rim superglued! This only lasted about another 6 weeks! I use the keurig because I liked not having to clean coffee filters...but I still am! Those little filters still need to be emptied and washed. I am going to try the new pod maker and Keurig pod adapter next. Earth friendly... make up a batch...use and toss!"
5,Make your own,"Got this so all of the coffee that we already have would not got to waste, works great and easy to clean!!!"
2,Disappointed!,I did not like this product. It is very difficult to get in and out of theKeurig and I worry that I will break it. We are not using it.
3,Ok product,This works but it's a pain to clean and when the last of the coffee comes out it kind of sprays the coffee maker. This means that the coffee maker constantly has to wiped down. That is why I only gave it 3 stars
1,leaky and grinds,I bought this with the intention to save money on coffee. the darn think leaks and sprays water all over the place and the coffee is weak and i get grinds in my cup of coffee. so totally disappointed.. going to try the ECO Brew.
3,reusable filter for k-cup,"It does not use all the grounds, just down the middle. I am not that impressed with it. The k-cups coffees are better."
4,Saved the coffee,It's great. My son and I are both coffee drinkers. I like mine weak and he likes a fork to stand up in his. The K-cups are so expensive and this is an affordable solution. No more coffee down the drain.
3,Works well but takes experimentation,"The first several times I used this, I was dissatisfied with the coffee as it came out weak regardless of how much coffee I used. I tried the tip from other reviewers to reuse a used K-Cup and insert the metal filter into the plastic shell. This does produce a stronger flavored coffee. I think going to a finer grind in conjunction with this method should yield the ideal cup but it will take experimentation to find the ideal grind. I have not experienced grounds in the bottom of my coffee so far. It is a bit more hassle to clean up than just using a K-Cup but that's the trade off for using whatever coffee you want. If you do the clean up immediately, it's a lot easier."
4,"Works well, easy to clean","This product is easy to use and works as advertised. I've not had any problems at all with flavor, which was my main concern. I've read that some have had difficulty getting a strong cup from their Keurig machines but I've found that criticism to be unfounded. I use freshly roasted beans from a local coffee shop ground for a french press, they produce an excellent cup of coffee."
1,Junk,"Leaked water and coffee grounds everywhere, no matter how much or how little coffee grounds I used. Complete waste of money, and this filter was the only reason I wanted a Keurig. K-cups are way overpriced."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to purchase this reusable filter... but every time I use it I have coffee grounds in my coffee. It doesn't seem to be as bad with finely ground coffee, but I am still very disappointed in this product."
1,trick to make it work,"just like the other reviews say - out of the box it is horrible - leaks everywhere, weak coffee. Tried what others suggested - move the rubber gasket down and put an empty modified K cup outside the filter - and it works fine! Disappointing that it needs further engineering after you buy it - but at least it does work."
1,REALLY DISAPPOINTED,"I have had my keurig for 3 months & have boasted about it over & over until NOW. I bought the K cup reusable coffee filter & it is worthless. I've followed the directions to the T many times, made variations I thought might improve the cup BUT NOTHING IS HELPING. I will just have to get my traditional coffee maker out again & alternate depending on what coffee I want to drink. Its just like everyone else has said, the coffee has lots of fine to chunky grounds, the water runs straight through making coffee flavored hot water and it is a little messy (but I would be fine with that if the coffee was atleast delicious!). I wouldn't buy it, keurig hasn't figured this one out yet to be worth anyone's money or frustration."
5,My K-cup,"This particular model appears to be made of a different, stronger material from the first plastic version. I used my first My K-Cup extensively for several years before having to replace it. If you like having a freshly roasted, recently ground coffee then you should try this product. It makes keeping the spent grounds for composting much easier than packaged K-cups. It only adds about 30 seconds of prep time to your cup of coffee over the packaged K-cups. I am well satisfied with the quick delivery and apparent improvement in the product."
1,sad waste,"Bottom line, it doesn't work and the coffee it makes is watery and full of coffee grounds. I looked up tips to try and prevent it from overflowing but nothing works. My friend uses ecobrew and loves it...this product has three parts to clean and doesn't work. Ecobrew, one part and works. Don't try this one, just look at the complaints on youtube :P Save your coffee, time, and money."
2,Doesn't Work,This is a wonderful concept so that you don't have to keep buying the little k cups however it doesn't really work. After the coffee is done being brewed and you go to clean the filter there is coffee grounds that were never used. The filter only makes the coffee directly under the stream of water. That being said it is a hassle to clean and coffee is wasted and your cup of coffee is so weak that it tastes like coffee flavored water.
2,Bad Cup of Coffee,"Bought a new reusable K-cup and was looking forward to a good cup of coffee that I didn't come from expensive K-cups. The cup of coffee is weak. I tried it will all different levels of coffee in the filter, including multiple times at the recommended level. There is no getting around it, this product produces a bad cup of coffee."
1,Weak Coffee and Messy,"This product was a waste of money, The water goes through it way too fast, and the coffee is weak with grounds in it. I tried using the plastic piece and it helped somewhat, put the coffee was still weak."
1,Coffee Overflow,"The problem is that there is no seal when the water goes through the coffee. The force of the water causes the water to overflow from the coffee, and the at times the coffee grounds can overflow too. It took too long for me to figure this out, I have bought a new brand of filter cup to see if it is any better."
1,"Coffee grounds go everywhere, doesn't work well","I don't know if I am not using this correctly, but no matter how I try, it doesn't seem to work very well. I've tried filling the little mesh cup to all different levels of fullness, and it still seems like it blows the coffee grounds out over the edge and in to the cup. I've made it too full at times, and then the water doesn't even get to the middle of the coffee in the mesh cup, it's still dry when I dump it out. It's very frustrating for me. Now I stick to just using the pre-made K cups and I have no problems."
1,Not good for coffee drinkers,"If you drink more than one cup of coffee a day, this is not for you. It's a real pain to clean out. It is next to impossible to clean it without making a mess of the kitchen and yourself.It is, however, good for tea drinkers."
1,This thing leaks,I purchased this item in November. Attempted to use it upon receipt. Leaks water all over my Keurig coffee pot.
1,Very weak coffee,"Won't use this filter system again. It came with the Keuriq, from QVC. Not worth a penny."
2,Maybe it's me,"Maybe it's just me, but I cannot get it to work. It makes a huge mess and clogs each time."
3,not bad ok for the purpose.,"it serves the purpose but the quality of the coffee made is ok, also little messy during the final brewing process."
1,Poor product,"Just like the others have said. they plastic tabs on the lid break after a very very short time. I got the keurig unit as a christmas gift, so i probably used mine a dozen or so times, alternating back and forth between the k-cups. i'll have to rethink my everyday usage of this unit if i have to keep replacing this filter. I guess Keurig really wants you to keep over paying for their ""patented"" K-cups.UPDATE: I did contact Keurig and after giving them my coffee maker model number they sent me 2 replacement units."
5,How to fix the water spraying ISSUE,The first time we used it water shot out everywhere and coffee grounds ended up all in our cup. I decided to call Keurig customer service at 1-866-901-2739. He told us to pull the o-ring down about halfway on the needle that was in the lid. That fixed it now its perfect.
1,Only lasts a couple of weeks,I have gone through 3 of these and they are not made well. The tabs on the top of it start to break off no matter how careful you are when twisting it together. They need to come up with a better design.
4,Great Idea,"After I ran out of my K-cups I went ahead and bought this about a month ago. Being a coffee-lover I enjoy the fact that I can try unique coffee that keurig may not carry, plus, this allows me to save money instead of spending around $10 for a package of K-cups. the filter was very simple to install and I have not had any problems with coffee grounds getting into my coffee. I am unsure what people are doing, but the only thing I can think of is make sure you screw on the filter/holder top before placing the whole thing in the keurig. I typically fill my filter about 2/3-3/4 of the way full. Also, I use it with the keurig elite special edition. Works great!The reason why I didn't give this 5 stars was because cleaning the filter is a bit of a hassle; the coffee grounds stick to the edges and it takes a minute to clean, but other than that it's terrific."
1,"Terrible product, Cracks in a few weeks","Good idea but poorly executed. I've bought three of these, hoping each time for an improvement, but they have all broken after a few weeks of normal use. The plastic breaks down from the heat of the coffee maker and begins to crack and chip. The cap becomes loose and may fail to seal. This a widely reported flaw in the product and can be corroborated by searching online. The manufacturer has not responded by improving the product even though they are aware of the problem and will send you a replacement if you write them. Unfortunately, the replacement will also fail in a few weeks. Its expensive for a poorly engineered product and undermines the environmental aims of reusable filters. Recently, a better alternative (Solofill) is being sold through Amazon and I can vouch that the quality is much better than the My K-cup. Keurig is generally a fine company but My K-cup is a blemish on their reputation. Buyers beware."
2,Dissapointed,"I can not see how this product gets good reviews! I have followed directions and filled it with an appropriate amount of coffee, yet it is extremely messy. Coffee grinds get everywhere and the Keurig machine gets covered in splashes while coffee drips everywhere. I have to wipe down the machine and countertop everytime that I use this product. Also, there is sometimes coffee grounds in the coffee, however, this is not a big issue. This product recieves two stars becuse it makes a decent cup of coffee but is such a hassle to use.Would not buy again."
2,Not Ideal for the B30,"Given the other positive reviews on this product, I have to believe that this review is exclusive to the B30 Mini. For the B30 Mini, the reusable filter is not that great. The water drills through the center of the grinds and then lifts them up to the top of the filter basket (like a cork). It then passes pretty cleanly through the bottom filter mesh. The end result is an extremely weak cup of coffee.I think if they made the basket with a single small filter hole in the bottom (like the punctured disposable k-cups) instead of the full mesh basket, the water might have a better chance of brewing with the grinds. Keurig was probably worried about overflow in that instance.Again, this is only a review of the filter basket's use with a Keurig Mini B30. Other models may have better luck."
5,Also Works With Keurig B-70 System,"The reusable K-Cup filter assembly allows you to use your own gourmet ground coffee in your Keurig brewer. Simple to use and clean, highly recommended. Also works with the new Keurig B-70 Gourmet Single Cup Home Brewing System that was released October 1, 2006."
5,For your Favorite Choice of Coffee - This is a must accessory,"My office has the Keurig coffee system. I bought the filter so I can use my choice of coffee. The Pods available on the market was very limited. I am not saying that the companies who made the Pods produced bad coffee, but I, as many other people, like their own brand and strength of coffee. The problem with the pods was the fact that they were premeasured to taste of someone else.This filter solves this issue. Everyone in the office was able to bring their own brand of coffee, and we really enjoy the Keurig coffee system. If you have the Keurig system, I would strongly recommend that you add this accessory for better enjoyment of your system."
3,"Serves it's purpose, worth the money","Can be a pain to clean out, obviously hot right after brewing..So if you want to do multiple cups, one after the other...Don't expect too much, you have to work for it. Can be a pain to clean even later on, and after you get used to the kcup convenience, brewing coffee from grounds seems like so much work lol. It does give you the ability to use up your grounds though, and can also brew a stronger cup, more than the average kcup will allow..So for that reason, it's worth the money, just don't expect to be blown away."
3,My K-cup fix,"The My K-cup leaks outside the coffee cup. The problem is that the rubber grommet around the sharp pointed piercing tube does not protrude far enough into the recessed hole of the My K-cup lid to properly complete a good seal. A very easy fix. Get some rubber gasket material about an eighth inch thick. Cut a circular piece at 3/4 inch diameter (diameter of recessed hole in the My K-cup lid). Drill a 3/16 inch hole through the center. It will look similar to a garden hose gasket. Just insert this gasket in the recessed hole on the lid of the My k-cup. All done. I used a very small amount of RTV sealant to hold the gasket in place. Once completed, there is zero leakage. With the proper selection of coffee, the reusable My K-cup coffee filter becomes a very economical method to make single cups of coffee. Once this fix was put in place, my rating of the product went from three stars to five stars."
4,My K-Cup fix.,"I too experienced leakage with my ""My K-cup Reuse-able filter"". One of the reviewers suggested adding an O-ring seal to the top of the My K-Cup lid. There is a shallow counter bore that will accept a 3/4"" OD rubber O-ring. The ID should be > 3/8"". The thickness should be between 1/16"" and 1/8"". I couldn't find the exact size so I bought an assortment. I bought the seals at a local large chain builders supply. I found several sizes that work well alone and other sizes that work in combination. So, it appears that the leak is fixed. I haven't seen any sign of cracking or tabs breaking - yet. Got a new, replacement, Keurig B60 coffee maker the other day. It appears to be ""new and improved"" and so far has fixed the leakage I experienced with my ""My K-cup Re-useable filter"". The o-ring is no longer required."
2,Reusable K-Cup Filter - Mostly Water,"Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter 5048 The reusable filter, allows water to flow rapidly through the Kup creates an overflow of about 40% of the water into the coffe cup without the cofee. Results: undrinkable coffee. Tried adapting using a filter paper to impede the flow rate/increase residence time in the coffee, no luck. If this filter requires additional filters (paper) it would have been nice to note that on the package or better in the product requirements before purchase. Very disappointing, Keuring has a great product, was expecting equal quality in the adjunct filter method.I get that the idea is the K-cup, and that there are other products that make single cup coffee less conveniently,guess I should have left well enough alone. The take away: The Keurig is designed to do what it does, probably should be satisfied with the fact it delivers on its product design, forget the reusable filters."
3,A little more complicated than I'd like...,"While this does what it's designed to do very well, it is disappointing that I have to remove the lower assembly from my keurig every time I want to use the filter. There HAS to be better design possibilities that could just fit into the original machine parts! Also, whatever you do, NEVER forget to put the lid on this thing when you brew! It will leave you with a mess inside and out, all over the machine, and no matter how well you think you've cleaned it, you'll find an annoying stray rebel ground in your coffee here and there for the rest of eternity... or until you buy a new machine.(I was tired, it was early, and I hadn't had my coffee yet... and I'm an idiot at times)"
2,"If you want dark coffee, foregt about this one","This is nice if you prefer lightly brewed coffee......But if you like dark coffee, this is not for you.If you lightly load the filter as directed, the grounds are pushed out of the way when brewing. It doesn't give the water enough time to dissolve the coffee. If you pack it tightly, the water can't push through and you get an incomplete cup of coffee (and a mess when you open the carrier and crap goes flying)We experimented with coarse ground and expresso fine ground mixtures, and get similar results"
3,Minor Adjustment Required,I have been able to get My K Cup to work without leaking. There is a small rubber gasket that is at the base of the needle that dispenses the water. Slide the gasket down 1/8 to 1/4 inch so it seals with the My K-Cup. I've heard of people creating a shim so they don't have to keep adjusting the gasket. This worked for me. No more leaking. Good luck!
2,It leaks!,"If you want to make a strong brew, this thing won't help you at all. It tells you to use a coarse grind which produces coffee as light as tea. When you use a fine grind for stronger coffee, it tends to overflow and water drips out of the machine. Its junk! looking for a better one."
1,Junk,This filter does not work! I purchased this filter for emergency coffee when I ran ot of k-cups. I followed the instructions exactly but water and coffee grounds spilled out all over. BIG waste of money!
3,Ehh-It works as advertised but we still don't like it,"This work fine. The problem is the flavor. We have tried our regular drip brand it just tastes awful through this. We have also tried some premium and flavored coffee's. While better, no where near as good as the pre-made k cups. I think it has to do with the size of the grind. The pre-made k cups were designed for and tested with these keurig machines and so have been perfected. No matter what grind we used it was no way near the quality of the k cups but the smaller the grind the better the results in our testing.You may like it better than we do, but the main reasons we don't like it is because it's a bit messy and the quality is not good enough to screw around with it. If you spent over 100 on a brewer a 45 cent k cup should be a non-issue."
2,Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter,"I purchased the reusable filter so I could use my own blends of coffee and obviously to save money by not purchasing the K-Cups. The K-Cup Reusable Filter is a great idea that doesn't work, when the water is running though the filter it leaks out around the top of the filter all over the machine and onto the counter. There is no rubber seal at the top of the reusable filter where the water enters from the machine and that is where the leak is. I would love to have one that works properly."
1,Garbage....do not buy until Keurig addresses design issue,"Got one for Christmas, decided to try this filter with poor results. Tried the cork solution that people have suggested, didn't leak anymore but still got a weak cup of coffee.Keurig needs to address the design issue but I think they'll be slow to do so because other companies are making a bunch of money off of the individual K-cups."
1,weak coffee and grounds,I tried different grinds and amounts I had weak coffee and grinds in the cup every time
2,Not so good,"Re-usable, but result is light and dark coffee.Bought the Ez-cup with paper filters and like it much better!"
2,Keeps breaking,"I've had to continually replace my filter because the plastic around the edges keeps chipping off, probably due to the plastic not being compatible with the high heat from the keurig. Once the edges start to chip, the product will not seal causing the ""leaking"" that everyone complains about. At some point they just get too worn and chipped and the cover will not even stay on. I haven't found a substitution yet for the reusable filter and really don't want to toss out a $100 coffee maker."
3,"good idea, but.....","I read all the reviews on this and even did the recommended ""fix"" with the filter from a Kcup. However, the resulting cup of coffee was filled with grounds. I didn't mind the oily film, but the grounds really bugged me. Now, just trying to salvage it to see if I can make it work!"
3,ok,"This is such a good idea - I wish it worked better. The coffee comes out in multiple jets, some coffee-colored, some clear. I imagine if I could keep out the clear liquid, the coffee would be good - as it is, it's weak. I wonder if I'm using it wrong - it seems so simple though, it's hard to imagine how to experiment with it. I will go back to the reviews to see if someone has solved a similar problem."
1,Doesn't work but that way they'll sell more of the disposable K cups,"This is a great idea and I was hopeful it would work but water spits out from the reusable filter and makes a weak, ground-laden cup of coffee. I called their customer service line and they said they've heard this before and to make sure the rubber gasket at the top of the pin area is pulled down tight--which I did. It gave me the same weak coffee ground filled brew. Don't bother buying this."
3,weak coffee,"You can tell right away, the coffee coming out is very light, almost like water. I see people who are happy with this product have made their own modifications to get decent brew, like using an old k-cup. That tells me the design is inadequate. Simply put, the item does not work as described, hence the low rating. When used as per instructions, this product should produce the same brew you get from k-cup, assuming the same coffee grind, but it does not. It produces a diluted brew that is more like water, not even close to acceptable.Having said that, I love my Keurig machine, but only when using the k-cupsThe fix appears easy, it is in the design of the filter element itself. This needs to be changed to reduced the flow rate thru the filter by 50% of more."
1,Doesn't Fit,"The product didn't fit my coffee maker. I even checked the website and checked the ""does not fit"" model numbers against my machine. It said it fit but is does not fit. This is a drawback as you might understand. I feel sad because of my wasted money."
4,K-cup alternative,"A good aternitive to $.50 K-cups, took some time getting the right amount of coffee to use. Give it a try."
2,I don't like it,"I was really thrilled to be able to use my own ground coffee in my keurig, but to be honest this product is not worth it. Every cup I've had has had left over grinds and silt in the bottom of the mug - yuck. I know it's not that some grounds have gotten outside the filter because I've cleaned it all numerous times, and it doesn't happen when I use a k-cup. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,A must-have addition for the Keurig,I've had this for almost a year and use it four or five times a day. Never had it break or give me any trouble at all. I just rinse it out and let it air dry in a dish rack.With this item you can use any brand or type of ground coffee you choose.....nice not to be restricted to only what's available in super expensive k-cups. Even pricey gourmet coffees are cheaper in ground form than pods or k-cups. This is a real money saver. Also nice that you can adjust the amount of coffee you put in to make a larger or smaller cup of coffee. The reusable filter pays for itself in short order. I'm very glad I bought one.
5,Add this to your Keurig coffee maker,"The K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter completes this coffee system. While we enjoy all the varieties and the ease of the K-Cups, this reusable filter allows us to use other coffees we enjoy that are not available in K-Cups. It is easy to use and easy to clean."
5,Good route for inexpensive coffee on the Keurig,"Good way to use your own brew in the Keurig. I bought it at the same time as my Keurig coffee machine, and honestly have not used it much due to the overwhelming variety of coffees, teas, and even hot chocolate available for the Keurig in pre-made brew cups. But when I do use it, it works well (and using your own coffee is less expensive than the ready-made cups)."
3,Coffee Grounds,"I like the idea of using your own coffee, but did not like the coffee grounds in my cup of coffee. I did not overload the filter."
1,Leaks and doesn't work worth beans,"Thought I'd be sneaky and save some money on my occasional Keurig addiction of Starbucks Pike's Place Roast by making my own K Kups up. This unit leaks badly and just made a mess...I followed the instruction completely as I thought perhaps Id assembled it improperly - no bueno still. I considered shipping it back, but it was so inexpensive to begin with, it just wasn't worth my time and trouble. Ah well, you win some, you lose some (this is, to date, my only Amazon purchase made with buyer's regret). Save you money and just buy the K Kups. Now that the patent has expired, the cost has come way down, so I think i can afford a .75 cent cu of coffee a couple of times a week. =) It did ship fast thought..."
4,coffee,I am very pleased with this purchase Very easy to use in several different sizesI'm very pleased with it
1,Reuseable K Cups,"It was not a well designed product and didn't work, because water would spew out of the Keurig machine instead of making a coffee. I tried to put a empty ""K cup"" in the filter to create a more direct flow of the water, as some reviews suggested. This helped a little, but water still spewed out of the coffee maker. I would never buy this product again unless the design of the product has been improved. Very disappointed."
5,Works Great,"It works perfectly. I can actually make better coffee with this then with the K-Cups. It's easy to clean, just throw the old grinds out and rinse."
1,Poor Quality,The coffee grinds did not properly stay sifted in the reusable K cup coffee filter. All the grinds ended up in the mug with my coffee and I had to throw an expensive batch of coffee out.
2,resusable K cup,Grounds get real dry and are tough to clean out. Makes a weak cup of coffee compared to regular K cups.
2,reusable filter for K-Cup,I am having considerable trouble inserting the holder into the machine. It is too deep for the receptacle in the coffee maker. I have misplaced the instructions which came with the filter - should I remove the black ring in the machine to fit the new filter in?
1,Not happy w/ this one,I purchased this reuseable filter when I bought my Keurig. I love my Keurig but the reuseable filter leaks everywhere and half the grounds end up in my cup. Regret this purchase.
5,Works great and an excellent price.,"This product is convenient when you run out of Keurig cups, keep a bag handy and fill this up with some coffee and it will filter and brew. Coffee ready to go."
1,Grounds abound!,I am doing everything according to the instructions but still get a terrible lot of grounds in my cup! It's just not doing what it says!
4,works great; a little messy; look at the non-Keurig alternative,"works great but can be messy. with this Keurig version, you have to remove part of the machine mechanism. with the non-Keurig alternative you don't have to do this--that one works just like a K-cup"
2,Keurig K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter,"Initially I was excited at being able to brew different brands of coffee. Unfortunately, I end up with grounds in my coffee. I've read the instructions, and have double checked to ensure I'm doing everything properly. The only thing I've not done is to call Keurig directly."
1,There's better out there,"Good idea, but bad execution. I tried this product for a couple of months, and it was more hassle than it was worth...didn't create very good coffee, the grounds often end up in the cup (sometimes LOTS of grounds!), and the water sometimes sprays out in 5 or 6 streams and makes a mess. There's a few little things I've found to make this a tiny bit better, but the bottom line is there's better out there. I tried the Ekobrew unit next, and it works much much better (and I believe is roughly the same price). No hassles, easy to use and clean, makes good coffee at a fraction of the cost of a K-cup. I would recommend buying that instead."
1,Leaky,"Even after meticulously following directions, my husband and I could not get the hot water to stop leaking out the side of this filter. It makes for a very watery cup of coffee and a messy countertop, to say the least. You're far better off sticking with the pods or making coffee in a French press instead. Don't spend the money."
2,Not worth the expense,Coffee brewed is very weak no matter how it is ground. Water shooters a jet through the middle of the grounds and most of the coffee is left dry.
3,"Coffee filter, not so convenient .","Not as easy as we expected, does work, but has it's quirks.... grounds in cup, hard to clean.... but, it works."
2,too much of a pain,"Does it work? Yes, I got my cups of home roasted coffee. Was it worth it? No way. The filter can only hold maybe a tablespoon of grounds and get water through. If you cut and slip in a paper filter, no water gets thru. I pike my coffee strong, so that was a disappointment. Worse, its a pain to clean. You need to spray water and soak it to get old grounds out for every cup. It's faster to use a traditional coffee maker instead. Additionally, be aware that you need to stick your hand in the kcup so be careful to avoid the needle. The most useful thing about this is if my kurig isn't working right, I can pop this in to run just water and see where the clog is."
2,Doesn't Work,After I read the reviews and purchased this product. I expected to have to do the fix using an empty k-cup as recommended by others. I had even saved and prepared the empty k-cup. Unfortunately it was a waste of time and money. After following directions for fix carefully. Coffee was still to weak and grounds still in coffee! I would not recommend this product.
2,Kerig reusable coffe filter,This item does make a good cup of coffe and allows you to ajust for individual preference but is dificult to dump ground out of.
3,"Def worth the money, but one flaw....","As I spent hundred of dollars on K-cups, I sought after a reusable filter. I ordered this reusable filter because I figured Id have to stop spending so much money on the cups. Well, I was right, and wrong. This filter works great, except for the fact that the stream of water going into the filter is too strong, and all it does is basically push the coffee around, and doesnt utilize it properly. So you cant make a different strength coffee by adding more/taking less away, because the water stream just pushes the coffee out of the way. Most of the time when I change the grounds, theyre dry. Glad Ill be saving money by not having to buy 18 packs of cups every other week, but not happy about the coffee thats being wasted."
2,My k-cup,"Doesn't hack it for me, coffee is too weak. I tried all of the remedies on here to no avail. I always wind up with grounds in my weak coffee. I even tried to poke holes in the bottom of an old k-cup and sleeve the inside with a filter. It was a good idea in theory but too much of a pain for something that is supposed to sell itself because of convenience."
3,Keurig Reuseable filter,"The first time I used this filter I had mud in the bottom of my cup. I then cut a paper coffee filter down to about half size and placed it in the filter holder without the mesh screen filter.I placed a heaping tablespoon of my favorite coffee in the paper filter and screwed on the lid. It makes great coffee this way with no mud or no mess. By the way, I leave enough paper filter to go over the edge of the holder before putting on the lid.This is a little more work this way, but it is well worth it if you want to make your own brew.Keurig My K-Cup Reuseable Coffee Filter"
4,Found a way to fix the issue with water splashing everywhere.,"So I bought this filter, installed it, and when I made my first cup of coffee water splashed everywhere and I got a ton of coffee grounds in my coffee. After playing with it for a while and wasting almost 10 cups of coffee, I finally figured out how to fix it.There is a needle on the top that, when the handle is closed, inserts into the hole in the reusable filter. Surrounding this needle is a rubber gasket. Gently pull this gasket down a little bit. Be careful, not to pull it off completely. Once I did that no more mess and better tasting coffee."
2,"A must-have, but very poorly made...buy more than one","Unfortunately you really need one of these things to use your Keurig properly unless you are dedicated to spending lots of money and killing the environment with K-cups. These things last us about 2-3 months max. They are so poorly made that they seem designed to break after a certain time period. I have gone through three so far. The plastic latches that hold the top on just break off and crumble away, no matter how carefully you screw on the lid. Then your coffee spills over the sides when you brew it. However the cost of continuously replacing these things is likely offset by the savings of not using k-cups which are currently overpriced."
5,Reusable K-Cup,The reusable K-Cup for my Keurig coffee maker arrived earlier than promised and works like a charm. I love it!
1,Great item when it works ...,"I bought this item based on the reviews and desire to have more flexibility with my K-Cup coffee maker. While the reusable filter worker well several times, after about my 5th time using it stopped worknig properly -- the coffee overflowed from the filter rather than dripping through the bottom. The result was coffee and grinds everywhere. I am not sure what happened as the unit does not appear to be broken, and I am using the same amount and grind of coffee. The unit that came with my coffee maker lasted nearly a year until it broke. This one appears to be of poorer quality."
1,weak coffee,keurig reusable coffee filter. I tried it five or six times with different brands of coffee. It always came out very weak coffee. There was not enough brewing time using this filter. The pod is stronger.
4,Good idea; not enough room,"Basically the problem has more to do with the K-Cup design philosophy than anything else. The problem is that the K-Cups are just not engineered to hold enough coffee to get the job done, and even this custom basket falls short. These ""open source"" baskets leave more to clean up than with the K-Cups, which defeats (for me, at least) one of the prime purposes of the pod coffee systems. Since they don't hold significantly more grounds than the K-Cups themselves, they (unfortunately) don't serve much purpose. If you like weak, pod coffee then I must say the execution of the custom basket is good and it works as advertised. I tried both Starbucks and Peet's coffees in it and while it worked the coffee still sucked. On the contrary, when I manually brew using the aforementioned grounds life is good."
2,"Great Idea (double-shot!), poor execution - it's fragile.","As someone who ever-so-carefully pried open my used disposable coffee K-cups so I could refill them when I ran out (yuk!), I was a sucker for this product. One thing I really liked is that, if I topped off this reusable coffee filter, I could do a ""double shot"" and get a full travel mug's worth of coffee (drawback of Keurig coffee maker, the portions are soooo small!).What I don't Like: I think they made it of some kind of plastic that's perfectly fine -- unless it gets wet or warm! Like reviewer ""Steve"" of Estes Park, CO, the flange on mine started fragmenting off not long after I got it.However, I consider the product indispensable, so I'm getting another.Tip: Carefully align the tabs with the slots when you screw the top on. Don't Force It! I plan to take much more care with the next one."
2,"Works, but there are better alternatives.","I bought this filter when I bought my keurig and was excited to try it. I love the idea of making individual cups of fresh coffee, but not the cost and waste of using separate k-cups. This filter does it's job but it's very poorly designed compared to some other brands of reusable filters out there. With the keurig filter you have to remove the k-cup housing inside the machine before you can use it. This is inconvenient if you switch back and forth between both a filter and k-cups or if you're short on places to store this part while using the filter. I found that the ekobrew filter cup works way better, plus you use it just like a k-cup so there isn't the extra hassle of removing a part from your keurig machine."
2,"Great Idea, Bad Design","Im a real coffee drinker, as in a cup before anything else in my day and more cups while I work thru the afternoon. Needless to say I couldn't come to terms with my new K Cup cofee maker increasing my coffee budget 3000% so I got this. Im MUCH happier now that Im not paying 60 cents a cup.Problem is, not all the water makes it thru, no matter how I try a lot goes around and down into the cup, plus the 4 hole design at the bottom makes it a splashier brew. Imagine 4 or 5 streams going down into the cup, 3 are coffee and w2 are just clear hot water. Its a bad design and with just a little tweaking, would make an excellent product. But as it stands, the design is just plain bad. but it does the job.Im probably going to buy another one from a different company, it seems 2 or 3 different just hit the market.pros - saves a lot of moneycons - its messy and badly designed."
1,"Does not work properly, and there are alternatives that do work","Don't buy it.While there may be much discussion regarding methods of hacking/tweaking/etc to get this thing to work properly, the simple fact is that it does not work properly out of the box. Adjusting the rubber piece in the coffee maker did not work; and I don't see why I should have hack up old disposable k-cups to get this thing to work. I'm convinced keurig has no intentions of making a working reusable cup because they make the majority of their money on the sales of k-cups.I purchased a Solofill brand reusable k-cup and it works fine. I love my keurig coffeemaker and now I love it even more that I finally have a way to make coffee and not pay for (non-biodegradable) k-cups."
3,Works okay after improvising but it's still a hassle,"I tried the K-cups but really missed my Starbucks, so thought this would be a good solution. I was disappointed with how weak the coffee was--the way this is designed the water is shot directly down the coffee and doesn't hit most of the grounds, losing out on a lot of flavor.I followed other reviewers suggestions and rigged it up by cutting the k-cup and putting the filter in it, which did help some. But it still did not give that ""coffee shop"" quality flavor like a regular coffee maker would give.I just returned my Keurig, since it was more of a pain cleaning the filter and putting grounds in it, to only make a 10oz cup of coffee that filled only half my cup.This may work for some, with the cut k-cup, but they really should just redesign this so it works well as is."
3,Design modification,"Got this item cause KCup coffee was breaking the budget. Thought this would be the solution but no matter the grind or the amount, the cup of coffe was crappy. Just too weak. The water simply went through too fast. So here's the solution I finally came up with. 1. Save a used disposable kcup. 2. Cut it open and clean it out. 3. Cut the top 2/3 of the cup off and throw it away. 4. Insert this into the filter holder. 5. Fill filter cup with coffee and then use as usual. You may have to adjust the amount of coffe you use to suit your taste, but this modification slowed the flow down enough to make a good cuppa. Good luck."
2,You'll get tired of cleaning it pretty quickly,"It's not that the filter is a bad deal or anything, it's just that you're going to get tired of putting the whole thing together, especially if you drink a lot of coffee. I've gone for the K-Cups, myself."
2,Pretty Much A Waste,"I purchased two of these to send overseas to some friends in the military. K-Cups are priced outrageously so I figured I'd get a few of these and they can run normal bean through. The main problem I found was that the filters in these adapters are made about as well as a Sparkomatic tape deck (very poor quality). You see, both units lost their filter screens within the first few cups. Very poor quality...The saving grace was that, as shown in some pictures, you can hack these things to use paper filters. Anyway... I think the idea of single-serving coffee is wasteful and expensive, and these things push the cost even higher. Save your money, by a French Press for $20, and drink good coffee."
2,Wish I could return it,I have a friend who uses it and says it leaks. It's not what I thought I was getting. I bought what I wanted from the grocery store. Wish I could return it!
3,Not as good,"This item is good if you don't need strong coffee, or if you have coffee lying around that you want to use up because it's cheaper than buying K-cups. I used mine once and much prefer just buying k-cups. If you fill it up all the way it still only makes enough strength for a small, maybe medium cup if you don't like weak coffee."
3,On My Third One!,"I have the same problem another reviewer has - one of the rims on the outside of the holder breaks after a time and renders the whole device useless because the top can no longer be held on securely. So I've just ordered my third filter. I wish there was anotoher solution. I'm a Gevalia coffee lover and need this device to make my coffee.Don't get me wrong ~ I love the Keurig coffee maker! Bought it with my blind brother in mind but I use it all the time as a kitchen appliance.From making jello, to plumping raisins, to disolving bouillon cubes, the instant, measured hot water is a great convenience. I just wish they would make a filter that lasts!"
5,I love my reuseable Keurig filter,"My Keurig B60 is wonderful, but I wouldn't love it as much as I do without the reuseable filter. It lets me make the coffee as strong as I want and lets me use the type of tea I prefer which is not offered in a K-Cup. It's easy to use, and it's easy to switch out when I want to use a prepackaged K-cup of coffee,"
3,"They work well, but buy a couple.","Have gone through three of these re-usable filters. I've got to share the opinions of others that they are poorly made and destined to need replaced in two or three months. I think the probable reason for the plastic locking tabs breaking over time is the extreme heat that they are subjected to. Next thing you know, the lid won't snug up and you've got coffee bubbling all over the cup and counter. Having said that, even if you must buy several a year, the cost is still far less than the K-cups. I, myself, prefer Folgers over those cups anyway."
1,Doesn't work with the B130!,"Bought this to be more environmentally friendly. Amazon doesn't tell you that it doesn't work with the B130.Keurig website doesn't tell you it doesn't work with the B130. I guess you are just supposed to be born knowing this.e-mailed Keurig asking them if it was compatible with the B130 and they never deigned to get back to me.BTW, the B130 makes tremendous coffee with the K cups. Too bad the customer experience sucks so bad.Keurig B130 DeskPro Brewing System"
2,Overpriced juck,"I had to be out of my mind when I bought this. It leaks, places grounds in your unit and cup. Do not recommend"
1,Not worth $47!,"This gasdget's not bad.... I prefer the prepackaged cups but I will be using the reusable cup often b/c it's cheaper and better for the environment. Definitely worth having. But not at $47 -- it is criminal for the seller here to be selling it for that much! You can get it and Bed Bath and Beyond for $12 with a coupon, $15 without. I wish Amazon would get rid of sellers that so blatantly overprice."
1,Produces lousy coffee.,"Perhaps it's my fault, but all I get is lousy, watery coffee with these things. (I bought two...) Coffee grinds too fine? Too coarse? Over-filled? Under-filled? Perhaps some experimenting is called for."
2,"Too expensive, and affects drip of machine negatively.","This filter for K-cups is too expensive and does not do anything but create a mess when used. As the coffee perked and came through this item it splashed all over the place (even on a wide mouth coffee cup) and made an absolute mess. I would recommend not even buying one of these and wait until whatever type of coffee you enjoy makes a K-cup version and then buy the seperate K-cups. One of the worst products I have ever bought on ebay....sad to say, but the truth. Very messy and needs a better design for the Keurig machine to eliminate waste and splashing all over the place."
2,disappointed,"This single cup device is convenient but it left me a bit disappointed.After getting used to the kcup premeasured portion cups already filled with coffee,the do it yourself reusable cup proved to be messy. Not only did I find grinds on the outside of the reusable cup after use but there was too much sediment in my brewd cup of coffee as well. Disappointing!"
1,why get a keurig when there is better out there,"i just got a keurig for christmas and it seems to be an expensive toy i bought an expresso machine for $25.00 10 years ago. it makes one big cup of coffee (or cappachino) it has a removable basket that takes seconds to clean . i can fill it with any loose coffee . it can steam expresso it takes less space , but it does not have a timer, i recycle the grounds.and it is alot easier to use than the k-cup reusable coffee filter. i mostly drink tea,to make normal tea doesn't take long, tea is only a few cents ,why pay $.55 a cup for tea, dont be so lazy"
3,It works with some help,"Like others, I have added a faucet washer to the top cover to help the unit seal properly with the coffee maker. In order to reduce the pressure in the system, I use a smaller amount of a stronger coffee. There are subtle lines molded inside the basket that indicate the ""full"" level and you have to respect that and not try to overfill. Furthermore, I have added a few inches of 3/8"" vinyl tubing to the bottom of the unit to control spatter and keep all the brewed coffee going into my cup. You have to dip the very end of the tubing in very hot water before you can push it onto the My K-Cup body. And no, I shouldn't have to do any of this."
3,Not so great,"This item does exactly what it say. However, they fail to mention that, like so many mesh filters, it leaves a layer of sludge at the bottom of the cup. Not my favorite thing. It is easy to insert into the coffee maker, but it is a bit of a chore getting the used grounds out of the filter and then getting it clean. It I had it to do over again, I would save my money."
5,Thrilled,I just brewed my first cup using my reusable filter! I had read in some reviews that it would brew weak coffee - this was not the case at all with me. I carefully packed the filter full to the top (because I was weary of it being weak) and it brewed the strongest cup of coffee I have ever had! I absolutely love this item.
2,Sludge and Sediment,"I bought this and if you do not put some extra filter material in you get sediment and sludge in your coffee cup.Had a senseo before this and that screen worked great, now my coffee cup always looks like I made hot choclate when I get to the bottom."
1,Not user friendly,"Seemed like a good idea, but I think there are better options out there. I don't drink coffee but my wife and her friends had trouble getting this to work consistently. It could be much easier...and I think there are easier options."
3,coffee filter,The coffee filter works fine but after reviewing the item after purchasing it I found the cost to be a little high.
4,Good Filter,"Would have given this a 5 Star rating, but the item was not in the original manufacturers packaging, but in sealed plastic wrap...strange. I saw no imperfections in the product. Arrived ahead of schedule, and was reasonably priced."
1,What a dissapointmnet,"The coffee you get when using the My K-Cup is very weak. Even when packing the cup full with coffee the results were poor. The coffee remained just as weak because the water coming from the keurig is under pressure. This pushes the grounds in the My K-Cup up the sides of the filter, which is what you want. You don't want water in your cup that hasn't passed through the grounds. However the problem is the hole at the top of the My K-Cup does not create a tight seal with the spout in the keurig. The water is forced out the top around the spout and then comes down the inside of the keurig itself. This causes the water to come out at odd angels and completely miss your cup and some times even the drip tray.You can search through the comments for ways to modify your My K-Cup to make it better which I intend to try. Had I known what I was getting into I would have just not bought the My K-Cup."
2,Needs a little work.,"I am not terribly impressed with the My Cup. you'd think Keurig would make a more functional product for it's coffee maker. it leaks all over the place and leaves grounds in the cup. Even with all the problems, the actual cup of coffee tastes pretty good."
2,Not what I expected,It said six on the ad. I must have read it wrong. It is not what I thought it was sorry. My mistake.
2,Would be nice if it fit,"Got this for my birthday - was very excited as I like the coffee I get from a local roaster, but had gone without it after buying my Keurig - tried it today and found it doesn't fit my Keurig machine. After having gone through three home Keurigs in 18 months (pumps kept jamming) I bought a Keurig B145 OfficePro. It's not as fancy, but it's a great Keurig. It has a feature that the standard home models don't, apparently - a partial ring around the area where the K-Cups load, which in this case prevents the My K-Cup from seating properly and also blocks the Keurig from closing. Good thing I bought new K-Cups yesterday.If you have a standard home machine, this should work fine. Just save your receipt!"
2,Makes your coffee taste like plastic,"The My K-Cup was incredibly disappointing. After buying (and loving) my Keurig B40 Elite, I was excited at the prospect of no longer having to shell out 50 cents for mediocre K-Cups. However, the My K-Cup was so bad that I would gladly pay a small fortune for every cup of coffee to never have an experience with it again. After washing it eight times and soaking it in various products, it still smelled the way it did when it came out of the box-- strongly of chemicals and plastic. This would be fine except that it also made my coffee taste like plastic. If you have ever tasted weak, plastic-y coffee with grounds in it, you will understand my pain. This did not get better with time. I have now had the My K-Cup for several months and, like a fool, I keep hoping that if I wash it enough, it will stop making things taste like petroleum. No luck yet. If I were you, I wouldn't risk it."
3,Still messy,"Well, it works, but you have to use a very coarse grind or you will have grounds in your coffee. And it is a bit messy. We got the Keuring to replace a Bunn which was always overflowing during brewing and leaving a mess on the counter, cupboards and floor even when using Bunn filters which are a little deeper. We really don't use this much."
4,I like it!,You will need to purchase paper filters too - otherwise you will get grounds in your cup. Use strong blend of coffee or you may be making weak coffee.
5,Love the reusable filter,This filter is a great way to save money on k-cups and still have a great single cup of coffee.
3,Good coffee but inconvenient,"Cleaning and clean-up is somewhat difficult and nasty.That kind of defeats the whole idea of K-cup simplicity.The filter basket is small, difficult to handle and easily damaged.The filter basket permits considerable amounts of solids into the brew, even with coarse grinds.To get a decent cup of coffee you pretty much have to fill it up. This illuminated why K-Cups are expensive: they use about twice as much coffee per cup as drip brew. Two heaping coffee measures were required to get the same brew I get from my brewerThat said, this is far and a away the best K-cup coffee when packed with your own fresh ground coffee."
2,makes a mess,My reusabel filter leaks water all over the place and also ends up with grounds in the coffee cup. It does not make a good cup of coffee. It seems like the manfacturer could come up with something better. I'm about ready to go back to my old coffee maker because of the cost of k-cups.
5,Work great.,"Fast free delivery, works as advertised and at a great price. It really saves money on purchasing Kcups. What more can you ask for?"
5,Kcup,This came very fast. The only thing was there was no directions in the box so had to get another one to see how to use it.
3,Reusable?,I needed it so I could make my own preference in coffee. It is just ok..just not great. Grounds get in coffee.
3,Review,The coffee isn't as strong going through this system as compared to the disposal cups. Is there a way to make the coffee taste the same?
2,Great idea...needs improvement,"I recently purchased the My K-cup personal filter for my Keurig b70 brewer. After using my brewer for about a month with the regular K-cups I decided to try the My K-cup and found that no matter how strong the coffee I used was my cup of coffee ended up being very weak. I filled the filter to the top with grounds so I had enough grounds in it. This is a great idea for anyone who doesn't want to spend the money on the K-cups, but there needs to be some sort of improvement on the drainage to prevent the coffee from being too weak."
1,Annoying spray and weak coffee,"I bought the My K-Cup Filter so that I could make use of some favorite coffees that are not available in K-Cups. Also thought it would be a more economical solution! After using for one month I find that the brew produced is really weak, even with extra bold coffee. The coffee also sprays all over the place messing up the surrounding area. I tried the Germano solution (see other reviews) which worked very well in solving the weakness problem, however the other problems persist, which, together with the inconvenience of removing the standard filter, renders the item pretty useless. All in all a total waste of money!"
4,Here's the deal,"I know this has been said before, but really, it bears repeating. If you're having a problem with water pissing out of the bottom of the filter and thus all over the counter top and floor and making your life a literal hot mess, then please try the following: Check the rubber o-ring that surrounds the top needle on the Keurig. You're going to have to pull it down a considerable amount. Don't pull it off. Do pull it down to where just the very tip of the needle shows. Then go on and use the filter and you should have no flooding problems. Again, I know it's already been said, and I'd like to thank all of the previous reviewers because y'all have saved me a lot of headaches. Just wanted to bring this point back to the top of the reviews."
4,ok for everyday use,"its ok,but i like the hydrating intense moisturizer better.This is ok for everyday use.Good deal for the size.way better than other salon shampoos i've tried."
4,Very well acted portrait of an eccentric family,"Full of wonderfully acted, beautifully observed moments in the life of anunconventional family, this was called, by one critic, `an Australian `Hannahand her Sisters'. And to an extent that's not a bad description.But this film is messier, less complete in it's vision and less bold in itsstyle. None-the-less, it's still entertaining, moving, and very worth seeing.Bruno Ganz's half French, half German accent is a bit distracting (he's terrific otherwise),and, for me, the ending felt rushed, as if things had to get to a conclusion.It's a film I'd actually wished had gone on longer, or had been willing to leave things lessresolved. Once you start with the messiness of life, you lose something with a lastminute switch to the neatness of movies.Yet another of the ever growing list of good films that are inexplicably unavailableon region 1 DVD."
3,no title,"I didn't think this terrifically good, although the acting was superb. Mostly a character study about two sisters and the husband of the eldest."
4,Surprisingly good!!,"I bought these on a whim when I saw them at a local store, and figured I'd try them out. I just had this rice, and heated up a pouch of teriyaki tuna:Starkist Light Meat Tuna Fillets, Teriyaki, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 10)The combination was filling and tasty, and took a whopping 2:15 total in the microwave. This is something I would buy again!"
2,STINKY PADS!,The size was acceptable for my cat but they leak all over the place. They also drip as you try to dispose of them. I am now using 3 pads at a time which really cuts down on the bargain price!
1,Not as advertised at all!,"I received an item that is not at all what this company shows. The item that is being advertised look like Prevail liners. Prevail have the light green backs. I had originally canceled the order the next day after I placed the order due to not hearing from this company regarding the order..not even a confirmation email. They then sent an email the next day stating that they shipped the order, regardless of me canceling it. I received the box and, in good faith, decided I would keep it. I couldn't belive what I saw when I opened the box. I found these tiny little blue pads, sort of like paper towel material! I have been so ripped off! The package is going back!!"
1,wee weepads,"This is a horrible product. Should not be sold on Amazon or anywhere else as wee wee pad. Very very thin, non-absorbent and is totally not fit for intended purpose. Don't let the price fool you. A lot of the pads even have empty spaces where there should be padding. They are virtually useless."
3,Great for tiny dogs and puppies!,"The price was very reasonable, and they were shipped VERY promptly. They are thinner than the pads from Walmart,but my 1 1/2 pound puppy doesn't mind, lol and they do fit the pad holder from Walmart. Never tried this method of potty training before, but then never had a dog this small before. I flush the fecal matter as soon as she goes and change the pad once a day."
3,QUALITY VARIES,These pads are a hit or a miss... seems like there are two qualities that arrive when you order. one is more sturdy that the other. and since i use these for my dog that is trained to go on a pad i prefer to get the same quality pad at all times
2,not good!,"they r 2 small,dont hold liquid well at all.must use about 4 the liquid 2 hold. so the 300 ,didn't last me at all."
3,You Get What You Pay For,These pads are very thin and work okay for my disabled cat. I would not recommend them for use with a larger dog because they are not nearly as absorbent as other pads on the market.
1,Horrible pads,These pad are thin and not absorbant at ALL. When wet it goes right through the backing. I had to change them 5x as much as the others I have tried.
3,"ok, but very thin","The pads are ok, they have the blue backing and border with the cotton middle.They are the right size and quantity.They are quite thin. Our 5 pound adult dog's urine made quite a puddle that spread out wide and she ended up standing in her pee.Maybe they really are only suitable for puppies, as the name says.I bought them for the cheap price, but I'm not sure they're really going to work for us.They just don't seem absorbent enough."
4,ABSORBANT DISPOSABLE WEE WEE PUPPYUNDERPAD...,For the price you can't go wrong buying these in bulk. They do what they are supposed to and that is to create a barrier between your pet and floor.
3,So so,"Getting 300 pads for the price is a steal, just beware that they are very small and very thin. I have a 15 lb pug and we go though about 10-12 a day. I always have to put down two pads at a time because they are so small."
2,Little absorbant padding,Compared to other pads these were on the cheap side. There's a reason they weren't that expensive (although they certainly get you on the shipping costs). We found them to have a bit of leaking due to the cheap absorbant material.
2,Thin with poor absorbancy,"I guess the price was too good to be true. One small ""pee"" by my Maltese resulted in the entire pad being soaked. Other wee pads are able to contain the urine without it spreading. This resulted in having to change the pad with each void. Never again!"
2,Purchased for my Yorkie !!!,"I have been through alot of different pads, and not downing these, but in my experience, with these and any other pads, you get what you pay for. These do the job, and all the ends are sealed, so that is a plus. On the other hand they are thin, just remember that when purchasing."
2,I luv Amazon,I liked the price of the pads nut they seemed to me to b thin.But buying the tray helped
3,Good enough,"These pads are thinner than the brand name ones, but adequate, especially for the price. We've bought these twice and will continue to do so."
1,Absorbant Disposable Wee Wee Puppy Undepads,"Very disappointed with these pads. Not as absorbant as I am used. The price was good, but the quality wasn't."
2,Not happy with these pads -,"These pads are SMALL, I measured the area where the absorbant part is and it's 12x19 not 17x24. I have to tape two of them together for my pug and it sometimes doesn't absorb quick enough and rolls right off the pad and I end up having to clean the floor. These would be good for a dog 5 pounds and under. They were packed nice and arrived fast but I wouldn't order these again."
3,There's too many best hits collections,"That's right! There's Too Many ""Best Hits Collections"" of these guys. At last count there were more collections of Hooter songs than original albums issued. That's just plain WAKED. I suggest buying ""zig zag"", ""Nervous Night"" and ""One Way Home"" via the used venue here on amazon. This way you own ALL of the great music & YOU decide what their best hits are for yourself, don't let some record industry suit do it for you."
2,Disappointed,"One of the reasons we chose this set over others we saw, was because of the large carrying case that would hold all of the play pieces. However, as soon as we opened the case (for the first time) both of the snaps (that hold it closed) popped off. They can be popped back on, but they always pop off each time it is opened. This poses a problem because my daughter who is very capable of opening similar snaps on toys, can not put them back on herself. So the case is pretty much useless because of how poorly it is made."
3,cheap,"This toy is somewhat fun but it's cheaply made. I bought it for my 3 year old and he opened it on Christmas morning. A couple of hours later, the plastic case had a big hole in it. He had stepped on the side of the case as it was hidden under a bunch of wrapping paper. I expected maybe a crack, but a large portion of the case just fell out. So I put some clear packing tape across the hole so that all of the doctor's tools don't fall through. I think the most exciting thing about this toy is the fake syringe. He likes to go around, pretending to give everyone a shot. You can probably find a better quality doctor kit out there. This one is just ok. It DID arrive quickly though after I placed my order."
3,Nice set in terms of quantity but moderate in quality,"I like this set for the fact that it inludes a lot of doctor's instruments and covers a lot more items than a basic doctor's kit. But quality-wise, I would no way pay anything close to the list price. We got this as a gift, but if I were to buy it for someone, I would buy it only if it was less than $25. Also, the kit is too large. Half the size would be more than sufficient to hold all the pieces."
4,Great for imaginative play,"Not sure if it's because my daughter has repeatedly watched the Mr. Rogers episode where he visits the pediatrician, but she absolutely loves this kit. Hasn't tired of it yet. I think the multiple pieces are a plus with this toy (vs. overkill) in that it gives her lots of options and she makes up uses for each of them. The cell phone didn't work, but I was happy about that. Wish I could figure out how to disable the pager, but otherwise, this is a classic, low-tech toy. Great for kids entering role-playing stages of play."
2,Cheap toy,"From the packaging, this toy looks pretty good, but once you get it open you can see that it is cheap and poorly put together. The case did not fit around the edges when closed, and the clasps were difficult to use and popped open on their own. I would not recommend this if you like quality toys!"
4,Fun for kids but not great quality,"It was a hit with teh kids, I think some kids like playing pretend play more than any other games. The case is not so durable, and already broke when opening the packaging, I didnt want to return and get a new one as kids were already excited with teh contents inside the case and were playing with it instantly. For now when it needs to be carried, they hold it flat, instead of the handle, sucks for hte price we paid, but I guess its functional and being used quite often for now."
2,Not worth the purchase,"I do not recommend this product for several reasons. First, the plastic itself is cheap, particularly the very thin plastic that keeps the items in place. Secondly, the cell phone, stethoscope, and pager are very unreliable (they often do not make the sounds). Overall, it was not worth the money."
1,Cheap and poor,"Not good product, cheap and it doesn't worth for the price. I can find better products at lower price in Walmart..."
3,Not very durable,"The first time my soon to be 4 year old played with the blood pressure cuff, the seam cracked on the bulb and her finger got pinched inside of the hole. She also pinched her finger with the glasses. It is impossible for her to open the clips by herself for some reason. The rest of it has held up and kept her attention. I must say, that I am a little tired of getting check ups! :P She is terrified of the doctors office, and is now a little more comfortable with the idea now that she knows what everything is used for. I would probably buy a different kit if I ever needed to buy one again."
2,Cheapy plastic toy that doesn't last very long,"I was hoping to find a durable doctor set for my daughter and sadly to report back, this wasn't it.The stethoscope ripped as I was taking it out of the box. The blood pressure pump was on the firm side so it's hard for the little ones to pump. She does like the bandages that came in the box.Would not recommend the toy. Certainly would not pay $20+ for this if I had seen it at the box stores."
3,Too many extras,"Though we like this doctor set it has too many extraneous parts like ill fitting glasses and a cell phone. I would have liked to have a more compact and playful ""doctor"" bag instead of the too large plastic box. Additionally the blood pressure cuff is a little cheap and too small for my daughter to use on almost anybody or any of her toys."
4,Impressed,"I was very impressed with the number and variety of doctor ""tools"". My granddaughter was thrilled with it. It was much more complete than her brother's set. It's a very nice case. I'd recommend it."
5,Grandaughter loves it,My granddaughter (2 years old) loves to play with this set. Well made and a reasonable price. I think this product will last awhile.
5,My little doctor loves it !,We bought it for our 2 yr old. she loves to pretend to be a doctor and plays with it daily for the past 2 months.
3,Thought it would be better,"The stethoscope, you can't hear anything out of and it's just a fake heart beat. The blod pressure band is super fake. Wish kit was more real like."
1,Junk,"Don't waste your money on this doctor kit. I bought this for my grandchild. It is nothing like the ones we had for our children when they were young. Nothing works at all, just lumps of plastic. I'm looking for another one."
3,Too expensive for something so cheaply made,"My 2.5 year old son has lots of fun with this. But the first set we got had a cell phone that didn't work and a stethoscope that worked intermittently and a blood pressure gauge that didn't work and one other thing wrong with it I think. So we had to return it. The second set we got worked better, thankfully.You get a lot of pieces, but they are all *very* cheaply made. I think it would be an okay purchase if it was about half the price. Way too expensive for the quality (or lack thereof)."
4,Grandson has been playing doctor off and on for 4 months,"Hey, this keeps a 4 year old busy, interested and learning about, (whispers) going to the doctor's office! Each piece has a place it fits into for the carrier, which makes the pieces hard to keep up with, other than that, band-aids ahoy!"
5,Learning Resources Pretend & Play Doctor Set,This is one of the larger kits I've run across. It's pretty awesome. We do have fun with it. Another thing you can do is tie a long kite string to a blown up ziplock bag and tape the string to the hand like an IV. Good times....
3,It could be better,"I bought this with the intention of purchasing another case, as I am getting it for my niece and wanted to ""girlify"" it a little. I am glad that was my original plan because immediately when I opened the case, one of the clasps fell off. What a piece of crap! The items inside are fine, she will love it, I am sure. That is what is most important. The plastic band-aids are hilarious... and ridiculous all at the same time. I bought a new case (pink caboodle), adding my own real band-aids, and I think it will be a hit."
4,My 4 y/o neice loved the docotr set.,"My 4y/o niece loved the doctor set. She is very rambunctious and tough on her toys, but the doctor kit held up well and kept her entertained for hours."
4,Making Dr visit easier.,"My daughter loves this. If she's not feeling good, or has a ""boo boo"" we get this out and play Dr and she feels all better!"
4,Fun for children,"Fun toy, its amazing how a 3 year old will know how to use each of the tools in the kit. Children are incredibily perceptive and silently observe all that occurs in the doctors office. With this set they can recreate the visit in a constructive playful atmosphere and diminsh or eliminate any fears of going to the doctor's office. My daughters favorite piece is the 'syringe', don't worry, it is quite harmless. She loves giving mommy and daddy shots.Two of the toys come with a batteries already inside (the beeper and stethascope), interestingly the cell phone does not include a battery.The case is handy as it holds all the pieces, although I find I'm the one putting all the instruments back and not my daughter...hmmmmm.Only four stars as the plastic seems rather cheap and I would expect to pay between $10-20 instead of the somewhat expensive $26.00. Still it makes a great gift for any child who has visited the doctor."
5,GREAT,great item! the toy is for my child for christmas. My child loves to play make believe. this will be a great present for christmas.
3,not for that price,"I would not buy it again. reasons: blood preasure does not fit a real person even a little kid and it is impossible for a kid to make it work is so hard. stethoscope does not have realistic sound as stated. hard to fit in my four year old. I have not figured it out a way to use the plastic band-aids. glasses do not fit my son. Overall, it requires a lot of pretend...because the items that should work are not suitable for small kids."
5,One of the best,Great Dr. kit......so much to play with. The pager and phone really ring and make noise. They feel just like a real Dr. The stethoscope makes the heartbeat noise. My daughter loved it.
1,Disappointed,For the amount of money I expected more. I would not buy this product again. I will buy the basic less expensive one next time. The first thing I noticed was that the case is very difficult to close. The plastic clasps do not work properly and hardly ever snap back into place. The second thing was that the stethoscope did not work. I removed the plastic tab on the battery and then nothing. I will try replacing the battery but for $25 I expect to get a product with good working batteries. I also would have preferred a stethoscope that let's you hear your heartbeat not an electronic sound.**Update** I changed the rating from a 2 to a 1 because the batteries were leaking.
3,So-So,"Lots of Dr. tools are included with this kit, just a bit disappointed with the quality of the tools. I was looking for something a little bit nicer, thought going with Learning Resources I would get that ... still a great toy"
4,Good enough,"What i wanted from this toy was the ability to role play and just have fun, and it does both quite well. Ok, maybe the quality might be better, as a matter of fact the cellphone didn't work, but somehow we got over this fact and my son just loves it. That's all i care about. He uses his pager as a cellphone, so problem fixed!!! Now i have to be sick 50 times a day in order for him to ""fix"" me."
1,"Horrible, Please Don't waste your money!","I actually purchased this play set in 2010 as a Christmas gift, but set it aside and forgot about it. Fast forward to 2012 where it is rediscovered in all of it's plastic wrapped new glory and presented to my daughter who is playing doctor with her doll. She excitedly ripped off that sealed plastic covering, opened the box and started exploring the contents of the box. As she removed the stethoscope from the plastic holder it came apart in her hands with the plastic ear tubing coming apart from the heart beat section the screw hole that was holding them together completely ripped through. The glasses weren't even together in the box, one arm just laying there in the plastic holder as the other part came out. After trying several sets of new AA batteries in the ""cell"" phone it still never made a peep. I am so disappointed in this product. Please save yourself some money and frustration and skip this set!"
2,disappointing,"The blood pressure cuff snapped the first time my son played with it, it's made of cheap plastic. The stethoscope doesn't even really work, it's just a cheap noise maker that makes unrealistic fake heartbeat noises. There are no compartments for the toys, they all just get thrown into this plastic container when the child is done playing with it.For the price, the quality of this product is very poor. It's all cheap plastic and breaks easily."
5,A real kid pleaser!,"I bought this for my granddaughter's 4th birthday. She loves it! The beeper sound is realistic, as is the sound of the phone ring.She loves the stethoscope for it's heart sound and coughing sound. I had to give her a little instruction on opening and closing the case which accommodates all of the instruments plus a few things she has added to it. But she grasped the instruction well and slams it closed in a hurry to race to her next emergency! We have wasted so many bandaids until now. The ones included in the kit are quite ingenious and reusable. I was thrilled over the quality of it and the way it spikes her imaginary play. So worth the cost."
5,Thanks,"My son was begging for a doctor kit for Christmas, he was so excited that Santa brought him one. He loves to fix daddy and mommy up and make us all better"
4,Very nice comprehensive doctor kit,This kit has everything and anything a little one would need to play doctor. The one thing missing is scrubs or a lab coat. I really wish it included one. That's why I gave it 4 stars overall. The glasses are my favorite part. Hilarious!
2,"Cheap, falling apart after only a few uses","This is definitely not worth the money. My son received this for his 3rd birthday and it started falling apart within 2 weeks. The case is impossible for him to open, the plastic that holds the pieces in place is a disposable type of plastic and tore the first day, there are not slots for each item, the blood pressure cuff barely fits around a wrist and broke after 2 weeks. Just not worth it."
1,This needs to be recalled,"This toy has been great for my daughter to play with but a word of WARNING! The tongue depresser (I guess that's what you call it) has a mirrored disc glued on. IT COMES OFF! My daughter, while playing with it, accidentally swallowed it and started choking. Thankfully she was able to throw it up but it scraped her throat or esophagus because she threw it up with blood. This is extremely alarming! DON'T BUY...IT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED!"
3,"Fun toys, but made of cheap plastic","My 2 1/2 yo son loves this set and enjoys playing with many of the items. The electronic pager and phone add to the excitement of pretend 'emergencies'. The working designs are cool, but the set could've done without the scalpel, glasses, scissors, small tray and tweezers.My main problem is w/ the cheap plastic used & rough edges. Oddly, many of the items have screws for better durability. Seems they would've done better saving on costs with fewer items & better finishing.I'd recommend buying a smaller set for less, or going with a brand you can trust for quality."
2,Breaks and are not worth the money,This product is not worth the money. I read all the reviews and thought it'd be a good buy. Sure it comes in a nice box but it's huge compared to how much space the tools take up. The blood presure thingy is broken after one day of 5 min. of play.I would not recommend the set. Go with something like Iplay's stuff. They always make some durable toys- not like this.I also purchased the Learnings tools. The tool belt stains everything it comes near and the tools breaks easily. Don't buy it. It's broken already.
2,sub-par quality toy,THis set has everything you could think of a child would need to play doctor/hospital/nurse/etc. But the quality and make is mediocre.
3,Doctor Kit,I got the doctor kit for my granddaughter who lives with me she is three. She was very upset when we had to take her to the doctor so I thought her playing with the doctor kit would make the next event to the doctor not so scary. That really did help. My son had a fisher price doctor kit 25 years ago which I liked a lot better than this one. The kits liner for the tools is not sturdy enough put the tools back in and close the lid. So everything is loose in the kit and there is no way to organize it. Other than that it seems pretty sturdy. She loves playing with it.
1,Phone broken,Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter and the cell phone is broken. Got it out to put batteries in it before xmas morning and it doesn't light up or make a sound. Really this was the most important part of the entire kit and it doesn't even work. Amazon asks you to ship it back before they send you a new one. Well thats just great since Xmas is a week away. Guess we are stuck with it. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!
5,"Emergency, Mommy! Emergency!","That's what my 3-year-old granddaughter loves to shout as she plays with the Pretend and Play Doctor Set. I was truly amazed at how much she loves it. Not only does she love to play with it, she has learned about blood pressure, pagers, listening to a cough and heartbeat through a stethoscope, and how to use a mouth mirror to examine someone's teeth. I highly recommend this toy to anyone whose child has shown an interest in ""playing doctor."""
3,nice set,Thought the set was nice but a little cheaply made wish they made it better then expected. I would not order again though
5,LOVE IT,My three year old and 1 1/2 year old love this toy!! Every morning they wake up and play with it.
5,LOVE IT!,"I was searching for a doctor kit that had a case and this one is nice and fits all the items in it and is big enough to carry all his extra doctor item.... He loves it! Thank you,"
3,Lots of items but some of them are not durable,"My daughter received this for Christmas. The set is great with lots of different items. The hard plastic case is not durable and actually came broken. We ended up using the soft bag that came with our old Fisher Price Doctor set. Works perfectly plus it's much easier for little hands to carry around and can take a beating. The ear piece on the stethoscope broke after only a couple of months. I've been able to patch it back together with tape and hot glue, not too happy about that. The blood pressure pump has split at the seam, which means the arrow doesn't move since there is no longer any air pressure. Very disappointed with the durability of this item. For the price ALL of the pieces really should last more than 4-5 months."
5,gift for nephew,"I bought this set as a gift for my nephew's 4th birthday. He and the other children there absolutely loved it. I don't know any specifics about quality, durability, etc because I only gave it to him the other day, but for entertainment value he thought it was a blast!"
3,"Great doctor supplies, case TOO huge though","The supplies/tools that come in the kit are very lifelike and fun. My son has had hours of fun with it. The case it comes in, however, is very big and chunky. The white plastic inserts (where the tools are supposed to fit in to keep in place) are very flimsy and I don't think they were meant to stay in the kit- just there for display before purchasing. Once the plastic inserts are taken out, all the tools just fall to the bottom, leaving 3/4ths of the case empty. Just seems like a huge waste of a bag because it's so huge. Overall though, good stuff!"
4,Nice toy,Looked all over for a doctor kit for my nephew. This one seems to have all of the bells & whistles and is pretty durable. The carrying case is an added bonus.
3,Doctor Can Disturb Young Kids,"Some children who play ""doctor"" do not understand the psychological effects of doing so, with toys like this, there MUST be parent supervision or they may get out of hand or form type one dementia (nausea, sleepiness, yawning). The child must realize that being a doctor is a very difficult position and they must also learn about death. This toy is educational because it does have a booklet describing simple diseases and even talks about death of an old person. Be sure that your children have been brought up properly before using this because there is a plastic scalpel which they can use as a fake weapon against other children."
4,They Work,"When testing these for the first time, I actually ended up using them. I cornered too hard and ended up dropping the bike, but thanks to the handguard, the brake lever and etc. on the side it fell on were fine.One complaint; the instructions are pretty non-existent. Has some diagrams, and that's it."
3,Great Concept but Too Heavy and Difficult to attach,"I love the concept of teaching colors and just the general play with the ice cream cones - but I was extremely surprised by how heavy each ice cream scoop was ... which makes it difficult to easily double scoop, etc. It's also very difficult for my children to attach themselves. Not a big hit for my children ... just ok."
3,Fun but hard to attach,"My 2 year old loves this toy. The only downside is the icecream is a little hard to attach to the cone. Nonetheless, she loves to stack the ice cream up and plays with it every day."
5,Toddlers love this!,"My husband and I bought this for our niece and nephew who are age 2 yrs 8 months and 1 year four months. They love to play with this together. The older one will place the ice cream caps in a row for the younger one to stack. Then he claps his hands and says, ""Again!"" She un-stacks them and puts them in a row. They played this over and over together. My sister (their mother) tells me it is a great toy."
4,Tricky to put on the cone,My 4 yr old likes them but she has difficulty placing the first scoop on the cone. These are durable and well made and so far she loves them. I tell her a list of ice cream flavors I want then she trys to remember the list and make the cone for me. It increases her memory and attention to detail.
2,Poor sound quality.,"I have always loved Jerry Lee and particuraly love the movie. So I decided to buy the soundtrack. Boy, was I dissapointed. The sound quality is like listening to the songs on an AM radio in a very old car. I quess we are just spoiled to the new 5.1 digital surround sound of today."
5,A Great Overview of Jerry Lee's Music,"When I first saw the movie, I knew immediately that I had to get the soundtrack. I wasn't disappointed in the least. While Lewis doesn't sound in his twenties anymore, he still sounds good. I also enjoyed the R&B songs that influenced Lewis's style of rock and roll. It is easy to forget how dirty some of those songs actually were. The duet between Lewis and Quaid I enjoyed as well, though it is not the strongest song on the CD, it is simply fun. All in all, a must-have for any Jerry Lee fan and great CD for any music lover"
2,They only last about a year,"Of the three drills I've owned, these batteries are the worst batteries in terms of product life.They lasted about a year. I stored them in a cool dry place, didn't use them much, but after one year they are dead and it's almost as cheap to buy a new drill as it is to replace both batteries.Why buy a portable drill for upwards of $150 or $200 if it's only going to last one year and then you have to spend $150 to replace the batteries?"
5,A Classic that should be republished!,"I loved this book when I was a little girl and have searched for a copy for my children! It is a wonderful tale of a local boy that has his mind set against ""summerfolk"". In his mind, they are ""thick as sand fleas and twice as pesky"", but one day he meets a unique group of children who are summerfolk and his mind is changed. It is sweet and whimsical and the illustrations wonderful!"
2,Not what I expected,A home movie record of a few forms presented at a gathering of tai chi teachers and students. No real explanations or narration. A visual record of to remember Master Jou.
4,Much better than I remembered it being the first time I watched it.,"Yes, I saw this at the theater years ago. I loved the movies and had high hopes for this one. At the time, I was disappointed. I felt it was a real departure from the originals. However, the Blade movies went on sale here on Amazon a little while back, so i though, ""Why not?"" I guess my tastes have changed over the years because I really enjoyed it this time around. I still didnt really like the vampires, outside of the main vamp, but I think where my tastes changed was in appreciation of the humor in the movie. I thought Ryan Reynolds comebacks in particular were pretty awesome. Jennifer Beals...well, I can watch her anytime, and of course Blade was Blade, although maybe not quite so serious as in previous movies. All in all, and with new consideration, I think this movie was really good. Maybe not quite as good as the first two, but good nonetheless, and quite enjoyable. I'll probably watch it again sometime.Enjoy!"
5,Great!,"Brand new, wrapped, and arrived quickly. We had this movie on DVD but wanted the improved quality of blu-ray. This video isn't available in the States for some reason but we received the movies(we bought all three) really fast."
3,Gr8 finale to the Blade Trilogy,"I needed to add this movie to our collection to complete the series. I've always been a vampire fan and Wesley Snipes has truly done a phenomenal job with his role as the ""Daywalker."" Even though this movie isn't as good as the first, its still a good action flick."
5,Blade: Trinity,"Blade Trinity is a wonderful movie but takes a different path then the first two. If you are looking for a good action flick with humor thrown in, Blade Trinity is definitly for you."
2,NOT THE BEST BLADE MOVIE!,"PROS.JUST SEEING BLADE KILLING SOME VAMPIRES IS ALLWAYS WORTH WATCHING!CONS. JOKE TELLING SIDE KICKS FOR A HORROR ACTION MOVIE STINKS! IT KIND OF MAKES YOU BELIEVE THE RUMORS ABOUT BLADE BEING REPLACED BY HANNIBAL KING AND THE NIGHTSTALKERS! I WOULD PREFER TO CONTINUE TO SEE BLADE DO THAT JOB INSTEAD OF THEM ANY DAY!IN ALL.IF YOUR A FAN OF THE BLADE MOVIES, YOU SHOULD STILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE!"
2,Poor addition to the Blade series,"The first blade was amazing. Great story, insane action, good score to tag along. The second was nice as well. But this movie was almost like a made for tv movie spinoff about a joke bunch of missfits guest staring blade. Not to mention its a big commerical. Spend your money on something more deserving"
3,"Ok, but not great","This installment was not the greatest one of the three, but with the help of Jessica Beil it managed to perform somewhat. It is not bad, but needed more action. Also despite what others say Parker Posey was a terrible choice for the lead vampire villian. Her acting is subpar at best. In almost any scene her presence served only to drag things down. This is supposed to be the last one, but as usual the ending says otherwise. Although considering all vampires die in this one except Blade I wonder who they are going to hunt."
4,Good entertainment!,"What else can you expect from this kind of movie - it's very light, entertaining, funny, action packed, has good acting. Enjoyable to watch. As good as previous movies of this series. It seems that it will be the final one - there shouldn't be any vampires left. Still, Wesley Snipes looks like still fighting somebody (as indicated in the end of the movie). Foot in the door? - we will see."
3,"almost great, but a finale as ""epic"" as an undercard fight","On paper, Blade Trinity had the potential of being the best and baddest of the trilogy. Early on in the film, it appeared that those expectations would be easily met...and with a showdown against Dracula still on the horizon, Trinity was headed toward ""epic"" status. However, at some point the movie begins to lose focus, and at times you might wonder whether you're watching a Blade or a Nightstalkers (a new sidekick duo of Blade's) flick. The eventual battle with Dracula didn't measure up to the finale of either Blade or Blade 2, and deserved much, much more...I mean, if I didn't know better, I'd thought 'ol Drac took an early dive in that fight. Blade Trinity is the weakest of the franchise, but then again the first two ARE pretty hard to top...in spite of its flaws 'tho, Trinity still manages to entertain."
2,The best thing about the movie is the music,The best thing about the movie is the music and that's the only good thing. I yawned thru this movie so many times I lost count. So my friend and I grooved to the music to keep ourselves awake!
1,Moved about as fast as Whistler's Mother!,"In one word: Awful! All talk and barely any action. The Blade character is nothing more than a bit part in the midst of a bad one-liner comedy.If you must see it, then rent it first."
1,Should have stopped at Blade 2,"I found myself yawning through most of this movie. There was little to arouse my interest, except for a couple of brilliant insults uttered by the 'comic relief' character who was one of Blade's sidekicks and I cannot remember his name. However, not even Jessica Biel could save this mindless trash. Whistler dies ... again (but we all know that there is nothing that can keep that man down). Despite the fact that every law enforcement group in the world was after Blade, I felt strangely unconcerned. He's already gone up against a god, and those freaks in the second one. A bunch of cops aren't going to cut it.It was certainly the most unconvincing version of Dracula I have ever seen - as well as the weirdest looking looking female vampire villain, who was more amusing than scary."
1,"First 2 were good, this one is atrocious.","The first 2 films were very good. The only thing I didn't like was the fake CG effects in Blade 2. But this one is just terrible. I mean c'mon, how can regular humans fight vampires in hand-to-hand combat and kill them? Now I'm no expert on vampires... But aren't they supposed to be immortal and have super-human abilites? The story-line is weakening, so they have to bring in 2 new main-characters. The script also has much to be desired. So, Wow, talk about annoying, this movie is almost as bad as Resident Evil 2.I'd rent it before buying it."
4,Better than the other two,"outstanding! More sarcasm, more action, more twists. Just all in all better than the other two."
1,Don't believe the positive reviews,"Sequels are usually a bit of a letdown. Thanks to prozac I've learned to deal with that, but Blade Trinity is a mess all onto itself. What could have been interesting got completly fumbled in the execution. Starting with the whole Dracula plot and the addition of Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds and the horribly miscast Natassa Lyonne who seems like she's in another movie altogether. The only thing saving this creepshow is some well choreographed fight scenes and Parker Posey camping it up as Danika. Strained on what the hell to do with the story, the everything but kitchen sink plot includes vampire dogs. That's right folks, vampire dogs. Avoid at all costs."
3,Predictable,"Rent it - don't buy it. Formulaic and predictable - great actionscenes, good F/X - light on plot. The action, like the chicks arehot, but the film is only lukewarm. I really enjoyed I & II butthis one was a disappointment."
2,THIS BLADE --HAS NO EDGE,"this movie is not the one I thought they would have made. this movie has intended modern day humor--but, its all humorless---not funny at all. BLADE 1+2 had some edge to it and took the movie reasonably serious, but this is just doppy. cool special effects, nice attractable young cast(does their best-but fails) seems allbeit just wasted. the movie could have been the grande finale in the series but with its unever tone and content--it just sinks. wesley is always great and stunts are cool, but if you do not have writing, decent plot, or people you care about -its just pointless. I could not wait for some if not all of them die--here is for hope!---wesley has a right to be pissed off. the company ruined the picture. if there is a BLADE 4 lets hope its stays to the first two movies tone. sorry, no sale"
4,pretty good,blade trinity was a pretty fun movie too watch. which is as good as the other two blade movies.
2,Why?...,"This movie is a posterchild for not letting B-List actors have a say in what happens in the movie. Wesley Snipes is a great action star.... That's it!! He doesn't direct, he doesn't produce, and I think that the most actual acting he's done in a movie was ""Wildcats"" with Goldie. The movie stank, the actors stank King stole the show and saved the Seventh Heaven reject and the action superstar. Maybe they should do a movie on him. Until Wesley stops directing, make mine Spidey!!!!!!"
1,Absolutely awful.....,"I didn't like the first two Blades, but I appreciated them. But this one, it was with out question the worst movie I have ever seen. Why movies nowadays portray Dracula as a nothing I have no clue. Dracula is the supreme villain, having walked the earth for thousands of years. A master of disguise, a murderer, and the untouchable. This movie also makes him look weak. Blade is a mortal, Dracula is not. If you read history, you can not kill Dracula the way he is killed in movies. Save your 7 dollars and go see Waterworld. You'll get more excitement out of that. I gave it one star because it won't let me go ten stars in the negative."
2,For those really in the know,"David Goyer proves he is a writer and NOT a director for this series final. Product placement is shamefully abused. The Blade character is simply in this movie to set up the next series about the Nightstalkers. Read the other reviews and you can tell, who is writing for simplicity and who is really reviewing this based on the previous films and expectations of the series."
2,So-So Movie,"I'm not a huge fan of the Blade trilogy to be honest. I mean really, how many martial art vampires are there? I realize it's a fantasy film of course but the fighting was too unnatural, not organic enough. Also having Dracula be from the middle east instead of Transylvania was also rather weird."
5,"Definitely lives up to its hype, go see it now.","I was very satisfied with Blade Trinity, it had all action,suspsense and new characters like Abigail Whister, playedone of the most beautiful actresses around Jessica Biel.Even pro wrestler HHH has a brief role as one tough assvampire.There were some criticisms of the film, but I cant reallysee any faults in it. I enjoyed the Blade series as a wholeand even brushed on watching Blade II before seeing thisone.The movie combines all the elements that made the trilogymemorable and this is just as good.If rhis is the end of the series, it certainly goes as it shouldwith a loud bang!!!"
2,Has it's strengths but...,"My major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires. These extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u-v lamp, vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin, and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun. Vampires are supposed to be scary, but how frightened of them should I be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him. Writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable. The first Underworld movie would be a good model."
4,Enjoyable,Blade:Trinity is an enjoyable actiona packed movie. It's just full adreneline fun with hardly any seriousness. Once major flaw is the casting of Parker Posey who is way too off to play a vampire. I think Fairuza Balk would've been better.
4,Pretty damn cool.,"I'll start with the drawbacks. The head vampire girl (Parker Posey, is it? What a pretentious-sounding name) was absolutely terrible. She was horrid. It was some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Ever.Wesley was Wesley. He was cool.Drake was a bit lame. Just a bit. He was almost caricatured.Jessical Biel was decent in her role. Can't really say more for her than that. She's good eye candy and she filled the role, but she didn't excel in it.Ryan Reynolds stole this show. He was classic. I guess some people were annoyed by him, but he was absolutely hilarious and definitely, in my mind, made Blade: Trinity worth owning."
1,The Worst in the series.,"I agree with tha inspecta. This movie was very low brow. All the heart got ripped away in David S. Goyer's director debut. They should have gotten the director of the original blade. Maybe then there would be more room for creative changes since all characters were either two-dimensional, lacked in mental abilities, are easily snuck up on when they should be couragous military type professionals, and have no depth, rhyme, reason, or sense. It's a total let down. There were some talk and rumors of there being a fourth blade or a night hunters spin off or some nonsense like that. The best advice I can give is this: let sleeping dogs lie."
4,"Good action movie, especially if you have a 6.1 channel H.T.","This is a "" good "" movie, a lot of action, maybe the best of the Blade trilogy, like most of the action movies is predictable, and to compensate it the story gives Blade some help from people we never knew they exist, but it's only an action movie, I can't judge it too hard.What I really like is the DTS ES, is amazing, the additional surround channel really makes a diference, if you have a H. T. with 6.1 channels, get this movie, it's worth it."
1,Uninspired,"The battles are so one-sided, you start rooting for the vampires. I mean, one touch of Blade's silver weapons and they're dead. Wow, really exciting, huh.And their casting of Dracula was completely wrong. I mean terribly wrong.Also, Blade and Whistler seem to be killing or severely injuring humans in this movie - blasting them with shotguns, blowing them up, etc. I found that reprehensible. What's the point of vampire hunting if not to protect humans?"
2,to the point,"The action wasn't on par with the Blade series at all, the plot was absurd, and Ryan Reynolds, who I'm usually alright with, was just annoying and simply does not fit into the Blade series. Like this movie as a whole.The opening sequence was alright, but from there it just went downhill. About the only good parts of this movie are the fact that Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson are both in it again.So, it comes down to a lot of trilogies--the first two are great, but the third you should only buy if you absolutely LOVE the character, regardless of how bad the movie they put him/her into is. I just picked this one up because it was dirt cheap and I hadn't seen it."
3,Blade,"This item was not rated when I purchased it. It is not for children. The language is not for children. I have a way to program some of the language out with my dvd player, but then I would get whole scenes with not dialogue at all. But for the adult audience, I think it is an interesting addition to Blades story plot. I just hate the language. Some of the conversations could have been left out of the movie and the signs with the bad language.The language sort of ruined the movie for me."
1,He should have stayed in bed!,"Snipes basically just didn't look like he wanted to do this movie. He walked through the whole movie... or was sleep walking. The two partners with no super strength or speed were beating vampires as easily as Blade. The major let down was when Blade and Dracula had their final battle. There was not much of a fight considering Dracula should have given him more of a fight than the previous villians. Overall, he should have stayed in bed and let someone else take the movie seriously. Oh, the constant jokes by the co-star got WAY OUT OF HAND!"
1,Dull Blade,"Don't wast your money, ESEPCAILLY if you are a Blade fan. The story line was so-so the ""co-stars' bought NOTHING to the movie. There acting and fight scenes were teh worst, thusly they cut down on Snipes contribution. The DVD is best used as a coaster to hold your drink while watching another movie"
2,Dracula ruined It,"Trust me, the actor playing him wasn't bad but they totally f-ed up the story and myths of dracula. I even wanted a demon looking monster but what i got was crap. I liked Van Helsings design better accually. At least he could fly. And Dracula did not look perfect considering he is supposed to be a vampiric god! And since when is Blade a more perfect vampire then Dracula as stated in the finale of the film. Forget that! Want a vampire movie? ""Queen of the Damned"", or even the anime classic ""Vampire Hunter D"". Much better and both movies have more kick a** hunters in them. D is the son of Dracula and Lestat f-ed a goddess! This movie sucks!"
4,"Simply Fantastic, But Not Perfect.","To start I'd have to say, I could not wait to see this movie, after only hearing the soundtrack before the movie was released. It just really got me pumped to see it.Given it had a cheesey moment here and there, and the ending was a bit confusing for me would justify a 4 star rating. But, I still absolutely enjoyed it. The action was precise, loud, and in your face. Just the way it should be.Now after reading all the reviews of you people totally picking this movie apart. Don't you have anything better to do? You just got to sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie for what it is. Because no matter how much you complain, you cannot change it.So don't pay attention to their reviews, see it, and form your own. Blade Trinity is far from disappointing."
2,The weakest of the bunch!!,"This was a painfull movie to watch! The Blade franchise runs its course with this thrid release and shows its a total mess. Wesley Snipes looks like he just wants this film to end with his performance. He seems almost boored! The storyline is weak and the dialogue is ugly to listen. The choreographed action scenes are fair. The biggest mistake was killing off the character played by Kris Kristofferson in order to bring in a younger audience. In the last 2 movies, he gave the movie class. The producers should have known that if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
3,THIS BLADE SUCKED BIG TIME!!!!!,"Blade - Trinity,Hope this is the last part of this series, because really sucked!!. For just audio sound I gives 3 starts, ""NOT the movie""...the blade 3, was the worst of all the series, silly, lame scrip & lame jokes and bad acting in both female and men's.. The regional blade was the best in the series skip the rest. After first got worst and 3erd one real stinks & lame!! C"
1,Oooohh... Blade!,"After those words were uttered... I knew. I knew like you know a good melon when you hold it in your hands. Albeit this was a bad melon. That's right. This movie was bad. How bad? So bad, I'll never go to another night showing of a movie for quite sometime... call me the matinee man. Actually no, the moment the vampire gives the sun the proverbial ""bird"", I knew then and there that Blade had become a joke. The only upside to this movie, if there was one, was Ryan Renolds. His presence alone allowed me to sit and stay the length on this movie. It seemed the director tried too hard. Every scene with the bad guys had them entering in slow-motion with quasi-cool music with bass lines. How cool can it be if the main bad guy is Dracula? Dracula?! Ugh... So to reiterate and to sum up... How bad was Blade Trinity? So bad I think it gave me cancer."
2,Not what I remembered,"I loved this movie when it came out. About 3 months ago I ordered the whole trilogy on Blu-ray and the third one really doesn't hold up next to the other two. I see now why this movie was panned by critics upon release. It's just okay for me, especially next to the other two."
2,Blade 2 should have been the final chapter,"Parts one and two were funny movies, but Trinity just went over a certain fantasy limit. I mean the story itself is not so important of course as the Blade plot simply remains the same: vampire slaying throughout the whole movie.This time however two news dimensions are added: the ancient Dracula story is comingled with Blade and Blade joins forces with the Nighthunters or whatever they are called. Both ideas do not make the movie more interesting. In fact Dracula should not be in this type of movie and the Vampire Hunters cannot be taken seriously, as one of them never stops making jokes. The stupidest scene however is beautiful skinny Jessica Biel (1.60 m) beating up 15 adult vampires all by herself!Let's close the Blade story! (SARR)"
3,(BLADE 3) A BIT DULL,"I watched Blade 3 tonight. It started off great, but after thefirst hour, it started getting boring. I enjoyed it though. Thedisc has great sound quality! It's worth a rent."
4,Enough B-Grade Laughs For All Suckers!,"Director David S. Goyer continues his vampire vanity story here and it still pulls out some surprises. Besides their usual dark comedy and slick special effects, he adds some new chemistry. There is a new team to replace Kristofferson and they are all delightfully ex-vampires. The big surprise is that the endangered species of vampires are recreating themselves in BIG vampire factories. The biggest kick of all is that the original Vampire himself, who has been self-exiled for decades due to his disgust in human nature, finally awakens. He does this in modern day Iraq. Now if that doesn't make you laugh you have no time for this film. Lots of excitement and comic book action here. Don't miss it."
3,feeding our guilty pleasures,"I purchased this DVD well aware of what I was buying. It is by no means a cinematic marvel or by any means a peak in the super hero genre, especially with the films being put out right now. (Avengers, The Dark Knight Trilogy....you know what movies i'm talking about here) That being said, I do enjoy this movie in a guilty pleasure sense. Sometimes you want just a dumb action movie. I have a feeling this series is eventually going to just be completely forgotten about, I was kind of surprised they even bothered with a blu-ray edition. The acting is what you'd expect from any wesley snipes movie even though it does have a few bigger names in it, before they got terribly known. Worth a watch but don't expect your friends to support you ha!"
2,BLAME CANADA AGAIN,"Once again the only pro of this bluray is it is the movie(which itself is worth about 2 stars), but once again it is the Canadian version which is worthless to me because the only reason I buy DVDs or Bluray is because of the Special features and Canadian Prints have NONE!! I dont know if this movie has been released in the U.S. on a bluray but WTF Amazon. Instead of just making sure the disc is in English let's put if it is the american version so i dont have to waste my time"
3,IT WAS OK,IT WAS JUST OK AND BUT IT WILL HAVE TO DO UNLESS I BUY IT FROM SOME OTHER PLACE I GIVE IT A D-
2,bad 2nd disk,It took 8 days to receive the first video. The second disk had a 1 inch groove that made it inoperable. Returned it and received replacement 6 days later.
2,It's a shame,"This is one of the worst endings to a trilogy that I've ever seen. Every bad thing you've heard about this dvd is true. Unfortunately, those of us who collect, and have bought the first two, will feel compelled to buy it anyway. My sympathies."
1,Blade has lost his role,Wow um theres alot of stuff in this movie that really doesnt have a plot.This movie wasnt as good as they say it was becuase one it SUCKED like **** another thing is it was dum as heck the OLD FART BAG IN BLADE ONE SHOT HIMSELF RIGHT THEN HOW THE HECK DID HE COME BACK TO LIFE!!!!WAS IT A GHOST OR SOME BULL CRAP BUYER BE****EN WARE THIS MOVIE IS A BUNCH OF CRAP IT WAS SHORT AS **** AND YOU WOULD HAVE A MORE ACTIONED PACKED MOVIE LOOKING AT TARZAN THE DISNEY VERSOIN!!!!!!
1,Horrible.,"Hands down, one of the worse sequels ever made. Not even in the same ball park as the first two films.Avoid."
1,"Loud music, no story","I wasn't going to go to this show to see very deep characters and story, but that was beneath anything I expected, and far worth than the previous movies.The music is hard rock played so insanely loudly that it takes away any little pleasure I could have gotten. I left the theater w/ a pounding headache."
2,"1 Star Above ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""",I don't want to ruin it for everyone but first a run down on what was good about this movie.1. Jessica Biel2. The Vampire PomperanianNow what was bad.I'm not really sure because I kept falling asleep.
2,The worst of the three,"This movie was ok. But there was a lot of crap in it. For startes I couldn't stand Ryan Reynolds and the fact that he was in a movie like this was just like a hemeroid to me...irritating and sometimes painful. Kris Kristoferson as usual is just great so... they kill him off right away. Jessica Biel was pretty bad though at least she gave you something to look at. But stuff int he story and the dialogue was just idiotic. ""My name is Hannibal King. And this little hellion, is Abigale."" I mean Jesus it was just like a comic book that some idiot wrote. WWE wrestler HHH was also, you guessed it, AWFUL!The best part of it besides Kris Kristoferson was Wesley Snipes. He actually salvaged something out of it cause he is just such a badass and cool in these movies. The guy that played Dracula who is in the TV show Prison Break looked imposing at first but then came off more like somebody from a bath house in San Francisco."
3,Blade Meets His Maker!,"3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodHere is where the ""Blade"" series hit a low, but then again, the first one was very good, though not great. It was not even in the same blood type as ""Blade II,"" which was just freaking awesome!The third film is worth the watch, I mean, any film with Blade meeting Dracula has to have some redeeming qualities, right?Bela Lugosi may be rolling over in his coffin, & Christopher Lee may take a hammer & stake to this film, but still,"" Blade: Trinity"" is very entertaining!"
3,Eh,"SO many sequels prove to disappoint, and this one is no exception. The first Blade movie was wonderful, the second one all right, but you can see that this movie was just a way to milk a popular franchise for money, and when this is the intent, the movie inevitably suffers. I would say only watch this if you are a die-hard fan and want to see what happens after the first two films."
5,Blade III,Vampire movies are hot these days and this is no exception. It even has pro-wrestling star Triple HHH as a bad guy on it. Martial arts meets Dracula in this final battle between Blade and vampires. Ryan Reynolds is funny as usual but is also buffed and tough in this movie. Jennifer Biel is hot and Karate crazy in this movie. The best of the Blade movie series. Highly recommended!
3,A bit below expectations,This review is regarding the movie itself and nothing more. I was disappointed that Snipes was not involved more the movie. The whole plot of the movie was okay...but not something to give a standing ovation. I think the two new vampire hunters pretty much made the movie. Their fighting was awesome. Dracula was also disappointing and the only power he really had was to walk in the daylight and change into human form. You would think Dracula the very first vampire of its kind would have a little bit more to offer us- he doesn't.The only other thing I liked in the movie was the vampire dog. I was cracking up...yes there is a lot of humor in the movie which is why I give it 3 stars.So to wrap up if you're looking for a few laughs and some action moves...go and see it. I would definitely wait until it comes out on DVD to rent it though...the expectation of this movie was NOT the greatest. But hey it's Blade.
1,This movie sucked and not in a good way,"I wasn't all that crazy about the first Blade movie. I really loved the second Blade movie, but this one was a complete joke! It became less about Blade and more about Whistler's ""sexy daughter"". But even, that wasn't the problem.The dialogue was terrible, the acting wasn't all that either. But even THAT wasn't the problem.The plot was atrocious. First off, aren't vampires supposed to get stronger the older they are? So why is the first vampire running from Blade? Why do they seem matched in power? Dracula should have wiped the floor with Blade.Also, in the beginning when Whistler's daughter was setting a trap for the vampires by using the fake baby. Shouldn't the vampires have been able to tell it was a fake baby?Basically a lot of lame scenarios to try to pull this movie off. So not good."
3,Capping off the Blade series,"I felt this was a good movie to end the blade series, although the ending from the extended version is quite confusing, and it does pay to watch the original ending. The special effects were great, with the additions of Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Beil help to give humanity back to Blade's character. If you like the rest of the Blade franchise pick this up but if you are looking to start watching blade start with the first in the series. Lots of action, more of the great one liners(especially from Ryan Reynolds), and more Blade being Blade. Make sure to watch the special features."
2,"Worst movie of the three, no doubt about that.","This is easily the weakest of the three Blade movies. Snipes's acting is totally robotic, plot is boring, jokes aren't funny. I managed to reach the end of the movie by sheer determination. Very, very boring action flick. I did not expect this sequence to be worst than the other two movies."
2,An okay comic movie,"Being a ""comic geek"" I considered this movie a must see. I enjoyed the 1st Blade movie and was hoping for the Blade story to be greatly expanded on in this triligy.This movie has added a lot of comic situations and one-liners to keep your interest as the basic fight scenes that you would expect in a ""vampire"" movie are not enough to make this a great movie, but the path has been set to let Blade go away and set the scene for more movies of this nature with ""Daywalkers"".All in all, an okay movie, but not one I would recommend to others looking for an action film."
2,Sit-throughable if you're action and/or vampire movie buff,The third venture into Marvel's Blade movie is something less than the first two offerings. As an action movie it stands fine on it's own. Fine meaning that if you like action movies you'll watch it until the end. If you consider that the characters are continuing to take more of a backseat to the action in each movie then you'll understand my disappointment here. Add a star if you're not concerned that the actors phoned in their performances and the main villain comes across as dull.
2,Total Disappointment,"I really enjoyed the original Blade movie. Blade 2 was okay. But Blade 3 was a total letdown. You can read all the other detailed reviews to see what the plot is all about. They tried to put some humor into this movie but I thought it was annoying. At one point, the original vampire (Dracula) dangles a baby over the edge of a building so that Blade won't attack/fight him. Don't forget, we are talking about the original all powerful original vampire and he's afraid to fight Blade? How lame can you get? (If you remember well, there was a similar situation in the first Blade movie where a girl was held hostage by one of the vampires. How original!) Only extreme Blade fans should buy this movie."
1,Absolutely awful,Where would I start. The plot was most likely written in a weekend. The acting is awful. The special effects marginal at best and very sparatic. Its incredibly boring and the introduction of several new characters completely ruined the pace of the flick. The 1st two Blades were excellent. I was incredibly disappointed in this disaster. The lame attempt at humor in this movie is laughable in itself. The jokes suck and the delivery is inappropriate. I couldn't wait for this mess to end. The directors and producers should be prosecuted for ruining a franchise that was built on two excellent prequels. This is by far one of the worst sequels I have ever seen. Some of these reviewers must be on the payroll of New Line Cinema or a family member of the director. Dont buy this junk. Rent it first and then thank me for not wasting your money.
1,Blade Trilogy Ending Deserves Better Than This !!,"This movie smacks of sub-par quality. Unlike its two predecessors which are far superior, Blade III is plagued with a poor script, an unqualified director (sorry, David Goyer is no director), and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best comicbook-to-film trilogies in the marketplace. Think Godfather III in the Godfather series and you'll know why to bypass this awful film. This movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the Blade character in the first two films. Without these attributes, the follow-on action and violence in the film (an artistic staple in the Blade franchise) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you'd expect. What you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters (including Snipes's Blade) who are all dressed up with no where to go. Rated or Unrated, avoid this DVD at all cost. It isn't worth the money or the effort."
1,The series that keeps on sucking,"Well, of course Dracula had to appear, and of course Whistler had a daughter, and of course another fiendish plot was hatched to deprive Blade of his day-walking blood . . . COULD THIS MOVIE HAVE BEEN ANY MORE PREDICTABLE! OR ANY LESS STUPID! No, I don't think so. Putrid, nonsensical trash. As if the movie's plot wasn't bad enough, they had to throw in Ryan Reynalds and his comic-relief idiocy. Its a vampire flick (albeit a terrible one) not a night at the improv. Although if it had been labeled as a comedy I might have enjoyed it more. (Not!) Thank God I only borrowed it. If I'd actually paid to see this garbage I'd have to give myself a transfusion."
