5,"Great Picture, Sound and Quality. Beats Samsung in EVERY way.","I had the Samsung 56""Samsung HL-S5686W which is a piece of garbage. When I moved it to plug in a dvd player the whole set woobled due to it's cheapness. Even the screen moved. BestBuy had me return it and try another Samsung(same model)as they thought the one I had was a lemon. That Samsung had the same noisy, pixely, smeared picture in SD, HD, and with DVD's. It was a mess.I then got this Toshiba and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! CLEAR picture, great sound, quality made set.Consumer reports rated this set as Excellent in BOTH SD and HD and I agree with them. DVD's with my Oppo DV-981HD DVD player look almost like HD DVD. I am that impressed. Get the Toshiba. Better Processors, Better Picture, Better made, BIGGER picture, Better set."
2,Not a 1080p TV,"After installing the TV and reading the manual, this TV does not accept 1080p signal. It says so in plain letter in the manual. I think Amazon needs to change the designation in the item title. The TV was returned to the seller."
3,Bought 3 Square feet - got 2,"Bought this to quick wash my dog with very short hair. It works great but the product description was very off size wise (hence the three stars). Otherwise, it's soft, absorbs water, and wipes her clean. It also doesn't seem to dry as hard as some other chamois."
4,I am only guessing....,"That this chamois is just fine. I got it for a gift to my dad, who loves these things, so all I can comment on, is when I got it in the mail, it looked and felt of great quality. And a much better price on Amazon, than in the stores."
4,Very Satisfied,"Shipped very quickly and are staying true to size and color after many washings. I am very pleased, and would definitely recommend this this product."
3,Ok but really a fuchsia color,"I bought this item in petal pink. They came in, and it's the darkest fuchsia you can imagine. These were just ordered to be extra pillow cases for when I have 7-8 people at the house so it doesn't matter, but if you're buying it to match something, it's a very dark pink.Softness is ok, nothing special."
2,disappointed in these sheets,"i am disappointed in the fabric these sheets are made from. even if I get them out of the dryer immediately, they are wrinkled. i guess i could iron them, but that probably wont happen. also I bought extra pillow cases because we have many pillows and not all of the pillowcases were the same color; some were lighter blue than the others."
2,Disappointed,I needed a fuchsia or hot pink pillowcase and this was the only one I could find. It's a bit rough to the touch even after washing with fabric softener.
5,"""Bronco"" Orange pillowcases","Even tho' they aren't a high thread count of bed linen, I found them very soft andcomfortable feeling. I did machine embroidery on the hems and the material didn'tshrink nor pucker around the design. Nice product!"
2,Disappointing . . . the lack of power issue is real,"I bought this product after reading many favorable reviews here. The hub port is sturdy and low-profile. However, and it's a big however, IT WON'T RECHARGE MY IPHONE! I, of course, plugged in the AC adapter thinking that it would solve the issue. Nada. This deficiency is utterly unacceptable.I'm returning this unit and looking for another one."
1,Junk,"Not worth the money. Same issues as my cheaper hub. I have seven items plugged in, and everytime I power up my IMAC, I have to plug and replug the hub power supply before my systen recognizes what's plugged in. I bought this thing to aleviate that problem in a cheaper hub I had. They claim this hub is not plagued by power requirements...evidently, not so."
1,not enough juice! could not even power keyboard on Mac Pro,"Have a MacPro 2009 model - when powered by AC adapter, still not enough juice to run even the apple keyboard - though my G5 tower did. Not as described - returning! - going to try Belkin. Using a Belkin - in an A-B comparison with this unit & a Belkin 4 port hub I have, I was able to power ALL the devices this hub could not - no problem."
3,Defective,"I've had this plugged into my computer for about two weeks. Today it decides that two of its ports won't work. Apparently no power is getting to them....the power lights aren't lit and when I tried devices in them, they didn't work. Haven't decided yet if it's worth the hassle of returning it....I probably won't need those two ports (but then what happens if more fail). I should have paid more attention to the other reviewer who said it failed as time went by."
2,TOTALLY INADEQUATE POWER!,"This hub might be ok if you're using flash drives, or other low power devices. But don't expect it to power external hard drives, or charge an iPhone/iPod. The included AC adapter is simply inadequate.Simply put, each port requires .5AThe included AC adapter is rated at 3AEven if the AC adapter is delivering the rated power (which it isn't), that would power only 6 of the 7 ports. Plugging in the 7th device simply flakes out the hub!Unfortunately, most hub manufacturers don't specify the power rating of the included AC adapter, so it's extremely difficult to know which hub to buy. The only hub I found that says it offers the full .5A per USB port isMacally TRIHUB4 Mini 4 Port USB 2.0 Hub with AC Adapter (Black)I shall keep searching!"
3,Worked ok for a while,"I've used this hub for just over a year. Only 5 of the 7 ports continue to function. Using a power adapter is a must for all 7 ports (or even 5 now).I've had better and worse. The hub definitely impacts performance. The design is only OK as well. With power and source on one side and the 7 devices on the other, it must be installed inline - meaning there will be cables in the way (for me anyway). I'd have preferred them all on one side, but I knew this going into the purchase. It turned out to be a bigger irritant than I expected."
4,Seven port hub,I'm having difficulties with inserting the USB of my Webcam into the Hub Port. I tried different ports with the same result ( no Picture). So I decided to use the one left available in my computer and it worked. Presently I'm utilizing four of the seven ports available in the Hub and have no complain.
1,Horrible! No power!,I bought this to power external hard drives since USB ports are all in use on my PC. I had this product for a long time. I thought maybe that this product was not supposed to host hard drives so I been using my 7 port hub to power my keyboard and mouse. Plenty of power right? wrong! my mouse from time to time powers off then powers back on. its annoying. I would not recommend this device for anyone. I will be trying a new one and seeing if it is any better power wise but this is a terrible purchase.
2,A disappointment,"Not the sellers fault.However,the very first port does not work.Got improper installment warnings on it upon hooking it up.will never buy another like it."
4,Excellent with one drawback,"Excellent, however I believe without being able to prove it, that it creates a strong magnetic field around it. My external speakers made a humm. eventually I used it with a different computer."
4,"Paper is good, book is a bit shoddy","The outside of this book wears out FAST, but the paper inside is great. The pages don't fall out unless you abuse the book, but the cover is pretty ""cheap"" overall. This is a great drawing pad for a child or hobby artist."
2,"Okay, but Not Very Useful","This book is alright, but not very useful. It's pretty much all the same lesson repeated over and over again in different ways. I sub at a school where the students stay in the same room and teachers move. This book requires you to write A LOT on the board. Yes, this involves turning your back on a class for a long time at the beginning of class. This is not a good idea for any sub's ""survival."" You're better off finding free internet lesson plans in the various subject areas than wasting your money on this book."
1,not too impressed,"The problem I had with this book is that large parts of it are not directed toward the substitute teacher at all. In Chapter 3, he spent most of the time discussing what the regular classroom teacher should do for the substitute, not what the substitute should do with the plans. I have no control over what the regular teacher leaves or what the administration does, so this is not helpful to me at all.I dropped my teeth when he suggested that if a classroom situation becomes untenable, or you start to lose control, you should ""walk"", that is, leave the classroom. Huh? I would never be called back to a school if I were to do that, not to mention that it strikes me as a bit cowardly. The only excuse I could think of to walk out on a class is violence, and then you're going to leave the other kids in there? No way--the pay for subs is low, but I'm a mom as well as a teacher.Some of the advice was good, but overall it's not a useful book."
1,Not reccommended,"A substitute teacher has rules to follow, and the first and main rule is one. STAY IN THE CLASSROOM. Stay with the class, never leave them alone. A book that advises a substitute to leave the classroom is one that is suspect, if not dangerous. It exposes a sub who follows that advice to legal liability and possibly criminal negligence should such advice be followed.In addition to that poor advice the book's lesson plans are a copy-and-paste job, repetitious and dull, and the book tends to be steeped in a political correctness that will not age well."
1,Not at all helpful,"This book is very random and not at all helpful. The cut-and-paste lesson plans are based on specific topics that most likely aren't going to be relevant to the students. And besides, the students won't do the work if they know they won't be graded on it. And the worst advice was to just leave the classroom, or ""walk,"" if the classroom gets out of control. You may as well turn in your badge because you won't be working for the district ever again.A useful book would talk about what to do if the teacher leaves lesson plans that are too short for the time period or no lesson plans at all. Bringing in un-gradable, non-standards-based lesson plans won't cut it. It would be better to just let the kids have study period. There's more advice for the permanent teacher than the sub in the book. But even then, the writing is just random and long-winded. Don't bother with this book."
4,Substitute Teaching Survival Guide,This book has many specific suggestions and good lesson plans. I found it very useful!
2,"I ""Desire""d Results... I Didn't Get Them.","After ""Ride It"" was released, I could tell that the next single from Geri Halliwell was gonna conquer the world. However, ""Desire"" proved me wrong. Peaking at #22 and falling in the charts after that, Geri had reasonably failed.THE SONG: It took me a couple of times to get used to this new ELECTRIC style Geri was bringing, but eventually, I came around. I love this song now. It's a different kind of pop no Spice has ever done before.THE REMIXES: Lame. You need remixes that you just wonder, ""Geez, this really puts a whole new spin on the song... and it's a positive spin!"" Geri's best remixes are the ""Lift Me Up"", ""Scream If You Wanna Go Faster"", and ""Ride It"" remixes. Geri, you shoulda gone to Hex Hector or the Sharp Brothers.Love you, Geri. Love the song, Geri. Hate the remixes. Live and learn, love."
4,A great little book on writing,"This is the best little book I've read and used on business writing. As a teacher I'm always looking for simple, practical guides that will improve my students' and my own business skills. This book gives useful, practical advice and practices exactly what it preaches. Its even clear enough and well written enough for me to use with my Japanese students. This is the kind of guide that should be available on-line and in various language versions. Highly recommended."
3,slippery mat,"I like the idea of protecting the environment. I got my mat, used it for a Pilates class, worked Great!. However a Yoga class with downdog, warrior etc left me slipping and sliding. A freind of mine ordered the mat at the same time, he had the same problem. He rinsed it off 2x thinking that would help. Same results feels like there is oil on it."
4,Pocket reference...,"Good reference without a lot of text or complexity. Illustrations cover the work quite well. A good, alternate reference that's affordable, too. A good book for any nautical library, or the outdoor enthusiast."
4,Good starter book,"If you know nothin' about knots and don't want to become a knot nut, then this is the book for you. Covers a good basic set of knots. The illustrations are quite clear. The book is also inexpensive and small enough to be easily packable.Steve"
3,Hmmmm....,"When I ordered the cd it arrived in a funky plastic sleeve.I have a large collection, and being able to store and categorize my music is essential; unfortunatley the packaging of the cd made it impractical for cataloging. Returned."
4,"For the price, this lens is very good!","The only problems I have with it so far is that it's heavy(which is expected of a lens this big), the auto-focus isn't as fast as my canon lenses, and the lens filter size is enormous. Other than that, this lens take's spectacular photo's for a ""cheap lens."" Even without the image stabilization, it still takes pretty sharp pictures. I used it on a dam on a very windy day and even at 500mm the pictures were tack sharp. It's very heavy so I don't hand hold it that often, but the times that I have, the pictures were sharp. Great buy for all you amateurs and hobbyists, if you can afford a better lens, go for it, but this really is great for the price."
2,but not happy,"lens caps were broken and lot of dust in side the lens,the black coating is missing in some part of the lens. picture taken is ok"
3,Rear lens connector malfunction,"First let me state prior to the rear housing becoming loose prompting me to discontinue use of the lens I loved this product. However, to only get one full year of use out of a product that cost more than $1000 is extremely disappointing. I am not certain if I got a poorly constructed lens or what the issue is, I know I am very cautious with my equipment. It has not been dropped or misused/abused. It just fell apart at the rear housing. What a shame!!!"
3,"Not bad ,For the price great!!!!!","This lens needs a lot of light and I have not had an oppurtunity to shoot it with the ideal light. I want to give it a 4, but I need more time.. I dont think it will be a five... This is a big lens and I have not had much luck hand holding it.. You need a tripod or monopod for sure.. I found the images very soft, but I have seen more experiencef shooters get great photos with some help from photoshop... For the price you can't do much better... I found it useful at f8-f1l at an ISO of 400.. So there is some noise, which can be fixed in photoshop.. I will update this review once I get some light.. so take this with a grain of salt..The bag it came with could have been a little longer so I dont have to take off the hood..Keep in mind I am amateur... I am sure with time.. this will be my 3rd favorite lens in my bag..."
4,Not bad for the money.,"Actually, I'm pretty impressed with this lens, considering the price. It's REALLY heavy for me though, had to upgrade my tripod!"
3,"Good lens, just not 5 star","I have used this lens about three years now. I have a Canon 20D and a Canon 1D Mark II. I use a Bogen 3120 tripod with a Wimberly II head. I have handheld this monster lens quite often. Without image stability, you have to be in the shutter speed range 1/1000"" (no slower). Combine this with high ISO and you are always on the verge of bad noise in your image. That is why I prefer a tripod and remote shutter release. Then you will have few problems. The autofocus is slow on both cameras. Though with the Wimberly II head, panning and following birds while continuously shooting usually results in a few good images. This lens cannot compare to the Canon 500/4 which to me is the 5-star winner, though at 5 times the price. But it is the old adage, good optics cost good money. No such thing as a good optical system that is inexpensive. But this Sigma lens is a good stop-gap until you can afford the best."
4,Great intermediate lens,"This is the lens that is on my camera (Cannon Rebel XTI) the most. It is very versatile. I am still a beginner, but a serious one, and the range it has is very useful. I shoot a lot of wildlife and it is great. It is very heavy so you need a sturdy tripod, although, you can hand-hold this camera, even at the 500 range, in good light and get great shots. One big problem with the lens is it gets a lot of dust on the inside on the internal lens. I have to go get it cleaned every now and then. I am too nervous to take it apart myself. I have had this lens one year and love it very much. It has even taken a couple of spills and still works great."
4,Why to get a BIGMA,"If you are looking at a BIGMA, you are most likely price-conscience. Nothing wrong with that because this lens gives a lot for a little price. In good light, it provides a great pictures. Great ability to change to varying degrees of distance from the subject, making it very versatile. But without IS and good light, it lacks a bit. I love to shoot youth football, and day games are great, but night games are impossible. So if you want to shoot at night, get a Canon IS lens. If you are going to shoot different distances, especially outdoor sports, this is a great lens."
1,Steer clear of this one!,"What was the point of this book? I guess it was to hear the main character spout off an endless barrage of lame, smart-alec quips (which a quarter of the way through was VERY old), listen to him whine about his job and worship his girl friend. His run-ins with the church, KKK, town officials, etc. are quick, dull and without consequence. The supporting characters are lifeless.This book is about as satisfying as having rice cakes for Thanksgiving dinner."
5,Very insightful and accurate!!!,An insightful portrayal of the second largest religious community in the United States. A must read for all who are interested in American pluralism and the future of this country's religious landscape
5,nice,I found this book to be an excellant learning guide for playing the recorder! My fifth grade son understands and uses it.
5,Great Resource for teaching Recorder,"This is a wonderful resource for a music teacher wanting to teach students to play recorder. It starts with simple songs, and gradually introduces more complex music. The CD that comes with the book is excellent. Once students learn a song, I have them play along with the recording and the students experience playing with an accompaniment. The left and right tracks of the recording allow you to isolate the recorder track from the accompaniment."
5,Good!,This is as advertised and will help you begin to learn to play the soprano recorder. It is clear and has a fingering chart in the back.
5,music to play along to,"This is a great book of songs and tunes. Right from the start it has a CD you can play along with, so even when you are only playing one note, you have some good background music to accompany you. This is a great motivator for 5-6 year old children."
4,A Worthwhile Read,"This is the first Jack Du Brul novel I have read and I found it to be very well put together and interesting. It contains a good mix of action with a decent dose of historical background tying it together well. The fact it is set in one of the most unhospitable places on earth, in Greenland adds to the suspense. Philip Mercer the main character of the novel is very likeable and a hero for the new millenium."
4,Great book but...,"A great story, and a great read but please Jack, start checking your details and facts. A submarine weighs exactly the same every time it submerges (archimedes law), having fewer passengers won't make it lighter or faster. I found some of the technical mistakes enormously distracting from a great story, and easily written around. Otherwise, better than Clive Cussler and with some practice may be the next Tom Clancy. Well worth the reading."
2,"Pandora's Curse is BOREDOM! PLAIN, AND SIMPLE","I got only part of the way through this book, and had to put it down...it was so boring! He develops his main character, and his plot, with a bit too much scientific interest, to the point where the story goes nowhere. You get the feeling he only wrote this book to fulfill a contract, or to show off is geological knowledge, and to keep himself busy, that he only threw in the characters, and the story to show off his smarts...not to write an exciting story for the reader's. He obviously tries to copy Cussler's writing style, and story telling abilities, but falls far shy of the mark, as Cussler runs Numa, and has experienced many diving adventures of his own, and writes Pitt, and Austin in as James Bondian clones of himself.DuBrull is a talented author, but doesn't show it in this book. Read instead his ""Vulcan's Forge"" and ""Medusa Stone"", which are much better books."
5,"Dirk Pitt, James Bond, and Indiana Jones rolled into one !!",The newest installment in the adventures of Mercer-mining engineer with no equal- is a wild ride through the frozen tundra and the frigid waters around Greenland. From start to finish this book does not stop! It's like 472 pages on a careening roller coaster. If your an action addict this book is definitely for you. Mercer no sooner gets out of one deadly jam than finds himself thrust into another. I couldn't put this book down and I highly recommend it along with the rest of the Philip Mercer adventures by Jack Du Brul.
4,This would make an excellent movie!,"This is only the second book of Jack du Brull that I'm reading, but already I'm hooked!The plot is not overly complicated, but keeps you at the edge of your seat. As an adventure / suspense story, this is excellent candy floss for the mind!"
2,Cherry-flavored,"I had hoped to get unflavored B-Complex liquid as a component for homemade energy drinks. Unfortunately, this product is cherry-flavored, although that does little to mask the traditional demon's-jockstrap flavor of liquid B-vitamins. It gets two stars instead of one because I am sure it's the genuine thing.If you value your tastebuds and can take pills, skip the liquid, or at least have it straight with a chaser instead of trying to do what I did. There is no masking that taste.Those who are not used to taking B-vitamins, do be aware that it colors your urine a really vigorous, almost electric, yellow for quite a bit of the rest of the day."
1,Don't be Misled,"""Conversations about the art and craft songwriting?"" Hardly.These dated interviews appear culled from author Jeffrey Pepper Rogers bygone days as an editor for Acoustic Guitar magazine and, at best, glance over the craft of songwriting in favor of guitars and guitar technique.This is no ""Tunesmith"" (Jimmy Webb). Nor does it remotely approach the quintessential look at the craft offered in John Braheny's fine ""Craft and Business of Songwriting,"" or the inspired step-by-step approach of song sherpa Robin Frederick's ""Shortcuts to Hit Songwriting.""Rock Troubadours is a conversation about songwriting that goes nowhere."
3,shattering issues,"While the light fixture itself is beautiful, after two different shipments I was unable to receive a product that did not come with broken glass shades. The packaging was inadequate to withstand the shipping process. Maybe you will have better luck."
1,Where's my order?,"Im in agreement! I have yet to receive my order also what concerns me even more is this company is not able provide the customer with shipping info such as how it will be delivered weather by FEDEX , UPS, or USPS besides that this is the longest I think I have waited for a product I ordered to get to me.What makes things worse is the Beauty encounter is hard to reach well it hard to get a customer service person on the line to assist with locating a order. We waited and waited then a recording comes on and tells you no one can be reached then hangs up. I don't know but I imagine this cannot be good for a business esp. not my business. I'm not happy with beauty encounters at all right now.Thank You"
5,A MUST READ!!,"I'll begin by saying this is the first ""war"" book I've ever read. I read it twice, as once wasn't enough to absorb the rich content. The book was great and once I picked it up I couldn't put it down! Don Julin is an exceptional writer. He reaches, teaches and touches the reader. The book allowed me to vicariously experience the war-torn world of the 60's through Mr Julin's elequent voice. I grew up sheltered, never having to face what he and so many others experienced during that time. I'm very impressed at how Mr Julin so fearlessly opened himself up and shared his story. I have gained much insight into what actually occurred,and how it felt, while I was so protected at home. I feel the book will be cathartic and eye-opening for the reader and I'm grateful I had the opportunity to be so affected. I think it is a ""must read"" for all Baby Boomers, women sending loved ones off to Iraq and other far off places and those young people going to war. It's a must read!"
1,Not impressed.,"The post is very shoddy. I wasn't expecting the best for the price but this was a little ridiculous. The post is made up of two different types of carpet--the carpet that matters, the stuff that the cats will scratch at on the sides, is very poor quality and comes off immediately. We've only had ours a few hours and our floor is already covered in litterings from the post.If the cat post were made of the carpet used to line the indentation in the top of the post (which isn't very deep) and the platforms on the inside, I have a feeling this would be a much better product and wouldn't cost much (if any) more to make. However, I'm very displeased with what received."
4,power rake,I use this power rake to dethatch the lawn about every 3 years.The blades wear out and have to be replaced.It is an inexpensive replacement as long as you don't have to buy the blade.
5,Music of the Andalus,"This CD has an outstanding collection of the best Andalusian music I've ever heard. The music is orchastrated on the Arabic maqam. Understanding the lyrics [in Arabic] is a plus, but not necessary to enjoy the music of a majestic erra in Arabic history, full of art, fantasy, and music."
4,Great muwashahat performance!,"The Morkos ensemble is performing some of the classical but yet not very well known muwashahat from the arabo-andalusian traditions. The music as well as the cristal voices of the singers do provide the ""tarab"" (joy in music). There is a violin improvisation which is a real masterpiece. The quality ofthe recording is excellent. I highly recommend this CD for those who like classical arabic music. The different songs and improvisations are too short sometimes (less than 2mn). It's the only negative point."
3,Not what I anticipated...but that's my fault!,"For some reason, I thought these were going to be larger. They are very small...only useful to store small items (think nuts and bolts, paper clips and rubber bands, etc). I'm sure I misread something, but they appeared larger on the website. So the items arrived in good condition, but I didn't have much use for them..."
4,No legend story on this disc - be forewarned,"I bought ""A Celtic Tale"" to replace a copy I had bought years ago that had gone bad. The thing that I liked best about the disc was the legend that was told on the disc, so, boy, was I surprised when the new one I ordered just has the music with no story. The music is very good, but, if you are looking to hear the story, apparently it's been removed from a newer release somehow, and, for what reason I don't know, because it was a good story."
5,"Puts all other ""celtic"" cds to shame","This is by far the most beautiful way to tell the ""Legend of Deirdre"" . . . haunting melodies, beautiful instrumentals. For those who like this type of music, it will be played over and over."
4,neat lil' book.,"Being an admirer and wanna-be creator of DaDa, I found this book amusing. The games were interesting and bizarre, there were lots of pictures, and a lot of artists were included. They are fun to read about and see the examples even if you have no intention of really trying them. ""The Exquisite Corpse"" and ""Directions for Use"" were 2 of the better ones, and they have examples by the original surrealists. The only problem I had with the book was that some of the directions were a little vague. For instance, the picture on page 71 is a double image, but it could have given some clue about how to actually find it - it became frustrating. The games are so unusual compared to what we normally think of as games that more detailed directions are essential. For instance, there are not obvious ""winners"" and ""losers"" in them, they are played for the sake of toying with reality and using imagination to create the unexpected. It's a fun book that's small enough to take with you all the time."
4,Enough to inspure Brian Eno,"This was supposedly the inspiration behind Eno's card decks, and is a very useful tool in its own right. While I don't think you'd necessarily want to do the 'spiritualist' slanted activities that it outlines, if you're able to read between the lines and extrapolate to your own creative activities you'll find a lot of useful inspiration."
3,Not as expected,"The content of this book is more or less what I expected, and was relatively interesting for a single read. However, the printing itself seems cheaply done; the pages appear to be photocopied/facsimiles of an original work. Also, the book is very small, so be aware that you can easily tuck this into a pocket (or lose it on your bookshelf)."
3,Original U.S. Navy WW II Films about Submarines,"This dvd is made up of various U.S. Navy short films documenting service aboard World War II submarines. Some of these documentaries were shown to recruits as they began training for the Silent Service, while others were made mainly for civilians, arguably to boost morale at home and to sell war bonds. None of them show the complete picture of life aboard submarines, but that's understandable given the secrecy in which they had to operate. The dvd could have been made better if it included some more detailed post war films after they were de-classified. If you're looking for an action/adventure film, this one isn't for you. However, if you like history and want to see the kind of fare the Navy was producing during, and shortly after, the war, this dvd provides some good examples."
2,A great classic,This game is awsome. But take note that it needs to be up dated so that it can run on windows 7. If your not running XP or something older your out of luck.
3,"Oregon Trail, Just like when we where kids!",Oregon Trail is just like when we where kids because it IS the same game. The only thing ever done to this game over the last 20 years is that it's been adapted (sort of) to run on newer computers. I had to turn the graphics way down on the computer to get it to run and it periodically crashes still but it has an auto save feature that comes in real handy. Its still a campy game though.
1,NO-VAL Pens Dried Up Overnight,"These pens were OK for the first 3-4 DVD-labeling jobs, but appear to have dried up shortly thereafter (although they were always stored with the caps in place). HI-VAL tech support (inexplicably provided by I/O Magic) provided no useful suggestions and no offer of a replacement. I won't waste my time or money with this company again."
1,Street Weapons,"This was a terrible book, but that came as no suprise to me because Ed Nowicki was just a part-time cop with almost no real street experience. This silly manual doesn't deserve any stars, but that option wasn't available. Let's hear from some real cops, with real experience."
1,Deceptive Advertising,"From the above title, I thought I was ordering a set of 4 mugs. Howver, when the order arrived, there was only 1 mug."
4,Good but exhausting to read,"I think this book fully develops it's theme as only a theologian can do and maybe that is where it is lacking as far as speaking to the majority of the Lord's children as most do not require such an exhautive treatment of a subject and if they do they will buy this book. However, more to the point with less of a wearisome read I feel that, ""Tithing: Low-Realm, Obsolete & Defunct"" is a much better read and hey it's half the price!"
5,lester young at his very best,"this cd shows how sentisive and dynamic LY is. the many alternative takes shows how different he could perform the samwe melody, using minimal changes in intonation and so on"
4,Always Young,"Who could ask for better than good recordings from mature, consummate professionals at (or near) the height of their powers? Young, Clayton, et al. had been around more than one block more than a few times by 1938, when the earlier session was recorded, and a few more by 1944, when the later session was recorded. All are exceptional here, especially Clayton's trumpet work and Eddie Durham's electric guitar work. Some say Lester lost his fire after his unpleasant army experience. His earlier stuff is undoubtedly livelier, even the slow blues, but the later recordings, which seem so port-wine-and-reefer slurred, will simply break your heart. All of the recordings here are ample evidence that Young always played what he felt, and that no matter how it came out, there was greatness in it. High points are ""Countless Blues,"" ""Pagin' the Devil #2,"" ""Three Little Words,"" and ""Good Mornin' Blues."""
2,"Birds, bulls and boats","The music alone rates 4 stars. But someone decided that birds, bulls and boats, and other excruciatingly painful irrelevancy is much more watchable than a tour of the beauty of France. Everything (of no interest), shown from 7 or 8 different angles, camera in, camera out, pan here, pan there. Wading birds so interesting, we make them go backwards as well as forwards. Then only show about 15 seconds of the wonderful Mont St. Michel, not much more on the Loire Chateaux. France has so much more to offer than this superficiality. Video rated only half a star, saved by Chopin."
4,"Love the movie, enjoyed the book","It's a little different from the movie, but I really liked the book. Give it a try."
5,A really cool idea that--oddly--makes a really cool album,"The compilation/ mix is an easily fouled-out concept, and for every No New York there probably a jillion Survival of the Fattests... Bearing that in mind, there's something elegantly simple about letting a band--great in their own right--put together a collection of worthy songs. There was a Mojo some time ago that showed the tracklist to a mix tape that Thurston Moore made for potential members of a then-nascent Sonic Youth; the sequencing, selection, everything was impeccable, and yet it said as much about Sonic Youth as an organism than it did any of the selected bands... In this sense, 'Below the Radio' is a very real Grandaddy album in a strange sort of way. That aside, the individual songs are ALL great; Beulah's 'Burned by the Sun' and Snow Patrol's 'Run' deserve special attention, if only because they throw light on two bands I'd never given particular notice before... Well worth a listen, for fans of Grandaddy and so on..."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Note: THIS IS NOT A GRANDADDY ALBUM. It is a collection of songs by other artists. Of the 15 songs, one is by Grandaddy...the lovely, gently anthemic ""Nature Anthem."" But as for the Fruit Bats...no thanks."
1,A HYMNAL FOR THE AGE,"Our WELS pastor clued us in on what was coming with this hymnal in 1986.Given the power of certain seminary professors, and the shakey hold WELS and its Wauwautosa theology have on Lutheran orthodoxy, it is not surprising that Christian Worship makes obeisance to just about everything coming down the pike these days, from its Church Growth title, to the treacle of Fanny Crosby (""Take the World, But Give Me Jesus""), to the feminist ""inclusive"" language (Hark the Herald Angels Sing now has ""born that WE [not man] no more may die,"" O God Our Help in Ages Past has ""soon bears US ALL [not her sons] away,"" etc., etc., etc.) and, of course, they sliced anthropos (men) off the Nicene Creed! No wonder the ELS quit its participation in the production of this hymnal and - with only 20,000 members - turned out a far better one. What a sad commentary on the naivete and poor judgment of these well-meaning Midwesterners. And the numbers of the WELS continue to decline."
4,Nostalgic Naturalism,Rich & Musso have composed a fulfilling ambient CD which begins with two slow and somber tracks. These set the tone for this wonderfilled collection of individually different slow pieces. With instruments/synths/samples this CD delivers its promice to enter through fissures into a suterranean world. Marginally musical sound compositions linger in no hurry to get anywhere. Lie down and smell the heady forest floor odors of decomposing flora and wet soil. Your eyelids grow heavy on a bed of fragrant lichen. No boredom here as you are ever aware of strange underworldly sounds surrounding you. The last two tracks bring a sence of loneliness and separation through dreamlike visions of naturalism.
3,Organic tension,"This cd reflects a subtle sense of tension among the organic and subterranean sounds. Although not my favorite among Rich's releases, it does have plenty of nice soundscapes. It reminds me a lot of his 1996 release ""A Troubled Resting Place"", yet a far cry from his 1998 release ""Seven Veils""."
1,Wrong item - Don't order if you need 8x,"I ordered these 8x disks specifically because my DVD burner only takes up to 8x disks. True to Amazon form, the disks arrived quickly, but they are 16x. This is the second time I've been burned like this. The last time was another Amazon product marked as 4x and it also was 16x. Can't win!"
4,Cosamin ASU shows promise...,"Cosamin ASU Active People Capsule, 180-CountI have been using this product for 5-6 months (recommended by my son, who is an equine veterinarian, having good results). MY problem is mostly severe pain in the thumb joint of my hands--on two occasions, I was totally disabled for 2 to 5 days. These had happened at 16 month intervals, so I cannot tell if this particular capsule will help me. One of my doctors said that it is mostly proven on knees--as most reviews mentioned. HAS ANYONE FOUND THAT IT HELPS ARTHRITIS IN FINGERS OR LOWER BACK???"
2,Might work if you give it enough time,"I tried this after reading all the fabulous reviews on here. But I am impatient when it comes to my mobility- people seem to take that for granted. I don't have the tolerance or moxie to wait around for something to work. Maybe if I was elderly, but I am young and I feel like I am imprisoned in this useless body.Anyway, sorry for the diatribe, but yea, I took Cosamin for a few weeks, and it did nothing for me, well I lie. It did raise my blood sugars a bit, but I am willing to trade off on high blood sugars for my mobility.The absolute best things for joints is Zymosine and Flexcin. But if you are allergic to shellfish or have diabetes, I would probably stay away from them."
5,A Cook-Book With A Nice Twist,I read this book when it first came out many years ago. It includes the favorite recipies of dozens of stars from diverse fields; from show-business to politics. The author has a nice breezy way of introducing both the celebrities and their recipies. This a fun book and a useful one.
1,"Poor condition, scratches, legs bent. ect.","The sunglasses are supposed to be good. These sunglasses specifically weren't good at all. They had scratches on the several places and the paint was coming off. In addition, the legs were bent. Also, the plastic rubber at the end of the leg was coming off. I'm very disappointed with the quality of this particular item. This should have not been sent in that condition. When I purchased this product on your web-site it doesn't say that they are in poor condition. I really believe this particular item was a fake product."
3,a fine fusion,"The Philip Glass of the Middle East; Kahn and Taschner present a smooth and sometimes mystical blend of Indic-Islamic sound with western-tech and subtle modern overtones. Sometimes intoxicating, most often unobstrusive-lovely, but not too daring, ultimately quite soothing."
2,"Good idea, poor implementation","I thought this would be great ... I would always be able to find the kleenex in the same place, and the box wouldn't get stepped on and smashed. The only problem is that every sheet of kleenex tears in half when you try to pull it out. Apparently, because of the angle it sits, the weight of the full box of tissues falls against the top of the box and doesn't let the top sheet come out easily. I bought a different brand locally for a friend, and he has had the same problem, so it is apparently a design flaw."
2,What size?,The sizing is completely wrong. If you wear a XL you might want to consider buying a medium. The only good thing I can say about this shirt is it pretty and makes a pretty good night shirt.
4,good tv,easy set-up. dvd's look great. there is a slight blurring with sports action if your 6 ft or less from tv. a limitation on lcd response time from what i've read. i'd still recommend it to anyone.
4,"Toshiba 26HLV66 26"" LCD HDTV with DVD Player","The built in DVD is nice. However I'm not real pleased with the picture quality. It may be something I'm missing. I don't know what else to do. I'll take any input. I also purchased a Toshiba 42"" Plasma a few days later. I am very pleased with it."
5,"Funny, Sweet, Beautiful","Big sister Stella is trying to get little brother Sam ready in the morning, but Sam is s-o-o-o easily distracted that it's hard to keep him on task. This book contains one of my kids' all-time favorite lines, uttered by Sam as he tries to pull on a t-shirt, ""My head grew bigger in the night!"" As usual with Marie-Louise Gay books, the art work is beautiful."
4,Ahmad at his finest,"The amount and quality of the music on this disc is astounding. This is Ahmad at his finest. ""Ahmad's Blues"" and ""Autumn Leaves"" are worth the money alone. His groove, touch and use of space is all his own. You won't be disappointed."
5,Refreshing List of Films,"So many ""best of"" film books out there simply re-state lists that you have seen a million times. Most of them are American films that tend to be more mainstream as opposed to international and obscure. ""Icons of Film: The 20th Century,"" however, displays about 80 films chronilogically from 1920 to 1999. The films range for the obscure to the better known, low budget to high budget and across all nationalities. The film descriptions also don't simply describe the films, but their importance to film as a whole. A great, stylish guide."
2,Unsat Performer,"This product is not well designed for even light duty home use. The back plane is so flimsy that slices come out wedge shaped because the top flexes so much. There is a cavity below and in front of the blade that gets food particles in it and is very hard to clean. I used the slicer for Canadian bacon, baked ham and provolone cheese--then I went out and bought another brand product. Hope someone on Ebay will like the Deni ""Classic""...Bud Caldwell"
4,Nice and Compact...but not for everyone,"I have used this camera only for a day or two. Picture quality is really good. The photo quality is great, almost as good as a stand alone digital camera.This camera is ideal for someone with small hand size. Otherwise please try it before you buy. The hand strap can be VERY uncomfortable. I have already felt it on the first day of use.Not a great feel to hold it. Other than that no major complaints so far.Please do not buy the SC 2000 case from Canon. That case is way too big for this tiny camera."
4,"hot lesbian sex, all sorts of situations","this is a collection of all the erotica that OOB has published over the last 10 years or so, and that wasn't included in v1 of their best of.the stories are mostly hot and arousing, maybe 1 or 2 are not. but, everyone's opinion is different.i like this book because the writing IS good. the stories are original, and different types and 'flavors' of lesbians are featured."
5,"My first Hillerman book, it made me buy all the others!",The Joe Leaphorn mysteries by Tony Hillerman have become one of my favorite reads. I never thought that I would be interested in mysteries set on an indian reservation but this book changed all that. After reading this book I found and read every Hillerman book I could find and watch the lists for new ones. I have also learned a lot about reservation life and have a new-found respect and understanding of what life is like for the American Indian today. Kudos to Tony Hillerman!
4,Oldie But Goodie,"I read these stories before. I loved them so much I wanted to give them to a friend who had not experienced Tony Hillerman's books. The used book was indeed ""acceptable"" as indicated in the description. The price was very good for so many stories in a hard cover. However, I wish the type had been bigger, and the pages less yellow. I hope my friend enjoys these stories as much as I did. I am still very pleased with my selection."
4,portfolio presentation for fashion designers 3rd ed,Is a decent text book. It provides the necessary information and tools to develop a professional fashion design portfolio. I will be using it more as time goes on.
4,must have for fashion design student's-Seneca fashion alumni,"This book was recommended in design class. It provides good illustrations on how to set up your portfolio showing many examples of fashion students work. It instructs on how to do technical sketches which every student needs to know. It prepares you for interviewing by instructing on how to write cover letters, resumes, and how to handle interviews. There is a lot! of valuable info in this book. The more you read it the more you find."
4,Memories,"My mother had a set of Franciscan Apple dinnerware as I was growing up, though I never thought too much about what I was eating off of at the time. Later, as a wife and mother myself, I was looking for a theme around which to decorate my kitchen. We had just moved to Appleton, WI (16 years ago) so I decided to use an ""apple"" theme, w/o even connecting the idea with my mom's dishes. I was frankly surprised to visit my parents and become reacquainted with the Franciscan dishes. Over the years I've collected innumerable apple items, but my goal is to have a set of Franciscan apple dishes of my own! They do chip, but they last forever and retain their color beautifully."
5,FABULOUS VINTAGE PATTERN,"We inherited a collection of vintage Franciscan Apple that have decorated our china hutch for almost 20 years. Recently I searched for an everyday dinnerware for my family of 5. After weeks of searching, I chose the ""still available after 65 years"" Apple pattern. In addition to the microwave, dishwasher safe, freezer safe attributes, I love the fact that these dishes are NORMAL size. My service for 12 actually fits in the cabinet and in the dishwasher. The dishes are smaller and lighter weight than most patterns available today. Hurray! Who needs a coffee cup that is so large you can't drink it before it gets cold or a cereal bowl that looks like a mixing bowl. The lighter weight is easier for children to handle so we have few accidents. And, I love the variety of open stock accessories still available. After 20 years, we still love MeMa's old Apple Dishes..."
2,Not your mother's Franciscan Ware,"My single place setting of Franciscan ""Apple"" arrived today in good condition from Amazon. I was disappointed to see that they had little similarity to the older Apple dishes in my kitchen cabinet. There is no manufacturer indicated anywhere on the box or dishes except that they are made in Thailand. The dinner plate is slightly larger than the traditional size and it is very deep bearing some slight resemblance to a large soup bowl. They are slightly embossed, but without the detail of the originals. The paint is darker and more intense and , in general, does not match my existing set in most ways...and they cannot be stacked with the older dishes. I will probably use them as serving pieces since they are ""unique"" shall we say."
4,Guter Kauf!,"Dieses kleine, preiswerte Büchlein listet wirklich alle grundlegenden Informationen auf, die man benötigt, um sich einen Gesamtüberblick zu schaffen - leider sind alle Fotos in s/w und leider sind auch keine Detail-Fotos vorhanden. Ansonsten: Empfehlenswert!"
3,Are they chelated?,I would like to know whether the Chromium and the Vanadium in this product are chelated. Can you please include this information?
1,Don't waste your time.,"Not sure where to start there are so many negative things to say about this poorly made film. There were portions of this film where the camera shake was severe and made me dizzy! The sound quality would range from very poor to good, but when it was poor it was difficult to hear. Some of the acting was ameturish. I wonder why I bought this so called movie."
2,Do not buy it if you expect Douglas.,"Creatures from all walks of life are included, not just cats. Stories are s--l--o--w and scattered. These are a collection of short stories that have no relationship with one another or to Douglas' work. Be informed. I read through it, and immediately sold it to a used book store."
3,Not like her others...,"I was quite disappointed with this book. I am a longtime fan of Ms. Ray and rushed to the store to get this one. This time, Ms. Ray's Grayson family seemed a bit on the immature side. With the meetings of the single siblings and the extreme measures taken to avoid the matriarch of the family, Mrs. Grayson, this book did not have much time to develop the main characters and their romantic involvement. Also frustrating me was the mystery of Phoenix's past and how she dreaded Morgan's discovery - but yet, she blurted it out to him in all of 5 seconds. So what was the purpose? I haven't even finished the book. I was too frustrated with Ms. Ray's writing style in this book. I'll wait to read the reviews on Ms. Ray's next one before purchasing."
1,Extremely Disappointed :-((,"I am a huge fan of Francis Ray's books and I love the Taggart/Falcon/Grayson series, so I was really looking forward to this book. What a letdown. The first chapter had great promise, but it all went downhill from there.The writing was poor - stilted, unnatural conversations and lots of repetitions. There was no chemistry between Morgan and Phoenix. The constant protests of the siblings against marriage and Morgan falling in love got old very quickly. It was annoying, unreasonable and silly.It was great to catch up with Luke and Daniel, but they didn't even sound like the men we've come to know and love. Every word out of Luke's mouth was about the wonders of love. Sure, they love their wives, but when did they become simpering idiots??I will still read Ms Ray's books because I think that she is a very talented writer and storyteller (read The Turning Point), but this book was a huge disappointment."
4,"Always a Fan, But a little Disappointed","Although I love Francis Ray and enjoy her books. I couldn't help being a little disappointed with this one.It was diffently missing ""something"" that I had always enjoyed in her other books. I have always read her past books more then once. This book I know I wont. I am and always will be a fan of your's Ms. Ray and look foward to your future books. Take Care and God Bless"
5,"""I Enjoyed It""","I'm new to the Falcon/Grayson series, and this was a nice novel to read. I just ordered the ""Falcon Saga"" and I can't wait to read that as well. I gave this novel ""five stars"" because of the romance, but I can see similar writing styles with Ms. Ray and fellow novelist Brenda Jackson. Case in point: the bachelor auction, being Native-American, it's the same as Brenda Jackson's ""Surrender"", and let's not forget the fact that everyone is wealthy, gorgeous, have bodies to die for, the women have hair down their backs, everyone is related and have connections, and in all the families it's older brothers and the baby sister. Did Ms. Ray and Ms. Jackson compare notes or something? Out of all the Grayson brothers, Brandon is my favorite because of his sense of humor. Ms. Ray you're a great writer, but you should stick with your own writing style and stay unique."
5,Love Overrules All,"This story was the bomb, Phoenix and Morgan were attracted to each other right from the start, but deception, and secrets of Phoenix past threatened to keep them apart. Phoenix is an artist who's life is steeped secrets lies, and betrayal from her past.Morgan is a man who wants nothing to do with marriage, but at the same time finds himself attracted to Phoenix, wanting know more about her. As the story prgrogresses Morgan , and Phoenix find that they can't deny their attraction, they become involved, but Phoenix somewhat reluctant, throughout the story we find out why do to her past. Morgan finds himself doing every and anything to keep Phoenix in his life, it is Morgan who is able to help Phoenix move on from the past. He is her hero!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of Her best,You and No Other was wonderful I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it and I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out a Francis Ray Must have
5,Secrets!!!!!,"As usual, Francis Ray has done it again. This book was excellent. This is the follow-up to ""Until There Was You"", this is about Morgan Grayson, a handsome attorney determined not to fall for his mothers matchmaking schemes. Morgan then meets Phoenix a woman with some secrets. Despite Phoenix's reserved attitude Morgan can't seem to stay away from her. When her secret comes to light will this be the end of a promising relationship, or will Morgan fight to save the woman he's fall in love with?????????"
4,Loved It!,"While around awhile, I only just began reading Francis Ray books. I was introduced to her writing while reading a copy of Della's house of style. I just finished You and No other, and I can't wait to see what is in store for Brandon, Pierce and Sierra!!! While the stories aren't overly realistic - that is what I love about them. Enjoy!"
2,Monotonous,"I usually like the family series, but these are somewhat predictable and jump to different scenes without warning. Being that this is a 21st century romance, it is somewhat lacking with respect to details in love scenes and sometimes character thoughts seem to make little sense. The series are written with realism, but shy away from the details where they really count in order to make the story balanced, stick and flow."
4,I enjoyed it too.....,"Lovely story, quite funny as well with the single Grayson siblings all trying to avoid their mother and Morgan spouting off 'I am not gettting married' ever so often. However the inevitable does happen and yes there are similarities with Surrender but there are enough differences to make the story its own. The Svengali character was a bit one dimensional but glad to see him get his comeuppance but I do get a bit irritated with heroines with no backbone but in this case Phoenix was quite young, only 19 when she had her unfortunate experience (read the book to find out what it is)."
4,Excellent Reference,"This is an excellent reference book for the gun enthusiast. It includes one picture per model shown, specifications such as weight, length, etc., safety, loading and unloading instructions, etc. I personally would have liked more info, specially regarding countries in which it is in service, overall performance, etc."
1,INEXCUSABLE RIP-OFF! Contains no popular guns I've ever had!,"Complete rubbish!I looked for the guns I've owned -- modern, popular guns, and they're not in there! There are VERY few guns in there! They don't show one single gun I've ever owned!They mention the Colt Mustang Plus II as a variation, but don't show it. They don't show the Colt AR-15 Lightweight Sporter (or the other one I've seen, a .23), and they don't even mention other guns I've had -- a Tek-9, 2 Davis pistols, and a Lorcin LT-25.The organization could hardly be worse. The pieces are listed by the model name, not the manufacturer, and there doesn't seem to be any alphabetical order to them by manufacturer in each section.The book, ""first printed"" in 2000 and ""Fully updated,"" talks about something that's supposed to happen come 1995.Waste of money!"
5,You can also hear the author every week on the radio!,"Yedida Cohen gives beautiful short lectures in Kabbalah (10 minutes long) every week on The Eyshet Chayil Show through Israel National Radio, which you can hear for free on the internet.[...]If you like this book, listen to her lively, soulful explanations of kabbalistic concepts every week."
5,Enlightenment,"As one unfamiliar with Hebrew history, this book by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag is a bolt of lightning to your entire being, illuminating a hidden and ancient wisdom. Once you start reading, you can't put the book down because the wisdom and truth of what is revealed is addictive. I am humbled, honored and very privileged to have been able to read this spiritual work and look forward to furthering my study of Kabbalah.Anyone who is searching for the truth of why we are here, glimpses of God's creative powers, why there is good and evil, please read ""In the Shadow of the Ladder; Introductions to Kabbalah"" by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag.It is a revelation that will fill you up to overflowing with the most wonderful feeling/knowledge that even though things are not ""right with the world"" God is in control and always will be."
4,Song of the Irish Whistle or Song of the Irish Whistle Vol. 2,"Joanie Madden is great and does a wonderful job. The CD is great! The supplier did a prompt job on sending. But, I ordered Volume 2, in that I already had Vol. 1.The instructions from Amazon were not clear and Volume 1, not Volume 2 was shipped.This was a communications and not a supplier problem."
5,I enjoy listening to this album over and over again!,"Joanie Madden is a widely respected Irish-American flutist and Irish (or Penny) Whistle player. She specializes in Irish music, and has produced three albums, of which this 1996 album is her second.This is a very nice album, filled with relaxing music with a distinctively Irish flare. It makes great Saturday morning music, filling the house with wonderful notes while I go about my cleaning. I enjoy listening to this album over and over again!"
3,Not so scarey,"The book was very good, but I did not like the ending. It didn't live up to some of R.L. Stine's other work."
4,a review from a 15 year old girl in clinton ct.,"Bad dreams was a vary good written book. I finished it in about 2 days. The Beging and middle where the best parts of the book the only thing that I did not like about the book was the ending! I suggest the you take the time to read this book, the best place to read ""Bad Dreams"" is at night with a flash light!"
5,Unpredictable!,"You could never guess what would happen to Maggie next. This book was unpredictable and exciting, at the same time it was so scary"
2,seaira's review,"Bad dreames was a very good book. I have read many fear street booksby R.L. Stine, but this one wasen't as good as half the others. The ending just made the book cheesey, the plot was very good, and so were the dreams.I gave this book 2 stars because that's all it is worth."
5,Sweet dreams Maggie...,This was my first Fear Street book I read and it scared me! I was scared of going to sleep! If I would have a dream that would keep repeating I would stop sleeping! But I love this book anyway.Sweet dreams...
2,boring..,"I was pretty interested in this book since i saw so many positive reviews but i was sooo disappointed. I read halfway and was really bored with it because it didnt seem scary at all! I decided that RL Stines books all start off kinda boring anyway, but get way better later on. Well, this book just didn't improve or keep my interest..and the ending was really random."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"I read the book in less than an hour. I couldn't put it down! It's a thrilling story about a girl, her sister, and her mother moving to a house after they experience some financial problems. The only item the previous owners left behind in the house was a beautiful 4-poster antique bed. However, everytime the main character sleeps in the bed, she experiences the same haunting dream of a girl getting murdered in the bed. Soon, she discovers the truth of what happened in that house, and when the truth starts to come true... well, you're just going to have to read the book to find out! Happy haunting!"
2,"Had potential, but...fell short","When I began reading this book, I thought that I was going to be scared out of my mind, seeing as how it supposedly had to do with dreams. As I got further into the book, expecting a lot from it, well, it didn't meet my expectations. The creepy factor was about a one out of ten, and the suspense was about a four. As for the overall book, RL Stine tried to give off a twisted ending, but all the 'twisted' ending did was make the book even more stupid. Not worth it."
5,Surprisingly good!!!,"At first I thought I wasn't going to like this book, but then I thought I may as well read it because of what other people said here. The overall story was okay, but I could have never guessed the ending!!! It has to be out of the top 10 Fear Street Books I've ever read. It was really good."
3,Average,"A good book, especially if you are addicted to the Fear Street series. I am nearly 20 and nearly finished at university, and I'm still reading these books. The ending is literally impossible to guess."
4,It was good!,I have read afew of the Fear street Books and if you are starting out you should read this book first. It wasn't as grusome as the others and still is very suprising at the end.
5,This was a really good book,I just got done reading this book and it was really good and I would recommend this book to anyone that likes r.l. stine books or use to read them when they were growing up
3,"Some Roach, reminiscent of the old ambient days...","Steve Roach returns with his signature space music style, with many similarities to his 1992 album World's Edge. Although not as moving as Structures From Silence or Quiet Music, old and new fans will enjoy putting this CD on for deep contemplation and reflecting. Definitely worth your hard earned money..."
4,Dark and continuously flowing...,"I love dark ambient music but am fairly new to the music of Steve Roach at this time. This album was my introduction to his music, and I like it very much. It is unusual in that after the first listen, I could barely remember anything that I'd just heard even though it went for over an hour. It is just a steady stream of dense, metallic strings, drones, sub-harmonic resonance, heavily reverbed noise and dissonant chords. There is hardly anything that resembles a melody of course, not that it's a bad thing, but I'm quite amazed - the fact that there are hardly any melodic fragments at all! Just thick texture. My personal favourites are ""Between the Gray and the Purple"", ""Infinite Shore"", ""Cloud of Unknowing"" and ""The Magnificent Void"". This CD is quite unlike any other in my collection and one that I'm glad to have found."
3,"VERY ATMOSPHERIC, BUT TOO LONG","I have been a Roach fan since I heard his collaborative album with Jorge Reyes and Suso Saiz called Suspended Memories, and I think this album is probably one of my least favorites. No doubt, there are some beautiful sounds on here, but not enough. I guess he's staying true to the concept of the ""void,"" which is cool. It is a work of art. As with all Roach art, it is best understood when listened to with hi-fi headphones, lying down and closing your eyes. It is a trip!"
3,Somwhat cold and distant,"Steve Roach is one of my favorite ambient artists. However, this particular release reveals absolutely nothing original or even particularly interesting. The soundscapes are rather flat and alienating. The final track, at 20 minutes, finally kicks up some interest, but is also the track that leaves me feeling the most alone and slightly anxious. I guess I can say that this cd lives up to its title."
1,Dark & Void,"I'm a fan of much of Steve Roach's work. 'Dreamtime Return' is still a favorite. But 'Magnificent Void' has none of the magical quality of those discs, and is downright dark. The repetitive bass notes and rumble might be nice for a sci-fi horror movie. But it makes for boring listening. Pass on this one."
2,This Cd Is Perfect.......UGH!!!,".....when you've had guests over for the evening & they've started to stay past their welcome.......all the booze has been drunk......the conversation has dried up.......the clock is about to reach Midnight.......but they WON'T leave......turn the topic of conversation around to ""experimental"" music & throw on Steve Roach's ""The Magnificent Void"". I guarantee that they'll be grabbing their coats & heading towards the door after 5 minutes of listening to this particular cd!This one is a big zero. It has all the charm of a diesel truck engine idleling outside your window...... Sorry Steve, but I guess you can't hit a home run all the time!"
1,One of the worst ambient album ever,"Well, I do not pretend to be a musical expert, but I do have a substantial collection of ambient CDs including Pete Namlook, Tetsu Inoue, Michal Stearns, some early Tangerine Dream, Vangelis works etc. In my collection theres cca. 250 ambient CDs. And this is defintely the worst. If the point was to design a feeling of ""void"" then this Steve Roach's CD is a great expression of voidness of inspiration. You'll find on this CD a lot of sounds which do not inspire any emotion at all, as the entire CD is composed as sequel of sounds with no deepness, with no emotion, with no any sens at all and without any message. If the music do not inspires anything, then it's usless to listen it at all."
5,beautiful space trip,"This is a beautiful soothing cd, like floating in the solitude of space. Deep, haunting, imagination music."
3,"Ambient yes, but rather dull","I bought this album and Rich/Lustmord's ""Stalker"" at the same time, and to me there's no comparison. Stalker is deep, rich and interesting while still being very tranquil and ambient. The Magnificent Void is just too ambient for my tastes--there's not a lot of interest for me in the soundscapes. The recording is beautiful, yes--but while it's very relaxing to listen to ambient music I don't actually want to be bored. This one is rather boring to me, though I'm not giving up on it yet--it's just that with headphones on, Stalker is the one I'd rather listen to, and the one I'd excitedly recommend."
5,His Finest!,"This is my favorite cd I own, and I own about 1000. This has been with me during the dark and happier times. My companion, so to speak. It is dark, but it's a modern day symphony, an opus dark, wet and ethereal in texture. Of the near 40 cd's I own of Steve Roach, this makes it to my player the most often. Don't miss it, if you liked STALKER by RICH, this is better."
5,High quality case,"A very high quality case, and while it's a little bulky for a front pocket - it has a really nice velcro belt loop. It fits the Canon PowerShot SD1000 very nicely with room for an extra battery and memory card."
3,Sad,"I really love this case and it's hard to give it up, but it just isn't long enough for my Canon Powershot SX210. My camera has a 9:16 aspect ratio lcd which makes it just a little too long to be fully protected by this case, the velcro barely makes contact with itself when I try and close it. I'm posting this review only because I was referred to this case by another reviewer in the posts below my camera model here on amazon. It's truly sad that it does not fit, because I just hate zippers and leather and now I'm having a tough time finding a suitable alternative."
1,camera case,"Even though this case was on the Amazon page with the Canon SX210is, the camera does not fit. Went to Walmart for one.????"
5,"Witty, irreverant and down-to-earth 'How-To' book","This fun little book offers witty, irreverant and utterly practical advice for choosing a great husband. By comparing different types of men to cars, Nelson and Justice highlight the merits and drawbacks of sporty roadsters, reliable sedans and road hogs. The authors correctly observe that not everyone really wants to drive a Mercedes. They genuinely appreciate the benefits of pickups and Camrys and help the readers move past the 'handsome and rich' stereotype to the kind, reliable and trustworthy qualities that really matter in a marriage.While this book's 'been there, done that' tone may not hit home with the starry-eyed romantic, it's a perfict fit for the 30+ still-looking or the once-married 'smarter this time' woman.There are plenty of good men out there once you know what to look for, and this book can help you recognize one."
5,GREAT contribution!,"""This book is a GREAT contribution! It is practical, funny, and outlines an objective approach to shopping for a husband. It provides the brain with a role in the selection process instead of leaving matters to the hormones. My step daughter needs this book to prevent another disaster."""
4,Insightful!,"Funny and very true! Very valuable tool if you are in search of husband material, even if you are not, this book is a must-read! It will enlighten you!"
4,An excellent but not thorough collection,"This is the only CD album of the classic Commodore jazz artists and as such, it is very valuable. My only quarrel is in the selection of artists and limitation of their offerings. George Brunies, Eddie Edwards' Original Dixieland Band,and Wild Bill Davison are deserving of more tunes. With the LP and EP albums virtually non-existent, these samples are fabulous to tell the Commodore story. I only wish more of the individual artists were on CDs."
5,Franciscan Appleware,"Exactly what we were looking for and exactly as advertised. VERY fast shipping, which I appreciated during the holiday season."
1,Poor organised and very uneven in quality,"This is quite a poorly organised book. Certainly I found it sloppy and longwinded in equal measure. Is anyone editing these Training from the Source books, I asked myself. In any training manual. a good mental model should be easily extracted. This is far from the case here. The manual and tutorials that accompany Authorware are preferable to this volume's offerings. It is simply too erratic and patchy to meet the objective set in the title. I would not recommend it."
1,Even worse than the last book.,"The 5 book was bad. This one is even worse. Don't waste your time or money. This was no more than an update to the last, and it doens't even fully go into the new functions, missing many inportant aspects and abilities of one-touch-publishing, integrating Flash, etc."
1,"Once again, Magnavox stinks","Beware of this product, as the DVD player will stop working whenever you least expect it. Stay away from Magavox for quality products!"
2,Beware! DVD player is faulty on some units!,This is a combo DVD/VCR unit and if it weren't for the DVD player that doesn't work i'd give it four stars. Apparently the DVD player has software issues and Magnavox/Phillips is aware of them but continues to sell the product. The manufacturer has a one year exchange warranty but then you have to deal with shipping the thing across the country and at your own cost by the way. Considering how heavy it is you may be better off buying a different model from a manufacturer who cares about quality control and customer satisfaction. But if you want to take your chances i loved the A/V inputs in the front and the sound is pretty good.
1,Not bad ... considering it doesn't WORK!,"Just bought this today at Target (1/7/2003). Going to return it tomorrow. It promises a nice all-in-one but like several of the other posters, something doesn't work on it. In my case, the VCR. I bought this on a spur of the moment without doing any research. Got home, set it up, went to Amazon to see the reviews, ... wish I hadn't bought it. It sounds good enough, though. And if everything worked well, I might have kept it longer. But with the on-line reviews here and it not working out of the book, I'll have owned it for less than 24 hours. *sigh* My recommendation is to NOT buy this product."
1,Don't buy this.,"I thought this combo would be a great deal because of the price, the ease of use, etc, but it isn't because it doesn't work. My problem was the DVD player decided to freeze at random points on all my DVDs - even brand new ones. I'm returning it today."
3,Flaky DVD Player,"I bought this product from Target a little over a year ago. We use the DVD player maybe once to twice a month at most. About 2 months ago (just after the warranty expired - imagine that), the DVD player would start freezing and locking up after a certain period of time. Maybe 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. Very disappointed with this. I read something about this being a program issue or something in this machine. Otherwise, it works great, too bad I bought it for the DVD player. I think magnavox should be held responsible in some way."
1,Ours broke too,"I don't write many reviews but had to agree with everyone else here - our DVD player broke. This was a gift, unfortunately it's sitting gathering dust in the basement now."
5,Quick and dirty summary information,This book gives you enough to be dangerous. Not enough real world examples and information is at a high summary level. Great book for FYI of what Developer is and what it can do . . . If you need to be able to develope don't bother buying it.
2,An Oracle Developer Overview. Not Technical,This book is only useful for IT managers or those who only want a high level overview of Developer. Needs more practical code examples.
5,Witty and insightful!!!,"Gawd it's nice to read a technical book that doesn't assume you have to be shown every screen and button click. It gives the straight dope on NCA, Forms 5.0 and Reports 3.0. Loved the anecdotes!"
2,Only for the beginner,This book is best for the beginner. Those of us who have worked with Oracle Forms for some time will not find answers in this book for more advanced questions and will often end up taking a different book off the shelf. I do like the Object Properties charts in Appendix A though - they are useful for quick information at a glance.
5,"Fauré's Sonata, as written by Dukas...",".Fauré--the greatest of all French composers--wrote much excellent piano music; however, he did not essay that most important of genres the piano sonata. It sounds here as if Dukas wrote Fauré's Sonata for him. In other words, Dukas' Sonata sounds remarkably Fauréan--which is a good thing.This Sonata of Dukas falls in with the general ethos of many others of the post-Wagnerian post-Franckian Franco-Belgian school of the turn-of-the-century (e.g., Caplet, Tournemire, Magnard, Cras, Lekeu, Vierne, Pierne, d'Indy, and of course Faure, et al.).It's a very fine piece in the ultra-rare key of eb-minor. One of Scriabin's early sonatas is in the same key, and in fact this piece has many Scriabinesque inflections. Dukas' Sonata is a large excellent work and absolutely worthy of a prominent place in the repertoire..Dukas: Complete Piano MusicDukas: Piano WorksFRENCH MUSIC: FROM THE DEATH OF BERLIOZ TO THE DEATH OF FAURE."
5,Jake and the neverland pirates: jake saves Bucky,"My son loves this movie, he watches it almost every day. It has a good story line and many other episodes to watch."
5,"Jake DVD, a favorite of young children!","My three-year-old grandson loves watching Jake and the Neverland Pirates at my house but doesn't have satellite television at home, so I was really happy to find this DVD on Amazon. His parents don't have to worry about violence, because the Jake series is geared toward toddlers and preschoolers and is very innocent. It's very sweet with a positive message."
4,Tuu - 'Mesh' (Hearts Of Space),"Looks to be Tuu's second of four(4) releases they'd put out. About as good as their 'Terma' CD (see my review). This music would be best categorized under -ambient techno-. 'Mesh' offers it's listeners some rather indepth aural pleasures with it's sedated drones, deeply-layered keyboards and hypnotic yet, almost eerie rhythms. Most mesmerizing cuts here are the new-age like ""Crack Between The Worlds"", the pure ambient gem ""Migration"", the twelve minute title track ""Mesh"" and the somber ""Four Pillers"". Thought the flutes, gongs, didgeridoo, synthesizer, sampling, e-bow and bells used to create 'Mesh' were put to good use. Might appeal to fans of Loop Guru, The Orb, Biosphere and Aphex Twin."
2,A Complete Waste of Time and Money,"This DVD is just a poor quality seminar presentation which lacks substance, in fact there is very little here that anyone could not learn from ebay's own tips on the website. The first ten minutes are spent on telling you statistics about eBay. We all know eBay is the largest auction site, we all know it's one of the largest sites online.Adam then goes on to say things like ""feedback is really important"" and ""pick a category that your item fits into"". Come on, surely this is the most basic stuff?Sure, Adam is an excellent presenter who is entertaining, but if you want to learn how to work the ebay system to make money, don't waste your time with this DVD. I kept waiting for the 'meat' of the material, the real 'how to' content, but sadly it never came."
5,Make Millions with your Clutter!,"Entrepreneur and power-seller extraordinaire Adam Ginsberg presents Buying and Selling on eBay, a layman's guide to the cultural phenomenon that is eBay. In his guide to this ""worldwide business opportunity"", Ginsberg offers simple explanations of feedback, what can and can't be sold, and services such as [...] as well as a step by step guide to listing on [...], inventory management, how to create good listings, and home business/tax strategies for the burgeoning power seller.After almost 2 hours of Adam's tips, even the technophobes among us will be scouring attics, basements and offices to find more and more unusual and adventurous bric-a-brac to put up for sale."
4,"Well-designed enclosure, problem with eSATA","I'm a big fan of the Icy Dock enclosures. They are solid and well constructed. I have used two different models at work for the past few years. The problem I have had is with eSATA. On my Dell OptiPlex 755 mini-tower, if I use the Icy Dock with the eSATA port, and a Western Digital Black 1 TB drive, it will occasionally lock-up my machine. If I run the drive as a second internal drive, or with the USB cable on the Icy Dock, I have no issues. Only the eSATA causes the problem. If I had another enclosure I could figure out if it was the Dell or the enclosure."
5,Classic American w/ Global Reach,"In his debut film Salmagundi, up and coming filmmaker Max Robinson, founder of Thinking Dog Productions creates an outstanding and insightful documentary short film. Salmagundi directly deals with American identity. The film asks the perennial question that every generation of Americans ask: ""What does it mean to be an American?"" Salmagundi is an excellent film for discussion and instruction at both the secondary and post secondary levels as well as for entertainment viewing. Rarely does one find a filmmaker that so poignantly captures the foundation of a country's heart. Mr. Robinson's depth, clarity and focus promise to make Salmagundi more than just another short documentary film, but rather an unforgettable one. Film connoisseurs from around the globe would be wise to watch this young filmmakers budding career. I highly recommend Salmagundi without reservation."
5,Hinged Elevatred Tolet Seat,"I have had both hips and now in the process of having both knees replaces, whin I had the first hip replaced I use the seat elevator that was given to me by my insurance which I did not like so I went out looks and found this one and it has been a great replacemnet to that single piece thing I was given, this one has the lid and a lift up seat when makes it so much better to clean, I would highly recommend it to anyone that is going to have or has had a knee or hip replacement it sure make it a lot nice to go take care of your business"
3,Not pleased,"Very dissapointed. I thought that this was going to be just like the picture with a lid. It does not come with a lid, if I would have known this I would have bought a different one and cheaper. This was too much for what they were asking for it.Displeased costumer."
5,Very pleased....,I was so happy to find my mother's favorite cook book. The book is in much better condition than I expected! I love being able to find the perfect gifts whether they are used or new by using amazon.com!
5,so happy,"This was the cookbook I grew up with. The condition was great, especially for such an old cookbook. The only two pages missing were the same ones that were missing in my Mom's book too (the first two pgs.)-haha! The rest of the book is immaculate and even had the old school front and back flaps that protect the pages from flopping around-even my Mom's didn't have those! You sent me a piece of my childhood - thank you."
3,broke back betty,the pages look decent but the spine is broken has tear about three inch from the bottom on cover. Thought it would be in better shape for $100.00 spine is rough
3,Betty Crocker cookbook,"I didn't realize that the book was a three ring binder cookbook. I thought it was going to be a bound book. I have decide to keep it, however, since the info within is what I needed."
4,Holliday is delightful in this wacky comedy!,"When Judy Holliday died in 1967, long before her time, she hadn't been on the silver screen in years. That was a real tragedy for filmgoers, because she was one of the most underrated, under-appreciated actresses of 1940s-50s Hollywood. In 'It Should Happen To You,' a woman comes to New York City wanting to make a name for herself, and starts off big by splashing her name onto Midtown Manhattan's largest billboard. Instant celebrity follows, and she inevitably becomes so well-known that some greedy guys covet her prime advertising spot. But not-so-nitwit Holliday goes on to win the day -- and our hearts. Any movie she appears in is a gem, but the perennial 'wacky blonde' is never so delectable as in this Holliday classic. The actress has a style all her own, that of the street-smart dingbat with a heart a mile wide, and she never disappoints. This video is definitely worth buying, keeping and viewing again and again!"
2,Weak And Overrated,"This movie is very stupid. It is made for somebody with the mentality of a bee. While other rewiewers rave about it, I myself think it is dumb and overrated. Judy Holliday is not the least bit funny, just annoying. So is Jack Lemon. It has a very weak storyline and very few funny parts. If you are looking for a dumb, weak movie, check this one out. If you are looking for something funny, get Jingle All The Way instead."
4,This sign reads: Judy Holliday and Jack Lemmon,"Pete (Jack Lemmon) meets a blond lady, Gladys, in Central Park. She lost her job modeling girdles today. She wants to be somebody and has her dreams. She realizes she might have to marry the first or second guy that asks her.Pete films documentaries, people and things of interest. Today is Gladys' lucky day because Pete just filmed her legs in the park. She sees an outside ad, a space for rent. She buys it and has her name painted on the huge billboard sign at Columbus Circle.Just wait until you see what happens next!Also in the cast: John Saxon, Peter Lawford, Frank Nelson, Whit Bissell, Constance Bennett, Wendy Barrie.This is John Saxon as a boy in his first acting job. This is Jack Lemmon's first feature film.Movie is in black & white.Option of subtitles in English, Spanish, France.DVD brought to you by Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment."
4,Flame D'Amore,"The Flame D'Amore wine glasses are beautiful. I know this. This is why I was adding to my set. However, what I received were goblets, not the wine glasses I ordered."
3,"Great Food, But Wrong Product Shipped","It's hard to give an accurate review to this product since what is being shipped is the brand and variety of the food pictured, but is labelled for use with larger birds.ZuPreem food is great and my Quaker Parrot loves the real small bird variety, but the pieces for larger birds are too big for him to eat, so we have had to grind the food into smaller size chunks.Until Amamzon fixes this fulfillment problem I'd buy with great caution. As long as you get what is pictured on the product page you will be very happy.By the way, Amazon customer service adjusted my account when notified of the problem."
1,Woefully Inadequate,"Design flaw - the blade guard is too deep - very small capacity - because of blade guard you can't fit a whole onion in the compartment, and it is extremely difficult to put back together with contents to be chopped.Needs a redesign - buy the Kitchenaide one!"
3,Fan Bracket,"Bracket came as it was supposed to. I purchased it and it was what I ordered. Although I found it locally much cheaper and I didn't have to wait forever for shipping. So I bought it locally, but this one was as I ordered. My bad not theirs>"
2,Does Billy have arthritis?,"I always knew these guys were getting long in the tooth because they were my rock heros when I was in diapers, sucking on fudgesicles (I'm now 46). I have to think that Billy Gibbons is suffering from arthritis because his timing and accuracy in hitting guitar notes is just awful. It's actually painful to hear these guys play. Frank Beard (drummer) looks like he'd rather be attending a funeral than playing this gig. With all the other reviewers complaining about the poor audio mix on this disc, I can't beleive no one else noticed this lackluster performance of the ""L'il Ol' Band from Texas."""
3,ZZ Top Live in Texas,"This DVD was not as good as i expected, the sound quality is average and the band just seem to be going through the motions. Also the inside pocket in the DVD was ripped both sides where the booklet goes, it sort of looks used?"
1,What is UP With the Sound????,"Just received this TODAY after having 1-day delivery as I COULDN'T WAIT. Now i'm completely disappointed as this DVD has the WORST sound mastering I've ever heard! Didn't anybody check this before send it to manufacturing?The levels go up and down, mostly DOWN during the instrumental breaks. It's a CONCERT for goodness sake!"
3,Good but could have been so much more...,ZZ Top is a great band.The venue looks small enough that a great sounding disc could have been produced. However the sound has TONS of reverb. I don't know if this was in production or post but it was a huge mistake.I also agree w/ others that there are far too many cuts. The editor must have been on speed. I literally could not count to 6 before a cut occurred anywhere I tried.
3,What a shame,"This could have been a great show if the sound wasn't so bad. Sounds like it was recorded on someones dictaphone. After selling my soul to the devil and investing in state of the art AV gear, I was looking forward to this, only to be sadly disappointed. Compare this to the audio on the last two Eagles DVD's, or Eric Clapton's One more car, One more rider, and you will see what I mean."
2,Poor audio quality,"I have a Panasonic 46 inch 1080P, THX certified plasma display. My audio system is McIntosh Labs and Outlaw Audio pre-amp/processor.The video could be a bit better but it is acceptable.The audio is awful. Might be the worst disk I have for sound. The guitar speakers sound like they are in the next room and the drums are set up in a room down the hall.It's nice to see the boys perform, but you might want to think about purchasing this disk if you can't handle poor audio quality.Make sure you change the default audio to 5.1 surround. It uses stereo for the default. It helps a great deal switching to 5.1."
3,zz top,"I was disappointed. Vocals were not great, especially Dusty. Bonus was okay but I wanted more. Still fun to watch."
5,Great Performance,The boys from south texas were in the groove this night in dallas. amazing to see them doing so good!
3,I Hope,"I've been waiting for ZZTop to release another live album for years. Anyone who has ever been to a ZZTop show knows their live versions of songs are much heavier handed then their studio recordings. However, this is the next best things..Excellent DVD, know bring us the cd..."
5,The holy grail at last,"Fans of that little old heavy-metal disco band from Texas will enjoy this long-awaited concert DVD. No surprises here, just a great show!"
5,ZZ Top - Three very talented musicians,"I've only seen ZZ Top live one time but I own eleven of their CD's and now this Blu-ray disk. All the performances here were superb, there's nothing like live music to show you how talented musicians are. And these boys nailed every song and made it look easy. I learned how to play a few of their songs better by being able to see Billy play so clearly. Way to go Blu-ray !!! I even enjoyed the banter between them all telling stories of days gone by while playing cards with a stack o' cash. It looks like they had fun playing, and what a show to have been at. I'll enjoy watching this one many times. Also, not to brag but I play this on my Sony PS3, and watch it on my SAMSUNG HL-T6176S 61"" 16:9 Black DLP 1080p HDTV, as I CRANK it on my Bose Lifestyle 48 home theater system. It's a BLAST !!!"
4,It's bout time for this one.,"I've seen zz Top 2 times live, in the 70's, & listened to their music all my life. This dvd is long overdue for zz Top fans. Don't even think about it twice, buy it. Except go to Walmart, I bought it there for $10. Best deal I ever got at Walmarts. Seriously it is a great concert, these guys prove why U try to keep all your band members in the band forever."
2,lacking audio and vocals,"Lets face it these guys ain't getting any younger, and there vocals are starting to show it. I know there singing isn't what it was some 15 or so years ago and it shows on this dvd. As far as the sound it self goes, just listen to there greatest hits video and theres a big difference in the bass witch is really lacking! I have a pretty nice system that really shows any flaws such as if one dvd has better sound on it than another. Theres also slightly to much echo effect that doesn't help the sound quality either. Overall I would have to say it's not a horrible disc at all, just that the sound could of been better."
5,True Texan Boogie Woogie Band...,"Ok...I am a Houstonian, a Texan, and I can remember ZZ TOP playing at our frat parties in the early seventies. I have been waiting for a ZZ TOP dvd live performance since the FANDANGO tour of '76. This is one great dvd and performance is A+ rated. I hang out at a watering hole in Houston, (which I would never reveal) and Billy Gibbons had been telling us how great this dvd was going to be every time he came in. He was right, their performance was slick and full tilt boogie."
3,zz dv,decent live footage with decent extras but the vocals aren't what they used to be as time marches on brothers
2,Nice performance; horrible editing,ZZ Top gives a very good performance here but the editing is bad beyond belief: you get a barrage of 2-3 second shots that constantly change point of view and you really don't have an opportunity to look at anything. I found this to be totally annoying and it detracts a great deal from an otherwise fine show.
3,SOUND QUALITY,"The sound quality is really poor... I sent my first copy back hoping it was just defective...but...alas the second one arrived today and it's just as bad... Sound drops dramatically in spots, especially during the vocals. ZZTop is my hometown band and I'm going to keep the DVD in spite of the poor sound."
2,Audio Rubbish,"I love ZZ Top , and was looking forward to this Blu Ray disc but the audio is bloody terrible.I re checked the audio set up on both my ps3 and the disc it self but still made no difference.However the picture was pretty good, but thats not the point is it.This should have been a first class, thumping , guitar driven, rockin roll disc, and like another review wrote it sound like somebody used a hand held mike to record the audio, not happy!!!!!"
2,"OH NO, NOT AGAIN","I WAS HOPING THIS DVD WOULD BE THE [...] SHOW OF THE YEAR,BUT ALL WE GOT WAS A MIND NUMBING SPEED EDITOR GIVING US 50 ANGLES A MINUTE.I'M SORRY BUT THIS SUCKS.THE CONCERT LOOKS GOOD BUT THE CAMERA ANGLES MOVE SO QUICKLY THAT THERE IS NO RHYTHM TO THE SHOW. UNLESS YOU LIKE DVD'S IN HIGH SPEED, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I GUESS I'M STUCK WITH MY 2003 CAMDEN BOOTLEG. AT LEAST YOU CAN SEE THE SHOW WITHOUT GETTING A HEADACHE !!!!!!"
3,not bad,"the video quality is superbthe camera work is greatZZ top(especially Billy Gibons) are funny as hellthe only problem I had is that the classic stuff(pre-eliminator) was slowed down and some of the soul seemed to be out of the guitar work as well as the vocals were fairly severly offall material done after eliminator was done perfectlyfor me this is bad cause after eliminator ZZ Top wasn't the same bandpretty commercial and sell out stuff from there onoverall this is watchable and some parts are very goodthe humor that was in the popular videos and songs of the mid 80's is certinly therethe old songs sound like crapJust got paid/Pocket full ofChange,heard it on the X and things like that were embarrassing"
1,BEWARE,"This cd did not have tracks 5,8,18. It is the SAME as the cd that is not an imported. YOU JUST PAY MORE!!!"
1,No MP3's????,"Considering the lack of Top live, save for precious few bonus tracks, how could this NOT BE OFFERED in mp3s?shame on you BILL HAM!!!!!"
1,Crappy Sound Mixing!,I've heard some good and some bad recordings of live performances. This one literally stinks it's so bad. I tried to remain enthusiastic but it never got any better throughout the entire DVD. (In my particular case it certainly can't be blamed on the equipment. I have top of the line Polk Audio speakers & subwoofer set up for 5.1 Surround and driven by a Sony 770w receiver.) It's crappy recording and mixing. Not at all what I'd expect from ZZ Top.
2,it sounds bad or they are?,I have close to 350 concerts on DVD now and have been to many concerts in person over my life but most were great but as for this ZZ Top live DVD eather they are not so good or the sound on the DVD is bad not up to par I have seen better clone bands doing there stuff it was a let down haveing grown up with there music on the radio and on CD and vinyl.
2,Timeless Talent? I think not....Whew!,"There comes a time when its best to hang it up and let your admirers feast on your past performances, back when ZZTop was the best of the genre. 'Live from Texas' is just plain embarrassing, full of incoherent, weak vocals, sloppy guitar rifts, and amateurish antics. Sorry folks, I've reloaded with my 80's and 90's CDs. They will always be the best."
1,TERRIBLE Sound Quality,I thought that the Blu Ray sound quality might be better than the Live CD set. BUT I was VERY WRONG. They should be ASHAMED!!!!!
2,"Good show, poor audio","I was very disappointed with the sound quality of the bluray dvd. At almost twice the price of the sd dvd, I had higher expectations. Call me old fashioned.Flat, uninteresting, no balls, no dynamics, no definition, just a wall-of-sound, no nuances, not exciting, does not grab you, transistor radio quality. One can't help wondering why go through all the HD producing trouble just to put out this very mediocre disc.I feel robbed in daylight."
1,Didn't match,I have a full set of Reed & Barton Hammered Antique silverware. All except salad forks. Was thrilled to find these but when they arrived they didn't match. The handles curved up to down and mine curve down to up. The pattern was nearly the same but just a little off also. So sent them back.
3,"Pretty good, but...","I've read all Crimson TPB's. Brian Augustyn's script is getting better as the story unfolds, and guys who do computer coloring are really great. As for the pencils, Humberto Ramos draws very well (his style resembles that of Greg Capullo), but I find his habit of rendering over-elongated figures with small face, big hands and enormous feet quite irritating. I respect his style, every comic artist distorts or emphasizes some features on his figures, but this is tad too much...If it wasn't for this, I would give this comic four stars."
4,Don't know much about zydeco...,"I only lived in New Orleans for a year, but this album was given to me long before I moved there. As the title states, I don't know much about zydeco, but having visited many a festival, I can say that I like the sound on this album better than nearly anything I've heard. Someone mentioned something about it being blues...perhaps that is why. Some of the zydeco played at festivals these days sounds more like country or oldies (3/4/waltz timing I suppose). I knew this was a gem when for my bachelorette party we went to the Rock n' Bowl and a decent zydeco band was there and they played half of the songs from this CD...I think this is a great album to introduce yourself to zydeco...whether you turn out to be a fan of the genre, you will be sure to be a fan of this one."
5,Quality mic cable,These are quality mic cables. I have used these for many years and will not buy another brand now. Best warranty also.
4,"Great tool, but better if tapes were available","I needed a good book on machine transcription to bring me up to speed -FAST- as I work in a busy law office and we just signed on an associate attorney who prefers to dictate his work rather than have me prepare documents from written notes, the method I'm used to. This book is well-written, concise and very helpful, but was sent from Amazon without the machine transcription tapes that it is written for, and, because of that, is less than a ""five-star"" value. If I can just get the tapes for this to practice with, it will be a valuable addition to the firm's library!"
1,"The remixes are the same, long and boring","The In House Mix and the Digital Club Mix of these songs are pretty much the same. I sat down and listened repeatedly to them and could only find maybe a 5 second part of the bass line that was different at about 3.20 (I needed to sit and find the difference for myself to see if they could justify these 2 aganonising mixes on the one cd).Todd Terry has done this on a few jamiroquai singles where he does one remix and put different names to them for a tiny change that is inconsequential to the song overall. The only good change is that he energised a song that lacked it in the first place, as when you listen to it, a song about being alright and happy should be a bit bouncier.This cd is purely for the completist, unless you like an 18 minute long repetitive drum loop!"
3,Not as close to Christmas Tree smell,Not as close to true Christmas tree smell as I'd hoped. Too much like a pine cleaning product. a little disappointed. And shipping was so high for what I'd spent on the product.
3,"Smells nice, but doesn't last","The smell is great, same as it would smell from a real pine tree, but it doesn't last :-( You have to spray it every 30 min or so. That would make it run out pretty fast and the bottle is not cheap. So I am going to continue using it, but I am not convinced I would buy it again (I'll keep searching)"
1,Okay for model history,Okay for general information. Covers too many years for details about any one model or year.
4,Very Well Detailed and Organized,"This book is very well organized and format makes it easy to read and understand. Most of the historical overview books, I have read are very boring and have only words that take up space. This book does not do that. It gives an excellent overview of Japan from the Jomon period to it opening up the country for visiters in certain areas. The art is well described. The terminology used in this book is very simple for anyone who is not familar with art and its terminology."
4,Halcyon Days CD,"This is an effective meditation aid, and may drift one into sleep. First heard it on TV--New Age Music. Usually some sections of a CD are better than others, as is the case with Halcyon Days; yet, overall provides a calming effect on the listener."
2,It's okay,"I really love digeridoo music, so I thought this would be a great addition to my collection. However, I find most of the songs to sound too similiar for me to distinguish one from the other. The only track on this album that I really like is #2. It seems awfully dark, almost scary and ritualistic sounding. The rhythm is unusual (in 5/4) so it intrigues me. Other than that, I fouind this purchase to be disappointing."
5,Wonderful Heartwarmers,"Dear HW4u: I would not feel ""whole"" with out starting my day with Heartwarmers. I bought my Heartwarmers book Saturday and finished it Sunday night. It is one of the BEST books of its kind ever published! My daughter is already starting it and requesting copies for her friends. I realize this was no small undertaking in getting it ready for publishing. Thank You, Thank You and Thank You again for all the effort. I love the smaller size also. Fits right into a purse or pocket. I am an avid reader; never without a book; so can relate to reading in grocery lines, stopped up traffic, etc. Keep up the great work -- Mary Acheson <mjacheson@hotmail.com>"
5,Awesome,"I received this book the day after it's release. I can't even begin to tell you how many tears I have shed reading this book. The tears being good ones. It is such a wondeful feeling to know that are still people out there that are so kind, and wonderful. I am sure that some of them do not even realize the impact that they have in people's lives with the words that they write. I have purchased several more copies of this book, and all of my co workers have each brought a book. If you do not subscribe to heartwarmers, I urge you to, it is guarenteed to change your life forever. In my eyes there are not enough stars to rate this wonderful book. Thank you to all the writers for all the wonderful work that you do.Sincerely, Susie Cardoso"
5,Wonderful book,"What can I say, it was everything you'd want and more from an Ingres book. Highly recommended."
4,Favorite Painter!,"Always my favorite painter, I was lucky enough to see an exposition of his work at the National Art Gallery in London in 1999 and his more famous works on constant display the Louvre in 2000. While his historical and allegorical paintings are impressive, his talent with portraiture is unmatched. I am particularly struck by the detailed imagery. It feels like you are looking at a photography, the realism is so intense. Yet as the book demonstrates, numerous studies were done before each painting, trying to determine how best to capture the subject.The book is a large format, with numerous full color, full plate images. Personally, I did not find the accompanying essays particularly interesting but thought that the notes on each specific work more compelling. The choices of artwork included in the book is primarily restricted to portraits, but not only paintings but paper drawings and minatures also."
3,"caution, drawing students...","first off: i just received this book today and i've only skimmed through it as yet. now, my complaint is that i'm a student of portraiture and i bought this book for the portrait drawings which i was assuming would be reprinted in their actual size (most of the 300+ original drawings are no larger than 10""x 12"") so i could see the detail and make some copies. sadly, however, nearly all the portrait drawings in this book have been shrunken down to next to worthless for my purpose. i suppose all the words that take up so much space in the book are important, but more important than the actual works themselves?? disappointing. what really rankles is that even shrunken down the portraits still sing, only now they're just too small to make out how. ARRGHH!! :Pnice book tho. hence the three stars..."
4,Ladybird Read it Yourself 4-5 year,This is a collection of six Ladybird books. Ladybird read it yourself books are an old English series of small books(about 4 x 6 inches; about forty pages) of fairy tales for the beginning reader. The problem with this series is that it merges what was traditionally level 1 and level two books (half the books are at each level) so some books are for the very beginning reader(two sentence on a page and lots of repetition) and others are for the end of first grader or early second grader. (This is why I assigned four and not five stars). Still it is wonderful having some of these books available in the U.S. at a very reasonable price. Makes a great gift for a child just starting school. This set was bought as a gift for a classroom teacher for use in her classroom. The copies of these books that I had bought her twenty years ago were just worn out!
2,not sturdy,Purchased this recently and it only weighs about three pounds. It is made of very thin material. We hung it up and decided it would not last. It is not worth the money. Nice company to deal with though.
5,Amazing Hammock,I think this is probably one of my favorite hammocks that I own. It is sturdy especially the ropes which hang the hammock up. You can tell it is extremely well made. It came with a bag for carrying it in which is perfect because I like to bring it to the beach with me. I found myself even hanging it in my room and I would just do my homework in it or study. I find it to be extremely comfortable and would recommend it !I would like to note that:When I received the product there were a few loose strands of fabric I had to trim off.It also did not come with anything to help hang it so I had to buy the stuff on my own.
2,Disappointed,"Even knowing that I would need to lie in this hammock differently from the traditional hammocks that I am used to, I have found this hammock uncomfortable. We haven't used it very much at all in the last couple of months, and when we have, it has been more like a couch than a bed. I'll buy a traditional hammock nex time."
5,aaaahhhhhh,"Well made and more than big enough for one person (I am a woman 5'8"" and 130#)- maybe OK for two. Extremely comfortable. Get some pillows and enjoy!"
3,"good, but not great","while this hammock is more than adequate, i feel it didn't quite live up to the other glowing reviews it received. the hammock's manufacturer encourages you to go ""brazilian style"", meaning to lie diagonally across the fabric, instead of lying lengthwise and being swallowed by the cocoon of fabric. But instead of feeling incredibly relaxed, ala being on a beach in Brazil, I end up with a slight neck cramp from trying to keep my body from slipping down to a ""normal"" hammock position.Cute and colorful, it's definitely a fine hammock, but I feel there are probably better ones out there.I also think that hammocks, like shoes, are things that you can't purchase online. You must sit, lie and test to make sure it's the right ""fit"" for you."
5,Best value for the money!,"I am totally satisfied with the purchase, comfort, breathability, style, and quality of this stable cotton hammock. It can be used to elevate the legs almost like traction therapy for people with back injuries! Truly relaxing!"
1,Tip melted before I even started soldering.,"I remove my old tip and install the new one. I then proceed to plug the gun in and wait for it to heat up so I can begin. As I am attending to other things, the piece of garbage starts smoking and shriveling up as if it were made of solder. Don't waste your money on this, I know I did."
3,Minnetonka Women's Hardsole Pile-Lined Slipper,"These are nice slippers, I like them, but they're not what I was expecting. The size runs a bit short and narrow--not a lot, but not true to size. The thickness of the shoe liner between the pile and the rubber sole is a little thin. Sometimes I actually feel a ridge of the waffle shape inside the rubber sole poking into the bottom of my foot through the lining of the moccasin. The synthetic pile makes my feet sweat and then they feel cold. Guess I should have bought the moccasins that are true, breathable sheepskin. The materials seem to be of good quality, and I like the leather ties. The ties are actually threaded through the collar of the shoe so that you can tighten or loosen the fit. Yes, I will buy again, but I will go with the soft-sole, sheepskin moccasin one size larger."
5,An old favorite,"I bought these shoes as a gift for my granddaughter after explaining to her that when I grew up Minnetonka's were the brand of this style to have. They are very well made, they wear long, and while they cost a bit more than cheap versions they are well worth it. This seller shipped out quickly and I had no problems with this purchase. I would buy from again."
2,Order larger,"Order came quickly but the sizing was way off -- although they looked nice. If you order, go for Wide and select at least one size bigger."
3,They're okay,"They hurt the heels of my feet really badly, but I'm really hoping that they will break in at some point because they are really soft. But after wearing them the first day, I had really bad blisters on the back of my heel. I was also hoping that the tops would come closer up to my ankle, but they leave a lot of my foot open to the cold and look stupid with socks."
1,what.....the hell.... is this??/,"Too narrow. Unless you foot is as thin as a pencil this shoe is fantastically bad.It smells bad, the stitching is bad, the stitches is hard which means its gonna pop on you very soon.I was not expecting this shoe to look like my grandmothers' church shoes either. Who wants this? I SWEAR this shoe is only 3inches across.pffft you're dissin my native people by calling this a moccasin.i dont want to give this any stars."
3,Feel great but...,"The tops of these shoes are very long and look ""manly"" I ordered an 8 even though I am a 71/2 (since they don't have a 71/2) and they were too large. So if you are going to order them, remember the top of the shoe is very long and order them small. I wonder if they are actually mens not womens?"
2,The medium runs very narrow,"I had the identical slipper in the same size some years ago and it fit fine. This one was much too narrow. If you want a medium, order a wide."
4,Great Slippers!,I bought these as a Christmas present for my little sister and she loves them! They are so soft and comfy!
2,Soft but lacking in proper fit,Very narrow in the toe and the heel slips. Couldn't order the next size down to get less slippage in the heel because the toe was so pointed. Sent them back.
4,"OK, size not quite right...",Thought I had ordered these in 9 M - They were ordered as a gift and they fit her OK after all... She really likes them.
4,My Winter Indoor Shoes,I ordered these mocassins because they were the color I wanted. Delivery was speedy and they were exactly what I wanted for the winter. They seem sturdy and are very comfortable. I think they will last a long time. The suede cord doesn't stay tied but I think that always happens with these cords.I'd feel comfortable ordering from them again. You should too!!
2,moccasin,I was very pleased with my first pair size 7 N so I ordered another.Unfortunately the second pair was at least a half size larger. Ididn't realize it until the fleece flattened out so I couldn't returnthem. They went to GoodWill. I conclude that quality control isinadequate.
3,Review of Cd The Firm,I ordered this Cd because the music in the movie was fabulous. But.... the CD skips and that is disappointing
3,Not So Firm,Once again Mister Grusin demonstrates his inability to score a film. His music is not bad but he has no inkling about the rigors that go into scoring a film. I suppose he has been around long enough and he did score THE GRADUATE but he still has not shown any real depth when it comes to getting inside the characters we see on the screen. His compositions lack depth and that important spark of emotion. Sorry.
1,Really bad,"I used it only 3 weeks. Later, a lot of problems began. At the present: I prefered to buy other one. Don't waste your money"
3,Don't be mislead by the name,"This product ships with a NVIDIA GeForce *6200* AGP 8X Graphics Card, not a 6600 card."
4,Klezmer Soul,I just saw Kol Simcha in concert 2 weeks ago in Scottsdale and wanted to get some of their music to listen to at home. I really enjoyed this title but it lacks the jazz components that I found so unique from their live performance. The music on this album is very soothing to listen to and is very different from traditional Klezmer music. I recommend this album very much.
5,Weller Replacement Soldering Iron Tips,Weller replacement tips work the best for this kind of application. Would not buy any others again they don't last as long. Great Price here at Amazon.
5,So Helpful,This is a very informative detailed guidebook. We bought it for my daughter in preparation for doing a study abroad program. By reading it I have learned a lot about the country's history and geography as well as the usual tips on where to stay and tourist sights to see.
3,Good but depnds,Alright this new edition is a good book. Lots of color pictures and good descriptions. There are some issues though. I live in Texas and either we don't have as many as other areas or they didn't really cover what we do have but there is hardly any of my local flora in that book. However it will still be in my day pack anywhere I go and as far as I have found this is better than most and as good as any.
4,"Food, food, all around me!","Book is good, had it for a few weeks now. It has a ton of plants even some I have never seen in my area. It is more concentrated on plants in the East/Atlantic area. Some of the pictures are a little small, and a few are black and white. but before reading this book I know that I could eat dandy lions but that was about it. Now, with even only a few weeks of looking through this book Im pretty sure I could survive a few days off of it. At least till I could trap or hunt down some prey. Over all I would suggest getting this book for anyone looking to get a bit of survival skills. It will tell you what plants to eat, what to harvest off of them and then how to prepare them. Also poisonous look alikes."
3,An incredibly average wild edibles plant book.,"Overall rating: 3 starsPlant identification: 3 starsPlant uses: 3 starsPicture type(s): color photographsWho will find it useful: novice foragers though more experienced forager might find a nugget or two of new information.Notes: This is a very average book. The pictures are okay, the directions for preparing the plants are okay. It's main benefit is the large number of plants it contains. I also like the maps of where these plants are found, but these maps are somewhat inaccurate. This book is worth getting cheaply from a used book seller but I wouldn't buy a new copy."
2,"North America includes Texas and New Mexico, but this book hardly does!","Disappointed. Separated by ""spring"" and ""summer"" offerings, I found little in either section that actually grows in my part of the country. Texas, New Mexico and surrounding areas are barely represented. If I had to rely on this book solely for food or survival, I'd starve. Lots of pretty pictures though so I'd have something to occupy my mind while I wasted away."
5,Edible Wild Plants: A North American Field Guide (1990 edition),"I have read, and thoroughly studied, several books of this type and found ""Edible Wild Plants: A North American Field Guide"" a gem and to be the most immediately useful. Having information arranged by season, mapped to general location, many color photos, thorough data and explanations, plus quick margin keys for use/caution/danger are handy."
3,Only Fair for Identification,"Identification of edible species is what I want, with emphasis on the first word. From my experience in identifying tree species and other plant ID handbooks, I'd call this one mediocre. The photos are often close-ups with no indication of scale, so size is unknown. Details are not included. Root structure and overall plant structure are seldom shown. ID often depends on flowers, present only for a few weeks of the year. Variation among species is so widespread that I'd recommend at least two good books, with better illustrations than those found here. Drawings, though not ""natural"", often provide better clues to identity by showing roots, structure, etc."
3,Should be called Edible Wild Plants of the North East,Pretty good book. Informative - but the vast majority of the plants are in the North East - very few west coast plants. Would recommended something different if you live west of the rockies.
2,Not for west coast people,I live and travel around the western US and found very few of the editable plants listed to be available in this area. The book otherwise looks pretty good and is very detailed.
1,Edible Wild Plants (North American Field Guide),"Probably the best and most comprehensive guide book ever written on this subject. Colored pictures of the most widely available plants is useful for accurate identification. Identification of the eco-system in which each plant is found; the best time for harvesting; and the various parts of the plant that can be used and how to use it effectively not to mention poisonous look-alikes, is invaluable to the trekker. A key is aid in the variety of ways the plant can be consumed, ie raw, boiled, fried, etc. rounds off the extensive valuable information contained in this timeless treasure trove."
3,Ups and Downs,"This book is a good field guide to edible plants in North America, but it has some black and white pictures.It tells you how to prepare the plants, but nothing on there medicinal properties. Wich is the reason I bought it so I guess Im out of luck on that one."
3,not much for texas,"little disappointed, i was mostly interested in native Texas plants. This is for all north america. so flipping back and forth to find the regions, which are not listed on the page with plants, is a pain. but the info and photos are good."
5,WONDERFUL STORY,WHAT A GREAT STORY--MY KIDS LOVED IT. I HAD A NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR JUST LIKE THE ONE IN THIS STORY. LOTS OF LAUGHS AND A GREAT ENDING
5,No One Does It Better,"I have been an avid fan of Flamenco music and dance for a decade. Gino D'Auri's piece titled ""Flamenco Mystico"" is the best I have yet to hear. Many Flamenco pieces are loud and disjointed,and often are enjoyed only in live performance with a dancer. However, this CD is the best of passionate Flamenco you will find on the market. Listen to it, enjoy it, anywhere, anytime. Two pieces really stand out... ""Quelo de Triana (Soleares)"" and Recuerdos de la Alhambra. Too bad he is a sporadic recorder."
5,Terrific Series!,"The Little Einsteins is the best new cartoon series for children. My 3-year old has learn so much about counting and musical instruments. I have a 6 year-old that stops whenever a new one comes on, while the younger one can watch it over and over and over!"
5,Tchaikovsky!,"We bought this DVD for our two year old so she could become familiar with Christmas. We were listening to a song from the Nutcracker, and my daughter said, ""Tchaikovsky"". She is TWO! Anyway, she also knows Beethoven from this. Anyway, it is great!"
5,Little Einsteins: The Life Saver,"Whenever I need mommy time, this is it! It keeps my son captivated and he actually learns from this. His vocabulary has expanded. He knows some pretty big words for a 4 year old. My son has been watching Little Einsteins since he was 6 months old. I don't care for it but it does wonders. A good buy and worth every penny! Satisfied mom."
4,a gripping account of mountain climbing,If you are even vaguely interested in what posseses someone to climb the highest most dangerous mountain peaks in the world and various climbing team interactions and mentalities this is the book for you!
3,Not the best climber in the world but....,I found the book to be very fun to read. Although Jim didn't make it to the top of every climb he atempted he sure had a thrilling time trying to get there. I thought he wrote well of his experiences and lifes story. A good read for those who like real life adventures. I think his wife deserves a medal! I cant believe she stuck with him all those years.
4,Facing our Annapurna's,"As much an account of our human frailties as it is of our bravados, this is a great armchair read for those interested in the great outdoors and some of its top class adventurers of the last half century. Manageable in a single sitting, Wickwire & Bullitt recount one man's story of a 30+ yrs devotion to (part-time?) mountain climbing career which includes meetings with the World's major ranges and their recent climbers. This volume is true story-telling of high altitude adventures with a stunning cast, told in a lucid, accessible fashion with care and passion. Novel in the sense that the action is told biographically without too much technical detail, this book deals with exposure to the death of those dear in both a moving and inspiring way. A must read for budding and seasoned serial hikes/climbers, as much as for those wishing to share the passion without the risk of exposure to their own series of Annapurnas."
2,Amatuerish writing by an egomaniac with little to say.,"I was initially shocked at the large point font. Later I realized that this was necessitated by the author's lack of writing or observational skills.The story starts strongly, but then wimpers out. He concentrates on the soap opera aspects of the climbing team while ignoring the human versus mountain drama.An annoying, frustrating little book after reading ""Into Thin Air"", ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Endurance"".Look at the cover, then don't bother further with this one."
2,Not worth the trouble,"There are so many great mountaineering books out there, this one just isn't worth the time. If you want a book on this subject by a really great author, consider Joe Simpson's ""This Game of Ghosts""."
1,Save your money...,"Disappointing. An egotistic account of Wickwire's climbing career that is poorly titled and thinly written. While it is hard to argue that Wickwire is a top notch alpinist, this fact doesn't result in quality writing or insight. I became quickly annoyed at the condescending tone at other climbers and the constant abandonment of family. Though leaving family and friends for long periods of time on expeditions is hardly uncommon, Wickwire made it seem to easy. No lengthy mention is made of any hardship on his family - were they ""Addicted to Stress""? The writing concerning his climbs wasn't bad, but better mountaineering stories can be found elsewhere - look for Greg Child, Krakauer, Art Davidson. It is funny that Lou Whitaker figures so prominently in many of the climbs, this book reminded me of his ""I am great"" memoir of a few years ago."
2,"Exciting, but not because of the author","This book allows the reader to go to different and exciting regions of the world, and tells of adventures that most people will never get to experience. Unfortunately, it was written by an ego-driven man who disrespects others, including his wife and children.I have never experienced a sexist man be so open about his beliefs, but so oblivious to how wrong and horrible of a person he is. The author is definitely someone I never wish to meet, and I am embarrassed that he represented our country when he was one of the first two Americans to reach the summit of K2.I wish I had read a review before purchasing this book, but at least I got it on sale. Save your money and time, and purchase a different book. If you haven't read Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer; buy his book instead."
5,Compelling reading,"I'm not a mountain climber. I'm the person who always said 'why would that person put his/her life at risk, when there's a family involved?' I'm having to change my thinking. As I read the reviews of people who are feeling so terribly sorry for his wife, I have to agree with the person who said, 'if he were a different kind of man, she probably wouldn't have been interested in him.' They are a strong team. Whether that was good for the children or not--who can say--but they were both responsible for the children, not just Jim, so both can be praised or damned equally. I can't imagine that 'his wife' thinks of herself as a poor thing. She sounds like a very capable person who is getting along very well, thank you very much. Anyway, I found the book fascinating in a way I didn't expect and it has sent me scouring the bookstores for more of the same."
4,Interesting book but what a narcissist!,"I don't know what I found so compelling about this book - the wonderful descriptions of the dangers of climbing or the awful egocentricity of the man in which he proffers guilt-laden compliments about his wife without really coming across as knowing her, the rationalizations from which come the ""addicted"" part of the title, but clearly here was man driven by macho competition much to the detriment of his own emotional development. If this book serves as an apology to his wife and children, it lacks the insight - but the physical descriptions of climbing are breath-taking."
4,Educational and fascinating!,"What an amazing life Jim Wickwire has led. Although I was frustrated at times, like other reviewers, of Jim's willingness to risk everything important in his life for the thrill of reaching the summit, I really enjoyed this book. I learned an amazing amount about mountain climbing in a way that didn't bore me or become bogged down with details. It was fascinating. The one thing I never did learn was why a man would continue to climb mountain after mountain even after seeing friend after friend die before his eyes."
3,How depressing!,"Jim Wickwire is certainly one of the top climbers of recent years, but he doesn't seem to have had much fun doing it! This book dwells at great length on one disaster and failure after another (on and off the mountains), while skipping over many of Wickwire's successful climbs, often with a comment over what a letdown it was after reaching the summit. And the part of the book about his greatest triumph (the K2 ascent) ends up being mostly about bickering among the team members! My suspicion (just a guess) is that the negative slant may be largely the fault of his co-author. Incidentally, peeking ahead while reading, I saw the picture of Wickwire's wife near the end, and was fully expecting the last chapter to be about her filing for divorce! To my surprise, she hasn't (she's willing to put up with more than I would have, I guess), but I wish Jim more enjoyment from his retirement from climbing than he had from his climbing."
2,"great climber, lousy writer, terrible person","Jim Wickwire is an outstanding mountaineer and probably a good lawyer. He should have been satisfied by that. Instead, he penned a poorly written, fairly dull and thoroughly unsatisfying account. His arrogant, callous, and selfish personality shines throughout this book. My sympathies to his wife and family. Worse, his expressions of regret and concern about his family seem mechanical and self-serving. I'm always struck, when reading these types of books, that the author tosses in a suggestion that it was hard on the wife or kids (in this case his daughter Anne) but oh, hey, it all worked out., she got over it. etc. I would have thought more of him if he had been at least honest. All in all, I suggest you don't bother with this book unless you've read almost everything else on climbing."
4,good read,"although sad at times, Jim Wickwire gives a good account of all his adventures spanning a long climbing career. I especially like the little song about his first expedition to K2 (somewhere around pg. 100) it was semi-inspiring to me (it made me want to take another crack at Rainier) it is a good book for the money. I also recommend Maurice Herzog's book about the first ascent of Annapurna."
2,This book is very troubling and cold!,"Although this book was supposed to be about climbing it contained no more about climbing than what a climbing magazine would put in it's main article. Mostly Wickwire rambles on about his narrow escapes and doles out judgement from his high loft about other's abilities and affairs. When he himself falls through the same pitfalls of human emotions he tries to justify it through his diary. I was sadly dissapointed with his attitude towards his family and climbing.Dear Mr. Wickwire: If you so craved challenge and the thrills of life you need not scale peaks to do so. You would just have to turn your attention to your loving wife and your 5 children who so deperately wanted your love and attention. I understand the call of climbing but I believe you wanted more than a challenge, you wanted freedom. At least in the end you figured what is truly important."
2,memoirs of a rich guy who liked to climb,"read ""the undertaking - life studies of the dismal trade"" by tom lynch if you want affirmation of life in the face of death."
1,"""A very self centered man abandons family for the mountains""","A brutal documentation of a selfish, self-centered man who regularly abandons his family, and loses too many friends on the mountain(is it a coincidence?). None of the poetry evoked by Jon Krakauer. What has he learned or what has he really to share with the rest of us? I bought this because Amazon.com highlighted it. I will wait for reviews next time."

5,Hajime no Ippo in 3 different languages. nuff said.,Fighting Spirit is one of the best anime out there. It is a must for any fan of boxing or even anime in general.
5,Lovely CD!,"This is a lovely cd well-worth the couple of pounds it cost me to buy it. So many ""celtic"" cd's are around today, and many of them lack, shall I say...the real flavor of Ireland. However, this cd captures it. I love it!"
5,A must-have cd for fans of celtic music,"This cd has a nice blend of various kinds of celtic music that is both soothing to listen to, but also makes you feel as if you are flying when you hear it. The beautiful rhythms and melodies of the artists makes you dream of far-away places that you might never have seen or imagined but for the sound of the music of magical places that reaches you through this collection."
1,Grossly inferior,"Poor construction, poor sound quality and lack of essential features, such as visual indication of waiting voice mail, make this product one of the worst possible choices."
1,A Horrible Phone,I bought this phone because I needed a cordless 2 line phone. The phone get allots of static and interfernce. The speakerphone has poor sound quality. The rest of the functions though present do not work well i caller id memory .
1,The WORST Phone EVER,"Amazon is the best, and offers the best deals anywhere. However this phone is the WORST!I never realized how bad it could be until my daughter swallowed some day glow liquid from one of the silly party bracelets. In calling our doctor, local ER and Poison Control Center, I was so frustrated that I couldn't hear anything they said (the static is so bad). To complicate matters, the dialing is so slow that it added to the stress. Thank G-d for cell phones!!!Do not buy this phone, because you will never know in an emergency if it will perform."
1,Terrible,"Returning. As the last reviewer said there is a clicking or popping sound every second or two. I think that this is a 2.4Ghz analog phone, not digital. Could be interference from the wireless network. Changing channels doesn't help much. Any any rate, aside from the popping, the sound is muffled. Our AT&T sounds much clearer. My advice- choose something else."
1,This is a dog,"I own two of these dogs, thanks to BellSouth/ATT. I had a set of Siemens 2-line cordless, but a power surge killed them and BellSouth/ATT replaced them with these Uniden models under warranty. The best thing about the EXI3226 is the shipping box. Everything else is junk. The range is limited to one room, so the cordless aspect is extremely limited. The best thing I can say is that the battery life is good. Other than the battery life, this phone is a dog. If this is typical of Uniden's products, I would not expect them to be around much longer."
3,"Good, but not Collins good","As a huge fan of the Sonja Blue series, and Collins as a writer, I must say that I was very dissapointed with this book. While it is ok, it does not live up to her previously fantastic style. It lacks that something that only Nancy A. Collins can give it. It reads alright, but at times feels like she was rushed. If you like Sonja Blue get it, but don't look for something of Paint it Black, Sunglasses after Dark, A Dozen Black Roses, or even Angels on Fire's calibur."
5,I love this book,"I love this book, I randomly read it becasue it is my favorite novel. It is very sweet and it shows that love can happen when you least expect it."
2,Mmm...Remember what mama said about judging a book....,"by it's cover? Well listen to her, because this book was mediocre at best. Maybe somebody else will enjoy hearing about a couple's marriage of convenience, but I personally wasn't amused by this mockery of the holy institution. True, romance books aren't suppose to be written like the bible, but any time you have two people getting married just to get a piece of land from their grandmother, I just don't think that's right.And if the heroine, Monique had such a succesful salon before, I don't understand why she didn't have enough money set aside to pay for her own bills, instead of being dependent on a man!All in all, I felt like Monique played the predictable 'helpless female' while Nick Parker played the easily understandable 'strong, take control man'. If you want something predictable, then read this book, otherwise, keep searching."
2,So so,Not very good. I would not recommend this to buy. Very generic and some does not seem like space music. Don't waste your money.
4,Leave the world behind,"This music is guaranteed to tune out the world, and take you to another place entirely. Good for meditation or trance work. A combination of electronic music, ""nature"" sounds, and a bit of science fiction-like space age audio."
1,Piece of S**t,"Had the drive for about 8 months, using it infrequently as a second CD-RW drive to burn a disk copy directly. While using it to install a new registered copy of MS-Windows XP Professional a heard a loud ""pop' about 25 minutes into the process. The damn drive had destroyed the CD, shattering it into thousands of small bits. Needless to say, The disk was worth a lot more than this cheap, crappy drive."
1,horrible drive,"could someone please explain to me why in the hell my drive opens and closes none stop ever since i install this horrible drive. as soon as i installed it, it started this. it finally stopped opening and closing but when it stops the door stays open. what in the world is going on with this P.O.S. product. no contact info to be found anywhere. the product does not work because the door is wide open and if you try and shut it, it starts opening and closing again. could someone tell me what is going on. thank you, michael"
1,Installation Instructions,"I bought this product new, in the box. The installation instructions are a one page ""quick"" installation. The first thing I am told to do... Set a switch that does not exist on the product. So, I went to step 2. Same thing, the product does not have what this step is talking about.Excuse me, but I need to have instructions on how to install the product. I have purchased this product, and it is now sitting in the box it came in. I can't use it, because I can't install it."
4,great series-action sequences clever & comedic,"I watched the whole series, not just this box set. I am including this as there is not much commentary in north america about this series.This was a pretty good series. Only drawback is that animation is quite mediocre ie if used to ghost in the shell/mamoru oshi stuff, then it looks very cheap. Cheap in that there is not much contrast in color scheme & palette is bluish.HOwever, if you liked MIDNIGHT RUN w/ De Niro which action sequences were very clever, not predictable & situations were funny. THen YOu would love this series.Not as pretentious as NOIR. Very Fun.Please note that amazon review that this show is very fan service is wrong. Only fan service really in opening credit & beginning episodes. NOT like Aika or Najica level."
2,Would have been nice but,The series was taken down before I finished watching. But there was too much shonen fan service for my taste.
3,"Great features, poor sound quality","The Uniden DCT-5285 has great features:caller id,answering machine,speaker-phone on handset & base,speed dial,distinctive ring tones which vary based on who is calling,expandable to 4 handsets.The problem is the sound quality. If I pick up the phone, get a dial tone, then press the 1 key, I hear noticeable static. When placing a call with the phone, there is an echo when I speak. When I'm at work and receive a call made from the Uniden phone, the echo is also present, and the person speaking on the Uniden phone sometimes sounds muffled, as if the phone is in a paper bag.Features can only take a phone so far. In the end, sound quality is what makes or breaks a phone. I'd gladly have given up some features to get better sound quality. I returned the phone."
2,noisy,"I am returning this phone because it failed my simple test: dial 1 and listen for a few seconds and see if you hear static noise. Microwave was off and so was the wireless router.Another test: call work and leave a message for yourself, call work and hear message and see if you like it. When I used the speaker phone on the base unit, it sounded awful. Using the handset, the sound quality was OKFailed."
4,better than the rest,"After returning an(different brand) that didn't have the right features and an SBC-branded phone that had absolutely horrible sound quality, I bought this one and am happy. It has a little static, but I think that may be very difficult to avoid in a 2.4 GHz phone. I have an additional handset and the range is good. I've got the base unit in my office (next to my computer, router, fax, printer, monitor -- so maybe a little static is to be expected) and the extra handset out in the garage. The speakerphone is good quality--easy to have a clear 2-way conversation. the placement of the mic (on the underside of the unit) makes this possible (avoids feedback) but makes your voice sound a little far away to the person on the other end."
5,Is it really fiction?,"If you ever suspected that The Hundredth Monkeystory could apply to human beings, or that we arehere on earth to learn valuable lessons, you willwant to read this book. If you worry about any ofthe negative things happening to people or tomother earth today, you will want to read this book.If you believe in love and friendship this book willreinforce these values in unique ways. If you haveever wondered, as small children often do, about""where was I before I was born?"", Hunt will giveyou food for thought. This is a keeper to share,discuss and read again and again"
4,Interesting Book,Purchased as a gift for Christmas and proved to be interesting and a bit of a conversation piece.
2,A Feeble Compromise,"When this album came out 32 years ago I was told not to waste my time with this one. I understood why.This was a ""feeble compromise"" GCS attempt to get on the disco bandwagon was just that.If the objective of this album was piss off their fans then Star Walk was a huge success.Even the songs that showed GCS doing what they do were just not there.repetitive overlong tracks just slowed this one down & I understand why this was there last record before larry went solo.I definiely would pass on this one."
2,STOP THE PRESSES! Get some Disco in that FUNK!,"Disco fever had over taken the Funk at this point, hence the change in style, flavor and feel of Larry & the shrunk down Central Station. ""You're a Foxy Lady"" gave a last gasp funk feel, but ""Scream"" is probably the top funk tune in this mere 6 track outing. Starwalk? An attempt to discofy the funk. Some cool bass work on Sneaky Freak.SCREAM, Foxy Lady and Entertainer are the best gems here, but this was going to be the last hurrah for L.G. until he shocked the powers that be when he showed he could Ballad his way to ringing the cash register."
2,very disappointing,"AF was extremely slow, even in good light. I tested it against another Sigma lens, non-HSM, with similar minimum aperture. The motor sounded underpowered, even with a freshly charged battery in the D70s.Shots were sharp and nicely contrasty, when I used manual focus."
1,wrong olive oil,I ordered a particular type of olive oil which was advertised 2 for $40.00. I ended up with 2 bottles of something I didn't order. Option: repack it and go back to ups or keep it. So I kept it and would not order again from this out fit.
3,Soulero - good but not great,"I bought this cd after listening to Kenny Burrell and John Coltrane (which is phenomenal). It has its moments, but is not a great cd. Burrell's playing is ok, but with the horns in the rhythm section, it;s just hard for me to listen. There are many great Burrell albums out there; this isn't one of them"
2,Not very good,"I bought this primarily for the sharpening jig. It is not very made and required a good bit of modification to even perform adequately. Handles are OK, but gravers need improvement also.They could be modified to fill in some gaps in an existing set, but don't count on this set being your primary tools."
4,Love this aluminum mount,"Bought two of these aluminum ball mounts together with SS balls. Love the light weight, higher capacity than most steel and appearance. Note though that the shank portion with pin hole might be shorter that what you are used to, so make sure pin is through hole, not air."
3,"Interesting, but drawn out...","Historical fiction -- especially well researched historical fiction, as is the case here -- is normally a wonderful thing as far as I'm concerned. And I will say that Elizabeth Crook did a fantastic job of creating a realistic, event-tethered story with plausible characters. The story ties together some significant events and conventions of the late 1800s and early 1900s, bringing to light both the good and bad of that time period.However, I can't say I really enjoyed it. At may points the book felt tedious to me, either because I found the modern-day relationships somewhat melodramatic and unnecessarily complicated or frustrating, or because Hannah's journal entries started to feel repetitive and depressing. There were several places in which I got tired of trying to slog my way through the text and skimmed for a few paragraphs, and felt that when I picked up reading again later that I hadn't really missed anything."
2,I must have read a different book,"I guess one reviewer's ""haunting beautiful"" is another's tedious and mundane. (Read Markus Zusak's The Book Thief, then try to tell me Crook's prose is ""hauntingly beautiful."") Meg is unlikable, Bassie is unbelievable, the Journals are dull, the ""love interest"" is married with kids. The ""secrets"" are both obvious and contrived. There's some interesting info about the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre, and accurate historical detail. Maybe I expected too much based on the reviews. Then again, Harriet Klausner only gave it 4 stars, which should be warning enough for anyone."
2,A real labor of .... work,"I'll confess right off --> I slogged through til about page 250, then I couldn't stand the drudgery any longer, and skipped ahead to the final two chapters. Other than learning that the disagreeable Bassie had thankfully died, there seemed to be no great illumination. Meg appeared to continue on her dreary path.I stuck through as long as I did because of my interest in the Las Vegas, NM, locale.Truthfully, I think I'm giving this two stars instead of one out of respect for the friend who lent the book to me.What did I find so objectionable? For one, the characters were either unlikable or uninteresting. Two, the much-celebrated journals of Hannah were like barely-hidden little history lessons. Dry; too detailed. Third, it felt like ironing."
4,the first 100 pages almost lost me,"I find the reviews for this novel fascinating. There is very little comment on what was for me the Grabber. I had not heard of the 1857 Massacre. My history teachers taught about Indian massacres but not Mormans murduring pioneers- white folks killing white folks. The account grabbed my attention enough that I dug around. Was this made up? No. Ms. Crook seems to have done her homework well. Otherwise, the novel was written unevenly. The diaries could have been a book by themselves. Thank you, Ms. Crook, for illuminating me further on the infiltration of a religious cult. You've given me much to ponder, especially since the claws are still with us in this modern age."
5,Well writtten contribution to a pervasive problem,"The author has given a lot of thought to this book - only 45 pages - very clear, concise, and effective. It is not just a passage or a brief example of an experience of domestic abuse, but the whole story. The psychology of the dynamics are woven into the story. I realize more from this reading how the problem of domestic abuse could happen to any woman, especially since the character, Leia, was a normal young woman, with many positives within herself, before she was in the abusive situation."
1,Wrong dimension,"They are supposed to be 10.5 x 9.6 x 1.3 inches but when I received them, they did not fit because they were 9 x 9 X 1.3 inches. I am so disappointed. I had to return them. I am not sure if I should order them again."
3,"Too many characters, too little time","I have always really enjoyed the books in this series. That made my disappointment w/this one all the more--well, disappointing. The obedience class members were thrown in and never really developed. The ""old"" people at the nursing home were treated in much the same way. The new characters were static and two-dimensional. Add to that what seems to have been the obligatory sexual innuendoes and I just did not find this book as enjoyable as the previous ones. If this book were the first one read, I doubt that I would have bought another. As it is, I'll hope this was just a glitch."
3,A Warning For The Other Reviews,"Oh come on,the 3 Season 6 episodes on this DVD aren't so bad,their pretty good,my favorite one is ""Thomas & The Jet Engine"". But if you don't like them,just watch the 3 Season 7 episodes only. My favorite one is ""Bulgy Rides Again."" This goes for the scared children,if their scared of the 2 Season 6 Episodes,""Percy & The Haunted Mine"" and ""Scaredy Engines"",they should only watch the 3 Season 7 Episodes. This goes for Cloudy Harpe,if you want another DVD where Thomas is back to normal,then buy James Learns A Lesson & Other Stories(another DVD with the same composers,transitions,and camera work). End of story."
2,Annoying menu options,The first time the kids watched it they didn't mind the verbal descriptions in the menu. Subsequent viewings were very annoying because you can't jump past the menu to watch the movies. They won't watch it any more.
3,Thomas' Music Engine,"Do you like Ian Van Dahl-I Can't Let You Go, Where Are You Now & Believe? I think is Ian Van Dahl-I Can't Let You Go. I think is Ian Van Dahl-Where Are You Now?. I think is Ian Van Dahl-Believe. Thomas the Tank Engine brings music!"
1,Misleading Title,"When you read the title of this dvd you don't except it will have Halloween stories in it. That is just what it contained and I would prefer if the dvd producers would have given it a title to suggest that those types of episodes are on it so that those wanting to avoid those kind of stories would do so easily. If you don't want Halloween type of episodes of Thomas, then don't buy this dvd."
2,Furious with enormously long preamble,"You may be buying this DVD for a toddler. If you are, be prepared for the longest preamble in DVD history. What are the producers thinking? No parent of a toddler wants to sit through five minutes of preamble before they can actually play the movie."
3,"Long menu, but good episodes...","Pros:I like the episodes that are on this DVD, so does my 2 year old. There is a Halloween episode, however it doesn't scare my toddler. He's fine with it. Episodes: 5 starsCons:The problem is that the menu plays a cheap animation and literally takes five minutes while it explains what menu buttons you can press... there is no way to skip it and it is infuriatingly long and annoying. EVERY TIME that your child will want to watch this DVD, you will feel angry with the people who designed such a stupid menu. We have a lot of the other Thomas and Friends videos with easy menus to get through. Menu: 0 stars (Grrr!)"
3,"Maybe it's okay for older kids, but...","My 3-year old, who has seen many other Thomas videos/DVDs was really scared by this one - ""The Spooky Mine"" and ""Scaredy Engines"" were too much for him. He doesn't even want to watch it again, and based on his initial reaction, I don't want him to watch it again either."
2,Too scary for young viewers,"Thomas is usually a big hit in our house, but this DVD is way to scary for my two year old son. He got frighten and came running into my arms. It will be awhile until I attempt to play this DVD again."
1,Much Too Scary For Little Ones,"I rented this DVD for my 2 year old who loves all the Thomas movies. Unfortunately, this one had several scary episodes about ghosts, Halloween, etc. The night after he watched watched it, he screamed and shouted ""GHOST!"". It made me sad to realize that Thomas had introduced something scary to him so unneccessarily. I'm glad I only rented it, but I wish I would have avoided it altogether."
4,FYI - This has the Halloween themed episodes.,"This is another enjoyable DVD for any young children who enjoy the Thomas shows or playing with Thomas wooden or plastic train sets. It has 6 short episodes to keep it just over 30 minutes, which is much better than those 90 or 2 hour ones that are simply way too long for little ones to sit through. Also, there are two spooky episodes just in time for Halloween, one is Percy and the Haunted Mine, which is doesn't deal directly with Halloween, but has it's share of spooky night scenery, and the Scaredy Engines episode which follows, that is about Halloween. You get the usual extras with a few games and sing-alongs. Check out Thomas' Snowy Surprise for the Christmas themed episodes."
5,Great reading for athletes,"Even though the title is Real Men Do Yoga, and I am a female, I found it greatly interesting. Being an athlete, playing tennis 3 hours a day, and working out with weights another 1 hour, my body gets a lot of ""beating"". I discovered that doing yoga helps to balance my body and stay injury free (or heal injuries that happened before yoga). This book is great on describing the importance of athletes doing yoga, for increased performance, focus, balance and many other athletic benefits. I also like that it agrees that all training aspects are important: weight room, yoga, sport specific training. It's well written and easy to follow. I love the examples from real life."
5,Great book for the begginner to teacher!,"This is a really great book. Mr. Capouya has really opened a closed door that the culture has put on yoga and men. Up until recently, it was thought that ""only women do yoga,""; however, the author takes interviews from several pro athlethes to tell of their personal experiences with yoga. He also provides detailed instructions of yoga poses for the beginner as well as suggest routines for the budding new yogi. As a student of yoga as well as a teacher to high school student and college age males, having this book as a reference has made these guys feel more comfortable doing yoga when they hear that 6'5""+ 250+lbs pro athletes are doing yoga. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Gift idea gone bad,I gave this as a gift. He never used it. It may be a great product but I will never know.
2,Garbage,"Only about 20% of the book tells you how to actually do yoga. The explanation is clear and so it's fairly helpful, but there's so little info that a lot of basic material is left out. Most of the space - 80% is not at all an exaggeration - is spent on quotes from various guys, mostly athletes, talking about how great yoga is and how it isn't feminine or new-agey. If you want to spend your time reading a book that will convince you to do yoga, go ahead and buy this. You can have my copy. But if you want to know HOW to do yoga, look somewhere else."
3,Good for basics,I was looking for illustrated instruction on basic techniques that would improve my flexibility and range of motion. This book does provide clear instruction on some yoga exercises that can learned fairly easily and I've adapted them into my regular workouts. I'm a middle age male and some of the yoga techniques are beyond my capability and I wish I'd taken up yoga earlier. I was concerned about injuring myself since I'd recently read some articles on a large number of men being injured in yoga classes while attempting techniques better suited for women. This book focuses on yoga exercises that are suited for men. My only criticism is that some of the written instructions could be more detailed and clearer since that is the limitation of using a book for instruction rather than attending a class and getting in person training.
1,Worthless as water?,"I used biospot for over a year on my dog and 8 cats and had no problems. Then..one of my cats got fleas and I freaked out b/c I didn't want an infestation. I talked to my vet and he said that biospot was as worthless as water. Lovely. He said I had just gotten lucky. I have noticed that when I use frontline the animals don't freak out and act like it is burning their skin. Whenever I used biospot the animals would freak out and run around afterward, and then have a grease spot on their neck for a week. This doesn't happen with frontline."
4,"Inexpensive, effective, odorous",This product is just as effective as the more expensive Frontline or Advantage and is much less expensive. It has a very strong citrus (?) odor which my dog finds offensive: she runs in the other direction when she sees me take out the Biospot.
1,BIO SPOT-Fleas friend...,"I was very unhappy with this product. I bought it for my American Eskimo who was having a serious problem with fleas this spring being that we live on a mountain. I ordered the BIO SPOT, bathed and dipped him, dried him, then treated him with the BIO SPOT. In a week my poor dog was SWARMING with fleas and ticks. I gave this product a week to take effect to no avail. My dog was so miserable that he was crying while he scratched! I ended up re-bathing and dipping him...TWICE! I have now put him on the Zodiac Spot On. I am waiting to see the results of that. In closing, BIO SPOT just seems to be the fleas best friend!"
1,Bio Spot is Crapola does not work at all!,"Can you give negative stars?? Ugh Bio spot does not work, I had to wash him several times to get the fleas off him after I took him out thinking this would work he came back with a shite load of fleas. Don't fall for the line Oh it is only meant for light infestations and prevention. NO kidding that is why I bought it..! We are now treating the yard him and the house thanks Bio spot ."
3,Buy The Rest Of The 90's First,"Of the 90's Grave Digger catalog diffently give Sympthony a miss and buy this only as a fan, not as a first CD of the band. In my opinion it has the worst sound of all their 90's CD's and the music is too progressive. Each CD has it's own personality this one I dont like, want stuff to put your fist in the air, chant along with and bang your head to, this one aint the business.P.S. the latest CD is killer."
1,Wood,The replacement part is made of wood while the original is higher quality plastic. This is not the fault of the vendor but a substitution by the manufacturer.
2,not as pictured,The picture shows what my original roller looked like. The roller received is round wood without the flutes like the original plastic roller. And the part that the drive belt runs on has a big groove cut in it so the belt is only driving on the outer edges. I don't have much confidence in this lasting very long.
1,Update - Doesn't fit,"Even though this isn't an exact replacement, (this is wood, original is plastic), I was going to give it a try anyway. But..., there's no groove for the belt that spins it. Actually, there are several grooves, just not one where it needs to be no matter how I orient it in the vacuum. I'm returning it."
5,Great Product,After reading the complaints about it being wood I was skeptical about ordering this. However since Hoover didn't have any available I took the chance and now I'm glad I did. Yes it is wood...but it is very heavy duty and well made. I installed it within a few minutes and it worked great. I would recommend this product.
5,Great Purchase,This transaction was very successful and smooth. Great price! Textbook was in perfect used condition. I highly recommend this seller.
4,Very Fast & Cheap!!!,This product arrived quickly and was a steal! I would definitely buy from this seller again in the future!
3,Not quite what I expected,"I'm not sure I got the right product; it didn't look like the picture. I expected that the tea bags would be in an air tight bag, but in fact I got a big box of paper wrapped tea bags, and the box was just shrink wrapped, so when I opened it there was no protection at all from the air. The picture of the product makes it look like it's in an air tight bag. Anyway. The tea itself is tasty, but doesn't have the zip I expected from the only other time I had tried coca tea, and that was from a ten year old teabag a friend had brought back from Peru."
3,"Gentle, no lather","I might have gotten a faulty bottle of this shampoo, but it does not lather at all. This makes me want to use more and more of it. It seems to work, other than that."
5,Abba Pure Color Protect Shampoo,I purchased this item for my mom who was complaining of her shampoo reeking havoc on her hair. Now she is happy with the product and the shampoo has a nice fragrance to it. The large bottle last a long time. Definitely would recommend it.
5,The Book of Life - Dr. Michael Sharp,"Found so much important and timely information in this book. It was easy to read and so informative. I am a big James Twyman, Neale Walsch, Gregg Braden fan and this book is definitely up there with them!"
2,Simple and clear...but Unsatisfying,"Although the book is well thought-out, clearly taught, and simple to understand, I found the material that Hamburger actually teaches you to play to be weak. Most books like this one use the author's own compositions to teach with, and frankly, I don't find his riffs and phrases to be very interesting. I kept playing along and asking myself, ""why learn this phrase? I can't imagine wanting to play it."" Not very bluesy in the sort of gritty delta style that I was looking for.Also, he teaches in open D and open G, but has you changing back and forth way too often, without explaining why. If he's got a reason for doing so, he should explain it - when in fact he's actually coy about his motives, which I found patronizing.I haven't tried Woody Mann's book yet, but he teaches actual songs by the legendary Bluesmen like Son House, Robert Johnson, and Charlie Patton. I'm buying it instead of this one which I checked out from my local library."
4,Full time speaker phone only?,"I have read many reviews of this phone before buying. Then i bought the phone and found out right away that this phone works as a speaker phone all the time!only! 100%. There is the ""hands free"" mode. you know the speaker phone. But in the so called non speaker phone mode, it's still in a speaker phone mode. When i talk i cant here the person i talk to, and when the other person is talking they cant here me. Just like a non-full duplex speaker phone. I dont know if i can live with this phone now! Its like useing a walkie talkie. not a real phone. Its like ok my turn to talk , now your turn to talk. DID'NT ANYBODY REALIZE THIS! im the only one who notice's. Are all handset speaker phones like this? I dont think i will ever be able to tell untill i buy. That sucks. I gave it 4 stars because every thing about the phone is good, ignoring the strange walkie talkie mode only."
5,"""Cleveland, the Best Kept Secret"" shouldn't be a secret","This is another wonderful book from the pen of George Condon, long-time columnist for the Cleveland Plain Dealer and living legend of local journalists. He's very knowledgeable of local politics, honest in his appraisals and highly entertaining all the time. You should buy a copy of this book and prepare for a really great read. If you cannot find it right away, it's also available as an e-book at Cleveland State University's Cleveland Memory Project (sorry, I'm not allowed to give you the direct address)."
5,Mesmerizing and Original,"Putting Old English poetry to music sounds like a recipe for a ho-hum CD, but it works beautifully-- the words and music complement each other in an equisite musical feast. Listen to the exerpt from ""The Cloud"" to get a taste."
4,mermaid curtains,I bought a pair of these to go with the sheet set for my daughter for Christmas. They really lift the room & she loves them!
5,Impassioned ethereal/atmospheric black metal,"Now I know that everyone has been raving about Blut Aus Nords ""The Work which Transforms God"" but I think that this album has been overlooked in all the hype. Sure, it's a much different feel than the previously mentioned album. More traditional styled black metal with ethereal/atmospheric keyboards versus a black metal Godflesh if you will. But i'd have to say I like this just as much if not more. The creativity and passion just irradiate off the music. From damn near catchy riffs to highly melodic and engaging leads, a bass that's actually audible (!) , rasping black metal vocals, viking like sung choruses, passionate/forlorn sounding clean vocals and ethereal keyboards. Vindsval balances all these elements perfectly(texture-whise that is) while retaining an icy kind of atmosphere throughout the album. So be sure to check out the rest of Blut Aus Nords albums, The Eye and Children of Maane (other Vinsdval projects). Brilliant black metal."
3,Something different,This travel guide/football guide was certainly something different. Lots of team histories that include a great overview of each team's history in the NFL draft. Also provides some nice info about each team's town. The hard core football guy might have wanted more but this was a pretty good book.
4,A good overview of experiences from brain tumor patients,"I ordered this book when my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumor in October 1998. He was inundated with cancer books from family and friends, and this is one of the few books he actually read cover to cover. We were amazed at some of the stories and given hope by several in particular. The book reinforces that everyone's journey is a different one, and the particular tumor diagnosis is just one part of the story. I'd highly recommend this book, along with Rebecca Libutti's ""That's Unacceptable"" (if it's a high-grade tumor), to anyone faced with a diagnosis of a brain tumor. (Ms. Libutti's book isn't available through Amazon.com, but you can order it through virtualtrials.com.)"
2,not so great,Not that great. Much of it does not seem like space music. very so-so. I don't recommend this. Do not waste your money.
3,Hearts of Space: Universe 4,"Pleasant-listening CD. I expected a little more variety, but overall it's relaxing to listen to."
3,Not hands-on,"I was expecting an English book with interesting hands-on (active) ways to teach students the usual boring grammar concepts. This book is great if you just want a quick, organized way to learn or teach the mechanics of English."
3,Required for a class,This is your very basic English writing textbook. I don't know why it was required for a college sociology class.
2,No Leverage,This tool is a stamped piece that has sharp edges on the teeth that engage the bottom bracket shell. It chews up the finish of the notches. I never even got the bottom bracket off. It would have caused too much damage. You can't use a torque wrench with this tool either. I am going to purchase a Park cup type tool to see if that works better.
1,This is just rubbish,"Piles of names of what I assume are gangster, I don't know, the authors do an awful job of explaining what this is about. I want my money back"
1,Endlessly boring,"THis really little more than a pile of facts, and boring ones at that, tossed together between two covers and passed off as a book. It is, essentially, lists after lists of names of bad guys from the past. We learn nothing about them leaving the reader with the desire to ask for a refund."
4,Good but a little dated,"Overall it is a solid book, I enjoyed reading it but it does have a heavy emphasis on readers who plan on going into video game development professionally. Some of the examples used are a bit dated, there is no mention of newer games like WoW but it does have good content and worth the price."
3,All about the Heart and Soul,"Death brought them together; will the truth tear them apart? That is the dilemma in Angie Daniel's Hart and Soul.Following the death of her parents Calaine ""KeKe"" Hart finds out the woman she has known as her mother is not. She begins a search for her natural mother with just a thirty-year-old photograph of a group of student nurses. David Soul, a renewed acquaintance and playboy from college, recognizes one of the women as his mother in the photo and so they partner up to find the truth.Throughout this story Ms. Daniels does a wonderful job of developing the chemistry between the two. KeKe puts up enough resistance to put on a good chase but not so much that you become frustrated. Ms. Daniels also provides an easy steady pace with a few twists in the storyline. My true rating is a 3.5.Hart and Soul by Angie Daniels is a nice, flirtatious story.KotanyaAPOOO BookClub"
2,Not pleased,"After listening to the disk I was mildly disappointed. Perhaps it will grow on me, but I think the tracks seem somewhat dated and unimaginative for some reason. I think I should have selected a more recent disk and also think the CD is overpriced."
2,Save your money.,Found the wiper hard to use. Good idea but didn't work for me. Ended up using a tank sprayer instead.
2,Awkward to use,I bought this self wiping aid for my wife in the hospital and neither she nor the occupational therapist could get it to wipe or release sufficiently. Oddly enough a nurse has suggested using a pair of cooking tongs for the ability to quickly release the tissue after use.
2,Major Let Down,"I bought this phone because my 2.4GHz Uniden phone (which I loved) was have issues once I installed a home wireless network. I was expecting the same quality that I've had in the past from Uniden, but I did not get it.Cons1. Buzzing noise in the background with every phone call regardless of what channel you are on.2. The phone periodically drops in and out for a second or two in the middle of conversations.3. A minor issue is that the belt clip is really quite ineffective.I'm going back to my old 900MHz Uniden phone. That phone was always clear and I never had a problem with it."
1,Much worse than any cordless phone I've ever had,"This phone cuts out only 2 rooms away from the base station. There is static noise, and callers on the other end complain about sound quality. I can't go into the garden, which used to be no problem with my old 900 MHz phone."
5,My Daughter Absolutely Loves this Book,"I can't say enough good thing about this book. My daughter is 14 months. We borrowed this book from the library and ever since we read it to her, she wants to read it every night. It's hard to say no to her. She loves her reading time. This is one of her favorite books that she likes to read. We do hand motion for when we say 'Beep', 'Boom', 'flip', 'splash', etc... it's really fun for her.I would recommend this book to any parents/caregiver with a baby/toddler. The writing of this book is really simple and it rhymes as well."
1,Drunk Drivers - Gutter Politics,"An apt title for a book written by someone so familiar with the gutter.Take a trip through the politics of a small county's political underground with a bitter man consumed with hatred and vengeance as your guide. Follow him as he attempts ot justify his position in the Broome County (NY) Sheriff's Department and play the victim as he reaps the consequences of his own poor choices.Having become familiar with the entire set of circumstances from the luxury of an being an outsider, and having known the author for more than 18 years as well as the other players in this tale, it has become evident that his masterpiece will go down in the literary world right beside the works of Ted Kaczynski and Jason Klebold."
4,Honest cop deserves justice,"The book can be broken down into two parts: The first, discussed the authors upbringing and his steadfast determination to become a cop. The second, describes in detail, and with brutal honesty, of his rise and fall within his department, and of the corrupt sheriff who destroyed his career. It's extremely rare when a law enforcement officer speaks so openly about his feelings and I was impressed with his honesty. It's unfortunate that there are chiefs and sheriffs out there who are so incompetent, yet have the power to destroy such a promising career. I thought the book was extremely interesting."
3,A few good songs,"As the other reviewer wrote, when the Graaf sisters do whst they do the best, which is dance music, they are simply amazing. They are really pretty blondes who have been quite famous for a while in Sweden now, mainly for modeling but the record is not bad at all and could have been better. The song you got what I want is really very very good. If only the rest could have been as good."
3,It's not a kit.,"I pulled my motor, and found that the bellows on my steering rack were gone - rotted away completely. I ordered this while I was rebuilding my motor and suspension. Now everything is ready to go back in, finally received my ""Beck Arnley 103-2731 Steering Rack Boot Kit"" only to find it's not a kit.It's a boot.That's it.'Brake Kits' come with both sides.'Cylinder Head Kits' come with all the gaskets...'Dress Up Kits' come with multiple parts.Not this kit. This kit is a single boot.If you are going to rebuild your steering rack, you need two of these.And have zip-ties ready because you won't get them in the 'kit.'"
4,It's big!,"I mean, it's ginormous. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing depends on your needs, of course. I can see how it will be helpful for cooking for the troops-- but right now it doesn't really even fit on my small apartment stove.When I'm in a bigger kitchen/house (soon), it will be much more handy. I do wish it had a balance handle on the opposite side, though, because this sucker is heavy even when empty (much less when it's full of hot food)."
3,peeling non stick coating,"I loved this pan until a few months ago. I've had it approximately a year or maybe a little more. I think I bought it at Dillard's on a special for about $40. I abided by the directions on cleaning, not over heating and using nylon or wood utensils. For a long time things went well so I even bought a smaller size skillet or two without the lids. However, this was my workhorse and on the stove to all the time.All of a sudden a big place in the pan started bubbling up and became about 3-4 inches across. I had to removed those black non stick particles so they wouldn't get in my food. Now, of course, things stick. I contacted the company but so far have only gotten an email they are very busy. Who knows what will happen as I don't want to spend a lot of money shipping it back to them only to have them determine not to send me another skillet.If they do send me another skillet quickly and with no problem, I'll report back about their customer service."
2,Not Happy,"I have had this pan for less than a year, and the non-stick is already flaking off, even though we have been very careful about how we use it and how we clean it. The handle is also getting loose. I wanted a good non-stick pan that would last for awhile. It seems like I could have gotten as good a quality at Wal-Mart for how this is lasting."
3,delivery,the only problem i had was in delivery-- originally i was told it i would recieve the product in about 5 days-- i check tracking and that was confirmed-- item didnt arrive within in 2 days after last projected date and i began trying to locate it--USPS didnt respond to repeated inquiries and niether did amazon. i did infact finally recieve item some 10 days after last anticipated delivery/
5,Listen to this over and over,"I first heard this delivery when I was a kid in the 60's when my father managed a team of salesmen. The 33LP was played several times but of course I was too young to pay any attention. I purchased this CD recently and am amazed how much of an impact it had on me, not only to recollect my early years but also the powerful and dynamic message it contains. Now armed with advanced degrees in social sciences and versed somewhat in William James (quoted by Earl), I can attest to the validity of the message. What is as interesting is the fact that this recording DID mark the start of the the ""self-improvement"" bonanza that followed. ""Gurus"" such as Tony Robbins, Jim Rohn, Zig Ziglar, Brian Tracy no doubt relied heavily on Mr. Nightingale's message. Listen to this over and over! Only negative is that I can't believe with our technology we couldn't filter some of the the scratchiness of the background....otherwise, enjoy!!!"
3,Too much Introduction,"I was looking for a version that did not have quite as much introduction, and concentrated on the message that we become what we think about most. That is without any refersnces to sales or quota etc."
2,No success using this product,"This summer I decided to make all my own freezer jam. I first made strawberry jam using another company's product and it made very good jam. After reading some reviews on-line, and liking the idea of using less sugar, I ordered the Berdardin Freezer Jam pectin to make peach jam. I made a batch which turned out kind of runny, which I attributed to my having mistakenly followed the package's instructions for berry jam. So I bought more peaches and followed the instructions to the letter - and the second batch was even runnier than the first! I decided not to try to redo it as I had no confidence at this point that the pectin would thicken the jam. I use homemade jam to stir into plain yogurt, so it being runny is okay for that. However, there goes my idea for giving pots of jam as Christmas gifts."
1,Warning about Pyramid cable!,Be forewarned! The PYRAMID cables do not look like the picture. They're very very cheap quality. The 16 gauge wires are too thin... they're only 18 gauge. Very misleading.
1,Not 16 gauge,"It may be labeled 16 gauge, but compared to other brands it's not even close. Another reviewer suggested 18 gauge but that is way generous. I compared it to some Acoustic Research 16 gauge wire and it has 1/3 to 1/4 as much copper. It's probably on the order of 24 gauge wire. If you are looking for really cheap wire just to get the job done or for experimenting it might be worth $5....but if you are hoping for a bargain on some decent wire, keep looking!!BTW, the wire had a sorta purple insulation."
3,cute book but horrible ending,"My daughters and I loved this book until the last couple of pages. Lettice the rabbit has always dreamed of dancing and she takes the initiative to make it happen. She works and works and works, and she's a wonderful dancer. All her family cheers her on -- and then, all of the sudden the story takes a depressing turn. Her family abondons her and Lettice decides to stop dancing. My daughter asked why Lettice can't be a rabbit AND a dancer, too. I have no idea. Weird ending to a lovely book."
2,what the.....?,"Like the other reviewers stated the story starts out well, but than takes a strange and cheesy twist. Why would a little girl (or bunny in this case) who decides that dancing is her dream, just suddenly give up said dream because being just a bunny is better? It makes absolutely no sense. If during the course of her dancing experience she felt that she didn't like dancing then that would explain the ending, but her entire ballet experience is thrilling to her. What a waste of paper"
4,beautiful picture,"I bought this TV after two years of watching a fifteen-year-old twenty inch NEC, so naturally it benefits from the comparison. We only use it to watch DVDs and videos and we don't have a hi-def player so I don't know how it compares to other TVs in the hi-def mode, but it regular DVDs look bright, clean, and clear from a viewing distance of twelve feet. We Watched the Lord of the Rings trilogy and it showed up nicely on the 16/9 screen. The sound is tinny compared to the 20-year old Cerwin-Vega speakers through a cheap old Scott amplifier that we use when watching DVDs. For just over a thousand bucks it is a nice TV."
1,burn in hell edmond paris!!!!!!!!!!!!,"how could you even think that the catholic church, the only church that has been around since the begining of christianity, would create a group of peace, love, and acceptance preaching men that are secretly evil. Also Rome being the start of both world wars is a completely idiotic claim, like Germany wasn't the start in anyway? This book is just a complete falsehood."
1,Got To Hate Somebody.,"The author obviously thinks footnotes are equivalent to scholarly research.Written by a sad, perhaps sick, fellow. If you like hate mail this is great."
1,You call this research?,"This ""work"" has the authority of haste and hate. It is poorly written and badly researched."
1,Great novel!,"If you're looking forward to being entertained by reading a good novel, by all means buy this book. If on the other hand; you're looking for facts... don't waste your money (and time) on this work of fiction."
1,The Rotten fruits of Jack Chick,"When scriptural arguments against the Church fail... maybe twisting history can disprove Catholicism. This is an entertaining book to read because it shows how far Protestants are willing to go to defend their little Bible believing setarianism, but just make sure you take it with a grain of salt, as should be done with most Chick and anti-Catholic works.This book completely misrepresents history and tries to paint an order of priests as some bloodthirsty devils."
1,I would agree with the reviewer below..,"except that I would also give this book a 1 star (the lowest rating). The villain(s) are so stock/stereotypical that I had to force myself to finish. Jared's patience with the evil stepsister and her father seemed completely out of place, as did the heroine's patience with them. Also, the heroine's relationship to her stepfather was completely unclear, as was the fact of how she ended up under his guardianship. If you can puzzle out her family relationships to the evil Beatrice and her father, you are either wiser than I am, or a far more patient reader. I cannot recommend this book to anyone, unless you are willing to settle for the most hackneyed plot, and the most hackneyed characters (including the oh-so-sacrificial heroine)."
2,Poor quality!,"Good looking box (though on the small side), but the cardboard is way too thin and flimsy! Not recommended, i would not buy again!"
4,Fore!,"With so much to read, it's hard to imagine reading the same book twice. When it happens, there is good reason to pause and consider the circumstances, the motivation, and the result. This delightful little story delivers an image of the human spirit in a setting that is incredibly true to life.Anyone who reads ""Loopy"" will get a positive message: Good things happen to good people. That the characters are all Irish, that the story takes place against a backdrop of amateur golf competition, that the infamous Irish weather and diabolical seaside links of Ireland provide the setting, that more Irish whiskey and pints of stout are consumed than one could imagine, just adds to the brilliance of the story line. Read ""Loopy"" when you seek a jolt of positive energy in your life."
2,"Poorly written, weak story",Loopy is a pretty mundane story of a lad who discovers he has a talent for golf after suffering a severe injury in hurling. He gets a girlfriend. He sells his family's hay. He wins an amateur championship. Ho-hum.
4,Barbie's Midge doll,My 11 loves this doll. I wish it was around when she was six and I was pregnant with our second daughter. I would rather have my daughter play with this doll and myself teach her about where babies come from than letting her find out the hard way. She is the best Barbie I've seen yet. She has a real body. Most kids stuff Barbie with clothes anyway to make her pregnant.My daughters really love the fact that every doll in the Happy family set can actually hold the baby. I see nothing wrong with this doll. She is married and creating a family. In today's world how many real people can say they're doing the same?
4,My daughter loves her happy family,My daughter plays with her happy family all the time. It reminds me when I was a little girl and had all the heart family barbie stuff. I like that they are coming out with new things for it.And to the review about not being married maybe they should research before leaving such a review. She is married to Alan they had a big wedding set sold years ago. So she knows who the father is.
5,Deal With It!,"If you think this toy is bad, then just not buy it! It is so stupid when people are like ""this toy is bad, you should not buy it or your a bad parent if you do."" It is none of your buisness if someone buys it for their kid. Maybe, their daughter asked them about where babies come from and they don't want to tell them the details. So just get over it!PS: Watch what you say on your reviews because some litttle girl might want to know about the toy, and read some not so nice things people said about it."
5,midge & alan,"the story begins in 1991 when mattel released the wedding day midge set its was midge hadley wedding barbie dolls best friend the groom was alan sherwood, barbie roberts as the bridesmaid & ken carson as the bestman. barbie little brother todd was the ringbearer & kelly stacie's friend was the flower girl.little ryan appeared exactly 3 years ago in the kelly line. i really like this set especially cuase alan is back in the line i hope mattel will contuine making the happy family very nice dolls"
2,Groudy For Little Girls,EEU my mommy gave me this barbie for my berthday and i never played with it a lot cause Midge with her fat tummy isnt exactly what little girls like me are posed to see.So I have to wait to play with it til I'm 8.
1,Now I have seen it all,Ok so now Barbie or Midge is pregnant. But it is ok because she is married to Alan. Well why then is Alan sold seprately? My daughter and I saw this at the toy store tonight. She announced shocked that there was a pregnant Barbie. I looked at the doll and had to laugh I didn't really think that she saw what she thought she saw but sure enough Barbie or Midge really was pregnant. My daughter than asked me if she was single mom Barbie. I told her that until you buy Alan that yes i guess she is single mom Barbie.My daughter has played with Barbie as she has other dolls. She chooses the dolls by how they look and what they are wearing. She does not know that Midge got married a few years ago to Alan and that they have a son and now she is pregnant with a little girl. That is just to much pretend for her. This doll may not be inapropriate to some but to my daughter it was just to weird for her dolls.
1,Not quite so educational,"I have a problem with this type of ""toy"". I'm afraid because it is a toy, that little girls will not understand the motherhood in not a game! When did we as parents need a pregnant doll to teach our daughters about motherhood. I find this doll quite offensive!!!"
5,One Happy Family,"What better role model is there besides a mother; especially if she can manage a career and also a family? If people are really concerned with providing their children realistic and good role model; address the real issue of having a large bust-no waist doll as a role model. There is all types of Barbies, why not have a family oriented one?Very cute and lovable Barbie!!"
4,Teaches values,"Its a great way to teach young girls that its best to be married to start a family, that it takes the husband and wife to raise a child into a well adjusted adult. I bought this for my 6 yr old Granddaughter who has no Father and she loves it. It helps her to ask questions and us to discuss family values."
1,I only gave stars because they were required,"I know this will make me seem ""dated"", old fashioned & just plain stuck in a time warp but I can't believe this doll is on the market! I have seen similar ""pregnant"" dolls (for lack of a better term) over the years but they never seemed to catch on & I hope this one doesn't either. Perhaps it wouldn't be so disgraceful (that's my personal opinion of course) if Midge were packaged with a male figure--dare I say it--maybe even a HUSBAND! But since Midge has chosen to become knocked up, let's hope the next concept in marketing is at least for her to pay a visit to Geneticist Barbie for a DNA test to identify her ""baby ('s) daddy""."
1,not recommended for children,I feel that children are not being taught anything with a pregnant Barbie.....Barbie is supposed to be a career woman..Not making babies....It give off the wrong message to children.
1,NEWS FLASH! PREGNANT BARBIE DOLL??? I dont think so...,Ok...Now barbies pregnant WHATS NEXT??? And How does she get pregnant?? GO FIGURE! Why should a child PLAY WITH SOME BARBIE sending of the message that sex is cool or ok... Its just WRONG. I was NEVER like a FAN of barbies but this is like EXTREMLy INAPROPRIATE. I SAY THIS TOY SHOULD BE DISCOTINUED..Who eva buys toy......well....you are a HORRIBLE PARENT..
5,Matel can't get any better.,"i don't see anything wrong with this toy, i have read these reveiws and some said this toy is inappropriate. does that make a pregnant women inapropriate too? a child learns soon enough, why not let them learn from something they know and love. i may not be an adult, but that doesn't make me stupid. your child probably already know about sex anyway. are you going to ban the net cause there is a pregnant barbie on this site? why not let your child be the judge of what she likes or not."
5,I've got a great idea!,"Maybe the next logical follow-up would be to have breastfeeding Barbie, complete with nursing bras!"
4,This is a great toy!,I have a sister who just had a baby. This is a very educational and is a great gift when introducing a new member in the family.
4,Wonderful educational toy.,"This is a wonderful educational and beautiful doll that includes the mommy-to-be and the new baby. I bought the whole set for my daughter, which also includes the dad, the son and Doctor Barbie. Although there have been many questions and concerns about this doll, its a wonderful learning tool and fun to see such a happy family awaiting the arrival of a new baby. My daughter enjoys them along with all her other barbie dolls."
5,This is a great toy,"Ok, so here's what I think about this toy. I'm 18 years old and I played with Barbie for years. In fact I was one of those kids that wanted Barbie to have a baby. So what did I do, stuff her with tissue and make her pregnant. I think it's great that kids can have a Barbie like that. I would have loved something like her. She's already married because back in 1990 there was a wedding party and the grooms name was Alan. She also had a ring on her finger. She is still married to Alan and that's how it works. There's nothing wrong with her. It's a very educational for kids."
1,Absolutely Disgusting,"I just about fell over when I saw this doll in the stores. Barbie is a teen-age fashion doll, not an educational this is what life is all about toy. Call me old-fashioned, but I think if Ruth Handler could see this doll she would be turning in her grave. Mattel this concept is a ""no-go"". I would never buy this toy and it just gripes me to see it sitting on the shelves. We have enough teen-age pregnancy without toy manufacturers glorifying it. I collect repro Barbie's but this just might be the straw that brokes the camel's back."
1,I think this toy is totally inappropriate for a child,"I feel our children as it is don't know what it is to be a child. They are exposed to too much too soon. I think this toy is inappropriate for children, really a ""pregnant baby doll"". What next? Let children be children and adults be adults."
1,I hate it!!!!,"This doll is uneducational!Well,might be educational if kids are learning about child-birth and I think kids(including myself)are too young to be learning about that.I mean, magenet bellys don't sound that durable.(Other then that,who has a magenet belly???Honstly!!!) It just sounds sooooo nasty!!!!!!!Well,thats our review.(P.S.) DON'T BUY THIS CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,*TaKe iT oFF ThE sHeLvEs*,"I rate this toy a 1 because i think its nasty that they have a pregnant barbie, i mean come on..what are they trying to teach kids? barbie is a role model for some girls..and if barbie is pregnant, they are going to want to be pregnant. my little girl saw this barbie and when we were in the car she said ""mommy how do i get a big tummy like barbie, and how do i get a baby like barbie""! i think this should be banned! I give this toy a 1 for educational value also! and i rated a 5 stars for the durablity of this toy, i mean how can it break with that huge...stomach!?"
1,THAT IS A NO NO,LITTLE GIRLS ALWAYS LOOK AT BARBIE LIKE INTELEGENT AND STUDIESTAND THEY WANT TO DO AS BARBIE DOES.NOW CAN YOU PICTURE WHAT LITTLE GIRLS WILL BE LEARNING FROM THIS? THEY WILL ALSO WANT TO HAVE A BABY.VERY BAD IDEA..
1,Displease,"I'm very spark of mattel,that they would invent some doll that would gloryfiey a unwed mother having a baby. As a mother, I would never purchase such toy it just like buying the video games that teachs the children how to shoot guns and fight. I would like for these doll to be taken off the market. I have a young daughter whom i fight to teach her that life means so much more than having children without finishing school and having a degree with a career. Were is the support from the merchanerto back us help!!!!"
2,Overall did not like this workout - is very frustrating,"I would not buy this workout. It became too frustrating to do the workout...is very complicated, not at all easy to follow or figure out what they are doing in the exercise because each exercise on a particular muscle group consists of 4 different things or motions they are doing. They do not start out each exercise showing you in slow motion the 4 different moves you will be doing, only the first move you start the exercise out with. If you can't do the exercise, you are not working the muscle group. Sometimes they work the right side of your body and never come back to working the left side later on."
4,Get ready for a work out,"I have exercised for years, but this is my first home exercise video purchase. I don't get to take classes at the gym due to child care hours at my gym, so I figured on those days I can't make it to the gym, this would be a fun substitute. I enjoy how they break up the program with weights, box, and cardio, so you don't get too tired on one thing. Having three different videos helps break it up too. Although, the routine is quite fast in the beginning, I catch on a little more each time I do it. If you are unfamiliar with Step Aerobic lingo, it may be a little more challenging to you."
5,Love it!,"I just got this a few days ago and I am very happy with it.The videos alone are worth it. The cardio video is more complex but you can pick it up after playing it several times. The muscle video, is not complex, its mostly using weights and easy to follow. Its worth every penny."
3,The Firm with stepper,"Its really tough. I found it too hard to keep up with the ladies, I had to keep pausing it when we changed the position of the box."
3,xeo-anthropologist and ancient andriod vampires,"In this sci fi adventure a shape shifting female alien foolsan ancient killing android and an nearly immortal vampire well enoughto escape having her soul drained.She saves the universe from this ancient dreaded raceby assuming the shape of one of them for long enough to killthe powerful alien.The special effects and sets are pretty good and the plot and dialog aren't entirely bad, but it is definitely a 'B' sci fi with suggested sex and violence. It reminds me of some old space opera novels from the 50'swhich isn't all bad..."
5,wonderful product,"A bit pricy, but worth every penny.PROS:- Great quality speaker system on the handset (major plus).- Built -in answering machine with ALL the features one should have, including remote access.- Handset holds charge for a very good amount of time.- Easy to use menus. Easy to adjust volume on handset and base.CONS:- Price.- Handset is a bit heavier than I'm used to.- 2.4 GHz (if true) doesn't reach as far as you would think! I used to own a 900 MHz panasonic and the range of that phone was better.Bottom line: Go for it."
2,"Nice Features, Bad Sound Quality","What a terrible phone. It's reasonably priced, attractive, and has great features, and I really wanted to love it... BUT the sound quality is horrific. For some reason, the volume in the handset fluctuates based on the sound coming from your end. So when you speak, the sound mutes on the other side for a couple seconds, then comes back (which you can track easily because of the ample background static). It's like talking on walkie-talkies. After discovering this problem, I then bought a similar Uniden model (DCT5285) to see if the original phone was defective or if the problem was with the DCT line in general. Sad to say, the DCT5285 had the exact same problem. Bottom line: bad line of phones. I've had good luck previously with the Uniden TRU3465 phones, so I won't write off Uniden altogether -- just the DCT phones."
2,"Looks good, sound quality poor","Nice looking, compact, easy set up but sound quality is very poor. I have excellent hearing but must have NO background noise when talking on this phone or I cannot hear the person I'm speaking to. I also have to strain to hear the answering machine (and have silence for that as well) and the answering machine playback is always garbled and hard to understand. I was very disappointed. I bought this phone for that very reason - I guess I'm going to have to break down and just get voice mail through the phone company.The redial is ridiculous too - going through an obscure menu to find redial takes longer than just redialing the number. Why didn't they just put a redial button on the phone?"
3,Nice Features - Annoying Sound,"This would be a great pone except for one big problem: when you talk, the earpiece quiets down and cuts out just like talking on speakerphone. The volume in the earpiece is constantly fluctuating. I guess that's because each handset can be a speakerphone (a feature which works quite well... better than most speakerphones). But it was just too annoying more me so I had to return it. Otherwise it has many many features. Useless features like a giant phonebook, the ability to check the answering machine from any handset, and other silly gadgets mostly found on cell phones like playing Fur Elise for a ring tone. It seems built really well but it's just not worth the extra money."
1,Feeble,"Freeman doesn't make technical things easy to understand, because there's hardly any technical matter in the book. Whenever the going gets tough, his excuse is 'not enough space, so please check the Oracle online documentation'.I suppose it's good to have a compact list of areas which I now know have to be investigated, which is what this book provides. But it certainly doesn't do any of the investigative ground-work for you. And therefore it's certainly not worth the money I spent on it."
3,BUYER BEWARE-Only 6 Songs!,"It was unfortunate that I had bought this thinking this was the 12 song remastered airplay for the planet.This is a mini cd made by japan toshiba and only has the first six songs.Please dont be fooled as I was.As far as Jay Graydon-A great guitar player and Great writer producer etc.I also love Joseph Williams,ex toto singer.You wont be disappointed...IF...you buy the 11 song,plus bonus track remaster airplay for the planet!"
3,Useful brief work on analysis of nominal level data,"This is one of the entries in the Sage series, ""Quantitative Applications oin the Social Sciences."" The subject of this slim volume (just 82 pages long)? Analyzing nominal data. Nominal data are at the lowest end of the level of measurement. These are categorical variables, where the different categories have no numerical relationship to one another (e.g., religion, major in college, etc.). Only specific kinds of statistical techniques are appropriate for such variables. This book does a serviceable job discussing the essence of nominal data, measures of association (relationship between two variables)--including the odds ratio, the contingency coefficient, lambda, etc., and multivariate techniques (e.g., log linear models).Not the easiest reading book, but a resource for those willing to wade through the text.("
1,This is bad,"This is so bad, when I wrote a bad review and Amazon rejected it I actually came back to write another review.This stuff is so bad it doesn't warrant me spending any time writing a detailed review on why its bad, it just is.Trust me."
1,Range Problem,"I purchased this phone after my VTech was struck by lightning. Although the many features appealed to me, the clarity and range was all that really mattered and it was terrible on both counts. I could take my 2.4 GHZ Vtech to the far reaches of our backyard and still carry on a conversation, but this phone would have so much static that I couldn't even hear the caller. Also, the clarity of the phone calls weren't up to par. I had a difficult hearing the caller - as if they were in a well. I would not recommend this phone."
1,"I receive this phone as a gift, and we don't use it anymore.","My parents purchased this phone for us for Christmas last year. My dad is an electronics king, and loves to research to find the ""best"" of everything. Well, he was misled on this phone. There was always background noise, we could never hear the people we were talking to, and they could never hear us well.Also, the answering machine wouldn't stop playing unless we answered this phone. If we picked up any of the others in the house, it would keep playing.We finally just bought the cheaper 2.4 model ourselves and unplugged this phone and answering machine. Now it just sits here and looks pretty for when the parents come over. I definitely don't recommend it. I feel bad that they paid so much for it and it turned out to be such a bad system."
1,Don't waste your money,"I used this one time and it stopped working. The one time that I did use it, it took forever (3 days) to dry hot peppers which I had quartered. I'm sure it probably burnt out.I'll probably get another one with a little more power - probably starting at 1000 Watts. I advise you do the same."
2,highly unlikely to really happen,"What are the chances of having conections with the same people in the way that they do? This was an interesting book in some parts, but the use of ""coincedenses"" was quite sappy, I thought.Another big turn off for me is that the picture on the front was rather sappy. Maybe it's just me--it just didn't set right. It was kind of boring-looking and made them look like a boring couple."
2,Caution,"I'm sorry for rating this so low, but I'm writing the review to throw caution to the anime fan that has never seen this series. I have to mention that I love all kinds of animes and in my opinion I wouldn't recommend any anime that you couldn't watch for a second time, or even again and again. I do understand that people like this series, which are the fans who rated this so highly, and I respect that (which is good for them, and money well spent for them)... but unfortunately, I bought this before even watching one or more episodes. I bought both seasons, and feel duped. I thought it would have more of a storyline, more of all that creativity of which anime is. Not a bad anime, but not great neither (IMO). AND in my opinion they could have made two movies instead of two seasons.BTW,Season 1 ""Divergence Eve: Complete Collection""Season 2 ""Misaki Chronicles: Complete Collection""(If they were actual seasons IDK and really IDC)."
2,OH man...,"Well, I should have known from the cover but the price was soooo good...The bouncy breasts are so frequent and out of proportion it is just stupid...The story was not as meaningful as the atmosphere wanted you to believe...This is one of the few titles in my collection I am sad to have made the purchase on.I LOVE time travel stories, I always catch time travel movies and books. This one was not a highlight in my time traveling experiences.In some places the story was so shallow... I felt like I was in a kiddy pool. Not impressive... and the 3D looks VERY much removed from the art.Truly hard to watch. Completely a fan service anime... and little more IMHO."
5,Great second season,This season Misaki is traveling through different times throughout Earth trying to help others from being sad. Her friends come to here side and bring Misaki back and she finally realizes what she needs to do and that you can't control time.
3,Not Bad I Guess,"A little oversimplified for me I guess after having read two other books. Also the author seems to have a different school of thought as far as classification of the various ""lines"" and categories e.g. the main lines of Life, Head, Heart, etc he classifies and references by way of the 4 elemental system (earth, wind, fire, etc) and doesn't really explain much about sources or history or differences.Further, and this is just me, there's no real logic given behind why X means Y.. it's more like just a cold list of various hand characteristics and their corresponding meanings without much explanatoin as to ""why"", which i find personally impossible to then retain.Finally, there's no actual photos of real hands-- all illustrations are drawn-- which on any real hand it's pretty rare to have the lines neatly and evenly drawn like that of a neatly drawn line colored illustration."
3,Pretty drawings,It was somewhat informative but not a whole lot. The drawings were very colorful. Wouldn't recommend it for in depth analysis.
3,Someone Else's Child,"I felt that ""Someone Else's Child"" was a basic fast and easy read. If you are looking to pick up a book that will not cause you to have to think to much, this would be it. I would not say it was a bad book, but I would not say it was a good book either. I felt the story line was on the same path as those of Danielle Steele. Just a story. I did not walk away from this book with any enlightenment. Not one I would go out of my way to recommend."
3,Good Grusin music for Pollack film,"This soundtrack to the 1990 Sydney Pollack film features a good selection of Latin jazz and romantic music that follows the plot of this film, a romantic drama set in late 1950's Cuba."
2,Only good for people who have done their studying done,"This book would be good for people who are ready to take the test but want to review materials quickly before the test.But if you just started studying (my case) and want more example problems, then this book would not provide what you are looking for."
5,Excellent product for men.,"Absorbs quickly and completely, not greasy. Pricey, but considering the fact that you only use a few drops per application, it lasts a long time. I am an avid golfer, get a lot of sun and I have patchey dry and occassionally problem skin, but this products works well and have bought several times."
4,Nice price,"If you need a cheap set of bits here you go. I own one of their 29 piece sets and got it for only $15 I think. They are not precision instruments buy any means but will drill though wood, plastic and steel at a decent speed with satisfactory results. And since they are standard tip, they can be re-sharpened easily with a drill doctor or similar product to last a long time."
5,Great cheap bits...,"Well, for the price paid, they are great. Haven't used them heavily, but then again, they are only for occasional household use. They do great at drilling through wood and aluminum. Haven't tested them through anything tougher yet, but I expect they'll hold up nicely."
4,Excellent mathematical reference,"This is the ""textbook"" for counters. What I mean is that it reads like an excellent textbook, but is not useful for the beginning blackjack player. If you are that, purchase KO blackjack or Basic Blackjack. Then, when you begin to develop an interest in the theory of BJ (hence the title) this is a must buy.Why does the other review insist on calling him Miller?"
5,The Most Advanced Blackjack Book Ever Written,"The Theory of Blackjack is must reading for the advanced card counter. It is unquestionably one of the best books ever written on card counting. The great thing about this book, is that it is highly accurate, written by a mathematics professor formerly of California State University. The author also possesses some playing experience."
4,good book.,"griffin, himself, though, says that he would recommend starting with a different, easier book if you are weak in the math department. since i am weak(er) than i thought i was, i am finding the book a bit of a challenge.also, it just makes me think, because here's this mathematician who even wrote a book on the subject, yet he writes that he never actually won much money playing blackjack. obviously -- assumably -- it's not because he didn't understand how to play. just makes me realize that there's no guarantee that the laws of probability are gonna turn in my favor anytime soon. Like what's his name said, in the long run, we're all dead. so that don't do me too much good :("
3,Really a Book for BJ Computers,"This book is for advanced players who are computer literate. It's main purpose is to help program a BJ computer for actual play. Additionally, one can program a BJ simulator to evaluate all the other counting methods on the market to rate their effectiveness.This is not a good read for beginning or advanced BJ card counters. It is for those ""experts"" who try the fringes. Furthermore, having a BJ computer in a casino is now illegal in NV."
2,Blowing my own horn.,"Well you get what you pay for and paying only [...] bucks for an air horn was not a lot. This horn is not what I expected. Lately it appears there a lot of drivers on the road that must have gotten their licenses on line somewhere or via mail order. People are driving 20 mph ""below"" the posted speed limits. I want a horn that when I hit the switch the reason I hit the switch gets out of my way ... with no hesitation! This thing sounds weak. My wife said it sounds like a sissy horn? I'm putting together the details of an air train horn hook up. I'm looking at spending 200+ so it better be 10 times louder. I did have a small problem with the way I was hooking it up and telephoned Wolo. After only a couple of minutes I actually ""spoke"" to a gut that really helped me."
4,A Bleak and Desolate Musical Landscape,"This is an excellent black metal album. The 1 star is removed for this being a 2005 re-issue from Candlelight music, the production is really sub-par. There are a lot of ""drop-outs"" in my cd pressing. However,you will go on an abysmal journey with Vindisval. Most of the ""vocals"" are well, pained, tortured shrieks. Track 4 is a well-done ""clean"" choir chant. Powerful guitar riffage throughout, with sad and eerie keys. Worth the time and effort. My favorite track is ""Journey from Ringthorn. Originally recorded in 1995 and has the traditional raw and gritty sound of black metal at that time. Get this."
1,Disgusting,"This ginger is disgusting. Since pickled ginger has almost no calories no matter how you make it, the nasty taste of Aspartame is unnecessary and highly undesirable. I recommend The Ginger People Organic Pickled Ginger.The Ginger People Organic Pickled Sushi Ginger, 6.70-Ounce Glass Bottle"
3,Unexpected,"I have Sevag's Visual CD and absolutely love it. I thought that Bridge would be similar to it but it is not. Bridge is laced with too much jazz for my taste. To me, it seems like it is not even the same artist. Personally, I wish I could send it back. Hopefully it will grow on me."
3,Deja Vu,"OK, either Howard Shore is ripping off ""White Wings"" with his ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy soundtrack, or Oystein whas influenced. I'm thinking Howard is in the wrong here..."
3,WELL what is this,Ok album. its much better then those lame death/gore metal bands that make metal look stupid.
2,"Nice plan, poor execution","This music is wonderful, very moving. Therefore, it is even more of a bummer to report that the recording quality is substandard. There is a noticeable hiss throughout each singing track. I like to play my music loud, but the hiss is so distracting that I cannot do so with this disc."
4,Hisssssssssssssss,"The CD just arrived today and I'm listening through my trusty Sennheiser 280HD cans.If ever a recording cried out for remastering, this flawed masterpiece certainly does.I love sacred choir music and this music is gorgeous! Nobody on God's green or snowy earth worships like the Russian Orthodox Church."
5,The music is magnificent!,"Secred Treasures: Choral Masterworks from Russia is a CD with beautifully music well interpreted. Wonderfull to listen, if you need some rest."
4,Pretty good material- recordings not all great,"The material is engaging and the performances seem good. The recording quality varies significantly. Some pieces are perfectly rendered and some are, as other reviewers have noted, covered with high-frequency tape hiss. There may have been a master doing the mastering, but there's obviously some limit to how much of that tape hiss they can remove. The original must have been pretty bad.It would not stop me from buying it again; it's wonderful music. Just annoying to have the hiss all over some the good pieces."
4,Vietnamese-English Dictionary Translator: Electronic,"The Vietnamese-English Dictionary translater is very user friendly, great if going to visit Vietnam. The only drawback is the keyboard is very small. Would still recommend."
4,Great story!,"I read the whole series of the Angelique books years ago. Last year I started reading it again and I have enjoyed it a lot. This book is 1 of some 10 books. In this book Angelique finally climbs up to the top by being next to Louis XIV, the Sun King, and his court. A lot happens here... she also learns how to survive in the midst of intrigue and power play, however... You'll nee to find out what happens :)I love the whole series, the story is very imaginative, inspirational, has a strong female character, and it has history as part of the story. Wonderful romance and good character development.I understand that there are still 3 books to be translated from French into Spanish. The author is still alive but doing other things, so unless you and I learn French we may not have the opportunity to see what happens and how it ends.So, you are in for a good read if you like the elements I have mentioned. It is a book well written and well translated. Enjoy!"
1,The worse of her books so far,"I've been the most loyal fan of Mary Balogh. I loved her works and read almost all of her books that I could find. I could not wait for her new books to come out. When I read the Ideal Wife I couldn't believe that it was her work because it was so horrible. The heroine was so fake and pretentious to a point that gave me goosebumps. I couldn't finish it which I never did before. I'm so glad that I've read her other books before I read this one. I hope this will be her only ""worse"" work because I still want to try her future books."
2,Characters who have extremely irritating personalities,"The lead characters were very irritating to me.Abigal is an incessant talker, one of those who people who seem to have absolutely no idea when people are tired of hearing them ramble on. I have never had a character in a book drive me insane the way this character did.Miles, though described in the book as an atheletic handsome man reminded me of small geeky Niles Crane from the television show Frazier. I could not get the image of Niles Crane chasing around behind Daphne Moon's skirts saying yes dear, anything you want dear, out of my head. Even his wardrobe, which was described several times in the book seemed to scream the fact that he was a little on the feminine side.Not a good book and I would not recommend it unless your definition of romance is a feminine man who lacks a backbone and a bossy, blabering women."
2,A dissapointment for those that love Mary's work.....,"Mary Balogh is one of my favorites but the Ideal Wife might not have been the best choice to republish with a new cover, it seems outdated in dialogue. The details were all ""too much"". The plot was too much, Abigail was too much and bordered on annoying, Miles was too much, too good based on the circumstances. I would recommend reading Mary's newer more polished and crisp work. The Slightly and Simply series. Because I liked those so much I was buying what was on the shelves, I found the Secret Pearl to be a disappointment as well. I think that I'll try her new Huxtable series and leave her older works on the shelves."
4,Sweet,"This is a sweet, happy book. Although there was no big adventure, it left me smiling through the whole book."
3,Ok....,This book was ok.. I give it 3 stars... storyline was drawn out and the sex scences were horrible... did he ever please her in this book?
2,Not Sure I would read More,"The writing is good. I liked Abby and Miles except in the bedroom. There I was very disturbed. Ok, we've all been there--I totally get the reality of it taking a little while for her to overcome her inhibitions and be able to find fullfillment. The part that really bothered me was that her husband, who was falling under her spell, didn't seem to notice or care that she was left unfullfilled 2x a night for the first week of their marriage. He didn't try to talk to her, question her or draw her out or even care that she lay under him like a board as long as he got what he wanted. The worst was the night they had an argument and he decided to skip the preliminaries and get the deed done quickly so he wouldn't keep her awake. She felt nothing while he did he business. I would kill my husband if he ever tried! Not my idea of romance! If you ignore the bedroom scenes the book was great. Unfortunately I like the whole package for my romance."
2,Not up to her usual standards AT ALL.,"Mary Balogh is one of my favorite authors. So even though I expected this book to be dull, I had to read it BECAUSE it was Mary Balogh.However, Mary Balogh completely disregarded her characters' feeling the whole way through. The initial personalities were ignored, and the personalties were altered so much sop that I feel she wasn't even paying attention when she wrote this. It is a dull, nondescript, clone of her usual perfection.Do not read this if you have never read her before. Some of her most amazing novels are More Than a Mistress, Slightly Wicked, and Slightly Married.I do not recommend this book at all. Sorry, Mary. :]"
2,Just overview of Oracle HA technology,"The writers like to subsitute the Oracle manual in OTN but make no difference . eg, I wanted to setup the Dataguard through EM10g Grid Control. In fact , the creation standby database wizard was filled of bugs and user can't make use of it till patching and huge manual works. It's no doubt that writers never tried on this features. The book is rather splotchy and winding."
2,Weak at best,"I was suspicous about any book with claims to cover three large topics, and I was quite right.The book has OK high coverage, but is lacking on depth and detail, especially with RAC. The RAC section does not have enough details to be of much benefit to anyone using it.Evene the title is fishy because Data Guard is a low availability option and not high by todays standards.A real HA option is Oracle Streams, but it was not even mentioned."
1,Boring and repetitive,"This play was a real bore; there was no action or twists and turns. The story was very slow moving and nothing seemed to happen.The book focused on the idea that every girl in high school is a possible conquest. I felt that religion was over-emphasised, especially when you consider that most American high school aren't the slightest bit interested in religious matters. This book may represent life in colleges in extremist religious states such as Utah, but it doesn't represent America as a whole.I was very disappointed at the lack of editing. I got the impression this book was rushed on to the market; perhaps Kim was short of money or something."
1,Gives a false impression of American college life,"Unfortunately, this is not one of Christian's best books. In my opinion this play tends to `drag on' and is rather boring and `one-dimensional'.The title of the book leads(Ping Pong, a play about American college life) the reader to believe that the play is representative of life at a typical American college, however the story focuses onrelationships and gives the impression that all American male students are obsessed with sex and infatuated with women. In as much as relationships are an important aspect of college life in the United States, I feel that the author could have brought in other aspects e.g. academic life, non-sexual relationships including enmity and rivalry/competition.Whilst I would never advocate advising someone not to read a particular book/novel, I feel that the reader needs to treat the content with a degree of skepticism."
1,Rather slow and predictable,"This play takes rather a long time to get going and gives the impression that college life in America revolves around sex and women.The character Steven is not typical of your average American high school student e.g. he is so infatuated with the women behind the desk (who he barely knows) at the sports centre that he would play a game in which has little or no interest just on the off chance of seeing her. I would be very surprised if all American high school students were so desparate for a relationship that they would behave in this rather irrational manner. I can only assume that the characters in this play represent a very small minority of students at colleges in America.Overall, the story is very predictable and the characters unrealistic in terms of their behaviour patterns.I would advise the reader to avoid this play as it gives a very one-sided account of American college life."
1,crap,"'Ping Pong' is the worst play I've ever read. It is boring, there is no action and the story just meanders along without reaching a satisfactory conclusion.The characters make inappropriate and out of context declarations to each other. The storyline and plot can be summed up in a pamphlet. This uninspiring book isn't worth a penny of your money; it really is awful in all aspects."
1,Not good,"This book gives a very distorted impression of American college life. The storyline overemphasises the importance of religion to young Americans and the role its plays in their lives. The characters seem to spend an unusual amount of time discussing religion especially Christianity, when you would expect them to thinking more about other issues such as fashion, relationships, sport etc.I found the dialogue between the characters to be stilted and unnatural and the standard of English used was sketchy to say the best.This is certainly not the best play I've read and not one that I'd recommend."
1,yet more atrocious tosh,"Curious, don't you think, that reviews like this one:'The characters behaved in unrealistic ways e.g. men would approach women, who were complete strangers and ask whether they would marry them. I accept that love at first sight is possible, however I've never heard of two strangers agreeing to marry when they've just met. The novel appeared to be based on the sexual fantasies of the author . . . 'Match up rather well with the complaints received by Cambridge University Law Faculty, and Jesus College (from which Christian Kim has been, or is hopefully about to be, forcibly ejected). A large number of complaints have been received from female students, stating that Kim harrassed them, bombarded them with demands that they marry him (when they had only just met), or touched them inappropriately. And he continues to protest his innocence? Maybe he'd do better to keep his fantasy world inside his head, and not inflict it on the rest of us."
1,"WARNING!!!!!! wrong track list, samples, and reviews","LOOK OUT -- The CD shown in this listing (Nino Rota: Works for Piano) is not the CD that goes with the track listing, music samples, or other reviews (Bruno Coulais: Microcosmos). Make sure you are ordering the item you want. I ordered the Rota thinking I was getting the songs that turn out to be Coulais and actually got a completely different CD."
4,"ben bon, pour un nouveau adepte de Mac",Ce livre donne l'occasion au nouveau utilisateur de Mac OS X de comprendre les dessous de OS X qui sont sembleble au système Unix.Recommandé.
5,excellent door handle great price!,bought a set elseware unchromed not the easiest to maintain a shine on. i then bought a set from amazon brushed chrome much nicer looking and easier to maintain. great price and quick delivery very happy with my purchase wdm.
5,Love this bar!!,"I really like these bars and the price is better on Amazon! I haven't tried all of them, but intend to. My favorite so far is the Almond & Apricot Yogurt!!"
5,Let it snow!,"I love this type of DVD with beautiful pictures to fill a big screen and lovely music, and this one has it all. One of my favorites. Lovely."
1,Waste of Money,"I found this DVD to be absolutely awful. The snowscapes are very inferior indeed - boring and unappealing - when snowscapes should so easily be gloriously beautiful.In those where absolutely nothing is happening, I would have done far better to have just saved some Internet pictures to look at. In ones where snowfall is taking place, there is no sense of scenery change due to snow accumulation or focus on interesting shapes made by the snow.The music is tuneless, grates on the ear and does not match the moods and different types of landscape on display.I would not have believed that such a potentially beautiful and magical subject could be so badly produced. This DVD is a waste of the money and viewing time."
2,glasses,These are horrible looking. I cant imagine whos face they would look good on. The quailty is poor. I actually threw them away
5,A great text on construction materials - but put of print,"I have used the book over 15 years in teaching construction materials. The author did a fine job in wriiting the book, however, all good things comes to an end. It was time for this book to go and the publisher decided to stop printing this book. I wish the author included other new bloods to renew the book and continued to serve the educators in disseminating knowledge about engineering materials..."
5,Good book for reading and reference,"This book does a great job of covering all of the PL/SQL language, as well as covering pointers about SQL Plus and some preliminary config. It does a good job of covering basic and fundamental PL/SQL, as well as covering newer features for those of us that have been coding in it for years.Newbeeis and Vets will both get a lot from this book."
2,Extremely poorly written book.,"This is A poorly written book. The programming examples used in the book are not explained in any detail. For instance, in Chapters 3 and 4, it uses functions and procedures and other objects without providing any explanation for the benefit of those new to PL/SQL programming. I really don't understand how could a such a book be written. In places, even the naming scheme is confusing and requires an effort to comprehend. For someone who is starting out with PL/SQL programming, I definitely would not recommend this book."
2,the Feuerstein book is significantly better,"Yes, this book is an ""official Oracle"" book, yet it's significantly worse than the ""PL/SQL Programming"" book by Steven Feuerstein. If you want to learn PL/SQL, buy the one from Feuerstein, if you need a reference then use something else because this is not a reference."
5,Solid book,"All-in-all this is a solid book. I use it for reference regularly, and have used a few of the examples in my development. I found that sections that overlapped with Oracle docs were more in-depth here (I finally understand lob storage). There were a few areas that I would have liked to see more coverage on, such as error handling.I did find a few typos in the text, but they seemed to be addressed in the errata. (...)"
3,"An Interesting Case, But A ""Not-So-In-Depth"" Look At It","This book about the murder of Doris Angleton in Texas has a very easily readible narrative by the author but seems to be lacking in background information on some of the principles in the case. I came away after reading it feeling like their was much more to explore in the relationship between the Angelton and her husband that the author didn't delve into. While the story itself, complete with a bad brother - sibling rivalry - a possible revenge motive, is interesting it lacks the details that other more researched books offer that gives a real good true crime novel it's ""must read"" quality. I would recommend reading it just for the unusual nature of the case but with some reservations. (If you have another book that sounds as interesting - read that one first)"
1,death in texas,I HAVE READ BOOKS SINCE I LEARNED HOW TOO READ. I AM 55 YEARS OLD NOW THIS BOOK HAS NOT INTRESTED ME AT ALL CARLTON SMITH IS A MUCH BETTER WRITER THAN THIS. I PUT THE BOOK AWAY AFTER READING IT HALF WAY THROUGH. SORRY IT WAS JUST TO HARD TO FOLLOW
3,Adequate.,"I'd seen the 48 Hours report and don't think the book offered any new, compelling information...was disappointed."
1,Poor Quality Control,Cross brace came with holes pre-drilled but no threading insert for screws. Ended up having to glue pieces together.
2,Go for a different chair,"When I got the chair it was missing two of the threads necessary to put the chair together. Called the company and they were very nice and sent the new part. I didn't get it as quick as I would have liked, but they were still very nice. When I went to put the rest of the chair together, which was very easy to do, I noticed that the front bar had cracked where you screw it together and the new part that they had sent me was also cracked. Not what I would call quality. Then to top it off the chair is not even level. Thought it might be my floors, but I tested it in several rooms."
4,High Chair,"I came upon this product while searching the web for such a model. I was pleased with the material used in the chair, however; it took some adjusting to get the chair to sit straight. We had to adjust one of the screws and it left a mark on the wood. Other than the minor adjustment, I am very pleased with the chair."
3,Lipper High Chairs,We were a little disappointed with the high chairs. They were purchased for our church. It took longer than expected to put them together because some pieces came apart and had to be repaired.
4,Great for the right kid,"Personally, I'd give this chair 5 stars, but I know each child is different. My son screams if he's placed in a confining chair with a big tray. We noticed that he was better in the restaurant-style chairs when we went out to eat, so we ordered this one. This is a great option for us. It's a pretty dark wood, matches our table, and has a snug strap to keep my boy safe. It's easy to keep clean (unlike some of those big plastic ones), and light enough to move easily."
1,Second Faulty Packaging!!!,"This is the second one of these chairs that I have purchased online (this one from Amazon)and both times the packages arrived either missing parts or including the wrong parts. My husband opened the box and tried to assemble it on the morning our family with baby was arriving from out-of-town, a few days after the Amazon delivery. He was very mad and frustrated to learn of the faulty packaging, especially after already having been through this problem before with a new box from ebay. Since time was limited, we found a quick alternative from Ikea which worked out even better. Be forewarned: expect mistakes in packaging and don't wait until the last day to discover it!!!"
4,cute highchair,"Likes:I got this highchair because it matched our kitchen.I've worked in restaurants and know they are easy to clean.Its also pretty compact, can be pushed under our table so it doesn't take up a ton of room like a lot of highchairs.It was very easy to put together and sturdy."
5,Easy way to make my baby happy!,"I got this high chair after getting too frustrated putting together other, more sophisticated chairs. This is simple, and my daughter LOVES it because she can sit up with the family instead of detached from us. It only took me a few minutes to put together and is sturdy. The little wood caps did fall off, but I got some wood glue to keep them on and they're fine."
1,Dangerous splinters,"We used this product for a month or so. The wood began splintering and cracking. It became too dangerous to use anymore. Returned it for refund. Also, it did not come with enough screws to assemble fully; we had to get more at the hardware store."
2,Inferior Product,"This high chair is not what is described. Instead of having pecan finish, it's orange. Also, the finish is inconsistent in the quality of application - heavier is some areas and lighter in others. The photo of the product is not the same as what was shipped."
3,Grandchild's Hi-Chair,"The chair is structurally sound and was easy to put together. The wooden buttons supplied to put in the holes where the screws are located do not stay in. This is due to inconsistent hole sizes. One hole was drilled over a knot in the wood and is not perfectly round as it should be. But this is only an appearance problem. The real problem is in the safety buckle. The buckle is a quick release type often found in luggage. But the quality of the buckle is lacking. Our chair is only used when our grandson visits, about once a week. The buckle broke about six weeks after we got the chair. After a visit to a sporting goods store and $4 expense the buckle problem was corrected with a new sturdier belt and buckle."
1,VERY disappointed!! Bad screw and sent wrong side panel!!,"We received the item and very disappointed! We received a faulty screw- didn't have a hole in the center so the allen wrench AND one of the sides was the wrong panel! We were supposed to received a side A and side B and we received two side As. UGHH! Horrible QC on the manufacturer! And with safety as #1 for my little son, this is one of the MOST disappointing products I've ever bought on Amazon, and I buy ALOT from Amazon. I'm writing Amazon to let them know. Terrible."
1,terrible experience,"I jsut felt I was fooled by reviews below. So, I would suggest you guys know my terrible experience before you make your order.The high chair comes with several big sratch on the body. Even more, some screws do not have hole. So, I cannot assemble the high chair at all.I called the custom service. The lady was very rude, irresponsible. She just didn't care about my issue at all."
1,Piece of junk,"Poorly made chair ill fitting joints, screw plugs keep falling out.advertised as being made in Thailand but the box says made in Vietnam never would have bought anything made there."
2,OK for the money,The highchair was somewhat easy to put together except for the fact that one piece did not quite line up an as a result the screw kept stripping. In installing some of the screw hole covers some of the woodplugs kept falling out. Have some Elmers wood glue ready just in case.Would not reecommend it for everyday. Good for the occasional grandchild visit.
5,Great toddler chair!,"I bought this highchair for my 18-month-old daughter in lieu of a booster seat. So glad I did! Very sturdy, well made and easy to assemble. It's the perfect height and great for art projects at the table."
5,Good quality.,I bought this for my 18 month toddler boy. It was very reasonably priced and I am very happy with how sturdy it is. It was easy to put together. My son enjoys sitting at the dinner table with the rest of the family now.
3,Highchair,"We would have given this chair a rating of five, but the color was much lighter than pictured in the sample on line. We returned this item."
2,Not the best I have ever used...,"I have owned at least ten hard drives, most of them by Western Digital, most of them purchased used. Some died, eventually, but that's life with used equipment. I got one of these (WD1200BB), new, and it died in 18 months -- not even my office computer, just my home computer. I think that these have a low price and a minimal warranty for good reason.Not that it didn't work well for 18 months..."
1,why send an adult childrens's underwear?,"No where in the advertisement for this item did it say that it was children's underwear. I am now stuck with a pack of kids undies, which will cost more to send back than to keep.Very poor form!"
2,Pretty Dull,"Though this book seems like it might be scary and intriguing on the outside, it is really quite boring and the stories are hard to read without skimming. I would not recommend this book."
2,Metra 70-9003,nice product but does not fit my car. Although it is listed for my make and model it is incorrect.
3,GTI 02 Adapter,Part and instructions received. Appears to be too cumbersome. I actually haven't followed through with install. Monsoon stereo and amplification setup doesn't match up with selected head unit....Oh well.
2,Not what I expected....,"It says it is 200GB, but no matter what I tried when installing it, I could only get about 130 GB....very disappointing."
5,Kicks ass!!,"Had the original Pessimiser/Theologian copy that i listened to till it wouldn't play anymore. Glad they re-issued it. Relapse has a habit of doing that, good for them! Love Relapse! Anyway, this band is awesome!! Can't decide if this album or if Blaze.... is better. To me, their two greatest albums!! Liked Curves and Zoloft too! Heavy just doesn't begin to describe them but can be one of their greatest attributes along with a killer groove, awesome vocals and negative lyrics. Not good at describing all that makes up a quality band. Leave that to the magazine writers and reviewers. In my book these guys f in ROCK!! Still need to hear Bridges and their newest effort. So much to listen to and so little time!"
3,Helmet Jr.,"There are a lot of Helmet rip-off bands today (Limp Bizkit, Korn, thousands more) but I do believe that 16 was the first. Thankfully, they didn't do a poor job of it. Taken on their own merits, 16's songs are pretty damned good. Heavy, tight, and hard. The bad news is, 16's two best records were their first and second albums, both of which are long out of print. (To add insult to injury, their best album, Preoccupied, was for some bizarre reason published only in Japan on the Toy Factory label.) The good news is, several of the songs from Preoccupied appear on Drop Out. More bad news is that the best song, Wash Me, isn't one of them. More good news is that Wash Me is available on their next album, Blaze of Incompetance. More bad news is that it's not the same session as the version on Preoccupied, and they failed to reproduce the greatness of the song. The good news is, I'm done writing this lame review."
1,Didn't work with my laptop,I have an older laptop with only USB 1 ports. This needed USB to work properly and I also had trouble with the software. Returned the product.
2,so so,ok collar but after it got wet it lost its blueness and is now grey. has also come loose a few times.
2,Poor physical design,"I purchased this memory card reader for use with my digital camera's memory stick Pro. The reader does not have any kind of spring-loaded memory stick eject, or any eject button. You just have to pull the card out with your fingers. When a memory stick pro is fully inserted into the reader, the plastic edges of the reader are wider and longer than the card. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to grab onto the memory card - even with my tiny fingers. For someone who intends to use the reader with a card more-or-less permanently installed - it should be fine. The reader will close shut safely around the card. However, if you will need to insert and remove cards frequently, I DO NOT recommend this device. In my case, this physical design flaw makes the reader useless to me. I should note that although the plastic case design feels flimsy, it does open and close easily.I gave it 2 stars because it DOES actually work for transferring data, and will suit the needs of SOME users."
2,I don't know what I can do with this,"I bought this for easy transfer of pictures from my digital camera with SD memory card anywhere not home and sometimes from other peoples memory card (xD and memory stick)..First of all I was disappointed with the flimsy, plastic design and the size of it. But it would have been ok if it worked!..IT DOESNT READ my SD card. And as menetioned in other people's review hard to insert and take out the cards! I'm scared if the cards get scratch and ruined whenever i do it. I wish I have bought this after reading amazon reviews...it's useless now. I'm lost how I can get sd card work on this and if I do, scared of frequent use for the flimsy design."
2,BE AWARE BEFORE BUYING,"Be aware, this reader, although it works, it will NOT read HDSD cards, it is ONLY able to read the OLDER SD cards (ie - those smaller than 4gig)I goofed, and did not read closely enough - and now have reader that will not work with the cards I need to use it with. Mea culpa, but hopefully this review will keep folks from buying this reader thinking it will read the modern, larger HDSD cardsBottom line, this is obsolete technology. Get something like the BlueProton or any other card reader that IS compatable with the newer standardJohn"
2,what happened????,"I had one before and I thought it was the shisnk; however, this one is not good at all. someone tell me why this one is harder to use."
5,Completely Satisfied,"This device feels like a plastic toy, but it works very well with my XD-Picture cards, which most multi-card readers can't handle. A three foot usb cable is included. Getting the card in and out of the slot wasn't difficult after the first few times. The potentially loose cover isn't an issue with me because I leave the reader plugged into my desktop computer with the usb cable."
1,Tacky,"This item works fairly well for its intended purpose. I returned it for two reasons: first, the flip-open access panel is made of such thin and wobbly plastic that it is fairly certain to malfunction; second, the cap won't stay on. Because of its crackerjack-toy quality, it was returned immediately for refund.Transcend P5 9-in-1 USB 2.0 Flash Memory Card Reader TS-RDP5K (Black)CTCstore 10-in-1 USB 2.0 High Speed Memory Card Reader Writer for SD SDHC MiniSD MiniSDHC MMC rsMMC - Purple"
2,You get what you paid for!,"Yes, I got this memory card reader because it was the cheapest and because I thought it would do the job for me. Right away I noticed that it looks cheap, I can't close it with the memory card inside, and now, just after a few uses does not work at all.I don't recommend this product. Spend a little more and get something worth your money."
4,Long-time user,"I have had one of these for two or three years and love it. Yes, I lost the cap fairly soon after getting it, but it's never been a problem. I don't travel with it often, and when I do I put it in Zip-Loc bag.It saves me from having to connect my cameras to the computer to download photos and from having to connect my digital photo frame to load photos for display. I also used it as a data-trasfer device because my SD cards hold more than any of my flash drives.It has proven to be durable, and inserting and removing the cards is not an issue at all. For the money, you can't beat it."
4,Seems to work,A little tricky to get it to work at first but otherwise seems to be fine. I definitely needed the adapter that came with my disk.
4,worth buying,i bought this last year n m still using it to read my microSD n i must tell that it gives great results. Never let me down n its a product worth buying
2,Don't buy the generic one,"I have bought several of these. Some came in a fancy blister, and others in a coushing bag. Stay away from those. Be sure you're buying the sealed one because the physical design is a lot different.I give the generic two stars just because it works. I give four stars to the original because as others reviewers have said it's a little difficult to remove the card."
1,"Ours broke, right out of the box.","My ex wasn't even able to use this once. It was misaligned & didn't work right. It wouldn't make the clicking sound. It was manufactured wrong, so we just threw it out. Useless. It's a shame too. The other reviews seemed so good & she could have really beneffi..."
4,Wish it was softer,"Have only had the product a short period of time, but the video was helpful in instructing what I am suppose to be doing and what I will achieve with regular use.My only complaint would be the hard plastic construction, it seems that some softer material could have been used instead of or on top of the existing unit."
2,Not what it seems to be,The instructional DVD doesn't explain the instrument well and the whole instrument is very cheaply put together. For the money I expected something much better.
4,Dura pero buena,El autor hace un dibujo muy convincente de un Ayacucho donde los recuerdos de Sendero Luminosoaún están muy vividos. Los personajes son fascinantes y la trama agarra al lector. La historia esdura (sobretodo el fin) pero buena. Merece ser leido.
3,"Buena historia, pero...","Buena historia, pero... Santiago Roncagliolo intenta hacer de esta obra, una obra maestra. Historia, novela histórica, política, crímenes seriales, todos los condimentos están allí, pero al final no me convenció. Es un buen libro, seguro una próxima obra del autor será mucho mejor."
5,All you want to see in Chinese Art,"The National Museum of Art in Taipei is the repository of the finest Chinese art in the world. Taken out of China by the Nationalists, the art was fortunate to be out of the hands of the Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution, when most of the important art on the maniland was destroyed or defaced.For people wanting to see the great forms of Chinese art, this book is almost as good as going to Taiwan.No wonder the chinese want the island back - olny for the art."
3,"Addtional reading for specialists, I think.",For somebody particularly interested in usually unpublished texts of known writers this can be of much interest. Having read much of his writings the mentioned text was rather interesting to me. It might have a small readership otherwise.
5,Inexpensive fix for a common problem,"Replace an existing peephole viewer in my condo door. Fit perfectly and greatly improves the view. Note that if you have a door knocker that fits over the peephole, this does protrude a bit more than a conventional viewer; so the door knocker will not hit the door in the same way and will now sound as loud."
5,perfect,"gives is plenty of angle to see outside... I used a 1/2"" drill bit to drill through my metal door, the viewer is made of two pieces that screw together... I suggest you use silicone to make a good seal."
5,"Good quality, easy to install","I've wanted one of these for years, took me about 2 mins to install and works great. Should have looked years ago..."
5,Great,"Works well. Clear vision through peephole, almost. Just a little aberrations (like Coke bottle rings) around the edges. The field of vision is as described. It would be difficult for someone to hide near the peephole."
2,Don't get it wet,Great product - clear view - except when I washed my door w/ wtr hose. Lens fogged up and didn't clear up.
4,Very clear. One caveat.,"As others have stated, the inside of the door chipped just a bit. Barely noticeable. While the front of the viewer had a large trim ring to cover chips, the inside part did not.Suggest you buy some type of inside trim ring, maybe just a nice washer.The viewer is very clear, and much better than other viewers I have used.One star deduction for the lack of a larger inside trim ring."
1,Crappy piece of junk - foggy lens 2X,"So I am not sure if I got sent the right item or not - but the view finders I got are terrible. Overnight they became foggy and never to clear up. The barely made it through the door here, but the following day you couldn't see through it. I removed it and sure enough there was water in the lens, two days inside and it dried. I am returning these and replacing with the much higher price Baldwin brand."
2,Not a good deal,"Not amazing, at all. Spent one hour working on it. Instead of taking away any scratches on my ipod, it caused new ones actually. Do not waste your money, deal with the fact the ipod has some scratches and save the bucks for a brand new one."
5,An excellent reference source for owners of BMW Motorcycles,"This book documents the production of all BMW motorcycles from the very beginning up until 1997. It has high quality pictures of most BMW models as well as rating the various models as to desirability of ownership from a collector's point of view.The author is obviously an expert in this area and offers insightful comments. There are quite a few sidebars that detail his riding experiences on various older modelsThis book is a ""must have"" for any serious BMW motorcycle enthusiast or owner."
4,Basic - Well Written - Not specific to any GIS software,"This book is very basic, but it was intended to be. It is very well written and well organized. I'd recommend it as an intro. Even tho it is an ESRI book, it does not give specific instructions on how to do any tasks using ESRI products... also by design."
2,Definitely not an Introduction to GIS,"As a newcomer to GIS I was very disappointed with this book. It is purported to ""be invaluable reading for the people encountering GIS for the first time"". I'm afraid it is nothing of the sort. Doubtless, the author is very skilled and knowledgeable but I wonder about his target readership. It surely cannot be the uninitiated in GIS. If it is to be of any use to the beginner, Chapter 1 needs to be completely revised. The feature dense graphics at the start are off-putting. At the outset, simple graphics are needed to illustrate the concepts. The linkages between Map and Table are not explained in a user friendly way. I have been involved in the production of training material for 35 years. My motto has always been: Keep it simple at the start. Come on ESRI, you can do better than that.Daniel Courtney [Ph.D Student]"
5,Reyita,"I could not put the book down. It is worth learning about hardships, deprivations, lack of respect for citizens of African Cubans. This is something people should read, it makes you think about your own well being as a person. God bless Reyita. She was a strong individual. Only the strong survive. Great book."
5,one of the founding American novels,"Once you read Douglass's narrative, you will be surprised that Douglass learned enough to be able to write the first narrative written by an uneducated slave. This is one of the most moving narratives you can read -- I challenge any reader to read this and not understand the irony of the white people supressing black people's accomplishments for hundreds of years. The story of Fredrick Douglas in inspiring on many different levels. Once you read it, any reader will understand why this is mandatory reading in any American literature course. It is impossible to understand life after the Civil War without reading this moving, touching novel about how a slave learned how to read and write. Douglass's autobiography is a great literary achievement which should be savored by all who read it both as a historical and literary document."
1,Save your money,"Well, it's a bit of a pain to get the fittings installed. Cheap plastic locking rings, one broke immediately. I'm not impressed. save your money and skip this."
4,definitely not the movie version,"How do 120 men, many of them sick and injured, and few of them infantry, manage to do what 10 times as many died trying earlier? Read the book and find out. One of the great defenses at all time. If you've seen the movie, you can see why the Welsh, and the English more vicariously, regard this action as one of the greatest moments in the history of the British army. And well they should. How would Americans feel if Crockett, Travis and Bowie not only survived the Alamo but won? There's little of the mythology of the battle in this book written by a present day Colonel of the same regiment. You won't find the Welsh and the Zulu serenading each other as you did in the movie, but as in the movie, you will find a great deal of mutual respect for the bravery and skill of both sides. And you'll learn why the names of Bromhead, Chard and Hook, among others, remain as well known in Britain today as Crockett and Bowie do here"
4,Please note...,"This expensive book is the first edition of Habito's work. A new, revised, and less expensive edition can be obtained in Habito's Living Zen, Loving God."
3,Not the best western,"Well, I bought this hoping for a performance like the one in ""For A Few Dollars More"", but didn't get it. At times this movie is silly, when you are expecting it to be something better. I won't be buying any of the other Sabata movies, as this was supposed to be the best one. I was disappointed."
4,ANOTHER GOOD 'SPAGHETTI' WESTERN,"Thanks to Lee Van Cleef this is another good spaghetti western. Mostly it is tongue-in-cheek type humor but there is never any doubt how the ""nameless"" one will come out ahead.Nick Jordan as the acrobtic Indian and William Berger as Banjo are welcome additions, as well as ""Pedro Sanchez""s role as the drunk who fought at Richmond.Good laughs, straight shooting, and a somewhat twist of an ending, ensure most viewers will at least give this one a 3 star rating.Let-em-roll, pardners."
3,Inadvertently Bergmans Bio,"I was a little dissapointed in this book by the fact that the authors, Philip and Kersti French told the story of the film, then discussed it, then the background of the film. The discussions about the film were minute compared to the rest. The background of the film focused majorly on Bergmans life and what was going on at the time of production that may have inspired his work, yet I dont see why one would not want to just go out and read Bergmans own biography. I loved Bergmans film, which is what interested me here, and it excited me to read about it, but the material was dry and uninteresting. There were some good insights to the workings of Bergman, but nothing to change the way you understand the film entirely."
3,Reminds me of when I had a pet gerbil...,"I have really enjoyed everything I have heard by Steve Roach...up until now. The scritchy-clicky noises in this one remind me of trying to sleep while a pet gerbil is chewing on things in my bedroom late at night. Perhaps I have been spoiled by such brilliant gems as ""Midnight Moon,"" ""The Magnificent Void,"" ""Quiet Music,"" or Roach's collaborations with Robert Rich. All of those recordings have gotten a great deal of airplay in my home late at night. I also enjoy ""Early Man"" and ""Australia: Sound of the Earth"" with David Hudson and Sarah Hopkins much more than this recording. Perhaps it will grow on me, but I like those others so much more, I doubt this one will get played much. I don't exactly dislike this recording, but it doesn't come close to my favorites."
2,Disappointing entry,"Being a big Roach fan, and enjoying almost everything he has ever created, I found ""On This Planet"" to be his most disappointing so far. It is the first CD he has ever put out that does absolutely nothing for me. I get the feeling that he might have put this one together in a hurry and wasn't into it 100%."
5,Best comedy series of all time.,"Sledge Hammer is arguably the funniest comedy detective series of all time. It's a tongue-in-cheek sendup of the Dirty Harry movies. Seldom hits a wrong note, everything that can be parodied, is. David Rasche is perfect as the off-the-wall detective who talks to his gun. If you haven't seen it, get it now."
5,"""Trust me, I know what I'm doing""","I am SOOOOOO happy this is on dvd. I hadn't seen the show since I was [...] years old back when it was on the air, andI still remmeber it. It was great. I especially liked the episode where they were trapped in the bank during a robbery, and he had only one bullet so he kept trying find oppertunities where the robbers would line up so he could get them both woth his only bullet.Brilliant!...now if only i can find me a copy of streethawk....."
5,sledge hammer returns in a big way,"I have been eagerly anticipating the return of Officer Sledge Hammer for a number of years. This DVD collection did not disappoint. While Sledge Hammer features some of the most irreverent humor to hit the small screen, it was masterfully written and directed. Offering up some of the earliest parodies of the biggest action movies of the '80's, Sledge Hammer poked fondly at some now very noticeable stereotypes, such as the boss who yells constantly, the trigger happy cop, the Godfather, etc.This is one of the funniest series currently out on DVD. I am eagerly awaiting the second season. Kudos to Alan Spencer for bringing this out of the vault."
5,Violence...It's not just for breakfast any more!!!,"It's been years but it's still funny. I'd forgotten the little things... target practice in his appartment, a little violence good, alot of violence great, and Dori's legs...nice. 4 DVD's, very nice packaging, funny side comentary, and no laugh track. What more could you ask for?"
5,"Trust him, he knows what he's doing!","As a 15 year old stuck at home on Friday night, while my sister watched Miami Vice on the big TV, I watched ""Sledge Hammer!"" in the upstairs den. Seeing ads in People Magazine and on ABC, I started watching the show from the very beginning and was hooked.Anchor Bay has done a wonderful job with the Season 1 DVD release. As soon as I got the DVD, I watched all 534 minutes of it, then re-watched the 4 episodes that had audio commentary. The picture looks great, and the show is as funny as I remember it. Who needs a laugh track? I was providing my own.I look forward to the release of Season 2. Some of those shows I missed when they first aired, being 16 with a drivers license!Hey Alan Spencer, how about a ""Sledge Hammer!"" motion picture. I bet David Rashe, Harrison Page, and Anne-Marie Martin would be game!"
3,Should Have Stayed True To The Show As It Was Seen On TV,"This show had a laugh track when it was on the air. Alan Spencer believes that a laugh track insults the viewers intelligence or something.For me the laugh track was a part of the personality of this show. It added to the overall goofiness. Not even having it available as an option on the DVD was, I think, a mistake."
1,This is pure garbage without the laugh track,"This is one of those shows that needs the laugh track or else it appears to be too dry. And what is with that commentary by that arrogant director, it does not make it an more of a pleasant experience and why does he keep bashing Mr. Belvedere? Now that is a show I am waiting for on DVD, with the laugh track please. If you really want to relive this series, get it from the library where you will not have to pay for it."
5,Cancelled too early,"This was one of the greatest comedy shows. It didn't pull any punches, and provided endless laughs the whole family could enjoy. Highly recommended."
5,Part I of Sledge Hammer,I had bought the whole set. I saw the entire program on the tv. I saw I have to have it when it comes out. Well it did and I bought it about 1 am in the moring. He is the bestest of the best of the all the Cops there is alive or dead. He is my favorte Guy there is. harold.
1,Totally Useless,"Why would you offer up a category that ""is not available"". It took quite some time to get here, only to receive the message ""all products listed are no longer available."" Sorry, but I'm seriously disappointed."
1,Conservative Slander,"This book's title is very misleading; rather an in depth look at what it means to be conservative or liberal it is a tasteless attack on anything thats not a far-right extreme, though the author refers to his type of brain-less conservatism as ""juris naturalis"" and other stupid psuedonyms."
3,interesting,"I learned alot on the different parties. It was pretty much to the point, which is what I like. Would eventually like to read the rest of the series."
4,"1 good, 1 OK, and 2 Ugly","Picasso at the Lapin Agile is a wonderful play, with a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humor, dry wit, and intelligent riddles. In this play, Martin has set out a very amusing treatise on some very important aspects of the 20th century, especially regarding art and science.There are, however, three other plays in this collection. Two of them, Zig-Zag Woman and Patter for a Floating Lady, can hardly be called plays. They're not even one-acts. They have the appearance of just being filler that Martin wrote to pass the time. Wasp, the fourth play in the collection, has many high points, including an hilarious monologue the father delivers to the son. It contains enough dark humor and sarcasm to make it a good read.Picasso at the Lapin Agile alone is worth buying this collection, but don't expect the other plays to live up to Picasso's status. It is, though, a good collection for anyone interested in this type of humor or drama."
5,An extremely funny take on serious stuff,"Steve Martin has always been a ""serious"" writer, in that he is interested in using humor to make people think and to highlight ideas in new ways. ""Picasso at the LapinAgile"" is a delightful piece of theatrical slight of hand wherein he creates the meeting of the century that never happened between the most influential scientest and the most influential artist and, after a wonderful setup, does a quantum leap into the absurd. It's fun to read and on stage (I saw the production at Ford's Theater in D.C.) it is fantastic.Recently on a trip to Paris I climed Montmarte Butte to find the site of the Lapin Agile, the bistro in which Martin's play is set. It is still there and still in business, but alas, never saw nor will see a coming together of intelligence, talent and ego such as that envisioned by Steve Martin in this play.This is very smart comedy but funny enough in other ways to work for most audiences. I highly recommend it."
2,disappointing,"I saw the ""Picasso"" play in Laguna Beach, and was disappointed. I'm a Steve Martin fan, and a fan of the theater. But, frankly, this seemed like a play that was written by a TV gag man (Martin wrote the old ""Smothers Brothers"" show.) It was very very two-dimensional, considering its intellectual pretentions. Frankly, I think Martin is a first rate comedic actor, and stand-up comedy writer and performer. But the only screenplay he wrote that was good was ROXANNE, and that was good because he just updated--and did a twist on--""Cyrano De Bergerac."" He is NOT good at long narrative fiction. He's good--often brilliant-- at small bytes (which is why PURE DRIVEL is good). He should stick to what he does best."
5,Clever and surprisingly gentle...,"Steve Martin is not exactly known for the subtlety of his humor. With ""Picasso at the Lapin Agile"", the comedy is not physical or over the top, but subtle and often heart warming. It is an interesting look at invention and vision. I rarely laughed out loud when reading these scripts because of the obvious lack of comic timing involved in reading, but I smiled often, almost constantly while reading. These plays all deal with the future or bizarre onstage visuals, not to mention deeper issues like relationships. I'd really love to see ""Picasso..."" live...The book was great, but I'm willing to bet that a performance would be amazing."
4,Picasso at the Lapin Agile,"Very interesting treatment of Picasso, Einstein, and ""the man on the street"". Amusing dialogue illustrates views on each particular discipline (science and art) and inserts a spirituality to Einstein's character. Interesting that Picasso's dialogue doesn't seem to be as spiritual - but more carnal. And later in the play - to insert the surprise character of Elvis (unidentified) - and that character's insightful views - and bounce them off the artist's and scientist's conversations.Didn't enjoy the Zig Zag Woman as much. Need to read it again. I'm certain I missed something.Didn't know Steve Martin had such depth!!"
5,Brilliant Comedy/Drama,"This was one of those things that made me realize that Steve Martin is not just a comedian... Granted, the title play is for the most part a comedy, and some of the other plays are like throwbacks to Cruel Shoes, there are some really deep thoughts and some really touching moments. Patter for the Floating Lady is a real and heartwrenching story of relationships, and Picasso is insight into how we see the world, and the Yin and Yang of science and art. I love anything that reveals to people that art and science are not diametrically opposed."
3,Past Difiicult Stage,"Bought this puzzle as I am a puzzle nut. I don't like easy puzzles, I do like a challenge. However it took me several months to finish this one as all the pieces are the same. Usually a 1000 piece puzzle takes me a week, working on it for maybe an hour at a time. This one was a bear to work on and had me feeling that maybe I shouldn't make puzzles any more. This was not relaxing and definitely was not enjoyable. Do not recommend to anyone."
4,not so pirate,"I ordered this puzzle because I thought I would get a pirate ship and scenery depicting pirate life in some way. Instead there is a ship but no cross bones, no treasure, no pirates and no canons. More dolphins and fish under the water than I wanted to see. After all with a title like Pirates Paradise one thinks of buried treasure found on a deserted island or a big mighty ship with cross bones or a parrot on the shoulder of the happiest pirate yet....oh well. I will keep looking for that neat pirate look..."
3,"interesting read, but not a ""biography""","This is a fiction novel, not strictly speaking a biography. I was expecting non-fiction based biography, based on various religious and folk texts from numerous different cultures and times.This novel uses a number of historical/religious texts and stories to create a mix of science fiction and philosophy. It is a story of Lucifer as he goes through aeons of time, placing him in several historical places and events. Lucifer is not presented as a god-like creature with unlimitted power, but rather a flawed creature, whose powers are very much human.It is very well written and most certainly presents a different story of Lucifer, from most of us are accustomed to. For anyone looking for a good interesting intelectual read, try it. Anyone expecting a biography of Lucifer, from a historical or religious perspective, skip it."
4,Obligatory for youth,"The value of this book is not only in photos, but maybe mainly in description of history that is behind the photo.I think this book should be in every family house, especially with children."
5,Superb Short Stories,"One of the best collections of Western short stories I've read. LeMay is the author of book that was made into the John Wayne classic movie ""The Searchers"" (which is considered by some to be the best Western ever made). Extremely well written. The characters are fascinating and you regret that the stories end so soon. The amazing thing is that most were written during the '20s."
2,bars not so fresh,the bars received were stiff and hard.. maybe dried out or something great taste but not worth breaking a tooth or losing a filling over.
5,A taste of Australia,"I took one bite of my first try of this flavor and boy did it take me back! If there is a taste that defines Australia for me the apricot and coconut is it! Runner up would have to be Vegemite. These are GOOD! And I love that they are truly natural and organic. With all the artificial gook that goes into most produced foods, it's nice to find something pure and trustworthy. Order a case and enjoy!"
5,Good and chewy,This is what I grab at night when I need a treat or when I'm on the run. It is about as good as it gets in flavor and wholesome ingredients.I would recommend this to all vegetarian and vegans.
2,Hard to Chew!!,Good combo of flavors but the bars are hard to chew and do not break into smaller pieces while on the go.
3,"Pretty good, I think","I have used this book quite a bit, and do find it useful, although I find ""The Big Book of Presentation Games"" better for my purposes. I think the ice-breaker ideas are good, especially the bingo game, which I've used a couple times with success. I also think some of the problem-solving ideas are good."
2,This book isn't that great.,This book isn't that great. There are VERY few ideas in this book that I would use. I wouldn't recommend buying this book.
3,Chaotic paranormal thriller entertains and surprises.,"J.N. Williamson was a whirling dervish of literary out put in the late seventies and early eighties. With this thriller, another in a non connected series featuring a Basil Rathbone look alike parapsychology teacher, a young boy with telekinetic powers and multiple evil personalities may grow up to be the Anti-Christ itself! Talk about your plots!The one scene that stands out the most in my memory is the dinner table assault scene. The boy feeds off his mother's irritation at how her husband always pronounces ketchup as ""cats-up"", next thing you know the condiment bottle is levitating and chasing the terrified dad around the dinner table. Pretty wild stuff that. Not exactly horrifying, but it isn't boring either. Recommended."
2,Do you like static?,Well....... that's what you will get with this phone system. It's WAY too noisy!
3,Don't wear well,"These are truly adorable as pictured. With nice soft soles, my son can run in them really well (they're not klunky like other kids' sneakers). However, after two days, they looked like they were a year old. All the color wore off to plain leather in the toe area, leaving us with not so cute, expensive shoes that now look like third generation hand-me-downs."
2,"Little insight, little research","The author's main source for this book are the production notes from the film, when it was photographed in 1957. And it shows. There are few interviews, few insights on the filmmaking/creative process. If you're looking for something like a travel guide of San Francisco and a dry account of the number of takes Hitchcock printed for each scene, then you'll be satisfied with the book. If you're curious about why Hitchcock or Jimmy Stewart make the decisions they do, and their opinions on their own work, you'll find little of that here. I loved the film--it's one of my favorites, but I was very disappointed in this book. Better to read Hitchcock by Truffaut for an inside look at filmmaking with Hitchcock..."
2,More trivia than insight,"I wavered between two and three stars for my rating, finally settling on two on the basis that I'm certain I will never open this book again to re-read it.First a note about the Kindle formatting: It is very poor. When someone is quoted, there is no format change of any kind to let you know you're leaving third person narrative and entering a quote. The very title of the movie was sometimes shown as ""Vertigo"", and other times inexplicably as ""1krtigo"".As for the book itself, there was too much trivia regarding how many takes Hitchcock took on various scenes. I picked up a few interesting facts about the movie; but not enough to justify reading the book."
4,Trivia abounds,"Great reference book, but I did get bogged down on all the technical information/processes of the films restoration. Otherwise it's very interesting and enjoyable."
2,Fact-filled but dull account.,"Fact-filled but dull account of the creation, and rebirth, of this absorbing, extraordinary film. Ubiquitous film maven Martin Scorsese provides yet another say-nothing foreword. Nice selection of photos, though."
5,Great product for acne prone skin,"I have very acne prone skin. This product doesn't cause any problems. It is smooth to glide on, moisturizing but not greasy."
5,Great,"This toy is so much fun. It is kind of hard to pull back the band to release it, so it would not be recommended for smaller childred, 7 and up only. It is really fun toy!!!"
3,Its an air gun...,"Its exactly what it looks like, an air gun that makes a great gift for my nephews... Will blow out a candle at 10 feet, knock over a cup at 5."
4,Average fun if you can put it together,If this came in one piece and ready to play right out of the box it would have been a bigger hit. I bought two of them. The first one got the cord twisted while putting it together and it barely works. I am not sure if they were able to take it apart and fix it or not. The second one finally got put together and it works. What a great toy to annoy your sister with!!!
2,You get what you pay for,"Assembly was a problem. Parts did not allign well and after a few uses the hoop came loose that holds the bag. I could not get it to stay after that and resorted to good old duct tape to hold it on. But it was only 14.95. I think the charge for shipping was almost as much. So it is a pretty cheap one. Maybe one of the other models works better. These thing are pretty cool, when they stay together."
2,Not worth the money,"I've heard about this ""airzooka"" ever since they first came out with them and always thought it would be a fun thing for boys to play with, so I bought 2 of these for my 11 year old son and 6 year old grandson for Christmas. First problem was that my sons box didn't come with any screws to hold it together which caused us great grief on Christmas morning. The next problem was that it wasn't as fun to the kids as the company makes them look. The 6 year old had a really hard time pulling the the thing out far enough to shoot the air sufficiently, so he had a fit. When our 11 year old tried the one that DID come with the screws, he wasn't all that impressed after the first initial bursts of air at his sister.Honestly, I think personally they are a big waste of time and money, not to mention the fact that I have contacted the seller twice to get the missing screws and we still haven't heard back."
1,Total Garbage,"Almost impossible to put together... The ""ring"" that holds the plastic bag fell off during assembly- even with the help of additional people could not get it back on. The ""holes"" on top don't line up even though the bottom assembly is in place so no way to fix that.The plastic ""grip"" is so flimsy I could never trust using this thing- the force required to pull the bag back enough to be fun could easily rip this out of the hand of a child or young adult. As a 6'4"" full grown man I had a hard time holding onto it, and of course the bag falls off since that ring won't go back on.A dangerous joke. Avoid at all costs."
4,"Surprisingly Fun, Bigger Than Expected - Recommended","The Airzooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20' or so. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit! The Airzooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own, but he was eventually able to get it.Everyone (young and old) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up (Note: No animals were harmed in the writing of this review :-)Recommended!"
3,Fun but...,"Airzooka - this can be a fun toy. We had a great time with it until about the 4th time we used it and the plastic lining ripped. Once the lining rips, thats it, the gun doesn't work anymore. I was able to make some repairs using packing tape, and it is working again, but for how long? If you buy this toy, be gentle with it."
2,"Fun toy, poorly made",I had great fun with this toy playing at a store I spotted it in. The problem is the toy is poorly designed and will fail over time. There are 2 main problems.1. The rim at the back of the airzooka which holds the plastic cover in place is poorly designed. It has very shallow groves which hold it in place. If you drop it the rim will pop out from its moorings and the plastic will potentially come undone.2. The plastic backing is poorly made because it is stitched back on itself. This creates tiny perforations which will get bigger over time. My airzooka had gaping holes the size of a thumbnail in two spots after 20 'shots. Once the perforations enlarge the airzooka simply fails to shoot a significant amount of air.
3,Watch your colors,"I ordered two AirZooka's, a blue one and a yellow one. The yellow one seems to be made out of a flimsier plastic than the blue one. The yellow one even arrived with a 1/2-3/4 inch crack and hole in the business end. I'm not even bothering trying to get it repaired. I'm just suggesting the yellow version is made of a lighter-weight plastic, and is more likely to incur damage.The AirZooka, as pointed out elsewhere, is almost as powerful as the more-expensive MegaZooka, and the AirZooka is easier to fire rapidly.WhitIV"
4,Entertaining Fun,I actually bought this because I thought my dad's dog would enjoy playing with the airballs. Wrong. The over-grown puppy with too much energy will actally kennel herself if she sees it in your hand. Not the result that I was going for but highly entertaining all the same. Us humans enjoy it much more than the dog does :-)
4,fun gun,Product was great. Should have an over 10 age rating. Too difficult for younger kids to use. (Arm strength) Seller great.AirZooka - Black
1,Fun the first time and then.....,"This toy is a total waste of money, I should know, I bought two of them. They are really hard for even an adult to use and just not that exciting, in my opinion"
2,Very Large and Hard to Put Together,"This toy is much larger than I expected and is somewhat of a pain to store. It was very difficult to put together even with three of us reading the directions...the pieces didn't fit into each other as easily as I thought they should. Once it was put together though, everyone enjoyed playing with it. But now it's sitting on a shelf in the basement."
3,Fun to play with but pieces broke off the first day,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. He really enjoys playing with it, but the sight on top immediately broke off within a few minutes. My husband tried fixing it and hurt his hand on the sharp edges. Finnaly we glued it but that did not hold either. The gun is still operable and still fun for my son."
4,Awesome,"Had some of these when I was in high school, they were just as much fun as I remembered. The whole family can participate, but the strings are kind of hard to pull so it was harder for the little ones to play but the teenagers and adults had a great time."
1,Poor Quality,The product is below avarage in quality. I was expecting something much more powerful. It makes more noise than fun when you use it.
5,Good product!,"The vehicle charger is terrific. It is very tough, and plugs into the Treo easily ------ also, unlike older Treo chargers, it never disconnets easily from the Treo, once placed it also charges quickly and the price is cheap - you can't go wrong on this one."
4,This ain't Pac yall,"listen to this mug, it aint pac for sure. its kinda tight but it aint pac. i think pac is alive but that aint him. this dude is pretty raw but he aint quite pac. play on yall, CG"
5,I was impressed to hear it!,"I heard Blac Haze on a Tupac website and was like WOW! Beisdes the fact that he sounds like Tupac, Let Me Holla at cha has a great beat. If you like hip hop or rap, you must buy this one."
2,Hardly the best,"Shouler's system has more holes than substance. Here's just one: Babe Ruth, John Montgomery Ward (165 wins, 2.10 ERA, 540 steals, over 2000 hits), Cy Seymour and others who were both pitchers and position players are rated ONLY for their pitching OR their hitting ! This is comparable to rating a pitcher such as Dennis Eckersly only as a reliever, or only as a starter !"
2,not really,"Product arrived before estimated delivery date. Product arrived in excellent condition CD ok most songs average poppy no real meaning. Not really a Patti Fan but was asked to listen, Not impressed. However I would use the company again and recommend it to others"
1,"Free love, at arm's length","I was intrigued by the book's title as I had personal experience with group marriage and communal living, back in the day. The book was disappointing though. The writing wasn't great, but that would have been OK if the content was better. I found the author surprisingly unsympathetic, in spite of the book being her own story. She really never wanted to be where she was and only dabbled in the experiences described. A few months in the '70s... could be enough to influence your direction in life, but hardly gets your feet wet. What was going on in the group sounds fairly typical of the open-ended communal households of that era, but calling it group marriage seems a misnomer; it was your basic free love ideology, without commitment. It would have been more interesting to get some depth of background, people, character, beliefs, but the narrative doesn't really take you beyond the author's own ambivalent feelings."
2,stupid and ignorant,"Alana Clayton doesn't know much about the regency, she thinks the Prince Regent was involved in politics, that the home office investigated crimes, that prostitutes required job training to find jobs (more likely they required references.) She also seems to think that her characters have read the last chapter, how else explain why everyone involved expects that a romance between a married woman and a man not her husband will work out, except by assuming that the characters know in advance that the husband will be killed. Then there are the two main characters. He falls in love with her immediately, Lord knows why, probably because she is rude, suspicious, and churlish in her every dealing with him. And, oh yes, a plot that relies on the principal protagonists deliberately witholding information from one another for no reason simply will not fadge."
5,PERFECT nude lip gloss!,"This is by far the BEST nude lip gloss! I am a darker skinned girl (NC 45 in MAC) with full lips. This is ""See Thru"" but it is a little opaque which is perfect for me. When you first recieve it and put it on it feels like fluffy? lol I would allow this 10 seconds in the some kind of heat and 10 minutes in the fridge. You will get the perfect consistency.Love love looove this lip gloss!"
4,Different leadership styles are required for different stages of team development,"""The One Minute Manager builds high performing teams"" is an excellent book that simply explains through examples the four stages that teams go through and that a different leadership style is required in each; namely Orientation, Dissatisfaction, Integration and Production.For each stage, it is clearly articulated what the Characteristics are, what the Needs of the team are, what the Issues are that need to be addressed and what type of leadership style is appropriate.It is a very quick and easy read, written as a conversation, and I found it very easy to relate to when I looked at various projects I had been involved with. I will be re-reading this again."
2,"excelent book, if it was free","This book contains very little of information, but will get the begineer off to a good start. All of the technics and terms are presented in a very easy to understand manner. However, by searching the internet for ""blackjack strategy"" or something similar to that, you'll find many free sites with very similar stuff withing 10 minutes."
3,Looks Very Worn,"The shirt did not hold up well in the wash. It looked very worn after only a few washes (no drying). Also, it is very big compared to many of her other shirts."
5,Heavy is almost an understatment for Tectonics,"I thought I heard it all for metallic heaviness, though I was so wrong. P.H.O.B.O.S. is this disgustingly underrated & unkown industiral doom/drone band from France. It's a one man band and formed back in 2000, so the band isn't that old. Tectonics was released back in '05, and sadly wasn't noticed, since music like this would be loved by thousands of individuals who love legitimate industrial metal. P.H.O.B.O.S. is right up there with Godflesh, early Jesu, Halo (another very underrated and very heavy industrial metal band), and early Swans. Tectonics is eight tracks long and clocks about an hour, so you get more then pleanty ""tectonic-like"" industrial metal. Also there is alot of doom & drone influence in the music, hence the early Jesu comparison, which is one of the heaviest subgenres of metal. If you really do love your real industrial metal and flat out heavy music, Tectonics must be checked out."
1,Never got it..,I never got it. When i contacted the vendor they say they have delivered. sucks big time....
4,TRUE GUN REVIEW,"things included: grip, red cross sight, light, surpresser, laser, magazine, The gun itslelf, and I believe some bbs.grip: great, but plastic. You might think plastic is fine, but from my own experiances, it can break. overall 4/5red cross sight: cheap sight won't really help. 2/5light: LED light. 'click' button. 5/5surpresser: fake, big; easy to put on/take off 4.5/5laser: works for some time. straight up laser. 4.5/5magazine: about 60 rounds, it could hold more... 3.5/5the gun: shoots about 40-60 feet with full charge and hop up on. hop up doesn't actually much. you dont need to aim down sights. in my opoinion, it is a close quaters gun. great and also lightweight. foldable stock. good for people who are looking for: a mess around gun, a beginner gun, a cheap but very nice gun 4.25/5"
1,this guns sucks,"this gun sucks, i had this gun for like 4 hours and it broke. i pluged it in to charge it for 4 hours shot about 300 bbs through it and it broke. the cocking meganism wouldnt work."
5,Wonderful series,"I love this show! The characters are all very ""real"" and believable, and Ray Romano's humor shows through brilliantly. Definitely hope for many seasons to come!"
2,Men of a certain age (complete season one),"First of all, this review does not apply to the show. this is a WONDERFUL series that touches on life issues for those of us who are 50 years of age or older. Ray Romano is fabulous as are Scott Bakula & Andre Braugher. Five stars for the series, however, two stars for the release.First off, the labels on the two discs are reversed,the disc labeled disc 1 is actually disc 2.Where was the source aquired for the video release for Season 1? The video is very distorted, not the quality on DVD releases that we as consumers are used to purchasing...I hate to say it guys this almost looks like a BOOTLEG DVD set, what gives.Maybe someone @ TNT can have a reponse to this and get the picture quality corrected before Season 2 is released on DVD!If the video problem ever gets corrected on Season 1, would someone @ TNT kindly let the fans (and we are many) of the wonderful series know."
1,This is a piece of.........De La Soul rip off.,"What a piece of... These idiots sound like total amature MC's. The production is basic and simplton, basically these fools shouldn't quit there day jobs. How wak can wak get, check out Jurrasic 5."
3,Rules of Softball,"Unfortunately, I got exactly what I ordered and knew in advance that it was going to be less than what I need. It is a 1998 book and I really should look to get one much more current."
4,A story about reluctant lovers,"I look for stories that have a different perspective, so this one caught my attention. Lily is given control over the inheritance that Avery always thought would be his. The control is temporary; Lily has to prove herself capable of managing it, or she will lose it to Avery. The reader is introduced to these two strong-willed people through their correspondence with one another over several years; the story then moves to real-time. I loved the technique; it felt as though I was reading a long-ago diary, and gave me a better feel for the characters' personalities than straight dialog and narrative would have. By the time the story entered the narrative phase, I was ready for the sparks that flew (love-hate) as their passion for each other unfolded. I ached for them both as the book closed. They were such reluctant lovers! I held back on the fifth star rating because the book felt a little short, but I'll still be keeping it because it's different and I like that."
3,A long time ago,"Lily Bede and Avery Thorne are competing for Mill House. Lily ist beautyful and well educated, but her mother was not married to her father. Avery ist very proud to be a Thorne. He want Mill House badly. Unfortunately Lily and Avery fall in love. The romatic story is set in the 19th century.A nice book for a happy holiday. You will love Lily und hope for a happyend."
2,"Not a wallbanger, but.....","...still not an enjoyable read. I picked this book up because the author came highly recommended to me. Perhaps this book isn't a true reflection of her other novels.While the concept of the book was interesting, I was turned off to the protagonist from the start. When the book begins, he is described as a ""scarecrow"". A knobby kneed, skinny, sickly boy whose main ambition in life is to gain possesion of the Mill House and to be perceived as the perfect gentleman. Later he does come back this big robust man, but the picture of a scarecrow was stuck in my mind at that point, and personally, I found him to be a bit prissy, foppish and sulky. I guess in a nutshell, in my opinion, the protagonist just wasn't ""man enough"" to portray the hero. And that killed whatever romance there might have been in this novel."
2,So disappointing .....,"I have enjoyed some of Brockway's other works but this one was hardly worth the time. The characters had potential but it took too long for them to establish a believable connection. Rather than stimulating exchanges, it was just small-minded bickering. I never formed an attachment to the characters. Based on Lily's ""past"" (or rather her mother's past), I could almost understand her outlook towards men and marriage, and her philosophy-- as a suffragist. Only in the end did I start to warm up to her, but by then it was too little to late. Brockway tried to make us believe that Lily Bede had a heart of gold. But her kindness was extended only to women and children but she expressed only disdain for men. I never found Lily Bede to be likable. Buy it if you must, but I suggest skip it and read Bridal Season instead."
3,A draw,"The only thing that redeemed this book were the snippets of letters that the hero an the heroine wrote to each other, and perhaps the epilogue at the end. There was a conflict, yes, but not one that I personally could sympathize with or felt moved from, and after the sweetly funny As You Desire and the darkly intense All Through the Night, this came as somewhat a downer."
5,Story of a dog named Sweetie trying to get his courage.,"The story is about Sweetie learning how to be a watchdog. His fear is if he bit or barked at someone he'd end up at the pound. So he asked Red and Poky,his friends, for advise. They said it is Ok to bark or to bite someone at a time when a robber is here, or, of course when the coyotes come."
5,More than Just Stored Procedures!,"If you write or maintain apps that use SQL Server or train people to do this, this book is a ""must have""! Not just stored procedures, but triggers, user-defined functions, XML and more.Sunderic includes not only ""how"", but ""why and why not"". Several ways to accomplish a given task are described, with pro's and con's for each. It's an INTERESTING book just to browse!"
4,Start Your Carving Business,"You want to carve and sell your carvings. But you don't have any business sense or don't even know what to do. This book is written just for you! The basic theme of the book is ""Yes, you can start your own carving business and here's how to do it."" Expert carvers give testimonies of how they were successful, and they even include some of their failures. The book uses business terms, such as product, promotion and business plan, in such a way that it helps you understand the basics of a carving business. The basic requirements to be successful are carving skill, a products(carvings) unique from other carvers, an understanding of what people want to buy, and the discipline to follow basic business practices. If you just want to carve, maybe you could get someone to help you with the business side. The book asks a lot of questions, and if you can answer most of them with a ""yes,"" go for it!"
4,Great book for any wood carver or sculptor,"This is a great book and about the only one I know that is dedicated to the subject. Whether you carve birds, figurines, animals, fish or just whittle or build things to sell in your shop - this book gives a great inside view on what it's like to then sell your items. I give it 4 stars as it's now outdated with all the advancements with marketing via the internet. We need more books or instruction for beginners and those old hands looking to sell their work for the first time - it's a lot to learn and the more of us doing so successfully will only increase the attention to the artform and make all of us better for it. Looking forward to more on the subject!"
4,Inexpensive Emergency Light,I was pleasently surprised by the high beam and its throw. But using this as an emergency light may be too focused for indoor use. Looks great for checking for downed lines and broken tree branches down the street. This flashlight is replacing a 25 year old 6v lantern that has worn out. This flashlight is 1/2 the size of the old light and will be much easier to keep with me. Especially looking forward to having the low power modes and moonlight mode for those long power outages.
5,Bright and rugged,I have used various lights made by Streamlight over the 20 years I have been in the fire service and they have always performed well. This light performs wells also. It is bright and easy on batteries.
5,Streamlight Survivor,"I'm a volunteer firefighter in a brigade in the NSW Rural Fire Service, Australia and we have purchased 16 of these to replace our current Pelican Sabrelights. The difference between those and these is night and day, especally when used on our CABA sets.The brightness of these is fantastic and they appear to be built tough to take the knocks and bumps of operational use, with long battery life.The fact that they take AA batteries makes them a simple change in the field. I would highly recommend them to any firefighter.Two memebrs of our brigade are full time firefighters with Fire & Rescue NSW and they have purchased them for thier full time use and their colleagues are amazed so much so that they are now purchasing them."
5,Fantastic!! Phil's voice is smooth and range is stunning,"An execellent album for a party, romantic evening or just driving home from work. The new titles are strong and his twist on the remakes is definetly PHIL PERRY!!! Don't miss the oppurtunity to add this to your ""special"" collection."
4,Good buy,"Great tracks that are taken directly from gameplay. Ever track is a good listen, however tracks ~15-20 have an annoying back track that plays straight through each song and gets very repedative. Otherwise i liked it!"
3,Almost makes it,"Maybe a little disorganized, but overall a pretty good reference. Lots of odd omissions though. For instance, the SUBSTR function can take negative number parameters but that is not shown. In the numeric functions, where are the GREATEST and LEAST functions? There is a list of conversion functions but no examples. If you've ever pulled your hair out over a deeply nested DECODE, you know some good examples would be nice. A few of the SQL*Plus SET commands are scattered here and there, but there is no list.Bottom line... not bad but needs more work."
3,Good coverage of concepts but with no exercises for the reader to practice,Oracle Database 10g SQL - Is a good book to read or reference concepts in detail. Author has covered good amount of concepts from basics of SQL to advanced SQL queries. But we were disappointed to find that the book doesn't come with exercises at the end of each chapter to practice and play on the concepts understood.
1,Confusing to beginners experts alike,"I am disappointed with this book because the following reasons:- A good portion of the book is dedicated to teach basic SQL to beginners, yet the examples provided ... leave the reader confused.- The book spends volumes explaining the obvious (obvious even to beginners), yet leave out the important details that enable the reader to fully understand. Many times the book fail to explain the differences between various Oracle functions.- Too little on 10g. Only a few pages on regular expressions search. Very unsatisfactory examples on PL/SQL. ...Overall, I get the feeling that the author does not fully understand the topic he is trying to write on."
4,Good book from scratch to practice,"It is a very good book for both who are beginning to learn SQL from scratch or those who are not too familiar with Oracle SQL databases. It introduces a lot of new 10g functionalities. Examples are given in almost most functions for easy understanding of practical usage. However, the book does not explain enough about the concept of storage about the Oracle 10g."
5,Purchased for the grand kitties for Christmas,I purchased this for my daughters kittens for Christmas. She said that she loves it and her cats are curious about it. The one cat sleeps on it.
1,not good quality,"I've bought scratching posts on line before--this is the first time I bought one that came unassembled, an easy enough thing to do, but once put together, it simply lacked the stability that such an item needs. My little seven pound cat rocked the post when she stretched up to use it, an experience she clearly did not enjoy. (If I had seen that I needed to put it together I would not have purchased it; I don't believe there was any such instruction in the product description). In addition, the carpet fibers pilled out on this almost instantly. I have thrown this one away and gone into a store to purchase a MUCH better made one, taller, firmer, with better carpeting for about the same price. This is the first time in reviewing a purchase that I can honestly say DON'T BUY THIS ITEM. It is not worth it. The vendor however did ship the post in a very timely fashion."
2,Basic book,"This small (size) book is well suited for a 2nd grade class book report. It's about 35 pages long and basic info you can find on a web search. Unless you are a collector and need one of everything, don't bother."
4,WEstern Digital 120 gb Hard drive,The drive arrived in record time. Was happy about that. I installed the drive in my computer and the computer did the rest. Was so easy to install. The drive was a little more noise than my old drive. But it is working perfectly. I rate the drive 4 stars. I would give it 5 stars except for the noise in the drive. I give Amazon 5 stars for their service. G.Stone
5,120 GB Hard Drive,This Hard Drive is super! Have had no problems with it whatsoever. I really am very well pleased with it.
3,what's on it?,It'd be nice if there was a listing of the cartoons so the customer knew what they were getting.
3,Half and half,"Half of these are cute Christmas, half would have been better to have been left out. The sound is also subpar - which makes it hard to really understand. I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter and she enjoyed half and was bored with half -- ""skip this one grandma"".... She has not asked to watch it the last two times she was here. Unless you are really into Vintage cartoons, I'd pass. I know there are much better ""classic Christmas"" cartoons out there."
4,Heartwrenching story of domestic violence.,"This is a very powerful work about domestic violence and the consequences of a life born into hatred and prejudice. It is a story of the dangers of pride and the sometimes inescapable tentacales of family destiny. The author deals with a very dark side of issues we all have - trying not to become our parents. Although the story occurs in Hawaii it is a story repeated everywhere in the world, a point the author clearly observes, and his clarity and simplicity of style make it possible for anyone to connect to his tale. I heartily recommend it."
3,"Nice, but...","Sweet product. The sound is decent and it fits comfortably on my big head. Works very well for speaking on the phone.Two negative things about it: first, you need to make sure you get a bluetooth adapter that supports the A2DP profile or else you won't get stereo sound. Not too many of those out there yet. Second, I get occasional sound dropouts when pumping music from my PC or my PDA. Since it happens with both sources, that sounds like a headphones problem to me. It's intermittent and random, but I can live with it."
3,Does not work on iPhone!! Misleading copy.,"While this is an excellent product, I would caution anyone purchasing this for use on an iPhone as it will not work with the audio, only the phone will work via bluetooth.The copy for this said it would work on ALL phones. It does not."
4,Captain 'Jacqueline' Sparrow,"This was a very cute costume, though to be honest we paired it with a better hat and real boots. My daughter wore it several times, and it's still holding together fine so we tossed it in the dress up bin. Expect it to last well into the year."
3,"good price, needed adjustments","We were glad to find this at such a good price. But on my very petite daughter, i had to take the elastic out and adjust the shoulders. It is about a size 6x. I think the size could vary, based on the quality of the product.. massed produced with no real finishing."
2,These are superficial showoff days too,"Firmly in the Oscar Peterson tradition, Benny Green is so technically gifted, and so Oscarish, that the work of his flying fingers is superficial and flashy, and lacks the depth of truly great music. He is widely hailed for his blues/Silver/Timmons gospel influence, but typically fails to reach the soulfulness that came so naturally to Timmons, Hawes and to Horace. Green's technique is an obstruction as much as a weapon."
2,Redesign,"Having read Ms Keaton's last two books which I thoroughly enjoyed, I could not wait to purchase and read this one. The cover is really nice and the storyline would be as well were it not for so many errors. I evidently must have the unedited edition as the errors I had to read pass, I forced myself to complete the book hoping Hamilton and Shari would hurry and get together. I hope for Ms Keaton's future books, she will find someone to proof her work that will make sure her writing talent shows."
1,Long winded and uneventful...,"to say the least. This book within a book type thing just doesn't interest me. The stories were too long and drawn out, a toddler could've written better stuff. If anything, it just showed me how much the characters just messed around playing mind games, instead of just getting to the point and enjoying the glorious day we call valentine's day. If you want a passionate love story, don't waste your cash on this on, get A Taste of Love by Loure Bussey, now she's an author I can guarantee all romance readers will love!"
5,It's my favorite party disc. These guys rock...,"I've seen the Nerds in NYC, and even cought their Carnegie Hall show. They never cease to blow me away. The originals are great, and the covers are a scream. This is a must have."
5,"the good spell book: love charms, magical cures, and other practical sorcery","it's a nice book, and u wont get bored reading it...u would even repeat reading the book."
2,I think most of it is made up.,The author does not have a clue what real spell casting is. I think the author read a few books and decided to cash in by writing made up spells and charms. Sorcery takes a lot more then lighting a candle and saying a few cute words. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
1,Not a spell book,"This book has many spells that are manipulative. I am a Magician, I have studied magick and am involved in magick. I read theses spell and knew that they were a joke, if you want real magic study something with an earth base. This is book has no real value and should not be sold, don't waste your money on this."
1,cheap,book contains gypsy magic that was basically a joke. I returned this book pretty quickly and regret wasting my money.
5,A MUST BUY!!!!!,"I don't even know how to describe this book, because it gives me the chills, in a good way though. I only started casting spells recently. I am a beginner too. So far I have done 2 spells from the book and they both worked!!! I am not even a Wiccan and honestly before buying this book I never believed in any of this until I saw the reviews and bought the book. The spells are pretty easy to follow and the ingredients are easy to find too. I highly recommend it!!!!!"
5,A Must for any witches library!,"It is packed full with wonderful little useful spells! Also it looks old like it was passed down from generation to generation (which is a BIG plus). Not to mention that if you do the spells right and your not just goofing off, you get wonderful results. This is also good for begginers as well as experts. For me even this was my first spell book! If I could I'd give this book 6 stars!I might add too that most of the things you need are household items such as garlic!"
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"Even though this book has a wide variety of spells, it is not that good. Most of the spells require a lot of ingredients are sometimes hard to find. If you ask me, you would be muck better off not bying this book."
5,grest book with a wide variety of spells,"this book was one of the best books that i have on magick.it had many different spells for many different purposes.the spells in this book are also very easy to do and they do not require hard to find items.most of the ingridients needed for these spells, you can either find in your backyard or in a supermarket/drugstore."
4,It is what it is :),"I actually like this book. I've had it for a while now, and though I've only tried a couple things from it, I enjoyed reading through it a LOT! It is cute, and old-worldish in its appearance and presentation. It is not for people who are ""hardcore"" or ""extreme"" about their spellcasting or magic beliefs. It is simple and charming for people who are beginners, or more casual about ""old wives tales"" types of things.The couple of things I did try, worked. :)And I disagree about it being manipulative, as some reviewers have commented. But that, like all things, completely depends on individual life-experience & perspective."
5,The Good Spell Book,"This is a beautiful, charming book, and makes a lovely gift -- whether or not you cast spells! Fun to read, a pleasure to own."
2,Wine opener,I had a much older version that I got rid of when I got this newer model. I was surprised to find that this new model was harder and stiffer to use when pulling the cork out. The technology hasn't gotten better in 20 years??? Also the older model was taller allowing me to pull the bottle cleanly away from the opener after the cork was pulled. This one requires that I twist it at an angle which is cumbersome and not a simple fluid motion
5,Works as designed,Works as advertised. Easy to install and adjustible. No problems and I'm happy with their function so far.
1,magnificent monolougues for kids isn't so magnificent....,"i got this book to use in acting classes... I could not find ONE thing that wasn't completely idiodic. If I had used ANYTHING from this book I would have been laughed out of the theatre. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK! it is really, really stupid. All of the monolouges in these book are originals, written by the author, you won't find any classics or monolougues from books it's just a big load of garbage that the author came up with. the only thing I found to be useful was the thing in the back, the glossery of show business terms and the diagram of a theatre, but other than that the book was horrible do NOT buy it for your kid(s)it is a waste of money and you will regret it!two thumbs DOWN!"
5,Monologues for REAL kids!,Magnificent Monologues for Kids (Hollywood 101)Hollywood 101 Magnificent Monologues for Kids are monologues for REAL kids. Chambers Stevens gives kids a chance to sound and act believable in these monologues. The book has boys and a girls monologue which makes it easier to find that perfect one.
1,I love medieval literature,"Every time I see a book that contains a medieval setting I buy it no matter who the author. When I saw this book by Lori Wick, my favorite Christian author, with a medieval setting and all, I had to buy it along with the other three books that proceed it. This book is truely a favorite that I have read over and over again. I usually finish it the same day I pick it up I love it so much. Thank you Lori Wick for writing such wonderful novels. I am a reader that will buy your books no matter what the story is about."
1,where do i start?,"When I was younger and hadn't actually read any good fiction, or excellent writing, I used to like the Lori Wick Kensington Chronicles. Now I realize that although the story lines are good, everything else falls short. The writing is plain, the characters even worse. You might think the female characters engaging if you enjoy overly submissive, unrealistically innocent, wide-eyed, types with no fiery passion of any sort. And the male characters in most of her books are disgustingly domineering or just dumb. I haven't yet decided. You might enjoy her stories if you don't have a shred of feminism, or if you believe the male sex in general to be superior and dictatorial. The Knight and the Dove carries out these lacks to a fault. In my opinion is is by far the worst of the four."
3,Lori Wick book,i have not had a chance to read this book yet. I have read many of her books so I ordered the whole series.
3,Very slow and unnecessary,"In my opinion, this book could have been condensed down to about 20% of the book. There was a lot of info that I didn't really enjoy reading. The story about Marigold was okay. I thought Bracken and Megan were a bit too simplistic and perfect. Of all the Lori Wick books, this is the worst book. The first three in this series were excellent though."
5,hubby loves it,he uses it everyday and it hasn't broke! He said it was a great buy! And he is really hard on tools!
5,This book WILL change your life.,"My husband and I read this book because he had a severe case of PE. We didn't know what else to do. This book changed both of our lives. You should read this even if you are a single guy as you don't need a partner. If you do have a wife/girlfriend, she should read it if possible. That made a HUGE difference. But only if she's supportive of this (which she should be as it is her problem too). Yes, men, it DOES matter, so do something about it -- read this book!"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I HAD HOPED,"Had thought the book would be more helpful than it was. It did not really explain why some men have premature ejaculation and why others don't. The instructions seemed mechanical and I did not get the ""cure"" that was promised on the book cover! Found the book by Birch (Male Sexual Endurance)to be more helpful."
3,Very high level information,"The information in the book is bit old and most of the information provided (such as how to over come PE...) can be found online. I would recommend ""Coping With Premature Ejaculation: How to Overcome PE, Please Your Partner & Have Great Sex"" since that book had much more information on PE"
3,Difficult to finish,"As someone who has suffered many years from PE, I was hoping to find some useful advice from this book. The first chapter, which I have read many times, is sensational. As I have not yet been able to finish this book, I am hoping that the next edition is better paced."
3,Following yet left behind,"Euclid's Window by Leonard Mlodinow is a book about geometry and physics which really suprised me with a title ""The Story of Geometry from Parallel Lines to Hyperspace."" I figured that the book would pertain to the creation of geometry and the figures who invented it instead it started with geometry and ended with a heavy load of physics. I enjoyed the history of all the inventors of both fields yet the heavy jagor used in some sections threw me off course. At certain parts,I simply skipped over sections to get to a part where I understood what they were trying to explain. Do not get me wrong I gained a lot of knowledge from this book about the creation of geometry and physics alike however I found it difficult to follow at times. I recommend this book to anyone involved in mathematics or physics but to the reader without any background in either a recommend a nice fiction book..."
5,Math Turned Adventure,"Mlodinow's book does the nearly impossible, translating key moments in mathematical understanding into the stuff of gripping drama. The fact that he's written extensively helps; but his choice of subjects, his vision and understanding, takes us away. It's the kind of book to read--and recommend. We live in a world of points, and lines, and space...but Mlodinow shows how understanding..conquering that world...was a real intellectual adventure. Oh, and it is--amazingly--a page turner of the highest order!"
3,You can tell he wrote for television,"Leonard Mlodinow has a good story to tell, but his writing, probably influenced by his stint as a television writer, shows a flippancy that constantly annoys. His ongoing references to sons Alexei and Nicolai make his explications of geometry and relativity too cute - a further annoyance. On page 116, he refers to a spiritual seance as consulting with ""ghouls"". However the participants receivied their information, it would have been from spirits, as ghouls are those who consume human remains. If I consult with my late wife, I am consorting with a spirit; if I sprinkle her ashes on my cereal in the morning, I become a ghoul. I feel this book could have benefitted from more judicious editing than it was obviously (not) given."
3,3 /5ths good,"The first 3/5ths of this book are charming., Quite a nice read. From a mathematical standpoint it is most unlikely that anyone other then a confused kindergartner will be perplexed.This book states it is about geometry but the last several chapters seem to be more political [a bit to the left of George McGovern if you care], anti German [Heisenburg is a Nazi and Schrodinger in thrall to his phallus] and pro everything and one Jewish and liberal [but not Jewish and not liberal]. The last two chapters are about the 20th century how I looked forward to reading them but they are frankly boring stuff which could have been written by any halfway educated collage sophomore circa 1972 ."
1,Charlemagne's back to the future version,"I like math and I am a computer's science teacher in Brazil. But when I read that Dominicans and Franciscans sent teachers to Charlemagne's church schools I became disapointed with this book. The author is very weak in History of the Church. I recomended to him, Kenneth Scott Latourette's book: ""History of Christianity""."
3,Quite good at times,"The book is not so much about geometry, but about some of the significant people and events in the history of geometry. At times I found it fascinating, educational, and witty. Overall, I enjoyed reading it. However, it didn't really meet my expectations. Many of the explanations seemed either overly simplistic or not as clear as they could be (a book on geometry with only a few figures?). And the author's wit became tiresome to me - I'm sure his kids are great, but I felt like I was being forced to watch someone else's home movies after a while. It is clear that he is not an historian, as he states as fact unproven or controversial historical incidents (e.g., who was responsible for the burning of the library at Alexandria).Still, I definitely learned from the book (both history and geometry) and enjoyed a good bit of it. It reads easily."
4,An entertaining look at the history of geometry,"This was a really fun read. Mlodinow gives a good mix of history, gossip, and mathematics. My only complaint was that the last chapter or two on string and m-theories glossed over the math a little too much; the other chapters were a little more descriptive."
5,Great product at a great price.,A treat for my dogs that is actually good for them. Also at much better price than I had found previously at my local retailers....Great product at a huge savings - what could be better!
2,Disappointed in texture,I have bought these dog treats directly from Zukes in the past. I found these to be hard and I felt they seemed stale.
5,My dog loves these treats!,If I hold out a Zuke and ANY other treat...Maximilian always grabs the Zuke's. He loves them! We buy the Hip Action peanut butter recipe. My Max is a 12+ year old greyhound mix. These treats give him energy and excitement. I appreciate the fact that Zuke's are made and sourced in the United States. I do my best to avoid all food or treats manufactured/sourced in China.
3,dog didnt like it,"My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat. I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter. She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it. Will go back to beef after this bag runs out. Just a heads up! I still like Zukes' products tho!"
5,Best way to give glucosamine that I've found,"My dog loves these treats. I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid. These are pretty affordable, too. They also travel fairly well, and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day. The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog's weight. But so far ""over-medicating"" has not been a problem (especially if you break them in half).I've been really amping up my dog's walks and runs to get ready for hiking this spring, and so far he's not only limp-free, but the stiffness he used to get just after a nap seems to be significantly reduced. All in all, we're both really happy with these. I'll be buying them again, and I'll be trying out more of Zuke's other treats."
5,doing well with it,the dog likes it and doing well with it. takes 2 per day. standard poodle is 11 years old.
2,Zuke's Hip Action Is GREAT,"We have been giving our 100 pound shepherd/lab/collie/husky mix Hip Action since he was a pup. Our vet believes this is realy going to help him prevent all the hip problems that shepherd's usually have. Eventhough I cannot buy it locally, I make sure to buy it on line so my boy will remain healthy and happy!"
5,It has rejuvenated by Maltese.,"I have a ten year old Maltese that was starting to have joint stiffness, Zukes has fixed that. RaRa (my Maltese) now is excited every morning to get his treat. It took a few days before a saw a difference in his gait but when i ran out of Zukes for a few days i saw his joint stiffness increase again. The only negative thing i can say about them is that they have a odd smell to them that can linger on your hand."
5,Dog eats it!,I am a first time buyer. My dog eats 2 pieces a day and seems to like them. Hope it helps with hips as product indicates.
4,Zuke's is amazing,Anything by Zukes is awesome! Try to get it when it's fresh though bc the package I got was pretty old and it was too tough but still great!
5,love these,I should say...my dogs love these! I like the ingredients as far as dog treats go. They are nice and soft and chewy. Make great treats!
5,LOVE IT,"I have an eldery dog with hip and joint problems. We have been using Zuke's for a little more than a month and have seen and amazing improvements in her. She loves the way the treats taste and goes crazy at the sight of the bag. She can now navigate stairs, is more interested in play and she even runs on daily walks all because of Zuke's!"
2,Dog won't eat it.,"My pug is, perhaps, too spoiled when it comes to treats. I ordered the chicken and the beef and gave her the chicken first. She turned her nose away. I chopped it and added gravy. She ate the gravy. So I cannot attest to the effectiveness of the product."
1,Tastes like chemicals...my Shih tzu & Pekingese would not eat them.,"Yes, I tasted them - they taste like chemicals but I guess that's what you should expect from a joint supplement. My Shih tzu & Pekingese would not eat them."
3,Didn't seem to work for us,I ordered this product hoping for some kind of positive change in my Puerto Rican Princess. Based on the reviews I thought it could help. After four months we see no difference in her hips. Poor girl.
4,Really helps mobility,I bought these treats for my 16 year olo husky/beagle mix dog. Within two weeks she showed a visible improvement in mobility and seemed to be pain free. She has pretty bad arthritis and these seem to be working very well. The only issue is they are a semi soft treat so they were all pretty broken and in a big lump in the bag. But other than that they are a great product.
2,Disappointed,"I love Elle Decor magazine, but I did not care for this book, or any of the other ones in this series for that matter. The photos are decent, but the decor in the pictures don't seem to be as good as it is in the magazine. I think that there are other books on kitchens that would be more satisfying."
3,"By Command of the Goddesses, we think.","A very nice selection of art thorough out the world depicting goddesses in their differing aspects. The book is informative especially for the novice interested in comparative mythologies. The text is slightly outdated, with the author not just trying to be political correct, but lets some fawning feminism to leak through. Lanier Graham should stayed with the historical-anthropological discussion of the art, instead of meandering into a social didactic."
3,Stylish but not comfortable.,"Very stylish shoes, but the toes are super pointy so you want to order up 1/2 a size. I bought the white leather version and the leather was stiff and the shoes slipped a bit on my narrow heel."
2,Bad literature.,I didn't like it at all. I was specting so much from Timothy Leary that I was so frustrated. I don't know if he has better books (of course he has). But this is really a bad one for me.
4,Half &Half,"This book is filling with wonderfully insightful concepts about the nature of humans perception of reality. For anybody who is truely interested in psychology You Brain is God, or any Leary book for that matter, is a good bet. Leary's ideas led me, as a high school student, to change the way I think, view the world scientifically, and to determine my major in college. My only critque is that Leary uses his ideas as a basis for forcing the use of LSD on the public. About half the book focuses on the use of LSD as a religious sacrament. If you're into that part of the book, you'll love it in it's entirety. Otherwise, pick around it and enjoy."
5,review for: Before I Go To Sleep,"Realistic, detailed pictures. Modern in the way of letting kids know they can be anything they want to be, and fun because it takes you many places, it's adventurous."
1,misleading!!!,"After reviewing many products, this (looked) like a good deal.The appearance was that two dumbbells were sold as a single priced unit.I was troubled and felt taken and deceived to have just one dumbbell arrive.Since there is really no (at least known to me) way of sending this back without again costing me more money, I will bit the bullet."
5,Werner Herzog Collection Contents,"I have not reviewed this collection, only thought someone should list the contents.

5,Manufacturing defect?,"Has anyone else had a problem with 'Lessons of Darkness/Fata Morgana'? I've tried two different copies of this box set and the same few minutes at the end of Fata Morgana won't play. It skips and goes back to the DVD menu.Regardless of that, the box set is worth it. An amazing collection of films, well put together. I want to see the end of 'Fata Morgana', but the other six movies are spectacular."
1,Fata Morgana absent from set,"The disc marked as holding both Fata Morgana and Lessons of Darkness does not in fact have both films on it - Fata Morgana isn't there. I first tried playing it on several different DVD players thinking it was a technological problem; when this failed to show anything up I explored the dvd on my computer, and used both VLC and Apple's DVD player to see what was present on the disc. Fata Morgana is simply not there - the only data on the dvd is that for Lessons of Darkness. The boxed set is otherwise fine and I'd definitely recommend it at this price (if all of the films listed were actually included), but it's either seriously flawed or incorrectly advertised and should never have made it past the presses this way; hence my one-star rating."
4,Nightmares on DVD,"The best way to describe this set is to use Herzog's own words:""A nightmare that you can't stop watching!""My absolute favorite is ""Little Dieter needs to fly!""-What an inspiring story. That DVD alone is worth the investment.""Even dwarfs started small"" might be the weirdest movie I have ever seen, but am willing to watch it again.Buy it if you like Herzog and know his work.Do not buy it if you expect main-stream pop-corn movies."
3,Classic but falsely advertised,"Don't get me wrong. This is a superb collection from a genius film maker. This should warrant a full 5 stars under normal circumstances. My beef is with the manufacturers who have falsely advertised that the film ""Fata Morgana"" was to be included with this set. IT IS NOT. Where is it Anchor Bay? Good thing for BitTorrent, managed to get the movie anyway but still....."
1,This is supposed to be a 4-star review but I can't figure out how to change it!,"This collection was missing a film when I got it, but Anchor Bay responded immediately and I had it nearly overnight. The collection has been wonderful so far, and I was most recently blown away by the epic tale of survival in Little Dieter Needs to Fly. This is known to have been the inspiration for Herzog's Rescue Dawn, but fans of Grizzly Man will see a chilling foretaste of that film toward the end. After watching it I began to see Herzog as an artist whose obsessions are guiding him toward an increasingly cohesive oeuvre, which is fascinating considering the singularity and strangeness of his work. Something big is going on."
1,Poor Amazon information,"Why should I consider buying a product in a box when the contents of the box are not listed? Even the system does not allow me to give it nil stars. Wake up, Amazon!"
4,CAVEAT EMPTOR: where is fata morgana? where is anchor bay entertainment's website?,"this box set is nice enough, but i really wanted fata morgana, and it's not on the shared disk with lessons of darkness. other reviewers have noted this, but when i go to the anchor bay site to seek redress, it's offline! this is false advertising, and if it were ebay, their vendor ratings would be in the cesspool.an annoying defect to an otherwise decent product. herzog should slap them down."
5,Greatest Living Film Maker,"Werner Herzog started making films in early 70's.He is one of the few film master still working today and kept on churning outfine films like ""Encounters at the End of the World"", although I must admit that Icouldn't comprehend his choice of making the ""Bad Lieutenant"".One of his advice to young film maker was to travel great distance on foot.He once walked 500 miles to experience life.His life experiences had reflected in his film choices and subject matters.If you want to watch only one film of Werner Herzog, I would recommend ""Fitzcarraldo"".If you like it, he is your man.Go and get this box set.If not, you are not his man."
1,Not recommended,"Although it's an earpiece, it arrived in an un-sealed package (""Ziplock type"" baggie). It was also missing the over the ear clip, which made it useless. I returned it as defective, and they refunded it within two weeks, however I was out postage in both directions, which was as much as the headset itself!"
2,"it's ok, i guess","speaker and mic work well, but the molding is cheap and it doesnt usually stay in place on your ear very long. can get frustrating at times if trying to talk while multi-tasking."
2,thoroughly unbelievable,"This was required reading for a course on native American religions and I found it to be thoroughly unbelievable. Two of my classmates actually went to Oklahoma to do further research on John Little Bear and their findings confirmed my suspicions about the man. Maybe not a complete and total fraud, but not far from it. Do not expect to learn much about Native spirituality from this book. At the end of the course it was revealed we were required to read this in order to understand how the hybridization of native spirituality has evolved in the last century."
3,Book Review,"If you like case studies of people treated with alternative medicine, this is an excellent book. I was looking for something more substantive, how-to instructions, and/or something about the personality of a medicine man. These individuals are some of history's most influential people. They were priests, doctors, nurses, teachers, pharmacists, architects, designers, and therapists. Their lives embodied the most education and skills readily available with no other purpose than the care of their tribe."
2,Victoria Falls,Disappointing film considering the big name actors. Also historically and geographically innacurate. More like a home movie than a professionally produced film.
1,"Really, really bad...",This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a shame they were allowed to use the names Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.The only performance with any merit was Claude Akins playing Teddy Roosevelt. He was actually pretty darn good.But Christopher Lee should stick to vampire movies.
3,Not correct listing? Doesn't have HSM on lens for Sony....,I like this lens except for the miss leading discription on the lens .... It does not have the HSM for the Sony Digital SLR camera. But the price is the same for it as the other major brand digitals Nicon-Canon? Why do I have to pay the same price for something it doesn't have.... ???? I would like an answer ...please and adjustment on the price I paid. I called Amazon but they haven't replied back? Something to concider when buying this lens. Also it is heavy and doesn't have a really snug fit.
3,"VERY poorly packaged, surprising for Amazon","Calendar is fine -- exactly as advertised, great for the wall, plenty of room to write stuff. The packaging job by Amazon was, surprisingly, horrible! Calendar was CREASED across the middle, and the crease is a permanent one. Very disappointing. I am a very regular customer and buy many different things from the site. This was, by far, the worst packaging I have experienced. Hope they put a little more thought into how to send this sort of item through ""the mail"" going forward."
2,DVD quality,"This review is not about the movie (which certainly deserves 5 stars), but about the region 1 DVD issued by Olive Films: the DVD comes with English subtitles which are overlaying the image and cannot be switched off, and the picture quality is worse than - for example - the German region 2 DVD of Sunfilm (blurred image). Compared with the Sunfilm DVD, the Olive Film version has only two advantages: the widescreen format (the Sunfilm version is cropped on both sides and has an aspect ratio of 1:1,33), and it is complete (in the Sunfilm version some scenes were censored and cut out due to the age restriction of 6 years)."
2,Be prepared,"I read the reviews on this movie here and elsewhere before watching it, and I want to make a few qualifications to the generally glowing report. While I agree that the film is at times delightfully amusing and often philosophically humorous, I found the ending far more than simply ""surprising,"" as many reviewers have reported it. There is an almost sadistic quality to the ""surprise"" for which I was not prepared and wished fervently that I had been. Train de Vie has been compared repeatedly with Life is Beautiful, and while components of the two films certainly correspond, the feel and philosophical message of each film differs greatly. The movie has many good elements, but as an emotionally engaged viewer, I found the ending betraying."
3,Way too wordy,"I had read a long, long time ago that this was the difinitive book on Asian brush techniques; but it was always too expensive.I finnaly bit the bullet and got a used one at a good price. I've only glanced thru it; but I'd be more interested in reading it if it had more illustrations. Wish I had just borrowed it at the library. Think I did look for it; but was unable to find."
4,The Way of the Brush,An excellent book for anyone interested in or engaged in the practice of Chinese Painting. All aspects from the way to hold a brush to mounting the painting are discussed and illustrated.
4,Excellent all the way around,Ordered as a gift for my brother. Arrived promptly and in good condition (just as described) considering it's age. Happy with product and service
1,"One Word . . . ""Boring!!!""","If you think that there is nothing worse than hearing someone drone on and on about how great their vacation was, stay away from this book. ""Chasing Lance"" is nothing more than the author's vacation diary that has less to do with the race and more to do with the cafes he visited. You will get next to no insight about the race or its ""behind-the-scenes"" stories. If that is what you are looking for, I recommend ""Lance's Wars"" instead. You have been warned."
2,Not for a true Tour fan! But if you like Martha Stewart this might be the book for you,"I don't plan on writting a long review, frankly I do not think this book worrents one. I have read most of the books out on the Tour and am an avid fan of professional cycling and this is by far my least favorite book on the topic. If you are a Tour fan who enjoys reading about the details of how a stage unfolds or even want to learn a little more about Lance than this is not the book for you. On the other hand, if you are someone who cares more about what the author ate or where he stayed on a particular stage, this is the book for you. I have never seen an author dedicate 5 pages at a time to such topics while only mixing in a page or two on the actual tour. And even then, the author does not capture the magical moments and amazing stories behind the riders that make the Tour so special."
1,Rip Off Con Job,"If you want a a non-experts point of view on the 2005 Tour De France who has nothing interesting to say, other than describing the facial features of the people he runs into in the cafe ha happened to drink on the 3rd stage, buy this book. If you care about race tactics, tour history, or anything at all remotely compelling do not buy this book. Its a rushed travelogue intended to take your money. Buy ""Lance Amrstrong's War"" if you want a real book."
2,"Don't think 'deluxe', think 'small'","It's no surprise that Rand McNally produce large print versions of some of their road atlas books: the so-called deluxe version is small in size and content. The maps are too small to be useful for driving purposes. The book contains predominantly half-page summaries of major US cities. While the cities are well covered, the atlas section is poor. I bought this to replace an older version of the basic Rand McNally US Road Atlas and wish I hadn't bothered. The spiral binding is a useful feature but what use is an open page if you can't see the maps?"
5,Cheaper than buying it at Fallingwater,"So, we'd just gotten done with the tour at Fallingwater when my wife pointed out the gift shop. We really wanted to get this book while we were there but the $55 price tag seemed a bit high. So, we decided to check out the price on Amazon and saved $20. As for the book itself... it's written by Edgar Kaufmann who was a member of the family that built the house as a summer escape. So, he's quite qualified to write this book and lends a unique perspective as he actually spent time living in this national treasure. The pictures in this book are fantastic as well. If you can't get to Pittsburgh to see Fallingwater, this is the next best thing."
1,Musicianship and production quality = terrible,"I get it that it's parody, but man - when you can't even produce a steady 4/4 drum intro (see the beginning of the Wild Cherry parody), you should reconsider whether releasing said ""music"" is going to be glorifying God or having the opposite effect.Terrible production quality, inferior musicianship, poor singing. It's painful to listen to. Leave the parody to Weird Al, who has actual skill."
1,Terrible!!!,"This is like the Weird Al of Christian music!!! I know a lot of people think it is good because they change the words so it becomes a Christian song. The problem is it's something copied for the sake of making money by labeling it Christian. You might as well listen to Eminem, Ozzy, Vanilla Ice, and Queen. I listened to Ryan Dobson's podcast (son of James Dobson) and I just heard about this group. I listened to the Eminem song and it was horrible. The singing is terrible!! To get Ryan Dobson's views on this group listen to his podcast from 1/25/07 at [...]"
5,Great Blasts from the Past... Clean versions!,Can't beat the wide variety of music styles created near authentically to the originals! Classic Rock & Roll and contemporary songs scrubbed clean!
2,Short on substance.,Not enough information on any specific area to pique my interest. All most like TV news only in book form.
4,Beautiful Art Masterpiece.,"Art Pepper,Saxophonist extrodinaire, drug addict, music visionairy,artistic contemporary. Many of these terms have been used to describe the inigmatic Arthur Pepper, however, within the scope of musician, this man was clearly a master of his medium. Perhaps in the same vein as [Charlie] Parker. Live at the Village Vanguard finds Pepper surrounded by an excellent group of musicians. The repititions of selection may be a bit redundant for many, however, none of the material is done in the same manner, and IMHO, allows the material to remain fresh and new. I highly recommend this pricey boxset to Pepper neophytes as well as to old school Pepper fans."
1,rubbish,"The song listing on this (and companion volume Psychedelia vol 1) looks great! But most of the recordings are terrible quality, many sound like very poor bootleg recordings - nowhere on the packaging is it indicated that they are not the original recordings - so beware!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE!!!,"As a 20 year veteran of the IT industry, I have always recommended that people buy Western Digital drives. I had NEVER had a problem with one until the WD2000JB drive. I have now had 100% failure on these drives--my 3rd of 3 that I purchased has now died.The store that I bought these from agrees that there is a serious problem with these drives."
1,I would give a zero star if I could,AVOID AVOID AVOID.Went bad just out of warranty.May want to avoid WD altogether as well.
2,No cables supplied,"No cables are supplied with this item.I've tried to order them directly from WD a week ago, but they seem to have lost my order.I've upgraded my computers over the last twenty years, and this is the first time I haven't had a cable with a disk. It should say cable required."
3,"Nice Flip Case, problems though","I just got it and wasted no time slipping my 40gb ipod in for a try. It fits quite snugly and looks as you'd expect, there's a little opening near the bottom on either side so you can slip your fingers underneath and press the ipod back up and out. The flap has sleeves on the inside and a little pocket on the outside for earbuds. Overall, I like it. However, as I'm partial to the ipod dock and never having to touch cables, I find myself unsure whether I picked the right case. There's a hole to allow the dock connector cables to reach the port, but the case is too fat to slide into the dock, naking you choose between discarding the dock or using a different case. I'll try it out, but I think this configuration will eventually lead me to purchasing a belkin or speck case..."
2,NOT AS PICTURED,"I ordered this shirt. It's a Red Sox shirt, and moreover a Ted Williams throwback. That said, it definitely deserves some credit. However, the shirt says ""red sox"" across the chest, it does not have the ""B"". I really like the ""B"" and that is what I expected to recieve. Not so. When I emailed the seller, they stated it ""must be an old picture."" Thats the reason why I give this shirt 2 stars. The item pictured is different than what I recieved. Too bad. Otherwise, its a cool shirt. Just be sure to check with the seller to make sure their picture is accurate."
1,Not a Hoover Part,"The part I received was not what was advertised. The original Hoover part was pictured in the Amazon ad, but the part received was made of wood. The original Hoover part is made of an acrylic plastic. It also has an auger shape to create some air flow. The part I received was made of wood in the shape of a cylinder. I spoke with a local Hoover service center and was told to beware of gray market Hoover parts. (They had the part in stock, but the cost was $13 higher.) He also stated that the wooden brushrolls were not as reliable as the acrylic plastic ones. I complained to the vender and my money was refunded in full."
1,Caution,My purchase arrived and not what I ordered. Agitator I received is much larger and has yellow brushes. No contact number for customer support and no reply to my e-mail.
4,Vacuum Revived!,"So this replacement part is just that a replacement part it is not just like the original as in the picture. It is wood and has the yellow bristles that many other reviews commented not wanting. It would have been nice to have one like the original (hard thick black plastic - for this I rated 4 stars vs. 5, as I fill the product was slightly misrepresented) but I will say this has been a great replacement. Let's just say I had not realized HOW BAD my vacuum had really gotten. That being said this replacement brush roller has revived my vacuum. I have been very pleased at this point with the purchase. I have used approximately 1 month. Also, shipping was super fast; I had it by the end of the week."
4,"One year and 100,000 revs and still working.",I feel a little silly writing a review of something so mundane as a repair part. But Amazon apparently invites it. So I'll tell you; this part is working better than the original. The upright vacuum sweeper no longer makes the terrifying noise that it had made since the day it was new and it is not longer burning belts faster than I can buy them.
1,Don't waste your money.,Trys to review all of Oracle 10G and basic SQL commands in less than 360 pages. Too high level and contains very little PL/SQL included.
2,Wrong title and fails to focus on a target audience,"I don't know why they called it PL/SQL 101, given that only 2 out of 11 chapters actually are about or even mentions PL/SQL. What it actually is is a brief introduction to databases, Oracle 10g, and brief explanations of various parts of that.It starts out with explaining what a database and a spreadsheet is, and then goes on to try to teach you a bit about everything in only a few pages. If Iwould have to guess, the target audience for this book would have to be not too technical management, to establish a brief understanding of what Oracle is so that they can actually talk with the database administrators. Still it sometimes delves into technical details that is of no use to thataudience.For people who actually know what Oracle is (and are likely buyers of a title like this), it is mostly a waste of time.Still giving it 2 stars, since most people reading this book would probably at least pick up one or two things they didn't know..."
2,Los Grandes Exitos Brillan por su ausencia,"Este CD apenas tiene 2 exitos de Hernaldo. Exitos comoEn el mismo TrenQuiero saber todo de tiUn pasajeroNO ESTAN EN ESTE CD. Este es una recopilación de canciones buenas pero poco conocidas de Hernaldo, que seguramente cantó hace muchos años en Chile. Muchos éxitos están ausentes."
3,Song,"This is a lovely song, minus the 'F' word in it. It really wrecks the whole mood of the song. I mean would you like to have someone sing a swear word at you?"
4,Great temps once you get it applied.,"It can be tricky to spread, but if you follow the new instructions and just apply a ribbon it is pretty easy.Droped my temps 3 deg c from AS-5"
5,A quality thermal compound,"I really enjoy this thermal paste. I have gone through multiple syringes of the artic silver 5 Polysynthetic Silver thermal paste and decided to switch it up. While the 5 Polysynthetic silver is fantastic, I don't think I will go back. I really enjoy how easily this stuff spreads on the CPU while applying. It also has a nice ""stick"" to it when putting the heat sync on. I cannot speak for any difference in temperatures or conductivity as I did not test them, however, I am sure it is negligible.I will buy it again and I would recommend it. 5/5"
5,Great Stuff,"Got here quick, this stuff is sticky but works very well. I used it on my graphics card and my processor."
4,Arctic Silver Ceramique Premium High Density Thermal Compound 2.5g,This is good for computer builders and has a lower price than the online electronic stores.A must if you are changing your cpu.
5,Good!,"I did what I needed! Cheap and useful! Highly recommended! It works perfectly, one month since I use it! Still working fine!"
4,"Good stuff, good be a bit bigger but 5 bucks aint bad","Arctic silver is pretty much the best thermal paste your gonna get, i woulda likes a little bit bigger canister but for 5 bucks you cant go wrong"
4,Good Carpet Cleaner,"Got this promptly from Amazon a month or so ago. I cleaned 2 large rooms and did a very good job. Better than the last ""professional"" cleaning 2 years ago. Since then there have been a couple of small spills on which I used this machine. It did a good job on a red wine spill. I used Walmart's cleaning fluid.The product seems well designed and constructed. The tool rack comes off for storing which is recommended during use. The short coming in my mind is the tank sizes for clean and dirty water. But that is the function of the size of the unit. It is large enough now so larger tanks would be a bit unweildly.The cleaning width is a good size and the cord length adequate or large rooms. Cleaning the tank is easy and accessible. I chose this product based on the leading consumer report publication."
4,really does clean well!,"i was surprised at how great this thing cleans carpets. after cleaning, the carpet is only slightly damp, and drys quickly, as if a professional cleaning service had done it. you really need to read the instructions carefully. how to use it is not intuitive, but if you do pay attention it will do a great job. it is mostly plastic, and you need to be careful... but for the price it is fantastic"
4,super cleaner,I love how easy this machine is to operate and my carpet looks like it did when it was installed 5 years ago.
4,Great Multi-function Machine,We found the SteamVac intuitive and easy to use. We love the hard floor cleaning action and look forward to using the power hand brush on furniture and car interior.
5,super carpet cleaner,"I've tried many carpet cleaners, including the big units you rent at the hardware store. This is by far the best. The tanks are large enough to make a real difference in the frequency of emptying and the rug is clean and dries very quickly.I have three dogs and three cats - all indoor pets and this is a lifesaver."
4,Good product!,"I say if your going to buy a steem vac this is the one! I have used many different kinds and brands and so far this has been the best. I give it 4 stars because it doesn't quite get all the water off the wood floor like I think it should, but it is great for the carpet! Cleans well, dries fast, easy to use."
2,Good....at first,"We purchased the All Terrain about six months ago. The instructions are very well written and assembly was easy. I fired it up for the first time and it cleaned the carpets beautifully. I thought we had a real winner. After that initial use the problems began to creep up. Starting with the second use, the clean water tank began leaking around the seal at a fairly significant rate. I probably should have returned the unit, but I didn't, and now regret it because it is now totally out of commission. The brushes are connected to the unit via a drive shaft that is less than 1/4"" thick plastic. On our cleaner this shaft sheered off and is stuck in the unit. Only at this point did I do any serious research about the All Terrain on the Internet and realized that these two issues are very common with these units and apparently dealing with Hoover for repair can be a nightmare. Caveat Emptor"
1,Continually breaking,"Cleans carpets pretty well when it works - which is not very often. Cheap plastic parts keep breaking. Most importantly, the six plastic brushes are all gear-driven from one of the brushes that has an elongated square shaft. That shaft shears off at its base - it is not strong enough to drive all the brushes on moderately thick carpets. The brush set has been replaced three times already. Basic design flaw that could be remedied with a steel shaft."
5,Awesome,"I have had this STEAMER for almost 10 years. Yes, I have replaced the clean water tank twice, but I still consider this an excellent machine. The STEAM comes from the HOT WATER you put in the tank. YEA, I boil the water I put in the tank so it doesn't bother me that I have to replace a $50 part once every 5 years. WHY would you use CARPET SOAP with a steamer? The hot water is what cleans and to really freshen my 6 dog house, I add some non foaming deodorizer to the clean water tank. If used correctly, the carpet is virtually dry by the time you finish. I ALSO use this steamer for non-carpeted areas. The spinning brushes work on any surface. I also use the hand attachment to clean upholstered seats. GREAT MACHINE."
4,Feedback on Hoover carpet cleaner,"The product works very well and has great suction. One disappointment which occured - and had been noted by other reviewers - there are two platic type locking devices that are on either side of the lower water tank, that latch the lower tank in place. After only 3 times using the machine - one of these plastic locking devices have already broken - it is flimsy cheap plastic. The tank should still hold in place and the other latch has not broken but I anticipate it might, and it makes me concerned that the lower tank (which houses the dirty water), will not be as secure as it could be, so I need to be more careful so that the lower tank does not come loose."
1,Cheap: Plastic parts break,"We had an original Steamvac that still works, we thought a new one would work better. It does slightly.I read reviews which stated to be careful with the plastic water/soap and dirty water containers. The plastic is brittle and breaks.Well after 4 months a small tab on the dirty water tank handle broke. The handle does not function too well now. I could probably still use it but I need to get it into Hoover for a warranty repair.I called the local Hoover repair center, he said it takes 6-8 weeks. He had nothing good to say about these, other than he is making a small fortune by handling the shipping and receiving of these these new plastic parts. He said they are junk. I now believe him. When i read the reviews before buying warning about the plastic parts I though maybe the people were handling the plastic containers roughly or something, nope, it really is junk.Stay away from these things."
5,Pleasant Surprise,"I had some very set in stains and this Hoover did the job fabulously! I did not experience the problems other reviews mention. It was a concern of mine upon purchase however, I had heard so many wonderful things about this particular Hoover. I figured I would retur it if I wasn't satisfied and this is one cleaner NOT going back!"
1,Junk,"Look elsewhereSteamVac name is misleading....there is no ""steam"" involved at all. Description mentions ""heated"" cleaning. The unit doesn't even have the ability to heat water. You must use hot tap water.Clean water tank leaks badly...."
3,Hoover SteamVac,Easy to use. Cleans well. But left streaks in the carpet of areas that seem to be cleaner or lighter color than the rest.
4,As Described,This product works great as described. I think if you are having problems with leaking you have to make sure you always use the recommend cleaning solutions for this cleaner
1,Very Disappointing!!,"The steam vac doesn't clean well, it's very heavy, and to call it a steam vac is a misnomer. I can clean my hard floors better by hand. I was excited about getting this product for my hard floors and area rugs. It did such a bad job on my hard floors that I didn't even try it on my rugs. So, maybe it works on rugs, but it doesn't work on hard surfaces."
2,Good at first!,I was intially impressed with this unit. It cleaned and made my carpet look great.Then it leaked! Think it broke! So I had to buy an updated tank because Hoover decided the disign must have been faulty. So they redesigned the tank at my expense.Now it steaked my carpet even with a cleaned filter it still really made lines in my carpet as the brushes still would not move.I made the decision to stop this insanity and get another brand.
2,Different item then ordered,"The item I order was BLACK that is important to want I wanted. The item shipped was blue , hate that color.Missing tools Crevice tool was missing.The Power Scrub tool lip is broken.Contacted hoover a week and a half ago asking for missing tool and only the clear part of the scruber to replacebroken part. have not heard back.Great Cusomber Service. Had I purchased this at Wall mart I would be on shelf by now and my money would be in pocket."
5,Time Tested Design,My old Hoover needed a little adjustment to get the brushes to spin on each use so I decided to buy another. This is the same Hoover with a couple of slight modifications. My carpet is bone dry within a hour and clean. The pile is fluffed and feels good to walk on.I don't understand why people are breaking the plastic parts. Follow the instructions and there won't be any problems. I'm on my second Hoover Carpet Cleaner and haven't broken a single piece. It is made the same and from the same materials as the old unit.I haven't tried the All-Terrain feature yet but I'm sure it'll suck the vinyl off the floor along with any dirt.
4,Easy,I used the product once. It is heavy and loud. Allot of plastic parts I was not exspecting. Did a good job but with heavy traffic and soil must do it again. I am satisfied
3,"Great Machine, warranty-not so much","(I wanted to give this about a 3.75 rating, but couldn't.) This machine never worked from the beginning. The soap dispensed, the clean water didn't. It has great suction and cleans wellwhen I added water manually. When I took it in for warranty repair, I was told that a part was completely missing and the repair would take 4 weeks and cost 19.00. Really? For a warranty repair that was completely covered? When I emailed Hoover directly, I got an answer about how to make sure the machine was working and where to take it for warranty. I love the concept, just need to make a more reliable machine and warranty. I think when I get it back, I will love using it."
1,second defective machine,This is the second machine I received and both machines brushes quit working when working with it for the second time of use. Please send for a pickup.
2,NOT FOR TILE FLOORS,"IF YOU HAVE POROUS CEREMIC TILES DO NOT BUY. We got this product to clean our downstairs which is made of ceremic tiles. Even thou this product is called a ""SteamVac"" it does heat the water and it uses NO steam. The water is only as hot as you place into the container. It also lacks the scubbing power to get tile clean that might be a little bit porous. This product did make a bit of difference on the floor but as I said but with our tiles being porous it left so many places uncleaned. This product was easy to use I will admit but that does not make up for the fact that I wasted so much time trying to get my tiles clean with no real results. We have not tried this on carpet as so many people have stated that it works well on yet but not sure we will try. So if you have carpet maybe give this a try but as I said if you have any type of tile that might be slightly porous, RUN the other way and find something better. Thanks for listening."
5,Outstanding Unit,I purchased this about a month ago and we have a new puppy that is now potty trained but it took over a month to do so. We bought the maching to take care of stains left behind by cleaners used to clean the mistakes the puppy did. This machine took out stains that have been in the carpet since we bought the house and we have an off white carpet so everyting shows. I am extremely impressed with this device and would recommend it to any of my friends.
5,Hoover carpet cleaner,"The Hoover max extract all terrain is awesome. I have used the competitors models in the past and they dont clean the carpet as well.The assembly takes all of 5 minutes because the directions are clear cut.I had a pipe leak onto the carpet and this machine cleaned the entire carpet almost making it look new. I checked the carpet after cleaning and it was barely damp and i went over the spots like the directions said. The bisel would have drenched the carpet, with less results.People who said things are breaking may not relize this is a consumer product, not commercial.I would recommend this product to anyone. The $20.00 or $30.00 more spent on this unit is worth it"
3,disapointed on unpacking of item,"Received Hoover Max Extract all terrain carpet cleaner in a company sealed box and appeared not to be opened prior to being sent to me. Upon assembly notice the return tank on the bottom has 2 release valves, one was intact but the other was missing and at first found in box but it was broken. So I can't even use this product for at least 7 business days until company sends me a new one. I hope this performs better than released from the company for sale. I am very worried now on quality control.Note to follow in about 10 days."
1,Worst product I ever brought,"I heard about this product from CR. This had very good rating. When I opened the box, I could not believe something like this could be made so cheaply. It was not at all sturdy. I debated if I need to keep or return the product. Based on CR rating and feedback on this forum, I decide to keep it. When I started using it water started leaking from the back and my floor was all wet.While I was using extension to clean my stairs, I had to put vaccum cleaner on a think mat to soak water.Thanks to Amazon 30 day return policy. It is now with them and waiting for refund....Ahhh.. Amazon does not allow me give less then 1 star.."
1,hoover junk,"Used many times and each time something would brake off, I used it to get my monies worth. but however, it started with the handle(s) breaking off both bottom and top holders, then the whole back hose broke off, then the squair peace that rotates broke inside of spinning motor, then just one of the of the six brushes broke off, then it stopped spinning sometimes. Im suprize they would let something like this be on the market. they should REFUND everyone or get sue!"
3,Really Hoover?!,"I was extremely disappointed to see my All-Terrain leaking clean water during the first use and not just from the tank, it happened with the hand-held portion as well. It was replacing the Hoover SteamVac that I have had for years but finally began to give out. I was realy happy with the cleaning power and dry time, but was really upset to see the puddles of liquid that followed me. I read other reviews and thought it was worth a shot, but these problems are not acceptable, especially for the price. Returning my unit and trying to find another, less leaky soultion."
2,So many problems,"I've had this machine for two years now, and I've had nothing but problems. When I first put it together, some of the screws didn't fit. Now, I'm a handy person, and I know how to assemble things. The screws didn't actually screw in, so every time I turned the vacuum on, they just fell out. I have the handle duct-taped to the machine now. It also leaks very badly. In addition, the clear plastic part on the front that sucks the water back up gets clogged very easily, and there is NO WAY TO CLEAN IT. Therefore, my entire cleaner is clogged with dog hair. I have to take a long screwdriver to pry the hair out. (And yes, I do vacuum my carpets before cleaning, but there's no way to get all of the dog hair out of the carpet.)Today I went to clean some more carpets, and now neither the suction nor the clean water dispenser works.It does clean well, but the shoddy design and myraid issues mean that I'll never purchase another Hoover again."
3,carpet cleaner,I was pretty happy with this cleaner until the plastic parts started breaking off. I can't believe they use plastic on handles for a heavy water canister. It broke the second time it was used.
1,Got 2 both broken right out of the box,"Purchased this item to replace a bissel which lasted about a year after being repaired once. The first arrived an found a Broken piece in the bottom of the box, package it up and back it went for a replacement. Second one arrived and the same piece was broken. In my opinion all these household carpet cleaner are made of junk plastic. I have email customer support at Hoover to see if they'll correct the problem. I can't recommend a product that continuously comes broken out of the box."
5,Cleans extremely well!,"The Hoover carpet cleaner is exactly the product I was looking for instead of hiring someone to come clean the carpets. Although the cost of the soap could be lower, I find it does a comparable job to professional cleanings."
4,great machine for the price,"I owned a Hoover Floormate for years, it had some glitches, but did a good job. So far I like the all terrain, I have an entire house of Italian stone, laminate, and tile floors. Anything is better than a mop or hands and knees scrubbing. If it breaks after warranty, it was still worth the money."
1,For the money it's not worth it!,"This cleaning machine has nothing less than cheap unreliable parts! It may ""suck up the dirt well"" but the dirty tank on the bottom handle easily breaks off allowing little or no dirty water to be picked up. It leaks cleaning fluid and clean water terribly. The bare floor spinning brush broke at the insert the first month of cleaning. It is a shame that they have put such poor unreliable parts on this machine. And it is not a steamvac.... there is no heat at all."
4,Hoover f7452900 SteamVac All terrain At great PRICE!!,Hoover F7452900 was one of my best buy this year. I am really impressed with this product and my carpet looks brand new again. I love the six spinning brushes they really work.James
2,Don't ignore the leaks!,"We initially loved this machine. We have a new mastiff puppy and have used this machine many times in the few months that we have had it. I will say that it does do an excellent job of pulling water back out of the carpets. Last night we did a quick spot less than an hour before the in laws came over and the carpet was dry on their arrival. HOWEVER, in the first week the clean tank began leaking when placing it back on the base. Just a little bit at first and since we liked the machine so much, I ignored it. Now, every time you put the clean tank back on the unit, water pours down the back of the machine. I have tried every little way I can think of to put the tank on to keep it from leaking (including following the manual's directions for those who claim operator error) and nothing has helped. Thankfully, we can return the cleaner without a problem, but what do you know, the store where we purchased it is no longer carrying it. Huge disappointment."
1,Hoover Hell,I purchased the predecessor to this model 3 years ago. I've used it less than 15 times. Just past the 1 year warranty I had to replace the fresh water tank ($50) because of a leak. A few months later the trigger to spray water from hose end attachments broke spraying water everywhere. You must purchase an entire new hose for $35. The little plastic trigger is the only thing on the entire hose that broke...and it's removable. Why do I have to replace the entire hose for a plastic piece the size of a dime? The trigger broke again yesterday (I got about 3 uses out of this replacement one). Looks like I'll have to order another $35 hose. If you do buy one of these make sure you don't store the unit with either the fresh or waste water tanks installed. Keeping the tanks installed in storage warps the gasket and makes them leak. Overall I wouldn't recommend these cleaners. Pay for a professional or rent a cleaner.
3,Hoover Carpet Cleaner,"The Hoover F7452900 carpet cleaner is a good cleaner; I have no complaints with the way it cleans. The only complaint is it is not a very durable machine. After using it a couple times it started falling apart, first the handles broke off the tanks, the seals started leaking, then the other day I was cleaning my carpet when the handle broke in the middle and the tanks went flying, I was left with the handle in my hand and everything else on the floor. Granted the parts are available for repair but for what it cost the tool should last a bit longer. I have spent all most what I paid for the machine to keep it running as what is coast to buy."
2,Hoover MaxExtract,The handle to the container that holds water broke when I took the carpet cleaner out of the box. The hose also drips when using. Once I glued together the handle the machine works great. Need to contact company about the hose.
4,Works quite well.,"Works quite well - we've used it 2 times on a heavily soiled off-white wool carpet, and think the results are as good as a professional cleaning job.Constructions seems a little flimsy. While nothing has broken yet, I will not be surprised when it does."
4,Hoover Carpet Cleaner,"I was somewhat disappointed in the performance of prior models from the Hoover line of carpet cleaners. But after Consumer Reports highly rated this carpet cleaner, I thought I would give it a try. I must say that it performed very well. It is easy to use and the scrubbing brush assembly is slightly wider than prior models. My only suggestion is that the user spot-treat (I use Resolve spray as a pre-treatment) heavily soiled carpet prior to cleaning."
5,Highly recommend.,"I borrowed my friend's Hoover carpet cleaner to see how I liked it and ended up ordering my own the next day. I've had this for over a year and find it the easiest way to clean all my floors. Easy to use, cleans deep down, suctions up most of the water, carpet dries fast. I also use it on my vinyl flooring in the kitchen and tile floor in the entry way. The cleaner removes grim and scuff marks that I would normally have to remove by hand. Those floors are dried almost before I am done using it. I highly recommend this for all carpets. The hose kept getting in the way so I removed it and hung it on a hangar in the garage. You only need the hose to clean upholstry, but I find it way to troublesome to use, so I don't."
4,"wonderful product, just one draw back",i bought this steam vac for my cleaning business. it does a wonderful job on both carpets and hard floors. only this i can say that i'm not very happy with is the amount of cleaning solution it uses. for the average house it takes three to four refills.it is very easy to use and very simple to clean after usage.
1,very disappointed,"At first, I was thrilled with this steam vac. Changing the parts and cleaning the brushes took a bit of an effort, but it did a great job on the carpets.I had only used it 10-12 times before I noticed fluid dripping from the back. Unfortunately, the 1-year warranty had just expired, so I took it to a local authorized dealer. They said that the hoses were cracked and that the repairs would be over $200.I had used the vac very lightly (I don't have a lot of carpets), but with these repairs the total cost per use to date would be almost $50, not including the cleaning solution.I would not recommend this product."
1,Will never ever purchase another Hoover due to their customer service center,"My unit was about 1 1/2 years to 2 years old. But this is a steam cleaner. You don't use it everyday right? And this was not the least expensive steam cleaner we could have purchased at the time. After maybe 5 to 7 individual uses the cleaning solution portion of the unit falls off. We had to replace the entire water barell ($[...]). After two more uses the handle of the water receptacle (the brand new piece) breaks in half! Thats not the best part, when I called the company (Hoover) the customer service rep was outright NASTY. He ends up yelling at me! Voice raised, irate tone and all. When I called to speak to a supervisor, she said O I will look into it. No apology. No explanation. Nothing. So this is definitely my last Hoover even if I have to scrub my floors by hand!"
1,Mad at your money? Buy this doorstop,"I've owned this imposter for about a year, I've used it six times. The lower tank handle broke, I've ordered a replacement for it, and weeks later, I'm still waiting for the geniuses at Hoover to send it. In the meantime, the spinbrushes have stopped working, I have done everything the manual suggests in reviving them, but now I am learning online, the spinbrush failure is A COMMON PROBLEM with this model. This is not a simple repair, but an expensive repair job. Again, The product is a little more than a year old and used sparingly, and the feature that scrubs the carpet fails?? And it's not just a belt that needs replacement, it's the turbine deep inside? I will never EVER buy a Hoover product again. Save yourself the total aggravation, and the waste of money. I had a Bissell Pro-Heat that lasted for YEARS, without a problem, until it simply wore out. I now must go back and buy a Bissell."
5,It's like we have new carpets,We have lived here 5 years since new. We have a cat and dog. We have done nothing except vacuum.The all terrain cleaner has renewed our carpets. So much so that we decided to get new furniture.The machine even made our old furniture look great to resell.Great machine!Worked great on our kitchen floor too.
5,Bought it and Love it,The only problem with the leaking that many are complaining about is operator error. It is very important to seat the clean water and detergent tank into the handle as described in the users manual. Failure to do so will result in leaks. For those still having a problem try laying the handle down/horizontal when installing the clean water tank. It is hard not to get the correct seating when the handle is horizontal to the floor.Everyone testifies to the cleaning performance and I echo their praises. The work was very easy and the effort resulted in every bit as good a cleaning job that professional cleaning service could have provided... pet stains and all!
5,Hoover Hits A Homerun,"This is the third carpet cleaner we have had over the years and this one is, by far, the best. The waste tank doesn't leak some previous ones we had did and the power is awesome. It was a sound investment with an indoor pet."
4,Great rug cleaner for the price,"I purchased this shampooer for my extremely dirty carpets in my home based on the fact that my folks have owned the earlier Hoover model for several years and still use it regularly. It's pretty easy to use and really does a great job and you do not necessarily need to use the Hoover brand shampoo. It was not super effective on really soiled spots, though, but I also did not bother pre-treating or anything so I can't fault the machine. Also used the hard floor cleaning aspects of this model which I had not even planned on using when I ordered it. Must say that it did an even more impressive job on my hard floors than on the carpet (Thanks, Mom! :) I would just caution that you really should rinse and clean all the components after each use. The whole thing is made mostly out of plastic - albeit high grade, heavyduty plastic - but still....Basically, take care of the machine and it should take care of your floors for several years."
2,Steam Vac that produces no steam at all!!!,"I will keep it short. Initially it cleaned the carpets okay not completetly. The unit DOES NOT produce steam as expected by the name. It barely heats up the water if at all. The bottom of the unit leaks and even after uses water will drain back out of the unit onto the floor that wasn't sucked up into the tank. It was basically a mess to use and requires too much work to clean small stains fast and effectively. Unless you want to set up, clean, and the clean-up and put away this unit for small stains it basically sits in your closet until you want to clean alot of surface area."
1,Product review,Very crapy product...it makes a lot of noise and does not work for hard wood floor. Plastic was broken after 2nd use. Dont buy it.
1,poor quality,this is a very poor machine...should have payed more attention to review before ordering....the machine leaks alot!!! and now after having for 3 and 1/2 months the motor is blown...may want to reconsider this product.
3,Cleans great - build quality not so,"This unit did a great job cleaning an old carpet. Stains were removed. Dried the carpet very well when used according to directions which require four passes on the carpet. 1. Soap/scrub, 2. rinse, 3. vac, 4. vac.Love the separate soap dispenser and the rinse cycle. Saves soap when your cleaning is interrupted and you dispose of the cold water and refill with hot - no soap lost.Only problem I had was the handle on the clean water tank is suppose to hold the tank in place. It does so somewhat weakly. Once when it was not locked securely, the tank fell out and broke the handle making the unit unusable the 2nd day I owned it. Now waiting for a replacement.A great idea poorly executed."
3,"Everything about this machine is great, except....","This is a great machine! It sucks up the dirt very well! However, the upholstery hose attachment quit working as soon as the first time I used it. Not very happy about that. I examined the hose attachment button you push for the soapy water to come out and it is made out of very cheap plastic material...hence the reason for it to start dripping excess soapy water from the button area, and then quit spraying water altogether. I hope they will send me another hose as I cannot even use this one any more.After looking for product reviews online, I noticed this machine is available for sale at Walmart...need I say any more?"
1,Would not recommend,Very cumbersome system for removing waste water. Hoses and accessories to not fit well on the main unit. We returned it.
1,Hoover MaxExtract cleaner,"I had an older version of a similar product from Hoover and it worked great.This model does not work as well as a much older vacuum that it replaced.The spray nozzle on the vacuum hose leaks when it is not being used (vacuum only not vacuum and spray).The new method of connecting the hose to the tank leaks dirty water onto the floor.the water connection for the hose leaks as well.When used as an upright vacuum on hard floors, it also leaks and leaves a mess that is almost worse than the dirty floor."
5,"So far, so good","This arrived in good shape. Assembly was not completely intuitive. The accessory rack with tools and extension hose doesn't secure the hose very well, but you can simply remove the whole rack if you're not using any of the tools. Carpet cleaning is easy with this machine, and very effective on most spots. Really set-in spots need pre-treatment.I've heard a lot of concerns about the durability of these machines. I've only used this one twice, so I can't speak to that yet, but this is one item I would recommend getting the extended warranty on."
1,"Spin brush only work for 1 time and broken, Service is really expensive.","I got this carpet cleaner on early 2012 and I cleaned my carpet in our 2 bedrooms. It worked fine. At the end of 2012, I try to clean my carpet again I found the brush head was not spinning. It simply became an very heavy vacuum. I only used this for 1 time and only cleaned two bedroom's carpet. Thats it.I was in 1 year warranty so I went to a service location from Hoover's website. The lady told my they will charge 79 dollars plus tax for the cleaning fee which is not included in warranty. Without 79 dollars!!? I bought this thing for 200+ bucks and just used one time then I have to pay 79 dollars to find where the problem is?I will never consider any Hoover carpet cleaner. It is only 25 dollars to rent a carpet cleaner from Meijer or Walmart. This is even better."
1,"At First, Great Carpet Cleaner. Then...","I purchased this a couple of years ago, and for awhile it was a great carpet cleaner. It really got stains out well (I have a cat that cannot resist tossing up on the carpet, when there's perfectly good tile right next to her). The only thing I was dissatisfied with initially is that the cleaner didn't pick up water as well as my older cleaner (which died a dramatic electrical death), the carpets took longer to dry, but no biggie.Now the thing leaks like crazy. It still gets the carpets clean, but after a few minutes of running this loud beast, it starts leaking water everywhere and I have even more to clean up.I wouldn't recommend this model to my friends, even though CR makes it a recommended buy. I've also seen that other people have had the same problem I have, that it leaks.I'm now looking for a better model that won't leave the floors wetter than a sheepdog that has been tossed into a swimming pool."
1,Broken,"I assembled the whole thing, when I plugged it in, it make a VERY LOUD horrible noise. I have owed 2 of them before- they only last about 2 years with minimal use. I had to unassembled it all...it was a real pain to get back into the box! It took me about 1 1/2 hours to assemble & the reassemble.Next time I will another brand!"
4,The good -the bad- the ugly,The Good- this machine does a very job of cleaning carpets and rugs .It does an average on high traffic ceramic tiles and linoleum floors.The bad - on board tools are not sturdy and do not really stand up to tasksLike every other machine on market waste water compartment low capacityCleaning brushes at the head the machine can be troublesome if you haveLots of pets. Vacuum well before using carpet cleaningThe ugly - detergents are very expensive but I have used off brand detergentsW/ solid results. The weight of the machine may be troublesome especially whenFilled.Overall pretty content we have several high traffic areas and have severalLarge breed dogs so I am not giving this an easy task to complete
4,Works well,"The MaxExtract All-Terrain is really easy to use. I've read reports that it leaks, so I take care not to overfill the clean water tank and I've had no problems with it. I'm amazed at how dry the carpet is after one pass of the dry cycle."
1,Defective design -leaks after 1st use,The unit is defective by design. It will leak from the clean water refill tank. So you can not refill it without makeing a mess. And if you try to use it it will just leave extra water into your carpet. I did not save the box (threw it away the first day- I've learned my lesson) so I am stuck with it.
1,Bad design and cheap components,"I purchased this unit about one and half years ago, and used it four times.The cons:1- The Fresh water / Soap tank is poorly designed and WILL leak both soap and water. I was so careful and I still leaked in areas I did not want to clean. (you must attach the tank on the spot you are cleaning otherwise it will make a mess somewhere else)2 - The dirty tank handle broke from one side the second time I used it.3- The clean water tank handle broke on the third time I used it.4- The motor had a slight smoky smell after 10 min of usage on the third time I used it.5- The motor just started smoking and completely stopped working on the fourth usage after about 10 minutes.The Pros:The assembly was easy and both the specs and options looked very appealing.The vacuum did a good job at cleaning both the carpet and hardwood floor.This purchases was a wasted $270."
3,"Pretty good, Pretty expensive;","Note, have NOT used hand tools yet.Plus; heavy, so the weight helps with the suction and cleaning.Plus: The solution/fresh water tanks have good capacity, so you aren't stopping as frequently to refill.Negative: no real bottom handle, can be awkward to pick up and carry.Negative: the dirty-water tank construction is a bit muddled, takes some getting used to.Negative: the dirty-water tank is held in with 2 swing-in holders. I'm constantly forgetting to loosen them. One of these days I am afraid I will damage or break one.Overall:I feel it's a decent carpet cleaner. IMHO, you need one that is heavy in order to effectively suction up the water solution your spraying out. If not, you will eventually end up with a carpet full of dirty, soapy water. It is NOT inexpensive."
3,"Great cleaner, breaks easy","We are acutally on our second one of these. Granted they do a great job cleaning your floors and carpets (however tiled or hardwood floors you may need to wipe up excess water) and they are pretty easy to use. The major problem we have with ours is that they arent necessarily built to last, our first one we had for maybe 3 years and the part that spins the brushes broke so we ended up buying the newer version, now our second one just did the same thing. Also we have gone through a few tanks between the two units because the thin plastic breaks easy. If we dont get it fixed and decide on a new steamer it probably wont be the Hoover again, at about $300 I want it to last a long time. If you dont plan on using it much it may last longer but with animals and a 2 year old I need something I can use pretty often."
4,hoover steamvac,"aside from the extremly loud motor while in operation this steamvac does a fabulous job.i experienced no leaking and feel that persons who did ,did not have the water tank on securely. recommend this machine for its cleaning power. put up with the loud motor and you have a fantastic machine."
5,"Dirt grabbin, water suckin he-man!","I am a neat freak about my carpets, cleaning them once a month, and I'm in love...this machine is SO what it says it is. We have NEW carpet and it got dirt out -- it totally extracts the water also , so there is a very short dry time for carpets. Easy to operate,fill, empty ~ an all over great machine. One tiny drawback is the clean water container..hard to get ""seated"" but not at all a major issue, not when over all machine performance is so terrific.Highly recommend this machine"
5,Excellent Carpet Cleaner,"We purchased this carpet cleaner after a lot of research and because we have two boys. This carpet cleaner is AMAZING. It works very well and we have not had any problems with it leaking. We have light beige carpeting in the two year old's room (note to future parents - this is NOT a good idea), and last night, after Thanksgiving dinner, he threw up dinner, which included a lot of red Jello and Cranberries, on the carpet. After getting the two year old cleaned up and the bedding removed, we got out the Hoover and started cleaning the spots. The spot has now been on the carpet for 30 to 45 minutes. After about 10 minutes with the Hoover, you cannot see any of the spot, even when you know exactly where to look. My wife and I are very impressed with carpet cleaner, and after last night, VERY glad we bought it."
5,Hoover does it again,"This is our second Hoover carpet cleaner. My mother-in-law borrowed the first one and never brought it back. This MaxExtract is an imnprovment over our 7 year old cleaner, which was also a good one."
5,Great machine,"After a bad experience with a commercial carpet cleaning service I let my carpets go for too long, dreading more trouble. I found the reviews of this machine and decided to take a chance on it. Good decision! My carpets cleaned up like new with this machine and I found it very easy to operate. From now on the carpets will be ridiculously clean because I'll use this machine regularly. I found it to be a great product."
3,Plastic Broke on First Use,"I reviewed all of the reviews and Consumer Reports prior to purchasing. Overall the product performed well and as described in the reviews. However, on the first use the the plastic that secures the handle on Dirty Water Container broke. Hence, I am not sure about the long-term integrity."
3,Hoover vs Bissell,"Which is best the Bissell 9500 or the Hoover All Terrain SteamVac F7452900, they are both priced about the same. To find out I read all the reviews on both Amazon and Best Buy and here is my analysis.Both units have their plusses but on Amazon 68% of the reviewers gave the Bissell the highest five star rating while those reviewing the Hoover only 49% gave it a five star rating. Clearly on Amazon the Bissell is favored.On the Best Buy web site they ask "" would you recommend this product to a friend."" In the case of the Bissell 90% said yes but in the case of the Hoover only 55% said yes. So The Bissell is again a winner. The next question is why are people dissatisfied with the Hoover and the answer is that they often leak and the components easily break.Next question, where is the best place to buy a Bissell 9500 and that answer is Best Buy who at this writing has them on sale for $254.99 with free shipping."
4,Hoover help,"Easy to use. I was going to give up on the carpeting, but this hoover has saved it. I have a ten year old beige carpet and it cleaned up the spots. I was ashamed to have people come into my house, the carpet was that bad. The only criticism is that it is a heavy machine, but it worked so well. I followed the directions and I used the recommended products."
1,Works great .... when it isn't in the repair shop,"I love this cleaner for all the reasons others have mentioned however, after every other use something breaks. It has been in the Sears repair shop 5 times in the last 2 years - and I don't use it that often!! THANK HEAVEN WE BOUGHT THE EXTENDED WARRANTEE!!! I can't use the lemon law because it is a different problem each time. No suction, brushes not rotating, tank leaking heavily and more. I would stay away from this model."
4,REVIEW,"The carpet cleaner (I've only used it for carpets so far) does a fantastic job cleaning carpets and is very easy to use. However, the packaging was not great, and a piece had been dislodged from the cleaner. I was able to reinstall it after I had figured out where it belonged. Only one reservation - it is made of many plastic parts, and I wonder how long they will last. Also, to my surprise, (I am a regular Amazon shopper) I later discovered that the item was $21 cheaper at a Sears store."
4,Impressive,"Worked very well on a heavily, soiled and stained playroom carpet(pets). Just as good as the pro's."
2,Attachment Brush Doesn't Rotate !!!,"Pretty frustrated when I tried to clean the stairs the first time, the attachment brush wouldn't rotate to clean, so I have to call the hoover customer care to solve this problem."
4,Amazon's Hoover MaxExtract easy to use,"Hoover MaxExtract replaced another Hoover carpet cleaner that I had. The new one has two separate tanks, one for the clean water, and one for the dirty water after extraction. One feature I appreciated was that the hose does not have to be attached to the carpet cleaner if you don't need it, which made it easier to push around. I can easily clean up traffic areas now without much effort."
4,Great cleaner,Have owned this for a few months and have used it strictly on carpet with it performing well. It does seem to extract a large amount of the water used which does allow the carpet to dry quickly.
3,it does not remove stains very well,"i expected it would clean better. It is difficult to use , but I decided to keep it to use it between professional cleanings."
4,Good starter for writing!,"I have been analyzing different educational softwares with an emphasis in writing for a class that I am taking. I have looked at a number of writing softwares and found Creative Writer 2 to be one of the best ones. I do think that they could have done better in the writing prompts and explaining the menu- it is a little hard to get started. Overall, children will really enjoy this software and be able to use their creativity when writing."
4,In fairly good condition,It was in fairly good condition and I got it at a reasonable amount of time. :)
2,A bit cheap,"Came in a package like you'd get at a Halloween costume store. The felt is very thin and poorly cut, so that the ""V"" cut at the bottom was off-center and ragged. My 13 year old still loves it, because it has anything to do with HP, but I wasn't thrilled."
5,wall decoration- no educational value,This was a great gift for Harry Potter loversprice and shipping were great even during the holiday seasonwould order again if I needed more
2,'Harry Potter Hogwarts Banner',"'Harry Potter Hogwarts Banner'I got this for my daughter's Harry Potter birthday party.she was so excited;Until we opened it.the banner was ok,but the string was a black shoelace and the dowel was broken. I thought it would be cool; But i was mistaken.WARNING:DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM THIS SELLER."
1,Junk,"This is a review of vol 1 and 2. This is one of the worst manga I have ever read for 2 main reasons - the characters are absolute cardboard cutouts, and the plot is totally unoriginal. The fact that the books are very quick to read through and so don't give good value for the dollar, and the art is rather bad didn't help either. I agree with the reviewer that the plot and overall feel of the book reminded me of Legend of the Overfiend, but with a weaker plot, and even less engaging characters if that is possible. When it can be said that a porn movie (because that is basically what Legend of the Overfiend is) has better plot and characters, you know you are in trouble. Also, for those looking for titilation, you won't find too much - there isn't a lot of sex/nudity here - Battle Royale vol 3 for instance has 10 times more sex than these 2 volumes put together."
2,waste.,"not only did i waste my money on vol. 1 of the arm of kannon, but for some reason when i was at the book store i bought the first three volumes. bad choice. this manga sucks. first off, the story is kind of interesting, however the author didnt put it together very well, and when the dialouge and drawing is lame, then you're not in for an enjoyable time. the art is quite dark and spastic, but it isnt used tastfully at all. the action scenes are pretty boring, nothing you've never seen and alot of times its pretty hard to tell whats going on. there also is a fair bit of nudity, not used tastfully at all either. by tastfully i dont mean make it prudish, i just mean use it where its needed and dont just throw it in the comic because your story and characters suck. overall a boring book, as are the following volumes."
5,Richard Page is back - and better than ever,"From the day that I opened this CD and began playing it, I've been thrilled! It was a long wait, but well worth it; My Oxygen, Dependence and Just to Love You are standouts for me. I hope we won't have to wait too long to hear from Richard again!"
5,Makes ya Feel Good!,"A true 5 star album!, the second last track is the only Below average song!, ever other song is very good to Brilliant.Great production, Fantastic song writing!, tight backup Band.richard page: former mr.mister/pages released this GREAT album in late 96!what can i say about his album? it has it all, the middle of the album flirts with mellow acoustic songs, the beginning flirts with experimental reggae/sound scape. BUY THIS ALBUM, if you don't like it, I'll Pay you Back!"
4,"Very interesting, Very hard to get into...but, well worth it","I can say that by reading this book, you can see how Gardner thinks and you will (when you read the book) see how he tries to form his Gardnerian tradition . Whats great about the book is that Gardner puts himself into the book. Also another note, this book is the first time he mentions his own BOS within the book. Whats hard about the book, is the wording of ""old world language"", so, you'll have to read it slow. If your a Gardnerian such as me, you'll enjoy every bit of it.Even though this book is out-of-print, its not that hard to find..trust me!."
4,Great lego for my son.,"My son has most of the Lego Star Wars items and enjoys them very much. They are not always the best toys to be played with as most should be for display only, but he plays with them and if they fall apart we put them back together."
5,Very Great Toy,"My 9 year old son says ""I think this item is a very fun toy. You can do lots of fun things with it."" I liked it because he was able to get it together himself, and I didn't have to help him. He's very happy with it."
2,Doesn't Readability Start with a Printing Quality?,"The quality of printing is pretty poor, and therefore the readability of this book is pretty low. As for answers, Barron comes with the Answer Key that is for the most part sufficient. I believe anyone will be better serced by Barron and by Prentice Hall Brief Chemistry Reviews."
3,Very Basic - Some bad information,"This is a pretty good video for the very beginner that wants to learn to play by ear. It covers basic 3 chord playini in the keys of G, D, C and A, which is enough to get started and have some basic skills to play in beginning / slow jams. For those that do not want to worry about music theory, this is a pretty good video in my opinion.One note: When the host talks about ""beats"", sh's not using the conventional meaning of that word. What she calls one beat is actually 2 beats. This could get a little confusing when playing with other musicians, jut remember that 2 beats in real life = 1 beat on this DVD."
5,Puts It All Together,"Not a difficult read...yet puts together in historical context the development of the different lines of Islam, their internecine conflicts, leading to the state of Jihad today and for the future.If you ever wondered how the Grand Mufti could have become an SS General in Berlin, or how ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" has led to chaos in the modern world, this book will make sense to you. It will help you understand what world Jihad is all about, and why a united Muslim front is difficult to obtain.Most highly recommended for serious student of modern geopolitics!"
5,Amazing,"This is the best moisturizer I've ever used. (with the exception of La Mer moisturizers, which are arguably better but more expensive) Even though it is pricey by comparison to many moisturizers, it is well worth the cost especially considering that many nice face moisturizers fall in the $40-50 price range, you might as well up-grade from a so-so moisturizer to a truely amazing moiturizer.The cream goes on light, but it very very moisturizing (not a bit greasy but and can handle dry skin in a snap). I use it with their face wash, which I also highly reccomend. My skin is clear and exptionally soft. Even though it is a high priced moisturizer, the product quality.******* Even though it dosen't state it on the product description when I purchased this at Barneys the sales woman told me NOT to apply it to the eyebrows, as the ingrediants might lighten the hair"
5,Great decision,"I was first thinking about this lens a year ago. I had seen some great results on different forums but ended up not buying it. I bought a teleconverter instead for my existing lens. Now a year later after being disappointed with the teleconverter I decided to go ahead and buy the Bigma. What a difference. The images are sharp, there is no CA, edge sharpness is good. Yes, it is a little heavy and not the fastest 50mm lens out there, but who buys a 50-500 zoom for the short end anyway? I took it out to a local lake and got some great shots of Osprey, Red-tailed Hawks, and Herons. None of these would have been possible without the Bigma. All shots were taken hand-held. The Bigma on my K10D with shake reduction work well together. I took a few test shots handheld down to 1/60th, while not crystal sharp there were still far superior to anything I could have gotten with the teleconverter on a tripod.All in all I highly recommend this lens."
5,A great book from someone who's been there.,"Susan Diamond's book is the most realistic I have read of this type of ""true-life"" book about the professions dealing pregnancy and birth. I do recommend it for everyone, but with the warning that it may disillusion you! This book should be taken as a call for change in the system. In too many places things are just as she has described them. It does not have to be that way. The only thing I really want to know, after reading this book, is... what is Susan doing now?"
4,Good but incomplete,"A good guide to what happens in hospitals. Unfortunatly, Ms. Diamond is still so convinced of some obstetrical myths that she doesn't even acknowledge them (eg. episiotomies as unnecessary, not cutting umbilical cords.) Definitly worth reading if you're planning a hospital delivery. But don't forget to read one of Henci Goer's books to get all the facts."
2,Not worth $30,"I wish I waited a couple weeks before buying these, because now there are better bowls on Amazon. It's not that these are ""bad"" really, but for the price I paid I expected the lids to fit secure and snug."
3,Name is not accurate,"These items are described as burlwood, which is not accurate. They are normal wooden turned bowls. From the grain pattern I would guess that are pine or another softwood with what looks like a walnut stain. Craftmanship is average and the price is a little steep for quality and material."
5,Extraordinarily Beautiful Wooden Bowls,"I bought these as a gift for my son who recently received a wooden ""Go"" board and is fascinated by the game. These wooden bowls are exquisite. They are larger than I imagined, but this seems to be the usual size of ""Go"" bowls. These are a special addition to the beautiful board and pieces. They really add to the aesthetic of the game!"
3,I thought it would fly but...,"I had very high expectations of this book based on the reviews I read so I bought it. It is a lot better than the User's Manual that came with PSE 2.0 but it is not ""the one"" that an ""advanced beginner"" like myself would need. Mikkel Aaland needs to expound more on ""what happens in the background when you do this..."" The Missing Manual people will do better job the way these group prepare a book."
1,Avoid like the plague,"I bought this book expecting the enclosed CD to be a full tutorial. It is not. If you read far enough into the fine print it does say it is a trial (read demo) copy. To my sorrow I didn't see this; all I read was ""100 before images"" and ""follow along with the book"". Sounds great, but what you get is software that shows you what the real thing WOULD do if you bought it. Legal but morally reprehensible."
2,Not for the beginner,"I got this book because of the included CD and because everyone was raving about how it held your hand as you went through the steep learning curve. Well, the CD is next to worthless. It has pictures on it but finding the picture and putting it with the text is difficult.The text seems to be written for someone who already knows the ropes. He takes you through how he did something true, but why is never explained. Example, ""set the radius to 4 pixels"". What's the radius? and what does it do? He often uses keyboard shortcuts but doesn't explain where he got that info.As I said, I was looking for an introductory book--this ain't it."
5,Photoshop Elements 2 Solutions,Excellent book. Gives you step by step instructions on how to do some neat things with your digital photos.
2,Unsturdy Bar Stools,The bar stools are pretty to look at and that's all they are good for. They are very unsturdy. I'm afraid to allow anyone to seat on them.
3,Very Nice but a little unstable,"When we viewed these online, we though they were perfect. When we got them they looked perfect and made such a difference in our living area. When we sat on them though, they felt a little wobbly. This is a problem for us since they get a lot of use. We are going to try and strengthen them with ""L"" brackets.If you do not anticipate them getting used everyday they are great, but if this will be your primary seating and eating, you may want to be prepared to add extra support. For the price though, I think it may be worth it."
5,This book can be found under another title!... :),"This book is the original edition of what is now titled ""IS Your Child Hyperactive? Inattentive? Impulsive? Distractible?"" (ie: the one with the question marks, and note that the authors are the same). Please see my 5 star review for this book on that page. You don't want to miss out on this book!"
5,Terrific!,"This Yaoi series just keeps getting better. Its plot is similar to Fake but lighter in tone. Goh and Taki are simply gorgeous. In Volume 2, more emphasis is placed on their relationship. Will Taki finally give in ? Is there any reason for his reluctance, which we hope to find out in Volume 3 ? One comical yet serious question posed by Taki if he is to give in to Goh is: will he be the woman or is Goh the woman in their love making? After all this is Yaoi and the answer is relevant and important. Looking forward to Yellow Volume 3. Do yourself a favor and get this series."
4,It is compatible for Ford Ranger,RE: Warn 37780For compatibility it reads that it will not work for a Ford Ranger. Actually it will. It is an upgrade for the auto locking ones that are common to fail or are unreliable. Just read up about it on TheRangerStation.com or TRS.
2,"Not as good as I was expecting, so I returned it","I enjoy backgammon, esp. on a nice set, so I ordered this item a couple of years ago to add to my ""collection."" I didn't have any wooden tabletop sets that don't fold, so I thought this might be interesting, as it looked appealing in the photo. It wasn't so great, however. It was smaller than I expected, and there some issues --some of which I can no longer recall exactly-- so I did not think it was at all worth the asking price, and I promptly returned it. As I recall, the points are not inlaid and they are not even particularly well placed, and/or the checkers do not fit the board perfectly, so when you line up the checkers along the edge of the board they are not properly centered on a point, e.g. You can find better designed boards for less, ...and I did."
2,Bought by mistake,"Buy this Cable Management System by mistake but as I live outside the United States is very expensive to return the product. honestly have no use for me, I use it as a very expensive paperweight"
3,A Little Expensive,"razer products are known for having long, lightweight cords and so in order to counteract the awkwardness of that I purchased this...it works well for the most part but was considerably overpriced."
5,Addicted!,"This by far is my favorite of all the Kind Bars. Not too sweet, but sweet enough to settle a sweet tooth craving. A healthy alternative that tastes great!"
2,***STALE***,"In the past I've bought these from a local grocery store and they were soft, chewy, moist, and delicious. unfortunately the batch I just received from Amazon were dried out, crunchy, and stale. wondering if the boxes sold here are expired overstock. buyer beware - food items can not be returned. am hesitant to try again..."
5,Great tasting bar,"This bar tastes great and the ingredients are simple: almonds, coconut and honey. As pure as you can get. Gives me good energy for my morning workout."
1,DO NOT GET THE APRICOT,The only good bar is the coconut one and this isn't it. It's apricot and it's disgusting. Plus it's stale. The coconut one is good though.
1,NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD SCOLIOSIS SURGERY,I couldn't walk or move after taking her workshop at the Yogaworks in Brentwood. I went as a source of pain relief and ended up feeling worse than ever before. I couldn't get out of bed the next day and was in severe pain afterwards. She says it is good for those who have surgery DON'T Beleive it! She doesn't know what she is talking about! She has never had surgery! I had the harrington rods put in back in 1995 and trust me when I tell you this is not for you if you have had the surgery!
2,Yoga for Scoliosis with Elise Browning Miller,"I'm experienced with yoga and was disappointed in this DVD. I have scoliosis and lumbar problems which I receive chiropractic care. I found it difficult to follow the demonstrations by Elise. I'm a teacher of yoga and when directing students in class to move their ""right"" or ""left"" body part, I lead in mirror image that simplifies students following. In addition, while following the dvd to adapt to the correct direction, I hurt myself. There is not enough encouragement by Elise to be aware of your body while doing postures.."
2,Waste of money,"I have a significant S-curve and have been doing Iyengar yoga for about a year. I was looking to learn poses particularly beneficial for pain relief or tips to adjust the regular poses for my condition that instructors may not know about. However, very little in this DVD is scoliosis-specific, it is basically an introduction to Iyengar yoga - how to stand, breathe, and do very basic poses. Anyone can learn all that by going to one yoga class, where you also have the benefit of an instructor's presence. The only useful thing I learned from this video was rotating the position of my hand in downward dog in a way to pull in my mid-back curve. Not really worth 30 dollars, in my opinion. The author claims to have reduced her curve through yoga, but even if that's true, clearly it was not done via such elementary sequences. Would only recommend it for absolute beginners who don't have Iyengar yoga in their city."
3,Thanks for the warning,"Bless you for mentioning the poses included on the DVD. I cannot do the Downward Dog, or Child's Pose due multiple fusions and will not make this purchase, as a result of your feedback. You just saved me much irritation!"
5,Replacement Hoover Brush Roller works well,"This review is for aHoover Elite and Legacy Brush Roller. My upright Hoover vacuum cleans much better with this roller, which replaced one whose brushes were severely worn off towards one end owing to it being incorrectly reinstalled and used extensively after a belt replacement. I've seen reviews commenting that the core of some replacement rollers are wooden and this may be the case here although it does seem to be made of a very solid and heavy material and it does fit into the vacuum perfectly. In any case, the vacuum is much more functional and useful than before the replacement."
3,Good for limited/special purposes,"The quality of the recordings on this album aren't great, but to me that sort of just added to the feeling. For the price, it's a decent compilation of tracks that, if you like, you can find in better quality on other albums."
5,As advertised,"I build computers on the side so you occasionally need an extra screw, Its great to have plenty in stock. They are as advertised and work just like they are supposed to."
5,Y TE VOY A OLVIDAR,"IS EXCELLENT THE MEANIG OF THE SONG IS GOOD.I THINK EVERYONE IS GOING TO LIKE IT, CAUSE IS A BEAUTIFUL I RECOMEND THIS ALBUM CAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO LIKE IT ."
5,Jim Brodey - Urbanity and Profanity,"Jim Brodey lit up the Lower East Side of New York City for thirty years. Alongside contempories like Ted Berrigan, Anselm Hollo and Ron Padgett, Brodey helped to change the shape of what we consider 'modern' poetry.The Heart Of The Breath is Brodeys' final, magnificent statement to the world of poetics. In these pieces, Brodey rearranges the world to fit into his broad and dynamic parameters - which include anything - literally - ANYthing. Leaving no stone unturned, fearless and bold, Brodey walks through these pages like a lion stalking his prey. These poems are filled with humor. These poems are filled with pathos. These poems are strange. These poems stalk off into the fog and dissapear forever.These poems breath."
4,"Jane and the maid: good, but still room for improvement.","A 2008 summer reading list mini review.When I began reading Stephanie Barron's fifth installment in her Jane Austen series, I was very much impressed. The satiric glimpse at her cousin's foibles was almost equal to Austen herself. I also liked how each chapter was offset by excerpts from the victim's book. The excellent characterizations of the early chapters really brought the tale to life for me.As I continued and then completed the book my initial rapture waned. While character was king, pacing was poor. The book plodded along unhappily to conclusions that seemed obvious midway through the book. I found Jane and the stillroom maid to be superior to its immediate predecessors but no where near the quality of the initial entries."
2,Predictable,"Altogether too predictable, making it a huge yawn. An excellent idea going to waste under this author."
4,fine mystery,"I've enjoyed the previous books in Barron's series about Jane Austen as sleuth, and I will proceed to read the rest of the series, though I was slightly disappointed in the details of this crime. I thought the murder itself was unnecessarily brutal and distracted from the otherwise fine writing.Barron captures the tone and style of Austen very well, and the series in general is a pleasure to read. Regular readers will be pleased to see Lord Harold Trowbridge, and the secondary cast -- from Austen intimates to the elevated residents at Chatsworth -- are excellently drawn."
3,not as good as the earlier fit for life books,"To be honest, I couldn't even get through the first chapter. I haven't even read the whole book. I kept thinking, Harvey, get on with it! I guess It's because I have read his previous books and know the way of food combining, but he sure takes his sweet time getting to the point with this one. Save your money and buy the original Fit for Life. There is more information in that, recipes, etc. This book just repeats what has already been published previously. I give it 3 starts though, because it is good information in general."
3,Read them ALL!,"I have just read Fit for Life 1 & 2 & this one too. I found this book just to be extracts of 1 & 2 rearranged with nothing new. The only thing I liked about this book, is that in some chapters, he places his suggestions into points, making it easier to get back to. I dont recommend this book to people who want a deeper understanding of Natural Hygene. What I didnt like, was his repeated mentioning to buy his products from his website, especially those fruit enzymes, he sounds just like the 'cashectomies' that he despises!"
5,I finally got it!!!,I did the fit for life a long time ago and just didn't get it. I didn't understand what I was to do. I got this book on Friday and today is Monday and I've lost 3 lbs in 2 days.Mr. Diamond makes it really simple at the first. Eat Live food!! Make it the most food you eat. Eat other things but always eat a large salad with your 2 other meals except breakfast. I didn't think I could eat that much salad but I have 2 huge salads each day.So far I've had the fruit for breakfast raw fruit only and I'm doing great even tho I'm hypoglycemic. I think I've finally got it. I'm going to keep it up as I have severe fibromyalgia and I can't stand the pain anymore. I'm allergic to the meds the doctor gives me so this is it for me.Thanks to the Diamonds for their work on their books. I'm going to go back and read the other books again now that I understand the concept. EAT LIVE (RAW) FOOD!!!
2,Fit for what?,Found this written poorly and full of mostly opinion and bluster. Didn't have a desire to read a sermon.Fit for Life: Not Fat for Life
2,ok if u want to go vegetarian,"personally, dont think the diet works well, plus is boring if u like milk products and meat products."
5,The Best,I can't say enough about Harvey Diamond. I first read this book in the early 80's and I have tried to follow the concepts ever since. This book is practical and makes so much sense. The way of eating is natural and requires little discipline. The hardest part is just keeping fresh food on hand 24/7. I think this book accurately describes the way humans were meant to eat. I highly recommend it.
3,Red Midnight,"The book Red Midnight written by Ben Mikaelsen is about a twelve-year-old boy named Santiago and his-four-year sister, Angelina, who's village of Dos Vias, Guatemala is burned down from Guatemalan soldiers. All of Santiago's and Angelina's family is shot, leaving the two children to escape into the burning night to find a way to get to the United States of America. They end up taking a sea kayak with the help of some friends, through the rough and dangerous waters of the ocean. Will they survive? Read the book and find out! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read adventure stories. Red Midnight is an easy-to-read fun story."
5,Classic Soft Jazz - pre Kenny G Era,"I have been listening to this ""Album"" for about 15 years now.. and for those that have not heard it ... you are missing out. This remains Tom Browne's finest work. Now, I have my woman hooked on the closer I get to you... A must have"
4,100% perfect,This charger works perfectly. I use this on Europe so i need a different plug stuff and works perfect
4,Wrong measurements,"They are quality made covers, however they arrived with different dimensions: 11"" x 19 1/2"" x 7/8"" deep. Not the 1 1/2"" as described. So if you need the full 1 1/2"" depth, don't be surprised."
4,Burner covers,"They are just as pictured. The print is very crisp, and adds a touch of artistic flair to a tired, old kitchen. Thanks. M. E. Evans"
1,Not such a great idea.,"Look, don't pee on yourself. It's common sense. If you get some kind of sexual pleasure out of being urinated on and drinking urine, well, go to it and have a good time, I guess. But don't pretend that it's some kind of 'therapy.' Be honest with yourself.I suppose that this book is a good place to start if you already like to piss on yourself and you're looking for a good explanation in case your husband finds out. Yep, just keep this book handy and whip 'er out when anybody tries to tell you you're a pervert. This book is just a classic case of new age therapy techniques gone way too far. Next thing you know, they'll have you pulling feces out of public toilets and shoving it up your nose; it's not a far cry from what Van Der Kroon is actually suggesting."
5,Emerging - A step step beyond...,This book has changed the face of our early childhood program.It has become our journal and map to providing a more appropriate child directed program. I have found that it released our teachers from the bounderies that surrounded them by guiding them to a classroom that is focused on the children's interest and yet provided an approach that was within reach. Emergent was always a frightening concept - but this book brought it down to earth for the staff by walking them through a year long journey of group of teachers - many of them with personalities that are similar to ourselves - breaking down each step and showing the simplicity of the concept. I recommend that this be a guide to all early childhood programs that step forward in their quest to providing a developmentally appropriate enviroment for their children
5,"A very touching, heartwarming story!","Jimmy was a clam digger from Maine who joined the Military before Pearl Harbor and was present on December 7th, 1941. This is a story of a man who suffered and the love of his family. He experienced extreme medical problems from Malaria and overwhelming bouts of depression. The account of Jimmy's life is sad, but uplifting. This father had faith like we all wish we could have.'Love Jimmy: A Main Veterans Longest Battle' is a true love story; the story of the love a daughter has for her father. As you read, your tears will swell then dry up, and a smile will crease your face - all for the love of a family.Ms. Osier writes a very touching, heartwarming story. This is one you will want to read.Reviewed by award-winning author, Bobby Ruble, author of Have No Mercy and co-author with wife, Kam, of Black Rosebud: Have No Mercy II."
1,did'nt work,well I went to use this tester for the first time (it is for my bike on the road) it did not work! bad place to find out my bust should have checked! but I was going on a trip so i just put it with other tools and it just stays on bike. Well yesterday I need to check something and it did'nt work even stoped and got new batteries and still nothing so I must have a bad one well see if it can be replaced. But this one did not work!!
3,Description misleading,"Would not have purchased if I knew it was for one pair, description made it sound like two of each."
2,Not so much,"I bought these after reading good reviews. Maybe I just need to try them in other shoes, but they seemed to be too wide in the middle, so didn't fit my shoes quite right."
5,The best for me!,"When I started using these my pain went away right away, after a few months they of course need to be change because the plastic flatterns but thats ok, I have to adjust it to the firm one and it worked very well no pain at all.When the store that I always buy them from stop carrying them and started carrying another non adjustable kind, the other Dr Scholls is not as firm as it needs to be. I was worried that they were replacing the Adjustable ones with the new ones so I am very happy that I can still buy them."
3,It's not bad but it isn't great either,"I bought these because of my high arches and they're ok. After a couple of weeks they ended up being too soft even with the firmest support in place so I ended up buying another generic brand. The other brand is MUCH firmer but sometimes I don't need that much firmness so I alternate them depending on how my feet feel. If I'm having a lot of pain, I'll wear the Dr. Scholl's since they are softer"
1,I lost my money buying this item.,"I got this with the colletor box set. I paid US$30 extra just for this an a very bad figure of Gollum. After i watch this DVD i found that have no interested information at all. Just was a ""Tv commercial"" about how you can buy more figures of the lord of the rings.I'm from Chile.. and i was really excited waiting for this item.It was a bad purchase... considering the extra shipping cost that i had to pay for the weigth of this product.Just buy the extended edition. The rest of the collector box doesn't worth it. Don't lost your money.Carolina from the south of the world"
1,Not worth the $$,"I was expecting a DVD on how they created Gollum, but only got a 30 dvd infomercial on the collectibles released at the time of the movies. not worth the money."
4,Encouraging,"This is a wonderful book. The layout allows you to read only a few of the entries or, if inspired, the whole book. As always, what Mother Teresa says is touching and simply profound. The meditations found in this book allow you to witness the beauty of a life of service."
3,"Good enough to pass, but just barely","I used this book as the basis of my prep for the two solaris 7 exams.The good news: if you understand everything in this book, you will most likely pass. (Make sure you have extensive hands on solaris admin experience to back it up)The bad news: The book misses major parts of the exam, covers things (sudo, tcp_wrappers, etc) that are not even part of the solaris distribution, and the practice exam has about a 10-15% error rate.Since there is only 1 other book out there on the market that covers this exam, you might as well pick it up and use it along with the objectives listed on the Sun certification site as the basis of your study. Just dont expect to blow the exam out of the water based on what is in this book. (but then who cares, its pass/fail)"
5,This is all you need for certification.,I have been a UNIX sysadmin for 6 years. I was looking for a good material for certification and finally found out this excellent book. This is a much better and revised edition compared to the Solaris 2.6 certification books. It is well organized with good explanation for all the chapters. There are planty of practice questions to prepare for the test. It took me just 2 weeks to pass both the certification tests on the first attempt ofcourse with good scores. I would highly recommend this book for certification.Thanks to Bill Calkins for putting together a great study material.
3,PRETTY GOOD BOOK,"This is basically a good book. There is a web site for errata, but I found that only 1 error was still wrong in the book. The rest were already fixed. Also, the book contains some errors that are not on the errata web page. For instance, page 104 (top), third bullet: ctime in the inode table does NOT refer to the time the file was created. It is the time of last change to the inode table. Unix does not track file creation times per se.Also, p. 21, concerning startup scripts, the scripts are NOT linked via hard links to /etc/init.d/. The example on p. 24 correctly shows the creation of a soft link.The practice exam CDROM also has similar errors. And the practice exam will not run on Solaris! What is wrong with this picture???But it's still a good book--definitely better than going into the exam cold turkey. It's worth the money, but keep your eyes open while reading it."
1,Low quality .....;((((,In fact this book is only brief conspect of VERY GOOD originaly Sun Solaris documentation. The text contains so lot of mistakes that makes this book ABSOLUTELY useless. The mistakes in the commands formats make you confusing and disoriented...
1,not for the exam,I pass Solaris 7 part 1 89% studying this book & exam cram. This book may be used for reference but not for the exam. It covers uneccessary topics not in the exam objectives and misses neccessary topics. It's very hard to pass w/ this book. Exam cram book is better for part 1.Part 2? I don't know
3,The book is great but don't depend upon the examgear cdrom,"The book has been very helpful in preparing for the certification test. Especially the part one exam. Later it will become a good reference book to keep handy on my shelf. But the examgear testing software is littered with incorrect answers. There doesn't appear to be any way to get any fixes or upgrades to the testing software. There is a website, but no link to get an upgrade. I'm forced to keep refering to other references to find out which is correct, the book or the test."
4,Great book,"I passed the Part II of Solaris Certified System Admin exam last week. I used this book and exam cram to prepare for it. Thought I should get better scores than I actually got. Do not know why. May be questions on Part II are more tricky. But anyway, a pass is a pass.I agree with the previous reader that this book not only prepares you for the exam, it is also an overall great book on Soaris admin."
3,Not good enough,"I passed the Part 1 exam and was looking for a book to help me to pass the part 2 exam. I got this book and I'm a little disappointed, especially on the practice exams. I used the ""study mode"" on one of the chapters and there are only 15 questions. If you have the JavaTutor then you don't need this book."
3,Good Reference Book But ............,"I decided to buy this book prior to attending a Sun Admin course to avoid being totally lost in class.While this book contains a wealth of theory and real-world scenarios, it contains sections that aren't on the exam (backup tools - 'cpio' and 'dd') and a lot of the command options listed in the book weren't stressed on the exams. The way it is organized is a little crazy at times. The actual exam questions come right out of or are based on scenarios used in Sun literature... and that literature is word for word with Man Pages and similar to Answerbooks Best thing to do is PRINT OUT THE EXAM OBJECTIVES to know what you need to know and what you don't, use this book to clarify (and it will) anything you have trouble with. I used this book to better understand and illustrate the topics of the exams objectives, especially Part 2 and passed both."
4,It quite good,"The book is quite good, it covers all of the objective topics with sufficient detail. I suppose it could be enough to pass the exam alone if accompanied with a few sets of practice questions.On the other hand, I have to mention unnecessary repetition of some topics making the reader little bit bored. For example, the problem may be caused by the use of user ids higher than 60000 is mentioned about 5 to 7 times. Anyhow, a minor problem that makes one remember better.Finally, I think the companion CD is great. There are sufficient number of questions (more than 200 for each part). And I especially like the question history options letting you to review the Qs you are bad at or hiding the ones answered correct more than n times.Finally, this is a nice book. And can be purchased especially if one has previous Sol 7 experience and would like to take 7 exam."
4,This is what it is really like to live on a bike for a year.,"Jane is able to effectively relate her experience of bicycling around the country over a year long period. After reading this, I think I know what it's like to ride on an extended tour on a day to day basis. The author is likeable and you can easily relate to her since she seems very ordinary (like most of us).Her book is very encouraging and created a desire to do what she has done"
2,A bit boring,"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, but found it hard to read. I kept falling asleep."
2,Simplistic writing,"I was not able to complete this book because I grew increasingly annoyed with the simplistic writing style of the author. She had a way of making potentially interesting events sound boring. Her voyage was admirable, and the title is excellent, but I didn't like the writing."
5,Excellent and Improved Version,"Text flows well and I was able to ace the course. Great reference to keep in your locker at work for review, too"
2,Neonatal Resuscitation Textbook with CD-ROM,the book was ok. an older version than the one i wanted but it is ok. The Cd was broken and beyound being used. which was a bummer
5,Marvelous Tool,"I bought this tool for my 40-something year old son because he had borrowed mine to do some clearnig around his house. The only way to get mine back was to buy him his own. The ease of use is remarkable, much easier than a chainsaw and quicker, too."
2,like cutting with a hammer,"I've never been so disappointed in a lopper, with its head so bulky that it's nearly unusable. If I'm pruning limbs that are too close together, I have to set this lopper aside and use something that can slip between the branches. I also have to open the handles too wide, reducing their usable length to a foot or less. Useless."
5,Versatile,"I spend a lot of time removing non-native invasive plants, mostly woody vines and shrubs. This tool and a 10"" razor saw are all I carry (plus a screw driver if I'm doing English ivy). I don't need pruners because this can do small as well as large work. I have bad arthritis and find these more comfortable than most. I also have the older, ""18-inch"" model. This one is better and more comfortable, worth the few extra dollars."
5,Easy Cutting,Hello; I bought this based on the customer reviews. I needed a cutter that my elderly (sorry Mom) mother could lift easily and cut with little effort. She called me and said she cut the whole headge down flush with the ground! She said she loves it and can cut through anything. A perfect choice. Thank you to all for taking the time to review it!
1,Fell apart within 2 years,"Two of the four chairs broke in less than 2 years. We didn't jump on them like monkeys. They were only sat on by our small children, not by adults. They simply split and cracked, starting from near the drill holes."
5,Best FB CD!,"This CD has the prettiest Fruits Basket music. It the music from the last three episodes as well as some other vocal songs that weren't in the series. When I first heard this CD I started crying! They also have the full version of the opening song which is a plus. If you love Fruits Basket music, buy this CD now!"
3,Only Japanese,"If you want only the Japanese songs of Fruits Basket, get this CD. the English version of the Opening and End themes is not included. I was disappointed when I bought it because I'm looking for the English ones and can't find it anywhere."
5,AWESOME music!!!!!,"My favorite CD ever! The music is so relaxing to listen to. My favorite song is ""It Makes Me Want To Cry With Reason"". The song fitted Kyo and Tohru perfectly in the last episode. You don't have to be a Fruits Basket fan to buy this CD. I'm sure anyone would like it!"
5,Icemat Siberia Combo,"This is the head set I was looking for. Excellent sound, comfort, and microphone. I use it for music, movies and Skype"
5,EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE MONEY $$$$$,Super Lens! Works Perfect with my Olympus Evolt 300. I you need an extra lens for yours the deal here on Amazon Is ONLY $132.00!WOW! UNBEATABLE! GOT MINE HERE!
3,"Ok, but not as good as their album ""What's Left of Us?""","Find 'What's Left of Us' if you can. It is way better than this one. Don't get me wrong, this one isn't bad, it just isn't particularly memorable. Listen to the samples, if you like it, get it. But then go find and buy What's Left of Us."
1,"Naseous, cacophonous sounds.","I expected this CD to be loud like most punk music, but I didn't anticipate the group's fixation on negativity. While I agree that women's issues are important, going on and on about how evil men are is not going to solve anything. After listening about three times, I felt so naseous. I wonder if men realize that women are human beings. Why aren't offenders like the ones denounced here punished more severely?"
4,"""This Is The Glory Years, With A Different Title & Cover Photo""","The title says it all! ""Prince: In The 1980's"" is a better than average documentary on ""The Artist Who Will Always Be Prince"". Entertaining and informative to be sure, but honestly ""Prince: In The 1980's"" is the exact same documentary as ""Prince: The Glory Years"". The only difference between the two is the title and the cover photograph. If you are a Prince fan, either of the two documentaries would be good to have for your Prince collection...I guess it would depend on which cover photo you like the best. I chose ""Prince: In The 1980's""....I admire the brother's talent and style, but the cover photo on ""Prince: The Glory Years"" is just a little too flamboyant for my taste."
5,The better season,My son loves spongebob and season 3 tends to be favored by him. I'd recommend it to anyone who has kids and needs a distraction for them on the rough days.
2,This is NOT a game - It is a GBA Video!,"This is not a game but the third in the series of SpongeBob Game Boy Advance Videos. These videos are not great graphically but can be entertaining if viewers haven't seen the episodes on NICK multiple times already and if you don't have a DVD player in the car. Otherwise, my kids have watched these once and were done. Save your money and by Spongebob collections on DVD!"
5,Awesome little drive for the price.,The way it retracts and such is really cool. The only downside I can think of is the little puny thread-like string that holds it to your keychain. I picture it snapping off one day... bye bye data. I guess you can beef it up yourself though.
3,Good for the price,"It is a good deal for the price. The blue plastic section slides to protect the device this traveling, but it separated and broke with in the first week. This was easily fixed using super glue, but still think it should be noted. It works, won't blow you away, but good for the price."
4,Great album of one of the greatest guitarists of the world,"Considering 1970 to 1983 period of Peter Green's solo career, this is one of the best albums, only exceeded by ""In the skies"" (released in 1978).""Last train to San Antone"" and ""Got to see her tonight"" are the best tracks, followed by ""Bullet in the sky"" and ""Like a hot tomato"". Also ""Lost my love"" and ""Promised land"" are good songs.This album has a good balance between blues and rock. Definitely recommended."
2,Not great!,"I agree with the others. It took several tries to keep the disc secured. Once I did, the cookies came out fine ... except they all fell apart when I tried to get them off the cookie sheet. Could be the dough recipe, I guess. I was excited about the frosting tips ... except there is no white disc to attach the tips to. I think I bought it on clearance ... not even going to bother to return it. Why torture anyone else."
1,What a waste of time and money!,"I agree with the other bad review. I was so disappointed I didn't even bother trying to take it back. If the tube didn't pop out from one end, it popped out from the other. Really bad product."
1,"Tough, brittle, completely dehydrated, and unsafe.","I bought two bags of these, thinking it was the same product that I used to buy in different packaging (light blue, with a see-through dog shape against a grass green background). Unfortunately, it was completely not the same thing! These treats were actually like jerky-- tough and brittle. I give my dog soft treats because he doesn't chew the damn things, and he choked on these horrible things; I had to toss them out.Note that the ""Zuke's Jerky Naturals"" with the other packaging (http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPY) have always been moist and soft, and I've never had a problem with those. I suspect that this batch was not new packaging, as I had thought, but very old packaging; these may be the same treats I usually feed my dog, just having sat on a shelf for years. In any case, these were COMPLETELY different treats, and not safe to feed my dog."
5,"Tasty and nutricious, the dogs love these snacks","My wife and I don't have a dog, but we often take care of a Boston Terrier and two mixed breed dogs owned by the in-laws. We spoil their dogs rotten, the same as we do their kids when we babysit, and we've found that of all the treats that we've given the dogs, their favorite ones are the Zuke's Jerky Naturals, lamb recipe. They would eat the whole bag in one gulf if we let them. The dogs' veterinarians recommend lamb for their primary source of protein, and we use a lamb recipe dog food when they're staying with us, but they love their snacks, and with Zuke's, they get a healthy snack as well as one they love."
5,Zuke's Lamb Jerky Treats: 2 paws up!,"The Lamb Jerky soft treats are the first product we tried from Zuke's. They were a big hit and continue to be one of my little schnoodle's favorite treats.Soft jerky squares (approx 1"") can easily be split into 3-4 pieces. We use them for her training/play sessions and she seems to especially love it when the reward is the Zuke's soft lamb jerky.Although she performs just as eagerly when the reward is theZuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats, Peanut Butter n' Blueberryzor the Zuke's Mini Bakes Chicken n' Cherry. So I guess we're stickin' with Zuke's."
2,"Ok, but not something they eat with enthusiasm.","My chihuahuas like this treat, but they do not eat it with enthusiasm. They hesitate and let it sit quite often."
5,Good ingredients and my dog loves em,What more can I ask for? Great ingredients and my dog loves these. She'll do back flips for em.. very good. great price too.
5,Candy for Dogs!!!,"Ernie, my pooch, LOVES these treats. He'll do trick or command just to get his Zuke!Seriously, these things will make your dog do anything....so, buy two bags!"
2,My dog likes the ones without the rosemary and herbs - could not find them :-(,My dog's physical therapist somewhere found lamb jerky made by Zukes - but it didn't have the herbs. The herbs are too strong and overpowering for the lamb. Let me know where I can find the ones without the herbs please - and I will order several bags. Thanks!
5,Great quality product!,The first ingredient is beef and they're made in the USA. The company also contributes a portion of their sales to the Dog and Cat Cancer Fund (according to the packaging).My Keeshond-mix loves these treats and I love giving them to her. I can easily break them in to smaller pieces if I want to make them last a little longer (or fit them into her Kong treat toy).The price is pretty good as well as far as dog treats go. I will continue to order this product in the future.
5,Dog A-paw-roved!,My dog's love these treats! Zuke's makes great products and I haven't tried one that wasn't devoured by the dogs and price savvy for my wallet.
4,Pup preferred,"Zukes great company and wide variety of healthy yummy products, will order again and try other items from this company, which I can only do on Amazon."
3,"A Great Program, but won't run on newer Macs","First I must say that Millie's Math House is a wonderful program. It is great for teaching a variety of math skills appropriate to Pre-School and Kindergarten students. This programs covers shapes, size, patterning, one to one correspondence, counting, numeration to 30, and matching. I loved this program as a Kindergarten teacher and I purchased it for my own son.That said, it won't run on my new Mac. On Amazon it stated OS X as the operating system requirements. Not true. This program will run on Windows 95/98, Windows Me, Windows 2000, and Windows XP. On a Mac it will run on Mac OS 7.01 -9.2 and OS X in classic mode. Unfortunately newer Mac no longer run on Classic mode and it is no longer supported. This seems to be true of A LOT of children's software. Looks like I am going to have to set up an older machine for my son. Too sad. I would like he to be able to use more up to date technology."
4,"Sweet doll, but she stinks!","We gave this doll to our daughter for Christmas and she loves the way it glows. It makes her laugh with joy each time she lights up. But I was disappointed in the ""baby powder"" scent of this doll. It was not mentioned in any of the descriptions and had I known it was scented, I don't think I would have gotten it. It's a sweet toy, but if you're sensitive to perfume, look elsewhere."
2,She smells like baby powder,"The doll has a very strong smell of baby powder, almost like she was bathed in it! I guess if she sat outside and got a chance to air out she would be tolerable to be around but for a kid that is sensitive to really strong perfume smells, it isn't good. She gives me a headache!"
4,Product is as advertised.,"The lanyard is not a duplicate of the original, as shown in the photo. It is more of a ""whistle clip"" like you get at a sporting goods store.Other than that, the case and leather skin are of good quality."
3,Split Decision,"I have an e280. This product fits right, but can be annoying. The leather case is tight and looks sharp; but, it makes hitting the main power/menu button (and, to a lesser degree, all the outer buttons) a pain. It's very stable, but doesn't seem to fit perfectly with any armband I have. The hard case is nice, but the times when it's useful are not many (maybe for someone who normally carries their mp3 player in a bag they toss around alot, it would be useful).Overall, good product (screen cover is perfect), good concept, ok in practice."
5,Best case for Sansa E series,If you want the best case for your E series then this is it. Everything fits tight. It comes with a leather cell phone type case and a nice hard case to store you mp3 player. Definitely recommend it.
5,Sandisk 5-Piece Travel Case Kit,I ordered this at the same time I bought my SanDisk E280. The the case and the plastic screen protector fit well. The outside case make it easy to place the unit on your belt. The padding is great to protect your SanDisk.You can also listen to the unit as long as you unzip a small section on the top for the wire. This is a great accessory and would I recommend to all.
4,Sansa Travelling Case,"Good return value for your money. The leather case is very nice and fits perfect. The only problem is that there isn't enough room available to store your head phones with the MP3 player, unless you force them in. Could improve some. Overall it is a good investment and I rate it 4 stars."
2,Not enough room.,"Nice construction, would protect from damage. Might as well forget putting anything in with the player. The ear buds would get crushed and no room for cords. Defeats the purpose in my opinion."
4,Does What It Should,"The case is very nice, and makes my e280 much more likely to survive a fall. The carrying case is very well made, but kind of bulky.I bought a 2nd e280 for my wife, and got her one of these with it because I think that it is an important add-on."
4,Nice case!,"I think it was a nice case and that the extra things that it came with were nice, also. I think it will be handy for traveling except the mini-case that goes around it doesn't give you enough room to push the buttons. Otherwise, It's great!"
4,Gets the Job Done,"Picked this up since it has both a travel case as well as a form fitting leather case. The design is simple and fits the player well, with just a slight amount of slack, since it uses a velcro strap at the top. All the buttons can be accessed, except for the voice recorder, which to me really isn't an issue, maybe so for others. The carrying case is well built with plenty of padding and the provided lanyard & cleaning cloth work well.Pros: Fit, form, and protection are good, cleaning cloth and lanyard are good quality.Cons: Pouch inside carrying case cannot hold much as it will push down on the screen with anything more than the cleaning cloth.Overall this case combo is not to bad a deal for under $20, worth the price to protect your investment."
3,5-Piece Travel Case,Case is OK though it doesn't exactly fit the player tightly. It slips making it difficult to turn the MP3 player on and off. It also overhangs on some parts of the dial making selection difficult at times. We like the lanyard as it has adequate room for shortening/lengthening.
1,Sandisk Inferior company,"Sansa SDMX4 e280 * GB MP3 PLayer. Sandisk failed to deliver on time, failed to supply CD and quick start guide that was advertisted as part of the package order. After three emails & 3telephone calls a CD arrived that looked like something someone made a copy of from a home computer. It arrived without a case, No label, written on with magic marker AND IT DID NOT WORK!!!! I will never purchase anything from sandisk again. This is obviously not a professional company And I am demanding A FULL REFUND!!!!"
1,Amazon can't get their act together,"I would love to rate the product but since Amazon can't get their act together and ship the product I will have to wait.Got an e-mail on 25 June that the item had shipped, they didn't actually ship it until the 29th of June.The item shipped from Capital Heights, MD at the Amazon warehouse (60 miles from my house) but Amazon sent it to New Port News, Va (160 miles from my house) now I have to wait even longer to get the items I paid to have shipped. Called Amazon for assistance and they are sorry (Yeah right) but they don't offer to fix their mistakes ""Sorry we can't help but we apreciate your business and look forward to your next purchase"" Ha doubt I will buy from Amazon again."
5,Sansa E 200 Travel Case,"Product is all what was advertised, I use it everyday, the leather case is a good protector, and when not in use, the zipped case stores and protects my device and earphones"
4,SanDisk Case,OK A little tight. Can't put earphones in without concern for damage to the MP3 player.
5,Great Travel Set,"This is a great set. I love the case. It has a hard exterior and a form fitting interior that keeps the player from moving around inside. The lanyard makes it easy to carry around, and the snug leather jacket for the player makes is both fuctional and fashionable. The set also includes a screen protector and cleaning cloth. This a necessary set for on the go and for storing the Sansa player."
