1,Paid 50.00 Dollars for the same thing at walmart a few years ago!!!,"Paid 50.00 Dollars for I can,t beleive this. 300.00 dollars!!! the mike don,t work that great. you need batteries all the time. and the pictures not that clear. I took mine back. The other review is right save your mony and buy a karaoke machine or use web cam while they sing. the same thing at walmart a few years ago!!!"
2,Money spent better in other places....,Way to much money for this item. And the supporting music is WAY over-priced. There are so many better ways to get your children to sing.
1,Great Idea...Poor Product,"Both our kids love watching home videos of themselves and they also recently started to sing their favorite songs using home made mics, so we came across this toy at a local box store and thought it would be the perfect Santa gift! It's very easy to plug in and start using, but with fresh batteries one of the mics stopped working in under 20 seconds. It also gives off a horrible buzz in the speakers...and you have to have the volume turned all the way up on the base station for the music to be heard. Also...with HDTV being the standard these days, why market a product that has less than great ""standard def"" quality? That doesn't make any sense. With toys like the Wii and X-box, this toy is very sub-standard! A complete waste of $50.00! Do NOT waste your money!!"
1,Please don't waste your money,My daughter got this toy as a gift for her fourth birthday. She played with it once and has never touched it again. What I dislike most about this toy is that you have to buy batteries for it. It has to be connected to the television set why not make an AC adapter as well for it???? The music is also age inappropriate. It's just a total waste of money.
1,all those batteries for poor quality,"I thought this would be a great hit for my son who loves to sing and dance. When opened on Christmas the whole family (cousins included) was so excited....until we had to put in so many batteries, hook it up to the t.v. and man what a disappointment. The picture is so fuzzy it was a little scary to see ourselves like that. Fisher price really let our family down with this one."
1,picture quality is terrible,"This idea has such potential, but as other's have said, the picture quality is so poor that it is hard for the kids to see themselves. You must have perfect lighting and then the kids just have to stand still and sing. If they move around, the picture is blurry. The image on the box is very misleading. Very disappointing!"
1,Don't waste your money on this toy!,"I bought this for my 3 kids for Christmas, ages 3,4 and 5 and I thought it would be the biggest hit but I just took it right back to the store. The picture quality is terrible!!! It is very misleading considering the picture on the box. Even with great light, the screen kept fading to black. I kept thinking it was the batteries (which is also a pain) and after 3 sets of new batteries, it was still doing the same thing. Even when you could see the picture it was awful. The kids really had no interest in it after realizing they couldn't see themselves very well. Also, the sound on the microphone is terrible. Fisher price is usually right on with their quality toys but definitely not on this one..... I wish I had read all of the reviews before even buying it......I hope this saves someone from making the same mistake."
1,"""Santa Disappoints""","What a disappointment! This toy looked like it would be such fun! Santa left it for my 3 kids ages 6,4 & 2. They could not get the volume on the mic to work without having their mouth right on the mic, the picture on the TV was very blurry. ""Santa"" is taking this back, my kids don't even remember this was one of their gifts because they played with it about 3 minutes total. I actually would not even give this 1 star, rather a -3 stars for a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT"
2,No Volume,"OK - I didn't expect too much when I got this product. Just a chance for my daughter to see & hear herself on TV. Well - I guess one out of two will have to do. The microphone didn't work at all for transmitting sound to the TV. It did fine to change the picture effect. Was kind of a bummer for our 4-year old on Christmas morning. I returned it hoping to get another that worked, but maybe I'll just save my money now.Great concept - too bad the execution wasn't half as good."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I bought this for my 3 year old before reading the reviews. What is Fisher Price thinking recommeding this toy with top 40 hits for a 3 year old? Give me a break! When was the last time you got into the car and your child said: 'hey mom, have you heard that new Black Eyed Peas song?' Give me a break! Unless the song is on Shrek or Chicken LIttle...they don't know it!!!! I'm really in awe that a TOY COMPANY can't figure this out! At least give one cartridge appropriate for a 3 year old. On top of that, I agree with the other comments about the picture being grainy. To FIsher Price, if your going to make a product...at least do it right. I'm so tired of all these cheap toys that don't last a week."
4,didn't work right,"i ordered this toy for my son's 5 th birthday and the audio worked only on the tv. they had fun with it, but i have to return it since i couldnt get the image to show up. i had 3 tv's in my house to try it on and they all did the same thing, no image on the tv, but the kids could still sing along. if this really worked it would have been the best toy ever. my sons were all excited about them being on tv... this item is called also fisher price star performer entertainment system. i could not find it on the fisher price website under either names to get help on it. i will call up..."
2,Poor Sound Quality,The Star Station is a fun concept and my daughter and three year old friends love to see themelves on TV but the audio is poor and images are distorted. I advise you to wait to buy this one until the glitches are worked out.
1,A waste of money,"I purchased this toy on sale at Christmas for my 5 yr old daughter. Not only is the video picture quality very poor whether in natural light or room lighting, but the product is wrapped so tightly in hard molded plastic, that it is impossible to return after it is opened. The music cartridge that comes with it has no songs that are recognizable to little kids. I am very disappointed with Fisher Price on this one. I feel like I've been a victim of deceptive advertising."
1,Star Station Songs not age 3 appropriate,We were excited for our daughter to receive the star station for Christmas - as she loves to use a microphone and sing. She has a great time with the star station singing on her own (and not with the Black Eyed Peas!) and watching herself on tv. None of the star station cartridges are age appropriate for a 3/4 year old (well at least not ours) most of the songs she knows are twinkle twinkle and row row your boat. I WISH they would make some cartridges with nursery songs on them so the younger kids can sing along with the music.
3,Kids LOVE it!!!!!!!,"Santa brought this for my 6 and 4 yr old girls. Although I am not thrilled w/ it, the kids love it. It takes 6 ""C"" batteries and only has one microphone so there is a battle over who's turn it is. Come on, has anyone heard of an AC adapter? I hope they come out w/ an adapter that can be retro-fitted to this product and offer additional microphones. I am glad to see that you can use your own music and can videotape. I will try that tonight w/ them."
2,Not Worth The Money,"I was so excited to buy this for my 5 year old after he tried it out in the store. On Christmas morning, the experience was totally different. The picture was awful, my son realized that he had to stay still in order to be seen in the TV (he loves to dance around), and there are no words to the songs. He lost interest within 10 minutes, and has not picked it up since. I will be returning this to the store, which is not something I normally do with toys. He has had more fun with a keyboard and microphone he received as a gift."
2,Not a favorite,"My 4 year old son got this for his birthday. After scrounging around for batteries for it (taking them out of other toys!) we got it hooked up. He really liked playing with the video effects, but when we put the music on he was very disappointed. I don't know what other children listen to, but my kids did not know any of the songs that came on the cartridge and the only one I knew was ""Who Let the Dogs Out"" Where are all the classic kids songs like ""Twinkle, Twinkle"" and ""Old MacDonald""? I tried to find other cartridges with familar songs on them, but they all seem to have Pop sogs on them that my kids just don't listen to. I like the idea of the toy, but I would rather see it come with songs that are appropriate for preschoolers."
1,Stay away from this - very disappointing!!!,"Bought this gadget for my 4 year-old daugther for her birthday. She loves to sing and perform. She was completely bored and disappointed with this thing in just a few minutes. First of all this product requires a total 0f 9 batteries to operate (6 for the base and 3 for the microphone. There is no option to run this with a power adapter, thus is a huge money-drain when you have to constantly buy batteries. Secondly, the microphone is such cheap quality that it was hardly audible. The only way you actually hear the sound is if you completely stick it to your lips and even so, the sound quality is awful. Thirdly, the video quality is very poor. Image is blured and faded for the most part, even on the nicest TV set. Fourthly, it only comes with one music cartridge with only 4 songs in it. You have to spend about $10 more per cartridge and they only have 8 songs.I strongly advise that you don't waste your time or money on this product!"
3,Too Bad the Songs Aren't For Little Kids!,"This toy is a great concept but the songs are far beyond my 3 year olds years. Can't we have some kids songs? If so, the toy would be perfect. Not even one cartridge available with little kids songs =(. Save your money until they figure out how to sell songs the kids know and love at their young age."
1,Don't be fooled!,My son got this toy for Christmas and I discovered it took 6 C batteries. Than the Micro phone took more batteries. The micro phone is a piece of junk. It didn't work unless my son put it up to his mouth like he was kissing it. I was extremely disapointed that I took it back and got him another toy.
4,Fun for pre-schoolers,"I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter for Christmas. I was a little worried because of the negative reviews, but she loves it. The picture may not be exceptionally clear, but it doesn't matter to her. The complaints about the included music do not apply because she loves to sing her own songs and does not even want to try any other music. She knows plenty of songs to sing and perform on her own. Yes, it does use a lot o batteries, but you pretty much know that going into it.So considering this is a ~$50 toy and not meant as high quality video equipment it is great."
1,Disappointed! Terrible toy.,Bought this for my 3 year old - who loves to entertain w. singing and dancing. He was not at all interested. Really disappointed. The video and sound quality on this thing is terrible. Comes out really dark and blurry on your TV. The microphone is bad too - poor design and sound quality. Don't waste your money.
1,Terrible disappointment,"I thought this would be a great gift to buy my 4 year old. It takes 6 C batteries in the base and they drain faster than you can unscrew the battery cover. In the two minutes that it was actually working before the batteries ran out the image was terrible, no color, very grainy and blurry. My daughter was so disappointed. I agree with other reviews, by a kids bop cd and video tape your child. Save your money."
2,Star Station Needs A LOT of Improvements,"I was very disappointed with the Star Station in many ways. I'll start with the good - it is neat that the kids can see themselves on TV and that there is a wireless mic. My daughter was impressed with this ... Buying batteries was ridiculous, though. It is cool that you can make the kids' image different on the screen, too. However. why would a karaoke set not have the words to the songs, and why are these songs that kids don't know? I am going to find the lyrics to the songs that are on the two cartridges we have online, but this just isn't what we thought it would be. It would be much better if the words to the songs came on the screen so parents can sing along, too. This is an overall waste of money, and a tradtional karaoke set would be much better. I would consider this a glorified CD player with only a select group of cartridges people can buy. And, only 8 songs per cartridge?? Don't waste your money!"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this for my 3 year old son because he LOVES to sing and dance--after we hooked it up and got all of the batteries required for it, the microphone doesn't work. Yes, it is what it is but I really expected alot more from this product! I agree with other reviews that a cd player, camcorder and a spoon would be sufficient!! I will be returning this item as well. Also, don't try to reach the consumer line listed in the book because you will never be connected to a representative!"
2,Poor song selections,"Santa brought this for our twin 5 year old boys. They were excitied until they discovered they did not know any of the songs that were being played. We encouraged them to sing just on their own, but that was not very fun. We returned it. At this price, we wanted something they would enjoy."
3,Its just a toy,I have read other reviews and the big thing to remember is its a toy. I wish it had more songs that kids knew other than just pop tunes. Yes the picture quality isnt great but to my 4 year old she is on tv!! We also take the cartridge out and use the radio and she will sing to that or one of her cd's. The head of the machine pivots so that if you cant put it in front of the tv it can be moved. I do however wish it had an a/c jack to save on batteries
1,Don't waste your money,We purchased this for our 4 y/o son and our 2 y/o daughter as a Christmas present. They love singing and dancing around the house so we thought they'd love being on tv. Too bad the picture quality was awful. Not to mention that you have to put the station up on boxes or another item to get it close to the same height as the tv just to make it look somewhat normal. The mic stinks too. You can't hear the kids over the music. We took it back this morning. The kids will have more fun with a video camera and a cd player. Don't waste your money!!
2,"Great idea, but has a lot of kinks to work out..","My 7 year old got this as a present from Santa. Santa thought she'd love it because she's always looking at her reflection in anything and everything that shows it. It took us a while to get it working, we plugged it into the tv but we couldn't get it to play anything for a little bit. The video part came in very clear for us and my daughter was loving seeing herself on tv. The music was way too low and like everyone else says, she didn't know any of the songs. Our biggest problem was the feedback that we kept getting from the microphone. It's not worth the money, but it is a great idea. We told our daughter that it must have been broken during all the bumps in Santa's sleigh. We returned it today and she picked out a better toy that she hasn't but down once since she's gotten it home."
2,Think twice before you buy,My daughter had to have this toy. The picture quality is nothing like what is shown on TV or on the Fisher Price web site. You can barely see the picture on the screen. The extra cartridges are really a rip off. You would be better off using your own video camera and Kareoke machine and CD's. Unfortunately Santa brought this so of course we have to keep it. Which we are doing after we had to exchange it 2 times on the day after Christmas because the microphones weren't working. Think twice before buying this item or save your receipt so you can return it after you realize it doesn't work.
3,Low microphone,"My Daughter received this for Christmas, picture is ok, songs are not long, but the biggest drawback is that the volume of the microphone is not loud enough, and that is at it's highest setting also with brand new batteries. For the price (which is not cheap) I do not think it is up to par."
4,Great Buy!!!!,"My three year old daughter just got this for Christmas today and she loves it. Considering what you are paying for it, the picture is great. My daughter just loves looking at herself in the mirror so you can imagine how much she likes this. The only improvement I would reccamend is selling cartridges with toddler music on them. Which makes more sense if you targeting an age range starting at three years old. I would definitly reccamend this toy to all my friends."
1,"very bad, dissapointing","my son got this for Christmas from my inlaws, yesterday December 20. we opened the box, hooked it up and from the begining it did not work. there was static until we placed the microphone ontop of the receiver. . . which is not what you are suppose to do! all he could do was dance to the music, which by the way had poor sound quality too! we are returning this product as soon as we can. too bad he would have loved it!!!"
2,Star Station Performance,We purhcased this toy for our daughter for her 5th birthday because she likes to sing and dance and returned it two days later. The quality of the picture on the tv was awful and she knew only one song from 6 cartridges. I returned it and purchased some things that she is really enjoying now!
1,saddened,"We bought not one but two of these systems. We hoped- being a fisher price toy- that the first one just wasn't working correctly. This was not the case. The picture is extremely cloudy . Even with new sets of batteries, again, two sets just to be sure, the system didn't work. The packaging is very decieving. Not at all the happy faces at play at our daughters 4th birthday party."
3,This is Fun - wish it wasn't battery powered,"My 4 year old got this for his recent birthday and he enjoys singing and seeing himself on tv (he doesn't mind that the image is not great). Two things that could make it better would be having an AC adapter rather than needing batteries and having cartridges with kid songs - wheels on the bus, etc. The ""dance songs"" are too sophisticated for my son so he usually just sings his own songs and we turn the cartridge off."
1,Too much trouble for the price.,"My 3 year old son saw this displayed at the store and loved it. We thought it would be the perfect gift for his 3rd birthday but we were sadly mistaken.We put in the batteries in the main camera, and the batteries in the microphone(all brand new). By the next day the batteries were dead on the microphone and we only turned it on once. The main camera system was half used up and we only turned it on once.Hook up: We found that you need a tv with the hookups in the front for easy hookup. If you only have a choice of one video and not all the extras like video one, two etc and you have a dvd player you will need to unhook the dvd player to get the system to work."
3,Needs better songs,"I bought this for my son's fourth birthday. All 3 of my kids (one older, one younger) fight over it anytime it's on- but they only know one song from all the cartriges (You've Got a Friend in Me- Toy Story). We wound up just putting a CD player next to the TV and playing their own music while they could still watch themselves.I agree with those who said the picture quality is bad. On mine, it messes with the color- takes the blue out of everything, so anything black looks kind of dark greenish, anything blue looks grey, etc. I think it's wierd, but it doesn't phase the kids and if they had more ""younger kid"" friendly songs, we'd probably like it a whole lot more. Like more soundtrack songs from the Disney movies, Wiggles songs, Preschool songs, etc."
1,Big Waste of Money!,"My daughter wanted this for Christmas, so I searched and searched for one. I wish I had not wasted the time or money! The commercials for this make it seem so enjoyable, but my daughter played with it for 10 minutes and then pushed it aside. The picture quality is horrible, the songs are all muffled, the mic has to be right at their mouths, and the songs on the cartridges are for 30 year olds, not 4-7 year olds. I bought 2 extra cartridges and those both stink too. Don't waste your money on this big disappointment."
2,Fisher Price needs to read these reviews and go back to the drawing board!,"Just bought this today at Toysr'us. I had gone in to exchange a few Christmas gifts and it was on display and looked like a really fun toy for my daughter and son. They love singing and looking in the mirror etc. so I thought they would love seeing themselves on tv. I should have read these reviews first! The picture is grainy...not completely horrible but I could get better with my camcorder. My biggest complaint is the batteries.....it should come with an adapter. Also, the music cartridges don't have appropriate music for a three year old..they need more toddler-type music available instead of songs from the radio etc. This toy could be so much better...I hope they get the message from all of the returns and make some improvements!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This item may have been more enjoyable for my 2 year old if it had songs he knows like twinkle twinkle or old mcDonald. He new none of the songs, and the picture quality was terrible. We returned this item to the store. It is not worth the money. It is a shame too because we bought it after our son got such a kick out of seeing himself in a video camera monitor at the store. Maybe Fisher Price will try this again with better quality picture and songs more for a toddler."
2,WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY!!!,"I bought this product for my 4 yr old daughter for Christmas 2006. I was so excited for her because she really loves to see herself on camera. Every time we go to the grocery store, we have to walk in front of the camera three or four time so she can see us on the monitor. I would've been better off just taking her to the grocery store more often. The visual quality of this item is extremely poor. The television commercial portrays this crystal clear visual that the actual product doesn't come anywhere close to, not to mention the fact that my daughter, didn't know half the songs on the cartridges. I had to keep adjusting the screen to try and get a good picture, but I never really did. It's a year later, Christmas is a month away, and this ""Piece of Crap"" toy looks just as Unused as the day I took it out of the box. I wasted my money, but hopefully, you'll save yours."
1,"Star Station Not ""A Star""",I was excited about this toy when I saw the video on the web site. We bought one for our daughter and one for my nephews. I have never been more disappointed with a Fisher Price toy. This is terrible. The picture quality is bad. You can hardly hear a child's voice in the microphone. The background music in the actual Star Station is not very loud either. The music on the cartridges is not for the preschool set (the recommended age for the toy). My daughter has only heard a couple of the songs and doesn't know the words well enough for those two songs to even sing along. If I could give this toy negative stars I would. I'd return it too if my husband hadn't already thrown out the box.
2,Save your money,"My 2 1/2 year old son got this from grandma for Christmas. The picture quality was extremely poor and distorted. Had good overhead lighting as the instructions suggest, but no dice. I am returning this promptly!! Thumbs down to Fisher-price."
1,Huge Disappointment,I was really excited for my kids to open this for Christmas and get a chance to play with it. However we were very disappointed when we actually plugged it in. First of all it was difficult to get the cartridges in far enough for them to play and worst of all you could not see the kids clearly on the tv...even when we added extra light (which is really inconvenient for everyday) we still could not see them clearly. The image on the box does not accuratly portray the clarity and brightness that you will get on your tv. I returned this to the store right away. What a waste...
5,This is going on your permanent record!,"Could you ask for a funnier movie? Killer cast, great gags... Definetly more in the ""comedy"" genre than the ""horror comedy"" genre, nothing in here is really going to scare you, but if you're looking for a great laugh, look no further!Great production value for an indie flik, well written, well acted, the only problem with it is some of the timing, laugh moments come so quick and often, I had to rewind it a couple times cause my friends were still laughing when the next bit came at them!If you have a sense of humor, and are looking for a bit of a different take, please take the time to add this to your cart, you won't regret it!"
1,avoid this move,"i wrote a long review but somehow i lost it.'netherbeast inc.'- it's on the level of a poorly made tv comedy [that really doesn't make you laugh.vampires hide in a corperation. they've been doing it for so long that they bicker. the ceo vampire has a brain disease like alzheimers. he hires an outside consultant [industrial psychologest or sociologist] to bring back morale. now who's killing fellow vampire employees, why kill them, and is this all just to take over the ceo's position??? can a vampire and mortal fall in love??? the real answer, based on this movie, will be: 'who cares. give me my money back!'david foley [whom i really like, deserves better roles] is as two dimentional as the other charactors.i see that there do exist 7 people that think this is an 'okay' movie. good for them, at least somebody made a movie they could enjoy. you're probably not one of them."
5,Just what I needed to continue on my journey,"Reading Karens book just when I needed the reassurance that I could be that person that could dream and knew it was okay,to make my own choice in how to live my life the best that I can. Learning to let go of my past and make decisions that are best for me. I love how she has put her own slant and interputation on others quotes. It puts things in perspective and guides you thru your lifes journey. I have given this books to friends and I refer back to it quite often. Its diffently a keeper."
5,"Meaningful yet not ""preachy""","Here are some of Ms. Wrights words: Rather than asking, ""Why is this happening to me?"", instead ask, ""Why is this happening for me?""...Changing one word (in that question) has changed your entire relationship with the unknown.The Sequoia Seed works for me and I submit that it will work for you, too.I am a busy working mom and as much as I'd love to read volumes each day, time just does not permit. This book is a concise and practical gem. I carry Karen's words with me through personal and professional journeys.Ms. Wright suggests that you revisit the book time and again, that you'll see things you will swear weren't there before. I can already attest to this.Enjoy The Sequoia Seed!(I have also bought copies to present as gifts.)"
2,"Just plain goofy, not worth the money spent","What can I say? I guess I was looking for some ground pounding Primus like material. Instead I get some goofy guys dressing up like some DEVO rejects putting out crappy music. The video looks like it was shot by a third grader and the sound is like some second grader recorded it on a walkman tape player. I am sorry I spent the money on this. Les, you got me on this one. I really dont know what happened to you, but please re-visit the Primus albums, and take a listen. The only saving grace is the bass playing is still good in most parts. Les, you really ""jumped the shark"" on this one."
3,Not Bad,The Grip coach training grip is very usefull. I have used it finally and find it easy to change from club to club. I give it three stars because I have had a similar one in the past from another manufacturer and lost it. I was hoping this one would have been more like this first one I bought but it still works just fine. long straight shots again from a hacker.
3,Helpful essays,"A collection of essays well worth reading. D. A. Carson's chapter on imputation is especially helpful. I can't resist, however, pointing out an inexcusable omission for an academic book: no indexes! No Scripture index; no person index; no subject index. Very strange and frustrating."
3,I liked the debate between Carson and Gundry,"""The current reviewer's opinion is that the most important essays in this volume are the ones written by Carson and Gundry. At the end of the day, the debate over justification is a debate over Paul, and this is precisely what their essays discuss. It is interesting that so little of the volume addresses the debate on the so-called 'New Perspective' on Paul. There will be a Copernican revolution in conservative systematics and biblical theology if this new paradigm carries the day. Thus, we would like to have seen more interaction on this subject. Nevertheless, this volume is useful in setting forth a variety of contemporary perspectives on this seminal doctrine.""h t t p : / / d e n n y b u r k . b l o g s p o t . c o m"
2,trackless chapters and the voice ruined it,"First of all, the audio recording does not track with the chapters of the book. Pretty hard to read with a group and impossible to go back pick up where you left off.Dan Cashman, ""the voice"" of audio book, just about KILLED all of the jokes in the book. I had to turn up my volume to almost max to hear ""the voice"" in my car. Save your money and get the paperback! Or better yet just rent it on amazon.com"
4,abba's child,It was a good book. I would recommend this book to other who want to find Christ. It has a great faith link.
5,Lost Faith in the God who once loved you???,"Ok, then this is the book for you. I actually purchased this one on the cd set... and wow... what an awesome, intense & passionate series. After several listens, and once on a personal quiet retreat... this served up just what was needed. It does start slow, and is filled with intense, intellectual verbage, and you may need to remember it is worth the digging through to get to the meat. I have shared this with my entire family, and highly reccomend it to anyone who may have forgotten how dear, how precious & how much our Father in heaven loves us. Be prepared for a journey into your faith.. again... If you have lost hope in the God of creation... enjoy this journey with Manning. It will bring back into the arms of a loving Father... Indeed, you are Abba's Child!"
4,Abba's Child,This was a terrific book. On the heels of The Shack as well as The Spirituality of Imperfection.This book provides much needed perspective and insight.s
4,Unlike the Workaday World!!,"This is what we all need - to get away from it all, and spend the solid, intimate time with God. Alone, without distractions! Isn't that what our Father in Heaven wants - to worship Him in Spirit and Truth. And when we return from whatever contemplative situation we may find, we are refreshed and able to gain the spiritual strength which the workaday world requires. As long as we do this, Manning, suggest, we are ""plugged into"" the Ultimate Source. A provocative read, and for those who are so inclined, it is highly recommended!!!"
4,Solid,"This book is easy to review, quite simple actually, and it can be done in one sentence: This solid book will not allow you to reject the fact that God loves you unconditionally.There is a lot more to say about this work, but really it is all summed up in the last sentence. Manning consistently writes eloquently for the masses who are hurting, broken, and need love. He is honest with his own journey and leaves no detail spared of his own personal trials and tribulations. He gives hope to those who might not have any hope, and joy to those who might think they have to be perfect for God to love them. I appreciated the honesty from the author, and the risk he takes in sharing his soul with the reader. Not many authors are willing to do this where it will make a difference, Manning obviously will.This book is a must read for anyone wondering if anyone cares about what happens in their life, read the book, find out why God loves you. Seems pretty simple to me."
5,Under Conviction,"If you are one who doesn't understand how radical God's love must be, Manning will straighten you out. I'm learning that God's love is ferocious and tenacious. As a Christian, our love is intended to be the same. We are called to love painfully - with risk of disappointment and with disappointment fulfilled. Love must hope, trust and endure even when we don't see how. But we are the ones who let us down the most.By bringing me to a greater awareness of my brokeness, this book helped me in a struggle with how to be compassionate to those who's lives have been broken - who have been rejected and cast out by family, friends and even the church. Lesson one, whether you believe it or not, you ARE broken - and your sins are not less than anyone elses. This is basic Gospel that is forgotten by many Christians (discerning by our actions)."
1,Bad News,"I started reading the 1st chapter and did not finish it. He quotes a mystic and then 3 or 4 pages later he talks about a spirt guide. This is not the true gospel of Jesus Christ!!!The first chapter has to do with a type of meditation that scientology uses.Do not be decieved!!!Jesus loves you and you can accept Christ as your savior right now. The steps to eternal life are for you.1. Tell God that you are a sinner and that you cannot earn eternal life.2. Tell God that you believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on the cross for you.3. Ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins and to live in your heart through His Holy Spirit.4. Commit your life to love and serve Him.5. Thank Him for you new salvation.A bible study I have found to be very helpful is called, ""Beth Moore, Breaking Free"" It's wonderful how she brings the brokeness of self with the Word of God.It truly is a acurate bible study of the truth of God's Word. I went through the study myself and found it to be very helpful."
1,Disappointment,"An oversimplified and unrealistic treatise on how to gain intimacy with God. I have not read any of Manning;s previous works and am not planning to having read Abba's child. The main premise of the book is in seeking solitude in order to gain intimacy with God. Manning himself escaped to a cabin in Colorado with nothing but the Bible. I, unfortunately, am not a bestselling author and cannot drop out of life so easily to contemplate the Word. A disappointment that fails to rise above other unoriginal mass market Christian self help."
4,VERY ENCOURAGING,"THIS BOOK GETS TO THE ""NITTY-GRITTY"" ~ SO ""COMFORTING"" THAT SOMEONE ""ELSE"" HAS RECORDED THAT WHICH I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT I WAS THE ""ONLY ONE!!"" IT'S CONTENT IS ""SOLUTIONARY"" & GIVES HOPE~ DOES NOT LEAVE YOU ""OUT ON A LIMB."""
4,And the two shall meet.,"This is a great book, I've read it many times. Amy heads off to wilderness camp with Tasha and Eric, ready for a week full of sports. She gets a little more then sports. She meets a mysterious guy who she feels drawn to. Then when dangerous things start to happen, Amy finds out more then she wants to know about her leader Dallas. A must read for any Replica fan."
2,Defective wheel lead to deterioration in function,"I've had a similar one of these before, from a different company, but this one kinda sucked. It worked OK for about a week or two. Then it started to feel like the wheels were always dragging, even though they were clear of all debris. I've figured out that it doesn't seem to click into the open position all the way for some reason. So, unless I have something heavy on it, the wheels start to collapse. And even when I do have a load, the wheels cause a big drag. Really frustrating."
4,"Very lightweight, does what it's designed to do.","This product works very well for what its intended for. Its extremely lightweight and seems to be durable. There is some plastic parts on this product but I can't see anyone breaking it unless your extremely rough on it. (Maybe running it over with a vehicle will do it.)My only complaint is the support plate is a little shallow. I'm thinking about welding a aluminium extension to it because I use my hand truck for carrying my tools in plants that I work in. My bag barely fits on the stock plate, but for most people's uses I don't think it will be a problem.As for storage, for me it couldn't be better. Its aluminium so it won't rust, and I keep mine behind my toolbox in the back of my truck. It works great for my needs and I think as far as storage it will be great for most users.All in all I recommend this product to everyone who needs a lightweight, collapsible hand truck."
4,Great for Babies and Toddlers,"We ordered this for our daughter's first Christmas a year and a half ago, and she STILL enjoys playing with this toy. The clickety noises, the colorful characters, and the silky taggies keep her entertained."
3,blah,"My son didnt really seem to be intrested in this toy. I bout it for him for christmas , 4 months ago...Still hasnt got much use. Isnt much to do with the toy..."
2,Disappointed...,"We got my 6 month old son this toy for Christmas and he doesn't like it. I thought he would like the tags on it as he likes to chew on the ribbon of another toy but he didn't even notice the toy. Maybe it was just my kid, but I think the toy is better for younger babies or not at all. I would save your money and by something else..."
2,Taggies no good,"I bought this product for my son, and he did not like it. He has not played with it once. He looks at it and throws it away. The toy is now collecting dusk in my basement. Good product I'm sure, but no lights or sound makes baby bored easily. My sons plays more with the taggies books."
1,WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD,I SENT AN EMAIL SAYING I GOT THIS PRODUCT BY MISTAKE AND THEN I LET THEM KNOW IDID NOT RECEIVE IT I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT IT WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT.
5,Brilliant,"Classic of melodic metal and one of the best fruits of Brazilian metal ever. The lead singer, Andre Mattos, went on to a great carreer on Angra and now Shaman."
2,Bad production,"Bad production destroyed an otherwise good intention by these guys from So Paulo, Brazil. The songs are good, although there's no innovation at all. You can listen clearly that they're Maiden fans which bought guitars to copy the master (or try, at least). Proof of that is Viper's posterior career, which went nowhere, reaching the point where they began to sing in Portuguese..."
1,SOLDIERS OF NOWHERE,"If you wanna know VIPER, stick to their second album, THEATRE OF FATE. This debut here lacks in production and is just a copy of every imaginable heavy metal cliche they could remember to use at the time."
5,wonderful astrological book on relationships,"like all of martin schulman's books, karmic relationships is concise and in-depth at the same time. the brief and descriptive paragraphs schulman writes on each aspect is filled with insight. once again, you cannot go wrong when you decide to purchase this book to learn more about how you relate with another person. keep in mind that the book discusses specific synastry chart aspects between two people so keep the chart in one hand and the book in the other to gain insight and wisdom in your own relationships!"
5,Perfect for all experince levels!,"Now here is a book for everyone! ---- easy to read, great examples and useful tips! One of the most effective books I have read. It can be put into use right away -- with the grace and speed of a cheetah!"
3,"Stunning Scenery, Somber Story","A bleak book that was difficult for me to finish. While the author sketches the landscape wildly beautiful in its austerity and the book seems very well researched, the characters are somewhat flat and unreachable. While the writing is fine, the story drags and becomes oppressive. Tragedy, betrayal, abuse, selfishness and hopelessness abound. The ending is a bit of surprise, but still grey and dull. Let me recommend Lillian Beckwith's wonderful books if you are wanting a more upbeat (though hardly glamorized) glimpse of the Scottish Isles."
4,"Fabulous Price, Fabulous Coat","This coat is exactly what I was looking for: a beautiful winter white coat that is warm and elegant. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the coat, at such a great price! I definitely recommend this coat to anyone who is looking for a warm, beautiful, coat that goes with everything!"
5,Ms. Carrolls' Class Book Review,In this story Arthur couldn't find a turkey. The best part of the story was when he found a turkey. We learned that at Thanksgivintg we can have fun like Arthur. Arthur was very funny in this story. Our favorite part of the story was when Arthur was a turkey and then everybody else became a turkey. We think that everyone should read this book because it has lots of funny pictures in it.
5,Kickin' ass!!!,"This DVD proves that today's metal ain't metal at all. Just when I thought thrash was dead... it has raised it's ugly head and shows the world who is boss. If you compare this to anyone else that is supposedly metal these days, I don't think they could hold a flame thrower to the ""legacy "" these boys from the Bay area have. All the best songs are here. All the original members play on all of the tracks, except they do change drummers from Louie Clemente to John Tempesta. Not to run on much longer... If you thought thrash ruled in the late 80's / early 90's pick this up and see that it still rules today."
5,Testament Live In London,"This is the business, to see all the old crew back together once more cranking out the wickedest tunes, if you are a Testament fan, you have to buy this DVD. I saw these guys and was lucky enough to meet Chuck at Nijmegen in Holland back in 2000, they were awesome then, and they are awesome now."
1,Error in the disk,The company who made this disk should have made sure all the answers were right. My daughter was very frustrated that she could not move onto the next section because she had the answer right but there was no correct answer to be selected. So she could not move on. we had to skip the question just to move on. I thought I had already gave a review for this product but here it is in my account again. I guess they were hoping I would change my mind...nope! Did not like the game.
3,Quick summary vs how to,"replacement window section is very brief, which was surprising since this should be the most read section of a how to book on windows. Instructions include using obscure tools for a beginner such as sill-bevel gauge??? Is this a level? Three sentences instructing you to check the sill, side and jambs are level but no detail on how to do it. Why is this important - your window won't seal properly if it is done wrong. The rest of the book progresses the same. Must be a better how to book."
5,Great Book,"Bought this book to help my wife and I to teach us how to remove and install new windows and doors. So far from what I have read, this is a great book! Lots of pictures and detailed instructions."
4,Good Resource,"A good reference for the DIY'er for windows, doors, skylights and entryways - including steps, tile and glass choices. Plenty of pictures, walk and talk through, with enough step by step to be able to get a good idea of what you are trying to accomplish. Will also give you enough information to keep your contractor honest."
5,Another excellent outing,"Record label troubles have seen this slice of wonderful American folk/rock unreleased in its native land for over three years, but thanks to places like this here website, you can get it relatively easily. Well worth checking out!"
5,Fun time for my children,"I bought a set of English Time for my two sons aged 7 and 10. Both just love it! I spend an hour myself with the boys frequently. And I love it too. English Time offers learning the language with fun. Each unit consists of modules e.g. Conversation Time, Practice Time, Phonics Time. So the kids can learn speaking, vocabulary, grammar, and vocalization -- all related to a short unit scene. What my kids love the most is the songs that put the unit materials into an enjoyable tune. English Time comes with the CDs. Highly reccommended."
3,DIRTY OLD DAD,"A KISS SO DEADLY has so many things wrong with it, I find myself surprised to give it three stars. Overall, I found myself enjoying the premise, although it's fairly obvious early on what's going to happen. The scriptwriter throws in an obvious red herring, but once the movie picks up, it becomes pretty evident who the murderer is. Charles Shaughnnessy's character is so unlikeable, it's easy to overlook his character, and focus on the younger ones. Deedee Pfeiffer does a credible job as his daughter and Charlotte Ross as the vixen Amanda is quite good. Kerrie Keane does a good job as Shaughnessy's puzzled wife. Even with its erratic pacing and derivative context, it still manages to be okay entertainment."
3,Just average,"A father (Charles Shaughnessy) enters into an affair the his daughter's friend (Charlotte Ross, who is actually the seducer in the relationship). When she ends up murdered, he goes into overdrive trying to keep the illicit affair a secret from his wife and daughter. The premise is okay, the acting passable... The storyline wouldn't be so disturbing had Ross not portrayed Shaughnessy's daughter for six seasons on ""Days of Our Lives"" ... ick! Plays occasionally on Lifetime Movie Network, so save your money."
3,Only as a reference.......,"I hate to see that the price on this book is so low now! I bought this on import many years ago when it first came out. In fact, my version has a picture of Gorgoroth on the cover instead of the picture of the now-departed Astennu of Dimmu Borgir on the cover. I paid like $60.00 back then, only because I was in a black metal frenzy at the time!! I can only reccomend this as a reference guide, if you need to know what songs are on what album. That's what it primarily gives, the little information it gives about the artists is usually mispelled and incorrect! Now that most people have the internet at thier disposal this book is really rendered obsolete. Although, there are a few choice live pictures courtesy of Martin Wickler. Caveat Emptor!!"
3,Action,The movies in this movie pack are all older movies. Some decent and others that are not decent. Would not purchase again.
3,Not the same filter,I have used Bio Bags for years in my fish tanks and here lately they have changed the mesh pocket I suppose to save money but it does not last near as long as they used too. When the main system burns out I will not be replacing it with a Whisper for the simple fact of the changes with the filters.
5,Wisper Filters,These wisper Bio-Bag filters are great and very easy to use. I received the filters on time and at a good price. Amazon.com Is my favioret place to shop. They have the very best prices and the biggest slection.
4,how to cook husbands,Such a cute little quick read. A friend got me this book as a wedding present - just because of the title - but it is a really cute book to read. Don't judge it by the year it was written it's a classic.
4,A Cute Work,"I've only read the preview so far, but it was enough to entice me to want to finish the book. It's seems to be about relationship advice, for women regarding husbands. It's done from a first person viewpoint, as the author recounts experiences and advice she's received. Overall lighthearted, with the ability to provoke thought, it's certainly a charming piece for the time. I'll admit that it holds sound advice that can be used and applied for today's relationship as well."
1,Bait and Switch,"I picked this CD up thinking that some BOC would be nice to have. Not their greatest hits but it looked OK. Don't buy this CD, not even used, it is not worth the effort of putting it in your CD player! Non-original versions of songs, bad recordings of the originals. I traded this one in as soon as I could. Go with Workshop of the Telescopes if you want a true BOC hits collection."
1,"Why isn't there an option to enter ""0"" stars?","To be fair, I only listened to tracks 12 and 13 (""Godzilla"" and ""Don't Fear the Reaper""). So...my 0 star rating applies to just those two tracks. It sounds like when yer playing guitar hero and you aren't playing well and the crowd starts booing. Godzilla is played way too slow: the guitarist is clearly playing some other song and we're pretty sure the drummer was trying to scare off a roving cat or possum. The singer has 2 minutes of pointless banter at the beginning of the track and throughout this crunchy jam session is totally tripping out on his own voice effects. ""Don't fear the reaper"" doesn't even sound like they're playing it...I think the other review was right...I think that IS Steve Winwood playing an organ while the drummer chases the cat off his kit and the guitar player plays way too fast. Awful. We're keeping it only so we have something to play to clear out unwanted guests."
1,Suspicious,"The battery went in easily and worked fine until it came time to recharge it. At which point it decided it was ""too dead"" to recharge and no amount of coaxing would get it charged again. We plugged it into an ac charger, and onto a radio pod docking station and everyother trick the forums suggested. I am stuck at square one again having to buy another battery. I probably wont look for the cheapest one this time. I suppose you get what you pay for."
4,washing machine pan,"The product is very good at what it does, hold water. It is not so high it will be obvious it is there and the size is perfect for my machine. Be sure you get the right size."
5,super,Product was shipped super fast and was exactly as described. Have been using for about a month now with no issues.
2,Too Small,"This may have worked well but was too small. The dimensions giver were 30"" x 32"" but that is for the outside dimensions. You may want to deduct about 1 1/2 inches for the inside dimensions (a 32"" washer wil not fit in this 32"" pan). My washer would not fit (inside is also rounded). Considered returning it but gave it to Habitat. Had it marked up from trying to get the washer inside."
5,perfect size for newer front loaders,This Camco 32x32 inch washing machine pan is perfect for the footprint of most front-loaders these days. The washing-maching pan that I got from HomeDepot and Lowes was just too small for my Samsung front-loader.
1,great for all ages and safe,"We played with these balls at our church for fun with the scouts and girls activities. Anyone who got hit was not hurt, even to head. We absolutely love these and find them fun for all ages. Even adults get into it. Great for parties. Good way to get out your aggression safely. Lots of running and laughing"
2,"Adequate polish, but lingering odor.","The scent for this is rather overpowering for the scent-sensitive wife. It's reminiscent of a cherry or almond scent mixed with baby powder. The baby powder note is the strongest and the most headache-inducing, it seems.The polishing action is adequate, but the lingering, cloying scent will keep us from purchasing this product again."
5,Love this stuff,Wood for good smells so good! It makes my furniture shine. I love using it knowing that it's all natural. The only con is that you have to shake it really good before using or it will come out thick.
4,"Not very believable, but loved in nonetheless","One of my favorite classic Delinsky novels. You absolutely have to suspend reality for this one, but I had no problem doing so. Loved the cozy feel of this book - makes me think of sitting near a fire with hot cocoa on a cold, snowy New England night."
1,Bad even for a romance novel,"I picked this audio book up on a whim at the library, listened to half of the first tape and gave up (after the nine-hundredth mention of the color of a character's eyes...). The writing was cliché and angsty it set my teeth on edge. I couldn't even stand to listen to it. This is one for the ""avoid at all costs"" pile."
3,Not bad not great,Unit came without hardware but seller was kind enough to send out.There is no clear coat finish and the paint rubs off.I wouldn't use this unit with any good quality swords right out of the box as is.Needs clear coat on it and some soft pads as well where the swords would rest on the stand.
3,"Sturdy, but splitting.","Pros:SturdyHolds 3 swordsCan be used as stand or wall-mountedCons:Out of the box you get 4 pieces, and 0 screwsStarted splitting on back of right side piece (used thin 1 inch screws)feels, looks, and sounds (when splitting) like composite woodConclusion:Acceptable, if due to affordability. It may be composite wood, and it may be splitting a little, but it is heavy, and it is sturdy; if for the time being."
1,Mine is Defective,"I have had this printer for almost two months. Soon after purchase, it started having problems picking up paper out of the tray and instead gave ""out of paper"" error messages. I have tried different kinds of paper, done all the suggested manual fixes and talked to the HP live chat service rep. Nothing has helped and the problem has only gotten worse. I gather I am not the only one having this problem with this printer.The printer prints quickly with good quality prints when it works, but if it won't pick up the paper, that's a moot point.Now it rarely feeds the paper automatically. I have to try and push it into the print rollers manually. I am going to have to return it to HP. This is a real problem because I also use it for small but important print jobs for my small business. I should not be having a major problem like this so soon after purchase."
1,Disposable Printer,"Initially I liked this printer. However after a year and half I find that I will have to throw it away. Printer jammed and when I called HP the cost to repair was so high I might as well buy a new one.Ink usage is terrible, especially when printing pictures.Diffinitely Thumbs Down on this HP Printer"
1,The worst printer,"I bought this printer to do heavy cardstock printing and it is by far the worst printer I've ever owned by HP. Don't get me wrong, I love HP Products. It prints nice pictures but the feed mechanism is horrible - does not feed properly. Maybe you will get a few lightweight papers through the feed if you're lucky. Don't get this printer."
1,Worst printer I have ever owned,"I have owned several HP printers and have always been impressed. The 8250 however is the worst printer I have ever owned by far. It tells me it is out of paper when it is not. It pulls ten sheets of paper or more at a time. It will just stop halfway through a print job and I have to turn it off to reset it. It will print one page of a print job, then spit out four or five blank sheets before printing another page.HP still does not have Mac OS drivers for it, so if I want to use the photo paper drawer I have to print from a CF card. After several attempts with HP customer service, they basically told me they didn't want to and couldn't help since I am a Mac user and it works fine with PCs.As I have said already, I have had several HP printers in the past and have always been impressed, but this is most certainly my last HP."
1,Hands Down the Worst Printer I Have Ever Used,"It's hard to know even where to start with this printer.*Will not print, even in black and white, when one color is out of ink*Will not print when ink is ""expired""*Gives constant pop up notifications on screen and on the printer that ink is expired, soon to be expired, or low* Jams frequently"
2,Poor Reliability,"While I agree the photo quality is outstanding with this printer, mine failed after fewer than a dozen uses. The photo tray stopped feeding 4x6 paper, even after spending $25 on an HP paper feed cleaner designed for this model. To make matters worse, the replacement offer from HP is slightly worse than buying a brand-new HP 8250 printer direct from Amazon. On the plus side, HP customer service was extremely patient while I hunted for my misplaced receipt to prove warranty eligibility (which I couldn't). Ouch! UPDATE: The next day I finally located my receipt, but the 1-year warranty had expired by 10 days. HP would not honor the elapsed warranty and charged me the full replacement amount ($99) for another printer. Pretty chintzy."
1,Extremely poor print paper feed!,"I purchased this printer, hoping that it would AT LEAST work part of the time! I have yet, (in the 2 years that I have had this pathetic printer!) to print any photos employing the so-called ""photo tray."" It simply DOES NOT WORK!!! The print paper (H.P.'s highest quality and most expensive paper!) simply does not feed at all. And when you use the main tray....using anything but full sized paper..the message comes back that the paper is too small. All in all...A TOTAL WASTE OF $300+ DOLLARS! And the live help...is totally useless!Whatever you do...AVOID this printer at all costs. I teach medical students, and many of them have had the same problems with this H.P. model. Try Canon...but avoid H.P.!Dr. Doug"
1,HORRIBLE,"This printer is absolutely terrible. First off, I had to send my back the first week, and I received a refurb after that. The printer ""uses"" colored ink even when only printing in black and white, so that you have to replace the color cartridges even though you aren't using them. If you're out of pink ink, you can't print in black and white, what a scam. I replaced all of my cartridges and only printed in black and white since then, yet I'm somehow running out of yellow, blue, pink ink a few weeks later. When I realized that I couldn't print in black and white without having all the color cartridges in, I went out and bought another brand and will never use another HP printer again. The printer is basically designed to get you to buy a bunch of ink you don't need. I'm convinced the printer will tell you that your color cartridges are empty when they're really not."
1,Waste of my hard earned money!,"For some reason I can only put down to insanity, I bought this printer after my beloved Epson died (after many years of trouble free use). This printer constantly claims to be out of paper, no matter how I load the paper tray. Do a Google search and see how many other people have this same problem! And HP tech support is apparently in Guadalajara! BAH! I'll take my lumps, throw this piece of garbage in the land fill, and buy something else (NOT HP)."
1,HP Photosmart 8200 - Inefficient and a waste of money,"If this newer HP is anything like its predecessor, the 8200, save your money! It goes through expensive to replace color ink in an amazingly short time and depletes the color cartridges even when you are using the Black Only setting! It's difficult to determine just which cartridges are getting low, and if even one goes out, the printer refuses to print.I gave up and bought a Brother."
2,NOT COMPATIBLE!,"I purchased this printer a few years ago at Staples after being convinced by the sales person. The printer worked great. My family, friends and I were amazed of the quality. I was working with windows ME. Once my computer crashed, I purchased a new computer with windows ""Vista."" This is when I began to experience difficulty. It appears that this printer is not compatible with ""Vista."" The program appears to have conflicts with ""Vista."" I am considering purchasing a new printer but afraid to encounter the same problem. I will continue doing my research."
1,Bad seller,Printer did not work. Powered up but would not print. I have seven of these printers no problems
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,PRINTER STOPPED RECEIVING PHOTO PAPER AFTER COUPLE OF MONTHS AND NO WAY TO FIX. DON'T EVEN TRY.PRODUCT SUCKS! AFTER THIS I WILL NEVER BUY HP AGAIN.
1,Be Warned : Junk,"Well I never written a review, but i have to write about this one. Buy something else. Even if it is still HP just don't buy this one. It worked great for a few months then it got jammed. Its easy to fix just open the back at there is the paper. I tried to print again and now the paper does not feed. When it does it takes 3 or 4 pages or the whole stack. Then it jams again. JUNK!!!!!!"
1,HP failed on this one,"Paper tray feeding is lousy from both the regular paper tray and the 4x6 photo tray. I've given up on this HP model, despite the company's reputation for quality printers. The printer continually failed to recognize that the trays were well stocked with paper, and instead indicated that the trays were empty. Nothing I could find in the manual would take care of this. As a result, getting one page printed was often a hassle of three or four of these messages until somehow the printer finally grabbed paper to print on."
1,Lousy durability,"After several months of non use ( alternate printer ) in resurrecting 8250 it complained that cartridges were too old ( they were ). Replaced $50 worth of ink to then have ""smart printer tell me that it needed service.Good luck with that. HP has outsourced service and with so so durability I figure I am much better off scrapping printer and going to Cannon or some other more highly rated company. I only resent paying $50 for new ink to find out printer is inoperable."
1,Can't recommend it for occasional home use,"If new and used on a regular basis, this is a fine printer.However, when not being used for a couple of months, this printer will die.What happens is that the ink dries in the six rubber tubes that connect the cartridges to the print head. Once the flow is stopped, you can throw away the printer. There is no way to clean the tubes internally.Therefore, unfortunately, as good a job as it does while alive, it is absolutely not recommendable. HP should recall them all and replace them for free even after warranty expired. It is a substandard design to me and should not have hit the market in the first place. No question that I am upset about it, especially as I am sitting on nearly $200 worth of ink inventory that becomes worthless too."
1,Not in working order!,"I love my old HP Photosmart 8250 but it stopped working. I was happy to havean opportunity to order another for a reasonable price, but when I set it up (it didnot come with a power cord, so I used my own) it had a very similar problem to theother one. I have not yet asked Amazon how I should deal with this since it wasordered from a third party."
2,Dismal service,Had to return replacement unit as it was clear it was dropped in shipping and would not feed paper. After many hours running tests and sitting on the phone they agreed to send a 2nd replacement. One area of disappointment was that the number to call for a UPS pickup was for a phone service call-girl. I tried to explain this to HP to no avail. All in all I found the experience disappointing.
1,I give up,"If you have some creepy obsession with buying printer ink, this is the printer for you. If you don't use it, the expires. If you buy new ink, it doesn't recognize it and tells you to go back to the store and pay for another try. It has never printed a decent picture and the program is not the easiest to work with (will cut off edges of photos, etc.). It jams, doesn't accept certain sizes of paper (especially envelopes), and has proven useless on many an occasion. I have had this printer for years and I attest that it is no good."
1,Printer,"It does not work, what more can I say. The paper pickup is defective. This is a common problem with this printer but would have been nice to know it was occuring.."
1,waiting to return,I received this printer a week ago and it did not work right out of the box- still waiting for response for processing the return!
4,i do need some advice,"i do absolutely love this printer, however i am having some issues with it now. i put all new ink in and i can't get it to print correctly. when i print out the test page all the color squares are finr, but the black one is vertically lined. does anyone have any advice?? it's a great product, but the customer service sucks!thanks, michelle"
2,"Great photos, but a pain for overall as a printer","The photos are nice, but I am not able to print black only text if one color cartridge is out. We blow through the color cartridges very quickly and to replace them isn't horrible if it's one at a time, but to do a few at a time is pricey. This would be great as a dedicated photo printer, but has too many limitations for me. The LCD is really a dumb idea, as well as the built in card reader. I never use either. The thing that annoys me the most is it does ""maintenance"" all the time and holds up printing."
1,Near impossible to load paper and print the photos!,"After owning this printer for 3+ years, I have to cite my absolute and total frustration with the printer. It is almost impossible to get the paper feed to work.Is it just me, or did HP forget to design the paperfeed until the last minute?I should have returned this product IMMEDIATELY and now I pay for that decision everytime I need to print something.Whenever I want to print a photo, I have to give myself 1+ hours to get the paper feed to work. Seriously.DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE PRINTER!!!"
3,"""Ink System Failure"" says it all","It worked well for my light-duty use for the 16 months: good quality prints, even ink coverage, fast. But last June I got my first ""ink system failure"" error message. I was able to clear it with about 4 hours of effort (using a patch downloadable from the HP website). Now, 5 months later, the error is back, and 8 hours of effort has not been enough to fix the problem. The HP customer care rep's advice was to 'buy a new printer.' I have no choice but to take that advice. It just won't be an HP printer."
2,"Worked great for 12 months, RIP","Then it started jamming and now it can't be repaired. With the relative light usage it received, I would have expected a longer life span. I gave it two stars as it was great while it lasted."
1,HP Bombed with this one,"I have been a loyal fan of HP printers. I have in fact had several all of which have performed beautifully. At least until I purchased the 8250. I purchased it about 3 mos ago and have had nothing but problems. It frequently suffers paper jams (in both the regular tray and the photo paper tray) and is very slow. It is also eradict in its speed, printing one page very fast and the very next page very slowly. Also the help files are very poor. I tried to follow the directions to put the printer on automatic shut off and the directions can't be followed on the software. Overall this printer is very bad. I would not purchase it again."
2,Nice Look; heavy expense,"I bought this Printer 40 days ago. This is a great printer if you have:1) bluethooth technology on your computer and related $40 adaptors (which my computer did not),2) a compatible memory card or ""PictBridge"" camera (which my Olympus camera was not),3) a desire to spend lots more money and support the HP ink cartridge industry due to the small size of the (unrefillable)cartridges. I printed 120 4x6 photos (in ""draft"" mode) and had to replace 3 of the cartridges, at $10 a piece.My HP 940c printer produces photos of same apparent quality. There are many other printers with greater compatibility and ink economy, at a smaller price (Epson comes to mind).Bottom line: I'm selling my HP 8250 Printer and getting a cheaper one with more functionality (generic wireless; camera USB connectivity)and is less expensive to operate."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"After just a few uses the paper feed stopped picking up paper and the printer gave an ""out of paper"" error message. It seems that A LOT of people are having the same problem, so you'd think considering the money we spend on the printer and cartridges, HP would offer a (free) solution. Well, after losing over an hour on hold with their customer service I emailed the HP service center, only to be told where I can buy a cleaning kit for $30.47 Buy a Canon, Samsung, whatever, just stay away from HP!"
2,TERRIBLE RELIABILITY,"The 8250 does print very nice pictures. However, the ink takes a while to dry. All it's positives cannot overcome it's reliability. The auto paper sensor failed right after the warranty. After disabling the auto sensor, and manually selecting the paper it gave a message that said the wrong size paper is being used . A call to HP was a terrible experience. I got someone in India that i could not understand for the life of me. She took about 15 minutes to take down the serial #,Phone # etc. She lost the info a few times and had to retype. After all this she then said ""i have to charge you $30.00 before i can talk to you"". At this point i just hung up. The printer is in the trash. I am going back to Epson. This was my first HP and my last."
1,Rnn away...run away,Don't be fooled by the performance out of the box! Soon you will see that the paper feed mechanism breaks and then you'll start using language you never knew you had in you.Seriously - this printer breaks and will lead to frustration. Avoid it at all costs.
1,read the 1-star reviews: it really won't feed paper,"The other 1-star reviews are right: this printer has serious problems feeding paper. Right out of the box, it had trouble feeding paper and often displayed an ""out of paper"" error message when paper was in the tray. I was able to get the printer to work most of the time by reloading paper and/or pressing OK multiple times, but eventually the printer just refuses to feed paper from the letter-size tray at all.I should note, the paper is HP-brand, specifically for use with this printer.It's too bad, because otherwise the printer is great: fantastic print quality, outstanding speed, very easy setup for both Windows and Mac OS X. But all of this matters little when it won't feed the paper..."
2,Paper Jammer!,"Like many others, I loved the printed quality but found the printer jammed frequently. Per HP's instructions, I cleaned the roller, worked for few pages then stopped. HP will sell a $19.95 cleaner kit, but why bother. You can't even single sheet feed it."
1,Do Not Buy This Rubbish Product,"As many of the other reviews for this product have said, mine worked fine for a couple of months and then stopped feeding paper and was completely useless. I could do nothing to remedy this. On the plus side, it makes a lovely, if rather pricey, doorstop."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER,"Can you rate something less than ""1""? I bought this printer directly from HP and paid about $250. I have had it for several years. It is absolutely the worse printer I have ever owned. The paper feeder is CONSTANTLY jammed. In reading other reviews on HP printers, I find that many people have had similar problems. Check out Canon products. They tend to be much more reliable."
5,Good Introduction to the Special Challenges of High Tech,"When marketers transfer into high-tech businesses for the first time, they often ask me what book I recommend to help them understand the special issues they face. Such executives would be well advised to acquire, read and understand the many valuable lessons in this book. There is no major theme related to high-tech marketing that is not explored in this book. For those who would like to know more, each chapter references the top sources for these issues.The book is well organized, each segment is easy to read and understand, and all of the chapters have helpful summaries at the end to help you absorb what you have just studied.The book will not, however, be of as much value to those who have worked in the industry for at least five years. These executives will have absorbed most of the book's lessons on their own. For that reason, I suggest that this book will be of most value to those who are new to high-tech marketing."
2,Maniacs in Japan-Live [IMPORT] [LIVE],"please , give the price of the CD how can i pay for it when it'll camethanks Hércules."
5,Love it,Hanging in store doesnt do this set justice.Looks so beautiful.soft material plenty for the money.
2,Power Rangers Lord Zedd Waves,"Dumb episode about a triathalon thats going on at Angel Grove where Jason ,Zack ,Trini ,and Rocky ,Adam ,and Aisha are participating.The other three Tommy ,Billy ,and Kimberly are watching from the sidelines. Meanwhile Lord Zedd creates a monster that forces everyone to obey Lord Zedd. Soon the rangers and everyone else are under the spell ezcept for Rocky Adam and Aisha friends of the rangers. Will the rangers defeat this monster or will Zedd finally have claimed dominance? Buy the movie to find out."
1,Huh?,I dont thnk the price matches the productand it was not soft as silkit was not what I expected.. it was to transparent and not what it looks like on the webi did not like itI tought it was going to be more like poleyster or Lycra
4,this is for you,These bikinis scream this is for you...when wet they leave nothing to the imagination....I dare you to ware them on a public beach
5,A delightful world,"Another great set of books by Enid Blyton. Again, as a librarian, I cannot recommend these books enough to the 4th-6th grade girls. There is something magical about these book that will have your girls wanting to go off to bording school for midnight feasts and trips into town."
3,"Useful, but dated and has errors","Illustrations in the book could be improved if in addition to the dimensional drawing, a 1:1 drawing were available as well, to present the proper scale to all the cartridges.Overall, the book is useful as a compendium of the myriad of metallic cartridges that were available at one point in time or another. However, the book is dated and is in serious need of updating in order to keep current. Moreover, there are some glaring errors in the book, which makes it mandatory that the reader have other sources of information as well.One item was the 454 Casull Magnum, which has dimensions identical to the 45Colt, while this might have been true back in 1987, it is not true today.An update to the book would certainly be most welcome and needed."
2,Buy something else,Although there is a few very nice tracks on this record you really should spend your money on something else. Peace
3,"Disappointing, but okay.","The trouble with this album is the sheer weight of the ballad content...especially in the second half of the CD. What's worse is that the four lesser ballads (""I Am"", ""Donna Please"", ""Missing You"" and ""Anyway"") all sound pretty much the same as each other.That's not to say that the CD is all bad, indeed the other seven songs range from good to great, and the few uptempo tracks are very well done indeed. The title track is my favourite from the album, and features some tasty bass playing from TOTO's Mike Porcaro who guests on several tracks. Curiously Steve also thanks Jeff Porcaro in the albums liner notes despite him having been dead for two years by the time the CD was released.Vocally this album, like all of Perry's work is to die for, it's just a shame that too much of the material has a sameness to it. Not an album to play if you're tired - you won't make it to the end."
5,the band perry is steve's kids,"IF YOU LOVE STEVE PERRY, YOU WILL LOVE HIS KIDS AS THEY SING AMAZING ""The BAND PERRY"", They have an amazing father to teach them!!!"
2,Street Talk a much better album,"I think Steve Perry has one of the best voices in the business. But this album??? Stinks. There are two good songs and 3 more decent ones. The rest STINK! Very borning. Borrow it, before you buy it!"
2,Depressing,"The themes of nearly every song on this record are depressing. If you like feeling like cr*p, then buy this. Otherwise, get Street Talk. Street Talk has upbeat pop, that makes you feel good. Most of this record sounds like it was written by someone that was suicidal. Steve Perry is a great singer, but not even he can make this record listenable."
1,This is Terrible!,"I'm a big Journey fan and liked Steve's first solo record, ""Street Talk"" but this is one atrociously written, produced and sung disc! Ugggh! Absolutely unlistenable."
5,For The Love of Strange Medicine,"Being on ""old"" Journey fan, and not being able to enjoy the greatest of all time male singer's voice with that band, what a joy this CD is. Steve Perry has the cleanest, purest voice ever! What a great CD. Loved every song on the CD. Would highly recommend this CD to any true Steve Perry fan."
5,A Celebration of Life,"Rachel Cross is a uniquely talented songwriter and singer. One of her many strengths is writing songs of social commentary that don't make the listener feel sad, but rather empowered (see ""Freedom Song"" and ""She Went Walking""). Her songs exhibit a joyful spirit without a trace of naivete.This recording is a festival of sounds and, with all of its various moods and languages, feels like a celebration of life, all of it.Rachel is an engaging performer, and having had the pleasure of seeing her perform live, I was excited to find that her live energy comes through on this CD. It needs to be in your CD player."
4,"Big Vision, Otherworldly","Rachel's music is what the world needs to hear - loud and clear.Rachel's writing comes from a heart that obviously loves her planet and ALL the people on it - and she wants to see them at peace.She injects her music with varied musical influences - the sky is the limit and the end product is tasty.If you would like to go on a musical journey that makes you think, laugh and tap your toe ( all at the same time) -- Rachel's absolutely original and highly developed talent and vision will entrance."
5,marvelous pieces by young Americans,"Zall did an incredible job pulling together various pieces by young Americans before and during our revolution. He introduces each with a succinct introduction. Though a few writers are famous or have famous parents such as J. Q. Adams and Martha Jefferson, the rest are known to us until we read their personal accounts. At least one, by Slave Andrew at the trial of soldiers who fired on rioters in the ""Boston Massacre,"" forces us to examine a cherished American myth. His words are so literate and true we cannot help but question whether is wasn't the ""patriots"" who were at fault and provoke the ""lobsterbacks"" into firing. Other firsthand accounts describe the hardships of the war, especially for Quaker pacifists and British loyalists. All are glimpses into a long and ugly war we can imagine a little better with these gems."
2,"Worked fine for a while, but then went crazy.","I originally purchased the Hunter humidifier based upon internet reviews. It certainly worked in the beginning to humidify the room quickly. The problem is that the unit is pretty noisy when new, and became awful as time progressed. It's worth noting that I can sleep through almost anything, living in noisy New York City as I do. As such, I returned the unit and got a Hamilton Beach instead. I think that it is the better, and quieter, humidifier."
2,Great product -Poor Design,"We purchased this humidifier and within 7 days, it was returned. The fans blades kept hitting on something inside the fan housing and on closer inspection, they have placed part of the electrical connection inside the housing and secured it with a plastic tighener - bad idea. The clicking sound drove me nuts. It sounded like the cards you would place on the rear tire of your bike when you were a kid. I have contacted Hunter about this problem and hope that they rectify it. The product works great and except for the noise, performed very well."
2,somewhat maintenance free,"I've obviously had a run of bad luck with these humidifiers, I've gone through 3 in a matter of months. The motor on each quit. The company acknowleged that they were having a problem with them, and to their credit, mailed me a new one right away free of charge. I live in an area with very hard water, and have to clean it much more often than once a month. The manual is not clear on how to clean all the parts, and I also had a problem with mold getting into areas that are not accessible to clean. The company told me to put vinegar into the water in the base, and run it through the machine while on, that didn't help either. I've tried to make it work for a few seasons now, but this year I'm going to try a different brand."
1,A sucker born every minute.,"I bought 4 of these digital units with the nite light. No. 1: Refill light stays on constantly, unit will run even with empty tank. Nite light burned out after a week. Water forms on top of unit. No 2: Refill light stays on constantly, fan is inoperative after a week, Placed unit in dumpster. No. 3: Unit was shipped from factory without water pump assembly. Took assembly from unit No. 2 and installed on No. 3. No go, put unit in dumpster. No. 4: Unit was shipped from factory without water pump assembly, put in dumpster. In the midst of these problems, I bought an Air-O Swiss 7135. O what a relief to find something that actually works. SOO quiet, no algae, beautiful engineering. Hunter unit No. 1 just started making squealing noises from the fan. Time for another visit to the dumpster!!!"
1,"This is not a book, it's a sketchbook!","This entree is one example of the risks of buying books through the internet. It has a title, it has an ISBN, a front cover showing the Empire State and it has an author listed so as far as you know it, it could be a gem for those searching the globe for skyscraper books. But this is not a book. It's an 240 page sketchbook with empty pages, i.e. you make the sketches. This item should not be listed a book."
2,Only worth buying from a used bookstore,"The book has some useful information, but it is heavily concentrated on schools in the Northeast. For example, the best private high school here in San Francisco Bay Area is not included. It doesn't have some vital statistics that a parent would look for,like the % of graduates that go to colleges, and which colleges the graduating seniors are accepted or attend each year. The information on most schools seem to come straight from the brochures from those schools. Little detail or school specific information is included.Basically not worth buying. Can spend a couple of hours checking it out in a library or in a Border's Bookstore."
4,For older children,"Follow the age recommendation! I bought this for a 6-year-old and it was way too advanced. It is a great book, though, and I'll save it for him when he's nine or ten.Would buy again."
3,Helpful for mild anxiety and fear,"This book may be helpful for mild fear or anxiety. But not if a person is severely impaired or ""mentally ill"". If you know someone who is ""comitted"" or insane, chances are more likely they have what the Bible calls a ""spirit of fear"". Scripture says that.... God does not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind. It also says that fear hath torment (mental and physical torment). If you have a spirit of fear, then you know what I mean (OCD, hopelessness, the physical charges or sensations). Scripture also states that perfect love casteth out fear. If you are in a verbally or physically abusive relationship, you will not be free. Drugs may be necessary to keep you going till you are free. Also, pray to God to set you free from the bondage you are in."
4,Awesome story of war and men.,Wow. Awesome story about war. Makes war more real than anything you see on tv or read in the news. A very personal story. Great psychological drama about the photographer and his conflicts.
3,Lemon Sisters,I have not received the Lemon Sisters tape and two of the tapes that i did recieve did not work so I will not be ordering any more. The two tapes that I said that I hated was becuse they did not work.
3,Cute cookie,"Clever idea but difficult to remove cookies and no switch to turn the voice off without waiting for it to go into sleep mode. Plastic is hard, the kind that cracks easily."
1,Very Disappointing. Broken after less than 1 Week,"My 15 month old son received this as a gift less than one week ago. He's managed to figure out how to put the cookies in correctly. The cookies only go in one way and it's difficult to put them in sometimes, even for an adult. In the week that we've had it, the ""2"" cookie no longer works, so he can't play the ""Find the Number"" game. Also I've noticed that if you don't have all the numbers in front of you, you can't play the game successfully either because it frequently asks for numbers that are already in the jar.It seems that the jar is of dubious use as a learning tool as well. If the cookies are too difficult to put in the jar, it won't count them. It also frequently misreads the cookies and then tells you that your correct answer is incorrect. Very frustrating for a young child! Save your money and buy a different toy that lasts longer and may have more educational value."
4,Cute but cookies are odd looking,"The cookie jar is adorable but the cookies themselves are cheap and the ""M&M's"" are very poorly painted and hard to see."
3,No number 6,"My girl loves this toy but I am a bit disappointed. I received the Cookie Jar with 10 cookies but there's no number 6 and have two number 8s :( Sad because she gets a bit confused when it comes to find number 6 and there's non!I guess I can't sent it back, since I am outside the US and it will take ages to get a refund or to get another one.:("
2,Annoying product,My two boys received this product as a gift. For very young children is confusing and difficult to push the cookies in the toy and for older children too simple. It also has an attract mode where it will randomly start talking and has scared me several time at 3 am. There is no off switch. An off switch should be required for any talking/electric children's toy.
1,"cute, but Cookie Jar doesn't know his numbers!","My son received this as a birthday gift. It is very cute, but not as educational as intended. In the mode where it asks you for a specific number cookie, the Cookie Jar often does not recognize the cookie correctly. For example, I put in the number 8 cookie, and the jar says ""Oops, that's the number 7."" I thought perhaps new batteries would help, but it does the same thing. 25 - 50% of the time, the toy does not recognize the cookie number correctly. Very annoying and confusing for learning toddlers. I do not recommend this to at all."
5,MY SON LOVES THIS TOY,I read a few of the review for this toy and yes this is a simple toy but my 1 year old son loves this toy. It is his favorite toy. I will ask him to go and get his cookie jar and he will run and bring it to me. He loves to get the cookies out push them back in over and over and over. I even bring this toy on trips because it is the only toy i know he will play with no matter what. We have lost a few of the cookies but this toy was the best gift he has received. I would have to say the voice of the cookie jar is a little loud but other than that a 5 star from us!
2,Needs Mode Button,"Only does two things:Counts cookies child puts inAnd Asks for a certain number and child has to find itNo button to switch from one mode to the other.My baby has the put cookies in part down. but she is too young to recognize different numbers yet.so the cookie jar is SUPER ANNOYING.because it keeps sayingCan you find the number ONEUH-OHCan you find the number ONEUH-OHUH-OHIf there was a small button on the bottom perhaps it would be better so I could put it on ""count the cookie mode"" instead of ""Find the cookie mode"""
1,Why Capitol Why?,"Why did Capitol Records decide to release a new volume of Christmas Cocktails with the other two previous volumes as a box set?I'm sure this new collection, for the most part, will only appeal to the collectors of the other 26 volumes in this series, who already have Part 1 and 2.Why should I have to buy Part 1 and 2 again so I can get Part 3? Damnit!And I also notice the new volume only has 15 tracks, a lot less than the previous volumes.With marketing decisions like this, it's no wonder the record companies are in a slump. Shame on you, Capitol, for this blunder!!!"
1,Disc 3 only available here? How disappointing?,"As an owner of disc one and two purchased from Amazon, I was really disappointed to find, as others have, that disc three is only available in this set. Is this a joke? We all need to write to Capital Records and complain. Why would part one and two be available and not part three? Maybe Amazon should allow those of us who bought parts 1 and 2 from them to exchange them for the 3 disc set. It would be good business practice IMHO. Hopefully Capital will hear our plea and offer disc 3 on its own.Coming back to this review in 2006, one year after I wrote the 1st part of this review, Disc 3 is now available on its own, so I will now say that this set deserves 4 stars."
2,"Wow, this is lame!","I had high hopes for this as I picked up the Rat Pack Xmas CD last year and it was pretty cool. While this set has a couple gems in it, there is a whole bunch of instrumental organ music that reminds me of being at a public ice skating rink in the 1960s. That really ruined it for me.Suitable only for nursing homes and breaking hostage sieges."
2,Check with Standard Deviants,"Search for SDS Pre-Algebra Module, though the super pack is not available, but all these 7 DVDs are available individually and compare which one is cheaper before you buy, as the products are one and the same, but in the market with 2 different names,"
4,Interesting insights on the people in her life,"Slim Keith has done a wonderful job of providing an up close and personal look at the famous people in her life. Her insights, particularly into her stepfamilies, are what make her a skilled commentator on the era she inhabited and its effects on others. She honestly depicts herself and others as flawed but worthwhile people who were sometimes at cross-purposes but struggled to understand each other anyhow."
5,I wish I could have met Slim!,"I am throughly disgusted with the previous review. Apparently we did not read the same book. The Slim I read about was fasinating and self-depracating. She was a great broad - a terrific friend with wonderful self-knowledge and zest for life. She never wanted to be the next margaret mead or sandra o'connor. And why should she have to be? Her life was so interesting and the way she tells it - you wanted to be there - be one of her friends. Also, I did not realize Hemingway was washed up when he wrote ""The Old Man and the Sea"" and Capote finished when he penned ""In Cold Blood"" - both manuscripts handed over to their dear friend - Slim - to look over! What was the reviewer expecting?? If you can obtain this book - do it - and you will be throughly entertained. It's a book you can go back to time and time again."
3,A rich and shallow life,"I too was interested in reading about the woman that has been called an fashion icon . The book was interesting mostly because of the characters in it but not Slim herself. She is completely autocratic. Her main obsession is herself. She leaves her newborn daughter and goes off to NYC and Cuba to pamper herself and be adored. She seems to treat her stepchildren with more warmth than her own child, Kitty, who it seems, is always away at school. Slim is the worst of snobs parading around as a liberal. She thinks she's being down to earth when she actually has a picnic where the butler and his wife eat with her but she's quick to point out that she used fine china whilst they used the kitchen plates. She was a great beauty and possessed elegant fashion sense but that is about all. The people in her world were far more interesting as she herself admits."
1,lame memories,"I was interested in reading the biography of a woman whom I knew little about...but whose name is referenced regularly, even today.Given the crowd she ran in and the men she allegedly fascinated, I assumed she would have something interesting to say...about her life and times at the very least. Sadly, the book isa shallow account of Nancy's life. But perhaps she really was so shallow that what little I learned about this woman is all there is."
5,Slim Keith is a class act!,I found this book wandering through my local library and what a find! Iwas thrilled to be able to order it through AMAZON. Slim Keith is an American original and one of my all-time favorites. Along with Claire Booth Luce and Lady Diana (Mrs. Duff) Cooper she was a beautiful blonde that was graced with extraordinary intelligence and a scathing wit. They just don't make them like they used to.
5,my baby loves this drum!,"My 10 month old loves playing with this drum! The different play settings on it are great and she loves the blinking light ""head"" on the drum. Great first musical instrument!"
4,Pretty good...entertaining.,"No complaints so far. Works like it should. My nephew seems to like it although his attention span is about 10 seconds long. The only improvement I would suggest is that the drum should be triggered by a slap on the outer edges of the drum.. not just by a slap on the middle of the drum. Otherwise, a worthwhile purchase."
4,bright and fun with one tiny downfall,"The colors are brilliant and bright... our 15 month old is in love with it. To my surprise, it doesn't seem to be much of a battery guzzler like most toys. Only downside is it's VERY sensitive. Closing a door 15 feet a way can set it off (ever the lowest volume is still kinda loud) and it's scary/annoying/frusterating and will wake my little guy from a nap if I forget to turn it off. Worth buying, for sure though"
3,Decent but doesn't live up to hype,"I really wanted to love this drum based on all the other reviews. However, I was slightly disappointed (see CONS below)PROS:(1) It's durable and would stand up to play(2) It has 3 different functions - music, drum sound, and music(3) Rolls on it's sideCONS:(1) The first thing I saw when I opened up the box to take out the drum was a disclaimer stating that the toy interferes with radio waves. It seems odd a toy would do such a thing. I leads me to wonder what ""waves"" or what it's emitting that would do such a thing. Not really thrilled that my daughter would be playing with such a toy.(2) I wish you could play on both ends of the drum. The bottom has the battery hatch and on/volume switch(3) Wish is sounded more like a real drum...it's very electronic"
3,It's alright!,"I spent forever looking at different drums because my baby was learning to pat things with his hands so I figured he would love something that would respond to his beats. Most where a good chunk of change but since this drum had such great reviews I though it would be worth it.The seller I bought it from sold it used and when I got it, it reeked of cigarette smoke and didn't work (she did replace it with a different kind free of charge) so I bought a new one at walmart.com.My baby didn't really play with and he still hasn't, he'll use it for a second then gets bored even as he got older he didn't really take to it.Honestly, babies like realistic things more then toys so I recommend buying a small real drum."
5,He loves it,"This toy is very simple yet very entertaining. My 1 year easily figured out that the buttons on the side of the drum put it in different modes; the modes make the toy more interesting. Unlike other electronic toys we own, this one does not continuously make noise when your child stops playing with it... very nice!"
4,terrific baby toy!,"I bought this toy for my granddaughter for her first birthday, at the suggestion of my son and daughter-in-law. They told me she had played with a similar toy at daycare, which she loved. She squealed in delight when she saw the drum light up and make music. This was one of her favorite toys to play with, and she figured out right away how to make the drum play music and lights. This was only 2 months ago, so I can't say much yet about its durability."
4,Get them dancing,"My son received this as a gift for his first birthday. He loves anything musical and this drum is no exception. And I like that he is learning cause and effect. Also, the music is fantastic and gets him dancing everytime it plays (and unlike many of his toys, it's not annoying or overly noisey even on the highest volume setting). We liked it so much that we bought two more as first birthday gifts for his friends."
4,Amazing Drum for 6 months old,This drum is amazing. I bought it for my 6 months old because he likes to tap with flat hands on just about anything I put in front of him. Since the drum has a sort of flat surface that responds to taps so it was an ideal choice for my baby. He keeps hitting the drum surface and drum always obliges with a sound. That helps my baby understand cause and effect. Sometimes instead of just a beat drum will play various tones for I think 30 odd seconds. Only my baby can make the drum to do that. Me and my wife still don't know where to hit to get that sound :D. This drum also helps him to sit as he places his hands on it to support himself.There are buttons on the body of the drum that also make sounds. If you roll the drum it makes sound as well.The only minor minor inconvenience is size of the drum. Its difficult to hold this drum in one hand. So handling the baby and at the same time handling this toy sometimes becomes a little challenging.
4,Great toy that holds interest,"I saw this toy at my son's daycare. All the kids were sitting around it and ""hitting"" the drum. I thought if every kid there is intrigued, it must be good. The age recco is 9 months and up, but my son has loved it since 6.5 months. Since it's arrived, it's become his ""go to"" toy. He doesn't seem to tire of it. He loves seeing it light up and make sounds when he hits it. Or rolls it. It's a very good toy for showing cause and effect. My husband and I like it because the music and sounds are fun, and not irritating. It's a wonderful toy that I will be giving as a gift in the future."
4,"Fun, and has volume control","This is a neat drum. My seven month old enjoys it. Has three different buttons on the side. Can make fun beating sounds every time it is hit, or can hit it to activate songs to be played automatically, and has a button that when the drum is beat, makes swirly, silly sounds. Also, when the drum is placed on the side, it rolls, and makes sound then. My daughter will enjoy this drum well into her two's. It has two volumes. Low and high. My five year old plays with it as well : )"
2,Wasn't that fun or educational,"Looks nice in concept, but my 10 months old baby didn't like it that much and it didn't help her learning to crawl!"
5,A Favorite,"I've never posted a review on Amazon but I have to speak up in favor of the Flash Beat Drum. It is seriously underappreciated with only three reviews thus far! My one-year old boy does his happy dance and applauds wildly whenever he hears the Caribbean-style tunes. We have a room full of toys, and he reaches for this one first."
3,OK But Lost Interest,"I was excited about this toy when I read the reviews. We've been playing music , signing and dancing with our baby since he was a few months old. Now at 10+ months he claps his hands when we sign ""if you're happy and you know it..."" well you get it. He also will hold a tambourine and strike it with his free hand . All context for the fact that we are encouraging his artistic exploration. We got the drum and was happy with the size. Just right for him and not too big. He was excited as it was NEW. Over time though he would simply flip the thing upside down a few times and leave it. No matter how much we tapped on it, rolled and tried to encourage use. Can't make a baby do what you want all the time. The thing I wasn't crazy about is when your in drum mode and tap it, the sound and light seems delayed and somewhat muted. My mom brought over a empty tin of sugar cookies and he bangs on that more than this. Go figure. Not the toys fault but he's just not that into it."
2,Too difficult for a baby,"I don't know if I had a defective product, but you have to hit the top of the drum quite hard and with a large surface area (i.e. your whole palm) to get a sound. Even as an adult I couldn't make the drum respond every time. It would be nearly impossible for my 6 month old baby to play with it in a satisfactory manner. Returned."
2,- not medieval music,"The vocal of this CD is satisfactory, however much of the rest of it is electronic music with a very new age sound. If you are looking for authentic medieval music, this is not the CD for you."
3,Hard to clean,I could not remove the bottome plate to clean the feeder. Overall a good feeder and pretty. The birds love it.
3,Very nice product but does not ward off the squirrels,This feeder was what I was looking for as far as appearance but when the squirrels couldn't get in it the normal way of chewing through the plastic the just knocked the top off. The copper is great at preventing them from chewing but instead of the top screwing on like other feeders it slides up and down a fragile wire. The squirrels were able to separate the top from the bottom causing the entire feeder to fall. I am now trying to figure out how to fix this problem so I can still use it. I just don't understand why they fixed one issue with the standard plastic bird feeder and replaced the another feature that was more secure.
2,"Great Idea, not quality product","I had seen another mom use this at a party, but a plastic version. This item looked beautiful so I bought it. The handle broke the first time I used it. Very disappointing. I am searching for the plastic version now."
2,Sheet Cake Slicer,It works but it gets out of shape and handles come off easily. You must keep wiping off the icing. I also have the triangle cutter for round pie shape cakes. Never have had any problem with that one.
5,Sonnets great and less so,"THE SONNET IN OLD AGEIf to the sessions of sweet silent thoughtone summons memories of sonnets long reread in mindunsprings the blasted lyrics Time has left unpageddreams of other nights and other daysin quiet places long since lost in youthwhere little lines embodied- Glory, Beauty, Truth.Then Shakespeare Donne Keats,Hopkins Milton Wordsworth Yeatsobscuring lesser names and smaller shadesinspire with dearer dearer lifetranquillity's reflectionin old ageConsoling our last momentsin God's praise."
3,GHERAND SAMHTA EKA UTTAM YOGA KA GRANTHA HAI.,"I read this book many times when i was practising the hath yoga.A maha yogi(RAMARISHI) from india,jodhpur,advised me to go through this book,WHEN I APPROACHED HIM FOR GUIDENCE.The book ""gheranda samhita"",is complete book covering all informations about asanas,pranayama,mudras,and meditations etc..,.the auther did a lot of effort to translate and define the book.I whole heartedly congatulate him,and appriciate his efforts.I also suggest all the persons interested in yoga(specially hathayoga)to read this book,i am sure they will find it very usefull and helpfull for their yoga. spsharma,<ridhi88@yahoo.com>"
3,Just good,"I expected to find more current treatment to the psychiatry patology,but this book deals with other interesting issues as psychoanalysis"
3,smells,"it smells. bad. it's probably the packaging or the new plastic and rubber. either way, the smell got so bad it was nauseating and spread through the entire room, and it wouldn't go away for at least two weeks, even after scrubbing it twice and constantly using room refresher.other than that, the size is perfect for architectural model class' projects, and its self healing remains the best.I'd still recommend this product, but bear with the smell for a while."
3,good not great,"Good size and helps ruler stay put, but isn't really self healing, which, to me, is kind of a problem. And I just saw a comparably sized mat at walmart for under $30. Not thrilled about that."
3,gives you the basics,"This video will give you the basics of what you need to know to make something plastic (wax, metal, rubber are mentioned but not covered.) It also gives you sources for materials, but only making things will teach you how to make what you want to make. It's a satisfactory introduction into mold making and though it's painfully clear Ben Ridge relied on a script, I'm satisfied with what I've gotten out of it and glad I bought it at amazon rather than another source for more money."
1,Don't waste your time or $,"If you are at all into casting or even done some reading this is resource is not for you. I paid for a video and a workbook. The video was very basic and the workbook was a joke. There are better resources online and on You tube.If you know absolutely nothing about casting then this might be a good place to start. Otherwise, do your homework and check out the resources on casting suppliers web sites. They have wonderful casting products, instruction and resources."
4,Interesting but outdated.,"This book is a good read, with fine information on some of the more popular nines, including the Beretta and the SIG. Ammunition is also discussed. There are also lots of pictures (b&w). The potential reader should, however, keep in mind that this book was published before our rulers passed another of their baleful edicts (1994 ""Crime Bill"") from Washington. This was also before the ""resurgence"" of the .45 Automatic pistol and was more or less at the start of the .40 S&W's dominance as a police pistol caliber. I was also a little shocked at the author's equivocation of the .38 Special with the .357 Magnum! But for fans of the 9mm round, the book is worth checking out. Look for it at gun shows (I picked mine up for $5) or just buy it here if you can't find one."
4,Basic tool for basic jobs,"It's nothing fancy, but it does the job. After using the rake for a few weeks, it seems to work great for the small lawn jobs I have. My only complaint is that the handle gave me a sliver, but overall I have been pleased with it."
4,Doesn't harden very quickly,"This product seems to be durable, but doesn't harden very quickly (to the point that you could sand it). The hardening process takes a few days, maybe because it was cool here at the time of the repair (around 55-60 F)..."
2,Thankfully This Wasn't The Last Horror Film,"I bought The Last Horror Film without having even seen it first, because of the good reviews. I'm a huge slasher movie fan, so usually if others like a slasher movie I will too. Sadly, I didn't like The Last Horror Film. It has three things going for it: Caroline Munro, the awesome music, and a surprise ending. Everyone else from the script to the low body count is a bore. If you want to see a fun slasher movie starring Caroline Munro, rent Slaughter High instead."
5,An excellent toy with many fun features!,"This is a super fun toy that my daughter has had now for over a year. If you can find it ANYWHERE I would highly recommend it. It plays pre-programmed songs plus your child can also be her own musician and even record her music for playback. The microphone is nice for aspiring American Idols (like my daughter!) and it really is pretty. We did lose the dancing Cinderella with Prince Charming, but while we had it is was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played. It also does a pretty light show. I cannot give this toy enough stars as it is a really wonderful toy for 3-6 year old girls!"
4,It's SO great,"How could anyone hate this so much when it sounds so beautiful. It's not a one song album like ""songs of"" and phil spector's production beats anything he did with his girl groups (execept riverdeep...) .It just sounds so warm!"
5,Dont believe the critics! It is daunting and gorgeous.,"Admitedly Mr. Cohen himselh is not fond of this album, however it is an amazing record, well worth having, and listening to many times. I would possibly skip one title but then again it is part of the legacy... Nice going Mr. Cohen, and certainly nothing to be ashamed of..."
5,Call me crazy....,"I love this album. It's one I listen to again & again. Yes, it's a different sound for Leonard but all the songs are decent (sans Fingerprints--actually, its just the corny chorus that I don't like). Don't buy it if this is your first foray into Cohen. Go with something safe like ""The Future"" instead, then progress backwards into ""New Skin for Old""."
1,This is the one to avoid,"I consider myself a Leonard Cohen fan. Still, I heard this album only twice in my life. The first time, as soon as I bought it, full of excitement... The second time, about four years later, only to realize it sounds just as bad as the first time...To me, it was a total dissapointment. Leonard Cohen's voice is squashed under Phil Spector ""wall of sound"" and both sound dull, uninspired and incompatible. The subtle eroticism of Leonard Cohen's lyrics gives way to gratuitous raunchiness.And the few fine moments (which there are, I must admit) are not strong enough to justify spending your money on this album.Rush to get all of his catalog but, please, pass this one by."
4,Underrated,"This album comes in for so much stick, yet when you take it out of the context of Cohen's catalogue, you can see that it is a great album in it's own right. Each song is lush sounding, as though Spector is parodying himself at times with echoing drums wind sections, but the songs are suited to this. I hear after the collaborator's fall out, they were left with only guide vocals, but they more than do their job. Cohen sounds seedy, at times, a little too seedy (I Left A Woman Waiting) but you can't help but admit that this is a great collection of songs and Cohen sounds like he's having fun. Great comedy moments too here, like Bob Dylan's backing vocals on '... Hard On' and the whole everything in one pan aspect gives you the same pleasure as listening to The Clash's London Calling. Something which will appeal to even non-fans"
1,Spector's Folly,"Yes, yes. I understand that there is a certain sort of reviewer mentality that likes to defend horrific material so as to appear off-beat, hip, and exceptionally insightful. Regard the raves for Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, for example. But there IS a reason why Cohen himself disownes ""Ladies Man"", and considered taking the master tape from deranged producer Phil Spector at gunpoint. Spector's orchestral, muzak excess, as bad and inappropriate as it has ever been, combined with a mix of Cohen's vocals that make him sound like a fly trapped in a salt shaker, remove any charm that the lovely lyrics might provide. Better to just read them in one of Cohen's poetry collections.Is any of this junk salvageable? ""I Left a Woman Waiting"" (just barely) and attempted single ""Iodine"" have a glimmer. A very, very bad place for new Cohen listeners to begin.Trust me."
1,Go J.Wimmer!,"(J.Wimmer is the previous reviewer - look forward to your album Jay.) This may be the only Leonard Cohen album that I couldn't bear listening to for a third time and it ended up in my 'give away' box on the first day that I owned it. The album should have been called 'oxymoron' because the lyrics do not go with the music. All this boppy, unemotional, horny (in the musical sense) stuff doesn't suit our beloved Leonard.Thankfully, Cohen seems to have realized this very early and didn't make the same mistake again. Lucky this album didn't ruin his career though - your LC collection can do without this one."
4,cohen meets spector,"This is one of the wierdest albums ever, and worth owning even if you can't decide whether to love it or hate it.For me it is certainly one of the oddest pairings in the history of popular music with cohen's darkly intellectual and sensual understatement meeting spector's affinity for huge and often vulgar production with unpredictable results - you just couldn't make it up- God knows what they were thinking. The album is patchy, but well worth the highlights. 'Don't go home with your hard-on' is probably the only cohen track you'd be ever be able to get people to dance to, while the tite track finishes life as a kind of stoned wigout with cohhen's vocals swamped under some of the mudiest production you'll hear this side of the 1950s, but somehow it all works in some strange way. Any decade other than the 1970s and it probably wouldn't have happenend- buy it just for the sheer unlikeliness of the whole thing."
1,Phil Spector should be put out of his misery,"It's hard to imagine that this is the same Phil Spector who produced the austere and brilliant first post-Beatles John Lennon solo album. Well, it is the same Phil Spector who botched up Paul McCartney's ""Long and Winding Road"" and John Lennon's ""Across the Universe"". Leonard Cohen is in poor form here, and Phil Spector is in abysmally tasteless form. Nevertheless, one track perversely manages to come off in spite of itself: ""Paper Thin Hotel"" (not ""Paper Thin Hole"")."
2,Ruined... By Spector AND Cohen...,"Today marks the fifth time in my life that I've made an effort to enjoy Leonard Cohen's work. Having tried, on separate occasions, to sit through ""Songs of Leonard Cohen"", ""Songs from a Room"", ""Songs of Love and Hate"", and, later all of them consecutively, I had all but dismissed Cohen's work as overrated. Yes, I do recognize he writes well - but, as a musician, he just isn't compelling. Leonard Cohen's music gives you all of the catharsis of a root canal.Having enjoyed some of Phil Spector's productions a great deal, I decided I would give a chance to one last Leonard Cohen album. ""Death of a Ladies Man"" does have nice lyrics. I might, in fact, enjoy reading these words independent of this terrible music. Neither artist hits the mark on this recording and I would suggest to the potential buyer to consider ANYTHING else."
2,FINALLY DISAPOINTED BY COHENS MUSIC,"UNFURTUNETLY, NO ONE IS PERFECT, AND IN THIS CASE IT'S COHEN'S TIME TO PROVE IT. I HAVE TRIED REPETETLY TO RALLY LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM, BUT THE MORE I HERE IT, THE MORE I DISLIKE IT, THE ONLY SONG OF THE ALBUM THAT MIGHT BE WORTH CHEKING OUT CAREFULLY IS ""I LEFT A WOMAN WAITING"". MUSICALLY ITS A VERY PURE RECORD, AND LIRICALLY, I HAVE TO SAY ALL SONGS WHERE WRITEN BY COHEN AND PHIL SPECTOR, AND THAT IS BAD NEWS, IF YOU ARE A BIG FAN BUY IT, IF NOT, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. SINCERELY EDUARDO MAYER"
2,file cart,The size is perfect. The product itself is unstable and wobbly. The base clips fall off. This is not a mobile cabinet that I will use long term due to the instability.
1,A piece of junk,"I read through all the information on the seller's web page, and made sure that I would buy the correct battery for my ipod. I received this item, and the description on the battery itself also shows that I got the correct type. However the battery is bigger than the original one, I can tell just by looking at the two batteries when they are placed side by side. There is no way to place this one into the ipod. I cannot return this to the seller eforcity either as the shipping cost is so high, you will lose your money no matter what. This is a total trap. Do not make the same mistake as I do."
3,worked for a while...,"it installed perfect, it charged up and then it worked for a few months. but then my ipod died. the battery is likely still working but the ipod hard drive died. i can't say whether or not the battery is ""related"" to the ipod dying... i wish it still worked, but the battery seemed ok."
4,Good and concise,"A great book in an easy to read format, good for quick reference and deeper study. Great pictures and info on locating local specimens to see how the plants look in a real setting."
3,Storm Launcher,"The remote conrol is very difficult to manuver and master. The blades break easy and are hard to change out. The toy is very fun and can do amazing things once you get the hang of it, but it takes a lot of practice. Hence, you need to know how to fix it before you can fly it well."
3,Very Fun But Not Durable,"I tried this thing in the pool a couple times and it works perfectly but when I tried to fly it, once it took off it started going up side down and I had no control over it. When it hit the ground it just blew apart. The elevator fell off, the prop was cracked apart and this thing was unusable."
3,"Good ideas, but very outdated","Great topic, but the book was outdated. Most of the information cited in the book were for events that took place in the 1980's! That is 20 years ago! A couple of examples that he mentions took place in the early - mid 90's. Nothing recent.The material contains good comments and ideas, but don't kid yourself to think that this book contains up-to-date examples. Save the money and buy this book used (yes it is available plenty of places online used, even though the author denies it)."
1,Very bad display,"I tried the trick of resizing, but honestly, the image quality is still abyssmal. The images are so low-resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out. Please, if you're thinking of buying this for someone for Christmas this year, choose something else. It might be okay for someone with low standards or poor eyesight, but for anyone who can see well and knows what a good digital image looks like, this will be a huge disappointment.The good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance - that's almost guaranteed. So put this one on the ""must buy for mom"" list for the 2008 Christmas season.I very seldom write a review, and only wrote this one to keep people from making the same mistake I did."
3,"Handy, but low resolution","Being one who needs nothing else to make my wallet fatter (except more $), I thought a small digital viewer would be the ticket. I'll just say this ""1-inch is REALLY small!"" The low resolution makes anything other than close-up shots of loved ones pretty much un-viewable. Vistas are out of the question. But 56 (if I remember correctly) pictures of family, friends and loved ones all on a little keychain viewer is nice too. With the right type of pictures, it's an acceptable product."
1,"TAO 1""Digital Picture Keychain",Unfortunately I had to return the unit because it was not designed to be used on a Mac 10.4 program( the tech at the company said he was not aware it was meant to be used by a Mac.)
5,Wonderful!!,This rice has a light rich flavor that is a nice change from other rices I eat. VERY GOOD! The shipper mailed this to me very quickly also.
5,Forbidden Rice,"Great stuff and now on the ""hot"" list for good things to eat - i.e., dark rice. Has a great, unique taste. Recommend highly"
3,The Teachings Of Miss Ellie Ruth - Better Than I Thought,"I grew up in a small town in the 1940's. I had an immediate connection with the characters in this book. Ms. Baker's ability to weave multiple viewpoints gives the reader an honest sense of small town life in the 1940's and the internal struggle of women as they challenged the norms of society.It's obvious that Ms. Baker grew up around ""grown folks"" because she tells stories chocked full of wisdom. Her characters are people that we've all met at sometime in our life. They're real people who typically are marginalized, undervalued and underpaid (like me).I enjoyed the book."
3,No Belkin Labeling ANYWHERE,"Product was delivered quickly and efficiently. It came in a plastic bag, with a made in china label. Has no discernible Belkin label anywhere. It may well be a Belkin product, but there is nothing that would lead you to believe it really is; there is no labeling on the cable, there is no labeling on the package. The item does as it promises - provides you with a 6' cable that does work. Usually there is SOME tell...not here. It is possible belkin sells bulk cables to other manufacturers; it is possible this company may package cabling for Belkin sale and this might be that cable... I paid a bit more because I like knowing I am getting the product advertised but there isn't much to confirm that in this case."
3,"Good cable, not a Belkin","The cable is good, I was able to get sound in both the left and right channels. As far as I can tell there is nothing wrong with the cable. However, this cable is not a Belkin, which, is what they are advertising. So if you specifically want a Belkin cable I would advise looking elsewhere."
1,"defective, had to return","Mine was missing the left channel when new from the package. The return options didn't include replacement, so I ended up going to a local Radio Shack to get a headphone extension."
5,Excellent Product,"If you buy Belkin products, you are assured of performance and quality. Just the right length and would buy again,"
1,"do not buy, does not work","on the very first use, sound only comes from one side of my headphones when using this extension cable. Do not buy."
4,Does the job its meant to do. No more no less.,"My last extension cord for my headphones tore after the wife accidentally got it caught up in the vacuum cleaner. I needed a replacement but was flabbergasted at the prices the local brick and mortar stores were charging. I went online and found the Belkin Stereo Extension.This cable does the job it is meant to do with no extras. I cannot attest to the longevity of the product but it has withstood several months now of daily use without any tearing. I also do not detect any loss of quality or sound when in use.Overall, a worthwhile purchase that I am happy with."
2,Save your money,Lasted about a week before the connection within the male end failed. Sound wavers between the left and right channels. Pretty much apiece of junk. Back to Radio Shack.
1,Belkin Extension,"The only reason i bought belkin, i thought was because of its good quality, this time i was not satisfied. the extension does not give me the same effect as my bose headphones. plus the jack cannot be inserted completely, if you try that, there is no sound at all. hence you have to jimmy it for audible and acceptable sound quality, else it is just a plug. Disappointed."
1,Poor sound quality - threw it away,"Significant loss of sound quality. I can hear the instrumental portion of the music, but the singers' voice is dramatically distorted."
1,Loses one channel,"Pass on this item. It totally cuts out a whole audio channel. You can use it if you adjust your sound preferences to send all sound through one channel, making it a passable product, but I recommend skipping on something so low quality."
2,This product is not worth what it's worth,I was impressed at first until it went out on me. I opened it up and discovered that the blue shell is just a fancy cover for the few wires insides. I fixed the poor connection that fell out of place. A soldering gun should have been used. I got it working after I reconnected the loose wire but then it went out on me a second time even with all wires still intact. The stand is really nice and durable but the light is a joke. This product is not what it's worth.
3,Thought they would be bright...,"I bought these lights thinking they would be bright. I didn't thoroughly read the description I guess. This is a ""backlight"" light, meaning it just a kicker light. Not bright, but enough to fill the edge with some soft line."
2,Sterling Silver Band Citrine Gemstone Ring,I was very disappointed with this ring. The color of the stones were too yellow making the ring look like a child's prize from a dispenser.
2,Keep looking,"I bought this phone because I have been very happy with Motorola single line cordless phones. But this phone is disappointing. I'm already looking for a replacement.It does the important things well. Sound quality is good, lots of features, intuitive menu. It falls short on the little things - each one trivial by itself, but combined they are quite annoying.PRO's:Good sound qualityLots of featuresDoesn't take up too much desk spaceLarge enough to be easy to holdCON's:Menu system is slow, making speed dial frustratingShort battery lifeBase rings if a call comes in on second line, even if you're on the first lineCan't maintain separate speaker and non-speaker volumesOften indicates a message even when there is noneOther similar annoyancesI'm a big fan of Motorola phones, but this one just doesn't measure up to their usual standards."
4,I like it,The Great Wheel is a good educational book about the first Ferris Wheel. It's an easy read. We enjoyed it.
4,Never has the decline of civilization been so funny!,"Most of the essays in the book are interesting. One of essays got bogged down with a lot of fuzzy technical and philosophical arguments. Some of the essays on language use and grammar will remind you of your spinster curmudgeon English teacher; they were a bit too hard-core reactionary for me, but not without their truths. A lot of the essays exude a lot of wit and I laughed out loud in a lot of places. Particularly I liked one essay by a self-proclaimed snob who said that college was a waste of time for a lot of people and why didn't we just have college for people who are actually interested in learning for its own sake? Before WWII, people could get good jobs without having to go to college. The businesses trained them at their own expense, which is what businesses should do."
2,"Mostly ossified, with a few moments of excellence","There are not many rare, surprising or sophisticated essays in this collection. Most bore with their sclerotic whingeing. I enjoyed Slavitt, Kalfus, the writer who critiques Freudian etiology, perhaps one or two others. Simon, Lopate, and Epstein are, as usual, tedious and inflexible. Also, the preponderance of the opening quotes detailing our decline and fall were culled from the New York media complex (Times, WSJ, The New Yorker and on and on) as though nothing of interest and nobody of perspicacity could possibly exist ""out there"". This is New York provincialism at its most loathsome. This is primarily a roster of soreheads and reactionaries rehearsing thier solipsism. Pardon me if I cease to lend an ear."
2,Evidence of dumbing down,"Here's one bit of evidence of dumbing down in America: I paid money for this crabby, unscientific, pompous book. Don't make the same mistake."
5,GREAT!!,Materials cited....GREAT pictures and great information. This author did his homework and even more so with his years of experience and being in certain circles he was able to bring it all together. This was a great buy!
3,Amazing info from an insider.,"Tex Marr presents much secret info in this book based on his own experience as a Freemason. He tells you which hand signs to use to signal other magicians and Rosicrucians. Some say Marr applied for membership in the Illuminati but was rejected because he is Jewish. Others say his membership in occult organizations makes him an expert. I heard that he practices black magic, but only when no one is looking. Is he a Satanist? Some say yes, some say for sure. I once saw a picture of him making the sign of Lucifer over his crotch, meaning he could be ambiexual. Beware the horns of she-devils. Marr knows what he is talking about, and in this book he reveals all the secrets that should not be revealed. We love his books here at the asylum."
1,Destructive and Dangerous Nonsense,"Everything about this book is offensive to anyone with even a passing knowledge of history. Best classified as pseudo history, it is a complete misinterpretation of christianity, the bible, religion, fraternal organizations and the occult, espousing a point of view that perhaps can only be understood if seen through the narrowest lens of fundamentalist christianity. A lack of honest scholarship that would be laughable, if only the views contained within were not so often wielded by the christian right. That dark and ignorant nadir of destructive dominionist eschatological belief currently casting its long shadow over our beautiful earth of love and light."
1,Conservative Garbage,"This book is just an excuse to feed the uneducated right wing x-tain masses that use scaremongering tactics to poorly promote their war against the so-called new world order. Texe Marrs is nothing more than another Racist/Sexist/Anti-Gay/Anti-Occult person just out to scare people and make a quick buck. This book, as well as his other work, ""Mysterious Monuments"" is a waste of your time and your money. It is nothing more than a book of lies."
2,Super Boring!!!!!!!!!!!,"Wow! Talk about a big build up and then a huge, boring let down! I think you should buy the actual book. Kindle is not the best format for type of book. You really can not see the pictures which were an important part of the information."
1,Misleading and Poorly Researched,"This book is extremely misleading and poorly researched. I found a ridiculous number of glaring errors that could have been corrected with the slightest amount of actual research. It's also written with an extreme anti-semitic leaning.According to this book every person of note that has ever exchanged a handshake with another is a member of the terrifying ILLUMINATI! Every person that has ever crossed their arms or legs...ILLUMINATI! Every Jewish person or Qabalist...? You guessed it.Pictures of the Bush family doing the Texas A&M; ""hook 'em horns"" AT the Texas A&M; marching band is evidence of their Satan worship. Hellen Keller doing the sign language for ""I love you"" is seen as the same.Sensationalist and ludicrous trash for the lowest common denominator."
5,Comprehensive in scope.,I think from reading the book that it is very comprehensive in attempting to describe the symbolism used by occult figures. I think Mr. Mares disclaimer about not every hand position possibly being what it appears would be best emphasized by mainly focusing on the still photo shots that are intentionally posed by the elites to pass messages on magazines and in articles. I think that the devils horns symbol is used by way to many people who just want to do something cool related to their limited knowledge about hand gestures. Many people have no concept of what the Freemasons or secret societies are or their occult meanings hidden in plain sight.
2,Disaster,Bought this book for my grandson's summer reading project. It was used but condition was satisfactory for this purpose.
1,This does not work!!!!,I should have checked this at my nearest store and then bought it.I tried it with different displays...none of them identify this...It has been a complete waste for me.....
2,Half-baked,"An interesting concept that fails in delivery.Single player is entertaining, if a bit repetitive. Interesting weapon concepts but not well-developed... coupled with poor enemy AI, and less-than-helpful allies (who often step into your line of fire and get themselves killed) makes the experience unsatisfying.Occasional bugs and crass, off-color humor throughout detract from the fun.Overall: a few cheap laughs without a lot of replay value. Could have used a bit more refining before release. Good for a weekend diversion but don't pay a lot for it."
4,A nice change from the same ol' shooter...,"As soon as I read about the Topsy Turvy gun, I knew I had to try this game. I have not been disappointed at all.For those of you who are tired of all of the WWII games or any game with the same old selection of weapons, you need to try this game. It will spring new life into your love of shooters.Just the Sticky Bombs alone had me hooked in the first 2 minutes.The humor is excellent. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the lack of multiplayer."
3,"Does the job, but","I wanted a filing cart that would allow me to keep my desk clearer, yet allow me easy access to projects I am currently working on - and it does this job well. However, it is ""wobbly"" which makes it a bit of a challenge to roll around my small office - so I just roll me in my desk chair to it."
5,"Some of my favorite ""back roads"" to explore on bike!","Last night I did all my cross-training on various machines to the Bike-O-Vision Cycling Journey - South Carolina Backroads.After 15 or maybe 30 minutes, I was ready to come in and write a review that said, ""Beautiful back roads, lots of green trees, but rather boring, not my favorite Bike-O-Vision trip.""Right after thinking those thoughts, the trip changed. We went up King Mountain. We went to little resort towns. Then, my beautiful little town of Beaufort where I've only lived in my imagination, but love it anyway! Then more towns that are just a joy to bicycle through.Don't give up and think that the long, L-O-N-G, roads at the beginning are all of it. They saved the best for last! Next time I think I'll go straight to the Beaufort part. Loved it!"
3,ok item,"This spinner works as it is supposed to, but after having it outside for a few months, even after waxing, the underside is pitting and rusting. I thought that copper did NOT rust?"
3,Copper Plated Metal,"This item looks and works great.I am only giving it three stars because of the items description.This item is copper plated metal,not pure copper.On the box are the words Cosmix and Red Carpet Studios.Same Company as Cosmix Helix?"
5,"14"" Double Helix Copper Wind Spinner",I gave this as a gift. The recipient was delighted with it. It arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition.
1,Modern day Nancy Drew gone awry.,"Was it a mystery, romance, travel guide?? Clearly the author couldn't make up her mind. The beginning hinted of mystery and romance, the middle took the various aspects off on their own dead-end paths, the end just became a silly summation of misunderstandings and pathetic introspection. It was, however, ironic that the center of the plot was an American author writing insipid novels for masses of inept readers. I feel like I've been had in buying this book. If you must subject yourself - borrow it from the library."
1,"Not worth your money, time or bookshelf space!","If you love Italy, romance, mystery or good writing, you won't like this book. The critics must have read a different book than I did. Let me offer a contrast between their views and mine: Theirs - ""A rich Italian tapestry of a novel."" Mine - ""A threadbare story written in shades of beige."" Theirs - ""Smart, taut tale."" Mine - ""Simple, unadorned writing."" Theirs - ""Funny, insightful tale of an American abroad."" Mine - ""Disconnected, shallow tale of a stereo-typical American woman in her 30's."" Theirs - ""Seamless narrative, remind[ing] us of the power of art to alter our lives."" Mine - ""A valiant but unsuccessful attempt to weave art and travel into an uninspired story."" Theirs - ""A pleasure that sticks to and tickles the ribs."" Mine - ""A light, facile read that will be forgotten before week's end.""I really wanted to like this book. There just wasn't anything in it for me to enjoy. It certainly isn't a bad book. But it isn't a good one either."
2,A mediocre red at best,"Italian Fever was pretty disappointing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never really did. The characters where bland and the story line seemed to be leading to an exciting ended which turned out to be no big deal. Don't waste your time with so many other good books out there."
4,Even the digressions are interesting,"You must wonder if we are all reading the same book. It shows how much individual experiences influence the literary experience. I thought this book was charming - I love the way it evoked Italy - the not-so-pleasant as well as the wonderful and I liked the way it mirrored life - getting horribly sick when you should be having a great time - having a love affair turn to recrimination and confusion almost before if gets off the ground and, of course, stumbling along where the Roman legions marched, trying to make sense of it all."
3,Hoping for a recovery.,"When I read the beginning of Italian Fever, I knew I would expect more. There was suspense, chaos, turmoil. Although I appreciate the references to the masterpieces of Italian art in the rest of the work, references that brought me back in memory to places I had been, in many ways I was let down. Nothing came of the gripping beginning. There is also a lacuna between Lucy and what DV had become, even in the end.I did appreciate the way some characters developed. I was pleased to see Antonio Cini develop a relationship with Lucy after such a difficult beginning. I wonder if the author is saying that most Italian men are like Massimo. The plot hung well, moved well, and I expected a thrilling climax, in light of the found manuscript. It did not transpire.I may give Valerie Martin another chance."
2,Pleasant enough but not much happens,"This book kind of reminded me of 'Room With A View' full of pleasant characters set in Italy but nothing much happens and the reader is left unsatisfied by the end. Unfortunately the writer didn't use her skills to inject any drama, or suspence or twists into the narrative."
2,preciise but deteriorable.,"Although the product was kind of accurate, the velcro deteriorates rapidly and irreversibly, therefore the wear and tear is""awesome' and the only alternative is to use to buy another one and use the parts in case of needs. Not worth the money."
4,not that sticky,"Like a lot of people have said, the velcro is good but the adhesive is not. I tried to use it to hold up a couple of light weight plastic trim pieces in my truck. The pieces fell down; the velcro was still stuck to each other but the adhesive part was no longer stuck to the truck. Maybe good for some applications to keep things from sliding but not that good to hold things up."
5,Larger Velcro Pack,"When you need longer strips, this is the way to go. Industrial strength is very heavy duty and I ordered this in addition to the smaller strips. Now I have a good supply on hand for when I need it. This saves a trip to the store."
5,Great all Around,"This product is low cost but very durable, I used it to help with cable management behind my computer desk."
1,Do not use,"I purchased this because i have concrete walls and cant use nails to hang lighter things. Excited, i put up all the things i needed on the walls....never anything heavy or with any weight at all. Now everything has come crashing to the floor and is broken. Buy at your own risk."
4,For the big jobs,"We used this to cut a flap/door on the top of a pet-tube carrier. The carrier had only access on the ends and fills the entire back seat of the truck. The cats could not push their way out the Velcro door on top, But we could open it, without having to stop the vehicle and open the doors."
2,Velcro works adhesive doesn't,"I bought it to use on my dashboard in the car. I'm in the Seattle area, not a terribly warm climate and any of the velcro exposed to direct sunlight on any given day just wrecks any sticking ability it had. It just makes a mess of things. Need to get something better for this use. Used indoors works as it should."
2,not strong enough,"I bought this product on the strength of it being industrial grade.Sadly it did not measure up to it5s description, after two days use it started to come unstuck.Had I known this would happen I would not have purchased it."
1,Its takes the paint off the walls.,"I bought this because I did not want to make holes in my apartment wall for my pictures, but it took the paint off the walls. Plus I used to hang a clock and the velcro did not hold and fell down and my clock broke. I should have just used a nail. Regret buying this."
3,"Great velcro, terrible adhesive","I guess it may have just been the velcro that i got, but the adhesive on the back was absolutely terrible. You may want to get some superglue ro make sure it sticks! The front side is great. It's not prickly like most and is very strong, but pulls the actual velcro right off whatever it is on."
3,Have had great success and not so great with this product,"I went crazy and ordered a bunch of these and used it all over our building and even in my home. Works great on some surfaces but the adhesive is definatley flawed and needs to be fixed in manufacturing. 2 problems: if under pressure, it WILL most certainly eventually come off. Secondly the adhesive, if heated or cooled will adhere to the plastic backing and come off on it instead of the velcro when you go to use it. This happened in my home, not in a furnace so there's clearly some serious quality control issue here."
5,Holds Great,Bought this to mount electronic equipment. Best product ever. I am thankful this is industrial strength. Velcro is always the answer!
5,I love Velcro,"Who invented Velcro, will have my deep respect, I can't live my home life without using Velcro as solution and this one is affordable and so sticky one, I love it guys !!"
3,Doesn't stick when temperature is low 50's,"I tried using the product the other day when it was sunny and 53 degrees. The peel off sticky backing does not stick at all. I have some things I want to stick on my boat so I don't have the option of applying it indoors. I am going to wait until it warms up to try again. For now, the product is useless to me. On the bright side, the Velcro seems fine."
4,"Good stuff, good price","Very sticky. I used most of the pack on my project and it worked fine. You have to wonder if this is really ""industrial"". Have you ever gotten a little Velcro with your E-ZPass (highway toll) transponder. That's what I call industrial, but I doubt you could get this much for the same price."
4,Good quality velcro but adhesive is weak,"Bought this product to use to hold my guitar effect pedals to my pedal board, the velcro is quite strong but the adhesive is pretty lame. I would beef it up if you want to use this product for any serious purposes."
5,less build up of fuzz than regular hooks,I use this to hold therapy magnets in place and the hooks do not build up fuzz as much as regular Velcro.
5,fantastic!,i still have tape left. very durable compared to other products I've used. It sticks - takes some pressure to get the velcro off of products. I've used it to stick everything from IR cables to 5 port switches.
5,It works.,"If you need to temporarily attach something small to a stationary object, this is the product you're looking for. The glue side is sticky enough to hold an 8 port switch to my wall and the velcro side is on par with any other velcro I've used."
5,very pleased,"I can not tell you how pleased I was with my recent purchase of Mark Hampton: The Art of Friendship. I wanted a first edition copy as a gift for a friend, and the condition of the purchase was excellent. I must admit I was very upset when I saw the package forced into my mail box by my mail carrier. I had to bend my mailbox to get the book out. I thought for sure the book would be damaged and I would have to find another copy. I was delighted to find that due to an inner chip board envelope, the book arrived unharmed. Thank you for a great experience!"
5,The Song Remains the Same only this time it's Unledded,"Finally, page and plant reunite to do an MTV unledded...I would not have missed this for the world. Led Zeppelin was gone before I every had a chance to see them, this allowed me that oppertunity. Like everyone else, I too was waiting. The egyptian players are fantastic, and page and plate are great. Gallow Pole is a rocker, and you will find that the part you never heard in Thank You is original, it is on BBC release. I am excited to add info to one of the greatest rock bands ever. I too wish JPJ and Jason could have been there. scott Humphrey"
5,Awesome all around,"video, audio quality are extreamly clean, on a good system this dvd will be ultra engaging. Song selection and location is very neat. This dvd and Roger Waters in the Flesh will leave you drooling"
5,AWESOME BEYOND WORDS,This is one of the best concert dvd's that I have ever watched and I am not a huge fan of Led Zepplan. Definitly worth the buy!!!
4,Worth the Quarter and Then Some,"This is a nice music video. I have never seen Led Zeppelin in concert but recently got a DVD Player and am looking forward to ordering more concert videos. Of course Led Zeppelin is the greatest and I wouldn't expect any less of them but I enjoyed the footage of the places they toured and the additional musicians added in. Very tribal and groovy. The choice of songs performed is inclusive, for me the best being ""Thank You"" and ""When the Levy Breaks."" I'd like to say, ""It Rocked!!"" but it's just not that kind of recording. The settings are beautiful and who can resist Jimmy Page's sweet, humble smile as he sweats through it all. Well, not me."
3,I wish I could give it 5 stars,"Very well put together and enjoying to see. 1 star missing is due to the fact that John Paul Jones isn't in it. The other star missing is due to their new songs on there which are, in my opinion, sloppy. But besides that, it was a good film!"
3,Good on VHS - please please release on DVD,I love the remakes the most - but why would it not be on DVD!
1,Overrated,When I read the reviews I thought it would have clean recording and video of classic Led Zep. It's Robert Plants mid eastern or North afican type spin on the classics. In my opinion They kind of ruin the classics. I say don't waste your money unless you like sitars. There are a few good tracks but I disappointed. As I was when I say plants band of joy tour. It was the same stuff. Page still rocks Plants not into it anymore.the DVD Led Zeppelin (2003) is the best. It's worth the money
2,I taped this off PBS for free,"so why buy it? And they couldn't find John Paul Jones' phone number? And Robert Plant appears to have lost much of his upper range, which would explain why he now sings with Alison Krauss (she sings the high notes he can't hit anymore)"
3,how do you wear out a CD,"I've got a question for the the reviewer who claims that he wore out a cd. I've got cd's that I purchased 18 years ago and they still play like their brand new. Anyways, this show and cd are great, but it's only half of Led Zeppelin and to rewrite history and act like Page and Plant were the band is an insult to Bonham and Jones. It's a nice show but compare it to live DVD and you'll know what I mean. I would rather they released the full concerts on DVD that are represented in edited form on last years package (Earls Court and Knebworth)."
1,confusing,"you need 2 be very careful buying video from this company overseas...it wont work in your machine!!!and their miniscule warning is very easy 2 miss when u finally figure it out, they say 2 bad so sad we warned u suck it up.....never again!tjc"
2,Jimmy Page on xanax,"Very disapointed. Couldn't even watch the whole thing. Led Z moves me, this tapes left me cold."
5,S. SHOLLY REVIEW IS NUTS!,"Hey who ever is this S. Sholly person who wrote the bad review should really pay attention. Jimmy Page always mixes and masters all the Zep recordings, so you must not know anything as you claim these mixes were good on the CD and VHS, but not on this new DVD. Guess what, it was the same person who did all these releases. Folks who do not work in the music business should stay home and not write bad reviews about sound quality because they must have a cheap $5.00 mono player!"
3,it's ok,"not quite what i expected...the music is great of course, but it feels like i'm watching an extended music video on mtv"
5,These are great!,I got these to use for salad dressing that separates and they work great. I can shake up the dressing without any spills. Great!
2,scrapes OK but isn't wide enough,"I much prefer the wider Tongue Cleaner by Tongue Cleaner Company, [..] It's open design works well. A couple of scrapes by it and I'm ready to rinse.With this one, I'm not comfortable that I've really covered all the surfaces even after multiple scrapes.I was very unimpressed by their recommendation to buy a new one in 3 months because the scraping edge would become dull. My other one is still going strong after years. I only bought this one for my travel bag.P.S. I like to pop these in the dishwasher periodically for an extra clean washing."
5,Dawn of Nilsson,"I really like this C.D. I am a big Nilsson fan and found several songs that I really liked on this C.D. This collection really does show the real range of Nilssons' voice. however these are basically high quality demo tapes, no false starts or studio chatter, just basically Nilsson and a acoustic guitar unplugged. lets also remember that Nilson was only 17 years old when he recorded this, to me thats pretty impressive."
5,Ageless Hero,"I highly recommend this book for both adults and children. The story is educational & exciting, and the pictures are beautiful. This is absolutely a great gift for anyone."
5,Introduce Shahnameh to your kids - they will Love It!,"My son was so excited about this comic book that he made me read it to him (at bed time) everynight for 3 weeks! In fact, he has memorized the text and giggles at the same parts everytime. He is facinated about the father son dynamics and a story which includes Persian Heros. Perfect way to introduce Shahnameh stories to your kids and give them pride in their heritage."
5,THIS IS THE WAY TO GO!!!,"If you are looking for an HD-Ready TV, let me say that i was blown away by this one! I'd been searching for an HDTV for almost a year and a half, and when I found this one, i knew the search was over! Not only was i looking for a TV that would be ""top of the line"" in its technology, ablilities/features (it even has a PC input for computer link-up!), and most importantly its picture an sound quality, i also wanted a TV that would compliment any modern-looking room or apartment with a great looking, modern design. When I got this TV it not only had everything i was looking for in its features and abilities, it was gloriously beautiful in every way! With its stunning picture and design, this HDTV truly brings the ""television set"" into the 21st century in a big way! This one comes stock with its own bragging rights! I would give this one 6 stars if I could. You can't go wrong with this one my friend, its absolutely amazing!"
3,Lights do not work on all,"I purchased 2 sets (8 lights total). Currently only 6 work. Originally only 5 lit up (after a couple days of the sun charging them) until I aggressively shook the 6th one and now that one works. The remaining two are duds. You must be gentle when placing into the ground because the plastic stand breaks easily. Although they look very nice, I am very disappointed that two do not work."
4,Nice design very cool looking,"As with most solar lamps, these are not designed to illuminate your walk way. They do provide some light but buyers must realize that these are mainly for decorative use. They are beautiful to look at both at night and during the day. Know what to expect before you buy these things. You could spend alot of money on the metal ones and they won't be any brighter than these. My friend has the $80 a piece metal set and his do not do any better than mine."
1,Really cool looking but do not last,Bought in April 2011. Here I am in February 2012 and had to buy replacements. Tried changing out batteries but nothing.They do look great lit when working and look good when not lit. However they do not last.Look elsewhere.
2,Bad quality of construction,"I do really like the designs of this item, however the quality of this products is horrible and it doesn't light up bright at all. I do hope Target is giving us better quality product."
5,These are my favorite sticks!,"In over 40 years of set drumming I have experimented with many sizes and weights of sticks. These are my favorite. They are a bit lighter than hickory but that helps with speed of movement. They won't hold up to working cymbal edges as they are a bit softer wood than hickory. But that is the only drawback. I play everything from country, jazz, rock and roll, big band swing, etc. They are the best. I prefer the nylon tip as I can get a real good sound from cymbals with a softer touch and volume when needed."
3,Price is very high in amazon,The price quoted in amazon is too high. It is available for a far less price in outlet malls. I got a 3.4 Oz for $14.
3,Pretty good,"I also did not find this to be strongly scented and having read the previous reviews, was a little disappointed with the product. It does smell good, but not as strongly as I had hoped, and cleans very well. I find it a little drying, however, and had I known, would have purchased a different product. They do include samples of some of their other products and having used those, found the shampoo, conditioner, body wash combo to be better for my skin and hair. Will I purchase a philosophy product for myself again? Maybe. Will I be happy to recieve it as a gift? Absolutely."
3,"Great smell, but pricey","I LOVE the smell of this Philosophy body wash! It's a great pick-me-up in the mornings! However, the smell doesn't last after the shower, and I think it's more expensive than what it's worth. I couldn't even use the last part of the liquid because the thick plastic of the bottle wouldn't let me squeeze it out. I ended up just tossing it out with at least 1/4 of liquid left inside."
5,Can't get enough,I'm an avid fan and this was an excellent addition to my collection. I love the improvisation and the commentary and it's fun to listen to the songs on this album back to back with the original recording of the same song to hear how it compares and contrasts. Still waiting for the Purple album...
3,Unreleased Wakeman from 1974!,"Hard to believe-- but Wakeman's epic JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH was intended to be a studio album. THE PRIVATE COLLECTION opens with the previously-unreleased original version of ""The Battle"", giving fans a glimpse of what might have been. Considering how many times in the last 10 years Rick HAS redone this and its related pieces, both live and in studio, one wonders why he doesn't just leave well enough alone!The remainder of this album are a set of instrumentals that Rick played on live on the tour to promote JOURNEY..., making this a sort-of before-and-after bookends for that album. There's some nice stuff here (the aggressive ""Warmongers"" a standout) but too much of it just doesn't stick in my head, even after repeated listening. Except for the closer-- ""And Now A Word From Our Sponsor"", which includes the no-doubt-world-famous jingle, ""Things Go Better With Coke""!"
4,fun,I thought the adventures in here were good. Some of my pcs died quite quickly after meeting some of the nasty monsters in these adventures.
2,Dated,"Well the book is well written, unfortunatly it is somewhat dated by more recent work. The fact is there are more up to date books available, but it might serve as a good introduction to anyone without genetic background."
4,A real glimpse of the Norwegian-American heritage at Christmas!,"This is a really nifty, comb-bound book. It was published by the Seattle Sons of Norway (back of the book says for more copies, contact them at 206-784-6181 or Leikarringen of Leif Erikson Lodge No. 1, 2245 NW 57th, Seattle, WA 98107), and it has information on Norwegian-American Christmas (Jultid)traditions, recipes, crafts, carols, and information. I was particularly taken with the information about Primstaven, the old Norwegian calendar sticks that predated the use of modern paper calendars. A fascinating find!"
1,Bad evidence and faulty logic result in a poor argument.,"I consider Kinman's attempt to explain ""The New World Order"" a comedy. Kinman's idea of ""proof"" consists of unsubstantiated ""facts"" followed by questionable interpretations. For example, if you look at the context of many of his quotes pertaining to the UN Charter, you can see that the stated purpose, goals, and methods of the UN are nothing like whate Kinman tries to plant in your mind. The outlandish claims, quasi-based on the Bible, (a version of) history, and current events ring of lunacy.As with anything, read it with a critical eye."
5,A Spiritual Rock Masterpiece,"If you like spiritual music with a rock beat then you will love African Bach. This is a collection of songs about hope which are sung by the phenomenal Roy Astley. The tight rock band really blasts on ""African Bach"" ""Liberty"" ""Face in the Crowd"" and ""Don't Touch the Merchandise"" The softer songs like ""My Homeland"" ""Anthem"" and ""Africa East"" are just as powerful as they convey a message which cannot be ignored which is that we always need to think of helping others who are not as fortunate as we. I am a Rick Wakeman fanatic and ""African Bach"" is without doubt one of my favorite works by this legendary and virtuoso keyboardsman."
1,"Huge disappointment. Agitation, not the Rick's music.","Come on, dear fans, is it masterpiece? Does it have 5 starts rate? Then what about King Arthur or Jorney? Well, considering it as a pop album it's ok. But I'm as Rick and Yes fun expected a little bit more. The CD is just ""red"" agition, propaganda, no more! 5% of music and 95% just political calls and mottos. So boring! Poor and pretty silly pop with women's chorus and lot of words like ""revolution"", ""freedom"", ""fight"". Replete Englishmen fight for freedom under the red flag. That's fun! ... So, I returned this CD ... after 3 listening. I hoped I find something similar to Rick's ""goldern era"". Nothing, but couple of chords..."
1,Bleh AWFUL,"Bleh, these are AWFUL.I ordered a pack and a pack of the HP screen protectors.The Belkin's use a non permanent adhesive that no matter how much you smooth it, give your screen a gnarly look. While this holds well, it looks terrible.The HP protectors have NO adhesive but are held in by tension on the edges. These produce no screen artifacts while looking great."
4,Very emotive covers of some standard tunes,"Look, Boots Randolph hardly pushed saxophony into new dimensions, but the guy has a style and he's a good study in adding emotive content to horn playing. One also gets a chance to hear more than Randolph's pop-music activity on the apparatus; he actually does some interesting improv here and there, and shows that he does, indeed, have some technique to show off."
2,SO Disappointed - should have paid closer attention to the other reviews!,"The quality of this toy is terrible! The latches on the back of the firetruck don't close properly, which makes it difficult to keep the back of the truck closed. Why is this so important? My 4 year old absolutely LOVES cars & trucks where the doors/hood/trunk open and close...to have one where the doors are supposed to open, but don't close properly is disappointing to him. As my son indicated when we first took it out of the box, the back wheels don't turn! It's not possible to get one of the action figures to actually turn the crank with his arms on it...it's a flimsy piece of plastic as compared to some of the other rescue vehicles...for something so important as a fire truck (all little 3 & 4 year old boys know what fire trucks are and do, and mine is pretty excited by the real ones), Fisher Price certainly missed the boat on this one! Go back to the drawing board, and get it right next time!"
2,Disappointed in quality,"Overall FP toys have been very hit or miss the last few years. Little people were poorly designed a few years ago, but seem to be better now. Rescue Hero stuff seems to have been good the last few years, and terrible this year. Construction of this has problems: the plastic is thinner than rescue hero stuff has been in the past, and both the doors of the truck won't stay closed at the same time. The latches designed to keep it closed just don't work right. Also, when the special Action Max Billy Blazes with floppy arms-- which we had to buy separatly-- is put in the truck to turn the crank, there is no notch to hold him in by his backpack connection, so when his arms turn, he comes out of the truck head first. Another miss by fisher price. My 3 year old is very frustrated with this toy. We also got the jet hq, and the legs on it are weak, and the plastic body is also too thin, but otherwise it seems acceptable, better than this truck."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY WASTE OF MONEY,This toy is not well built and I wish I would of read the reviews before purchasing. The backdoor latch broke within 5 minutes of using this toy - My son was so excited he loves fire trucks - The Rescue Heroes figures are great because they are the perfect size for little hands.
2,Is this Fisher-Price?,"I bought this fire truck for my grandson's fifth birthday,I bought the Rescue Heroes for Christmas. It really is not very sturdy, the doors do not stay closed, the ladder doesn't twirl all the time, the Rescue Heroes steering gadget doesn't always work, sometimes yes, sometimes no. However, my grandson is thrilled just to have it and plays with it and all its faults."
1,Do not buy,My son received this for Christmas and the toy was already broken when we took it out of the box. For $30 it isn't worth the money.
2,"Looks are deceiving, what a huge disappointment!","This was our first encounter with the FP Rescue Heroes. My husband, myself and my child were all very disappointed Christmas morning. This toy looks very tough and rugged, quite cool to be exact but you get it out of the box and the only impressive thing it does is the ladder turns...wow wee! Whoever imagined this toy went out on a coffee break during the creation and manufacturing meeting and never came back."
1,HUGE disappointment,"This is our first experience with Rescue Heroes and we are greatly unsatisfied. My son asked for Rescue Heroes as his number one Christmas present, and we had heard great things about them from friends, so we were excited to begin collecting these. The fire truck is just junk. The figure will not turn the crank, if we do get him in there correctly (which I'd like to see a three year old that could do that) he flips over the top. The truck is flimsy. It's sad because my son tries to play with it and enjoy it, but he becomes frustrated pretty quickly and moves on to something else. DO NOT BUY THIS LINE OF TOYS. IF Rescue Heroes have been good products in the past, then go to EBay and purchase the older ones, that is what I plan on doing next time."
3,Not Bad at all!,"The order came super fast to my door step, an just in time for the performance. Set-up and take down is simple, but the fog likes to warm up at it's own pace. Thank God it worked out right, but I was on pins and needles hopeing it would be ready at the right moment of the performance."
1,A Disappointment,"While the content of the book was quite interesting, all the author did was combine Plato's dialogues of Timaeus and Critias which are free in various formats on the Internet. I already had them and was expecting more than a mere title change. The author's opinion of Plato's work can be viewed on the back cover where he quotes Socrates in bold italics ""... what a lot of lies this young man is telling about me!"" As far as I see it, he is merely using the popularity of the name Atlantis to fund a self-publishing enterprise. P.S. Kudos to Plato."
5,VERY INTERESTING STORY TO READ,I love reading information not widely available and of such historical significance. WISH THERE WAS MORE INFO.Great price. also
5,I've learned a lot of excel tips,I got this just for the excel training but there are a lot of training videos on several other topics. The excel tutorial is about 4 hours long. I really like it.
5,Replacement pump,"I purchased this pump to replace the one we had in a "" waterfall"" table. It is exactly the same model that we previously had, so it works beautifully! So glad I found it online. We are very pleased with this purchase."
3,Scout Movie,"I enjoyed this. I think anyone involved in scouts or into westerns would appreciate this movie. The quality of the video is low, because it seems to have been transferred from old film."
2,Tex Rides With The Boy Scouts,The story line was pretty lame. The acting was fairly poor. But the Scout uniforms and activities were awesome to see if you are an avid Scouter.
3,Boy Scout Movie,"I enjoyed this movie, because I am involved in scouts. Anyone into scouts and history will like this movie. The quality of the transfer is low, but I still enjoyed."
4,Take Along Fun,I bought this for the neighbor. They take it to restaurants to pass the time with a 5 year old and say it is fun for the child.
3,Good introduction to product line engineering,"This book gives a good introduction to product line engineering (PLE). It highlights many of the problems and possibilities with PLE. The orthogonal variability model gives a ""clean"" view of variation points and variants.The book is on a too high level for me and it does not go deeper into the subject of PLE. The orthogonal variability model works with the simple examples in the book but in real life applications it will soon be very hard to realize the model.I can still recommend this book to anyone that wants a good introduction to PLE."
4,Turbo works great,Booster seat is great for my 2 1/2 year old. She can still seem to get her arm out even after tighten the seat belt but overall I like it. The fabric cleans up great and it leans back for a little for naps.
4,Great seat for the money,"My daughter will be four in a few months and is very tall for her age. The convertible car seat that we just switched from was too constricting and uncomfortable for her. I have been happy with this car seat so far. If she falls asleep though, she tends to hang over to one side. The only thing I would suggest is checking your seat belts to see if when they are pulled to the maximum length, is if they snap back in and lock. This seat seems to only work on those types of seat belts. If you have to adjust it manually, it would loosen too easily, which is the problem my mom is having with hers. We will have to get a different model for her car. Overall, happy with this seat though. And so is my daughter, as she feels like a BIG KID now."
5,Just like the old CCR days,For many the break up of Creedence Clearwater in 1973 was a dark day. John Fogerty since then hadnt done alot.in the early 80's he was finallly back on track with this album.John Fogerty reclaimed his spot as one of the premiere writers and performers in American and the world for that matter.This CD is full of great songs and a major hit for him.The Old Man Down the Road was a hit for him and received air play on MTV at the time.Rock and Roll Girls is another great song in the CCR mode.Big Train from Memphis is a personal favorite that I play over and over.I saw it on TV is a great song about how we watched news in the 60's on TV. He deals with the JFK shooting and other important stories of the time.Centerfield was his blockbuster hit that we still hear every baseball season and shows Fogerty in top form.This album is as good (if not better) than most CCR albums.If you like Fogerty or CCR this album is for you.
3,Buy Blue Moon Swamp first,"Don't get me wrong, this is a CD worth buying, but if you've got a choice between Fogerty tunes, go for Blue Moon first.And the other reviews that mention the strangeness of the drum machines couldn't be more right. This sounds pretty bad, especially on tracks like ""Centerfield"", at least until the song gets into full swing."
4,some flaws..but great singles,"when this album first came out i really enjoyed it..however looking now at the song list i realized it was 4 0r 5 songs that i liked. And great songs they are..centerfield,big train,saw it on t.v.,and rock and roll girls. Even a dozen years later i still remember them. this album is not as good as blue moon swamp but still worth a listen"
4,"Not quite up to the best of Creedence, but then again....","This is easily Fogerty's finest work solo even though some of it is a bit derivative (""Old Man"" from CCR's own ""Run Through The Jungle""!, ""Rock and Roll Girls"" from the Cars' ""My Best Friends Girl""). Only real complaint is the fact that Fogerty chickened out on Vanz Kant Danz(originally called Zanz Kant Danz after Fantasy Records head Saul Zaentz); he makes up for it with Mr. Greed aimed at the same Zaentz"
4,"brilliant and subtle take on hypocricy and deceit on""TV""","I recently purchased used cassete specifically for saw it on tv. it made me reflect on his masterful subserviseness and his diversionary tactics used to slip his contraversial material past would be censors in the ccr days. But being overly obsessive about lyrical meaning, I would appreciate any feedback on a couple of lines in the song. Is he sort of calling Ike a hypocrite pertainiing beware the... comments with the big black limousine phrase. And also, I don't quite get the chained my mind to an endless tomb and took my only son from me. And the ""cover"" was it a specific incident? He was way ahead of the curve in the ""American Dream"" motif as anyoune who listens to alt country knows is probably the main theme of the genre."
3,Pale Simulacrum,"I am sorry to disagree with all the Fogerty fans, whose reviews seduced me into buying this album. I loved Creedence, I admire Fogerty's purity and ideals, but this is simply a very weak album, in my opinion. Track 2 has some interesting vocal semi-yodels, something I'd never heard him do before. He has kept his voice, but he seems stuck in the past. Mr. Greed is simply childish, musically and lyrically. Vantz Can't Danz is dull. Most of the album is an attempt to recreate the past, the glory days with Creedence Clearwater Revival, but without the vocals. None of these songs seemed very thrilling or adventurous to me. Again, sorry. I wish Fogerty and his fans well, but this is a tepid album."
1,Horrible 80s thing,"John Fogerty WAS CCR. But now he just sounds like someone doing a bad impression of them. Maybe he was just out of the game for too long.There is a great game you can play whilst listening to this album - singing the CCR classics over the rip off tunes. Didn't Fogerty get sued for his songs being too similar to his old stuff?He'd not released an album for 10 years. What was he doing? Not writing songs. He obviously forgot that he was a songwriter, and had to crib this stuff off his classics at the last minute. This really is a disappointment."
2,"Don't Waste Your Money ""Premonition Is the Best DVD J-F Made","DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY CD'S OR DVD'S JOHN FOGERTY HAS MADE.PREMONITION IS BY FAR THE MOST EXCELLENT OF ALL HIS DVD'S.THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER ONE TO TAKE IT'S PLACE.HAVE IT LOVE IT.NOTHING I EVER BOUGHT IN DVD'S"" BY JOHN FOGERTY WILL COMPARE TO PREMONITION.I GIVE IT A 10 PLUS."
5,"A Unique Sound, Great Guitar Work And A Singer With A Social Conscience!","This album shows just what a unique talent John Fogerty truly is. He goes from the Country ""chicken pickin' guitar work on Big Train( From Memphis) all the way to the hard rocking Mr. Greed in which he lashes out at the way he was treated by certain record executives. I am also happy to say that his Anti War stance is alive and well as can be heard on the song ""I Saw It On TV"" where a Father grieves the loss of his son in a futile and unnecessary war which only boosted Corporate Profits.This album should be compulsory listening for any teenage aspiring guitarists and songwriters.Mr. Fogerty may have grown up in California but his heart is still in the Louisianna Bayous. Naturally 5 stars for this album and I would give it 10 if I could."
5,"""Centerfield"" John Fogarty","""Centerfield', by john Fogarty has always been one of my favorite baseball-related pieces, and I am looking forward to playing it at the opening of the 2009 Baseball season."
3,"Comeback, part 1.","This was a triumphant return for Fogerty in 1985 after being away for 10 years. He promptly put on three classics (""The Old Man Down the Road"", ""Rock 'n' Roll Girls"" and ""Centerfield"") as well as other good songs (""I Saw it on T.V.""). However, it does sound a little dated with the one-man-band approach and the use of drum machines. Some parts come across a little thin and don't hold up well. His guitar playing is as good as ever and his distinctive voice was a welcome reprieve from what was coming out in music at that time. A good album by Fogerty."
2,Not the book pictured,Book did not match with the dictionary pictured.Book that I actually received was over-priced.Thought I was getting the Complete Kiwi Slang Dictionary
5,This book is sooooo awesome!,"I love this book. It reaches deep into the soul of the reader and MJ! I'm waiting for the sequel! (hint, hint)"
3,Convenient and smells nice.,"I've previously mostly used Cascade powder for dishes, but decided to try these because I like Method's other products. The cucumber smell is nice, but the cleaning performance isn't quite up to regular powder. I've had a few occasions where soap remained on glasses, and some food residue remained. Generally, I'm happy with it, but I watch for it on sale rather than buying at full price."
4,Great product,"I do rinse my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, but it works great. itCleans it well without leaving any residue. I run my dishwasher with just vinegar(w/o dishes) every 2 weeks to clean it and I think that makes the dish cubes work better when comes time to washing the dishes."
3,Disappointing,I was disappointed when this detergent didn't meet up to my expectations. I use several Method products and like them very much. These just don't seem to clean the dishes as well as I'd hoped.
5,Common Sense Personified,"I was expecting a book that dealt in theory. This one was surely a surprise, for it offers such a practical approach to parenting that everyone can understand it, a marvel in this world of complicated solutions. I'm sure this book will be appreciated by my daughter who is now struggling with a first grader. This is one gift I can give her that will be of use for many years."
1,Overpriced Common Sense,"This book was given as a gift to me, and frankly there's nothing wrong with anything it suggests. However, this skinny, little paperback book is only useful to those who lack any common sense. The author says things such as ""realize you, the parent, are key!"" and ""exhibit respectful behaviors at home""...geez, no kidding. The author means well, but I can't believe this book has a price of ..... I have never seen a paperback book of this size with such a high price tag (which is the main reason I am bothering to write this review). This book is not worth more than a few bucks, at most."
3,Helpful for beginner and intermediate,Very good starting hand coverage and how to play afterward. The problem with the book is it's not very orginized. Lots of examples and why plays were made.It's a good book for your poker library but should not be the ONLY book.
3,The tube was not the same,"The tube that is in the picture is not the same as what I've received. Even though is same product , So I didnt really mind."
5,Masterful music,"Kris Kristofferson is one of that small group of musicians (like Bob Marley) who transcends the musical genre he is generally said to belong to and who should therefore appeal to anybody who appreciates great music. His music is so, so much more than country music: it is lyrics verging on poetry sung beautifully to incredibly catchy tunes. The songs on this album are all in the good-to-great category, but my particular favourite is the classic Sunday Morning Coming Down. I also love the humour in Kristofferson's lyrics, which he fortunately performs in such a way that every word is clearly audible. I defy anybody not to smile upon listening to the lyrics of Best Of All Possible Worlds.In short, an artist whose music should be in every music lover's collection. Do not be put off by the country label- Kristofferson is a musical genius."
4,"Great general ""daily meditations"" book","This is a great little book with uplifting thoughts about spirituality. Good for people who are not necessarily in recovery but enjoy daily meditations. (Of course, people in recovery can get a lot out of it -- it just lacks the ""recovery slogans"" that are present in so many books of this type.) There is also practical self-help advice in there. I've read many daily meditations books, and I would rate this among the best."
4,Very beneficial resource,The lab manual reinforces material from the textbook in a variety of ways. The exercises are straightforward and not excessively redundant.
1,ABSOLUTELY do NOT get this version,"Do NOT buy from Lindsay Family Books, and do not get this version of the product. This version is from 2001. When I had problems and found out this was an antique, I tried to send it back to Lindsay, and they refused. Amazon refused on their guarantee. Thayer has recalled all these versions from THEIR sellers, but the sellers here must have gotten their product off the back of a truck or something. It is a very OLD and hard to use product. Spend a few bucks more at the Thayer site, and get a proper product. I am VERY upset at this purchase and don't know how the vendors can call a version from 2001 new!"
5,A Duet made in Heaven,"If you love George Winston's December, if you love Pat Metheny's One Quiet Night, here is the album that twice the satisfactions.Everything is so soft, so ambience, so spontaneous, so full of improvisation, no words can describe this wonderful art.You have to hear it to feel it.Try track number 1, 4, 11 all the songs have the same graceful and Zen type quality."
4,Good beginners CD,"The All-Time Greatest Hits of Roy Orbison, Volume One is Twenty-six minutes and twenty seconds long and was released on October 25, 1990. This is a good CD to listen to; I just would not consider his best. The main reason I held back the fourth star, it is missing Pretty Woman. Also the music does not sound that sharp. Overall it is a good beginner's album if you want to hear some of his tunes. The All-Time Greatest Hits of Roy Orbison, Volume One gets a B.Only The Lonely#2 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesLeah#25 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesIn Dreams#7 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#3 U.S. Billboard Middle-Road SinglesUptown#72 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesIt's Over#9 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#1 U.S. Billboard Middle-Road SinglesCrying#2 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesDream Baby#4 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesBlue Angel#9 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesWorking For the Man#33 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesCandy Man#25 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles"
2,water gets through,"repels a lot of water, but the bike certainly has some moisture on it that is more than condensation. protects decently well, but still lets some water through. So not waterproof unfortunately."
1,The anthrax letters - not worth reading,This book is really awful [...]This was the second book I had read on the anthrax letters. The first one I read was by Marilyn Thompson. Thompson's book is in a different league than the one by Lake. Thompson has real sources and you can tell that she researched the subject thoroughly. I think Lake made most of his analysis up and he seems to have a hidden agenda of some kind. His writing style is particularly awful.
1,an interminable mega-bore,"If I had to live my life all over again I'd do it all exactly the same, only I wouldn't read Edward Lake's ""Analyzing The Anthrax Attacks"".This book brings a new meaning to the word awful. Reading a book you cannot abide but have forced yourself to read because of your interest in the topic can make you feel as though you're chained to a madman or dining with a monster of solipsistic preciousness. The book has bascially two parts - one part is the ranting pretension of the author - the other is his fuming incomprehension.I forced myself to the end, hoping there would be something new concerning the anthrax case - anything. It was an exercise in futility on my part, much as it was an exercise in futility in the writing of this work of nonsense."
4,It was'nt excellent but I recommend It!,This book was'nt really that good! Personally I prefer the other Hardy Boys books( you know the ones with the blackish cover.) Anyways in this book the Hardy's friend Jamal is worried about another friend of his who's been acting weird. The brother's are suspicious and look into whats bothering this other guy. Asusual they end up uncovering a mystery and eventually solving it. Read the book to find out what happens.
4,It is amazing,I love this book it is just so interesting it makes you nervous sometimes also that is why I love it!
1,nonsense,"Weymouth doesn't sound like he even read the book. If he had, he might wonder why the author theorizes that the local gravitational field acts as a medium for light, since we've known since the last century that light travels in a vacuum. It doesn't need a medium, so Beckmann's self-published argument falls apart.Even if it did, why should we assume that it doesn't rotate, except of course out of convenience for the sake of this bizarre theory? The earth's magnetic field rotates, so its gravitational field likely does too, and recent findings by astronomers have shown strong preliminary evidence to that effect (the Gravity Proble B experiment is designed to confirm this ""frame-dragging effect"" predicted by Einstein)."
3,It's...satisfactory,"I bought Transformers Generation 2 #1 waaaay back in 1992 ('93, 94? I dunno). I still have that comic, and it's one of my favorite, all-time single-issues. Issues 2 through 6 aren't as good. The art doesn't feel as right. The writing's a bit...meh. Maybe it's just the years. I have matured a bit as a comic reader. I would suggest this book to people like me who missed it on the first go-round. But if you can find it at your local library, check it out there first before buying. It's definitely not for everyone."
5,Cat-6 for Powerline Adapters,"I bought this for use with powerline adapters to make my house wiring act as a local area network. Cat-6 is probably overkill, but who knows what the future will bring and the price was right. Works great. Took this cable and the adapters to my daughter's place to show off the adapters and it worked great there as well."
2,Too Many Errors,"I found at least one typographical, mathematical, or grammatical error in each of the three practice exams in this book. Once I discovered the editors had not proofread their own product, I lost confidence in it. I did, however, find that the book helped reacquaint me with the format of the exams."
5,One of my favourites,If you have an interest in French or Québécois pop music this is a must have.
5,a single guy's opinion,"I happened to brouse the cook book section of a local book store...en route to a boat crafts section where male craftsman hang out. I was struck by the total number of cook books and appealing front pages. I don't buy many cook books and wanted to stick to a good general book, rather than the sometimes seasonal or specialty meals.I found one that stood out and it's a winner!! Five stars for a guy that wants a meal without worrying about timing, temperatures, when to get this or that ready next--it's all thought through by the authors.I tried a ""Prosperous Pasta"" on page 85 and yes it tasted great as well as the humor of titles throughout added to a light-hearted flavor. Following the 7 steps made it easy and with wine, a close friend, this cook book made for a tasty and fun meal.Because they have about a years supply of weeknight meals--I'm looking ahead to a good year and probably some compliments from friends thanks to an accidental purchase with a fun gourmet flavor."
3,too hard to follow,"I'm in the middle on this cookbook, it's great for grouping together a complete meal for each night of the week, recipes are on one page, with preparation steps in logical sequence, grocery shopping list is already prepared and it lays flat so you can easily keep the book open while cooking; all good attributes. HOWEVER, there is no index or table of contents so you can't find a recipe easily, the recipes have stupid names that give no clue as to what you're preparing so you have to read the whole recipe to figure out if it's a soup or salad or an entree. It just depends on if you're a good enough cook to be able to read the recipe and figure out what you're cooking. I liked the cookbook but it's very confusing to follow and find an individual recipe."
1,"Clever recipe titles, but lacking in variety","Yes, the recipe titles are clever (and make it difficult to find what you're looking for), but many recipes in this book seem to be recycled versions of themselves. For instance, there are MANY (too many) desserts featuring instant pudding, crushed graham crackers/oreos/vanilla wafers, some sort of chip (chocolate, butterscotch), and Cool Whip. The authors want you to make some version of this dessert practically weekly. And don't get me started on the many rice dishes that follow the same kind of formula. A good, basic cookbook, even Betty Crocker, will serve you better than this one."
2,"Good songs, marginal quality","There are plenty of good songs, and they seem to be the originals from 1954. I particularly wanted the De Castro song which I had trouble finding elsewhere. Unfortunately, the quality leaves something to be desired. It sounds as though the songs were copied from vinyl records using heavy editing to remove the noise of scratches. Heavy editing can cause the music to have an ""underwater"" sound, kind of a warbling. I've experienced this myself when editing music from vinyl records.Also, the CD case is not the regular CD case you would expect. It is a slim cardboard case with a plastic mount for the CD inside. I hadn't seen this arrangement before.There is a series of ""Hit Parade 19XX"" CDs which may have the same characteristics."
2,Poor quality,"While the CD has a variety of titles, the sound quality is very poor. Some songs sound like they were recorded in a tin can. Others are muddy. Do not waste your money on this CD, or any of the Hit Parades."
4,The analysis of digital signal processing.,"This book takes a somewhat unorthodox approach in analyzing signals. Generally, the foundation is bolstered on the analog approach followed by the digital. This text does the antithesis, hence the name DSP First."
2,"Well, it was only a buck ninety-eight...","Well, it was only a buck ninety-eight... And, I am a fan of the bargain movie rack and of the bw western movie. Even in comparison, this one is extremely hokey. Our boys not only can't get the big picture, they can't even get the faintest glance of what's happening. And, I certainly can't say little enough about the park rangers. If there were a star in this one, I believe it was the bear."
5,No problems,"Cable arrived in just 4 days with the default shipping, came in good shape, and works fine."
2,"Great info, horribly written","White is obviously a master of the subject, but he doesn't exactly write so other people can *read* what he's saying. The format of the book -- small densely packed text -- only makes it worse. It's the sort of book that you have to read a sentence and then translate it back into english for yourself. Once you do that, you'll get a great understanding of how Torts have progressed from Holmes' day to the present."
5,Good Cable,It is what it is and does what it says. Well made and dependable. There is not much more to describe this cable -- Belkin has always been a brand I trust and they are the go to brand when I need cable. Good Price and not an over kill.
2,This is not Liszt,"I don't understand why Pletnev chose Liszt for recording. It would be better if he chose some 20th Century composer's works to play. Pletnev is so detached in his approach that you can hardly feel the drama and panache in Liszt's works. This is indeed a completely new interpretation of Liszt, but I strongly doubt if Liszt intended his music be palyed this way."
4,Requires a few extras to make it Just Right,"I did the whole ""Captain Hook"" character with this costume when my family and I went to Disneyland for Halloween. We each were a character from Peter Pan. I added a Hook, tall white socks over black long-underwear, and fashioned a big feather for the hat out of a white Boa. I also found a long, black, curly wig. I was a hit! Random people were asking to take pictures with me. The quality of this costume isn't great, but you get what you pay for. It was a good value and did the trick. And I guess I'll always have a fall-back career as a Disney character."
5,Great Product,Great product for teaching names of different animals to young kids and great to introduce imaginary play!
3,COMES OFF TO QUICKLY A LITTLE MESSY,"I am the sparkle queen, love lip gloss eye shadows etc that have just the right sparkle, when I saw this I was very excited, a little disappointed after purchase as you must put some other product on your lips first, lipstick or gloss works, though my lips look great when first applied it comes off to quickly and must be constantly applied to get that full sparkle effect. Not a total loss and I am not totally let down with my purchase."
2,Revlon Sugar Sugar,"I was so exited when I saw this on tv, but so disappointed when I rec'd it! First I didn't realize that you had to put lip gloss on first and then 'coat' your lips with this, the container stinks you actually have to pour it out on your finger and apply! Extremely messy, and for theprice I would not ever buy this again."
4,pretty good,"These dont have a ton of sparkle to them like i read on some reviews. Its light and just enough to give you a hint of shimmer. They dont stay on very long, so you have to keep reapplying. I only like the pink color, the other ones look to fake and like you have white lips. I dont think they are worth the price either."
3,Fun but could be better,"It's fairy dust in a fancy bottle. $12 or more for powder that doesn't stay on long but until it's gone it looks great. It's applied with a dipstick which is pretty weird. Overall, I won't buy it again but I'm glad I tried it. Addendum: it looks like no other lip shimmer I've seen and I did buy it again...three times!!!"
1,Terrible,"I think this was one of the most disappointing cosmetic items I've ever gotten. I loved the ad, with the frosty pink lips so I saw a bunch of these on sale and grabbed one of each colour. I opened Peri-Twinkle and was already put off by the stick applicator. I understand it's probably the only way to use it, as it is mostly just straight glitter shimmer. It's also very drying. Even if you put it on over gloss or lipstick, as soon as you put this stuff on, it sucks all the moisture out and fades away, so you'll put more on for the desired affect and you're left with super dry, ridiculous looking lips. I won't use them for eyes or face or anything, I have much better products that perform better and were advertised correctly for this purpose."
5,great value for the set,"Great value getting multiple movies in one set. Good quality movies with good pictures. Great product, good shows for family night!"
5,Muppets are Magic,These Muppet Movies just never age! They are fantastic and now my 2 boys love the Muppet Show and The Muppet Movies. Fantastic memories.
2,Muppets 3-Pack,"What is up with ""Kermit's Swamp Years""?!! Why not, ""The Muppet Movie"" or ""The Great Muppet Caper"" with the other two movies? Who cares about ""Kermit's Swamp Years""? They can only get you to buy this lousy movie by putting it in with the other two. They couldn't sell it by itself. This 3 pack should be at least $5.00 cheaper because of ""swamp years""."
3,Lacking one essential feature,"Reunion is a good product, but it is lacking one major feature -- unicode support. In this age of international and intercultural marriages, support for non-Roman scripts is essential."
2,Reunion 8.0,"I was disappointed in this product. The print-outs of family groupsheets and pedigree charts are unattractive. The cascading pedigreechart entries overlap and are unreadable. I also found the on-lineinstruction manual hard to use. If print-outs are not wanted, Reunion 8.0works reasonably well."
3,Suffers from a lack of Internet integration,"We bought an iMac with the intent of converting completely from PC to Mac. What was the one thing that made us keep the PC around? Genealogy. We had hoped that Reunion 8 would be a solution, but it's simply not up to par compared to Family Tree Maker. Yes, there are nice features, and the interface is pretty intuitive, even without a paper manual. But what Family Tree Maker does--and why we're keeping our PC as our genealogy archive--is integrate with Ancestry.com, as well as other genealogical search engines on the Net. I don't want to have to look up information in a browser, and then type it into my genealogy file. For that reason, I'm posting our ""used only once"" copy of Reunion 8 on Amazon, in case someone who's only a Mac user may be interested in it."
5,Reunion 8.0,"Reunion 8.0 is a great product. It is extremely easy to use, and very intuitive. I can figure out almost everything without even reading the help manual. I highly recommend Reunion for anyone who wants an ancestry program that is not too complicated."
5,Handy small pocket knife,I liked the clip attached to this small knife. I clip mine to a d-ring on m6y hiking backpack. It's light weight and useful for situations when you don't need a large knife. I usually have so many things in my pockets that it's nice to clip this somewhere else and have it still readily accessable.
2,The Wrong Edition,"This edition ""took such liberties with the original in the matter of ornaments"" (cf. C. Girdlestone, Jean-Philippe Rameau; his life and work, rev. & enl. ed.). If you want a reliable and scholarly edition, find the Jacobi one."
2,"Disorganized, lacks sensuality, hard for the beginner","Ms. Hudson can't resist the temptation to throw in dozens of obscure massage practices from her extensive travels. The result is needlessly complex and snobby. If you are willing to make the effort you will learn something here and there, although some of the techniques are quite difficult. I'm not convinced that even Hudson knows how to do them. To sum up, this would mainly interest a massage fanatic. It's hardly an ""ultimate"" book on the subject. In the end, I returned my copy."
5,Best fly tape ever!,"I caught 2 flies as I was hanging the tape up! I only noticed maybe 4 flies flying around my kitchen, but the next day I had a good 30 on the tape! A couple more show up on the tape everyday, but I haven't seen a live fly since the day I put it up! Something about it just attracts them instantly. They work great indoors and out."
4,fly catching,The strips work well I hate seeing flys on it so I am fast to change it ugh so I just put the whole thing in a bag while its hanging and then unhook it.
5,Get rid of them flies!!!!,"This works, becareful putting this up. Very sticky. Don't pull the strip out to fast... take your time. The strip will come out of the little round barrel shape holder."
1,Lousy,I put this in my kitchen. No flies whatsoever were attracted to it. This was a waste of money. I won't buy it again.
2,only watched it for one reason.,I only got this movie for one reason. Four of my friends were in the film. there's was the only fun part of the film. The rest of it drug out and bored me to tears.
2,Not the worst movie ever made.....,It is true! This dvd does not contain the worst movie ever made. It's a double feature: Hillbilly Monster and Grandparents from Outer Space. That means IT'S THE WORST TWO MOVIES EVER MADE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5,WHAT A SEQUEL !,DID YOU FIND YOURSELF ASTOUNDED BY THE FIRST TWO JAN GEL MOVIES (AVAILABLE ON ONE DVD HERE AT AMAZON)? THEN YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS ONE!
5,Star Wars AT-AT,Star Wars AT-AT one of the classic icons from Star Wars. This toy is a later version of the original but still just as good maybe even better. The AT-AT comes with two figures which is nice. Overall it was a great expieience.
5,Same thing!?!?!?!?!?,"This is made from the old mold... except it has a few caca smears, and therefore you should buy it!!!! Fantastic value! Buy six while you're at it. 1 for now, 1 for later, and 4 for ebay cause they're flying off the shelves. Forget the fact that there's a new one, which is nicer, cheaper, and newly designed... buy the old sucky one. You'll thank me later."
2,Cheap scale,This is a cheap scale that arrived scratched and bent. Damaged to the point where it woult not operate properly. I returned it and bought a USPS digital 10 lb. scale which I am very happy with even though I spent about $12 more. it's worth it.
4,"Creative, Heart-warming,","I picked up this movie not knowing what to expect. It turned out to be one of the most creative movies I have seen in recent times. It takes slapstick comedy (if you can call it that - I call it art!) to a whole new level. True - it is at-times surreal but the two actors (and the director) handle emotions so well, that even without much dialogue they succeed in keeping you hooked for the entire movie. The director does a fine job weaving the tale around situations that take some real absurd turns (for eg: the flaming fake leg scene). And yet... in the end it does not feel over-done. What keeps you going is not only the quirk characters but also the fine creative way of story-telling, in my opinion.In terms of creativity, this movie was definitely off-the-charts and for that alone, this deserves at least 4 stars and gets a must-see recommendation from me. (Must add: Definitely not a movie for people that are used to standard fare that Hollywood churns out though.)"
4,Sweet physical comedy that recalls silent films and early talkies,"Like their earlier, even better 'L'Iceberg', this is an inventive throwback to silent films and physical comedies, directed, written and chieflyperformed by a talented trio of circus trained clowns.It's complete with their trademark minimal dialogue and dark events that never keep the film from being light and funny. For example, near the start of the film, the two main characters are in a car crash; one loses a leg, the other his memory, but somehow it works being played for laughs.As a whole, this didn't work quite as well as their 'L'Iceberg' for me - that had a more interesting, surreal plot to hang their routines on, andmore of their bits rose to the level of truly inspired, but this is still a sweet, funny, good-hearted film that cheerfully refuses to play by modern rules."
1,Disappointed,"DisappointedI bought the DVD Rumba because I enjoyed enormously the gags shown in an advertising short cut movie presentation. Taken independently the jokes are very good:* A lesson of English to French speaking kids* The end of the school* A man trying to commit suicide by being hit by a vehicle* Abel and Gordon entirely destroyed home by a fire leaving them without shelter under heavy rain* Flowers sent to the sea and immediatly coming back by Gordon to commemorate Abel drowning.The movie was becoming more and more boring: the mere addition of all theses gags does not make a 77 minutes movie.The couple, Gordon and Abel, certainly enjoy their job but in anyway they cannot be compared to Jacques Tati, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Marx Brothers."
1,Very disappointing,"Drawn entirely from secondary sources, there is nothing new to be found in this biography. I wouldn't even recommend it to someone who has read no other biography of Ball, as it is filled with the most elementary mistakes. The author doesn't even describe the ""Lucy"" episode with William Holden accurately. Just skip this one."
2,If you can't even describe the Bill Holden episode...,"correctly, you have no business being a Ball biographer. (Lucy had an 'argument' with Holden at the Brown Derby? As Ricky would say ""Whaaaa????"")A tepid rehashing of every Lucille Ball book ever written. We know every story by now, and his one original thesis )that she was more successful on television than in the movies) is never really argued or clarified.Rent it at the library if you must but I would save my dough."
4,Good and straightforward,"This was the first and so far only biography I read of Lucille Ball; I found it to be good. It covers her life from childhood to death and discusses everything that seems important: her years starting out in modeling and show business in New York, moving to Los Angeles, meeting Desi, starting the show that became so famous, Desilu studios, the breakup with Desi, her later years. I would've liked to read more about her kids and her relationship with them, but it's her biography, not theirs, and maybe that kind of information isn't forthcoming to a biographer. I would've liked more photos, too. But I shut the book feeling that I've gotten a good solid basis for my Lucille Ball education. This seems like a good book from which to go on to others."
3,Ball of fire is right,"Overall I thought the book was very good. I really didn't ""know"" who Lucy was and I feel I know the person now. What was very interesting to me was the fact that Lucy was a control freak who people hated to work with. She would also have temper tantrums like a little girl and would later apologize.The sections (and there are a lot of them) on Desi were very good. I never knew how smart he was. The talent he had for choosing the right actors and projects. Not just for the Lucy show itself but for their production company. You will be surprised at some of the popular titles that we still hear about today.Lastly the one glaring omission is Buster Keaton. In the book it states that Buster was a mentor to Lucy. She listened to him when everyone else thought he was washed up. He helped her with her comic timing. The book, just gave a few sentences to this, which I thought was very disappointing and because of this omission I cannot give it 5 stars."
5,Great Book,"I really enjoyed this book, it was very interesting and a good read.I read it on kindle and was well edited."
5,Good Set for New as Well as Experienced Calligraphers,"While I am not a beginner at calligraphy, I bought the large set with three pens, three nibs, and cartridges in assorted colors simply because it was such a good value. On the plus side, these are standard Sheaffer fountain pens that take standard ""classic"" Sheaffer fountain pen cartridges and other standard Sheaffer nibs. The jewel-toned plastic pen barrels are lightweight, attractive, and easy to hold. Two quality control issues: the fine-point nib in my set has very poor ink flow, although the other two work beautifully.(Poor ink flow can be discouraging, especially to the beginner.)Oddly, in this set the color of the cartridge did not necessarily coincide with the color of the ink inside--for example, both the purple and the dark blue cartridges contained black ink. On the whole, the large set is an excellent value and a great way to get started in calligraphy."
4,The Calligraphy kit,"This calligraphy kit is very nice, and works very well on invitations and other fancy things.However, some of the colors are a little light, and so you cannot see it on the paper. Overall, this calligraphy kit is great for many uses and deserves four stars."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the quality of the pens and ink. The ink runs and the enclosed material was not that good. I also purchased The Complete Caligraphy Set (Readers Digest - Ann Bowen) and all though it uses dip pens, it turns out that they work MUCH better and the material was excellent. For the price, I cannot knock this kit too much, but truthfully, I probably will never use this set. The ink is runny, the nibs are too hard and I just could not control the ink flow. Stick with dip pens and some good bottle ink."
4,Good product.,"Comes just as advertised. 3 pens with multiple colored ink cartridges which you build yourself. I have no previous experience with calligraphy so I can't say whether or not this is a great product in that regards. The included book has a few fonts illustrating pen-stroke for the entire alphabet. Good to get things started. As with all things, practice makes perfect. Don't expect to learn the art without applying some time and practice."
2,Not worth the money,"The pens do not work well at all. These are not good calligraphy pens, and if I hadn't thrown out the packaging, I would have returned it."
4,good value for the price,"This product seems comparable in construction, design, and quality to a Gator guitar case I also own. It is lightweight, apparently durable, reasonably well constructed, and pretty cost effective. Made in China.The foam cutouts are just right for holding Shure SM58 microphones. I also have a somewhat larger AKG vocal mic that will require modification of the foam to make it fit. I sure wouldn't fill this with expensive microphones and check it at the airport without putting it inside some additional packing, but it's quite adequate to throw into a big gear box with a bunch of other band stuff.The handle feels nice in my hand."
1,"bad book, period","Nowadays you can seldom find a book from which you learn absolute nothing. But this is the one. The book makes a big claim. But the author is dancing around in providing details and hard data. Whenever he makes a critical argument,the evidence is gone and footnote is gone. It looks like that he made up the story. I even don't want to resell it because I believe that nobody should read this kind of garbage."
1,An ad for BabyPlus. Just awful.,What a disappointment this book was: a compilation of technical information and a shameless plug for Baby Plus about which there is no compelling evidence to its efficacy or safety. A waste of money.
2,Tedious,"I appreciate the concepts advanced in this text, but it is poorly written. The entire book could be condensed into an article. Author goes off on tangents and writes with too many modifiers, which makes for a rambling incoherent text."
1,Difficult Book to Read,"I'm a very competent reader, but this book was just technical gobbily-gook. It is almost impossible to read unless you have a PhD in Psychology and English. I could barely make sense of it.I recommend the baby plus system, but this book is not for the average reader."
2,Not an easy read,"This book was personally not my style. I expected an easy read to learn more about the subject. However, the book was very clinical. It is more for people in the medical and psychology field than an everyday reader. To me it wasn't fun and I ended up putting it away before I finished it... the only thing I got out of it was about the ""baby plus"", which I ended up buying."
1,not for me,"I checked the product mentioned in this book. It is a kind of special earphone with a belt around mom's belly,produce a recorded sound like bum-bum-bum-bum. I don't think this is not my baby needed: I'd rather give it real music.Overall, I agree the title but do not like the way the book is written and what it leads you to."
3,Not a rating--further information on this title and author.,"Both Hewlett and Holl served as Chief Historian at the Department of Energy and had access to highly classified records at the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Security Council, the Department of State and the FBI.The first two volumes of this history of the Atomic Energy Commission, by Hewlett with other co-authors, covered the years from 1939 through 1952. They were first published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 1962. Both those original volumes were later reprinted by the University of California Press in the early 1990s as part of the 'California Studies in the History of Science' series."
1,It is NOT the cable pictured... BEWARE... .,"I searched for a Belkin high quality cable because i wanted something high quality for Audio recording ( Using it with my Tube mic preamp that has a USB interface )Cable arrives in a plastic bag, a cheap and thin USB cable.. unknown brand.. I have several belkin cables and belkin cables are much thicker, better quality and have are labeled BELKIN somewhere on the cable so you know what your buying..BUYERS BEWARE this is NOT a Belkin cable!! I guess the seller figured who would really know? and just shoved some unknown cable in the bag."
5,Performs as advertised,I bought this for my PS3 to charge the controller. The cable is well-made and the insulation is adequately thick.
1,Not Belkin!,MarginMart sent a black generic cable - not the Belkin item they pictured - I think they just expect people to roll over because of the price. You can find the real thing for a buck and a half more elsewhere.
4,This works with the Sony PSP,This cable as an A connector on one end and a mini-B connector on the other. It works with the Sony PSP. It feels a bit cheap but the price can't be beat.
5,Awesome,"This cable is solid. I have been using this cable for several devices like my digital camera, mp3 player and my motorola razr."
5,Long USB Cable,at 10 feet this is nice long cable. I use mine to control my camera. The extra couple feet is nice to have when connecting a laptop to a camera for studio work or self portraits.
5,Well Made Cable,"This is a well made cable, nice thick jacket, and good connectors. I have never had a problem with the connection of this cable. I am pretty rough on my cables, but after months it is still working fine w/ no problems. 10 feet, well built cable, at this price...I would buy another without a doubt."
4,Sorta Works,It works well for USB data but has a problem charging my GoPro. I think the length may be causing a little voltage drop... no clue.
1,This is a CHILD's bracelet!!!!,"I was very unhasppy to see that when this item arrived...it was for a child NOT an adult. The title should really reflect that! Plus the color sent was not the color shown...it shows blue, I got pink. now I am stuck with a bracelet I could not give as a gift and had to rush out at the last minute a few days before Christmas to find something else. Needless to say, I will not be buying again from this seller. It's not even worth it to return it...the shipping ($8) cost almost as much as the bracelet did plus I'd have to pay returnh shipping as well. Highly disappointed!!!!"
5,My kid enjoyed,"I read this book to my daughter and she seemd to enjoy. The book is similar to a Nancy Drew type mystery, and while as an adult I found it kind of simple, it presented an interesting main character who took action to solve a problem in her neighborhood. My daughter is now re-reading the book on her own, which is agreat accomplishment for her.I would recommend this book to any elementary aged reader."
4,Great mat,Makes cutting slick with a cutting wheel or knife.My wife uses this all the time for her sewing and crafts.
4,"Works Well, Just a little off","Works great as a self healing mat. However, the numbering does not run 1-12 inches (bought thte 12x18 board) instead it only goes to 11 and 17. Throws me a little off when trying to measure and cut at the same time. My other board numbers 1-12 amd 18. So that's what I'm used to using. Only bought a new board because my old one has started to warp.Would have sent it back, but I didn't notice until I was already using my rotary knife on it. Oh well, it gets the job done. Guess I'll get used to it."
3,Really hard,"My only experience with self-healing mats are those made specifically for fabric, so maybe this doesn't apply if you're buying it for another purpose. This mat is nicely made and has clear markings. The problem is it is really hard and so doesn't really ""heal"". I've used it to cut about fifty quilt squares and it now has a mark where I was cutting. Because of this, I'm also a little concerned about how quickly it will dull my rotary cutter."
5,Alvin 42x30 cutting mat,"While the mat was curled from shipping, I left it lay flat and weighted down on the porch picnic table for several days in the hot weather. It flattened out nicely and the ordor was not bad when I brought it in the house. The mat fits perfectly on my cutting table and so far I am very pleased with it.One caveat, you will have to direct sign when it is delivered or go to the FedEX station to pick it up. This can be very inconvenient if you live far from one, as I do."
2,Heat Destroys this product otherwise GREAT tool,"I received 2 mats, the 18x24 and the 24x36. These are great surfaces to work on and have great visual aids for cutting stuff on. I took the big one to the art show to mat some prints. The work table wasn't really in direct sunlight4 weeks ago and the high was 83. So I noticed the matte curling up like a clam shell. The thing won't lie flat and is ruined. So I took the smaller one to our beach house last week. it was transported in a tub with the other kits. when I got there this too was curled up even worse than the later one. I do not remember seeing warning labels about heat. Now these 2 precision tools are nearly useless. They were really pretty expensive."
5,Great price!,This thing is perfect size for most desks. and at 8 bucks you can't go wrong! The fact that it it's double sided is also a magnificent feature! I love this thing.
5,Alvin professional cutting mat,"Excellent product, good value for the money paid. Saved a good few dollars when compared to buying the same from a store. No regrets."
5,Great mat,I really enjoy this mat . It is just as good as the one I got a from name brand supplier. I think it's a little large for my use but at least this way I can flip it over and rotate it several times to make it last a great while. I would recommend this product.
5,good deal,"I have cut with razor knives repeatable on it with no problems, it lays flat and the guide lines are very useful. very much worth the price."
3,Cutting size ver board size,"Somehow I missed that the cutting size is not a full yard, 36 inches, this is the size of the entire mat, from edge to edge. Still, this is bigger then any previous cutting surface I have and I can likely pair it with my smaller mat to extend my cutting surface. The item is still in the package so I don't know how well otherwise it will function. The grid looks decent and having more drawn angles should help.So, if you need a ruled edge on a mat, this goes to 35X 23 and the rest is boarder with your incremental lines."
1,"BEWARE OF CHEMICALS KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER, BIRTH DEFECTS, AND OTHER REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES.","State of CA bans it, nor was the information disclosed in the details. The warning label was affixed on the product and I was too scared to open it. If this matters to you, don't get it. I don't think it's worth it."
5,Superior Quality,Bought one of these for my wife and she loves it. The quality is superb. We took a long at others in Walmart and a Fabric store. In additon to being more expensive the Alvin feels so much more well made.
5,Another Satisfied Customer,I received this item quickly and it's just what I expected. The price was very reasonable. Very happy with this product.
5,impressed,"First of all, I'm a complete beginner in sewing/quilting. I bought this to start a new hobby. The main reason I am giving it a 5 star is the value. I visited Michael's and a local sewing shop store and they sold this exact same mat (same brand/same size) for 2x the price!!! So glad I bought it from Amazon. It came in 2 days as always and I have only tried using it a few times, but it seems to work like described so I have had no qualms. As I have said, I am a beginner so take that into consideration."
2,Not what I expected,"The mat is a quality mat, but it is only gridded up to 35"" and am returning it as I need the full 36"" of grids. So I will purchase an Olfa mat that is actually 37"" with 1/2 ease on each side. Good mat if the extra inch doesn't matter to you."
1,P.O. S.,"I am so disappointed in this product. After having it for only a few weeks, the damn thing is warped, rendering it more or less useless. I can cut some things, but the whole point is for this to be a flat, even surface. I bought this for cutting, but also to cover up the rough surface of my desk, and now it is a whole new problem. Also, the mat is already becoming mangles after repeated cuts in the same area. For the price, go get a better product. This thing sucks and as a poor artist, I am disheartened and really could have used that money on something better. Id love a refund...."
5,"Great quality, perfect size","The quality of this mat is top notch. I use it with my rotary cutter and have not had any marks on the mat yet. The mat is fairly heavy so it doesn't move around on the table, which is a good thing. Has a lot of measurement marks for quilting and lining up straight cuts. I find it to be the perfect size, not too big and not too small. It takes up about half of my 6 seat dining room table. I found the price to be good, too, in comparison to buying a mat from a brick and mortar store. I would buy one of these again if I needed to, and I recommend it to others."
1,bad description of item,"These mats are supposed to be 48 X 36 but are in fact 35 3/4 X 47 1/2. For many, this may not be an issue; but this is not acceptable for my application. I called Alvin directly and was told that they import the mats from the manufacturer in Asia with their name stamped on them. They have no control over the manufacturing process at all and relayed to me that the size variation is up to 1/2 inch. I am returning these 2 mats (which seem to be impossible to get in the actual advertised size) and purchasing 4 mats of size 36 x 24 from a retailer that ships directly from the Alvin Company, whose customer service supervisor confirmed for me that the mats in my order would be within 1/16 of the measurements stated. Overall a big hassle. It should be clearly stated in the product description that actual sizes may vary up to 1/2 inch."
1,Damaged,"Received this product with the corner broken off and the mat cracked. It isn't worth the money to send it back - so this was garbage. The corner wasn't even in the box, thus my assumption is it was packaged this way. I'm very disappointed with this product and am now out the money."
1,worked until a little heat warps the product and is ruined,I have 3 ALVIN mats and these are expensive. They were subjected to a little heat. Not a lot of heat and they warped and are now useless for what they are used for. The image at the right showing the green on one side and the black on the other is now what this thing looks like. I would avoid this product considering the investment. I called ALVIN customer service and they do not stand by this product except to say it was a limited 90 day warranty. WHo knows what kind of heat will ruin this mat. What if you spill hot coffee on it. BAD PRODUCT.
1,Incorrect Sizing,"I bought this mat expecting the measurements to go up to 12 and 18, but nope they only go up to 11 and 17. they include the borders as part of the measurements. I returned this item before opening and ordered a different brand."
5,Best of Flat & Scruggs,"If you are already a fan of Bluegrass, you probably don't need this review as you know these guys are amazing and you have most of these recordings somewhere else. If you are just getting started appreciating the music, this is a great cd to get. It has a good range of music and *all* pieces are absolutely stellar!I got this for my kids as I know the material is good and they just love the positive energy of the music. ""Flat & Scruggs"", ""Bill Monroe"", ""Old and In The Way"", and Springsteen's ""Seeger Sessions"" are all big favorites in my house."
3,"Good buy, with exceptions","There was absolutely nothing wrong with the disc. No scratches, no skips. Looked at first in off the shelf condition. The disc cover fell apart as soon as I opened it, though, and the disc was placed in the cover upside down!Am pleased with the quality of the music, but had to find a new cover to store it in."
5,Roentgen is spinning in his grave,"I'm not against science, butWhile a very informative book for children, it really downplays the social and moral implications of radiology. Don't I really have to bring up the fluoroscopes that caused cancer and osteoporosis. If radiologists really don't have anything to hide and this is perfectly safe then why did she put on a lead vest and walk down the hall, huh?Roentgen underwent a deathbed conversion after all.I mean face it; X-rays are dangerous radiation which is why I only heat things in my daughter's easy bake oven(not in a microwave). Nothing quite beats the taste of a bagel roasted over a warm lightbulb. I'd rather be safe than sorry.Though in full disclosure I should say that I collect victorian era erotica so I might be slightly biased here. Just letting you know"
5,Neat Little Series,There are a lot of these little books and they all are very well done. Our kids love the idea of getting to know about SCIENCE. The 7th grade teachers I work with even use it with their kids in Science class. TryFrom Tadpole to Frog (Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science 1).As I am adding product links I see that Amazon has over 600 titles in this series listed
4,Found it interesting... By why just for African Americans?,"I find myself reading this book when I go to Barnes and Noble. I'm frustrated that she even put African American in the title because what she writes is applicable to everyone under that sign. I read it before I read the title...and then when I saw the title, it almost shocked me. If a white person put European American on the front, people would say it was being discriminatory. This book isn't JUST for blacks, but for anyone who is under that sign. It's a well-written, insightful book that describes the person under that sign regardless of their color. ....But, honestly, I haven't bought the book yet...love it, but haven't bought it because the title isn't inclusive."
1,amateurish at best,"This book was very amateurish. I was expecting a bit more detail and indepth information about astrology instead of examples. I wanted to learn more about astrology and the signs but this did little to address the topic moreso, the personality types of each sign. I bought Black Love Signs by this same author and it was basically a copy cat of Black Sun Signs and did not offer any additional information. I wonder if you can plagiarize your own book?"
3,If you're into Astrology,"You'll like this book. A friend had one of her other books, and I liked it. I thought this would be an easy and entertaining book to read while at work. It served it's purpose!"
2,It proves that Jaki Lieberzeit could only be a drummer,"THIS solo effort of Can's drummer surely try to capture the experimental sound of Can, but unfortunately , besides try to be more polished, they can't really achieved their goal. Jaki is the brain of his group ""phantom band"", it's without guitar or other melodic instruments, so the overall sound is just with syn-drums and bass and occasionally keyboard effects. THe open track ""Loading zone"" is better, but after that all the tracks are based on the same formula. Quite boring indeed. Can's fans should try other better solo effort like Irmin Schmidt's ""mUst at dusk""."
4,Excellent introduction to brick masonry,"This is a valuable guide for novice brick masons. The author is an expert who takes you through the basics of materials, tools, layout, and a good selection of projects for around the house. This is a fairly unique book and fills a void in the how to do section."
4,Interesting tips,This book is straight forward and you will learn tips from the pros. I had very little experience when reading this book; afterwards I knew tricks that my friend the brick layer did not know. I then went on to doing my own brick work around the home.
4,Great book for uninitiated mason,I purchased this book because I needed to tuckpoint and repair one off my walls. This book is a great resource for those who are handy but have never tried their hand at brick laying. I feel that I can now do all my own patching and I am even thinking that I might try to do the brick work when we redo our entry way.
2,Beautiful music but very poor recording,"The music is a gift, beautiful songs of the 1950's but the recording is very poor, too much back noise and incomplete phrases, ""jumping"" all the time. It's a pity."
3,"Wonderfully nostalgic, bargain-priced, but sibilant","Hit Parade 1955This CD contains a wonderfully nostalgic collection of 25 songs that I remember from my early childhood. Several of the songs stimulated strong memories of my parents. My only disappointment is in the audio quality. Several of the songs are noticeably sibilant, marked by ""splattering"" of ""s"" sounds. The price is a bargain, however, and I'm happy I bought this CD."
2,Poor quality,"There are a variety of titles on this CD, but the sound quality is VERY poor. Some tracks are tinny, some are muddy. Do not waste your money on this or other Hit Parade CD's."
1,No Support for Education Version,"I guess if you can get Painter X to work when installed it is a good product. If you can't (Vista, 8 Gig memory, 2T disk, Cintiq21), you have to pay for support by the call (for education version which is same base program w/o some of the bells and whistles). I kept trying and got it installed and working but pallettes would not move out of center of screen or dock anywhere but the center. Any attempt to change brush size/characteristics abended program. I am glad I was EDUCATED about Corel before buying the full price version."
4,Suits the Needs of What I Was Looking For,"Is this the do all/be all solution in it's field? Probably not. I reviewed several to purchase for a relative who studied CAD drawing. But his interests lie in art, designs, and tattoos to name a few. After careful review, I felt this would be the best to get him FOR A START until he decided, after more use, the features which would be more important to him. I gave the program to him for Christmas, and as it turns out, he was very pleased, because he happened to be using the trial version and I did not even know about it. He hasn't complained about the program yet."
4,Corel Painter X,I wanted Corel X but did not need the book so this purchase was perfect for me. I could not pass up this deal. Great Product and Great price. Works great with my Wacom tablet.
4,"Not satisfactory , not at all","Software its nice, the only bad thing the serial number didnt worked, but the team in corel helped me with my problem and updated to corel painter 11.Painter X is one of the best old school painters, even with their little bugs and some errors i wont trade this software for nothing."
5,WOW!!,This product is the best graphic program ever. It works great in my operating system VISTA. The only limitations of Corel Painter X is the artists creativity.
1,Not happy.,"Again not too excited, when opened, none of the supplies were included, and it was not described as 'used'. Will be more careful!"
4,Great Book For Begining Quillers!,I loved buying this book. I learned all the quilling techniques. I suggest this book to anyone who wants to learn to quill!
2,not what I expected,Although this book did contain directions on how to create several quilled items I think it's more appropriate for children. I was a little disappointed with the purchase
4,Nice activity to keep Me busy,"So the glue I got was old and wouldn't come out of the bottle. [so I've been using other glue] Alot of the pictures and directions give at least me ideas on other things I could make. It's very fun, I wouldn't try doing it in a car. I did really wish that it came with alot more paper. [I found I went through the blue really fast...maybe only got to do two creatures and it was gone] So I'll have to be ordering some more paper. If you have a paper shredder that just shreds into stripes then all you need is some colored paper and you'd probably be good to go. [it does say that the paper it comes with is the perfect thickness, right weight etc to make it work. so maybe my idea wouldn't work] It's been very fun and I've been mailing out alot of cards to everyone. :)"
5,Great scrapbook ideas,"I LOVED this book. The instructions are simple and the projects are adorable. I will definately use them in my scrapbook. The projects are appropriate for boys, girls, children and adults. Best of all, the book comes with everything that you need to complete the projects (even little wiggle eyes). This book is worth twice the cost!!!"
3,Twirled Paper..,I was a little disappointed with this product..I thought it was suppose to be 'new' and contain the twirling tool...but it did not>
2,great eye candy - little else,"Lots of really cute pictures - but I bought it to make certain items that I saw on the cover and in the book. Well - much to my surprise, the instructions(lengths of paper, etc) for all of the items I wanted to make were not included. What a major disappointment. I am an experienced quiller, so I can probably figure it all out, but it would have been so nice to have instructions for all of the pictures. Not so few. To say I'm sorry I purchased this book would be an understatement."
1,Does not fulfill my intended purpose: Showering,"I bought this to use while camping as a shower. The structure is too flimsy to hold any size water bag. It happened to be windy the day I used it, and the poles snapped. It would be OK for privacy if you needed to change, but that's about it. Not recommended."
2,privacy shelter,"It's tall enough. It's roomy enough, but it's a pain in the **** to put together and it takes both of us to do it."
1,unhappy,I was not happy with this at all it did not hold the 5 gallon bag and it broke with first use
1,Snapped and broke the first time I used it!,It got good reviews from others but mine snapped and broke when it was just sitting there. You do see shadows through it depending upon where it is in the sun.
5,pota privy,"We just used it this past weekend on a camping trip. We used it as a shelter for a port a potty.It was great. We had four young girls with us. Sets up in seconds. The only negative is trying to get in back in its bag that it comes with, But other then that it worked great I would definitely recommend to a friend."
1,A GOOD PRESENT FOR YOUR ENEMY,This tent is the worst piece of garbage you can buy. Made out of a tissue paper like fabric. You need 8 arms to put it together. Don't buy it unless you are giving it to someone you don't like.
3,Cabana Shelter,"I have used this shower twice. The major problem with it is it is not sturdy enough to hold your standard camping shower. It has already collapsed on a family member showering. I wish it had a another pocket as well to hold more items. But, it will do out in the middle of the woods"
1,Falls Apart,"Most tents, after they are assembled can be moved around like an empty box, the Stansport Cabana Privacy Shelter falls apart. You must spend an additional 20 minutes securing each joint with twine or it will just come apart when touched. Save your money. Buy a regular dome tent for changing instead."
2,Stansport Privacy Shelter,"For the people reviewing this as a shower, it is not meant to be one. No where in the description of the product or on the box does it mention it's designed to be a shower. That's about all I can say to defend the Stansport Cabana. It's poorly made and difficult to put up for one person. The door is hard to zip close at the top because of the tension on the poles. The poles feel like they are going to break when assembling it. There are two windows at about waist level on the sides for limited ventilation and none at the top. And if you close the two windows for privacy, you'll have no ventilation. The shelter doesn't have a floor in it. That may be a plus or minus for you depending on how you are using it. We sent it back."
3,GAH,Ok... Do I love that it's a privacy tent for my porta potty? YES! Is it a beeatch to put together.. YES. OH.MY.GAH. The poles in my opion are really hard to work with. I've set it up now 4 times and the last time I set it up one of the poles split. I'll be looking for one that is easier to set up for the 2013 season.
3,"good, but hard to set up",We bought this for our week long camping trip and it was nice to have. It is difficult to set up because of the top poles and we ended up ripping it when we took it down the last time.
3,Sturdy,"Little time consuming first time setup. But gets easier each time. Once setup though, it is very sturdy. A little transparent (silhouette only) if any back lighting, due to thickness of fabric. Recommend using under shade or up against some backdrop for best privacy.Overall, not a bad value for price."
4,NICE,Works well for our portable toilet. The zipper does come apart if zipped up too quick however. Stays put in windy conditions with the use of larger stakes then came with the item.
3,"Good price, OK product","Used it last weekend to cover a portapotty. Did not stay up in the wind gusts we had by the Cape Cod Canal. The tent pins that come with it are useless. Just little pieces of bent wire. The shelter, itself is OK. Takes a little muscle to get the support rods to snap into place, but not too bad. Good size. Nice big footprint and plenty tall enough for my 6'2"". The tent survived the blow, just would not hold in place. Next time out, I'll try better tent stakes and figure a way to snap it to the camper. Since I'm using it to hide a portapotty, I think you can understand why I'm not doing a video review ;)"
3,Quick...VERY QUICK...Delivery,"Considering it still being winter, there has not been any use of this product. The excitement that came from the recievers of the gift was excited to use it. I was told I would not get it by Christmas, but Christmas eve, there it was on the front step. It came 5 days quicker than originally scheduled."
3,Not it supports a shower of 5 gallons,For the price it is however an interesting purchase he/she should have very undoubtedly alone he/she will offer him/her privacy. Not seek to hang a portable shower of the superior part since the result it will be that the sticks bent immediately. He/she should make it with a rope and from a tree. additionally he/she doesn't have a hole reason why in the superior part if he/she wants to use it to take a bath he/she will make the hole with a knife.
2,Their is better out there.,My tents not this hard to put. Way to difficult to put up and once you to do its not very stable. Wouldn't recommend at all. Spend a little more and get a better one.
2,The Rubic's cube of shelters,"I camped at seven different sites over a course of a week, as I was making my way along the coast. This required taking this structure down and reassembling it on as many occassions. If you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles, and pins while camping, then this is the item for you...and I am patient,handy and not a stranger to assembling things. I don't know why manufacturers sometimes take a potentially simple design and complicate it. The number of poles is way too many for this structure, and their configurations are way too complex. The instructions are made only to confuse things more. It could be made so much more user friendly.Once it's up, it gets a thumbs up."
3,Good to have.,When we got this product I tried to put it together by myself and I couldn't do it alone. The portable shower was too heavy and it kept falling over. But it was good coverage for the port-o-pottie. It was good to have but it needed to be a little stronger to hold the shower.
2,Lots of problems,"I cannot recommend this product. One of the tent rods was the wrong size and even after modifying it I found it really impossible for one person to set it up. I did like the price and I think there is a market for a low price no frills Cabana like this, but I ended up paying for another brand at a much higher price that is much better designed."
3,Nice little hideaway,"This was the first shower room I purchased and I did like it. My only BIG complaint is how hard it is to set up. It probably takes a good 20-30 minutes to get the thing assembled. I've misplaced a few of my connectors, so it's important to hang on to the instructions. A simple floor would be nice, so you don't have to stand in the mud. It won't hold a full shower bag, so be frugal about the water you use inside, unless you want to fill it up halfway thru your shower! I like the windows, although it gets pretty hot inside."
4,Works well,"We use this as a porta potty shack while camping. We have yet to have it set up in bad weather or high winds, although I don't think there will be much of a problem with either situation. We plan to use it eventually with a shower, however, there is no premade hole for an outside shower unless you go underneath the tent (it does not have a floor).We have used it twice thus far and have enjoyed and appreciate having it instead of hiking to the campground restrooms."
4,Solid but weak Zippers,"Set this up in a windy area near water.Works well.PROSEasy to set upFollow directions, the vertical poles seem best put on with the tent 'skirted' up high to allow for easier fitSturdy - even in windy conditions, holds up wellRoomySimpleNOTEThis is primarily good for changing and pottieFor shower use there are two issues:1. No hole in top to lead in water source or hose, only works with bag showers2. As others point out, hook too flimsy to hold serious shower bagNeeds a hole and a support hook tied to the frame (poles), NOT to the inner tent material as is nowCONSDoor Zipper broke after 5 days of useZipper itself started to get off track as it was getting hard to zip with just one internal zipper leverConnections for base poles (bottom) a bit strange, can come apartBest to tie them together and then stake into ground, or the rings shift and can open up leaving base at riskI have asked for a replacement and will try again."
3,Not sturdy but will work,"It is not easy to get set up, I fought with it getting the poles in butonce that's accomplished it appears that it will work fine. The materialsdon't appear to top quality or I would have given it another star. It shouldsuffice for a few camping trips."
5,'Amazing' 'Kieth Bust,"Personally, I believe this is actually THEE very 1st Spiderman Bust of this production of 5000 pieces. If you enjoy Sam Kieth' work at all, I am sure this would be a prized possession in any collection."
2,Didn't do it for me.,"This didn't work on me, but I haven't found anything that does except for lipo injections. It could just be my system."
4,Wimpy? Think again.,"Freddy Fender is a Texas legend. The previous poster made reference to FF having ""melodic grace"" after the wimpy remark. I will agree with the former and not the latter. Along those lines, I will concede that he paved the way for the Mavericks and Rick**not Justin**Trevino. RT has even did a fine cover of ""Wasted Days and Wasted Nights."""
2,Amazon MP3?,I wonder why Amazon thinks I need their MP3 player to use an MP3 file....It is a common format...I don't like being forced to download a special application just to pay Amazon for a plain-vanilla MP3 file.....There are many sources for this standard format music.
4,Tex-Mex country pop,"Riding the wave of countrypolitan pop during the early 1970s, Tex-Mex border balladeer Freddy Fender had a huge hit in 1975 with his bilingual version of ""Before The Next Teardrop Falls,"" following it up with one of his most vigorous outings, ""Wasted Days And Wasted Nights,"" which was also a huge Top Ten hit. Although he had a long history as a regional artist, Fender's singing style was pretty sissified, which fit perfectly into the softcore pop template of early '70s Nashville, although hard country fans may find it a little irritating. This too-brief best-of has several of his biggest hits, including fine examples of his Spanish-language material. He may have been kinda wimpy, but Fender had melodic grace, and is also a key figure in the history of latino roots music, paving the way for Los Lobos, Justin Trevino and the Mavericks."
4,"GET IT, it's worth the search","Excellent book with a clever plot and some clever word work by the author. The ending was not quite as strong as it might have been, but otherwise this was well worth reading"
3,"Wonderfully nostalgic, bargain-priced, but sibilant","Hit Parade 1953This CD contains a wonderfully nostalgic collection of 25 songs that I remember from my early childhood. Several of the songs stimulated strong memories of my parents. My only disappointment is in the audio quality. Several of the songs are noticeably sibilant, marked by ""splattering"" of ""s"" sounds. The price is a bargain, however, and I'm happy I bought this CD."
5,amazing hardcore album...,"this is seriously one of my favorite hardcore albums. its full of power and emotion but remains well thought out musically is amazing too, with serious attention paid to slow and fast differences. they are amazing at retards into breaksdowns..."
2,Disappointing,"The cover of this album describes it as 'Leave-taking from the British Folk revival 1970-1977' and that was indeed a period worth commemorating. This collection, sadly, does not do it justice. There are only 13 tracks (and only 9 artists, as 4 of them appear twice) and what there is in no way represents the best of the period.The Watersons were a great group, but Lal Waterson, singing solo on two of these tracks, is painfully out of tune. The other performers on this album are fine, and are well worth a listen, but you will find them all better represented on other albums.I realize that this selection is restricted to recordings from the Trailer label, but I cannot believe this is the best they could do. Both quality and quantity are lacking. A sad leave-taking indeed."
5,Just what I needed.,This book taught me all the basic drills and then some. I feel I am really ready to work with my team.
1,Not worth it,"We got this for a gift -- I'm shocked to see how expensive it is to purchase...I seriously thought it was a $5.00 toy. Awkward to use and doesn't allow kids to really jump the way they can with a regular pogo stick. If you're going to spend this kind of money, get a real pogo stick."
1,Gives worthless trash a bad name,"This book gives worthless trash a bad name. I only finished it because I wanted to see if the simple-minded plot had a final twist as some sort of redemption, but it didn't. As a clue, the only mystery in the whole sorry mess is how the editor and publisher allowed the author to use two different names for the perpetrator. The characters are deeply unsympathetic caricatures, the local colour about St Paul is sub-tourist info (don't go in summer, it's hot) and the prose style is somewhere between made-for-TV movie script and computer generated text. The publishers should be ashamed of themselves. If you ever see a copy of this book anywhere, do the rest of the world a favour and chuck it in the nearest shredder."
3,Quite a few loose ends in this one.,"I found that this thriller left quite a few loose unexplained threads when the story ended. I liked Broker, and think he has possibility to be a good main character, but I found that he wasn't actually shown in the best light in this one. He was hired on as a special consultant to find the person who is going around killing presumed pedophiles. He does some preliminary background checks, but I found he really didn't follow up on a lot of the information that he supposedly got. He seemed to be along for the ride when the plot stepped up and got there more or less by accident when things started happening. Too many loose ends to mention without giving the story away, so not, I'm afraid, my favourite thriller."
2,S2K777,"It doesnt fit my 2003 Honda Element. I guess they didnt measure it right. It is made with good materials, the one for my S2000 fits perfect."
4,Vocab List VERY HELPFuL,It has a very extensive vocabulary list with almost every SAT word possible! (I would say about 99% of all words are listed). They also provide sentences with word which helps tremendously in understanding the word in context. I would highly recommend this book if you need to improve your vocabulary.
4,Funny stuff,"This is the first SAT prep book with a sense of humor that I've ever run into. The grammar section is full of silly examples that add life to what is far too often a dry subject, and some of the wrong answers in the multiple choice sections are pretty funny, though you have to pay close attention to notice those.The verbal sections are great. The book provides clear, specific explanations for each answer. The glossary in the middle of the book also defines EVERY word used in the sentence completion practice tests."
4,Good study material for preparing SAT I,"I used the mathematics portion of this book for my SAT prep class students. It is pretty good even with detail solutions. However, it did have a few mistakes due to typo errors. Overall, it is a good study material for SAT I."
3,Good for extra practice exercises,This book has many practice exercises that are hard enough to be good prep for the test.It's major flaw is the lack of explanation for why a given answer is correct.If you need a book that explains how to arrive at the correct answers I suggest buying Rocket Review as the book actually teaches you basic principles that explain how the test works and how to beat it.
5,"""Quirky"" and that makes it great","This is one of my favorite movies and I really want it to come out on DVD. The characters in the story are great and there are quite a few things that are a little weird, twisted, or unexplained so there are things to think about once it's over. If you like films like John Paizs' ""Top of the Food Chain"" or his ""Crime Wave"" then I think you'll appreciate ""Out There"" too."
4,it is interesting.,"it is not technical skill book. but if you have a think about adapted physical education, it would be interesting. it say that a boy with C.P. enjoy ski at first. only story, but it will move you."
4,A quick satisfying read,"Bonita Wagner's latest novel, though short, is a fast and satisfying read.It's the latest fad drug and it's called 'Boomers'. It's highly addictive. Teenage girls are being talked into trying it, and when they get hooked, they gladly sell there bodies for more. When a bad batch gets out, lives are lost. Mostly young teenagers. This is when Texas rangers' Travis and Manny get on the case.The story should be aimed at parents and teenagers. A rather moral tale that describes some of the perils of teenage drug use. There is suspense to go with the emotion. It's also laced with humor, especially when it comes to Manny and Travis. Being a short novel, as this was, it did lack some depth but it still kept me in my chair."
5,An Experience of Ecstacy,"I found myself moved by the many feelings and moods evoked by the mostly short, seemingly unrelated passages separated by spaces on the pages of Ecstacy by Dr. Michael Eigen. Some of these passages describe clinical episodes, living interactions between the author and his patients. Some express thoughts and truths which the author seems to have had percolating within him for ages. Ideas and images seem to burst forth unpredictably yet subtly connected to each other and to everything else on the pages.Reading this flow seems to release my own thoughts and images. I have the feeling of participating in an open and ongoing creative process that does not end with the actual reading but continues into my work, thoughts of my life-all suffused with a powerful uplifting feeling; A kind of ecstacy."
4,Hand of Fate - review,"This is the first of Michael Underwood's books that I have tried and I found it to be a very enjoyable read. It was exceptionally easy-going - perfect for bedtime reading. There were not too many characters introduced at once, and just enough background information was provided without unduly detracting from the main story. The supposed twist in the tale was predictable from a very early stage, but this did not spoil the form of the story, and an element of suspense did remain. I will certainly be reading other books by this author, and I would recommend him to anyone who enjoys vintage Agatha Christie, but is frustrated by not being given sufficient clues to solve her mysteries."
5,Excellent,"Barry Long is one of my favorite spiritual master, his clarity and insight is so deep and he penetrates and speaks about different subjects with such clarity.This book is about sex and love and how we distinguish. It give you a totally new perspective. Read it and change...enjoy"
1,Buyers remorse,"Like one other reviewer said, the nut needs lock-tite. I bought it at walmart as impulse buy to clear some small trees and limbs that are not worth taking out the chain saw on our property growing over some atv trails. The very first limb I cut I tossed it back in the atv storage bin and when I pulled it out a little later it was in two pieces in the bin. The bolt was there but nut was no where to be found. Went back to look for it but with all the mud and puddles I could not find it. Sorry I bought it."
5,Nate the Great: Many Years of Reading Wonder!,"Nate the Great and the Lost List was one of many in the series that we were privileged to share over the course of his childhood. Nate the Great opened the world of reading to both of my sons. Because Marjorie Weinman Sharmat is a master of using specific aggregates of words for each story, both of them began to read without much difficulty as a result of these tremendous stories. Over and over again, this wonderful series of books brought the inner thoughts of children into written form. I came across the series the other day, tucked safely away for any grandchildren that might come along."
1,"Small Typeface, Poor Colors!","""The Unreadable Will Rogers"" is a better title for this book. The designers opted to print the quotes in solid caps in a pale orange color typeface that is very, very difficult to read. When the quotes appear over a half-tone illustration, the text is, in fact, unreadable. The picture captions are printed in red in footnote-size type and are also very difficult to read. To enjoy this book you will need 20/20 eyesight, a good magnifying glass, and no color blindness problems. A real pity! It might have been a good book!James B. Saunders, Astoria, NY"
2,Not as good as it could be,I would have preferred some of his show material. It was interesting and Ienjoyed the book but it did not contain enough of his quotes.
3,just good,"another kind of popy album, like african bach, or phantom power, is missing something, its like mmmm no effort on it, the only good song here is after prayers, just if you are a very serious fan if not, dont waste your money"
3,Hard to Say!,"The Lee legacy lives on in Shannon. However, why would the studios not give her a better vehicle to show case her stuff. She is beautiful, has the Lee intensity, and can fight a bit too. This movie focused on this stupid acting, hick-type character most of the time with Shannon more of a supporting actor. I just hope she lives a happy long life and maybe has a son who will continue the Lee legacy without mishap."
4,Good Mesh Bag,"I use ""un-paper"" towels in my kitchen and bathrooms so I use these mesh bags to line the laundry baskets that used towels go in. I then just pull the drawstring closed and drop the whole bag in the washer. Easy as pie! I got 4 of these so I can put another in the basket while one is in the wash. The draw string lock looks pretty sturdy and so far the bags have held up in the washer and dryer just fine! The only reason I didn't give a 5th star is that the seams are a bit ragged (but they still look sturdy) but its not like I show off my dirty laundry to neighbors so its not that big of a deal. Over all, I'm very happy with this purchase. The only other thing that would have been better is cheaper shipping. I wish the shipping didn't cost more than the bags themselves."
2,What a dirty trick,I was seduced by the sinister cover and the synopsis on the inside cover into thinking this was going to be a chilling account- Account my foot! I gingerly turned the first page and instantly drowned in wave after wave of details. As if the rough draft was a series of scraps stapled together and mailed off to an impatient publisher
4,A really interesting part of WWII that I never knew before.,"A fascinating story about another way the Germans persecuted the countries they conquered during WWII. The writing is not great and there are problems of a linear time-line, but overall an interesting read because it is very obvious the author did a lot of research into this seldom written about part of the war."
3,German arrogance and art dealer greed in WWII.,"A repititious summary of art work confiscations by the Nazis, particularly from Jewish galleries, during World War II. Plentiful accusations of greed by cooperating art dealers, including some famous names, during and after the war. The French government to this day has performed questionably in returning works by famous artists to their pre-war owners. The Swiss government, in harmony with its management of Jewish refugee bank deposits, has performed even worse. Over-all, a depressing litany of evil deeds in a poorly structured account of art world activity during the German occupation of France."
3,a narrow perspective,"The title of this work should have been something like ""Knaves of Art: The complicity of the Paris art market in Nazi theft of Jewish art in World War II."". As such it is well enough told in an episodic way, highlighting through description the moral and ethical positions taken by many people who surely knew what was happening. The pictures of the art galleries disposed of and the pieces of art still missing bring forth both sadness and indignation. This book is not anything like a comprehensive study of the overall Nazi plunder of art which needs to be sought elsewhere. With a more honest title this book might have deserved four stars. Fault the publisher more than the writer."
2,A Big Hit in France? Go Figure...,"This was a big hit in France when it came out, but as an English-language book it suffers by comparison to Lynn Nicholas's magisterial 'Rape of Europa,' a vastly better book on the same topic--better written and better researched. Feliciano takes what is, in and of itself, a fascinating, profound story and cheapens it with his overheated writing style. Also, he claims to have made a lot of new documentary discoveries--the Schenker papers, documenting the shipment of looted works within France--which aren't so new, as anyone who reads Nicholas's book knows. Those documents have been publicly accessible since the late 1970s. On the whole I would not recommend this book, but would recommend the Rape of Europa instead."
4,As Described!,"I was looking for a dozen Wiffle balls and found exactly what I needed. I was hoping to find a set not individually wrapped, but this is what was available."
5,The real thing,"Don't be fooled by generic perforated baseballs. My son and his friends have been known to destroy the noname balls with one whack, but the genuine Wiffle brand balls will last until they lose them."
5,Wiffle balls,These are the best wiffle balls on the market! Its a good price for the best! I used every other ball on the market and they all broke! Never broke one of these yet!
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A fun bunch of nostalgia, of the good old days when the Justice League of America used the old vibrational trick to journey to Earth-2, or the Justice Society did the same thing to travel to Earth-1.Of course, the villains see that as an opportunity to take out a bunch of heroes at once."
3,Some annoyances keep it from greatness,"Choice of topics is great. My main annoyance is the lack of suitable references to further explore the important topics that are sketched. The writing is often stilted and so confusing in some parts that you have to read the solution in order to understand the problem. I blame the editors for that. There are some real gems in the problem sets, especially with respect to the tangency principle. This is a good place for people who actually work optimization problems in real life, beyond the math competitions this book is geared to, to understand at a top-level how the methods can be employed. The notation could be more consistent throughout or at least provide a Notations page to facilitate nonlinear reading."
2,train toddler costume,"This costume was cute and comfortable for my twins. However, the costumes arrived completely crushed and misformed. It was very difficult to get them back to their original shape. I had to make a hole, stuff the face, then re-sew it back together. Too much work for the price!!"
3,A good solid cable kit for any PS/2 KVM,"As this product states, it works with most KVM systems and I did not find a single issue with this product other than I still kept having problems with my wireless Elite keyboard/mouse setup. If you are using this with a standard wired keyboard/mouse setup it should work fine and it may even work with other wireless keyboard/mouse setups but as for the Microsoft Elite setup I kept having issues.The lengths for the cables are just right and will extend well. The only thing I did notice which was a bit strange is that all of the cables were separate and were not conjoined and molded into one single cable with the heads being split at the end like other KVM cables. Now this is a plus or an annoyance depending on your preference.Other than that, no issues or complaints on the cables themselves. They are well insulated with a nice thick jacket for each cable."
3,"Easy to install, better power and some help on MPG","I have had this for about four months now and I have been pleased with the overall performance. First the installation was pretty easy to do and I am just your average guy. The instructions were fairly clear, some parts were a bit hard to figure out from the photos, but all in all it was easy. Installation took me about one hour.Having used it for aout four months now it seems to be working good. I can tell the increase in hp when it is needed, such as passing, towing, etc. I was hoping it would improve gas mileage but it only increased it about 1 mpg.This is good if you want increased power but I wouldn't do it for the mpg.One last thing, check the bolts and screws at least once a month as they can loosen a bit."
2,NOT for the CBT TOEFL and not much information!,"This book is a good start, but it does not even come close to preparing you for all the material you will see on the TOEFL.For example, the grammar review is TOO short for most of my students; I must use other books to supplement this book.The book is pretty long, but most of the book consists of practice tests--Princeton Review puts one question on each page (trying to simulate what the computer will look like). For example, the last 150 pages of the book are ONE test.Finally, the CD-ROM is NOT a Computer Test. You will get only some listening practice.Get the Longman book instead!"
3,Burnt palm!,"It's pretty, whistle is clear, handle is extremely hot on stovetop! I have a gas stove, even set on medium the handle was burning hot!"
1,Terrible product,The first headset I received would not pair with my phone. I returned it and the relpacement unit will not even charge. My impression is that the quality is quite low and that these are not reliable units. I am returning this for a refund.
2,"Functional, but cheap and uncomfortable","I had no problem pairing this headset with my PC and using it for Skype. The call quality is adequate, with plenty of volume but a distracting amount of static, regardless of where I place the Bluetooth receiver. It holds a battery charge well and warns when it's getting low.The manufacturing quality of the piece is terrible though. It feels very cheap and is uncomfortable. Comments about the headset being designed for a 5 year old are exaggerations, but just barely. The headset is very small and the adjustments are hard to make without feeling like you're going to break the head loop. Because of the angle and placement of the adjustment slide on the loop, trying to make it bigger actually pushes the other side's grip pad further into your head at an angle. The pad is just a rigid piece of toothed plastic with no actual padding for comfort.I bought this at a deep discount and still don't feel it was worth the money."
4,Goldylocks finds her match,"I must have tried 8 to 10 headsets before finding this one. A very expensive endeavor! The earloop ones don't stay on my ears, the ear bud ones hurt my ears, other over the head sets are too bulky or heavy or tight fitting. This one fits perfectly for me.This is actually the second time I've gotten this particular headset. The first one lasted a little over 2 years when the clip that holds the adjuster part broke and the mic boom detached from the speaker. So I thought I'd get the ""upgraded"" one. Another expensive mistake. Now, I'm back to the tried and true. And I'm very happy with it. Granted it could use some minor fixes but I'm good with the way it is for now.The sound quality is excellent. People I talk to usually don't even know I'm using a headset. And the unit is so light I always forget I'm wearing it. All in all, a good buy for the price."
4,DVI Cable,"The calbe worked right out of the box, it was less expensive cost for this product from other online source. Thank You!"
2,"Ok, but disappointed","The book was nothing of what I expected,own fault. I guess I was expecting manymore photographs of the various High Society familys.Instead I received a book of small blurbs, almost telephone book-ish, about the familys. THere are about 20 or so families pictured witha few small collections of pictures. Would work for a reference book I suppose."
4,xj,"I bought mine about a year. Very easy to install. Sounds good as well. Only flaw is i left the bottow of my old air bix in, had to modify it a little. When the bottom air box is out alot of water splashes up into the filter. Over all excellent product and would buy again."
3,Historical reference of etiquette in the 1930s,"My family has a original copy of this book, printed sometime in the 30s. Since it's vintage and we'd like to keep it nice so I was looking for a digital copy of it. Yes the subject matter is horribly outdated but it's still a good historical reference on manners and etiquette of that time. You no longer need to wait for a gentleman to escort you to the dinner table at a party. You no longer need to choose between college and being a debutante (you can't do both) and you most certainly can swear now ( in the right effing circumstances ). And although times have changed isn't it fascinating at the standards then compared to the standards now. I sincerely doubt the original reviewer truly read this book. Because if she had she would have realized it was for a era that has long since past. So if you are looking for a historical reference of what was expected of a lady in the 1930's this is good book to read."
1,PATHETIC,"I know plenty of girls who swear. Take my advice, don't waste your time reading some junk that someone wrote complaining about swearing. Get a life is what i have to say. Swearing is part of life so GET USED TO IT!!!! What a waste of precious time!"
2,the town that was,"We were very disappointed .Film seemed to center around one person,not the people that had lived there. While we liked seeing the current state of the town,it would have been more of what we wanted if they included more interviews with others & where they are now."
5,Cool movie,We only live a few miles from the town and it was nice to see the history of what happened.
4,Spooky,"This is a captivating movie, certainly for me. I drove through Centralia a number of times some years ago, both in the very early days of the fire when the town was essentially intact, and after it had become a smoking ghost zone with contorted roads and scary subduction zones. And virtually no people. I learned a lot about this largely unknown little town from this documentary. Nicely done."
4,Good Movie,"This was an intersting and informative movie about Centralia, PAIf you want to know more about this town get the movie."
5,The Best Book on Indian Cooking,"Excellent pictures that guide you to delicious Indian Cooking, with useful tips, a great gift for a new bride"
5,Easy to use,Bought this to carry bundled cartons into buildings. The velcro system is very easy to use while the handle makes this just what I needed.
3,Purchased for hair use,"I gave it 3 stars because I am still waiting to see if it helps my hair. I use the powder of one capsule a night dissolved in a teaspoon of ACV to stimulate the scalp area in which my hair has broken off down to 1/8 and 1/4 of a inch long!(read this treatment on line). this is not the only thing I do, just part of my regimen. Will have to see how this helps. If happy, I will upgrade my rating."
3,Great Expectations Dashed,"As someone who is just learning to play the harmonica, I was anxious to acquire a couple of CDs featuring this instrument. I found the album to be dissappointing. The last two tracks on the album are clearly the best. Charlie McCoy's rendition of Shenandoah is hauntingly beautiful and Orange Blossom Special is a virtuoso performance. I wish the rest of the tracks were equally strong. Unfortunately, they are not. First, the harmonica was barely featured in a couple of the tracks. I kept wondering when I was going to hear a harmonica. Second, the orchestrations weren't very impressive. Third, this CD is definitely ""old country western"" in style. I don't mind country-wetsren per se but I have to admit I can't stand the sound of the sliding steel guitar. It's like listening to fingernails being scraped across a blackboard. Unfortunately, there is a LOT of sliding steel guitar on this CD. Shenandoah and Orange Blossom Special almost make it worth the cost of the CD . . . almost."
5,A Literary Treasure,"I've always loved reading Mary Oliver's poetry, but hearing her own voice adds new depth of meaning to the words. She is a literary treasure!Carol Grever"
4,Mary Oliver's reading,"The DVD itself is technically a little wanting -- the recordings of the poet reading clearly come from a variety of different events and are patched together with varying levels of care. However, the poems are beautiful and it is a joy to hear Oliver's voice speaking them."
5,Exceeded my expectations!,The sound quality and accompanying documentation is top quality. I would recommend this item to anyone who appreciates exceptional poetry.
5,INTELLIGENT LITERATURE WHERE THE CHARACTERS SEEM REAL,"This book will always be on my favorites list. I enjoyed it first for the insightful Christian wisdom that I found throughout the book. Secondly, I enjoyed it for its colorful characters that seemed to reach out and grab hold of my heart. These were characters I got to know intimately. And thirdly, I love the rich descriptions of the Appalachian Mountains and the stress of a community with safety and charm being thrust into a more progressive community.This is a book that I could not put down, anxiously reading forward to find out the secrets of its characters. The book parallels stressful situations in today's world: the loss of a spouse and child, battling materialism, being forgiven but yet still burdened by past sins in your life, division within the family, etc. I'm sure anyone reading this book will find that it was well worth the commitment of time and heart."
4,Manilla Road - 'Atlantis Rising' (Iron Glory),"Good 2001 comeback effort {after almost ten years} from Wichita, Kansas power metal band Manilla Road. I had recently caught these guys playing a club in Kansas City, MO - after remember catching them in an even smaller hole-in-the-wall just over twenty years ago. Tunes here that had me sit up and take notice were ""Megalodon"", title track ""Atlantis Rising"", ""March Of The Gods"" and the acoustic well-written ""Flight Of The Ravens"". Didn't realize they were now a four piece but here's this CD's line-up: founder Mark {The Shark} Shelton-guitar & vocals, Bryan Patrick-lead vocals, Mark Anderson-bass and Scott Peters-drums. Might appeal to fans of Testament, Powermad (anyone even remember those guys?), Budgie, Metal Church and possibly Iron Maiden or even early Scorpions."
5,Not Your Usual Baby Oil,The Weleda baby oil is way better than the baby oil that you get at any supermarket or drugstore. It gets absorbed into the skin nicely and doesn't make your baby look like a grease ball. Makes baby's skin softer than ever. The scent is light and non-offensive. Excellent for baby massage.
1,Waste of .99,"After reading Chasing Rainbows, I thought this would be a good read. Sorry to say NO! Save your money. Run, don't walk, in the opposite direction. Cherry on Top is a trick, not a treat."
3,"Cute Story, Likeable Characters","It's a cute story with likeable characters thrown into funny situations. Cherry, our heroine, decides to remake herself after she and her sister Liz win the lottery. Liz goes along with her plan and they head off to Florida. Escaping the past is not that easy, however, and in fact can be pure chaos.The romances are fairly predictable and kind of drag on, which is my only complaint. The rest of it I enjoyed - Lucky, Yogi, Moose, Monty, even Fran's appearance made me chuckle. The hijinks from the sisters and their relationship with one another in general were fun to read."
3,Fun to read,"This was fun to read, but also predictable. The characters are good and have some depth to them. Luke has a surprising side to him. A good book for vacation or a weekend."
3,Cherry on Top,I will peruse AMAZON to read the follow up books. This story was entertaining and I may read it again. I do look forward to the future books by this author.Thanks
4,Fun Fast Paced Read,"As usual, author Kathleen Long has delivered a cast of zany off-beat characters. This author has a great way of making a novel flow and keeping your attention. I went back and forth on this review between 3 and 4 stars. I ended up at 4 because I feel that at a Kindle price of $0.99 this book will beat out almost all of the competition. The characters in the story are all interesting. It's pretty much a mindless read that will give you a chuckle. Please don't expect this book to be anything deep and meaningful. It's a fast paced, fun story for a lazy afternoon. I considered a 3 star review becuase it truly isn't as good as some of the authors other novels of which I have also given some 4 stars. However, I need to judge this book on itself vs. other kindle choices. If you are deciding between this book and other books by this author I would strongly suggest reading Love Unlisted.I would not recommend this book for young adults or readers that don't enjoy silly characters. Enjoy!"
3,Its ok,I read her other book - Chasing Rainbows which I would highly recommend.I startd this one right after and it wasn't as gripping. Did finish and it was enjoyable.
2,Comprehensive but confusing,"This guidebook seems to be very comprehensive and complete, but the layout is not very clear. If I want to do a long hike or backpack from one trail head to another, the layout of the book makes if very difficult to figure out where to pick up the next trail to link the route together. Probably what is most confusing here are the maps. Many of the maps just end at the edge of the map and it's difficult to determine where in the book to pick up the next map that will allow me to complete my planned route. The layout just doesn't seem as clear as it could be for route planning.I do like how the maps show distances between points though. Profile data for the routes along with the maps would be nice though.Overall it's a nice guidebook with lots of information and good descriptions of the routes, but the layout seems to be the only drawback and it makes route planning more difficult than some other guidebooks I've used."
5,Margaret is the Best,"Having lived near the Sawtooth Mountains for 5 years and hiked many trails there I found Margaret's trail descriptions to be right on. She is witty, poetical, and as precise as she can be about directions."
1,oh my,"Don't bother. A lot of hype for a re-released CD that wasn't very good! The keyboarding is very good, but the usual voclas and accomaniment lead to a quice bore. Sorry"
1,Too much story...,"I was so excited to get this cd for my 3 year old daughter. The music from these movies are so pretty and it keeps her ocupied in the car. I was very disappointed that it wasn't just the songs, it was half the movie leading up to the songs. She doesn't really care for it and we have to fast forward every song to get to the music."
3,Kind of disappointed,"My daughter loves the Barbie Princess movies and in fact was given a box set of DVDs for her birthday. Naturally, she loves the music from the films, too, but I was disappointed in this compilation. Why? Because my Princess and the Pauper DVD came with a music CD that had seven of these songs, and if you want to get technical, I think the first 11 tracks on THIS CD are from Princess and the Pauper (reprises are not on the CD that came with my DVD). Since I already have half the music already, I really don't feel compelled to spend the money on this collection."
5,Oh YEA!!!,I say that the best songs are from The princess and the PauperBut i guess alll of them are good!!!you should buy this its worth it!!!!
4,NICE CD WITH NICE SONGS,"THSI CD HAS VERY NICE SONGS IN IT. IT INCLUDES ALL THE SONGS FROM THE FILM. ARRIVED ON TIME, IN EXCELLENT CONDITION."
3,Power rangers Im dreaming of a white ranger.,This is a holiday video involving the power rangers when Lord Zedd tries to take over Christmas for the rangers and children all over the world.Great holiday video even though I dont get what they are dreaming on since Tommy's already the white ranger.
5,Fantastic Watch Winder,"Hello,If there is anyone looking for a quality Watch Winder,for a good pricethen this is the place too look.I purchased a very well made watch winder about a week ago,and to be honest, when I saw the price I was thinking this must be a mistake.It arrived just the other day. When I opened the box,and removed said winder. I was blown away,it was Beautiful! I thought maybe someone made a mistake and sent the wrong winder, it was certainly worth more then I paid. I looked up the winder again,and sure enough,it was the right winder. I took all my Automatic watches that had not had a home and placedthem in the winder,set the winder,plugged it in, I was amazed at the quiet. This is a beautiful addition to my Watch Collection.Thank you for this Wonderful Winder! I will be telling all my watch friends,about this purchase.Fantastic Winder ! :)S-fo-56Washington State"
4,Get it all,"Fueled by funky rhythms and gutsy, soulful singing, ""You Could Have It All"" is Pamela Rose's latest CD of original songs. She can make you laugh (""She's Not Dressed Up For You""), give you goosebumps (""You Could Have It All"", a duet with Glenn Walters), and tug at your heart (""This Love Is Gonna Do Me In"").If you are a fan of R&B in general, and the Hammond B3 organ in particular, you will love this CD.I also can't resist plugging Glenn Walter's new CD, ""The King of Retro Cool"", which is also wonderful."
3,Billy Joel Not as his best,"This album is a bit disappointing, not necissarily because it is bad, but it is just not Billy Joel at his best. It seems that he has almost completely given up the piano in the album and gone for a more fast-pace pop style. The album really lacked the punch that has come to be the trademark of Billy Joel. It is still enjoyable, I have just come to expect more from Billy Joel"
4,"""Leaving the scene of the crime.""","Actually, let's make that 4 1/2 stars. While Storm Front is not quite up to the high-water mark of Joel's Nylon Curtain and 52nd Street, it's close enough to make it one of his strongest efforts. Songs like That's not her Style, I Go to Extremes, and We Didn't Start the Fire(which upon its release as a single had to be one of the most-creative hits ever) remind me of Phil Spector's ""wall of sound,"" an approach that usually masks mediocre songwriting, but in the case of these tunes, makes for a dynamic combination. The songs are perfectly crafted, melodic, crisp and strong. The Downeaster Alexa, written with Joel's daughter in mind, is amazingly un-syrupy, while And So it Goes is his most beautiful song."
1,The Very Worst of the Best...,"Stay far away from this album. Not only is there no trace of piano here, but it is overflowed with rancid pop songs, country styled flops, and senseless tunes with wierd sound effects. The only good song on this collection is ""I go to extremes"", and THAT can be found on the greatest hits album. Billy should have stopped when he had writer's block."
4,A Valid Support System,This book gives everyone a shoulder to lean on in times of confusion in the work place. TD Jakes has a very good way of putting negative situations into a positive perspective...on a spiritual level.
1,What's going on here?!,"I really don't know how this book has a dozen positive reviews and no realistic ones.I bought this book at the airport, based solely on the title. I assumed it discussed how to handle an unpleasant work environment and not allow the negativity therein to be destructive.The book's idea of a ""hostile"" work environment turned out to be one that was not deeply Christian. The book makes virtually no sense, reading like a sermon.So far as legitimate advice, I found little, and certainly none that was unique. The useless advice was shocking - the book had might as well be entitled ""How To Fail In Business By Preaching Religion To Your Coworkers"".I'm going to be a lot more suspicious for a while about book purchases. If the title makes me suspect it's just weak religious material, I'll try to decide this before buying it.I can't imagine the misery of working with someone who thought that this was even an OK book, let alone good."
5,Best TV you can Purchase,"This is the Best HDTV that you can buy. The DLP picture quality is so far superior to LCD or Plasma. The sound quality is fantastic. The built in pedestal is awesome.1 complaint: The remote control could be better, get a logitech remote or use the cable box remote."
5,Awesome picture...,"The picture right out of the box is incredible. I have Dish network HD package. When I powered on the TV and watched the HD channnel, the picture is stunning. The colors are bright and the black levels are excellent. I researched for the TV so long and ended up with this beautiful piece. Just buy it and enjoy. It is stylish. I recommend it."
3,Strange...,"Hunter's Tracks is the story of an African white hunter who is involved in investigating and apprehending a middle man in the elephant poaching trade. Interspersed at frequent intervals are unrelated stories from Mr. Hunter's career. I found this to be a strange book on two accounts. 1) The main story is not as interesting as the stories which are mixed in, and Hunter agrees; 2) there is at least one story which I find to be a tall tale - a man killing two attacking leopards simultaneously with his bare hands. After reading ""Hunter"", the author's first book, which is superb, I was dissapointed with this one, although there are some good stories."
4,Great Price and good BD-RE discs,These are great discs. They burn very well. I have not had any issues with these discs and would recommend these to anyone. The shipping was fast.
2,"Daughters of Fortune, Book 3",This book was advertised as new. It is in good condition but the bottom of the book is discolored from I think being in he sunlight. The top is not quite as noticeable but does not look new. I bought this as a gift and I am now hesitant to give it as one.
5,Daughters of Fortune series,"Great reading! Can't wait to read more by Judith Pella her stories keep you interested to the end and wanting more when you finish. She is a ""true"" author."
4,Excellent grammar practice,"My children used Easy Grammar in their private school, so for homeschooling, it seemed like a good idea to be consistent and use something familiar to them. Easy grammar is great because it presents the rules of grammar in a concise understandable manner. It also presents the concepts in small chunks that are easy to digest. After the material is presented, several practice exercises are provided to solidify the concepts in the minds of the students.A companion book to Easy Grammar is the Daily Grams. Daily Grams provides daily practice and review of multiple grammatical concepts to help your students keep remember everything they learn.Easy Grammar is great because it is thorough but easily doable, making grammar less of a chore."
1,If New to Bosu....Don't bother!,"Hard to follow, waaaay to fast paced. She does this for HER enjoyment, not yours. Found many more GOOD routines on You Tube. Sorry to have bought this. BIG mistake!"
4,awesome,"The title is not lying. So many soups! No pictures though, and that's a little disappointing (but this whole series lacks pictures so...not unexpected.) Very handy go-to soup book."
3,the everything soup cook book,there is a lot to chose from but yet to find a soup i really enjoyed alot of basic riecpes
1,Not for Portable Hard Drives,"Not sure what the problem is, but this cable will not work with either of the two Western Digital Passport drives I tried. It works with a Nikon D200, so it isn't just ""broken,"" but it will not spin the drive in the Passport. Other USB cables of the same length, plugged into the same ports, work perfectly."
2,Wrong size,"The photo is misleading, making it look like the product I wanted. In the end, exchanging would have been too much of a hassle. So it lives in my junk drawer"
1,Disappointing,"As many other reviewers have mentioned, there is a problem with this cable and western digital drives. Also, the cable won't work with my external usb speakers. Seems ok with cameras though, but disappointing given this is supposed to be an above average cable..."
1,I may be cheated,"I just received this cable from this seller. I am not sure if they sent me the right cable because it does not at all look like that of the picture shown here or the one displayed at Fred Meyer with the same SKU number. I am not going to call this seller for verification, but I am sure I have been cheated."
2,DOES NOT FIT the Mophie Juice Pack Air,"I mistakenly read a review here stating that it fit Mophie products. Well, I guess I found out the hard way that it DOES NOT fit all Mophie products... especially theMophie Juice Pack Air Case and Rechargeable Battery for iPhone 4 (Red) (Fits AT&T; iPhone).Just so you know.Now if anyone knows of a 6-foot replacement USB that DOES fit the Mophie Juice Pack Air for the iPhone 4, reply here please!"
3,An Interesting Read,"The storyline of this book was wonderful. I am not normally a scrience fiction reader, but I found myself turning one page after another to see where the story was going. This book makes one think about what--or who--may be out there--and what their intentions may be. I would have liked to see a glossary included to help with the military terminology used, but was able to figure out the meaning enough to still enjoy the story!! This is a wonderful read, especially for avid science fiction readers."
3,A very entertaining story,"Author Phillip Beebe is a talented story teller. I found this book to be a real page turner. Beebe's familiarity (I'm guessing actual experience) with the military was evident, as the story is told from a military perspective, and the dialog was convincingly authentic and crisp. I would have given this book a four star rating at least, but I found the substandard editing to be a distraction as I read. I thought enough of the author's writing skills to contact him and discovered this was his first book, and he himself is chagrined at the editing, but apparently it was one of those ""out of my control"" issues that first time authors sometimes get burned with. Still, overall it is a worthy read, and I was left with the impression that I would like to read some of Beebe's more recent books. He's a good writer."
3,"Thought Provoking, but Steeped in the Lingo of the Genre","Conspiritorial writing at its best and worst. This book has enough facts, coincidences, and historical references to make a conspiratorialist out of anyone. Unfortunately, the author has difficulty seperating his emotion from his reason and this shows in his writing. Instead of presenting his thesis and supporting information from a factual/rational perspective, he loads his dialog with dramatics. The sensationalist style can be an immediate turn-off to a reader not willing to see past the authors style to the heart of Marrs' argument. My advice is read past the words and take a look at the world around you, then draw your own conclusions."
4,Great Find,"I was lucky to find this book again, book is a great read would recommend to anyone that is willing to seek the truth."
5,Good quality,"These are good quality and feel very secure when used. You could not trim these to a smaller length without some serious re-stitching, so be sure to buy the exact length you need."
1,"good concept, poor production","This product is exactly what I wanted, unfortunately, I had to re-sew the velcro tabs on two of the straps. Two of the four have now come completely undone."
4,Lots of good ideas,"Enjoyed the book. There are lots of easy projects. The clothing is very teenish, but gives you lots of ideas how you might modify a tee that might not be so teenish. I look forward to getting the second book."
3,80's punk inspiration,"If you like the 80's punk style this book can be inspiring, if you can get away without wearing a bra this book can be very useful. The projects are cute and creative and simple enough for a beginning crafter. I think a tween or teen would really get into it - and with very few supplies needed. I've enjoyed looking through this book and have used it for inspiration now and then but that's about it for (almost 40) me."
3,You have to be a seamstress,"I have to say, these t-shirts are not as easily made as they lead you to believe. one of the ones i tried said 15 minutes...it took more like 3 hours and i came out looking like a stegosaurus. kinda cute but kinda weird and its really hard to make it look like its a quality product. sooo in theory i think its a great idea, i just didnt find it to be quite as easy as i was hoping."
5,I LOVE Generation T,"I purchased The Generation T book just a few days ago and I am so glad I did. All the instructions are easy to follow, you can use clothes that you already have for the projects plus they give little factoids throughout the book. It's fun and if you like DIY projects it can keep your interest until past 2am, lol. Buy it!"
3,T-shirt Madness,"Rip It!: How to Deconstruct and Reconstruct the Clothes of Your DreamsI got these two books together for my bday. I liked them both, but felt generation t could have provided more sewing techniques. All in all it is a good book. I would suggest it for a rainey day or to make shirts to club in."
2,meh,"couple cool ideas, but most of the 'projects' are throw-aways. if you're creative at all, you don't need this. it'd be fun for kids and teenagers, i suppose."
4,I love a lot of the ideas but...,"I felt really inspired by this book but I had one major problem with it. Most of the styles are impossible to wear with a bra. I suppose if you're very small busted (like the models in the book) this wouldn't be a problem but at a 36C, I really can't wear standard t-shirt material without a bra - it would be The Headlight Show! I think a few of them might be workable with some bra cups built in but not many. So if you aren't an A cup, this is still a great inspiring book but you might not find many of the styles wearable."
1,This book is no good,"I bought this book hoping there would be some wonderful and innovative patterns. I opened the book and to my surprise there was not many patterns, just 100 ways to cut holes in you t - shirts. So if your into slashing up your clothes with razor blades, than this book is for you!"
2,Not what I expected,This book is for people who are 20 years old and wear a size 4. Don't waste your $.
2,"Eh, just average","This book, 108 Ways to Transform a T-Shirt seems ungenuine and fake. The descriptions are difficult and the explanations unclear. Illustrations were decent but other than that I would recommend against this book."
1,thumbs down,"I tried one of the designs on a t-shirt, and ruined a perfectly good t-shirt. I don't know how they got the effects in the books, but they certainly didn't follow their instructions."
5,I already love it!,"I just got this book today. I've been wanting to make clothes for awhile, but patterns and such feel way to daunting with my limited sewing skills. I feel like this is the perfect segue into making my own clothes.And, many of the ideas are really cute and really easy! Even with my limited crafting skills, I am sure I can make some of these and make them look cute. I'm really excited to get started on some of these projects!! Just reading through the various projects has gotten me excited about the possibilities.I thought a lot of the designs are very '80's. That's my only real complaint. Though, perhaps I'll try to bring back some of the styles. ;) Or at least make them my own."
3,No sewing?,This book has little machine sewing projects in it. If you want to learn to just cut up Tees than this is a good book and I give 'em credit for the creativity. But I was looking for more sewing projects with Tshirts.
2,Repetitive designs and NO SEWING,If you do not sew and do not mind the same type of design slightly re-worked into ten different things than get this book. Most designs are slash and tie and require little to no sewing. Not what I had in mind.
4,Nice!,"I had seen this book many times in various craft stores I ventured in and have always wanted to have my own copy. I finally took the plunge and I'm happy I did! There are a few designs that don't really appeal to my taste, but that is the case with any book like this. There are more than enough designs in here that there is no way you won't find something you don't like. I highly recommend it!"
4,Great ideas but one problem...,...I'm not small enough for these outfits! All the girls modeling the clothes in the books pages are tiny thin; I should have taken that as a clue. I love the ideas in this book and it's a lot of fun; unfortunately I don't think they work unless you're very thin (if I'm wrong please say so - I'm dying to make a Simpsons altered tee!).
2,Not for non machine-sewers,"Such a cool concept - alas, since I am without a sewing machine, nothing I made was wearable. I know it says that you don't need one, but honestly, I'd be embarrassed to leave the house in the shirts I made. Yes, I'm not super-craftsy, but I gave it a good shot, and even hand-sewed a few things, yet I emerged quite disappointed. More emphasis needs to be given about the types of fabric you use - 100% cotton stretches out way too fast. The book is adorable and I'm sure it would be great for an even moderately-skilled seamstress. Also, if you're older than 25, you might look a little silly in most of these projects unless you're super-hip."
2,generation T 108 ways to transform a t-shirt,"I opted for this one over 99 ways and was very disappointed, though my kids are having fun with this book creating there own tees and having lots of fun. very simple easy to follow instructions."
2,NOT tbe best t-shirt alteration book out there!,"99 Ways to Cut, Sew, Trim, and Tie Your T-Shirt Into Something Special is DEFINITELY better than Generation T! While there are a couple of cute designs in Generation T, it is mostly just outlandish stuff that is a LOT more clownish than classy. Also, it is too cluttered of a book - too many sidebars, insert boxes, too much text. 99 Ways is very to the point, giving the patterns and being done with it. Nice. Invest your money in 99 Ways before you get Generation T."
2,Too Young,I am sorry to say I was disappointed with the product. The whole book is geared for the younger girls and I was looking for something for the more mature.
3,A Neat Book,"I really love this book. It has as lot of great ideas and cool crafty fixes. The instructions are very clear. The designs are very original and (for the most part) cool. The pictures are really nice, too, so you can see what you're making ahead of time.The thing I didn't like about the book was the sizing. All of the sizes run about XS-Large. Some items are only for small and medium sizes. I wish they had thought of larger sizes. This is definitely not a book for anyone XL or over. There were a few patterns that had Large sizes, and I was able to fit in them comfortably. Kind of a disappointment that not everything worked for me in the book, though. :("
4,Good Fun,This book was precisely what I wanted and at the right price too. I was looking for a halloween idea and found one in this book. Good way to transform those ratty old tshirts into something new.
4,Generation T-riffic!,"I really like this book because it is chock full of really fun ways to transform blah t-shirts into something unique. You really don't have to be an outstanding seamstress to do most of the projects either, which is great news for me. I hand-sewed one of the projects in about an hour and it looks fantastic. My mom was impressed anyhow."
5,Amazing Book!!!,this is one of the best books that i have i a while all that ideas are just simply amazing.
3,DIY Fun,this has a ton of ideas in it. Though most of the styles are ment for really skinny girls. I suppose if you had the gumption you could alter them for the normal to full figured gals.
4,"Pretty neat, but not for everyone","The most sewing I'd ever done before this was sewing buttons back onto shirts...but I found the instructions very clear and not at all intimidating. It does take a little practice to get the hang of cutting and fitting things just right, I recommend practicing on some old t-shirts you REALLY don't want. And it'd be a great deal easier with a sewing machine, which I don't have. (No wonder the Industrial Revolution kicked off with textiles...sewing by hand is VERY tedious).Like another reviewer said, many of the tops can't be worn with a bra, or will only look good/fit on gals who don't need bra support. I've pretty much given up on most of them, as I don't fall under that category. So keep that in mind, though there are plenty of other good projects like skirts and accessories."
4,buy this intead of Rip It!,"Much better than anything Elyssa Meyrich could ever dream up, this book actually has clothes I would want to wear. I am very much a DIYer, but my sewing skills suck hard. This book had me ripping up shirts the same night."
2,"Well, not totally bad but definitely not for me","I checked out this book from the library. Although I'm too old to wear such t-shirt styles, some were creative and looked nice on the models (I thought the flapper dress was cute). The overall organization of the book was good, and the instructions seemed thorough (I never tried making anything, though). Projects were typically illustrated with photos (completed project) and line drawings (intermediate steps). Anyway, if you're young and a beginning sewer, you might get something out of this book. For me it was just mildly interesting to flip through. I'd suggest previewing this book in the library or bookstore to make sure it's really what you want before buying it."
4,Generation T,"The book had a lot of good ideas, even thought of some alternatives to styles shown. The only thing I saw that disappointed me a bit, was that several of the styles were not anything I would ever wear."
3,Okay for the price,"Purchased this book for my teenage daughter who has been cutting her tshirts for a while now. She told me she wished the models were wearing bras, but other than that she gives it 2.5 stars. The projects are doable and has been keeping her busy."
2,Generation T,This is definitely for the younger generation.. it has a lot of ideas for someone who wants to do their own thing and not look like everyone else.there are some ideas for older people as well. this was NOT sent by amazon which I regret now. It was supposed to be New condition. When I received it ; it was wet from poor packaging..
3,"Not the best, but better than most","I have had this book for quite some time. I still use it every once in a while to get inspired. I have had some great results, and use the drawstring bad almost every day.But honestly some of the shirts are just not my style and look a little tacky. I even tried one 2 of the projects and they didn't work out for me AT ALL!"
3,nothing new,"I will start out by saying that this book is awesome for the person who has never ventured near a tee with scissors and razor blade in hand. The instructions are very clear and most often simple and easy to follow. Most of the designs are fairly basic and don't really require any previous sewing experience, though I would say if you want to get into any major restructuring of anything, sewing experience would be very helpful. My only issue with this book is the sizing issue I have run into with most of the patterns. I feel that the sizing in most patterns is for a flat-chested, less-shapely woman. I have had to adjust every shirt and skirt I have made. I am a size 8 or 10 and happen to be a bit busty (34DD) and have had issues with every top being too small in the bust. I would recommend this book to someone who is just discovering how fun it can be to recreate one's wardrobe, but for someone who has been doing it for a while may find the suggestions/patterns a bit been-there-done-that."
5,Ideas Galore!,"The best part about this book is since you are actually seeing how they construct these Items, you realize that you are not just limited to Tees anymore."
3,"Great - if you're under 25, hip and thin.","When I first flipped through this book I thought: fab! how imaginative. Unfortunately having looked at it more closely there isn't anything I think I could make that wouldn't make me look tragic. The ideas are mostly centred around the idea of cutting up a very large T-shirt and making it with minimal sewing into something hipper, close fitting and a little punk-inspired - plenty of rips and slashes. Even using the theme of the book, rather than the specific ideas doesn't help me much. I'm sure if I was 16 I'd love it. I write as a warning that the target audience for this book is relatively narrow ie young and that isn't something you might work out from reading the blurb. Well at least I didn't. Yes as you get older you can still be on-trend, but I really think it's better to leave looks such as slashed clothing or the barely-there items etc to the younger crowd."
3,generation t,"If you own a sewing machine, chances are you're way beyond this book. I don't find the ideas all that original, I've seen or done most of them before. They tell you how to do everything by hand but most of it would look and be a lot better if you used a machine. I think this book would be great for younger people whom are just starting to sew!!! It's a pretty good deal though, overall worth having laying around."
5,Just Great,I ordered this early Monday morning and got it Tuesday roughly about 1pm when the order wasn't suppose to arrive until around Friday. Took a couple shots with it and it is pretty good! Not an AF which is fine for me because I love manual. I would reccomend this for anyone who wants a pretty cheap telephoto lens that gets the job done and still puts out great images!
3,Hot Wheels Car Set,"I bought this because this was the only way to get another car. I got a better set the first time, but the car was lost with no way to get a replacement. The bigger set was better. This eats batteries like no tomorrow. The car was dropped and doesn't work very well anymore. A great toy for a few days. My 14 yo girl and 7 yo boy had a great time with it!"
3,material,"The material has very little give. I think it is much to heavy and if you are inclined to gain just a little excess weight, it is very uncomfortable."
1,not underware,I purchased a C-IN2 Men's Micro Fiber Lo No Show Brief. It was advertised as underware. Upon arrival I discovered that it is actually a bathing suit.
1,Dont buy from amazon!!!!!!,"Never got my costume or my money back!!!! It sucks that amazon wasn't there to help!!!! who do I call or how do I get my money back? I use to be a big fan of amazon,but no more!!! Don't ever buy anything from brands on sale people NEVER!!!!!!"
4,Mickey Rooney Christmas movie,I recorded this movie a long time ago and was glad to be able to get a copy.
3,Home For Christmas,"Ain't watched it yet, that's why I gave it a 3, but I'm sure I'll like it and it'll probably get a 5 after I see it, cuz, after all, it's Mickey Rooney, tho I don't quite get why the Amazon MajorDumbo assumes one watches DVD's as soon as you get them, which is hardly realistic considering Amazon's great prices"
4,It is what it is,This book is exactly what it says it is. It is a book of instructions on using the Logan Mat Cutter. I have an awesome Logan cutter and love it!!!! This book shows me how to cut fancy mats I haven't been able to do before. It is a welcome addition to my bookshelf.
1,Very Disappointed,"From reading all the reviews, I thought this product would work really well. I was very disappointed. I put a little in after washing my hair and I let it dry. It made my hair disgusting. It felt greasy, tangled, unmanageable, and my hair was dull looking. I have long wavy/curly hair, and I have to put mousse and some kind of product in it after washing so it doesn't dry frizzy, and I thought that this would help make my hair healthy looking, manageable, and soft as advertized, but it had the complete opposite effect. I'm never putting this stuff in my hair again. Maybe I'll save it to prank somebody, because that's all I can think of to do with it. Or maybe I can try putting it in BEFORE I wash my hair, because it looks terrible if left in. I assumed it didn't need to be washed out because all the other reviews said they left it in."
1,Terrible Service!!!!!,I HAVEN'T RECIEVED MY PRODUCT YET! IT'S BEEN MORE THAN A MONTH NOW!!!AND I CAN'T CALL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER AS I DON'T THINK IT REALLY EXISTS! MY MONEY IS GONE!I THINK I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF.FIRST AND LAST TIME I'LL BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON! THANKS FOR THE SERVICE GUYS!
4,insanely awewsome,"Having been a fan of the SF label's ""I remember syria"", I was pleased to see this on their ever-expanding menu. This has got to be the the most amazing party music that I've come across since hearing ivo papasov back in '89. the instrumentation is diverse on the label, but it all sounds like microtonal phaser swirl (that's a good thing!). basically, if you want to get your party started ""bedouin style"", pick this up. hell, knowing the way the ""world dance"" fad is going, M.I.A. will probably record with mr. souleyman on her next album, and you'll be hearing this stuff at the local club sandwiched between old school egyptian lover and the latest reggaeton banger..."
4,Old Zane Grey Western,"I read the book, Drift Fence, by Zane Grey and was delighted with it. When I saw there was a movie made from the book, I wanted to see it. The movie did not follow the book too closely but it was enjoyable, nevertheless. I am not a Western movie type of fan, but this was my first Zane Grey experience and I was impressed."
5,ALL-AMERICAN ALIENATED ANGST,"""Go tell the Superstar that all his hairs are turning gray!"" Ian, why did you make this album for an audience of one? Yourself! You Love England, You Hate England. Chained to this stake? I don't think so! Try the Bahamas! I do like the anti-tax rhetoric, though. Don't get enough of that from the artists! Please stick to subjects that other 'morons' can relate to AND ENOUGH AIRING OUT YOUR DIRTY LAUNDRY!!!! Rant into a dictaphone instead! Reclaim your throne and save us all from another Aerosmith commercial or Kiss farewell tour! Still got Overend's beeper number? Love Ya! I'll listen any damn thing you put out! Rant but just don't curse me mum! See ya in October! I'll be the LOUDEST one again!"
2,What did you expect from mellonhead's guitarist?,"Rest In Peace, Mick Ronson. You are conspicuous by your absence."
2,A Misfire,"This relauch disappointed me mostly because of the art. I don't believe Kitson draws these characters as teenagers (which is pretty important). The characters look like adults (and pretty generic ones at that) and don't convey the spark of youth or energy that I would think would be so vital for a book about teenage superheroes in the future. Waid's updates to the setup behind The Legion are for the most part improvements that expand and deepen the future environment and worlds represented; however, I feel the art hinders the book enough to make these enhancements incidental."
1,Makita should be ashamed - what a hunk of junk,"I am a long time Makita fan and I must say the LOW quality of this light is a shock to me. I bought it as part of a large kit of 18V tools so I really can't return it.First of all, I have the ""auto off"" feature. It can be sitting on a stable surface and POOF it goes out. Toggle the switch twice and back it comes. Will it stay on? Maybe, but don't trust it. (Not safe during Hurricane Irene!)Secondly, if you rotate the head while it is lit it can break the hot filament. Maybe this is ""operator error"" but once again I am plunged in to darkness. It took two bulbs to figure out what was killing them.Do yourself a favor, skip this light."
4,love it only because it came with my tool set,"I was so sad to have this stolen from me because to buy it alone seems a waste. It is not that sturdy but is seemed almost as bright as a car headlight. Loved it when the power went out. Sigh! Don't know if I would pay 40 or so bucks for it though. May be if I can find it for more around 25, I think that is a fair price for the chincy make."
2,"Pricey, and not really sturdy.","I expect more out of Makita. The swivel head has a lot of play in it, which gives it a flimsy feel. As much as this cost, and the Makita name, gave me some great expectations. This, however, didn't deliver.That said, it does put out quite a beam of light, and the 4 swivel angels are very handy."
5,Happy Camper!!!,"This was purchased to replace one my husband has had for years. His old one finally bit the dust after many, many years of use. He is an extremely happy camper!"
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Not a horrible flashlight, but for $40 you could search for something better. I bought it because I had batteries and a charger already, however I now regret my purchase. The bulbs included are NOT XENON as advertised. I read the description so I understood that the battery wasn't included, but all the pictures show that the battery comes with. Just seems like a very misleading product description. The build is kinda cheap and not what I expected from a Makita product. Search for something else with better reviews."
2,Flashlight,"This flashlight arrived in a cardboard without original packaging. Delivery time was good. Product is ok, not great. Sometimes the on/off button doesn't work and the light will cut out or not turn on for a couple of tries."
3,Not a bad flashlight.,It's worth the money if you already own the Makita tools. My big complaint is when I'm in a crawl space and put some weight on the top of the light it shuts off on its own. Not sure why.
1,bad,"I bought this flashlight advertised as brand new.When I got it, it stopped working the first day now Im paying to fix it. The MAKITA authorized dealer told me this light was refurbished I will never buy from this web site again."
1,Flimsy build,This flashlight is not build like the quality as their drills. The handle and battery holder are very solid but any above the handle are build like by cheap tools.. will not recommend this tool.
3,Overpriced,"I am a big fan of Makita tools. I have many Makita 18v tools and I love them. However, this is a lightweight, made in China, plastic flashlight. The rear on/off push-button is a poor design. Should have a front trigger switch which is much easier to use with one hand. I like the click-stop head positions. However, there are no other special features. This product should sell for $12..00 to $15.00."
1,very disappointing,"Wanted a good, bright rechargable flashlight. Already had these batteries and charger, so got the flashlight. Old fashioned and out-dated are the best words for it. Only has off-on switch, and a pivoting head, nothing more. Is an old-fashioned standard light bulb. Should have a focusable beam, it is not. Should have low, medium and bright, it is not. Should be LED or halogen or HID or any of the new high-intensity bulbs, it is not. For what it is, and what it does, it is worth $5-10, not more."
1,where's the battery and charger?,Wanted a really good flashlight and bought this one from amazon. It came with no battery and charger. The price of the battery and charger is way too much for me. Why sell this thing without the battery and charger. I sent it back and lost about $6 for the shipping. Bad choice. I still cannot find where it said that the flashlight came alone.
2,nice flashlight,Bought this to compliment my other 18V LXT tools. The filament broke while adjusting the tilt angle. The bulbs are hard to find but the 18v. dewalt replacement bulbs from Amazon worked fine.
3,Good product,Deceptive advertising in Product Features by implying unit included battery and charger. After receiving unit reread the advertisement and found that in Product Description it indicated longer life battery 'not included' but said nothing about the charger or regular battery. Bad marketeering.
2,lawyer,"The add is very misleading, under features they make you think you are gettin a light, charger and battery. Sorry I sent mine back."
3,flashlight broke,1st flashlight broke when i tilted the head. 2nd one they sent right out is working great
4,good cast and story,A Canadian film with an engrosing story and fine cast. Different action type film with more human interest than most on-the-run films.
5,"OUTSTANDING! Best listening, feel good memory songs ever!!!",Jim Nabors truly has done his listeners justice. This is a collection of some of the best songs that can take you back down memory lane and make you glad you went. I never get tired of hearing the songs on this CD. It seems to get better with every listening session. This is definately the Jim Nabors CD to add to your collection.
3,See Other Nabors Review,"Jim Nabors sings amazingly well, but is not a personal favorite. I bought the two cds for my wife, who likes him a lot. She loves the recording, and plays it a lot. Delivery was on time and in perfect condition."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITES!,"I have had this CD for awhile; I never get tired of listening to the selections of songs on this CD. If you like Jim, you will enjoy making a purchase of this one."
5,Critique of The Case of the Vanishing Fishhook,"I liked the book, The Case of the Vanishing Fishhook, because it was funny. One of the funniest parts of this book was when Hank, the cowdog, ate the soap. Hank had swallowed a fishhook. Then he swallowed soap to help him spit the hook out. This is the funniest ""Hank"" book written by John R. Erickson. I give this book a five-star rating and I recommend that you read it immediately!"
2,"Cheap, not worth the $",This doll is small and very cheap. Not worth more than $5. However my 1 year old enjoys putting the hat on and off- it is close to falling apart though
2,"More than 50% is Maltodextrin -- That's ""Pure""?","I should have read the reviewers' comments before making this purchase. When the label states ""Pure Vanilla Powder"", to me that means just that. Nope. As you will see after your purchase when you look at the jar, it has 2 ingredients. The first is Maltodextrin, and the second is Vanilla Bean Extractives. It tastes very good but you have to use a fair amount since it's been cut rather severely. The manufactures of this product should be honest and indicate that Maltodextrin is the primary ingredient."
5,Nielsen-Massey Vanilla Powder from Amazon,Love it! I mix my own hot drink mix and needed vanilla in a dry form and this works great.Use the same amount of Nielsen-Massey Vanilla as the recipe calls for in vanilla liquid form. Just Google for a Chai Tea mix and use this for your vanilla flavoring in the recipe. Delicious!! Also I use Splenda instead of sugar to mix this.
3,usually good,this is the 3rdt time using this product. the 2 times before no issues. this time it just solid up on me. have to stab and drill it with a knife to use. it is usually a good product. good vanilla flavor. I like it becasue i can use in recipes just like the liquid stuff (except add it to the dry instead of the wet). I can also use it in my coffee or tea or hot chocolate- it disolves wonderfully! I can also use it in baking mixes as gifts (so the recipient does not have to add vanilla).
3,"Good, but not as strong as I wanted","I wanted something similar to the vanilla powder that they have in coffee shops for my morning coffee.This powder does taste and smell like vanilla, but doesn't seem to have a strong flavor. Maybe the coffee shop powder uses artificial flavoring to make it more intense? Or maybe this one is 'watered down' too much with maltodextrin?In any case, it's not bad, but still not quite what I'm looking for."
3,Entertaining,"A better love story, however, could probably be told by any number of faceless lesbian/gay couples living across America and facing their daily challanges with mutual love, acceptance and support. The relationship of Bob and Rob unfortunately came across as one that was competitive, self directed and controling. One really does get the feeling that they were not ready for the daily trials of total commitment.Nevertheless, they emerge as thouroughly likeable young men, and one has to respect their courage in making a public statement of their relationship given that as public figures they had much to lose. In addition, the amount of energy and time they have devoted to the gay youth isseue is to be commended.I liked the book, I liked the authors. It just didn't seem much like a love story."
5,Shelter from the Storm,"I am an avid backpacker and typically use much smaller tents. However, I recently used a Titan for 5 days at a music festival. While the first three days were sunny and warm, the 4th and 5th days brought rain and micro-burst wind conditions with gusts over 60 mph. Winds coming straight down that caused the tent to pump up and down like a bellows. The word 'scary' comes immediately to mind but the tent and all contents came through dry and without damage. The corner guy-out points are the key!!! Use nylon cord and take advantage of these above-ground points to anchor and stabilize this tent and you cannot go wrong. All around us, awnings were being ripped off of very expensive RV's and lesser quality tents turned into big kites. Thanks Eureka! for making a very tough and dry tent!"
3,Slight let down,"This is my second Eureka product. I also have a northern breeze screen room with no complaints. Based on that product, I think this tent is good with handling bad weather. The problems I have come across is in the set up and the quaility of the poles. The instuctions such as they are said look for yellow on the spider hub but there was none. It is easy enough to figure out so I proceeded to hook up the poles. I thought they sent me the wrong ones. I got it all set up and the tension on the poles exceptionally strong. I took it down and took the tent camping. It went up easier but upon tear down, I noticed that two of the poles had about a 15 degree bend in them. I have set up the tent twice and am no wondering if it will last a whole year or not"
1,Terrible!!! Stay away,"If I could rate this zero stars I would.We bought this tent a few yrs. ago brand spanking new & checked it out in the yard. Then packed it back in the box. Life got in the way & we have not been able to go camping for a couple years. Well long story short, my son wanted to set it up July 4 weekend so we got it out. The primary metal coupling at the very top cracked clean apart! This rendered the entire tent completely useless as there was too much stress on the other poles & another was about to snap. $350.00 gone & now no warranty & no tent. what a waste of money buying this. NEVER again will I purchase a Eureka tent for any price. Ever."
1,I have a different perspective than the previous reviewer,"After having ACTUALLY used this tent, my view is somewhat different. Set up is almost comical, even with three experienced campers, and no matter how hard you stake it down, in any wind over 25mph this thing becomes an airborne, rolling blob that is a menace to other campers and to your gear trapped inside. I think you have to pay to have Consumer Reports test your products so I wouldn't beleive them, I doubt if they really tested the tent beyond setting up and scratching their chins awhile. I sure am not impressed and I intend to take full advantage of the no-questions-asked return policy where I bought it. Look around, there are better large tents our there!"
5,a master piece!,"I was introduced to classical music by a friend in the early 80's and before that i did not like classical music at all. Then, one day, this friend play an LP of Waldo de los Rios and when i heard a Song of Joy, i got hooked to classical music for ever!Now, 20 years later after that incident, I want to thank my friend for such wonderful gift and that was in part for the beautiful arrangements of what i thought it was tedious to listen to.This wonderful compilation of classical and non-classical music is indeed a beautiful gift for all kind of people who really wants to enjoy alone or with company!"
4,Great Shows,"The Gigantor shows included in this edition are complete and very good. The DVD is practically impossible to copy, even for fair use (?) The set is authored badly, apparently, and that's why it's practically impossible to copy. One of my DVD players had trouble with a few episodes."
5,gigantor,"i have been trying to reaquire these for the longest Gigantor was among my most favorite shows on TV when i was growing up, i had both vols. previously but wound up selling them...now that i have a son i will definitely be holding on to them..i urge anyone that was a kid in the late 60's and early 70's to buy both volumes you won't be diappointed..this was a great show.."
5,Favorite of the cats,My cats aren't picky in the least. But every time I get a new bag of this food one attempts to tear it open and eat it right away! You'd think she was starving. It's good for them and last a fair while. Love it.
2,Pleased,I am very pleased with Blue Buffalo dry cat food. My cats just love it and I have noticed shiner coats and less shedding. I also seem not to be cleaning quite so much out of the litter box. I purchased this through Amazon.com. The ordering was very easy and delivery was timely.
5,Kitty is happy and so am I!,"I have a 5-year old female Ragdoll who is very prone to weight gain. She was at 22 pounds, which is overweight - even for her breed. I started her on this around 6 months ago, and she has lost 4 pounds and is generally healthier than she was before. And it's also keeping my small domestic shorthair in tip top shape. 5 stars all around!"
4,Alright,"I started using this cat food when Science Diet & Royal Canin raised their prices. My cat's quite picky but she likes this food.She hasn't actually lost any weight on this product (!!), unlike the other brands. But, she's maintained her weight for about a year now.My cat tends to throw up a lot and I've seen a noticeable decrease in vomiting since she started eating this stuff. I will note that the same isn't true for the other Blue Buffalo formulas!I would recommend."
4,Blue buffalo,"Cats absolutely love this food. We have three cats and they all run for the bowls at supper time. I gave it only four stars as for at least one cat, a sensitive stomach food may still be necessary."
5,LOVE this cat food,"This cat food is amazing! Our 3 year old cat used to get UTI's all the time and we couldn't figure out why. After hundreds of dollars spent at the vet, they recommended we switch to Blue Buffalo. About a week after we switched we noticed a difference in our cat. He had more energy and just seemed to be more content and comfortable. Fast forward 2 years later - no more UTI's and and he is healthy as can be!"
5,Perfect!!!,Replacement suction cups worked great!!! Best part was I did not have to purchase whole new dock for 30 bucks.
1,wow.what a shock this cd is bad,"this cd is really bad for a greatist hits cd.i bought this album for heaven,pretty in pink and the ghost in you.these songs are real masterpieces .when buying this album i thought the rest of the songs would be good also,man was i wrong.besides the three songs i just mentioned the only other good tracks are president gas and imitation of christ.i spend over 20 dollars for an album of 14 tracks with just 5 good tracks on it.what a waste of money.don't make the same mistake i did."
2,redfish magic,"Red fish did not strike this bait lure. It was fun to try but will not purchase it again for my red fish ""fishing""."
4,Great content but hard to read,"I used this book for a ""Distributed Computing"" college course that I taught in 1999. So I read it pretty thoroughly. Overall I can't find many errors, and I thought the range of content was excellent, very thorough. In some places she is more complete than Tanenbaum. But I had to really struggle with some of the writing. It just wasn't very clear. Her sentences tend to be very long and complex which obfuscates the meaning."
4,Four stars.,"Jean definately knows her content well, and she gets a little too excited at times.The content is very consise and detailed. However due to this, the book requires close attention while reading (so don't read this too late at night).I feel the other reviews on this book are rather harsh, and I must admit that the first few chapters tend to be badly written, but the rest are ok."
2,"Well intentioned, poorly executed","I have great respect for the author of this book, as she undoubtedly knows her stuff (hence two stars, not one), however, she would have been well advised to have employed an editor before the final draft was published. The intent of each section is lost in a fog of cross-referencing and over-explanation. Get this book if: a) It's a required text b) You're a genius with time to kill c) You're extremely patient and keen to learn d) If the latest edition has been substantially edited"
2,Concurrent Systems,"Althought the book is very thorough, the style of writing makes it very heavy going. I found it comparable to reading a book of train timetables, imformative but boring. the diagrams tend to be abstract in the extreme."
1,No More Sleepless Nights,This is the perfect cure for insomnia. Try reading more than 3 pages in a row and you'll be hearing the Sandman.
4,Robert Goulet,I had these songs on cassette tape and the machine ate it. I ordered it from Amazon and they could not find it. However they gave me a link to Hastings and I got it right away.
3,Great voice!!!!,I love Robert Goulet's voice! Most of the songs were great old favorites! My only negative comment is that on a couple of songs the orchestra was playing too loud!
4,16 most requested songs by Robert Goulet,"They weren't my favorite, but some were good I would have prefered the origional recordings and some different songs on the CD"
1,Robert Goulet 16 Most Requested Songs,"This might be good if I could hear it, but at the volume setting for all the other CD's that are playing, this CD is nearly inaudible."
3,GOOD GOULET,"Goulet has a rich baritone voice and the sixteen selections show how he managed to become such a superstar during a time of several other worthier singers. However, if you like Goulet, you'll love this collection, as it has sixteen very beautiful songs. I find Goulet's deliveries, however, rather dispassionate, and I don't think he tried to branch out and show the range he could have possibly had."
1,out of date information,This book was published in 1992 and I feel it does not contain necessary insights into workplace issues that are relevant today.
5,Delightful,"A truly delightful book about Italians, human behavior, history, travel, and gardening. The author paints a picture with her words, captures your imagination, and makes you chuckle at the unique Italian way of living. From buying land and building a house to sinister business deals, to marriage contracting, gardening fetes and disasters, this book will charm and delight you on many different levels. I enjoyed this book so much more than ""Under the Tuscan Sun."" This is truly a gem of a book."
2,poor non-stick,"After awhile the non-stick surface begins to flake off. Not acceptable, especially for the price.I would not purchase this brand again."
4,How to do everything with your GPS,Great book!A lot of great tips.A whole lot of useful information to get your GPS running at full speed ahead.
1,Kill me now please!,Like a wolf caught in a trap I wanted to chew my ears off when I heard this album. You can't be serious! How did this woman get a record contract?
5,Berndes SignoCast Classic 10-Qt Stock Pot,"Berndes is my favorite cooking pot because of the great coating and the nearly waterless cooking potential. I use less oil when I saute' veggies and seasonings, food cooks quickly, evenly, and fresher tasting. Because of the cost I purchased my entire set one item at a time and although I feel I paid a bit more purchasing that way, I am totally satisfied. The only con that I have noticed is that the rims of my pots show nicks from being used and stored inside each other. But, that has no effect on the ease of cooking and best of all, the ease of cleanup. Very often I just rinse with hot water and a paper towel before washing with soap. Easiest!"
3,Good collection of Christmas Songs Featuring Country Artists,"I bought this primarily for the Gene Autry version of ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and Lynn Anderson's version of ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"". Other good songs are of course ""Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer"" by Dr. Elmo, ""Frosty The Snowman"" featuring ""Willie Nelson, ""Mr & Mrs Santa Claus"" featuring George Jones and Merle Haggard's version of ""Santa Clause is Comin' to Town"". I don't personally care for ""Little Gray Donkey"" (Johnny Cash), or George Jones' version of Jingle Bells. I definitely don't like Lynn Anderson's version of ""Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree"" and David Allan Coe's version of ""Jingle Bell Rock"". These are better done by Brenda Lee and Bobby Helms respectively IMHO."
1,not as described,I received one box. Not a carton of boxes. One box. I could have bought that at Office Depot for less than half the cost. Very disgusted.
4,SANTA,"I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER AND WELL YOU KNOW WOMEN THEY WANT SOMETHING SEXY THAT'S WHAT i USE IT FOR IT'S NICE i WISH IT WERE A LITTLE BIGGER , BECAUSE SOME GIRLS R BUGGER THAN OTHERS , BUT I LIKE SHOULD BE CHEAPER THOUGH"
4,Great Holiday Novelty Item,"I purchased this item for my little sister for Christmas. About 15 years ago, my dad had a similar stocking that she used to climb inside of for Christmas. I thought it would be a great gift for both my sister and my dad. It was a HUGE hit with my family. It brought back so many memories. Fairly decent construction, though it is felt and rather thin (but it's not that bad). Great idea for the Family Christmas Celebration."
3,Good value but no Sony,"I took a gamble because of the low price. Once I received I found the picture quality is definitely on par with Sony/Toshiba, then I learned from customer service that it is made by the same company that makes Advent, which is the low end model. Feel a bit cheated but I guess I can't complain too loudly because of the low price and I knew the risk I took."
3,Picture tube buzz noticeable when volume low,"Great picture and features for the price, but I returned this set because the picture tube made a soft but constant buzzing noise when the set was on. It didn't seem to be a defect. In a quiet bedroom with the volume low or off I found the buzzing quite noticeable and distracting. My other sets (Sony and even Symphonic) make hardly any operational noises.If you're going to have the sound down low in a quiet room I'd think twice. In a noisier environment or if you'll always be listening at medium to high volumes this is a buy."
2,"no picture, out of the box","Received the Jensen 20"" today. Eventually got it all hooked up, but no picture. I'm the second reviewer to receive this set new with a bad picture tube. The sound worked, but it was rather muddy sounding. I gave it 2 stars because it looks good just sitting turned off. Don't waste your time on this."
5,"Sony's are good but,,,,,","They Don't Last!!! I've had this Jensen for three months now and it's perfect,I set the color and sound the first day and never felt the need to go back to fine tune it,picture and sound are GREAT!! If it only lasts two years I'll be happy and ahead some $500$ if I had bought another sony."
3,big compromise,"The Jensen Q2049J has a great picture, but the sound is lo-fi and difficult to understand at low volume, and annoying at high volume. The price is great (I paid 149.95, free shipping) and it has a lot of features, but the poor sound keeps it from being a good deal!"
3,"Great picture, What about warranty?","I've had my Q2749J for a couple months now. It seems to work great; the picture is clear, the sound works fine (although I use an external sound system). Since the first day, however, whenever there is a lot of white on the screen, the tube makes a weird grinding noise. I can't seem to find any warranty information and jensen.com is down at the moment. Of course watching tv at loud volume levels covers this noise up, but it doesn't seem to be a problem to ignore."
4,So far so good,"I used this belt on a 2004 Subaru Forester XS, paired with aDayco 5040353. The old belts were made by Mitsubishi and were slightly stiff with small cracks, so after 35,000 miles, they definitely needed to be changed out.The Dayco belt appears to be good quality and went on without a problem. I've noticed less whistling / chirping when the car is idling, so it was money well spent. We'll see how they hold up."
1,Very disappointed,"In purchasing this book I was looking for pragmatic exercises applicable to work teams in the U.K. Having read the book, and being an experienced and well respected trainer,I decided that there was little, if anything that would be acceptable to 'blue collar workers'. There is too much 'ivory tower theory' that would turn people off, rather than stimulating and inspiring them to become actively involved in either a training or team activity. For me it was a waste of money!"
4,Rosie's Best!,"This album is simpley the best of Rosie. Insted of being titeled ""16 Most Requestid Songs"" it should be calld "" The Best of Rosie."" It has so many of her hits like Come on a my house and Mamboe Italiano. I love Too Young, the violins are so beautiful. Buy this cd now!"
4,Good (not Perfect) Recordings of Clooney's Biggest Hits,"Rosemary Clooney's most recognizable standards are all here in one collection, which will appeal to novices and die hard fans alike.Strangely, the recordings don't sound as perfect as they could...perhaps remastering was called for...Even so, it's an enjoyable compilation sure to get your toe tapping and to leave you humming with a smile in memory of the great chanteuse!"
2,"This cd is one you can enjoy, but.......","This is a nice Rosemary Clooney cd. Most the songs on it come from the early part of her career. Some of her hits i reallly adore, but others i will need to ignore.Rosie has a nice voice. It is one that you will not get tired of hearing day after day. I just wish for this project that there had been more of her songs that i truly like and enjoy listening to. I know it's hard to please everyone so there will always be someone that will be unhappy regardless of how a cd is made.I Can Not Recommend This Cd"
3,Typical Rosemary,"I liked this album because it filled in a hole I was missing in 50's recordings and 'This Ole House' has always been a favourite of mine. If yhou only buy one Rosemary Clooney recording, this should probably be it. Of course it includes 'Hey There' which is a standard. She sounded good and she still does."
3,Rosemary Clooney,There are a few good songs that are different & upbeat. Most of the music is mellowdramatic and semi-slow. It was worth the money...Aloha
5,"Does what it says, reliably.","Not much to say here. I bought this item to replace the ""full"" cartridges on my 3M respirator. They work just like the original set, which is to say, great. I use them for VOCs, and they also offer light particulate filtering."
5,A Feisty Taste of History,"Marti Phillip's ""The Last Pirate"" is a must read for all who love a taste of history created by the story of colorful,""real"" characters. Ms. Phillip's has done her research. This tale of the era surrounding the War of 1812 when Louisiana was aided and abeted by pirates of the best (and worst)kind puts you right there in time and place. The author has painted a feisty heroine in Carly and--ah, that notorious Captain Wolfe--whew--that we all might have a man like him in our life. As a former resident of the area this story is about and one who loves history, I find that Ms. Phillip's gives the reader a perfect picture of the Creole society and happenings (though fictional in most part) are very believable. All in all, a wonderful read by someone who had given up on historical fiction. I will certainly follow this author through her next romp in history."
2,Nice product; doesn't fit.,"I bought this custom fit sun shield for our 97 land cruiser because I hate the one-size-fits-none products that they sell the local stores. While the product appears to be very well made and was a bargain for the price, it really doesn't fit that well. It's about 1.5 inches too tall and is very difficult to install each time. I'm also concerned that daily use will wear the headliner of the vehicle prematurely because of the friction required to wedge the shade behind the mirror. I gave the product 2 stars because it is actually very well made. If only it fit..."
5,Wonderful Product,This is a great book. There is a wide variety of recipes for all ages. The recipes that are suggested for older children are also great for adults. I bought one for myself and one for a friend (who also loves it) and I have recommended it over and over again to other mothers. It suggests great (easy) recipes and food combinations for babies that I wouldn't have thought of. So far it's a hit and I'm looking forward to trying more of the recipes.
4,Not as hard as it looks!,"This book is by a Cordon Bleu trained chef, and the illustrations look it. Gorgeous meals, but would I really cook this stuff? For the most part, yes. Most of the recipes are simple, though when the author whips out her food processor and grinds her own meat, I don't really think the typical busy mom will follow! There are some recipes with ingredients I don't pick up by habit at the market, but nothing that isn't readily available.Definitely buy this book for ""party food"", if you want gorgeous meals or snacks to tempt a toddler. It probably won't be your everyday cookbook, though."
4,"Beautiful pictures, sound advice, but how practical?","I have mixed feelings about this book. The advice about nutrition is heartfelt and sound, the pictures as in all books by this publisher are great, and I certainly got some wonderful ideas. However, I really wonder how many busy mothers of today (and that includes mothers at home, as I am) have time for many of the recipes and ideas in this book. When you have a young child ready for lunch, do you really have time to make them Chicken Sausage Snails that really look like snails, or Sleeping Cannelloni that look like little sleeping girls? I understand that some recipes would be for a special day, but so many of the recipes in this book are quite complex. And maybe that's fine---maybe I should be making more things like those! And I very well might try after being inspired by this book."
2,"I barely have time to shower, let alone make these recipes!","I am the mother of a 8 month old who insists on feeding himself. He won't use a spoon, only his hands, this book has recipes I would expect to find at a 5 star restaurant, but not in my kitchen. There are not many suggestions on easy to make, finger foods. Everything is very complex & really needs to be eaten with utensils. Yes this book is beautiful, but not realistic for me & my family."
1,What a waste,"My kids have always had a healthy diet, but like variety. This book had so much variety, it seemed perfect. I stuck to this book for 3 weeks. I have made 12 of these recipes, so I feel I have given the book MORE than a fair shot. The kids hate the food and the preparation times take far longer than the guidelines suggest. Also, the recipes use many perishable ingredients in small amounts, so there is a lot wasted. My grocery bill went up and no one would even touch the food."
4,Good could be imrpoved,The recipes are very good and the information is also excellant (I would check with your peditrician about possible food allergies on some recipes). However the book could use an easier format and more pictures.
2,Not realistic,"This book flies in the face of most of the literature I've read about when to introduce foods to new eaters. It also is unrealistic, in my opinion. Not many moms will have time to cook like this for their baby.Maybe check it out from a library or flip through it on a store shelf before you decide to purchase, to see if it's right for you."
2,Cute but useless.,"I loved the pictures in this book. I loved leafing through it and admiring all the hard work at presentation the photographer and author had obviously done in their dainty animal face pizzas and artistic food presentation. I hope their babies appreciated it. Mine doesnt give a hoot if his cheese looks like a star or a cow or a rocket or if I put little olive eyes on his smiling pizza face. Frankly, who has the time for this!I did find some nice recomendations in the infant feeding section on how to mix different veggies in purees and but most of the recipes had me going "" who in the world is going to sit around doing that!"" Kudos on the pretty pictures but if you are a harried mom trying to get food on the table for a screaming toddler, pass this one on."
2,If you're already a gourmet cook...,"This cookbook has lots of neat ideas for meals and makes everything look delicious and appealing. However, if you are not the worlds greatest cook, you will have trouble tackling these recipes, especially in any reasonable amount of time. I am hoping to cook well for my kids, but not when it forces me to leave them screaming for an hour or more while I dice and chop and saute and fry, etc. Added to that some very unusual ingredients and this book is clearly not for the basic cook or the cook on a budget. Still, the pictures are appealing."
5,"A great, easy baby food book",I bought this for my daughter who makes most of my 7-month old granddaughter's food. She said there were ideas and combinations in the book that she never would have throught of. She feels it helps her with a diverse menu and good nutrition.
5,Love this book!,I use this book almost everyday. The recipes are easy and yummy. I didn't want to give my daughter canned baby food and these recipies are easy and you can freeze them. I highly recommend this book.
2,not good for picky eaters,"I bought this book when my son was 18 months old. He is now 3 1/2 years old and has never even wanted to try any of the recipes I made using this book. The recipes are complicated and time consuming (not what you want when you are trying to look after a toddler) and too full of undisguised ""weird"" ingredients that fussy eaters won't even touch. I think it would only be useful for parents whose children are non-picky eaters from the start."
5,Love,Very informative. Very useful information that is important for the well being of any child. I would and have recommended this book.
2,"Ehhh, pretty unimaginative","I am a very good cook, but I have been stuck when trying to create tasty meals for my little monkey. I bought this book anticipating great ideas and tasty recipes. For one thing, the recipes are very boring and not hard to figure out for yourself, without a cookbook telling you; for instance fruit skewers, rolled up PBnJ.A couple of the recipes peaked my interest, the vegetable chips and veggie fritters...the recipes were horrible. They didn't come out the way the description explained they would. Everything I tried to make that was out of the ordinary turned out poorly. I assume these were not tested recipes."
4,Great variety for baby,"One of the most challenging questions of being a new parent is - what do I feed this little person? This book gives some great ideas for adding variety to your baby's diet. Some of the recipes are a little over-the-top and, let's face it, I'm sticking with store-bought baby food rather than making purees at home (who has the time?). But when you have a baby that eats like a bottomless pit (like my 9-month-old) there are some great recipes that are appetizing and well-balanced. It's a great help when you want to make sure your baby is getting everything he/she needs in their diet."
4,YUM!,"I have this book for when my 3 month old is ready to start solids, although I have 2 older children I have experienced feeding with already. After reading through I found it very informative. However, it does not give as many recipes for the the beginning stages as I would have liked. Nor do I think I will actually use any of those listed for the toddler stages as they are too labor intensive. Still it is nice to know there are alternatives to the jar on the shelves at your local grocery store!"
4,Everything has tasted good!,"I've made several of the recipes for my 10 month old. He has liked every one of them. They aren't too difficult to make, and the ingredients are simple. I can go to the store without a list, and generally remember what I need to get for a recipe."
3,"OK, but not practical for picky eaters","The ideas in here were interesting and creative..but my kids have been willing to eat about 10% of the recipes I've made. They also aren't for people short on time. I have triplets and some of the recipes take more time than I have. If you have kids that want to try lots of things, and you have lots of time it's a great book..but for me it's something I pick up when I actually have some extra time - not every day."
2,"Nice Photography, Bland recipes","Sorry Annabel...nice pictures in this book, some fun shapes and interesting combos, but the ingredients!! Oh my! What child likes to eat smoked salmon and shallots? I have tried out 3 recipes for my 16 month old (and he is not a picky eater yet) and he spit them out and gave me a look like I was nuts! I bought this book for some fresh meal ideas. The animal shapes are fun and all but for a child who needs his food cut into bite sized shapes - whats the point? Perhaps this book is better suited to older toddlers who are a bit more finicky about their food?"
4,Looking for something different,"I was looking to add some variety to my 15 month old daughters meals. This cookbook definitely helps with mixing things up and providing healthy meals. I do not have a lot of time in the kitchen but I also do not want to take the easy route and utilize canned goods and prepared meals with tons of sodium. I find the recipes and instructions easy to follow and most times, generally, quick to prepare with a little pre-planning. My daughter definitely approves too - she has not refused one recipe and we have tried almost all from the appropriate sections!"
5,Both helpful and fun,"My sister had this book for her children, and liked it so much that my mom got it for me right before I had my son. I absolutely hate to cook but I find these recipes easy and fun to make. I never thought I'd be making my own baby food in a million years, but this book is a big help. Also note that the recipes for older children can be made for the whole family, and they're very appetizing.Many of the meals, especially the sauces, are suitable for freezing, so the criticism that the meals are too elaborate is not justified, in my opinion. You can prepare one batch and divide it up for freezing. You don't have to create the faces, etc., if you don't want to, but for those of us who are less than inspired or creative in making meals, the ideas are great."
4,"Great book, recipes take some effort but worth it","I looked quite a bit for a kids cookbook and was very happy with this one. It is true that you probably wouldn't have parsnips laying around, but if you want to change up what your kid eats and provide some variety there are some good recipes here. I have found that the prep and cooking isn't terribly involved, but some of the assembly is, which I why I just make chicken sausage but neglect to make them into cutesy ""chicken sausage snails."" If you can get away with not making your kid's food not look like shapes or animals, you recover some time. Also, make double or triple batches and freeze the food, which comes in really handy later...better than chicken nuggets or ordering pizza."
3,A little elaborate but too early to tell,"I have two baby food books by Karmel and I'm starting to wonder why I even bought one. Pretty simple to make baby food purees and as far as combinations, I've found that I just tend to combine vegetables or fruits that I would normally prepare together for a grownup and just blend it instead. Duh. I do add cinnamon to apples and pears, which I probably wouldn't have thought to do without the books but otherwise, so far it's not rocket science. Pretty pictures, though, which helped inspire me to go the home-made route. And as far as the bigger kid foods, I'm hoping some of those recipes will come in handy down the road."
5,Best of the bunch.,"I bought several books in anticipation of preparing my son's meals versus relying on the jarred varieties. This book was the best of the bunch. Easy to follow, practical tips and advice, exciting recipes... even a day-by-day menu in the back to help plan meals!... I highly recommend this book!"
3,Annabel Karmel isn't very wary of berries... ; ),"I love almost everything about this book. From the photos to the detailed directions it's an amazingly helpful book. However, many American doctors disagree with her choice of first foods for babies. For example -- should broccoli be a first-stage food? Should strawberries be given to a six-month-old? Should you really be giving cow's milk so early? All the advice I've been given tells me to be much more cautious about many of these highly allergenic foods. But if you've done your research and asked your pediatrician's advice, the recipes and information in this book are EXTREMELY helpful! I would still recommend this book to all of my friends!"
5,Wonderful book,"I loved this book. It has beautiful pictures and easy to follow instructions. It also contains valuable information that other books leave out, such as which recipes are suitable for freezing, how to modify recipes with different ingredients, and how long to store foods in the refrigerator and freezer.The meals are delicious (I've tried them) and easy to make. They do call for some ingredients that are probably more mainstream in England (where the author is from), such as parsnips and rutabega, but I've either been able to find the ingredients or just left them out.I agree with one reviewer, that once your child is starting to eat regular table foods, this book might be overkill. But it's wonderful up to about 10 months or so. To address some other reviews -- if you're looking for a book that tells you to ""steam carrots in the microwave with a little water then mash them with a fork,"" why do you need a cookbook?"
2,Disappointed,I order this book and I am very disappointed. I don't considered using vegetable oil or frying anything healthy. Also the recipes are time consuming. The pictures are nice and all of the shapes they make out of the food but lacking substance.
1,Not worth it,I wouldn't buy this book if your child is past the pureed baby food stage. Much of the book is dedicated to that stage and the recipes for older babies and toddlers just aren't enough to make it worth the money.
2,First Meals,"The book is quite colorful and offers a variety of options and suggestions, but I feel the recipes for toddlers are too complicated and time consuming, even for a stay at home mom. I do feel the recipes geared toward infants were great.What I did gain from the book was not to be afraid to introduce my child to a variety of foods, whether I like them or not. Exposing their palates to endless possibilities, at a young age, could perhaps deter the picky eater syndrome. Also, the additional information regarding your childs diet and the resources listed in the back is quite valuable information.With all that being said, I would still not make a recommendation to purchase this book if you're truly looking for recipes for your toddler."
2,This book could have been better,"I bought this book so I could feed my baby healthy meals without resorting to canned baby foods. Unfortunately the recipes focused too much on presentation. My baby has allergies to milk and eggs,so some of the recipes I could not use.I also feel some of the suggestions were unsafe when it came to giving your child certain foods at certain stages due to serious choking hazards. But I did find the daily meal planner to be helpful in the back of the book."
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros: Great photos. Great descriptions of what tools you need. Good serving and storage suggestions. For younger babies, she gives a great variety/mix of foods. I like how it was written out in sections.Cons: Time consuming when you get to the older baby/toddler section. Lots of different ingredients I wouldn't buy or use in my own adult recipes (I just had to remind myself she ia a gourmet cook by trade). Not good for picky eaters. But I guess if you fed your baby all the recipes she suggests, then maybe your baby wouldn't grow to be a finicky toddler.?"
1,A REAL waste,"I agree with ""A reader from Boston"" for the same reasons. Ms. Karmel is living in a fantasy world. My kid eats fruits, vegetables, and grains, but she won't touch this stuff. She's just over two years old and she won't come near the stuff Karmel expects a one-year old to eat. I was pretty dubious about it just reading the recipes but gave them a try. So anyone who wants my copy cheap please drop me a line."
5,A book parents cannot live without!,"This is a great book. We have used this heavily and have NEVER bought prepackaged, odd-colored, jarred or other food for our child. Get this book and make the food. It is easy. Your baby will thrive."
1,Don't buy this book!!!,"I try some of the receipts for my twins. They don't like it. I know that you should not feed baby under 12 months, leeks, onion, heavy butter cooking. If you follow the book, your baby may endup with choking hazard. Please watch out. Don't buy this book. The receipt is not good for the baby. They are not suppose to eat those food."
2,Wasn't impressed,"I didn't love this book. For someone that hates to cook- this has you very busy. Maybe it was partly my fault- the description didn't say they were ""easy meals"" but I guess I just expected them to be a lot less involved. One could use these recipes to make dinner for the whole family- they are not just Toddler meals. I tried some and my toddler did not like anything (but I think that is just my toddler- not necessarily the book). :) Lucky me!"
2,Too Fancy for Lil Ole Me,"This book is beautiful, but I'm not going to go out and buy a bunch of stuff I don't normally eat (like leeks) to feed my baby. I think this might be better for me if I, 1. I wasn't looking for specific age appropriate feeding information and 2. if I was a much more ambitious cook."
4,Great recipes,"I purchased ""First Meals"" when my son made the switch from purees to table foods. We had already been given ""Top 101 Baby Purees"" as a gift and had great success with many of the recipes. I was somewhat disappointed that the puree section of ""First Meals"" had many of the same recipes as the other book, but as we were not using those recipes anymore, it didn't make much difference. My son can be a somewhat picky eater, so I was anxious to find some foods that he would enjoy. I am very pleased to say that of the handful of recipes we have tried, he has enjoyed every single one. I find that the meals are easy to make and many are easy to freeze so that excess can be saved for later."
5,Great Tool for Feeding Babies & Kids,"I haven't had an opportunity to use the recipes in this book yet but I love the informational sections of the book that discuss picky eaters, when to start feeding your baby solid foods, what types of nutrients your babies and kids need to stay healthy and the like. This book is broken into sections that range from the first foods offered to babies starting the foray into solid foods to kids ages 3 to 7. With recipes that are nutritious and have visual appeal, you'll be able to find something to satisfy even the toughest food critics in the house."
5,Easy and delicious recipes,"This is a great book full of information and recipes. They are easily modified recipes also. For the meat-based protein recipes, I suggest adding a fruit. I made the chicken casserole and added pears or applesauce to help tone down the stronger flavor. My son loved it. I also add pastina to add texture."
1,you get what you pay for,I bought this watering can 2 years ago. The first year the plastic nozzle broke off. The second year the side of the can cracked.
3,Disappointing despite some fine moments,"Stuart is an acclaimed poet,so one was expecting something really special from this story collection. Sad to say, the book doesn't live up to Stuart's reputation. The stories essentially build up to nothing, no surprises or revelations, no delight or inventiveness. The title story and ""Mr. Mann"" are perhaps best. Lucy is an interesting character, one who seems to inhabit a world of her own. Too bad she, nor the boy Mark, who figures in the majority of stories, has been more fully developed."
3,"Great Show, Lousy Discs","I don't get showtime, so I've been relying on the DVD versions to get my QAF fix. The show gets a bit preachy and repetitive in some episodes, but the character development is great. However, the discs I got with this set were terrible, and I've talked with a few other friends who also have season two, and their comments were, ""I thought it was just me."" The disc will freeze up while you are viewing an episode, and you have to go back to the menu and go into the scene selection area to get back. Sometimes the scene selection menu will freeze up, and you have to start the process all over. It took me 2.5 hours to watch one episode, which is almost enough to make me not want to see season 3. Almost."
4,straight mom fan,"I just ordered the Second Season of QAF. I can't wait for it to arrive. When they first started airing QAF on Logo, I was instantly hooked. Here was a drama with realistic humor, poignancy and actual intelligence . I'd missed most of the First Season,due to guilt about being a straight woman watching it. (""I'm straight--so what am I thinking?!""--but now I know I'm not the only one) I ordered it anyway. It is awesome. I too do not like all the graphic sex--and some of the boring plot-lines so I simply press the FF button on the remote. The message is generally an uplifting one. My QAF DVDs have become my late-night indulgence when I know it's safe from the kids' viewing. I love Brian and Justin-they steal every scene. -Pretty brave acting if you ask me."
5,A must get DVD set for all household,"This is another amazing season of queer as folk. I love every mintue of veiwng and the extras on the 6th dvd are great. I must say i have fallen in love with each charachter in different ways, and i will be watching the episodes over and over again. I think everything about the show is top quailty and the actors and the writers have done an great job once again. I hope season 3 is as good as season 1 & 2 and i will be watching when it comes to tv here down under in australia.In this season I laughed, cried and watched in excitment what will happen next. My favorite characters are brian and michael, wo are both great actors and eye candy (lol), also debbie makes me laugh alot."
5,great,"dvds were in great conditons, packaging was in great conditions, love the show so much, the dvds never skipped at all"
5,Excellent Show.... excellent season!,"My husband and I started watching this show on Showtime out of curiosity and we were instantly hooked. We never missed an episode and miss it terribly since it stopped airing. The characters are intoxicating (there is SOMETHING about Brian Kinney- SO HOT!). Season 2 is a highlight of the 5 season program, which we are rapidly acquiring on DVD. The Brian/ Justin dynamic is excellent. QAF is a groundbreaking, sexy, and intensely addictive. I highly recommend this show. Its Sex and The City, only with hot gay guys! Fantastic."
4,Falls a little short of season one.,"Queer as folk, is the best show on TV nowadays. Season two is still fresh and still a great show but it doesn't have the same feel as season one. I feel for Justin the most because I am a 19 year old gay male. I think I've been in almost all of his situations from his parents, to an older romance. I think this show does show how for the most part how the gay & lesbian community is. The downside to season two is that they solve things to easily, it seems like they start a new juicy story and it ends at the end of the episode. Unlike season one where all the stories seem to come together and take a little while until they were commpletely sloved. Season three has the same problem. The show still rocks and is still great."
4,Lost in Transit???,"I have been asked to do a review of the product but it hasn't even arrived yet. I am sure it will be good - if it ever does arrive!Interestingly, I wasn't asked to do a review on my purchase prior to this - which, incidentaqlly, also hasn't arrived as yet!"
3,International deliverytime - too long,The international deliverytime takes to much time. Up to 5 weeks until receiving.
3,Lost It's Way and thank God Michael isn't as whiney,Loved Season One but it was based on the UK series. This season started well but after about 3 episodes it just lost its way and the stories floundered looking for meaning. Do the Brits have to do another series to give the writers here something to fiddle with to create a good show?. Despite the storylines being variable the characters themselves grew and grew and for this my friends and I continued to watch. It is a shame that a show (season1) we couldn't miss has now become something that we don't care about and are not at all interested in the fact there is a 3rd season completed and a 4th either being filmed as I type this or just about to be finished being filmed.
5,Queer is BACK!,Being one of the unfortunent millions lacking Shotime and the ability to pay for cable. I had to wait until it came out on DVD and OH MY GOD. The DVD sound and picture quality rocks. There is an entire disc with just bonus features. And although the first season will remain forever on its throne the second season gets to sit at the right hand. I'm supposing that if you're buying it you've already seen the first season or the second of TV so there's no plot synopisis suffice to say that you will laugh cry and scream curses at the screen when you see the... well you get the idea.btw ...
4,"Not as good as Season One,but....","Not horrible,either! Yes,there are glaring inconsistancies between the two seasons and some of the plotlines seem silly and farfetched,but Season Two still offers top notch acting(Gale Harold and Randy Harrison shine in the first few episodes,and i'm not a B/J fan),Great Music and eye candy as far as the eye can see.There are some wonderful surprises,Mikey and his mom both find new loves,Ted starts an...interesting new business venture and much more!If you ignore the problems(sometimes clunky writing and direction)and just watch,Season Two will certainly entertain!"
5,I LOVE QUEER AS FOLK!,"I don't care what any one says, season two was just as good as the season one. It was just too short. They had 22 episodes the first time around, 20 the second season and now they only want to have 16 for seasons three and four. I can't get enough of this show. I can't wait for season three!"
5,Queer As Folk Second Season,This set is much better than season one. There are more features and the music is incredible. If your a big fan this is a must have.
5,OUTSTANDING - A COLLECTORS ITEM - A MUST BUY!!,EXCELLENT SHOW - EXCELLENT QUALITY DVD's - A real collectors item - a must for Gay and Straight alike!
5,Dry But Factual,"This book is a little dry for a layman's tastes probably, but more than likely only the interested will purchase such a specialized title anyway. The reason for the ""dryness""? This book is very conservative, making no convoluted deductions from the evidence, but is actually a concise survey of everything currently known about the mycenaeans (what types of info are preserved on the tablets, what crops and livestock were cultivated, what aspects of the administrative system is known, etc.). The writing style isn't dry, really, just to-the-point as it should be in such a work. Any deep studies of bronze-age Greece should start here."
1,Not so good,"Most of the book is ancient thesis and known hypotesis. Not so impressed, expected much more from author.Even the graphics are waek."
4,A man who falls in love with his own daughter.,"This story is vey interesting and unbelievable. It's about a man name Jess who was separated from his own daughter when she was just a baby. After many years have past, they both met each other by his house having a conversation. Jess fell in love with her without knowing that she's his own daughter, and goes for her. I rate this boo an ""8"" because of it's uncommon story that can never be accepted in our society."
2,If you like 'em with schmaltz . . .,"I've only listened to a few tracks before storing in my to-listen-to-later stack. P.P. is a borderline case for me, but I like Tennessee Waltz. What we have here sounds like an overdone re-recording of 50s and 60s hits--heavy on the violins, choruses, and other syrupy forms of overproducing. Do I detect the heavy hand of Mitch Miller ladling on the schmaltz? Reminds me of the way the fun Sons of the Pioneers were sugared o'er in their later years."
3,Not the Best,"I must admit I've never been a fan of Patti's. She certainly has an acceptable voice, but she sings so artificially. Even her ""look"" on the jacket of this CD is artificial.Anyway, I see little of the substance of a great singer such as Eydie Gorme or, one of my favorites (I'm a WW II guy), Helen Forrest."
1,how mundane...,"She doesn't have the gift of understanding lyrics, she never should have ever stepped in front of a mic, we've got the bozo evil-genious Mitch miller to thank for discovering her... Not even good as a cmpy singer, this is just plain bad singing, that's not even good enough to be considere ""so bad it's good"". It's bad..."
4,Patti Page - 16 Most Requested Song,I heard it for the first time last night at a friends house and that's why I'm here today to purchase it. It was really good!
5,The Everything Kids Science Experiments Book,"This has to be one of the best purchases i have ever made for my 13 year old grandson. Wish i could have found this book years ago we would have had used several science experiments in this book already. The instructions are so simple and complete. We will be using this for many science projects to come.Laurie RiseYamhill, OR."
4,Good for school,I am a science teacher in Brazil and I just received the book. It has a lot of good and simple experiences that you can do with the students at achool if you have few resources.
4,easy to use,Has easy to do experiments. A bit too easy for my kids but for younger children it would be a good book. Perhaps 9 and under.
3,A Fairly Good Introduction for Naive Children,"This is not for kids who have a strong background in science, but it may serve to interest some into learning more. The author's explanation of some of the experiments are not accurate, and some need more cautionary warnings to keep them from harming themselves. One experiment, the one involving dropping ice into boiling water, had the dubious distinction of combining both of the problems."
3,science book,Bought this last year dont know why im revewing this nowif your kids like science go buy it for them
2,Good for 10-8,"It came on time but I expected it to be for an older kid, a little more advanced. I can give it to the younger grandkids."
4,Class Library,I purchased this for my son's 4th grade science class for the class library and was very pleased that it was offered with library binding. I always like to contribute to our schools and often look for books that will have a longer shelf life so this one fit the bill in so many ways...the experiments are very varied and the book is colorful and interesting and the children can choose their own experiments to try with simple items.
4,Nice Starting Point for Your Young Scientist,"We recently started doing some experiments out of the book, and my daughter is really enjoying them. She is asking me to do one every day. The book includes experiments from a wide array of disciplines. You will enjoy seeing your kids learn when you are doing the experiments out of this book."
4,Great book!,This is a great book for parents to keep kids entertained and have a good time. The experiments also teach kids in a fun way. Perfect for a rainy or snowy day!
4,Bored on a Sunday Afternoon?,When we are bored we pick up this book. The experiments are fun and fairly simple to complete. It is a great way to spend an afternoon together and everyone will learn something new.
4,The Everything Kids' Science Experiments Book,The Everything Kids' Science Experiments Book is an ideal book for older school age children for Science projects. The experiments offer a detailed investigation into each concept being explored by children. Many of the experiments do require adult supervision due to the complexity of some of the experiments that require multiple steps. It is most suitable for middle school and early high school students. Additional facts related to the concept being explored are mentioned to peak the science student's interest in the topic. The experiments require moderate to extensive planning by teachers or parents while supporting the young learner.
3,Ok book but not as simple as expected,"I was expecting easy experiments, but had to buy some stuff to do most of them. Can be more fun, as it is for very little kids"
4,Perfect for science introduction,"Perfect for science introduction. It contains quite a few fun experiments, easy to assemble at home, from wide range of disciplines. We use some of them for science expo at my daughter elementary school. It is good for kindergardeners through 5-th graders.The look is pretty poor, but other than that we can not complain."
5,Memorable Characters,"Lady Delacour is by far the most intriguing character in this novel but Belinda and the two male leads, (Mr. Hervey and Mr. Vincent) can carry their own. This is a wonderful novel filled with a few surprises and mystery. For instance - who is the captive Virginia, what is her story, and how does she figure into Belinda's future? The book is highly readable and you won't want to put it down in order to find out who will end up with who and what will become of the enigmatic Lady Delacour. Typical themes of the times - sexism, colonialism, etc are woven throughout the beautiful prose. Highly recommended!"
5,If you love Austen or Burney . . .,"As I long time fan of Jane Austen, I became interested in the authors she may have read. Belinda was a nice introduction to the more affluent society of eighteenth and early nineteenth century Great Britain. Maria Edgeworth's characters are believable and engrossing."
2,no Jane Austen...,"I read the book based on reader recommendations that equated 'Belinda' with Jane Austen's work. I had high expectations but struggled to read the book to the end. I found the writing at certain points more like an essay than a novel. Her character development seems forced, and there is little ambient description. Those interested in tracing literary associations of Jane Austen should probably read the book, but if you've read all of Austen's work and are desperately looking for something 'similar' to her style and quality, I would recommend you look elsewhere."
3,built good,"All in all it is good, I didn't get any instructions but I finally figured it out. The size is to small for my two cocatiels but for a couple of small birds it would be great. I love the ease of being able to roll the cage outside and move to vaccum. It is a great set, but I needed bigger"
3,Parakeet cage,"Products was ok, although there were no instructions at all to put it together. Some of the pieces don't fit together properly and it makes the cage a bit lop sided. But it does keep the birds in."
5,Fun book that keeps their interest!,"After getting this at my local library for the second time, I decided to buy my own copy. It's the most requested story by my three year old and when he took it to story time at the school last week, the teacher and other kids in the class loved it! Nobody knew what a wombat was before that! I think all kids will enjoy this one. Great for further discussions on other animals that live in Australia."
4,yeah it's pretty good,"hey i recently looked it up that this stuff has creatine in it, and i that's why it's so cheap because it's a cheap powder, it still does the job you will get bigger!!! but! it's less of a protein shake than a weight gainer shake...this is for those who train all day everyday..."
2,Don't Bother,"This book sounded very interesting when I read the reviews. However, there's not a lot of substance once you get into it. Dozens of women are profiled (Ms. Hanson's 85 Broads) in a very superficial way. I didn't find much of anything new or interesting in any of the profiles. The jacket blurb for this book is overwritten and the book fails to deliver what's promised. Don't bother."
5,Perfect,Even heat distribution allows for everything from sauteeing to reheatingof foods and the position of the two handles does not interfere with use on the stove ... easy clean-up and light weight are also a plus.
4,Jammin' Video,"I believe that, even though the quality of the concert video is dated (1974), it is still very entertaining. I don't know how you can watch this video and not get into the groove of the music. The band (particularly the horn section)really steals the show, and the music and entertainment on the stage and in the audience makes you want to get up and dance."
1,KC and The Sunshine Band In Concert 1974,"It's always hard buying Live concerts,The picture quality on this disc is ok but the sound quality is terrible, sometimes you just got to take pot luck rather than rely on someones elses review. I did read some of the reviews and I don't think I'm being to harsh. It doesn't do KC justice sorry.The service from the supplier of the disc was very good so no problems there. It's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll, especially if you live downunder."
1,"POOR, POOR, POOR",Visual is extremely poor and the audio is worse. Save your money! Couldn't watch the whole thing due to the pain that this pathetic video inflicted.
2,Go with Cisco Press,"I recently took and passed my CCNA, with little help from this book. Had I only studied this book, I do not think I would have passed. After reading and studying this book for a month, I was given a Cisco Press book, and I found I didn't know half of what I needed to. There are MANY things missing from this book, and they are constantly contradicting themselves. Very poor quality book. If you're studying for a Cisco test, buy a Cisco Press product. The Cisco Press book was much more clearly written, and there were few times in reading it that I was confused."
4,Good Study Guide,"This book is decent- like the other reviewers it is not perfect, but it does have its value. My recommendation is to buy a few books to get ready for the exam- including this one."
1,Awful,Everything about this game is awful when i saw that there was a health & fitness club tycoon i was excited i thought it would be something new and something that no other tycoon game as done yet is make it so you can control a gym well i bought the game and the first mission is impossible to pass unless you cheat i have no idea why like the person that reviewed the game before me he had to cheat then the levels after that it was managable so he was down pat on that....the staff also dont help you unless you tell them who you want them to help...this is one of the worse would go with Mall Of America Tycoon as one of the worse....graphics are awful and blurry as well....every aspect of the game is awful...and there sure as heck could of given us more gym equipment people that made this game should goto a gold's gym to see what they are missing....
2,Room for improvement,"I was looking for an exciting tycoon game in fitness and I found this one. I'd have to say I was a bit disapointed in the game. The graphics are not that good. And you can't control any of the people or situations. The only thing you can do is buy a few things to open your gym and wait for participants to enter. And you can read their comments. But you cannot interact with them or anything else. It is also very difficult to upgrade your gym with the little bit of money you get in the beginning. Another thing I disliked was you cannot rotate objects to place in the gym or design it much. Anyway, at least the price was reasonable. After playing it, I could see why the price was so low. I do not recommend you buy this game, even if it only cost a dollar! This is the kind of game you would expect to see on a free online game site."
2,Too short,"Probably one of the worst tycoon games I've played. First of all it is way too short. There are only 6 ""scenarios"" in the game. You can't really do much with the characters. It does tell you what they are thinking and their stats, but you can't place them anywhere, send them anywhere etc. The staff quits most of the time, and don't really do anything. The characters also rarely ""work out"", they just walk around. Sometimes the players will stay stuck on the corner or against the wall. The amount of money you are given is nowhere near enough. You run out of it quickly and it takes an enormous amount of time to build it up.Probably the only cool thing about it is the machines. They are pretty realistic and theres a variety of them. But this is pretty much it.Overall, the game is too short and there are way more downs than ups. I don't recommend it."
2,Health and Fitness Club Tycoon,"I BOUGHT THIS GAME 2 DAYS AGO....AT FIRST I WAS LIKE COOL....THE FIRST WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE....THEN I GOT THE HANG OF IT....BUT IT DIDNT LAST LONG....I BEAT IT IN NO TIME....THERE ARE 6 MISSIONS....THATS IT....I BEAT IT WITH NO CHEATS....THE OPTIONS STUNK....NOT MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM....OR THEY COST TOO MUCH....HARDLY NO MONEY TO START....BUT I FIGURED A WAY TO CHEAT WITHOUT ENTERING ANY CHEAT CODES....BUT STILL WASNT WORTH IT....IT WAS LIKE IT WAS A DEMO INSTEAD....PLAY A FEW MISSIONS AND ITS DONE....NOT WORTH GETTING....AS FAR AS THE SIMS GO, THE OLD SIMS ARE NO GOOD ANYMORE, BUT THE NEW SIMS IS GREAT....READ MY REVIEW ON THE SIMS 2....ITS WORTH IT....THANK YOU AND PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS WAS HELPFUL...."
3,"laugh, laugh, then it's over","This is a charming little book of Jewish humor - and I emphasize ""little"" since it is really quite slender. Vorspan has some knowing fun with some ethnic stereotypes and he'll make you laugh hard now and again. It would have been nice if the book were a bit more fleshed out."
5,Tales of Long Ago African Hunting,"I am a hunter and have hunted in Africa. I have read much of the African hunting literature by Capstick, Ruark, Boddington and others. This is my perspective. From that perspective, the book was a wonderful and enjoyable read.The book is in reality two parts (two-thirds and one-third). The first part is a series of tales and adventures, starting with tales of elephant hunting, then lion hunting and then others. This has the feel of sitting around a campfire with the author, listening to tales of long ago, days that no longer exist where parts of Africa were overrun with rhinos and lions.The second part is more information, such as caliber selection. This section is also interesting but obviously some of the information is outdated. For a reader interested in this information, a more modern writer such as Craig Boddington would be better.All in all, the book is a good read that I did not want to put down."
3,Not as good as first book,"I bought this book because I really enjoyed ""Hunter"" by John Hunter. This book was entertaining, but nowhere near as good as the above book."
5,Keep Following Your Dreams,"This book is all about following your dreams. If God has given you the desire to be used by Him in ministry to others, you must read this book. It is a step-by-step guide to encourage you and challenge you to follow God's call on your life. It is full of inspiring, personal stories and will encourage you to join God in the most excellent adventure of stepping out in faith as you discover and follow your dreams.As I began reading this book, I honestly couldn't put it down. TerKeurst spoke to my heart and her words sparked in me the desire to pick up my dreams after putting them down for a time."
5,A great complement to the Grace album,"For anyone who was left wanting more after Grace, this is a decent follow-up album.Here is Jeff as he really is. You can see how much of the magic of the Grace album was due to a back up band and studio processing and how much was really just Jeff. By this I mean that 90% of the magic in the studio was maintained by a single man's voice and guitar in a live setting. I was quite impressed. His playing, energy, vocal abilities, improvisational skill were not diminished at all. Not too many people can keep up with their studio releases (Rolling Stones' Steel Wheel tour, for example. Ugh!) but Jeff absolutely can.Also, Jeff talks a lot in between songs giving us an idea of who he was. And he adds a fair number of covers. So this album gives us a lot more than diminished version of Grace"
3,brilliant track selection but...,"This is definitely the ultimate collection judging by the track selection. Unfortunately the sound is dreadful, get the box set."
5,Walker Brothers,They are timeless! Their music brings back a feeling of the good old days! So glad this CD was available.
1,Rather lame and predictable,"Well, it's not BAD...just not different. Nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing stands out on this album. I like music, and have 400+ CDs so far.They're just another mediocre band stuck in the pack churning out radio-friendly tunes, complete with bland lyrics and uninventive guitar.Two stars perhaps because of good quality production? No, the music is so bland an unimaginative it puts me to sleep. Buy only if you need a sleep aid."
4,Knew them back when,I first saw Edgewater when they opened up for Dollybraid in March 1998. They were very intense and put on a great show. They passed out free CD's and t-shirts. From then to now they have changed alot. They had to change a bunch of lyrics because they signed with a record label. They sounded alot better in a hole in the wall club. Too bad they had to change their music to get signed.
1,Another record company made band. Numetal that's all.,"So many of these bands sound the same I think they should all just have the same name. How about The Sell Outs, or perhaps The Posers or maybe The Pretenders (oops that one is taken by a GOOD band already). That way, no one would have to pretend they have just discovered the one new band that doesn't really sound like the rest and isn't in it just for the quick money and quick fame. C'mon folks. Get real. These guys are just another nu metal band that won't be around in a year or two and I along with legions of others can't wait till this genre of music is gone and dead like disco. Temporary amusement for party background music while you talk with your pre high school friends and tell each other how cool this ""new"" band is, maybe. Quality rock music with soul, talent and heart, hardly."
5,Edgewater Rules,"This ablum is one of, if not, the best, I have ever heard in my life. The vocals are great and the music is just as good. I love this band. The songs are all meaningful and can be used to discribe almost any emotion. I realy suggest this album and this band to anyone. BUY IT! IT IS AWSOME!"
4,solid rock effort,"edgewater are the latest band to be swept up by wind up and given a chance, and i have enjoyed the rock that the label brought with atomship so i figured id give labelmates edgewater a try.i had heard ""eyes wired shut"" from the punisher and i enjoyed that song somewhat.""inhale"" is a good aggressive song with a nice mellow verse while ""science of it all"" breaks things into a choppy rhythm.""neglected"" is my favorite song on here-it is sickeningly good.this is a good album to chill out too, as it is not too heavy to just sit back and enjoy.its a cheap cd too so another plus.a good cd.for fans of atomship,breaking benjamin,and seven wiser."
3,South Of Sideways,"It's unfair to call Edgewater derivative of other bands since they've actually been around for a long while (long enough to earn a cover band), and they most certainly do focus on their craft rather than imitating their peers. Edgewater is a band that may be marketing a sound heard often on radio today, but neither can anyone deny that they have something going for them. Heavier tracks like Inhale and Quitter will please the hard rock crowd, and anthems like Eyes Wired Shut will draw in the radio listeners, but Edgewater's strongest suit is in their most honest works like Tres Quatros, Circles, or Lifter. Singer Matt Moseman struggles when in screaming mode, but as a singer he is effective and convincing, and the aforementioned tracks more than any others show his vocal skill. While originality is not readily apparent on the album itself, what is here is a very good start for the band to make a name for themselves among the masses."
4,this cd suprised me,these guys are pretty good every song is well done and there is really not a bad song on the cd. i have listened to the cd twice and find it to be a well written/song cd. i highly recommend picking it up.
4,The Struggle of Adopting an Unborn Child,"Sara Dewherst is fifteen and has always been an only child. Then, when Janie and Bob, friends of her parents', return from their vacation and come over with their adopted son for dinner. Sara's parents finally decide to adopt a child, which they had been longing for since Sara was born. During the story, Sara explains the joys and concerns of adopting a child, in a journal she keeps.I enjoyed this book because it was very explanatory. This was a wonderful book; if you enjoy books about adoption or teen pregnancy."
5,Interesting,"Like the previous reviewer, I have only recently learned about all the different temperaments. Honestly I have to say that the differences between the equal vs. Prelleur Fantasie are very subtle; perhaps I haven't listened for a long enough time to pick everything up.I'll have to say, however, that I don't find the 1/4 comma meantone version bland at all, but rather very interesting because of how hilariously off it can sound at times. That was a difference I picked up right away, (well, I guess I have to admit that 41 cents is a pretty big interval to be off by... ), which pretty much overshadows the ""habit-forming"" pure thirds."
3,"Pretty, but...","I enjoy this perfume, it smells a lot like lilacs however the scent does not last very long. A couple hours at most. I was very disappointed when I tried it and found that it was gone in just a short while."
5,great deal,"I was happy with the price, and how fast it was delivered! Happy Heart is my favorite so I was happy to find it with the lotion as well."
4,What I think,Extremely confortable to wear. Securely holds the phone. Clips tightly to belt. Best iPhone case i've seen so far.
5,You'll Fall Over Laughing,"Britta's is one of the lesser known British Comedies but what it lacks in fame, it surely makes up in hilarious content. Chris Barrie (of Red Dwarf fame) leads this cast of misfits. You can't believe the trouble they get into as they try to direct this fitness center. Definitely one of the best BBC comedies in years."
5,Just amazing british comedy,"Brilliant is a word that the brits use to convey absolute enthusiasm for any given product...and this show is just that...brilliant. Funny, well written stories, intertwine with the characters that are developed...from the receptionist with her baby in the drawer, up to Brittas himself, the well meaning, bumbling fool that he is. Take the time to watch the show...relish the humour and just sit back and enjoy!"
4,Britass Empire -- A hysterical romp into bureaucracy,"Chris Barrie potrays Gordon Britass, a man ""with a dream"" of bringing the world together through sports and leisure. Unfortunately, Gordon Britass is a man who gets under people's skins -- to the point where his wife can't stand the sight of him and his staff rejoice at the belief that he's been killed in a steel press. The series is in the same vein as Terry Gilliam's ""BRAZIL"" in which wrong is right and up is down. Gordon Britass makes you wish you had a flesh eating virus so you wouldn't have to be in the same room. The cast is first rate with actress Pippa Haywood who brilliantly portrays Gordon Britass' neglected, sex starved and despondent wife who longs for a life away from her miserable life -- in this case her husband. Buy it or rent it. Remember, you'll either love him or hate him (more than likely hate him). The Britass Empire is first rate."
2,Not Great,"Perhaps I've been spoiled by the hilarity of Red Dwarf, but I was not really impressed by this series. I was so excited, waiting for it to come, and then I watched it...and didn't laugh once. It's interesting enough but not really very funny, and I think I can see why it's not shown on PBS."
5,Makes me want to play in the rain! Nice beginner book,"It's a beautiful day and friends are outside playing.... until it starts raining. They think their fun is ruined but they soon discover rain clothes. Once on they continue playing outside and having a terrific time in the rain!This book is a level 1 reader for children kindergarten and 1st grade. The sentences are either 2 words and the pictures help children by ""giving them a clue"" to what the sentence is if your child is unsure. The book also does rhyming which is fun and helps reinforce hearing and recognizing rhyming words. My favorite is that the illustrated made the friends multi - cultural which is nice since everyone wants to see their face while reading and looking at a book."
5,Just Great,"This is the second book of Pauline that I read, and, from this on I started to look for all her books. I love the way she writes, the way she makes you live the story. This book is fantastic, you cry, you laugh, you feel everything that's happening. Thu suffer and I suffer, Thu learn and I learn. You have to read to understand what I'm saying"
1,disappointing,"""Child of the Morning"" was luminescent. This book was a broken bulb. Perhaps it was because of the first person viewpoint, which led the author to ""tell,"" rather than ""show."" Boring, flat, never dazzles or engages the reader. Can't fault her for trying...but, her heroine was not believable. Sorry."
5,MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS ALBUM,"BOUGHT THIS CD JUST BECAUSE IT SOUNDED DIFFERENT. IT HAS BECOME MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS ALBUM. THIS WAS MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO COWBOY MUSIC AND I HAVE BECOME A FAN BECAUSE OF THE FLYING W WRANGLERS. THE SONGS ARE ORIGINAL, THE JOKES JUST TOO FUNNY AND IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL WARM AND RELAXED. I LISTEN TO IT ALL YEAR AND STILL LAUGH AT SCOTTY'S STORIES. IF YOU LIKE MUSIC THAT'S NOT THE USUAL YOU'D LIKE THE FLYING W WRANGLERS."
5,"Flying W Wranglers ""A Cowboy Christmas""","Awesome, the best Christmas CD you'll ever buy! Nolip syncing, bling-bling, immodest entertainment just pure good olde talent and humor for the entire family to enjoy!"
5,Sreaker performance!,"When these speakers arrived i was stunned by the quality and the sound from such a small speaker,i tried them and used them as surronds in mybedroom. keep up the good work polk and thank you amazon.com for the sale."
2,Needs better pictures,"The author speaks of the pleasing cream color used on the stucco walls of a particular home, but we are looking at an ink drawing. There are no actual photograhs in the book. I didn't enjoy trying to ""imagine the color"" at all.I found it hard to recognize homes such as ""Oak Alley"" which I have actually visited. The line drawing did nothing to impress me at all. The artist line drawings do not do any home in the book any justice. It's unfortunate that after reading a small part of the book, I put it aside because I don't have a photo reference of the house I'm reading about.This book would be better left on the shelf. Don't waste your money."
4,Crammed with information.,"These old houses are a passion of mine. Have learned a lot about the floor plans and origons of Plantation houses and in particular, have found the glossary of building terms very informative in this book.A little disappointed to find that the text was prepared about 1939 and that many houses described are no longer existing which is a tragedy and a loss. I would also have preferred photos rather than drawings, though these are excellent examples of their kind. The author mentions that photos were taken. These would be a priceless record if accessible. Some may be listed with the Library of Congress."
5,The light that burns half as long...,"As you may know, Clifford T. Ward left us in 2001 after a 20 year battle with MS. Sad though this was, we are lucky to have been left with so many haunting songs.While the entire album is brilliant and a real showcase for his genius, tracks such as Gaye, Nightingale and Homethoughts From Abroad really undersore the fact that this man was literally second to none. This is as good as it gets, and his music holds its own against against any classics you could name.I always remember the line from Blade Runner where Eldon Tyrell, the designer of the Nexus-6 Replicants tells the android combat leader, ""The light that burns half as long burns twice as brightly..."" Well you burned so very brightly, Clifford. Thank you for everything."
3,"GREAT PRODUCT, DON""T BUY IT FROM THIS COMPANY","This Rosin was recommended to me by my mother. She said that she used it when she was in high school. This company may have the cheapest price, but they definitely don't have the best quality. The shipping was pathetic, and the rosin was actually cracked...but still, after all these years, it is still a great product."
3,"Good for beginners, sound improves with better stuff.","It's a decent rosin for beginners. As someone who is no longer a beginner, I personally do not care for the sound produced by this rosin."
5,Couldn't put it down,"This book of short stories held my interest from start to finish. I read the book in an evening. Some of the images I gained from these stories will stay with me forever. The writing is clear and concise, the stories are well crafted and fascinating. Some of the stories were so thought provoking, I intend to read them over again. This is quite an accomplishment for a first time published author. I can't wait for Kristina Olson's next book!"
3,too bitter for snacking,I guess this item would be fine for cooking however I found them just a bit too bitter for eating as a snack.
5,Painter X,Corel has improved on an already great product. Possibilities are unlimited!! Easy to use and learn.
2,"I was at the show, and it wasn't good live either..","I was at the 2nd night's show at the Warfield, and left the concert thinking ""eh, not a great show, the band seemed like it wasn't clicking, maybe the dvd will show me what I missed"". Waited a few months, and it turns out I didn't miss anything, the band was not playing very well together. I'm a big Scofield fan, and have seen Phil's other various bands many times, but the two styles really don't mesh well. Osby barely plays at all, and it sounds like he's not very interested when he does play. It looks like Phil and Sco are having fun on stage, but I don't think people uninitiated to the Phil/Dead style would find this dvd entertaining.Phil has brought the world alot of great music, but I don't think this band is as pleasant to watch for people who are critical & unbiased towards Dead songs. If there's one upside, it's Joan's singing, but I think her best songs ended up on the cutting room floor."
1,"Two Bands, One Stage","It just doesn't go together. Scofield and Osby are sailing at a much higher altitude. These are guys that hear everything and give back, but the rest of the band doesn't listen. I guess if one likes a non-singer singing and garage band jamming with a couple of ringers, it's dead on. However, if you're a Scofield or Osby fan, steer clear."
4,Avon Anew Clinical Eye Lift,This product does lift the upper eye area for me. The under eye area still has some puffiness but it has gotten better. I think this product works pretty well and would purchase it again.
1,Not good.,This stuff gets in your eyes and hurts. Its pretty bad and I saw no improvements. Expected much more.
3,Perfect!,"This eye cream is amazing. i love the duality. however, the instructions came in another language so I had to do research to figure how to use the product correctly."
1,Terrible,"I had high hopes for this over and under the eye 2 in 1 cream/gel but shortly after application it aged my eyes by at least 10yrs. puffy, wrinkly and droopy. I had to thoroughly wash it off and thank goodness was able to reverse the unsightly affect of this avon eye lift.I dont recommend this one."
3,Nothing special,"Avon Anew Clinical Eye Lift 2 In 1 JarI bought this product because it was recommended to me by a friend. She thought it was wonderful...I'm not thrilled with it.I don't fully understand the concept of a cream under the eye and a gel on the eyelid. I used it for a couple of weeks and saw no difference. The gel stung my eye if I was not careful and some got in my eye. I stopped using it at night and just use the avon night cream, without the gel."
5,Maintains my upper blepharoplasty,"I love this product! It is one of the best beauty products that I have ever used. I had an upper blepharoplasty in the early 1990s. I am 51 years old now, and my eyelids are still lifted. I have been using this product for about 8 to 10 years. It is inexpensive too!"
3,"Nice eye cream, but no lifting effect for me","I liked the dual nature of this product. The upper eye gel is nice and light so it doesn't interfere with eye makeup and the under eye cream is richer to attack wrinkles better. It makes a nice mosturizer, but I saw no lifting effects at all which is what I wanted this product for."
2,THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED!!!,"While it's a very nice soothing under eye cream, it did nothing at all for the upper lid area lift, which is why I bought this product. I even waited to make this review because I know it takes time for products to work, and your skin to absorb the nutrients. So DISAPPOINTED in this AVON product, and now I will have to spend money on trying to find another product. Maybe it takes longer than 6wks, so I'll keep using it, but ladies with this product you are really taking a chance on wasted money depending on how much ""lift"" you need to your upper eyelid. If you expect immediate results then don't bother. I didn't even get a slight lifting or tightening of any of the upper lid!!!"
4,Podhoretz segment,"Norman Podhoretz speaks about the book he has just written about his relationships with Hannah Arendt, Norman Mailer, Lillian Hellman, Lionel and Diana Trilling, Allan Ginsburg, key players in 'The Family' the NY intellectuals of the fifties. Podhoretz tells how people he was once very close to became estranged from him because of Politics. He turned againt that vein of the American Left which did not simply criticize America but came to truly hate it. Podhoretz took his magazine 'Commentary' to the right and in doing so left behind most of these people.Podhoretz is logical and clear, but he is not entertaining and not brilliant in speech. A solid and sober reasonable presentation is what he makes in this conversation. His ex-buddy Mailer would have been more crazy and outrageous, but also more amusing."
5,An Islamic Perspective,"In this work Dr. Badawi elucidates the Islamic world-view, its timeless values and its psychological insights into the nature of man and contrasts it with the modernistic Western world-view. In the light of the recent events in New York City and Washington, it has never been more important to seek for means of understanding."
3,Well...,"this author's translation from Arabic are excellent, and have done an immeasurable surface for English-speaking Muslims and his bio of Imam al Haddad was fascinating. However, this book is a mixed bag. The first portions- concerning the 7 heavens, 7 earths, Footstool, Throne, the first and second sides of the soul, spirit, intellect, etc. are somewhat complex and difficult to follow (I found myself skimming at times)- although including some interesting information (although, as he points out, they are unknown to most Muslims). The critique of the west is solid, if not new, as is the section on the Times. The best part of this book is its chapter on Islamic normative values (about a quarter of the book)- which beautifully depicts the Muslim world-view, of God, of social relations etc. That is what I would recommend this book for. But definitely check out his works on Imam al-Haddad."
4,good product,"laminated some things are hard to read but will serve its purpose in my b.o.b. . like that it shows a lil ways over the ga line, will be buying more."
5,Excelent dynamic mic!,This dynamic microphone cant be beaten for the price Ive tested the pro61 with a Shure SM58 and the audio technica was superior in every way. Sorry Shure!I sing in my band and use this mic for vocals but I have used it too for micing guitar amps with great results. In fact I'm considering buying another one.
3,Disappointing,"One of the last books written by the great SciFi master John Brunner but alas not a good one. According to the rule SciFi writers tend to ruminate when getting old, JB gets ideas across not in actions as he used to but in long debates. A lot of talks I ended up skipping. A confusing story encompassing too many themes with an unsatisfactory ending."
3,Good book but fizzles out,"Interesting stories as the Ship revisits colony planets along its sweep of the Arm of Stars. The automated Ship is developing more humanity as the story proceeds, but we don't get to see that fully develop."
4,back jacket summary,"front cover of the Del Rey March 1992 paperback editionCover art by John BerkeyAmong the six hundred thousand stars in the vast Arm of Stars, over six hundred planets had been seeded with uman stock by the greatest feat of technology ever achieved, the Ship. And on each of the worlds, the memory of the Ship had faded into legend over the years.The Ship, however, still endured, watching over the colonies on a cyclical and seemingly endless journey through time and space. But in its long odyssey, the Ship had somehow been damaged-it had become as conscious, and lonely, as any human being. And as it visited, again and again, each of the worlds it had seeded, it found tragedy in its wake. For the humans of the Arm of Stars were becoming more and more alien. Even worse, the Ship was beginning to change in other ways its designers had never intended..."
3,Don't bother for Kindle,"I purchased the kindle edition. The dictionary itself seems quite good, unfortunately as it has not yet been indexed you can not use the search function, making it useless as a quick reference tool."
5,Manuela,"From rags to riches back to rags, Manuela Saenz leads an extraordinary life with Simon Bolivar, the South American liberator, whom she idolized as a young girl. Manuela proves that she is more than just an illegitimate daughter and family outcast, along with her personal slaves Natan and Jonotas, she gathers information for the movement earning herself a medal and even faces battle dressed as a man in order to thwart an ambush on Bolivar and his troops and is then given the title of la Coronela (colonel). The liberator of the Liberator exhibits passion, vitality, and strength as much as she does conviction for the cause, the freedom of South American people. Manrique's novel is an engaging page turner from the start."
4,Haglund's helper,I researched products to relieve my achilles tendon heel spur (Haglund's deformity) with little success. I tried this pad and it really helps take the pressure off. I use the pad in shoes with heels and wear heeless shoes otherwise. I have been pain free for 2 months.
2,Quality is suspect no warranty!,"I bought thisnsleeve to protect my incision scar from Achilles surgery. For that use, it is a reasonable solution to putting a new bandaid everyday until my scar heals. HOWEVER, after wearing it for three sessions of 2 hours, one hour and 30 minutes of working out, the gel Pad has already begun to split along the edge...for $21, this is an expensive product with no durability. Furthermore, the manufacturer does not provide a warranty and will send you in circles to resellers and distributors to resolve this. HPMS was very professional but the Silipos company sounds like a garage shop business in my interaction with them to get this customer service/product quality issue resolved. Depending on resolution, I would consider raising the rating to one more star."
4,Heel Pain,My husband has very painful achilles heel pain. This sock has put off him having surgery. They are easy to care for and has had his for about 6 months now. Very well put together. I would recommend this product.
1,No Support!,Word of warning - this provides NO support - was little more than a loose sock. Certainly not worth $20+ each!! I returned mine the next day...
4,WORKS GREAT,THIS WAS TO REPLACE THE SAME PRODUCT USED FOR FOUR YEARS PRIOR AND IS STOP CHAFFING ON HEAL WHEN WALKING BUT PAID NEARLY FOUR TIMES AS MUCH FROM A PODIATRIST OFFICEDOES THE JOB FINE
5,GREAT PRODUCT,this will be the 4th silipos achilles heel pad i have purchased-simply the best-only way i can play hours of tennis with my tender achilles..
3,Silipos Achilles Heel Pad,I purchased the X-Large and I wear a man's 10.5The fit was good. The gel cushioning is very thin however. I thought it would have been thicker than the thickness of a dime. With that being said made well and nice fit but poor achilles heel padding. They should consider doubling the thickness of it. It would be awesome than.
3,W H A T.......N O......P I C T U R E S .....? ? ? ? ?,"FASHION AND COSTUME IN AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE: A REFERENCE GUIDE, has much good information, and many charts. It also boasts a full and complete index and bibliography. However, any fashion book on fashion, without one illustration, (I've looked everywhere in the ""Look In This Book"" feature, graciously supplied by the publisher and Amazon), does not seem a full reference book to me. Yes, this information IS available elsewhere -- but why NOT conveniently put into this volume as well? It starts with fashion in the 17th century -- and fashion HAS changed a lot since then! For the price of this book, a few illustrations should definitely be added, at least for the next, and future editions!"
3,"Good Idea, But....","The idea behind this book is wonderful but unfortunately a lot of the questions are silly and pointless.However, I did find 1000 really good questions at questionsforcouples. com"
1,No stars,"A completely worthless, seemingly random list of silly questions. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
4,Not one of his better known LPs,"I'm not sure any of the songs on this album were hits and to be honest, some of the songs aren't my favorite JD songs. But I consider this an essential addition to my collection. I did not buy this album on vinyl (as I did many of his others) mainly because I just didn't care for the songs at the time it came out. Maybe because I'm older, maybe because he's been gone for a while now and can't make new music, but I've come to appreciate Autograph as a representation of a time in JD's life. I don't love it the way I love many of his other LPs, but hey, it was only a few bucks for the CD and for a true John Denver fan, it's a must."
3,So so,GPS runs pretty good but atleast here or Puerto Rico it doesn't show all the new roads that have been constructed. So you can say a tourist that uses this TomTom here will probably get lost. If only it could update itself via WEB with all the new roads I would say that this GPS is fantastic!Another thing is that the POI (Point of Interest) only shows AIRPORTS & POSTOFFICES for Puerto Rico.
2,Screen is very poor as are the maps,"The screen is not visible if there is any sunlight or glare. A website just compared all GPS units on terms visibility, and this one came in dead last.The maps are the worst out there for the United States. Unlike their competition, TomTom does not use Navateq maps. Not nearly as many POIs, and the maps are incomplete and in error.The unit itself is simple to operate and gets the GPS signal quickly. However, this unit has a poor display and the worst maps on the market. And the mount isn't very good either."
2,Can't get there from here.,It's bad when it can't even find your own home. There are some nice features but they are overshadowed by it's inaccuracies in finding addresses.Can not be trusted.
2,Don't Buy if near US/Canada Border,"This GPS comes with US map on the SD card and Canada map on the included CD but never the twain shall meet.By car I'm a few hours from Canada and several days from the eastern US but I can't swap out the faraway eastern US part of the map on the TomTom Go 300 for a nearby Canadian map. It's either all Canada or all contiguous US. This is a major functional flaw if you live near the US/Canada border or live further away and like to take cross-border trips.Oh, and if you do decide to swap out the US map, be sure to save it on your computer first - TomTom doesn't bother to provide a backup on the CD so if you don't first make your own backup before changing to the Canadian map you can't later get the US map back."
2,Disposal Item - No repair available from Tom Tom,"Overall I liked my Tom Tom Go, until it was 15 months old and went blank refusing to turn on. It was dead. I called Tom Tom support and they said send it in. I did, they called and said it was out of warranty, which is 1 year. I agreed, how much to fix it? Sorry we don't fix them, we through them out, no repairs. But, we'll sell you another one for only $300. And, it will be the same model you have, no upgrade to current model.I think this is a real rip off. I spent about $650 USD for this and it worked 15 months, then throw it out when it breaks.Be aware if you buy Tom Tom products. They do not offer reasonable support."
1,It looks cute but quality sucks,"TomTom go looks cute, and functionality is not too bad. But the products have low quality. If your unit is out of warranty, you are out of luck. It goes bad easily. You are better off buying Garmin. That's what happened to mine. After 1.5 year, my TomTom just broke. Couldn't be fixed and warranty expires. I wish I had done more research. I am buying a Garmin now."
4,"Great product, no regret.","I bought TomTom Go 300 one month ago and I don't go to mapquest any more.I works fine as you open the box and connect power.Howerver, during the day time, it is kinda hard to see it and I think it depends onwhere you put it.I installed it on Toyota Sienna and the minivan has deeper winshield so it was far fromthe driver seat.I manage to put it on the dash board right beside the air condition fan, it got much better.Overall, it worth the money."
3,DON'T BUY THE KINDLE VERSION!,"This is an exquisitely beautiful and moving book, and the book itself gets an uniquivocal five stars from me. But the kindle edition is a mess, with passages spliced together and in the wrong place. Buy this book, but buy the paperback!"
1,Reaganite propaganda; reality will differ,what's real sad is those war criminals like Negroponte who were behind this crime against humanity are now in charge in Iraq. One now returns as Bush's ambassador to Nicaragua to foment further disasters there. See here the lies of papa Bush.
3,Mike Hammer songbird,"This is a good Mike Hammer mystery but not as good as the 80's Mike Hammer. However this is still a great ""who done it"". A must for All Mike Hammer addicts."
2,very disappointing,"I was totally psyched about this book when I first heard about it months ago,so I was keenly disappointed to find out that it's not at all what I thought it would be-see,since it's from the publishers of Rolling Stone I assumed it would feature photographs that have appeared in RS,by photographers like Mark Seliger and David LaChapelle...NOPE,the portaits you'll find in this book are ones you've seen a million times,in countless publications.The WORST thing about this book,the thing that really annoyed me,was how pathetically underrepresented WOMEN are.There are only a few women in the entire book,and the pictures aren't even good.A few of the portraits of male musicians are okay,which is why I gave this 2 stars rather than 1.But on the whole I wouldn't recommend buying this book."
1,Photographs of the famous..Oh yes and some tattoos.,"I was disappointed when I received this book. The title is very deceitful. What the book really showed was posed photographs of rock stars and actors. What was not shown were detailed photographs of tattoos, nor was there really any explanation or narrative about the individual photograph itself. The book is weak and definately not for someone interested in tattoos. However, if your interested in photographs of a few famous people, you should buy the book."
2,"I THOUGHT I knew how to ""read for comprehension""","I don't know if this author is just showing off... or if he REALLY writes this way, but I have to read everything TWICE and then I'm still feeling like ""duhhhhh"".. Maybe it's me... Maybe it's the content, but think they could have made this an easier read SOMEHOW!"
3,BOOK IS GOOD FOR NATURE-LOVERS,"Like the previous reviewer, the book is a compilation of interesting places and finds on the Island, rather than a travel-itinerary. Maps of trails, hidden beaches and brief historical quips throughout, it is entertaining but not ""fact-filled"". I also believe that, in comparison to other Cayman books, it is a bit over-priced at $19.95."
2,It's out of print but don't lose sleep over it.,"The book is O.K. if you just want to know about the Caymans, but if you're planning a trip, it's weak on practical information. There are no names or phone numbers for any rental car company, hotel, condo, or restaurant, but many pages of organizations (with phone numbers) such as the Cayman Islands Dominoes Association (yes really). If you are able to find a car rental company there is a chapter on exploring the island, and if not there are chapters on hiking, running, bicycling, horseback riding, kayaking, and swimming"
4,Bluetrek S2,"I have had my S2 for about a year now and have been very happy with it. It is extremely comfortable and light. The talk time and standby time is very long, close to what they advertise. The quality from what people tell me on the other end is very good. Set up was quick and easy. I also have the Bluetrek G2. which is not as comfortable but works well. I prefer the S2. It fits in the ear better and does not flop around. This is one of the lightest on the market being at about 12-13 grams if I recall. You can really feel the difference from the heavier Motorolas."
2,My $30 Jabra Does A Better Job,"Wow. More money doesn't always equal better quality. My Bluetrek was $60. My Jabra was $30. After just purchasing a new cell phone and returning it for a new one because I thought the phone was the problem, I realize it's the bluetooth. There is constant static and crackling on the Bluetrek when I get more than 5 feet away from the phone. Sometimes, there's static or a poor connection even when the phone is close by. I so wish I was still within the return period on this Bluetrek. I would never buy it again. I gave it 2 stars because it does work just not very well."
3,Bluetrek S2 Bkuetooth Headset,"I really love the way this works re. hands-free operation. There are a couple of things that the manuafturer might want to look at however. First, it falls apart easily. In order to keep it together, I put a black rubber band around it. this is the second one I have had and the first one did the same thing. The other thing is, it flashes a blue light intermittently and is a source of irritation, disrupting concentration when in conversation with someone while wearing it. Lastly, there is some distortion in hearing at higher volumes, but difficult to hear at all in lower volumes."
2,Energizer bunny,"This battery on this thing lasts forever, i use mine a lot during the day, sometimes 6 hours or more and it will go for days. Feedback with other bluetooth headsets are slight problem, and callers sometimes complained of echoing on their side. Battery life is extrordinary to say the least but the downside to all this is it is just not durable. After 4 months both of them, i purchased one for someone else as well, are broken. The speaker for the ear is so weak now we had to quit using them. The price is a bargain, but i guess you get what you pay for."
3,Bluetooth headset,"Although the sound and reception on this device was good, it was very uncomfortable. It actually hurt my ear. It was also diffcult to turn on and off."
1,the lowest quality knives in the Shun line,"The negative reviews based on chipping is due to the fact that these knives are made of VG-10 Staneless steel which is sub par when compared to the more expensive lines that use SG2 steel for the core (blade). Walk into any William Sonoma and ask to see a Shun Classic (cheap) and a Shun Fuji (expensive) kinfe. You'll see that the Classic line has a damascus print on the blade while the Fuji has actual damascus cladding. Even the handle is of higher quality. The Classic knives are much cheaper, but once you notice the difference, you probably won't want them. I'd rather have one Shun Fuji chef knife (will use 90% of the time) than an entire set of Shun Classic knives (which will cost more)."
1,"If I could give zero stars, I would.","Apparently, the people who gave this knife a 5 star hasn't had it for very long. The blade chips. If you search online, you'll find many people complaining of this. All Kai/Shun customer service has done was sharpen it when it clearly needs to be replaced. These knives are not ""hand crafted"". They are mass produced. They are not made of Damascas steel, only designed on the exterior to look like it. They are not made in the samurai custom, or my knife would probably not be chipping. Do your research before you buy."
5,My only complaint,"Is that there is no 12"" version. Sure, the pseudo-Damascus blade surface is just eye-candy, but the very thin VG-10 blade is the best I've ever worked with. Thin equals lightweight, and I had to adjust my balance a little (from a top-line Messermeister). I thought I would miss that weight when chopping kale, but the superior sharpness of the Shun Classic Kershaw wins out. Also, it is very maneuverable--the blade has a less sharp drop at the end, sort of a cross between French shape and the German shape.I use this knife every day and easily maintain its edge with a 12"" oval diamond steel.In Japan, everyone is forced to be right-handed, so the asymmetrical handle is perfect for right-handers like me, but southpaws probably would not like this knife."
5,One sharp knife,Love the way this knife cuts. Well balanced in the hands and cuts just about anything like butter.
2,"Sharp, but poor quality","The knife is nicely balanced and holds an edge well. For the first four months of ownership I was extremely pleased with the knife. Recently, however, the blade broke in two places so that ""chunks"" of metal are missing from the edge. This happened while cutting veggies, not stones. The knife is useless and to my surprise, Amazon will not issue a refund.While this may be a one-off occurrence, I would not buy this brand again.Update (January 2013): Reflecting on all the comments: (1) Amazon is so good about product support, I thought it was realistic to hope for a refund; (2) I did return the knife to the US distributor and after a few weeks received a sharpened knife. The original ultra-sharp edge was removed and the underlying steel blade was sharpened. So on balance, I have a nice knife, but not the thin and sharp Shun; (3) The Shun is a nice knife, but too fragile for me. It is possible to get comparable, but more durable knives."
4,My right hand,Having a knife that fits your hand and is balanced makes prep a snap. The angle and type of steel keeps it sharp and easy to keep sharp. The fact it looks good is a bonus...
1,"Major, major disappointment!!","This has been my worse purchase and unfortunately it was a gift for my husband who owns top of the line knives. He was missing a Shun and I have sent the knife back twice due to chipped blade both the times and the logo on the knife has rubbed off(within 8 months). They sent a replacement with help of contacting the head of Shun.3 years later, after returning the knife twice, It looks like crap. The blade has chipped in several locations and we just don't use it anymore(Too much work to contact Shun again). Other competitive knives have help up longer and stronger and the logo has not rubbed off, even our $9 daily use knife.The look of the Shun knife is awesome but for decorative purposes. It was a waste of my $123.99, I would go somewhere else to spare the headache."
1,Junk,"We barely used this knife for a couple of weeks and the tip broke off and the blade has pockmarks all over it. The handle design is very poor for heavy use, as my hand kept slipping forward towards the blade. There is no indent to get a good grip and keep your hand in place. We're returning this knife and sticking with the $15 carbon/stainless chef's knife I bought when I was in college."
5,Great knife for right OR left handers!,"I disagree with one of the posters who said that this knife was not for left handers.I'm left handed and I've done quite a bit of knife work with a variety of chef's knives, and I can honestly say that this is probably one of the nicest knives I've ever used. I 've had this knife since February, and I've had no problems whatsoever cutting despite the d-shaped handle.If you're left handed, like me, and you really appreciate a good kitchen knife, give this one a try."
1,Very BRITTLE and will CHIP,"I recently bought the entire set (We bought it through William Sonoma). We are not frequent cooks and was disappointed to see that after a few uses this knife has a chip in it. The blade is very sharp but VERY thin so you will not be able to cut anything except vegetables. For the amount they are charging, it is NOT worth it to spend this kind of money just to cut vegetables. Save your money for something better."
5,This knife is great,"I bought this knife after researching most of the high-end kitchen knives (henckels, wusthoff, global, etc). It has performed great in my kitchen. The VG-10 steel core lets me but a scary-sharp edge on it (using my Spyderco Sharpmaker) to where I can pretty much slice through a tomato using just the weight of the knife.The D-shaped handle fits great in my hand. If you are left-handed, make sure to get the left-handed model. The curve and balance of the blade makes it easy to chop and dice things.The only minor thing that I noticed was that it wasn't razor sharp when I got it, but I fixed that in about 5 minutes.Overall, I really like this knife. It looks great and works great."
5,This knife is amazing,The craftsmanship is amazing. It arrived literally razor sharp from tip to tang. The unique handle shape feels great in the hand. It's so much sharper than our regular knifes that you have to be careful using it until you get used to how it cuts.. VERY happy with the purchase.. Will look @ getting a shorter one next.
4,Afraid I was going to slice an atom.,"I love my Shun knife. I use it daily. Its very comfortable, hefty but not too heavy. Sharp you ask? Its so sharp it might be able to split an atom and destroy your entire neighborhood. So be careful."
1,Terrible crusher,"Although a handy size, this is a terrible pill crusher as the pill bits get stuck in the crushing mechanism, making it useless or a tremendous amount of work to get the crushed pill out."
3,Crush Pills,Works good but wears out over time. The treads on the crush part wear down and done work. Works great other than that.
2,"Great cutter, TERRIBLE crusher.","This thing makes it SUCH a pain to crush up your medication. There always seems to be too many large chunks left no matter how many times you shift it around and grind it again. The cutter, however, works phenomenally. I especially like the flexible sides in it that allow for larger pills to stay put. The drinking cup is also a pretty nifty bonus for those who prefer to dissolve their medicine in water or something. Just do NOT buy this thing if you plan to use it primarily as a crusher."
1,Useless Pill Crusher & Grinder in my opinion,"My pekingese suffers from Congestive Heart Failure and I have to give him 5 pills 3 times daily. I have been searching for a good pill cutter and crusher.In my opinion, this one is a total waste. I trust Amazon reviews and am surprised to see this item rated highly. Here is my take:Pill Cuttter - made of smooth plastic with nothing to keep the pill in place. The pill either flies out the front or slips and is not cut precisely. A good pill cutter needs a flexible surface or guide to hold the pill being cut.Grinder - only works on soft pills which I can crush in a mortar and pestle faster. Plus, the screw top jams when the pill is inside and the teeth fill with whatever pill is ground and have to be washed. Prescriptions are a precise science, to have a grinder that leaves even 5% of the pill behind risks a bad dose.I'm tossing this one in the trash!!"
4,It Works,"This pill splitter works pretty well. I tried it on some of my denser pills that are very hard to chop with smaller splitters and it worked well. I don't need the crusher portion, but it looks like it will work too."
5,Excellent Pill grander,"Excellent pill grander, the best one I have ever found!!! It suppose to be all you are going to need for using or storing meds."
4,Pill Crusher Works!!,This pill crusher is the preferred style as the internal design crushes the pill beautifully and allows for easy dispensing.
2,cheapo - returned it,"I purchased this scale primarily to weigh out ingredients for mixing materials for small scale concrete projects (e.g. concrete counters), but after opening the box you can immediately tell this is not a high quality item. The whole thing feels tinny, lightweight, and flimsy. To assess the accuracy I used various free weights from an olympic set, everything from 2lbs to 35lbs, and I would rarely get the same weight 2x (ie, totally inaccurate). I thought that maybe this unit was just a defect, but then I also felt like it just was not a high-quality product so I just returned it. Instead I purchased the larger 250lb metal (flat) scale from Pelouze. It seems to handle weights more consistently."
3,Super Reader,"In a scorching hot Metropolis summer, some dodgy Hollywood types are out to sabotage the production of a big budge crappy plot update of the Robin Hood story.Perry White sends Lois and Clark in undercover to find out what is going on with all the accidents. Lois works it out while Superman runs around saving lots of people from heat-induced accidents."
1,Disapointing,"Having read other books of same author for babies, I bought this one to be disappointed by the religious approach, you teach your child to be christian and he will be good, if he is bad, evil has got him, Come on ... BS."
3,the christmas collection/Il Divo,ok but only a few songs that are easy to listen too. not all my idea of christmas although was on the list when i bought it so my fault for getting it.
4,The Christmas Collection/Il Divo,"The Christmas Collection/Il Divo , Christmas gift and I'm sure she will appreciate this great collection. Love the other DVD's"
5,Absolute Must Have,"This album is the best Christmas album. I play it so much, I will have to buy another copy for backup, I'm afraid the first one will get worn out by the time Christmas gets here. You have to have this album for your collection."
3,Almost There,"These young men have beautiful voices; some pieces they present are wonderfully moving. I was disappointed in the selection--I can think of many carols that would have better served their abilities on a Christmas album than Over the Rainbow and even Ave Maria. Hopefully their producers will work to find them more classical pieces for future works. Still in all, they are a joy to hear."
3,Purell is better,Wanted to like this - for the brand and the scent. But in the end it seemed to leave my hands feeling greasy (not moisturized) vs. Purell. I feel like I have to rinse them off before touching food. Scent is nothing great either.
5,Sturdy and easy to assemble,"I was looking for boxes that could be used both for moving and for storage. The Bankers Boxes proved to be very easy to assemble, it takes no more that 10 seconds with a little practice. I could fill them with heavy books ""to the brim"" and they hold very well. Since they are stackable, I can store a lot of things while using little space."
1,"Poorly cut, difficult to assemble","These are awful boxes. They are almost good, but the set I received has flaps that are much too long. When you assemble the box, you cannot easily tuck the side walls into the body of the box. You have to smoosh and crimp them, very annoying. Once assembled, they are sturdy enough. Weirdly, I assemble a lot of different boxes at my job and these are VERY POOR QUALITY."
4,Mitch Miller 16 mosst requested songs,I so well remember Mitch Miller and the Gang. I am happy to have some of his recordings so I can enjoy once again. His music is so upbeat and cheerful and makes me feel fortunate to have lived in a time when this kind of artist did so much to entertain the country with his memorable music.I would recommend this album to anyone who remembers this guy.
4,Bad Business,I enjoyed this story enough to purchase the book to reread. I like Robert Parker's writings! I have read all of his books!
1,"Solid, But Uninspiring","I have had a hard time getting into the Spenser books. I have tried numerous times, but he just fails to capture my imagination. This is a solid mystery, but did not convince me to return to the series."
2,"""One of parker's waekest.""","Very fragmented. Not a smooth transition from chapter to chapter. Too many charecters. Spenser gets support from Healy (state police), Vinnie, Hawk, Quirk, and Belson. Vinnie comes across as a unpaid ""security guard."" Hawk is not his usaul brilliant thug self but more a cerebral ""assitant detective."" Spenser is not in danger yet Hawk and Vinnie work for him for nothing. The thing that kills the book is it's the way it bounces from chapter to chapter. Very weak and almost disorganized trensitions."
3,Average,"I think this is one of his weakest novels. Its not that bad but since I read all of his books I definately expected something more exciting and its not happening here. As previous reviewer said, too many characters. You may have hard time remembering who is who and who is supposed to be doing what. Story itself drags on without too much action. Dissapointing."
4,"Sex, corruption and murder most foul","Robert Parker never fails to please with the Spenser series and he hits another home run with ""Bad Business,"" an intricately plotted maze of corporate corruption, sex and murder most foul. It all begins simply enough when Maureen Rowley walks into his office, looking for someone to follow her husband Trent to find grounds for her divorce case. There is a bit of a complication when Spenser discovers another PI following Trent Rowley's mistress, and one following Maureen as well. Then things get ugly really quickly when Trent Rowley is found murdered in his office a couple days later. As Spenser tries to learn more about what is going on at Kinergy - the company Trent Rowley worked at - as well as a man named Darrin O'Mara, a talk radio host who keeps turning up - the bodies start to pile up.Not to be missed by the fan of Spenser and Robert B Parker!"
4,SPENSER MY GUY,IF YOU ARE A SPENSER FAN THIS SET OF MOVIES WILL SATISFY A HUNGER FOR A GOOD SPENSER MOVIE. IT MIGHT EVEN TAKE YOU DOWN MEMORY LANE
2,"""He Said, She Said""","I haven't finished listening to this unabridged audio book. However, there's just way too much ""he said, she said"", etc. It may not be nearly so obvious on the written page, but the audio version really emphasizes this trait of the author. I've listened to LOTS of audio books, and this is the first time I've ever noticed this problem. It makes it really hard to pay attention to the plot!By the way, the person who gave me the book warned me about this when she handed it to me. (I really didn't understand what she was saying at the time.) So, that makes two of us who feel the same way."
3,Back in the groove,"This Parker/Spenser stays on the same solid, predictable, but entertaining track as BACK STORY. Spenser is his familiar, wonderful old self -- doing all the right things for his own reasons, living up to his personal code of ethics, and appalled when the world doesn't do the same. The plot is more ""Law and Order/ripped from today's headlines"" than many of Parker's other efforts, but it doesn't suffer from it and doesn't seem like exploitation. Susan appears in the story for no particular reason, but at least she doesn't annoy me so much my teeth hurt this time. It's not thought provoking Spenser, like MORTAL STAKES or RACHEL WALLACE, but it's solid, welcome time spent with old friends."
3,Good little page turner,"""Bad Business"" is a reliable mid-level Spenser entry... it isn't among the memorable greats (""Early Autumn"", ""A Catskill Eagle"", ""Small Vices"") but it isn't needlessly convoluted or clunky like some of the lesser volumes (""Sudden Mischief"", ""Hush Money""). It's got the quips, a nice little plot heavy on sex and greed (both topics always good in a thriller), an amusing new supporting character or two (Spenser's CPA friend is fun) and continues the happy trend of recent Spensers by not relentlessly promoting the value of psychiatrists and therapists to the reading public. All in all, an enjoyable read."
2,Many plots,"First, I read a lot of mysteries and I'm a very strong, long term fan of the modern semi-hard-boiled, yet sensitive, Spenser series by Robert B. Parker.But ... Bad Business is different from most of Parker's - it doesn't seem quite ""fair"" in the sense the reader could not have put it all together before the end (at least THIS reader certainly couldn't!). Spenser is fine, Susan is fine, Hawk is fine, just too many other characters, too many plots, too many hard-to-believe circumstances - the ending seems contrived ... one of numerous possible scenarios, most hard to believe.Sorry, it was OK, but far from his best ... which are REALLY good!! If you're new to the series start with another one, i.e., better and more representative. If you're committed to reading them all, maybe you'll do better with this one than I did ... :>)"
