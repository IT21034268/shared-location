3,Very light in weight,"I purchased the grey set a week back. The skillets are nice and deep, non-stick coating works well. They are very thin though and feel too light when held. Only time will tell how durable they are..."
2,Thunderbird Clock Radio,"This is a very cheaply made product. Switches, speaker, controls, all feel like they are going to break in your hand. Not worth the price. The clock in mine was defective and I had to return it. I did not want another one."
1,Breach of consumer trust,"Markspace has truly breached ""shareware ethics,"" if such a thing exists. I owned this application for far less than a year, but as soon as I upgraded to Tiger, it became incompatible and I was notified I'd have to pay 20 dollars (on top of the 40 dollar original price) for an upgrade. Customarily, shareware upgrades are optional unless there has been a drastic OS change- a developer has to _earn_ upgrades by including new features or improvements. Bugfixes and compatibility fixes, in both the shareware and commercial software world, are usually free.And while markspace claims that Tiger is radically different than Panther, why did Pocketmac (the alternative PocketPC sync program) allow Tiger compatibility in just a free point release? Shame on Markspace for at least not extending their free upgrade cutoff time to 1 year. No one should purchase software with an active life of half a year. Markspace is abusing its userbase."
1,Missing Sync - Mac to Windows Mobile,"This was a great product at first. But once windows mobile was updated it became the worst nightmare I've ever had. It ruined 75% of my contacts and deleted atleast 10% of the rest. It would freeze every time I tried to sync my music and when I contacted their customer service they basically in not so few words told me it was my computers fault. I'm on a Mac, I'd have believed that if it was a PC. But I did a fresh install anyway just to prove it was there software. I've never heard from them since. Now I'm on an android phone and they want $40 not for their zero customer service software. I don't normally leave bad reviews unless you really screw me over. But yeah this is by far the worst computer software I've ever paid money for in my 29 years of life. Don't buy if you can possibly avoid it."
1,Missing Sync misses the mark,Purchased the product for my Palm Pre to replace Chapura sync. Short story is I couldn't get it to work. Contacted tech support and they suggested disabling my virus software permanently to make it work. Yeah right! Still waiting for my refund. Looks like I'm going to have to get PayPal involved to get my money back which is a real pain in the....
1,Scam-ware beware!,Bought Missing sync for Android and had problems from the start. Support was poor and never I got it to work on my Droid phone and Outlook. Dragged their feet on a refund until Paypal refund option expired then they wanted my credit card number!! Even the new 1.5 version was garbage. Locked up on installing on Windows 7. Still trying to get my money back. I would not trust these crooks.
1,This Company Sucks,This company screwed me ... due to a flaw in their system ... don't support them they will end up making you pay for another license
3,Only slightly less worse than the Palm Desktop/iSync solution,"Appears to have lots of extra bells and whistles, but at the end of the day the core functionality (sync calendar, contacts, Memos and To Dos) is unstable. Very frustrating"
3,Not what was expected.,The product is very expensive for what little use it has.Also it does not seem to get the wrinkles out of curtainsthat much. The hose is way too short.
5,FINALLY SOME NICE SHIRTS AND PANTS,"This is great. Doesn't do a perfect job on some shirt materials, but helps significantly for those impossible shirts. The steam relaxes the fabric, then it takes a simple iron to fix. Works great on jeans and pants and general cotton based shirts. Just what I was looking for. I use it every day."
1,Don't buy this one!,"This steamer worked for about a week and then starter to work intermintently. HOT water was condensing in the hose and spilling out of the unit. The hot water burned my wife. I sent the unit back to CONAIR, they refunded my money, but said that this was normal operation and that their engineers found no problems with the unit. I seems that they think a unit that spills boiling hot water on you is normal. I have since replaced it with a different brand and have had no propblems. Pass this one by."
2,buy a good steam iron instead,"This steamer was only useful to get the wrinkles out of clothes that had been really balled up... it gets them to a state where you can IRON them more easily, but basically saturates with the steam so the fabric is damp. Sure there is technique to learn, but I spent a good long time on several different items. It heats up quick and produces steam well etc, but it performed far below what I thought were reasonable expectations. It also has a low hanger so you constantly have to extend the hose to let the condensation run back down or else get gurgling and low output. I returned it, amazon was good about that, and the return shipping was less than what amazon charged me in the first place."
4,Gordo and Teri were definitely meant to be together!,"I was left in suspense wondering what wuold happen to Teri... there were three guys that she knew and sorta of liked, and you are always wondering stuff like ""Is Mark still interested?"" ""But Scott isn't a Christian?"" and ""What about Gordon?"" I thought that at the end before accepting Gordon's proposal they should have gotten to know each other better, but things work out fine in the end."
1,Doesn't work for people with high tolerences,"Bought 2 bottles and took 4 caps at a time once or twice a day for about a month. No affect, if there was any change it would of been an increase in anxiety."
3,right fit,"i can now fit it to an old steel frame and it goes along ,final piece in puzzle, to get my bike working."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with Medicaid for Long Term Nursing Home Care. It gave a general overview, but very few details. There was nothing that I hadn't already read elsewhere. I felt like I had paid to read an advertisement for attorneys."
2,More of Disney's Angel Angle,"The names have been changed but the similarities with ""Angels in the Outfield"" outweigh the differences. In both cases, Disney's angels exist to boost human self-confidence, extract tears and elicit laughs, even if they have to stoop to manipulative melodrama or nose-picking type humor to accomplish these things. One difference between ""Infield"" and ""Outfield"" is that we see heaven in ""Infield"", and it is not a pretty sight. Disney's heaven is a dangerous, gloomy world full of mashed potatoes and evidently only right-handed people can go there because Babe Ruth made it to Disney heaven, but he had to convert to right-handedness. Small children will probably enjoy the slapstick but others will receive more nourishment from real mashed potatoes."
3,Angels in the Infield,"Angels in the InfieldI didn't know that they had made a followup to Angels in the outfield, I bought this DVD so that I could have a sequel movie to Angels in the Outfield.This Movie is NO where as good as the first and Now I am not surprised that I have never heard of it.It was a Little dissappointing.As for the service it was GREAT The product was received VERY Fast and in EXCELLENT Condition!!!"
1,WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF MOVIES,WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN AND I HAVE SEEN ALOT OF THEM. THE MOVIE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL. THE PLOT IS CONFUSING AND YOU SHOULDN'T WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING IT LIKE I DID.

3,What Holly Heard,"What Holly Heard was very exciting and always made me want to find out what was going to happen in the next chapter. The book is all about a big secret that is so private that people will go to any lengths to keep it a secret. Holly, the main character of the book, has heard of the secret and the people who started the secret know that she knows. Now they have to watch her every move, so that she doesn't tell. In this book Holly has a big crush on Noah and Noah is involved with the secret. Noah and his friends start becoming friends with Holly to make sure she doesn't tell anyone else or the people that the secret shouldn't get to. The main point of the book is what happens when the secret eventually gets out. There are so many things that can happen, it suprises some how many friends you can really have. Noah will find out about Holly's obsession and ..... Well you have to see for yourself."
5,An Excellent Book,I really liked the book What Holly Heard. It was the kind of book you never wanted to put down because you never know what was going to happen next. I thought that Ruth was Holly's bestfriend but in the end I found out that she wasn't really her firend at all. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries.
5,An Excellent Cookbook!,"This cookbook is by far one of the best cookbook for people with busy lives, who are not chefs! It is beautifully illustrated and the recipes are all fairly easy to make, just looking through the book will make you hungry and make you want to cook!I highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates easy to make yet tasty and eye-appealing dishes!"
2,Street War Stories,This is the unauthorized version of the Monster Kody War Stories doc. It is horrible quality and has the unauthorized announcement at the bottom of the screen the entire time.
1,bad quality..........,"bootleg ""for screening purposes only"" dvd. No title menu. Monster still did his thing."
4,good,"These guys bring to mind a very progressive Allman Brothers. There is lots of slide guitar and harmonica and blues structures,But they are harder, the writting is more complex--lots of turnarounds--and a funkiness that the Allmans rarely display.For 1970s hard rock, this is nothing outragious, but is definately above average."
1,Poor Substitute.,"This CD is a disapointment. None of the songs are the !2"" versions that were played in the clubs. These shortened versions are poor subtitutes that barely get you going before they end. These three to four minute versions are pointless. As well, if you want to reproduce the club experience wouldn't you mix these songs together in one long run as would have been done at any disco worth its salt?Forget this. Go and get Larry Levan Live at the Paradise Garage or West end Records 25th Anniversary Master Mix. That is unless you want a poor K-Tel Substitute."
2,Circus Disco 1981 thru 1984 memories,"The CD was a run about of the early 80's disco scene at the ever so eminent & celebrated Circus Disco. Do you recall the barrel of peanuts, your circus card for $3.00, Danny the door man, the entrance on Lexington, the Melon Balls, Oh & of course that lethal small glass brown bottle of well you know. I was 17 and entering the disco was like simply walking into a playground. What ever happened to the New Wave room in the back, Roy, Ceasar, Jeanie R., Bianca Jagger, Eva, Martha B. Judy B. and Patty C. The life & times of Circus Disco do still linger in my mind at times."
1,Did not get,I have not received this item yet. Can you tell me when or if it was delivered?Bill Hylton
5,FANTASTIC,"I'm not actually under 13-i just didnt want to bother filling out a form. anyways. Dong Bang Shin Ki is just fantastic. Love their songs. It's all very upbeat and catchy, kind of a korean boy band. And all of them are very very very good looking."
2,"Good for a quick read, but that's about it...","First of all, this is the first book I have read by Kate Clemens (the pen name of Mary Mackey)so I don't know if this is her typical writing style or not. I read the book in about two days - an easy read. Without giving too much away, the entire plot was obvious from the beginning except to all of the characters in the book. Some of the dialogue didn't seem very realistic. I often found myself thinking that actual people don't really talk like that. And the whole plot line involving Nora and her ex-husband was predictable and frankly not very interesting. I didn't really care what happened between them one way or another. This might be an okay read for a day at the beach, but if you are looking for an interesting who-done-it mystery, this isn't a good choice at all. Not only will you figure it out right away, you won't care."
4,classic Oz Man,"this CD is the Ultimate Sin! Lots of jams. especially like the song ""thank God for the Bomb (nuke em nuke em)!"" its Ozzy what more can I say!"
3,Average but enjoyable,"This album shouldn't be dismissed because Ozzy and the band embraced the horrific look of glam rock. Ozzy's nickname during this era was ""Miss Piggy"". Overweight, bad costume, tons of makeup and hairspray...good God.The songs are a bit on the light side but they still rock. This is Jake's masterpiece. His playing is unreal. Having said that there were fans back in the 80's who said Jake is better than Randy. Some reviews here say the same thing. This is beyond stupidity. Jake is awesome but he's no Randy. Randy has taken his place in rock history alongside such greats as Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, etc. Jake is not in that category. What has he done since Ozzy? Badlands? Sorry, as much as I admire his fretwork he's already been forgotten. The 80's are over people. The guitar solo is long dead. Time to embrace Nirvana and Korn."
1,Ozzy...,"Ultimate sin is an ""Ultimate Sin"". ""Shot in The dark""...classic. The rest is a repetition of one song after another. I thought my cd player was acting up. Spend a few more $$$ and get ""Essential Ozzy Osborne"". Just my opinion."
2,Osbourne Takes The Album Off,"Ozzy Osbourne is arguably one of the few true originals in rock. The key to Ozzy has always been that the man made compelling music and knew when to do something crazy off stage to keep his name in the press. Often lost, is the fact that the man is an excellent musician. However,the Ultimate Sin is not a great album for Ozzy.The album is over produced and there are few great songs on this album. Shot In The Dark and Lightning Strikes are good tunes but the album as a whole is shockingly dull. Buy this if you need it to complete your collection but if you are looking for a great Ozzy album look elsewhere."
2,"Very weak, very weak Ozzy album...","Don't make the mistake of listening to this album after listening to BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN (oh hell, BARK AT THE MOON also!). This was Ozzy's ""glam"" album. His band was dressed like Poison, and producer Ron Nevison polished the whole thing until it became slic, and slick, and a litle mor slick!The result was a flat, lifeless album, with some few good songs spread along it, but the execution really failed. Rany Castillo's drumming was no way comparable to that of Tommy Alridge or Lee Kerslake; the bass of Phil Soussan is buried, there's no way to compare it with Bob Daisley. And Jake Lee, altough very skillfull, never had a real chance to compete with Randy Rhoads's ability to play and compose.This is not a bad album by any standards (Ozzy can't do that; he and his team are too much good for it). It's jsut worst than his other albums."
1,Horrible,"This album is a complete disaster. All the songs on here suck. The best song is Shot in the Dark, which I would only give a 2/5. (The rest of the songs recieve 1/5) I guess if you like Shot in The Dark this album is for you. Just remember I warned you, don't waste your hard earned cash. Whenever I want to listen to Ozzy, I'll stick with Diary of a Madman."
2,4 Stars. REALLY?,"The fact that the ""Ultimate Sin"" has averaged 4 stars proves without a doubt that Amazon's star system cannot be trusted and is voted disproportionately by ""fans"" and not objective listeners. I was attending high school when this CornBall album was released, it sucked then and is worse now. Cheesy 80's slick hair metal,that's all. To think only 5 years after ""Diary Of a Madman""! Crazy. I've come to expect crap from the once mighty singer of Black Sabbath and frontman to Randy Rhoads (thanks sharron), a parody of himself actually, but this was the first album of his solo career that was terrible and was a sign of things to come! When such a high star rating is given to crap, the stars have lost all meaning, and if you actually think this drivel deserves 4 Stars my advise to you is.. nothing. Don't mistake nostalgia for quality, sure it reminds you of a happy time growing up? but vote with your ear."
3,a source of Some good information,"the gardening section of the book was VERY informative. i was inspired to begin my own extensive garden due to this book, and plan on following it's suggestions. however, the esoteric chapters were more than a little weak. having read many different books of magickal ""rules"", philosophies and interpretations, i found it somewhat easy to steer clear of the less founded information. the book was worth it for me nonetheless."
1,Very cheaply made...,"I bought this violin as a beginner, took it to a master violin maker and was told it was a cheaply made korean product. She explained and showed me why they are cheap, pegs will not stay in tune, the bridge isn't arched enough to allow a player to easily play all the strings without hitting the others, and my bow was so cheap is actually warps in the frog area when I tighten it, looking like it's going to break. Stay away from this product, do what i did; go to a stringed music store and buy a used violin. I got an $800 violin for $350, it isn't the prettiest but it sounds wonderful and it made learning MUCH easier!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Cecilio violins are horrible. The pegs DO NOT stay in place at all. I've spent 2 hours tuning it because these pegs constantly turn out of place in turn screwing up note sounds. Cheaply made as well. STAY AWAY seriously just got to a music store and buy 300+ dollar one it will save you the trouble, S E R I O U S L Y!!!!! not buy this crap"
1,CAN I CHANGE THIS ITEM,DEAR SIRcan i change this item because its machein made its not hand made thats y i need to change this violin.pls reply me soon thks rgdsasim
1,"Do not buy this ""instrument""","As an elementary strings teacher, I highly recommend NOT purchasing this instrument. Some families ignore the advice of teachers and purchase these instruments. They ALWAYS need repair fresh out of the box and are extremely poor quality. The pegs are painted black to look like ebony -- they do not stay in tune. The strings break pretty easily. The bridge falls off constantly. The bow is cheap, cheap, cheap.If you have a child who is interested in playing the violin, spend about $20 a month to rent a good one from a reputable music store. Very few students who have violins like this one continue playing after a year. Some might say that the instruments are fine for beginners. Far from it; they will hamper a student's progress."
2,Save your money :(,"I really wanted this violin to be as solid as it looked. Certain pieces of it are well made, such as the chin rest--solid wood, very nice. And it comes with two bows, strings, and rosin--a great deal, even though one of the bows was overtightened out of the box and rendered useless, and both bows were slightly warped. Better that it comes with two, at least!But I was disappointed to find that within less than half times of gently using this violin during lessons, the tailpiece snapped, making it unplayable. Right in the middle of a lesson, too. I have it in for repairs, to fix both the tailpiece and widen the holes for the string pegs, which are far too small according to my teacher.I would save the $100 and invest in a beginner's violin in the $400-500 range, if you're serious about becoming a student. I wish I had!"
1,Not great or even good for any amount of money,"Where to start. The Rosewood is not, it is some Chinese weed that is the color of boxwood and used to be marketed that way. It is way too soft to make pegs from, they easily go out of round and then you can't tune the instrument. They even admit that the fingerboard is painted, that is a sign of a very low quality instrument. The black paint comes off on your fingers and it makes it very difficult to resurface and almost all of this level of violin needs to have the fingerboard properly surfaced. The strings are really cheap Chinese no name brand and they sound just awful. They give you two bows because neither is any good. You will need to invest anothr $150-200 to make this instrument playable for a beginner."
3,Violin,"Looked very pretty, pkg'd well...arrived fast. Music teacher at the school can not tune it, states it will not 'hold the tune'I know nothing about violins .... gonna take it to a music store to have it properly tuned. This is my daughter's 2nd yr to play, last yr the school furnished one. New school, you rent or go go buy one. She is suppose to bring it home this weekend for us to see what we can do."
4,Delivered on time and in Good Condition,"(1) Product arrived in time, well packaged, in new, pristine condition.(2) Will need tuning, but that was expected based on reading the other reviews.(3) My 7th grade daughter was so excited to receive her item she can't wait to bring it to class next week!(4) Product is extremely light (but I've never purchased a violin before).(5) Case appears quite durable and comes with a shoulder strap which is really helpful.(6) Accessories include extra strings, rosin. Very good product for the price. Definitely recommend this."
4,Wonderful for me,"I want to start out by saying that I love my violin. It's pretty, I enjoy the happy tone it makes, and I was thrilled about how much came with it. That said however, I love many things that are not perfect. Some of the pegs slip, so taking advice from another reviewer, I made sure to buy peg drops, but there is still a fine line between having the peg slip and having it stick. If you go too far with the peg drops, you'll want peg compound. The rosin that some say is difficult to use, I had little problem with, it just needs to be ""started"" (scratched up). I bought lighter rosin elsewhere that I haven't yet been able to make work half as well. I still don't know very much about violins, so I can't describe the more technical aspects to it, but I would absolutely recommend that anyone just starting buy this violin, and get a good teacher. I would never have started to learn to play if I had to pay much more, and that makes this just plain wonderful."
4,I Think It's Great!,"My CVN-200 arrived in a reasonable time. I took it home to check it out and was simply amazed by the high quality of finish, workmanship, and overall construction. I don't play the violin; with this I will try to learn.It came with 2 bows, an extra set of strings, rosin, a tuning device, some sort of pad that I don't understand yet, and all in a really attractive case. For this price, that is astounding!I would have given it five stars, except I have no idea as to how good it is at playing and being played. But, at this price, even if I never play it, it will be an attractive monument to impulse buying, in a place of honor in my parlor."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS INSTRUMENT,"I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS INSTRUMENT. I work at a music store (I'm not trying to advertise myself or anything) and I get parents bringing these in all the time. They are horrible. The tuning pegs are never fit properly and the bridges normally need to be fitted too which is normally $40 in repairs. Without these repairs, the instrument WILL NOT STAY IN TUNE and a lot of times we refuse service because we cant guarantee the work. The tailpiece,fine tuners, and tuning pegs only fit the strings provided with them which are atrocious and super thin, so when you run out of them and go to a music store to get a standard string, they will not fit without drilling bigger wholes in the pegs and bending the fine tuners. I recommend going to your local music store and testing out violins and seeing the difference in quality. You can easily get a cheaper violin from a trusted store that can also give warranties."
1,This book fell apart,"I purchased this book after learning about it from an ad in Utne. The first part of the book was entertaining. Although it often had the academic qualities of a quiz from Cosmo, there were a few gems of insight into human behavior. It was terribly hard, however, to get past the author's overinflated opinions about her own abilities to control/influence others around her. The biggest problem with the book, however, was that it fell apart...both literally and figuratively...long before I reached the end. The binding was destroyed by the time I finished page 30, and I had to carry it around bound with a rubber band. Fortunately, the second half of the book also fell apart in terms of human interest, and I was able to give up on the scattered page hunting and throw it away."
3,It's good but BE AWARE!!,"Irving Berlin's score is absolutely fantastic. It's as fresh as the day it was written.....funny, acerbic and absorbing. Berlin was and remains a national treasure.Unfortunately, even though the performances were very good, I was disappointed to find this recording having only piano/acoustic bass (which was barely audible) arrangements. I was SOOOO looking forward to a fully orchestrated CD presentation. In addition, the piano playing was rather wimpy and with this type of thin instrumentation - that costs the CD one star.If you desperately want to hear this great score (like I did) buy this CD, but don't expect to be blown away by the production."
5,Thousands should cheer indeed!,"It is impossible to imagine a better Berlin revue! There is not a single weak link in this recording; all the singers are top-notch, great acting, immaculate comic timing, flawless singing. If Berlin is not your favourite composer, you'll be converted after this recording. If he is, then you'll still be surprised how good his songs can get if sung like this.The cast is simply wonderful. They are so flexible; can croon or swoon like a torch singer in one number, create slapstick humor the next, sound like a 50 voice choir sometimes, and reduce you to tears at others. All this achieved with just a piano and a bass! I'm particularly charmed by the relatively unknown Berlin songs such as 'How's Chances' and 'Our Wedding Day', but the high points must be 'Suppertime' and 'Harlem on my Mind'!If you already have a taste for older musicals, this is a must have. If not, sample it and discover the enjoyment it can offer as opposed to 'new' musicals."
5,wonderful!,"I agree with all the other 5 star folks - the songs are great, the singing fine. I, too, love the creaky sketch, it is for me one of the highlights of the CD. Must see if I can find a script to read more."
2,FROM GREAT MEN COME GREAT DEEDS,"This is a story about male strippers. Elvin (Elvin Bibiloni) gets evicted from his apartment. Fabian (J. Fabian) and a few guys help him move out. That is pretty much it. They encounter some problems and have flashbacks. The title comes from the drug ""G"" that they take, a liquid form of ecstasy.The stories are insulting and juvenile. The humor is coarse and immature. The film opens with a disclaimer, warning that the film is insulting to race, religion, and women who are typically called the ""C"" word. The film compares itself to South Park, but it lacks the cleverness. If you can't enough of the Howard Stern type adolescence humor, then this film is certainly for you. Hip-Hop music for much film.Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, C-word, heck the whole alphabet-word, sex, nudity."
4,Song-oriented pop with plenty of character,"Pavement's final album is probably their easiest to like. The jagged edges of their earlier sound are sanded down here by producer Nigel Godrich's heavy hand. It feels like a culmination of the band's more mellowed out style which was seen as early as Wowee Zowee and sharpened on Brighten the Corners. Not that the songwriting isn't top notch most of the time.Stephen Malkmus wrote all of the songs here, reportedly because no one else in the band had any to offer at the time. Therefore Terror plays like a showcase for Malkmus' eccentricities, for better and worse. At best it's infectious, mind-blowing and witty, everything you could want from a Stephen Malkmus record. In places however (the schmaltzy ""Major Leagues"", for example) it lacks the spontaneity, the energy, and the group effort feel which had always made Pavement such a special studio band."
2,Snore,"I'm sorry.....I love pavement, but that won't stop me from coming down on this record like a macho man elbow drop from the top of the turnbuckle. I can't knock a band for being extremely prolific, and wanting to change it's style a little bit after every 100 songs, but Brighten The Corners was Pavement turning on their blinker to leave the two lane country road that represents my musical tastes, and Terror Twilight puts them on the exit ramp. It's mellow, it's thoughtful, it's nicely produced, and it bores me to tears. Thank God for the Silver Jews."
5,glastonbury and pavement...a work of sheer art,there album once again brought rushes of energy to be carefree. a difference can be seen but unique while still maintaining their style of caprice and eccentricity. watching them at glastonbury this summer just...(speechless) their performance especially when they played cream of gold was just amazing. again they still maintain and still strive towards the old country folk mastery when they performed folk jam. summerbabe THE greatest hit too was performed a favourite for everyone in the crowd. they have truly after experiencing the crowd in glastonbury they have many and still continue to win many fans.
3,Decent swan song for seminal band hardly capitalizes on their true indie brilliance,"3 1/2Legendary alternative band's final outing was a partially successful synthesis of the cerebral pop hooks and angular sonic assaults the band had become known for. This partially succeeds only because one can hear too much strain in trying to get that synthesis correct. It was a beautiful and appropriate way to go, but Terror Twilight holds fewer compelling songs then past albums. A strong 1-2 finish brings to light the unnecessary distractions that a possibly splintering band indulged while spraying excessive off-kilter sentiment all around some of their more accessible basic melodies, and only in a determined minimalist approach guided by the haunted guitar melodies from Malkmus (The Hexx), does it seem we are once again reminded of Pavement's true genius."
2,Past their prime,"This record is in the mediocre mold of ""Brighten the Corners"" and a far cry from Pavement's glory days of ""Slanted and Enchanted"", ""Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain,"" and the ""Watery Domestic"" EP. Add ""Major Leagues"" and ""Spit on a Stranger"" to the Malkmus canon, but the rest of this disc is regrettably forgettable. Pavement's best work is, sadly, behind them."
2,... and what happened,"i know a band's in trouble when they continually talk about how satisfied they are with the direction that their music is headed (when they're interviewed). i was disappointed with ""brighten the corners"" but i was even more disappointed with ""terror twilight"". for those of you that enjoy ""terror twilight"", i envy you. i wanted to like this record. i still remember the joy that i felt when i discovered ""slanted and enchanted"", ""watery domestic"", ""crooked rain, crooked rain"" and ""wowee zowee"". i also remember the disappointment that i felt when i listened to ""brighten the corners"". something seems to have been lost, starting at that point. even though my appreciation for pavement has somewhat lessened, i still found some measure of pleasure while listening to ""spit on a stranger"". ""major leagues"", ""...and carrot rope"" had their moments as well. unfortunately, the best i can say about this work is that it contained one song that i'd look forward to hearing time and again."
2,I'm sad.,Is that a standard tuned guitar i hear? Who are these guys and what have they done with Pavement?
3,Some magic here...,"Well ""the Hexx"" is Pavement at it's best. This was the first song I heard of the album and based on that felt this very well could be the best album since ""Slanted"" - as Malkmus tends to think. Sadly no. The rest turned out to be reasonably devoid of the interesting ideas I expect from my Pavement records. There are a few magical moments in the rest of the work but on the whole I am disappointed. And I don't buy the media hype about what Nigel did to the sound - if anything the lyrics are really hard to hear - a big no no. I don't think this album will stand up long term. Looking forward to seeing the new material live - I suspect it will come over a lot better. Still one of my favourite bands..."
5,Pavements Best Album Ever!,After repeat listenings of Terror Twilight and then comparison listenings of other pavement albums it is clear that their songwriting has matured for the better. The songs on Terror Twilight are more complex and interesting as well as better produced than any other Pavement. This alnum makes Crooked Rain sound like a demo for a high school band. Terror Twilight mixes sounds and genres into what is definitely Pavement's most accomplished album to date.
5,Mmmmmmmmalkmus,"I don't even like this the way I like most albums. I like it the way I like water on a hot day. To hear it is a relief. Like proof that not everyone is either stupid or pathological. Myslef included. For sure. Terror Twilight is so perfect that no other words really come to mind. It's not invigorating or stimulating or soothing or sexy or tight or dope or any other cliche. It's just excellent music. If you like to hear music that is original. smart and instantly familiar, you might like this a lot!"
5,block rockin beats,"Once again back is the incredible P. Pavement is number 1 in my books for the way they make me feel. Isn't that music after all? With sounds and words, the artist can make one feel as they did or would. Pavement makes me feel a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll all at the same time. And on this album, one can tell how the songs will sound just from their title. Except for Spit on a Stranger that is. The song is much nicer than the title. I would have called the song ""loogie on a fellow plebian"" though. Hey, to each their own."
3,Shocked by the breadth of rhythm on this,"Shocked by the breadth of rhythm on this disk. It almost sounds like the music they play at Sea World during those cheerleading championships. My favorite part is during Carrot Rope, an almost entirely insturnmental song, when the singer chants ""give it out, give it up."" Much different from other Pavement recordings, given that they recently fired their drummer Gary and used Balinese drummers on certain tracks instead."
5,oh yeah,"i would just like to say i play some of the drums on this cd, and tamborine, and the nocks on the door! i love this band i got drum lessons from steve west (the drummer) they are grrrrrreat"
1,This album is boring.,"This album is so boring that I've completely lost interest in the band. Brighten the Corners was weak, too. Neither album has the energy and wit of Wowee Zowee and the others before it. These slackers are really slacking it. For all the accolades bestowed on Malkmus, he doesn't hold a candle to Beck. Time to pack it in, dude, and buy that maraschino cherry farm."
3,Too Fluffy,"This is as bad as it gets for Pavement. It's too girly and touchy feely. They really started to come off the tracks with this one. The magic is gone on this effort. Still... it's Pavement, which makes it better than most of the other stuff out there."
3,malkmus is an absolute genious,"Malkmus is a genious. This however is not his best work. His debut solo album is one of the best things he's ever done, pick that up before this. His Pig Lib is pretty great also, definately stronger than this. I continue to be amazed at the stuff this guy comes up with. There is no one else doing this. His lyrics and music are as insane as ever. I met him after a show at a bar and he's really quiet and introverted (at least he was that night) and you wonder where this music comes from. I put him up there with Westerberg as far as songwriting talent goes. When it comes down to it, there are 2 great songwriters the history of music : Malkmus and Westerberg."
3,Please don't go full blown radio/commercial,"From what I've heard it sounds a bit mellow. I heard it was geared a little bit more towards radio play. I hope there are still the shrieking screams and revolving guitar riffs. Im sure it will be no disappointment, how could it when every single pavement CD is incredible. Cant wait."
2,Overproduced Pop in a Straightjacket,"Loved the ""new"" Pavement of Wowee and BTC, but not this. Buy the Spit on a Stranger EP instead. The five songs there (two of which were recorded in 1996) outdo everything on Terror Twilight (except for the title song, of course)."
2,What happened to Pavement?,"I know I haven't heard the album yet, but I doubt that most of the people who have reviewed this have heard the whole thing either. However, from the sound samples, I can tell that Pavement continues to go downhill, sliding towards radio-playability. ""Spit on a Stranger"" sounds like a bad Beatles rip off, and ""Major Leagues"" is pathetic. My advice is to stick with ""Westing (By Musket and Sextant"") and ""Slanted and Enchanted""--they are masterpieces. Pavement has gone downhill since then. It's sad, but at least they produced two incredible albums worth of material."
4,Fascinating,"I picked up this book on a whim, and found myself fascinated by the science. Its about the threat of comets and asteroids and the potential of collision with earth. If you are concerned, you should be, especially if the projectile is large and lands in the sea- deadly Tsunamis and tidal waves could be the result....look what happened to the dinosaurs! LOL, actually, the threat of being hit by a much smaller rock is far greater, Earth is hit every year by many small objects which most people never see or are noticed, (except by science-types).This book covers historical, ancient, and modern perspective towards the stellar apparitions. While parts are a little dry, it's a good read for science geeks, or those interested in learning about asteroids and meteors. I found the author's occasional witty commentary funny, and the historical notes fascinating. An excellent, read all-around. 4 stars."
1,Stolen works of Immanuel Velikovsky and then trashes him,"This author has stolen the foundational idea of this book from the great scientist Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky who wrote the best seller ""Worlds in Collision"" in 1950. Then this author, Verschuur, trashes Velikovsky. Verschuur states hackneyed cliches about Velikovsky that were part of the most disgusting scientific blackballing in history. Verschuur does not address all of the overwhelming evidence that NASA has devoped over the last 40 years which were all anticipated by Velikovsky. What about the 900 degree surface temperature of Venus, or radio signals from Jupiter, or thick dust on the moon (remember the footprints of our astronauts?), or the scores of other discoveries all of which Velikovsky clearly anticipated and Verschuur ignores while promoting his own daffy theory. As an objective writer, Verschuur is a failure, and as an observer of alternative science he is lame."
2,An assorted collection of almost useles stuff,"I have owned this kit for about 3 months. You get a cheap cassette adapter to connect your jukebox to a car with a cassette player. This is not different from any cheap car adapter you get at your local pharmacy. You also get a power adapter for the car - this is also a general voltage adapter which plugs into the cigarette lighter adapter. You get another cheap pair of headphones similar to the ones that shipped with your Jukebox. About the only useful thing is the remote control which is of moderate use if you place your jukebox in a place that is inconvenient to reach directly when driving. It seems like a useful collection but in the end I only find myself using the power and cassette adapter. Then again, its not that expensive. Just do not expect too much or good quality - this is cheap aftermarket stuff."
1,The product that doesn't exist,"The vendor took my money and failed to ship the product. The dealer didn't notify me that the product was unavailable, and no refund was sent or offered until I specifically wrote and asked what happened."
1,A collection of overpriced junk.,"Unless you really need the remote don't buy this junk. Even the remote is pretty useless. It has a two foot cord on it which begs me to ask the question ""Couldn't you just as easily use the buttons on the player?"" It also doesn't have a clip on it so if you're thinking of attaching it to something you best be prepared to slap some velcro on it. The cassette adapter is useless. I don't even know anyone with a cassette deck in their car anymore. The headphones are crap unless you like listening to just treble. No bass response at all. Turn the bass up on the player and you're listening to sweet overpowering distortion. The stereo cable can easily be found somewhere else. The car power adapter is a cheap, underpowered universal type. You'd be better off buying a 9v radio shack adapter with more mah."
2,Eh....,The parts are extremely thin and the metal doesn't feel very durable. I was fiddling with these for just a few minutes. The parts are so small which make solving the puzzles very difficult. I was not satisfied with this product.
3,Fun little puzzles,"The puzzles are fun... but the solutions are on the back, so you don't really have to work at them. And they are kind of cheap looking... really small puzzles!"
5,Fun Gift,I bought this for a co workers birthday and he loved them all. took him about a hour to solve them all but he cheated and looked at the solutions on the back. they are made very sturdy but will bend if given to someone with a short temper.
2,another humorous Anthony Newman cd,"This cd is a nice collection of music for the organ. It includes Liszt, his premiere student, Reubke, and the usual French organ suspects.His tempi is always faster than normal. I have concluded he is challenging the boring ""funeral parlor"" image of the trudging organ sound that filled so many a people's minds and previous associations with organ music. This is all fine and dandy, but his music lacks soul, expression, and musical sense, not to mention acoustical considerations of the space.He's clearly well trained and has played a lot of rep, but I feel as if he's played this rep too much to the point where it is a mechanical action rather than a special event in his quotidian routine.If you want to hear agitated and lightning speed recordings of this music, by all means, buy it. If you want good organ playing, buy another recording."
4,An Underground Classic,"After forming in 1978, this was Fishbone's first release. Forget about the short ska phase the music scene went through back in 98-99 - Fishbone was doing it WAY before with this album. And it's not just ska; it's fun, raw, energetic, and humorous rock. ""Party At Ground Zero"" has historically prooved the success of this album. You've probably heard it on the radio or in the background of some television show or movie. The same can be said of Fishbone - they've lingered just under the nose of mainstream rock and roll (which is probably better for the longevity of the band). People new to Fishbone will probably like this album or ""Truth and Soul"" best. But this is one party album that belongs in everyone's upbeat collection."
2,"Blob, Blob, Blob","It writes overhead, on oil and water, it flows nicely, has a nice color but it blobs every time I use it. By the time I'm finished writing a check or note it's full of ink smears. It's not just this one, they're all like that, they all smear and blob. I have a drawer full of Fisher ink refills that blob. I've had to retire the Fisher pen because of this."
2,The Case of the Howling Dog,"This book was listed in good condition. When received I discovered that a page was torn off in one corner, and the front cover came off as my husband was reading it. This is not what I call ""good"" condition."
3,Has its benefits,"This product is a different than advertised. It doesn't really work as well as described, but it has its uses. You can still benefit from using it, but the quality of shooting on target is extremely difficut to manage as the ball bag slows the ball down considerably making your shot difficult to judge on its power and accuracy. Nontheless, I've managed to tailor it to work well enough for it to be worth keeping."
4,Kick Medic,"This is a useful product for practicing kicking, especially in a small space such as a small back yard. As another reviewer noted, the net bag does slow down the flight of the ball, but the extra resistance probably helps develop power. The DVD does not provide good instruction for kicking the ball, and there are far better videos for teaching the development progression of kicking, and how to master each stage (backswing, foot placement, foot position, angle of deflection, parts of the foot, follow through, head position, etc.). This product is worthwhile because of the repetitions you can get in a small space, but not because of the video. The product is very easy to use and set up."
1,"Quality of ""Absolution""","I was very disappointed by the photographic quality of the images. The story itself may have been good, especially since Richard Burton was the lead actor. But the images were poor. PMD"
3,Green peas make green pasta,Not a bad video but has two awful performances with one terrible music score. After watching this I immediately put the tape in the toilet and tried to flush it down but it clogged it up and then it overflowed. That tape has been giving me problems ever since I began using it. Otherwise it is an okay piece not worth $1.50.
5,Substantive and useful; not pop-psychology,"Too many books on this topic are pop-psychology -- written to be easily consumed without much thought and with promises of quick results. This book is more thorough, but not quite academic, in exploring this issue, its causes and its remedies. It digs beneath the surface of the issues and doesn't gloss over them in breezy, Oprah-style soundbites."
5,Get This Book,"As someone who has been in group therapy for a while, I must say this is a terrific book. What I like about it is that it is not a ""self-help,"" feel good book. The book doesn't necessarily tell us anything we don't already know. But it crystallizes things with astonishing lucidity. Get this book--and share it with your partner. Talk about it in bed."
2,My expectations too high,"While I have the ultimate respect and admiration for Margie Goldstein-Engle, I was extremely disappointed in reading this book. Written on a third grade reading level, it was more about her mother's pride in her daughter, than how Margie overcame obstacles. True, it did tell of her perserverance against many ""hurdles"" that stood in her way. However, I had expected a more personal account of what Margie thought and specifics about what she did to improve her riding skills, how she adjusted her riding to compensate for her size, how she paid for horse shows early in her riding, etc. This book did not meet the hurdle of my expectations, but my respect for Margie Goldstein-Engle remains high. I will save this as a gift for one of the very young riders at our barn."
3,Read the Chronicle instead,"Mom, who is rightfully proud of her daughter, is a retired schoolteacher, and boy does it show. To say the book was written on a third grade reading level, which another reviewer has claimed, is completely accurate. The corny, quoted dialogue that supposedly takes place between mother and daughter reads like an elementary school play: ""How did the grand prix go?"" ""Very well, thank you. I got first, second and fourth."" ""That's wonderful. How do you feel about the Olympic outcome?"" This would be a delightful read for a preteen that aspires to be a top rider, but it's merit ends there. If you want to follow Margie's career, but a subscription to the Chronicle of the Horse instead."
2,Not for adults,"This would be interesting reading for a young rider. I expected explanations and descriptions about how Margie achieved her successes. Instead, it is more like her mother's walk down Memory Lane. It might be fine for a young fan of Margie's, but it is not for a mature, serious rider. I also do not understand why the Kelso family review was repeated and included twice in averaging the rating."
4,A determined young woman,"I have read ""No Hurdle Too High"" and thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought that the author by choosing to write it from a third person, objective point of view, as a parent, as opposed to Margie-Engle Goldstein's first person, subjective, point of viewwas the author's prerogative. And by using this approach, she made the book intriguing and heart-warming. Either approach, if used would have satisfied some people and left others unhappy.The book conveys a good sense of the difficulties (hurdles0 that Margie faced and conquered. The purpose of the book, I believe, was to learn not about the technicalities of Horse Jumping, but to tell Margie's story it more personal and less technical.I found it very inspiring and recommend it strongly.Herb"
3,Best of this band,"This is the best album this band ever made, and that isn't saying much. To describe how this thing sounds isn't so easy, but let me try....OK, I have it. This should be classified as Bubble-gum Rock.You can chew it and chew it and never get anywhere. Understand?I am sure many teens shed tears while these songs were performed live, but something tells me this was a waste of a great singer.The notes go as high as any have ever gone, yet there is little to back them up. Just looking at the song titles will tell you enough;YOUR LOVE-- EVERYTIME YOU CRY-- ALL THE LOVE-- TALK TO ME--- I DON'T NEED HER--This is bad poetry at best, yet the talent here was able to make it sound decent. If only they had spent more time on some real songs, words that grab you.Looks though like they wanted to grab other things apparently.....This is great for girls, others be cautious. 3 stars is being generous here...."
4,"Great music, but needs remastering","Thoroughly enjoyable album, a few weak tracks but otherwise this sounds like an album The Police might have made and been quite proud of. But I'm knocking off one star (was tempted to knock off two stars) because the sound quality should be much better. I had this on vinyl years ago, and that was so much better sounding than this. The CD here almost sounds like it was recorded from an LP to cassette, and transferred from that cassette to CD. Someone needs to go back to the original tapes and create a remastered CD worthy of this music."
3,"Interesting topic, content a bit low","The premise of this book is a year in the life of a great restaurant at a time when the pressure is on to get a fourth star from the NYT food critic. Sounds pretty good, huh? Well, it really isn't.Good things can be found here; for example culinary nuggets scattered through the book about how to cook bacon, prepare citrus zest etc are interesting and useful. A glimpse at the business side of the restaurant is novel but underdeveloped.My major criticisms are three...I didn't get to know Daniel Boulud at all. Many opportunities to flesh him out were missed...there are a zillion frequently seen people in the kitchen, but most are so undeveloped that I couldn't keep 'em straight....There is far too much random kitchen chatter reproduced. It is mostly a distraction and is thoroughly boring. ""Fire 35...merde! zut alors! putain!"""
5,Five Stars for The Fourth Star,"I loved this book--and I'm not even a ""foodie!"" The Fourth Star reads like a well-crafted novel, with great characters, intricate relationships, and delicious tidbits about who gets what table, about the frenzied goings-on behind the kitchen door, and about what it's like when the President of the United States shows up at your restaurant for a meal. It's full of information I never realized I wantd to know, such as where the staff buys their stylish but extra-comfortable shoes, what the restaurant mark-up is on a bottle of water, how the timing works so that all the entrees arrive at the table at the same time, and just what goes into making a sublime dish. It's a fascinating read. I'd recommend this book to anyone."
2,Interesting but frustrating,"Lots of interesting details about running a high quality restaurant in New York, but overall the content is a bit thin. The book is very padded with many blow by blow accounts of a typical dinner or lunch service at Daniel. It's interesting the first few times or when the author recounts a dinner for President Clinton, but by the tenth dinner you begin to flip the pages. I was disappointed that there was almost no insight into Daniel Boulud, how he and his staff create new dishes, what actions he took to elevate the restaurant to 4 stars or what really sets his restaurant apart from other top quality restaurants in the US. The nugget for a good book is here, but I think the author skimped on her research and simply transcribed her tape recordings from a year of standing in the kitchen."
3,Interesting even if you're not a chef.,Enjoyed the book and I'm no chef. I actually bought it for business purposes (consulting with a restaurant owner) and found it great on customer service and the ins and outs of restaurant managment. It made me hungry simply reading about the fabulous food. Easy and quick read with interesting personal stories.
3,The good and the bad,"I would not recommend this for true ECW fans due to the December to Dismember PPV sucking, but I would recommend you get the other videos at the regular price. I have all of the ones but the Van Dam video and D2D. I've seen the Van Dam video and it's pretty sweet so I really think if you are a WWE fan and you want the true feeling of ECW, it's the way to go."
5,I Passed,I just passed my PMP and don't think I would have without this book. I literally crammed for my exam. I was having a very hard time digging through the PMBOK and this book sorts it out by project phases vs. knowledge areas which I found very helpful. I will be sharing my copy with all my friends who are studying for the PMP.
4,PMP Exam Prep at its best,"The 1st time I took the PMP exam, I only studied the PMBOK and I missed passing by one point. After studying the PMP Exam Cram, I passed with flying colors. It has all the pertinent informatin without any of the fluff!"
4,Great preparation assist for the PMP exam,"I used this book, the related PMP Practice Questions Exam Cram 2 and the PMBOK to prep for the exam. Exam Cram 2 added some life to the (for me) dreadfully dull PMBOK content and did a pretty good job of highlighting important aspects of the PMBOK that would be featured in the exam. It also covered topics that are tested but have little coverage in the PMBOK (for example, Professional Responsibility and ""fishbone"" diagrams). I did a lot of going back and forth between EC2 and PMBOK.The test questions CD was also useful, enough so that I decided to spring for ""PMP Practice Questions Exam Cram 2"". For me, I think the questions forced me to really think in depth about how PMI views the many aspects of project management. I doubt I would have passed without them."
2,Not so hot,Not as wonderful as expected. Simple interface is more for the very young child. Nice graphics and very easy to use storyline but way to simple for my 3rd grader.
4,"A good book, but lacking the usual something.",Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years is a good book but it seems to have lost the underlying realism of the earlier diaries. The humour just dosen't seem quite as good and Adrian just does too badly. Having said that he has to grow up and the book is very much an Adrian Mole diary. If you are addicted to the previous diaries then I would definetly buy this book.
2,A disapointment,I loved the other Mole Diaries but i found the wilderness years to be depressing. Adrian is pathetic and no longer so witty.
3,Adrian Mole is a little less annoying,"Adrian Mole, erstwhile novelist and self-styled intellectual, returns for a fourth installment of his diaries.While the first 3/4 of this book was more or less filled with the same whining naivety of the preceeding volume of this series, I was pleased with the final quarter in which Adrian seems to finally be growing up. Not a moment too soon. I am now vindicated in having purchased the entire series and am looking forward to the next volume."
5,kiwi music rules,Great lyrics and foot tapping feel about itI've seen Kokomo live and they're just Great!songs cover from the subjects of lost love to riding trains across Australia and the undergrounds of London.they're in full on Tracies dotcom site.If ya like upbeat bluesy stuff then add this one to your collection
2,Has lost what made him truely different.....trying to fit in,"Mac was the best of the best....a writers writer. He still has the voice and the guitar ability but he's trying to conform to industry standards instead of setting them. What happen to songs like "" opinon on love"", lyrics like...""Barney came to the gossip bench and said I bar b q'd a dog , on a tractor axile yesterday down at the dump yard"". Get away from Buffett he's wasn't in your league."
3,Too-long gap between albums may have affected this fan...,"I love listening to Mac. His voice is a much deeper, more pleasant, and much friendlier ""version"" of James Taylor. So I was looking forward to this, his first new album in years. Unfortunately, the long gap between releases may have heightened my expectations unrealistically. I've felt only disappointment with ""Word of Mouth"". To my ears, Mac still sounds as great as ever, but many of the songs on the CD sound better suited for others. Jimmy Buffett is an obvious influence (I'm betting that the very lame ""The Ass and the Hole"" is a staple at Buffett concerts), Carly Simon would cover ""Against the Odds"" like nobody's business... But there are very few ""Mac"" songs for my taste (""Just One Forever"" and ""Pop Top Hop"" are about the only ones to have that ""Mac"" touch). Still... Mac needs to sell as many CDs as possible, so I'm not saying 'don't buy this...' Just keep it in perspective as one of his not-so-great efforts!"
5,I'm Gonna Miss Diane,"I love Cheers. Its my favorite show of all time! The Diane years are my favorite. But the seasons after her departure are classic too, don't get me wrong, but i think Cheers is at its best with Diane. This is her final season, and boy, did she leave it with a bang. An absolutely classic show, and yet another phenominal season of Cheers on dvd. There are too many classic episodes to name, but here's a couple, when Sam councils Dianes' reservations at that expensive restaurant, and takes his date there instead. Hilarious! And when the dog bites Cliff, and he thinks she really likes him, but of course she is just trying to get out of being sued by Cliffie. A laugh riot! There are atleast like 15 more I can think of, but I can't list them all here. I got the first 4 seasons the day they came out, and I'm gonna get the 5th season the day it comes out as well."
5,Cheers-Season Five,"If Shelley Long was the CAKE to Cheers the first four seasons, then Kirsty Alley was certainly the FROSTING starting with season FIVE."
5,Another great Cheers season!,"What can I say? If you like this kind of humor, Cheers is as good as it gets. All good episodes!"
2,Didn't work for me,"I'm an old fart and I bought a 2 month supply because the ingredients were reported to increase testosterone which helps to reduce ""belly fat"". Well, I still have my fat, and the label on the bottle implies that it will also improve ""bedroom"" performance. That didn't work either. Perhaps I'm just too old, but it didn't work for either purpose at all for me. If you're younger, you might want to give it a try. If it works for you, fine. But I won't be ordering more."
1,no difference,I took the tablets everyday until I had finished the product. I noticed absolutely no difference. I was very disappointed based on the reviews I had read before I placed my order.
5,effective supplement for recovery,"About an hour after I took one pill the muscles in my arms felt huge, a couple hours later my libido kick in. The 20:1 ratio seems to work for workouts. It's a little expensive but I'm happy with the purchase."
1,Wrong part for 2003,This is the wrong part for a 2003 SportTrac. The correct part number for a 2003 is SW5928.Correct Switch for 2003http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C5DUN2/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00
2,Not The Right Part!!!!,Ordered this part because it said it was the right one for my 2003 Sport Trac....WRONG!Looked at the ones others ordered and found the right part by looking at the pictures...seems that the 2002 Ford Sport Trac part works on my 2003....
1,"lWrong part, does not work on 2005 Ford Sporttrac","This product was listed to fit 2005 sport trac and is the wrong part will not work, I called the local ford dealer and his said this was for the explorer only not the sportrac."
1,Wrong part,"Although Amazon.com website said it was the correct part, it is not the correct switch for my 2005 Ford Sport Trac. Giving it one star really isn't the proper thing to do as the switch may be perfect when installed on vehicles it was manfactured for."
1,Broke,Bracelet broke the minute i put it on! And ive been trying to email them to tell them and ask if i can send it back and get a new one and its been two weeks now and i havent gotten a reply yet!!!
2,Nice,"The bracelets are nice.. Didn't break when i put them on.. They are stretchy and would match with any outfit. I love them except they kind of look like they are meant to be worn by a little kid...****After wearing the bracelt the first day I had it, I came home and took it off and it broke to pieces!!*****"
5,Elegant doorbell,This is a great doorbell. Elegant and functional. Installation was a bit costly as I had to replace the siding by the front door so the ugly holes from the previous doorbell didn't show. I installed the Fleur de Lis in the front and the Palm Tree at the back door. I have gotten compliments on both. I recommend this doorbell.
1,Don't DO THIS!,"Ear Candling is a hoax! I bought a few of them from my chiropractor's office. I did one in my ear and then I did the 2nd one just sitting on the palm of my hand. The results were the same. The residue is burned wax, not ear wax. Don't waste your money."
1,Please don't waste your money,"The book, ""Family Slaughter"" is a collection of stories about families who were murdered. Don't waste your money. You'll have a tough time reading it. You've been warned."
4,Subtle in its potency,"This book centers on Marnus, who's living in South Africa in the 1970s. His father is an Afrikaaner general, and Marnus parrots his family's beliefs on race, religion, and class, until a visit from a Chilean general to his family's house for a week forces Marnus to several realizations about his country, his family, and himself. By telling the story from Marnus's young viewpoint, Behr creates a fascinating portrait of apartheid in South Africa, and of the reality of whites there who are blind to their own cruelties. The reader is drawn into making her/his own decisions about the various hypocritical statements. This story is ultimately about the loss of innocence. Behr also weaves flashforwards about Marnus fighting in the Angolan war in the early 1980s, showing us the future effects. A searing and vivid story that brings the reader further and further in until it's impossible to leave without knowing how it ends."
2,"can we say ""heavy handed""?","I only gave this book two stars cause it's written by a friend of a friend. but... for one thing I'm not even sure what happened in the book. (spoiler) is Dad supposed to be a ... lover of the Chilean general/child molester??!? That seems to be what's vaguely and senselessly implied. And I mean, ok, he's a hypocrite, Dad is, then. I'm sorry I didn't get this book at all. And the style and the conceit of this little boy who just accepts everything Daddy says without question.... I found a really tough ""buy""..."
4,Apartheid as seen by a child,"The novel, set in South Africa during the 1970s, relates the story of an Afrikaans family through the eyes of the narrator, Marnus Erasmus. Marnus is a child of the white, brutal culture and the system of the apartheid. He lives a seemingly happy life, influenced by his father, who is a general in the South African army. Against a background of racial prejudices, the reader gets to know the reality of the Erasmus family, including the sexual molestation of Marnus's best friend (Frikkie) by his father and an love-affair between his mother and a visiting Chilean general. Although I found the novel's shocking ending less than credible, the gradual uncovering of the enormous pressures on this family gives this novel a brooding tension.Mark Behr has created a lyrical and memorable child narrator, along with a really great background-story."
2,Sizes are too small,"I bought a pair of ADULT M knee guards, but they seem to be youth size. I think that even the ADULT L are too small."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS MERCHANT,"I ordered this shirt as a gift for my husband. It was due to arrive between sept. 27- oct. 5. Guess what? I received an email from Amazon (today, oct. 5) that said that ElectricKID has not confirmed my order. So I emailed them and told them to cancel my order. I will NEVER order from them again!! BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Above the fray,"NBC has done an exceptional job documenting the imbeds' experience in Iraq. Not only was this war covered more comprehensively than any other, but the reporters' experiences add a depth of human emotion so often lacking in the dry stand up reports from a briefing room. But their story is just one part of a beautifully produced book and DVD. This book is filled with stunning pictures of ""shock and awe"" as well as the innocents caught in the middle. If you only get one book on the recent war in Iraq, this is it!Follow-up 2012...this book really stinks, just like the war. I just said the book was good 'cause a friend worked on it."
4,The best picture book about the 2003 War with Iraq.,"Of all the picture books about the 2003 War with Iraq, this is probably the best. It has a little more meat than the other books, and the book goes into detail from the GI's perspective. I have read a number of these books, and this is perhaps the best. All of these books have great pictures, but there is little writing of substance in each of them. This one has a little more traction and substance.Several pages were devoted to David Bloom, the reporter who had a heart attack in Iraq. His live coverage was great, but the book paints him as a cut above the other reporters and NBC above the other news organizations. Other than this publicity, the book is well thought out and gives a detailed picture of the three operation to overthrow Saddam Hussein. This is a nice picture book and an above average read."
1,Bazooka is better,"I just finished reading Achilles' Heel by Sean Flannery. Can I get a refund? Flannery may have been a good cryptographer in the Air Force, but, because someone is good at one profession doesn't make them good at another. It's like an actor trying to run for the presidency. The writing is just awful. Flannery's description of the people in this book are practically nil, and conversation between characters puts them around the third grade level. Combine that with a story line that is absurd leaves a book that should never have been published! Who are the people reading this book? Is this the reason that SAT scores are so low in America? This is not literature! I've read bubble gum wrappers with more substance than this!"
2,Two dimensional characters spoil military thriller.,"A thiller about a stolen Russian sub being transported to the Cubans is not a bad one. However, these are some of the worst characters around. The lead character is so cocky as to be annoying. His Russian opponent is totally two dimensional. He is evil; nothing more. The British head of staff is so predictably annoying as to become tiresome. Since everyone else seems to be comparing this book to Tom Clancy's, I'll point out one big difference. Tom Clancy's characters are realistic. These are just annoying."
5,Excellent! Riveting! Emotional!,"The Visit is an excellent film about choices, family, love, forgiveness, and understanding. The story is told through an original mix of flashbacks, dreams, and the present. This well written, beautifully shot and wonderfully acted independent film is the reason that I have always and will continue to support independent films. I highly recommend the Visit."
4,It's not prison that locks one up...,This movie was GREAT and Hill Harper is a fine actor as well as a fine specimen!
2,Disapointed Fan,"I am so dissapointed in this film. When I saw it at the store I bought it right away because of Billy Dee and Hill Harper. But I gotta tell you, The movie never went anywhere. I Thought that there would be more scenery, but it was Just the prison. I hate to tell you the movie, if you hadn't already seen it but, The end is the only plot that actually make the movie interesting. By then I really hated that I sat there 107 min for only 2 or 3 interesting scenes.Was it just me or did it seem that Hill Harper was trying to act like Denzel did in Hurricane?"
5,Focuses upon the personal struggle of 10 year old Ann Marie,"Grand prize winner of the 2003 Writer's Digest International Self-Published Book Award, Small As A Mustard Seed by Shelli Johnson is a superbly crafted and reader engaging novel which focuses upon the personal struggle of 10 year old Ann Marie to understand and deal with her father's mental illness which have their origins in the trauma of his service in the Korean War. When Ann Marie returns home after an absence of 26 years she must continue to deal with issues that not only divided the family of her childhood, but influenced and affected each family member's future -- including her own. Author Shelli Johnson draws upon her experience and expertise as an award-winning journalist and short-story writer in her debut effort as a full-length novelist to create believable characters in complex familial relationships of struggle, strength, vulnerability, and hope. Simply put, Small As A Mustard Seed is a terrific read from first page to last."
4,"If you read anything this summer, it should be this book!","I bought the book yesterday upon recommendation from a friend, read it on the bus ride home, in between cooking dinner, and finished it this afternoon. It is a heart-wrenching story about family, siblings, grief and forgiveness. The writing is vivid and stirring. An excellent read!"
5,Mental Disease . . . It is worse on all the people who are exposed to it.,Beautiful writing. Ms. Johnson is a wordsmith. She tells the story of the Adler family whose husband and father is mentally ill. The family are the ones who suffer more than him. The family has the permanent scars that mar their lives. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well-written sad tale.
5,This book moved me profoundly.,"A powerful and beautifully personal book. It touched me deeply. A story of people and their struggles and hopes. Simply beautiful.The story grows quietly, and taking you by the hand, allows you a view into a private world of hope against hope.I look forward to the next book by Shelli Johnson."
4,Amazing Novel!!!,"I didn't read the summary before I started this book, so I wasn't sure what I was getting into. This book turned out to be incredible. Its not something that I wouldn't usually read, but from the minute I started I just couldn't put it down. The first chapter just captured me completely. It is emotionally gripping with characters so real. Ann Marie was the character I connected with most. Always holding emotions inside. She had to carry so much grief, and eventually had to learn to let it go. Go find a nice comfy spot before you start this book, because you will not want to put it down until its finished. A story full of struggle, heartache, faith and forgiveness. Small as a Mustard Seed was such a powerful novel, one that I'm so glad to have read."
3,"Good function, questionable reliability","This DVD player has been quite good when it works. We had to return it to JVC for repair within the first year but, to their credit, they did repair it free of charge."
1,CRAP service and CRAP device,"DO NOT BUY JVC PRODUCTS!! My unit did not work properly from the outset and I spent weeks trying to get it serviced. Terrible service and the VCR portion of the machine is defective. additionally, the DV input (ieee port) was loose and all my DV dubs got messed up. NEVER AGAIN with this lousy company"
1,JVC Will Fix This Unit For Free,"I had the ""loading"" problem and sent this unit back to my retailer for replacement. The replacement unit had the same problem and did not perform according to specs at all. JVC should never have let this unit out to be sold to consumers. After a lot of hassle and calls to my retailer and JVC, I finally found out that JVC will fix this unit for free. I sent it to the JVC authorized service center in MA. They fixed it and sent it back in only three days. So far it has performed great since being fixed. If this fix sticks I would rate this unit four stars instead of one star....we'll see...Tom in CT"
3,Peca TV301 Techni Valve for DP612,"Very nice piece, BUT be careful not to lose the *O ring as it sits in there loosely."
5,ABSOLUTLY THE GREATEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN,THERE IS NOT MUCH TO SAY THIS BOOK IS JUST SO GOOD AND THE CHARACTERS ARE SO WELL DEVLOPED THAT THIS BOOK IS JUST ABOUT PERFECT
5,Excellent. Highly recommended.,"This is an excellent fantasy story about a young orphan boy named Pug.Pug is taken in by an old Magician and sets about to learn the ways of Magic. But somehow, he never progresses very far.Then it is learned that Pug has an incredible power within himself, as yet untouched, unknown. It is a mystery for theold magician. I haven't read a whole lot of Fantasy, but this is the best yet. I highly recommend it."
5,A page-turner.,"This book is good. I am very busy right now, and yet I read both books in two weeks! I would get home by 10 and keep reading past midnight. I got a reference to this book in one of Peter Hamilton's books, and I'm glad I did. A great book."
5,"This is a very heart touching book, I have loved","Magician: Apprentice opened me up to a whole new world of fantasy. With R.E.F (Raymond E Feist) talent for making characters you can feel for( Pug and Tomas) and having them develop is a rare quality in a great Author. And in this book you will not only enjoy the several action scenes, but also you shall enjoy the things of everyday life. For in R.E.F books just watching the characters grow is enough of a storyNicholas R. Furey"
3,"Solid fantasy storytelling, but lacks spice","""Magician"" was the first fantasy book I've ever read in English and I found it quite a page-turner the first time around. The world of Midkemia may not be terribly original, but I enjoyed the way Feist describes it's races, politics, cultures in many great details to make the place ""real"" for the reader, and the very complex plot kept me interested throughout. Unfortunately, once finished the book and the series didn't make me want to go back for a repeat reading and I doubt they ever will. Much of it has to do with Feist's rather flat and mundane prose, and his characters which, with few exceptions, are just not very engaging or interesting. Thus the books are lacking certain something; an extra pinch of ""oomph"" or a sparkle to make them great. As they are, they are merely good and certainly worth a visit, just don't expect something extraordinary."
5,A great read for even the blind,"This book is wonderfully writen. It spins a story of two keep boys, Pug and Tomas. And the changes they go through in there adolences. It is a story of compasion, goodhearted nature, and Two nations drawn together in war."
2,ehh.,"I was disappointed. I could not identify with the main characters, who are teenage boys with associated teenage angst, teenage romance and immature world views -- therefore, I had trouble caring about them or what happened to them. Likewise, the world that was created was >ehh< not particularly interesting or engaging -- yeah, a couple of dwarfs, some elves, a few ""dark folk"" that are thrown in -- but they don't really enhance the plot. And, worst of all, the enemy never comes across as evil, but instead seem to invade just because they need reasources -- kind of hard to really hate them. Boring, boring, boring, boring. Had trouble finishing the book. Yech.In contrast, I really enjoyed Dark Moon by Gemmel and also enjoyed The Stolen Child"
3,Disappointing Fantasy for Children,"This reminded me of reading the Black Cauldron as a child -- don't ask me why.I bought this because I loved Faierie Tale so much.I love scifi and fantasy, so this seemed like the perfect book. Plus, I'd heard so many good things about it. But, it just didn't do it for me.Sorry."
2,predictable!!!,"I started reading this series with one of my friend's advice..I do not want to be overly critical but I just did not like the first two books, then quit reading the series. the main problem about the book is the storytelling. the dialogues are dull and childish, the storyline is sooooo much predictable. on every page of this book someone makes some silly mistake and apologise for it..the whole story is based on mistakes and apologizes. also there are no bad guy until the tsuranis come into scene. there are many many better books..get some salvatore or weiss&hickman!!! they are far greater than this!"
5,Amazing fantasy classic.,"This book is one of the best fantasy books available in the market. Written in simple layman language makes it easy to identify with the characters, the story is very moving and throughout the whole book, you can't stop but amaze yourself about the wonders this fantasy-epic adventure has to offer. It was also the first fantasy book I read when I was a youngster. I still remember how it broadened my mind's eye scope of the world, the world of fantasy, of course!"
4,Great Beginning to a promising Saga,"I really like the way this series begins and I am looking forward to all of the books in this series - I am a huge fan of Sagas, and the goods ones are the ones that follow you forever - I picked up the first book after looking for it for months, and I couldn't put it down - that is a great beginning to a great series in my opinion."
4,Magician: Apprentice,A great begining of a series. Keeps you involved and you care about the characters. I can't wait to find out what happens. I ordered the next two books when I was only half way done with this one.
4,"Had a few flaws, but altogether a well-rounded book...","I have to be quite honest with you -- the first half of the book CRAWLS. We are constantly reading about Pug's magic problems, problems with Roland, problems with Carline. We're waiting for this awesome thing to happen but it's not until the last 50 pages or so that it gets as good as we expected. I have read other books by Feist and I know he has learned from his ""teething"" days of writing and I'd bet a lot that the series gets better. One other thing that bothered me was we are spent so much time reading about these characters but in the end we really know almost nothing about them or their past. Still a recommended read but don't expect a Tolkien or Jordan here."
4,Quite a Surprise,"MAGICIAN had been sitting on my ""soon to be read"" shelf for nearly four years, having been put off time and time again because I had a feeling it would be a Belgariad clone. Surprisingly, it was far superior.I've seen dozens of fantasy epics featuring the ""orphan kid who grows up to save the kingdom,"" but this one grabbed me right away and kept me glued with its steady flow of action.The RIFTWAR SAGA, at first glance, seems to be your standard fantasy setting with elves, dwarves and the generic goblins and monsters... but Feist's interesting system of magic, and the idea of the ""rifts"" that allow the enemy to invade -bring new life to the formula making MAGICIAN very worth while.-As someone else said- this is indeed a great introduction to fantasy reading!"
2,Average,"I bought this book based on all the good reviews. At first it was promising (though you were waiting for the characters to grow up from their teens for the book to gain some substance, which it didn't really). I have to say that I am 38 so maybe this is a great book for teens. But in my opinion this is not Tolkien, The Wheel of Time (TWOT), Fire&Ice, Name of the Wind or any other great fantasy book (I am a big fan of those as you can see). This can help you pass the time if you can't find anything else to read. When I was a beggining of the book it seemed like it could be quite good and since I couldn't wait to order the last book of TWOT, I went ahead and ordered the next 2 books of the Riftwar Saga. And now that I've finished The Magician I don't feel like reading them at all."
2,Not a Top 100 book,"I bought this book because I noticed it on NPR's Top 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy books list (#66), and because a friend recommended it. Perhaps I have been spoiled by reading George R. R. Martin lately, but everything about Feist's book rang untrue: the plot devices, the character actions and dialog, the jarring names. There were a few too many similarities to Tolkien (dwarven mines, elven tree cities, a golden talking dragon). I wondered whether it was supposed to be young adult fiction, but even in that case the writing would have to be considered poor.To be fair, the NPR list cites ""The Riftwar Saga"" and not this specific book, so maybe the author's writing improves in later books of the series. Unfortunately this book was not compelling enough for me to continue with the rest of the saga."
4,"An above average novel, but lacking fresh ideas.","This book was fun to read despite its lack of originality. The book started at a good pace and kept my interest far better than I expected, but I found that many of the most interesting locations in the book bore blatant similarities to Tolkien. I generally don't like to compare most fantasy authors with Tolkien, but in this case, a number of critics had already suggested that Feist had almost matched Tolkien's level of excellence. This is ludicrous in my opinion, but Feist can't be blamed for it, and one of the things I particularly liked about Magician was that it seemed entirely non-egotistical, unlike David Eddings. Anyway, the book was a fun, easy read, with likeable characters and a decent plot. I think I would have enjoyed it even more if friends and critics hadn't given it such vehement rave reviews."
4,well done,"as good as it gets, except for gene wolf and g.r.r martin or g.g kay. his fairy tail is the best"
2,Main character not used for 200 pages.,"As the title states...Near the end of the book, Pug is not mentioned and that tends to make the book really drag. Book is mainly based around medival times, including most of the fighting. Would prefer a LOT more magical battles. While not that bad, not exactly what I had hoped for."
1,writer: apprentice,"After all the glowing reviews I expected more, but was thoroughly disappointed with the pedestrian writing style and mundane situations - I haven't been able to get past 100 pages or so and this is going to mold on the shelf on which I keep my amazonian disappointments."
3,To be honest...,"To be honest, this was one of the last Riftwar Saga books I read. As a matter of fact, it was. It didn't really add much to the series, and most of it was pointless for me. The only thing it revealed was *how* Tomas got the Armor of White and Gold. Perhaps it added nothing because I never read a series from the beginning. Oh well. It was still good."
5,Fantasy has been compared to plausible reality in this book.,"I haven't read any other author that has come this close to making me feel as if I was really in the story with the characters. It took me a few books of the saga to get used to the feeling I got when I would finally set the book down. I would feel as if I had just been in an alternate reality rather than reading a story. I was able to really believe the happenings within the storyline to the extent of getting emotional along with the characters. If this book could do that to me, then it must be wonderfully written.I have read many books in my youth and none have touched my heart and soul as this book and the saga it is a part of. I look forward to more of this fine land that Mr. Feist has created and will enjoy whatever toil and trouble he may brew up for us next."
3,Descent fantasy.,"""Magician: Apprentice"" is an interesting piece of fantasy, but Feist doesn't spend nearly enough time developing characters (with the exception of Pug and possibly Thomas). I found Carline with her love troubles belonged more to a daytime soap opera than to a serious fantasy [sic]. And I don't have much of a stomach for the goody-goody characters who fill this book. Having said all that, it is a good read. The story has a nice flow to it, and it is a perfect book to pack along if you are going on long trip, and need something to read while you are in the not-too-critical a mood."
4,A wonderful adventure,"I had been looking for a series of good fantasy fiction since I had lost some interest in the Wheel of Time books. After trying one or two other series, I came across Feist and the Riftwar. Finally a story I could sink my teeth into. Great characters, exciting adventures and a wonderful setting (not just one world but two). Now on to the rest of the series."
5,A Wonderful Book!!,"I just finished Magician: Apprentice and Magician: Master. I must say, they really were fantastic novels. The books were well written, filled with quite a few likable characters and, with one exception, very accessible. The exception was that, for unknown reasons, the first few pages of Magician: Apprentice were kind of tough to read. After that, however, it was clear that I had real ""page turners"" on my hands.Overall, these were some of the best books I've read in a long while."
5,One of the greatest books I have eve read.,"I bought this book on a friday aternoon, finished it on saturday morning 4.00am, re-read it on saturday evening. Every time I need to re-chargemy battries, I read this book."
5,"A new, rich, mysterious world just waiting to be explored!","A brand new world that ranks against any of the greatest classics in the Fantasy genre.Feist is a creative genious who draws you into the book -- it's hard to put it down once it is begun.Once into the book, Feist rewards the reader with all the important elements of a great fantasy book -- love, mystery, challenge, growth, hate, humor, death and of course, magic"
3,decent stuff! 3.5 stars,"This is a good solid read. I don't want to bother going into who barrowed ideas from whom. I'm sure some authors I've read have gotten ideas from Fiest and possibly vice versus. Tolkien clearly was an influence on this author.I saw one complaint about there not being a 2nd part to this book, which made me scratch my head since there is indeed a 2nd, and 3rd part.If you like an easier classic fantasy read than this is for you!"
2,not so good,"feist builds his characters nicely. a lot from the character's everyday life. the enemies come suddenly. the plot lacks something, something that would make it really interesting. we are not told enough about them, and there is not enough suspence here. nor are the moments of suspence well enough written. i don't know, but feist has never really convinced me. he makes everything seem like stereotypes. it's probably the way he describes people's reactions."
5,Remarkable Book,"Magician (Especially Feist's preferred addition) is a masterpiece of fantasy. The characters, plots and rich descriptions of Midkemia draw the reader in from page one, and never lets you go until the end, no matter how many times you read it. With this book and with the ones that followed, Feist places himself in the elite group of fantasy/sci-fi writer's whose works are nothing short of masterpieces. Buy it and read it, you won't be disappointed."
3,Feist gets going.,"Magician; Apprentice is a favorable choice if you wish to read a fast paced fantasy novel. The book includes a love story, a war saga, and a LOTR style journey that takes its characters across Midkemia (many aspects of the novel are very similar to Lord of the Rings, such as Elvandar and Rivendell). Although this book is not the best fantasy you will read, it is the first of a seven book set, and will keep your attention if you desire to finish the books. It sets up characters early in the novel, and the rest is action-packed fantasy. It includes all the necessary elements of fantasy such as magick and mythical beasts. All in all, M;A is a very worthy read."
2,The saturday morning cartoon of Lord of the Rings,"This book is alright as youth fiction; it's not entirely dissimilar to a Heinlein youth novel. The kids in the book drink beer, so it's got that against it, but other than that, it's spot-on for teen fantasy.But the reviews don't paint it as such.From the *incredibly* cliche dialogue to the entire scene and setting, it's sort of like Feist quit making cartoons for Hanna-Barbera in the mid-80's, and then went on to write this book.Meanwhile, it's enormously derivative of Tolkien. It's entirely Tolkien's world that the characters inhabit. The only twist is the parallel world, but they don't see much of that in this book at all.3-stars, if you like predictable pulp fantasy with dialogue cliche enough to be youth fiction. 2-stars, otherwise."
5,Fiest = 2nd to Tolkien,"I get mad at people who say that this book is bad and dull. If they actually are trying to compare ANY BOOK to Tolkien then they will be saying its bad. No one can write like Tolkien obviously but Fiest can conjure up a world just as good as middle-earth. I read Terry Goodkind's Wizards First Rule and it was very character driven and I did not really get lost in the scenery because it was basically not explained well. But Fiest created a world of fantasy that shines. His characters are well developed and his story is excellent. Would you think that wierd creatures and magic were the crux of the book (it is) but have you ever thought of ""Alien"" invaders from another world invading this fantasy world. I think its as original as can be and if ever made into a movie would be just as good as Lord of the Rings. Your classic unsuspecting hero is brought forth again but with a twist. BRILLIANT BOOK!!!!"
4,No filler,"This may not be for the technically minded. It is however for the reader who longs for a sense of magic once felt while young. The magic lost in real life. This book made me want to look for more interesting biology and science books. It is a great leap ahead of his book ""the lives of a cell"". Many people will equate this with Tolkien. There are many hints at great back story lines and quite a few events that will become legend in this universe. The scene with the dying dragon will stick with me throughout the series and after.The best part for me was the exclusion of ultra realistic descriptions of every horse, castle, cart, tree etc. as some of the other fantasy writers tend to do. All in all this is great read full of promise."
4,No More Whining on how it Compares with Tolkien!!!!!,"I think I have just about heard enough about how it is just another one of Tolkien's ideas; how Midkemia resembles Middle-Earth and so on. Tolkien practically INVENTED the Fantasy genre. For this reason we could say EVERY Fantasy novel ever written after Tolkien is garbage and that no one will ever be able to compare to Tolkien yata yata yata...Well stop the comparison..so what if Midkemia resembles Middle-Earth? It would have to..just as almost every other novel bears SOME resemblance to Tolkien..He set the Standard...It is the STYLE the author uses and different techniques of writing that counts just as much as the story itself. And if you like Tolkien why couldn't you like any other who resembles him? Feist has a talent, he is a good storyteller, and all of you out there who don't like him because he is a 'so-called' Tolkien rip off GROW UP! If you liked Tolkien, and Feist resembles Tolkien, then you should like Feist as well..."
4,Great start.. gets much better.,"Okay, you have to read this one since it's the background story of everyone, but I think the second (Master) and third (Silverthorn) - i have not yet read the fourth - get better and better. Definately a different sort of fantasy novel (I have read some crap and it's rather difficult to find the good stuff) - it's original, whole, yet a pretty easy read so youth should also enjoy it (it does not have highly graphic adult scenes), but it's also not over-the-top d&d (I didn't realize a lot of the books I bought were until my friends saw them and giggled). So I recommend these books highly - they are not Tolkien, but who is?"
4,The magician is a master from start to finish...,"I was recommended Feist's book a couple of years ago, but at the time I was quite ready for them. I finally started to read the ""Riftwar Saga"" a couple of weeks ago, and I was immediately caught hook, line, and sinker. It's not that the book didn't deserve 5 stars, without the follow-up ""Magician: Master"" I doubt it could stand alone. I enjoyed it more than i enjoyed seeing ""Lord of The Rings"" at the movies. I look forward to re-entering Feist's realm, when I polish off the series with ""A Darkness at Sethanon"" and ""Silverthorn"". Well done Feist...! May your novels gace us with such pleasures as those who have come before you on the Big Screen..."
5,The Beginning of one Greatest Sagas you will ever read!,"This book was the one that set my imagination on fire when I first read it. I have read all of Raymond Feist`s works and still find myself thinking back to this book where the whole universe of Midkemia and all its heroes and villains sprang forth from. Anyone that has read any of Feist`s work and liked it should read this book as well as the others to see just how far this incredible story line has come. Feist is by far my favorite fantasy author and I am sure that if you take the time to read his work , He will become yours as well."
4,I love this book.,"This book is simply fabulous, it introduces the characters of a fantasy epic which will be remembered as one of the best."
4,Solid stuff,"Raymond Feist knows how to tell a story.Don't expect deep and meaningful literature, expect to be entertained by a great story.These are books from my childhood that I've re-read since and liked just as much the second time through.As I said with David Edding's ""Belgariad"", the books have everything that most fanasy readers want, the move along nicely, you like the characters and the struggles are titanic and you get to see the many different levels of the conflict, from one person's small problems, to armies in the field, to the cosmic struggle between gods.The ""Rift War"" is Feist's best and in my opinion, he hasn't yet matched it with his subsequent novels except perhaps his ""Daughter of the Empire"" series with Janny Wurts."
5,Feist When He Was Great,"Someone asked me today what I thought the all-time dumbest name for a fantasy hero was, and I almost immediately said ""Pug."" Admit it, it's a stupid name. Who can identify with a hero named Pug? Who wants to?Despite that, I have to admit that I read this book in 1982 when it came out, and still remember almost all of it. I'm shocked by the fact that that was almost 30 years ago, but this book and the rest of the Riftwar trilogy (i.e., the first three) were undeniably great. They weren't just good, they were great. If you haven't read Magician, then do yourself a favor and pick up a copy and read it over the weekend. If you are a fan of fantasy, missing out on early Feist is like missing out on Ursula K. LeGuin or Madeleine L'Engle -- not only bad form, but almost like an English major skipping over Shakespeare (or at least Ben Jonson)."
3,Not as good as I remember,"I read this book, and Magician: Master for the first time 5 or so years ago. I remember it being interesting and fast paced. This time when I read it I was interested for the first 50-100 pages, but once Pug goes off on his trip to Krondor, it gets boring. From there until about 100 pages from the end there is nothing but traveling from area to area with a few skirmishes to break up the monotony. I think this series has the potential to be interesting, as the last part of this book was good, but I was let down overall. I hope the second book in the series doesn't lag as much as this one did, or I will never get past book two."
2,"well, it was ok","I liked this a lot the first time I read it. Unfortunately it doesn't hold up as well on successive readings. Sadly, anything in the genre inevitably gets compared to Lord of the Rings. LOTR this ain't; while the concept of a ""believable"" fantasy novel may seem ludicrous, there are situations in Magician that just left me scratching my head, saying, ""well, that's a bit far fetched..."" Maybe I'm over the whole fantasy-epic thing, but next time I'll just pull out my other well worn novels and read them again....."
2,"A boring, stupid story.","It's hard to believe that the writer of ""Faerie Tale,"" an excellent, hard-to-put-down book, could write this drivel. Most of this story is filler and fluff. The very thought of reading the later books in this series is tasteful. To compare this to the excellent ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Belgariad"" would be insane."
2,Close But No Cookie,"I'll sum it up as quickly as I can. After reading about 2/3 of this book, I wasn't sure I wanted to finish, and I don't plan on getting the next book in the series.Pros: a couple of interesting ideas; Pug is a likeable character and the best developedCons: lots of re-tread ideas, especially from Tolkien; reads like a beach novel (lots of starch, not much protein); some completely unbelievable character exchanges (teenage boys don't act like that); some pretty saccharine dialogue and descriptions."
1,Sssshhyeaahhh Right !! And I'm the King of Siam,"The best book EVER !!!! Nope. Not even close. Not even in the top 100 if we were to compile one. Tired, dull, plodding, these are all words that spring to mind when thinking about this book. Ain't there anybody out there with any original ideas anymore ?"
1,give me a break,"Folks, this CD is a complete disaster. Trust me, I'm trying to save you some $$$$ (not like the others - below - did for me; These people are in complete denial). But, hey, I was a big Spin Docs fan (I own all of their previous releases, not just ""Kryptonite""), so my disappointment is not because I was looking for another ""Two Princes"", but this CD is actually worse than the last one (which, by the way, was the ""official"" beginning of the end). I guess the guitarist made this band, and w/o him, they just don't gel. As a closing thought, I still believe that these guys are way more talented than this junk."
4,Do I Honestly Smell A Comeback?,"Folks, believe it or not, I think this album is going to be the start of the comeback for the Spin Doctors. The originality on this one is great. If you have had any doubts as to what else the Doctors could do, after you listen to this, you will KNOW what else they can do...listen to this album...you WON""T be disappointed.:)"
4,Spin Doctors are back to a funky form like their first album,"If you like a group that can go from a latin beat, as in ""Vampire's in the Sun"" to a Beck sounding tune like ""The Man"" then this album is definitely for you! There are shades of their first album (""Pocket Full of Kryptonite""), but you can tell they have grown up as a group. This is an album that could propell the Doctors back to the top of the charts!"
5,"If you never liked the Spin Doctors, you've gotta here this.","This album diverges from anything they have done before. Not only are they back, they are moving forward. They still have a great grass-roots sound, but this time they have put their finger on the pulse of ""what is hip"". I simply mean, their influences are broadening, their minds are expanding, and their music is growing in the ways it needs to for any band to stay ""fresh""."
4,"Fresh, original CD with songs that will grow on you","I first picked this up not knowing what to expect - my last SD CD was ""Pocketful"". Anyway, at first listen I was disappointed. Yet I kept it in my CD and now I really love it. It doesn't have the same pop sound as ""Pocketful"" yet its still a really good CD with some catchy tunes ""Here comes the bride"", ""vampires in the sun"", ""wow"", ""siren dress"", ""tomorrow can pay the rent"" could all be hits in my book. The rest are still great songs too."
5,Hi-end acoustic blues,"Acoustic guitar on Eric's hands sounds very authentically. Bass strings go out on fronts, and nylons on surrounds. Voices are all around. I got a live performance impression. Stuff selection is multicolloured with strong jazz-blues layout. Blues fans should be listen, and buy this SACD."
5,"""He began to fly again. On campus.""","Proving that only a true idealist can be a successful cynic, Joseph Bayly's novella and his short stories remain some of the best-written Christian fiction available. Bayly writes amusedly of the religious world and its quirks, free from the sledgehammer moralizing of most of his successors. Part Woody Allen, part Ray Bradbury, Bayly manages to laugh at a great deal that isn't terribly funny until he gets his hooks into it; the title story is a fantastic treatise on evangelizing in bulk, and most Christians will probably spot themselves somewhere in the cast of caricatures. This is a must read for those who are looking for something a little more meaty than the Left Behind books and a little more modern than the Narnia Chronicles."
5,Dragoon Kicks Best!!!!!!!!!!!!,"dragoon gt is more powerful than even zeus.the only problem it has is once it enters into dranzer's den.dragoon gt might win or loose.dragoon gt has the most powerful attack out of all the beyblades.it can knock down 3 blades put together.but with dranzer it might make a tie or even lose.anyway my bro has dragoon gt and it broke dragoon f,dranzer v2,wolborg 4.it literally shattered them ."

1,Worthless and outdated.,"This book was written in 1993. While reviewing it, I noticed just how wrong the details are. Compare the details in this book to some of the brand name products. MANY are lower in fat, or calories, etc.Foods change over the years. Believe me when I say, you want the most current and comprehensive reference when it comes to a food almanac.Do not bother with this. It is now a paper weight, nothing more. There are better choices. Go to a local book store, peruse the many selections and select a CURRENT and comprehensive guide. Do not go for the CARB hype books. You need to know all the basics at the very least...protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sodium, and a guide that breaks down the types of fat would be the best...as long as it is current!!!"
1,The Complete Nutrition Counter,"I found this book useless, it's not complete. The only vitamins it shows are A and C, what happened to all the other vitamins that are in food. Also calcium and iron are not the only minerals we need, a nutrition counter it is not! Don't waste your money."
1,terrible,This is a terrible and frustrating can opener. Somehow about half the time I inexplicably cannot get the can to engage properly. Maybe it has something to do with the can itself or maybe I have a bad unit. I don't see anything broken about it so I suspect just bad design.
5,STRAUSS DENOUNCED IN DETAIL,"Shadia Drury's book originally was a cool and brilliant analysis of the Strauss dogmas, restrained in its criticism. This new edition is preceded by an even more brilliant 57-page preface which emphatically exposes the radicalism Strauss transmitted to his students. They now surround President Bush. His catastrophic policies show that Strauss' near-fascist teachings have infected their advice to him. Absolutely a must read for everyone who wants to know the political doctrines behind our present disaster in Iraq. Sartre88"
2,"A quick, quirky read","This was a quick read and mildly interesting. I liked some of the random thoughts of the obviously mentally ill main character, like him wanting to count to 180,000 by 17s, things like that kept the book entertaining and gave it a bit more personality. Outside of that, the story itself was kind of ho hum with a plot twist that was very obvious from the beginning and when revealed, it was done so matter of factly that it was almost as if the author was saying ""of course you saw this coming, I meant for you to"" (which I actually kind of enjoyed). I also almost liked the way it ended until it went just that one step too far and became almost cartoonish. Grab it from the library for something quick and painless to read."
1,HORRIBLE,"HORRIBLE PACKAGING! The book was jammed in this small box! the pages are bent and curled, the cover is crumbled and creased! it was awful!"
2,life,I like my book because it's confusing; it messes with your mind. It messed with my mind because I didn't think his friend Andy died in the Tuttle place. I thought he was alive the whole time cause of how he talked to him and he wasn't really there. Is he like schizophrenic or something? I think that that was pretty mean to put him in an all boys school I didn't thing that it was where he belonged. But he's crazy and sick in the mind because he used to look into Melissa room at night. This book really didn't make much sense. All it was pretty much was a guy writing down really long lie. I would recommend this book to people with time to waste.
4,Absolute Stunner,"""You could say that my railroad, the Madham Line, is almost the most important thing in my life. Next to Andy morrow, my best friend..... I guess you can say that I'm not only disturbed, I'm obsessed."" The book Invisible, By Pete Hautman is truly a amazing book. This fictional book is placed at Douge's house and his school. Douge is the main character and he gets bullied every day at school and he has friend that is completly different thn him. He is a star football player and He is considered very popular. Douge's only escape from school is his basment and his railraod city made out of matches. Through out the book, Doug get more and more beat up and picked on for the thng he do. I think this book is funny, Disturbing and d at th same time. I think 12 or over kids should read it because it has thins in the book that is not sutible for young kids to read or do. Read this book. Now."

4,2 sizes less,"it's a very good product, once you get it on, you can breathe easily .it doenst hurt like the usual girdles, and you feel as though you are2 sizes less. only you have to be very patient put it on."
4,Wow!!,"I wish to start off by saying that this is my first slimmer product, so I really wasn't sure what I was expecting out of it. Overall, I am very pleased with this item! I was hesitant about using my bra size as the size I was going to wear, but it fits perfectly. The only thing I don't like is the crotch part of it, but I'll deal with it."
4,Not Bad!!,This Item not only look sexy on my wife it really did what is suppose to do!My Wife Love It....
4,Nice Product,"This body briefer is well made and is certainly a ""very firm"" fit. It is going to take some wearing to break it in so that it is comfortable to wear all day long. I probably could have ordered a size up to make certain it is more comfortable. Otherwise, I think it is going to be just fine and what I was looking for under dressy clothes."
2,Not What I Expected,This body suit was like wearing a bathing suit. The only good thing about it was it hides some of my lumps. But it did not make me look slimmer. It is not really tight and I bought the suit small.
1,not thrilled,"My husband and I bought this for our brother in law since we have a similar model from another maker. the tv reception stinks and every time we put in brand new batteries, a liquid leaks out of the bottom."
2,"Sadly, it hasn't aged well . . .","Batman has been a favorite of mine for many years, but I can only recommend this title to readers with a great deal of unsatisfied nostalgia for 70's-style comics.If your aesthetics have grown with you since the 1970s, you might be disappointed with BATMAN: STRANGE APPARITIONS. Amongst the host of other Batman graphic novels and collections out there, you will find fare more deserving of your time and attention."
5,"Totally awesome, an excellent experience","The movie was in great quality for an old film, a real touching movie. I was finally glad I could see it again."
2,Only for the uninformed,"This book was not what I expected. The only ""secrets"" to be found involved things like chairshots and bleeding, and that took up all of two paragraphs. The rest of the book is filled with information that would only be of interest to beginners (I.E ""Who is Steve Austin?"", ""How do you win a wrestling match?"", and ""What is a DQ?""). No pictures, and it's all in large, double-spaced printing. A rather thin, small book for the price tag. The author's efforts are respectable, but this book was not anything I would recommend to seasoned wresting fans, only for the uninformed or beginning wrestling fan."
5,Long time fan,"I've been a fan of Danny Wilde since picking up an album (remember those?) in the early 80's from the band ""Great Buildings"". Since that time, I have bought and enjoyed his music. Any Man's Hunger is one of my favorite cd's, one that I pull out from time to time. If you have a chance to pick up any of his other solo stuff, I would recommend them highly. I know of at least 2 other releases, although they are not listed on amazon.com."
5,The most played cd I own!!!!!!!,"Rarely does it happen that an album or cd changes your life, but this one came at a very transitional time in my life. After being turned onto Danny's 1st solo effort (The Boyfriend) by a high school classmate (thanks Jeff M. if your out there),and totally digging it. I couldn't wait for his next gem. He didn't disappoint. As much as I could relate to the songs on (The Boyfriend), the tracks on (Any Man's Hunger) spoke even more to my heart and soul. Danny is one of the best singer-song writers I have ever come across. David Geffen of Geffen records once said of Danny that he was the next Bruce Springsteen. I agree, but unfortunately the masses haven't figured it out. Lucky for us Danny has put down on c.d. and vinyl some of his legacy. Buy it and enjoy it as I do-you won't be disappointed."
5,Excellent. Highly recommended,"I was very thankful to come across this book. It is unlike another dharma book in that it is more of a personal artwork than a talk or lecture. Very personal. I didn't feel so alone in my own perceptions of the world and sensibilities after reading. And coming from Zen, I appreciate the accomplishment and acute clarity and accuracy of language present in those coming from the theravada branch.Very comprehensive and detailed teachings with great artistic sensibility."
5,Beautiful Orchestra Music!!!,I love this music DVD so much!!! I recommend it a lot to those that like to relax through music. It is so relaxing.
5,My Favorite CD of the Season,"I don't listen to Christmas music until after Thanksgiving, and this is what I look forward to listening to every day. Amy Grant and Art Garfunkel have very complimentary voices, and although it seems like a boy's choir wouldn't mix well with them, it works beautifully. The way they present the Story of Christmas is unique. I get tired of artists rehashing the same songs over and over, so this is a breath of fresh air!"
3,Cabin Kitchens & Baths,"If you subscribe to, or even buy some of the log cabin magazines from the news stand, this book is a repeat for the most part. Most of the pictures have already been published over and over again. If you haven't gotten any log or timber home magazines lately this is a good book. Although, I liked Inside Log Homes: The Art and Spirit of Home Decor much better."
2,Nothing really new,"This is an ok book. The bath section is particularly mediocre, the kitchen section is larger and better. For those of us who occasionally pick up a log cabin magazine, we have seen these photos before. I am puzzled over the price of this book as it is just not that good. Save your money, unless you find a used copy for under $5.00 and pick up a cabin magazine every now and then; you'll have the more updated cabin decor."
1,Just go to Home Depot.,"I can't tell you how disappointed I was in this book. I was looking for original ideas to remodel my cabin kitchen but as one other reviewer has said, just buy the log cabin magazines. There is nothing new or inspiring in this book that you won't see in the cabinet department at your local home improvement store. Biggest waste of money I've ever spent on a book."
5,Pre Velvet Revolver,"I think for any fans of Velvet Revolver should look at this album. With the back bone of the band being former Gunners Matt Sorum and Duff Mckagan providing the driving hardcore rhythm, it rocks from beginning to the end.Be amazed at how similar it sounds to Velvet Revolver!"
3,Johnny Reno 1966,"The Citizens of the sleepy town of Stone Junction want nothing more than to lynch the outlaw they have sitting in their jail . But they'll have to get through hardbitten U.S Marshal Johnny Reno (Dana Andrews 1909-1992) fist ! . In the story of courage , romance , and revenge . Dana Adrews Portray Reno , a man og ideals who finds himself standing alone against the powder keg og mob justice . Also Starring film legends Jane Russel (1921 - ) , Lon Chaney Jr. (1906-1973) . Johnny Reno packs enough pistol-packing action to keep you riveted through the final, Gun-blazzing showdown. High Quality Transfer ."
1,Only For Diehards,"Here's proof that some die-hard fans will watch (and rate highly) anything Western. I can't be sure of course, but I think I would've walked out on this one 50 years ago, half-way through the matinee, as an otherwise uncritical cap-pistol-packin' 10-year-old.That being said, I hung in about half-way, just to spot all the familiar faces of the third-rate actors in the second-rate movies I enjoyed as a kid.Luckily, I picked this up at the library and will return it before the due date. It's not worth a 30 cent late fee.PS. I tried a no-star rating for this dog, but Amazon doesn't allow it."
1,broken after 3 uses,"Unfortunately, I thought this was a nintendo nunchuk, my mistake.However, it did work for the first few times the kids used it, then it broke.The connection isn't right or something. I'm going to try to return it. If not, I willstick to Nintendo accessories in the future."
2,Lasted less than 3 months,"I bought this item in 11/07/2011. It only worked for a couple months. By mid 01/2012, it stopped working. We have two sets of remotes and Nunchuks, the other Nunchuk we got since 10/2011, still works great. I hope this is not a refurbished Nunchuk disgused as brand new! Very disappointed with this purchase! Especially when I never had any issues with Amazon purchases in the past!"
3,task force but beaten,I buy 2 nunchuk in its original box and one of the nunchuk I arrived with a bang but both are 100% operational manuals and all
1,It doesn't work,I purchased this extra Wii Nunchuk Controller but it doesn't workThe joystick stucks when you move it up and down
5,A necessary accessory,"Some Wii games just use the Remote but others (primarily fighting games and FPS) need you to connect the Nunchuk to the Remote. It's easy: just connect it to the bottom of the Remote and it snaps in place. To disconnect, squeeze the sides of the piece that's in the Remote and it will come out. Simple, right?You can expect this to last a long time as it reinforces Nintendo's reputation of making high quality products. If only this came with the Remote instead of having to pay $19.99 for it separately. Oh well...buy this with confidence and ignore the 1 star reviews from people who don't have common sense."
5,wii - amazing design,whenever I use the wii nunchuck I'm always amazed at the sensor and the design. It recognizes the smallest movements and it fits perfectly and comfortably in your hand. really great controller.
5,NUNCHUCK MUST HAVE!,The nunchuck allows you to play many of the Wii games that need a nunchuck. You should have one for each Wii remote you own. Mine works perfectly!
1,Not so great.,"As soon as I took it out of the case, the stick did not work properly: it did not come back to center after I moved it. I myself have to move it with my thumb to the center, instead of it spring back to center. I thought of returning it, but gave up because I have all those process of returning."
5,Young and Old love it,The games with the nunchuk controller add so much to the Wii playing. Our family loves the action games.
3,Wii Nunchuk controller,Good product and works fine but we don't use it hardly at all. All the games my family like to play do not require this control.
4,Wii Nunchuk,This item was a Nintendo product not a copy. Works perfectly. It's a little difficult to unplug when you have the protective cover on the controller. The flap that protects the bottom hole gets in the way of squeezing the two tabs on the side of the plug to release it from the controller. Even adults try to yank it out not knowing you have to press in on those little side tabs. No one has broken it yet. I make sure I tell everyone that you must pinch BOTH tabs to release the Nunchuk cord.
5,Got the cheapest one and it is great.,"I was kind of scared I would get an unofficial nunchuk but when I got it I compared it to my original one and it look identical down to every last aspect. Handles great, response is great. I am assuming it is a nintendo make nunchuk."
2,This nunchcuck is being returned,"This nunchuck was used lightly for 2 days and is being returned , during Donkey Kong the monkey moves well after the handle has been released. Very dissapointing"
4,Great addition to the WII system,The Wii Nunchuk is a great addition to the Wii system. It makes a lot of the games easier to play. My husband and I as well as our kids really like having them.
4,"Fun, but not always needed.",The Nintendo Wii Nunchuk Controller works great. It plugs into the Wii Remote and records the action of your second hand. It also provides additional buttons for games that need additional input and it doesn't require a separate battery. I was surprised to find that this additional controller is only needed for one of the seventeen games that we currently have - Boxing on the Wii Sport Game Disc. Bottom line - like on everything - do your homework to make sure that you are getting what you need and need what you get.
4,Wii Nunchuk controller...,"Good size, easy to hold, works as expected.Seems that not many games make use of the Nunchuk anymore.Other: Amazon must have this thing misclassified for the ratings system - got asked ""How much fun is this game?"" and ""How do you rate this game overall?"" - Hello... It's a controller not a game."
5,nunchuck,"The nunchuck works great with our pinball game. However, the directions for installing is were worthless. We had to call our daughter to find out how to install it on our wii."
3,"good packing, but problems with delivery","This was the first time brought a product in Amazon. I was surprised by the packing. the products were totally well protected.congratulations. but I do have a complain. I ordered the product on Dec 8 and the delivery date was (around) Dev 16, but that day ( the 16 ) I received a email telling me that the products won't arrived on 16 and the new date was going to be 23.why did you sent the delivery notication the day I was expecting the products? I think that you should know about this delay problem before the delivery date and you should notify before.Any way, I'm very happy with the product and the quality.thanks"
1,broke in 2 days,"Just defective, I guess. Still, it would have been a lot easier if I could have returned it to a store same day, as we needed it for a b-day party. Dont think I'll buy things like this on amazon anymore. Not worth the inconvenience."
1,seller rating,"Wii Nunchuk Controller - BlackI bought this item from gizmosoutlet and I highly recommend that you don't do the same mistake I did. The product which was supposed to be an original arrived as a generic product in 3rd party packaging. I bought two products and one was broken and the other worked for two days and broke too.I asked for my products be fully refunded or replaced but with no results. The vendor asked me to ship which would cause me even more costs than the money I spend on those worthless nunchucks.In other words, don't waste your money."
2,good products but what happened to Target?,"I bought this and a couple of other things including the WII 20 pack.I had to return a broken charger within the 30 day warranty period. I mailed it USPO, without tracking it, to the return location provided on the warranty request sheet. That was month ago. It has not disapppeared but there is no RSVP from Target. Simple request for a warranty repair.No response from Target. Unfortunately mail order at Target for WII warranties was not responsive. Perhaps a bad rap on the part of their Mail order department will get me an answer---PDQ. If not, I am unable to see why anyone would want to order from them. Target on line and mail order process."
4,NUNCHUCK?,Great AcessorieyJusgt as advertisedFast shipArrived as advertised..could not play some games without it10 out of 10 satisfaction
3,Wii Nunchuk Controller,"Even though I haven't used the Nunchuk Controller that much, when I did, it was fun. My son-in-law and I did the boxing on the Wii Sport and I won, so naturally I thought it was fun. I can't speak for him."
5,Wii Nunchuk-yeah!,"Well, this was a definte HIT with both the son-in-law AND the grandsons!!I guess you just can't have too many of these!! Haha! Wii is pretty fun to watch, and even PLAY, but they have so much more experience than me, I always lose!! Next up is that WiiFit, thing..."
5,'chuck!,"Wii is everything that it claims to be, and more! I have MS and really need to be motivated to excercise. These games are better whoopie, not, but they are pretty darn good."
2,Problematic,"I had problems with this a week or three after I started using it. Primarily in how it attached to the Wii Remote. (Nintendo was really a bonehead for not making the Wii<-->Nunchuk attachment more solid. Something that physically locked onto the bottom of the Wii Remote would have been nice, to keep the Nunchuk firmly in place.Sadly while playing Skyward Sword, the nunchuk's connection started to lose integrity. I ended up dropping this one for an official Wii Nunchuk.And to make it more stable, I now have a stretchy hair band, like women use to make a ponytail, wrapped twice around the base of my Wii Remote Plus, with the Nunchuk wire snugly in place against the side of the WR+. This allows the Nunchuk and WR+ to move, without the bottom connection to wiggle even a little bit.I have since had no problems at all."
1,It's like I bought it used,This item is like a well used Nintendo 64 controller (if you know the reference you know that's bad) . Iv only been using it for little over a week now and the joystick is loose. I went to get another one from Gamestop and it was 100% better. This product feels like it was made and sold from the 99 cent store. It also came in a plastic bag inside of a amazon box
1,Defective right out of the box,I have marked the product as defective and written to the seller and have yet to hear anything from them. The product seems to have been just a bad fluke hopefully - but it isn't recognized by a single one of my brand new wii remote pluses.
1,Nunchuk=No Work,"On September, I decided to play my old Wii again.I seemed to want a new Wii nunchuk to play Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 and some other games. I ordered the Wii nunchuk off Amazon (this is what i needed to play the dbz bt3 game) and waited for 2 weeks straight for it. When it came,it was in a gray packet and I was very excited. I hooked it in the Wiimote and started to play. It DID NOT sync in! In my game, it kept on saying, (There is no Nunchuk connected to the Wii remote 1.) I was flaring mad that it seemed I couldn't play. If your buying this, this might not be the best choice. Go look at different types of nunchuks here at amazon. At least one of them might work."
1,Complete JUNK! 0 Star Rating,"The nunchuck worked the first and second time but after that it quit working. The game would always stop and say that the nunchuck needed to be plugged back into the controller (it was plugged in correctly) or that the operations have stopped for whoever was using that nunchuck (didnt matter which controller it was plugged into, it NEVER worked). After a few times of this, it completely stopped working at all. I paid for a nunchuck to work 2 times. A total wase of money!!! Do NOT buy this product or you will be throwing money down the drain!"
1,This Remote Is Not Worth the Savings.,"I bought this remote specifically because it claimed to be made by Nintendo, since I have previously had poor luck with non-Nintendo remotes. It seems to fall short of the Nintendo quality that I have grown used to. The remote's joystick became lose and stopped functioning properly in less than two months of light use. From day one, the cord would not lock into the remote, so it would come out at inopportune moments of game play. I would recommend spending your money elsewhere."
1,Awful!,I bought this Wii Nunchuk and two days after receiving it it did not work at all. It just went completely dead - it didn't work at all! It was also hard to attach to the Wii remote and stuck horrible while trying to take it out. I would not recommend this product for anyone. I would buy it from somewhere else - it's definitely not worth the headache of returning it.
2,Sucks for big handed people + it's a ripoff,"My main complaint about the Nunchuk is that it is extremely hard to press in the triggers and use the joystick. Nintendo is notoriously bad for this and it is similarly impossible on all their other controllers. For games that make you hold down the z button constantly this makes the game totally unenjoyable. This may be because of the size of my hands, but because I know many people who have this problem it is still a concern. This is a non issue on the Wii mote because there is no stick and so I am much happier with that.My secondary complaint is on the fact that it is not included with the wii mote. Most games require it and I think it's a ripoff that their separate."
3,Poca Sensitividad,"Bueno, este accesorio del wii mote es bastante interesante y es una de las razones que hacen el Wii tan novedoso, pero el problema es que actualmente el mercado no tiene juegos que den una fidelidad ni siquiera aproximada a la realidad. En algunas ocasiones se necesita mucha fuerza para hacer usado en algunos juegos o no es tan sensible como el control principal. Puede que más adelante se logre alcanzar un uso adecuado del mismo. Sin embargo, tendremos que esperar por otro aditamento o por una mejora de este complemento."
5,a must have for new wii owners,Our family just got the Wii for Christmas this year as a gift from the family and this was a must have so more than one person could play our new games. Only thing that could make it any better is if the Wii came with two of them from the get go.
1,Knock-off controllers- DO NOT BUY,I bought two of these back in April of 2012; it's now January 2013 and both have failed. My kids rarely use the nunchuk and I am present while they are in use. I believe these failed several months ago because I noticed they had only been using our white nunchuk and only one of them playing at a time (the Lego adventure series games). The white nunchuk is genuine Nintendo and the difference is notable. The joystick has a lot of play in it where the genuine nunchuk has none. The joystick is unresponsive in both of the controllers I purchased from this seller- very disappointing. I DO NOT recommend this product.My kids don't abuse their Wii or accessories and the genuine nunchuk has had no issues so I believe this to be a result of a poor quality (read: FRAUDULENT) product.
1,False advertising. NOT new,"Wii Nunchuk controller - Black. Sold by PSXPRO. Was excited to receive this item today as part of a gift for someone special. When I opened the bag it was shipped in, I was immediately disappointed. It was not new, as advertised... Right away I saw that the bottom of the box was ripped open and it was a pretty beat up box that also had black marker on it. Ok, I thought maybe since it's kind of old, the box wouldn't look great (even if it was ripped opened), but when I took out the actual item, it had clearly been very hastily shoved back into its original packaging... the wire was not neatly wrapped and tied as it would be if it was truly new. The cardboard inside was also pretty beat-up and ripped in places, and the nunchuk was covered in dust and fingerprints. I'm so irritated! This is supposed to be part of a gift next week! Definitely returning this and will have to go to Gamestop or something instead to actually get what I paid for."
5,I think is OK,No complains from my son yet . So I think is an OK product. I purchased it for about two months now.
4,Wii Nunchuk Controller - Black,This new product is awsome! I play every day with my family and we have a lot of fun together.
2,"it is a 3rd party, not from nintendo. it broke in 2 days.","the nunchuk I got is used (like new), it looks nice.but it broke in 2 days. I was playing Zelda Skyward Sword.Wii keep telling me connect Nunchuk to wii remote (but it is connected)"
1,Numchucks don't work,"I ordered two numchuks for Christmas gifts. Neither one of them worked. I am going to return them and I won't order from this vendor (Zhong Huo) again as I'm concerned about the quality and authenticity of their products. Now that I'm reading some reviews, it seems that others have had the same experience."
2,Worked at first.,"This is a knock off that worked better than our original Wii controllers at first, but one day it decided to stop working. If you are ok with a months worth of use then buy it. If not, buy something else."
5,Gift for Grandson,"My Grandson really loves the Wii Nunchuk Controller, especially since this is what he uses to play his Wii Games...:)"
1,Not original!,"I hate when this happens:Purchased as a replacement for another one that was defective. This one from a different vendor. I trusted the product photos and Amazon. But got something without a brand name, no logo, nothing.I'm just waiting for this to get broken pretty soon."
1,doesn't work after a few times,This item doesn't work after playing for less then a week. The Nunchuk came with the original package works perfectly. Worst experience with Amazon ever.
4,A must for the Wii,There are plenty of games for the Wii that needs the Nunchuks. I highly recomed them.
4,great just dont like nintendo set up,like i said in my reveiw of the classic controller i feel they are great products but to get full use of wii you need to buy 85 dollars worth in controllers which i feel is a little much.but i feel that it is worth having but mayb try to find sales or used merch.
4,Can't have a remove without a nunchuck!,"Though some games use just the Wii Remote, most require the Nunchuck too. I find the trigger buttons on the Nunchuck to be a bit difficult to reach as I have a smallish hand but otherwise no complaints. It also has motion sensors in it so it can be used to move on the screen too like in Zelda (shake for a sword action or thrust for a shield action) or my personal fav, in Wii Boxing you use it in your left hand to throw punches."
4,Hum,I would rather have wireless everything but when its wireless it is more expensive and harder to take care of. Very important to play many of my games.
4,Wii are in control,It makes possible some of the games that one plays on the Wii. It is easy to install and use and allows one to have more fun than a normal controller.
4,Good to have,I purchased an extra Wii nunchuck so that I could have the option of playing with multiple people rather than just playing against the Wii. I have only used it once because the only game I have that uses nunchucks is the Wii Sports boxing. It's worth the money to buy one so you can have it just in case.
3,multiple players,"I bought my Wii for Christmas and was disappointed to find out that it only came with the control for 1 person. Waah! Well Amazon has the most competitive price, I do have to admit that I think it sucks that you have to buy this Nunchuk separately from the remote, it should come as a package."
4,"There is not much to say, you need it.",1: I wish the Nunchuck was a bit more sensitive with the motion control. Sometimes it feels like it doesn't respond at all.2: Hopefully soon mad catz or somebody will make some better after market replacement.3: Unfortunately this is our only option for now. You need it for most of the games that you will play on the Wii.
2,Trigger works Poorly,"I did not realize that this was not a Nintendo made Nunchuck. I hate aftermarket controllers and although this one is licenced by Nintendo and looks identical, the trigger button sticks a little bit and is very slow to reset making it impossible to to push the button in rapidly. I also have an official Nintendo Nunchuck and it works much better. Avoid after market controllers, they never seem to work right."
2,Game extras boringgggggggggg,The Wii tennis racket and other stuff was boring when we got it home. But my kids liked it. The camera looks ok but i have not downloaded nothing yet for my daughter. It was a gift for her and she has given up waiting for me to download her camera stuff onto pc.Service from Amazon is ok.
1,Product failed after 2 months of light use,"I had to replace one of my original nunchuks (after several years of use) while the other still goes strong. This replacement however lasted less than 2 months of light use. It fits in fine with a ""click"" but the connection is interrupted if not applying pressure to the connection. Now useless..."
1,It broke after two weeks,"I take care of my games and equipment because I just don't have the money to keep buying new things over and over again. So when I buy a remote I expect to use it for more than a few weeks. I bought two of these at the same time and one broke three weeks later and the second broke a week after that. they didn't even really brake, they just stopped working, they look completely new but they don't work."
5,nunchuk great buy,I bought a used one and its definitely original Nintendo and it was in flawless condition. Not a single scratch i recommend this product. Always check ratings before buy it's smart.
2,Is it Genuine? I'm not sure....,"The picture on Amazon shows a genuine wii nunchuk, but what I received was in a plastic bag. When I got the product out of the packaging, I could hear it rattling. Now, it seems to work fine for now, but for how long? I'm pretty disappointed that this isn't a genuine Nintendo product, when it is advertised to be just that."
4,Handy item,"Seems the Wii keeps you spending money. We needed another Nunchuk to play some of our games. Got the item quickly, works great."
1,Wii Nunchuk Controller,The nunchuk you sent me was defective. It only worked for one week. Unfortunately the return date was too closed to the shipment date. I'm dissapointed.
5,Works flawlessly,Attachment for wiimote; works for all the games we use them for. The connection is secure and stable; kids have tried tugging them apart before and they hold their ground a just keep on working.
2,Still work but...,"Well this is the second one i get from amazon, the last one just stop working... and the package that amazon shows in here is completely different that the one they send me... so let's see..."
4,Wireless with Wires - BOO!,"Let me start off by saying I love my Nintendo Wii. It is a great system. I am not trying to bash the Wii as a whole here - just this controller. The controller itself works great and feel great in the hands. The one and only problem I have with it is the wire. It really is sad that with all the bluetooth technology built into the Wii and its standard remote this couldn't be wireless as well. Hopefully they remedy the problem quick, because you will notice it becomes a pain playing with the wire from time to time. I give this item 2 stars for the simple fact it has wires. Other than that it would be an easy 5 star product."
4,Works fine-pricey when coupled with wiimote,Works fine-pricey when coupled with wiimote. Does enhance the game experience on several games though.
3,Nunchuk Should Be Wireless,Not all games require the Nunchuk and you can live on just having one. Take turns it is cheaper depending on the size of you family.If you want to play multi player mode some games require you to have more than one of every thing and others do not. Make sure you know what is required for multi player mode before you assume you need things that you do not.I like the concept of the Nunchuk but I find it rather restrictive due to its direct connection with the Wii remote controller.I am planning on buying a add on to make the Nunchuk wireless.I think it should have come that way from the start.I do not know if the wireless devise will have a strap and that is something you should consider. You can get worked up while playing your games and you do not want to have to buy a new TV or pay hospital bills where a strap was all that was required.I have to do some research and ensure my benefits exceeded the cost before I buy the wireless add on.:)...
3,Super Mario Galaxy Nintendo,My 6 yr old son loved playing this game. His reading level is not quite there so he has trouble reading the text on follow on actions.
1,Even Real?,My order was fulfilled by one of Amazon's third party sellers. The item came wrapped in bubble wrap with no original packaging. I was told no where along the line that this was sold as used. Then I can't even find any markings saying Nintendo made this.Be very wary buying this here.
5,Wii Nunchuck OEM Works great,Bought it to compliment a 2nd remote. Works just like the original one. Use it mostly for the bicycling game on Wii resort.
3,ok,well its good for the price but does the job oki lke the item. i recomended for replacement it does
5,If you get an extra controller,you might as well get an extra nunchuk. We don't have too many games but you'll need this for boxing and for Raving Rabbits (which we love).
5,Black Nunchuk,"What can I say. It's a Nunchuk and it's black. It also looks great with the Black Wii controller. Sweet combo that everyone will fight over, like black hands on a legoman. Sweet!"
2,Good texture but poor adhesive,The decal has a good texture but did not stick to the frame very well. I ended up taking it off and throwing it away
5,Better than Disneyland!,"Sinatra is a legend...we all know it, and agree...but SKAnatra is a way of life! (too thick?!)Mixing the R&B/Reggae style with Ol' Blue Eyes creates a sound that only these guys can pull off. The results are some pretty tight licks and a unique style that'll put Hoboken, New Jersey BACK on the map.Check it out for yourself...and try to see them live...EVEN BETTER!"
3,Good if you dont know much about music,"Don't expect to learn about small details of songs in this book. It's more focused on learning the overall ideas of song forms, trends, and traditions. Easy to follow layout with outline subjects in the margins."
5,Fun Myths,"This was my first book by Trina, and I absolutely loved it! She offers her own unique take on the often misrepresented or just plain forgot about ""bad"" girls of the ancient world."
1,My girls LOVE Powerpuff girls,"Okay, my girls are 7 and 3. they really love the Powerpuff Girls. Neither one of them really liked this game at all. The game really makes no sense. All you do is fly around and pick up things. And the controls make it too hard for my kids to do this so they just fly around and get bored in about 3 mintues. Plus it's boring to anyone who CAN work the controls(You have to use the R1 button I think to pick stuff up). Why not make it either easy enough for kids or interesting enough for adults or both? Anyway there really is nothing good about this game, and I love games. My 7 year old has more fun with Tony Hawk and Twisted Metal Black. This is just not fun at all for anyone. Kids will hate it and so will you. Don't waste you $15 or whatever you can find it for."
4,cheap trick live,this cd will be welcomed by all cheap trick fans.playing a wide selection from the first 3 cds this shows why cheap trick is a true survivor.
4,There should be a law requiring CT to play 365 nights a year,"You just don't know Cheap Trick, and have no right to comment on their music, until you see them perform live. This recording is as close as you can get without being there. Highlights for me include the amazing ""Gonna raise Hell"" and the underrated ""So Good to See You"". As they say, the good outweighs the bad by 110%! My disappointment is in the remaining song selection. Where is ""Voices""? Where is either ""Heaven Tonight"" or ""High Roller""? We could have done without ""I Want You to Want Me"". I suppose I should just be grateful ""Don't Be Cruel"" didn't find its way on the song list! As always, thank you for the music Robin, Rick, Tom and Bun E.. See you at your next show in Milwaukee."
4,THEY'RE ALL ALRIGHT!!!,"I would recommend this CD to all Trickfans if only for the slow and sweet acoustic version of ""Ooh Caroline"". The song selection is like a typical Trick show where you get plenty of the hits along with some older shoulda-been hits. If I have any problems with the CD, I wish that they included at least one song from their sorely-overlooked 1997 CD. The sound mix is not as bad as the other postings would have you believe. It sounds like Trick do onstage; loud and in your face! Thanks for the Hangover Helper, guys! Now if we could just get a brand new studio album......."
5,CT PROVES THEIR POWER IN LIVE PERFORMANCE!,"MFH is truly definative of the power and awesome stage presence Cheap Trick has. I would definitely give this CD five stars. If anything could top Budokan, it would be this! The acoustic version of ""Oh Caroline,"" is a superb display of Robin Zander's ever-changing awesome voice! You can hear and feel the power this band exudes -- it sounds nothing like the ""studio"" versions. CT has gotten ripped in the past by record execs wanting them to have a certain ""sound""--- this CD is Cheap Trick's sound, and it sounds FABULOUS! This album is a must have for any Cheap Trick fan or anyone who wants to rock with an AWESOME live album!"
5,A timely reminder of why pop music is still important to me.,"Last year's shows that this album was culled from were among the most satisfying by an established band in recent memory. While the material may be twenty-some years old, the chops are fresh and recorded with spectacular clarity. It's little wonder that today's pop maestros turned out in droves to pay homage. Awesome 'Trick.' Rejuvenated."
4,THE TRICK MAKES A GOOD FIX,"PLAIN AND SIMPLE THIS ALBUM FLAT OUT ROCKS. THE TRICK TAKES CLASSICS FROM THEIR CATALOG AND PLAYS THEM WITH A RAW INSPIRED BOMBAST AND DEDICATION. THE TRICK HASN'T LOST ONE DROP OF THEIR ENSEMBLE CHEMISTRY OR TECHNIQUE AS THEY DISPLAY TO THE WORLD HOW TO ROCK A HOUSE DOWN.THIS BAND JUST TEARS IT UP AS IF THEY WERE PERFORMING THESE SONGS FOR THE FIRST TIME.SONGS LIKE ""HOT LOVE"",""THE BALLAD OF T.V. VIOLENCE"" AND ""GONNA RAISE HELL"" ROAR AND SCREAM WITH A VICIOUS POWER AND ENERGY THAT IS TRULY MINDBLOWING. I'VE NEVER HEARD THE TRICK ROCK THIS HARD!MEANWHILE POWER POP GEMS LIKE ""SURRENDER"",""I WANT YOU TO WANT ME"",AND ""SO GLAD TO SEE YOU"" BUBBLE WITH A GRAND PASSION AND EXCITEMENT MAKING THESE CLASSICS ALL THE MORE STRIKING.MUSIC FOR HANGOVERS IS NOT ONLY A LESSON IN SCINTILATING PERFORMANCE BUT ALSO A LESSON IN MASTERFUL POWER POP COMPOSITION.TRULY A CURE FOR THE PORCELAIN GOD BLUES!"
3,Docked Two Stars for Song Selection,"This is Cheap Trick live, so it don'git much better. The problem with ""Music For Hangovers"" is in the song choices. Only four of the CD's 14 selections are from albums other than the first three. By the time this album was released, The Trick had a long established catolog of great material. If the concept of the tour was to play one of the first three albums in its entirely complete of a three night stay. I wish they'd have given us a three CD set instead.That said, the album plays like a long lost set from the Cheap Trick seventies glory days and THAT says a lot. Seeing that ""Silver"" was released barely two years later, ""Music For Hangovers"" can be bypassed by the causal CT fan."
2,I plan to give away this book.,"There is some good information in this book, and it is full of nice etchings...infortunately, I don't learn well via etchings. There are some photos in the front, and they are small.For me, not a good learning tool."
1,Deceptive advertising,"We bought this book because it stated 'new color edition'. We wanted color illustrations/photos. When we received the book, the only color was on the cover! Black and white pencil drawings only inside."
2,Wild Edible Plants of Western North America,"Very few pictures and if you can't select the right plant, how can you trust eating it!"
3,Hang On to Your Hats,"This fan is awesome.....if you are really really hot !!! The ""low"" setting feels like (and sounds like) an otherwise ""high"" setting. The remote is very nice to have. The ""breeze"" option is very annoying because it makes the fan sound like its gaining then losing lots of power. Overall, its a great value for the performance and for the way it looks, compact as stand fans go. But be forewarned, this fan packs a punch....even on low (enough to knock over a table lamp clear across the room when placed on high)"
5,Charly McClain Biggest Hits,I enjoyed this cd very much. Wonderful selection of her biggest hits. I would highly recomend this selection.
4,Charly Mcclain,"Wow, this was a long awaited disc. Loved it immensely. I had been looking for this CD for a very long time and by chance found it. Very happy with the purchase."
3,first half is great,"the first half of this book is great. dance facts are presented with humor and stories about individuals in the book are fun to read. once he gets into the russian imperial ballet though, the book tends to be not about dance anymore, but about music. the author looks at history from music's point of view and not from dance. that's sad, because the first part of the book was wonderful. i wish the author had been true to what he started out to do."
4,painless way to learn german,"When I walked into the bookstore to buy an audio tape, I was sold over by the Living Language In-flights. They're perfectly painless and great for a quick and easy overview of the most useful expressions and vocabulary. I used it almost everyday for a month or two while driving and when I went to Germany to visit a friend, I was actually able to make myself be understood! It's a really good way to get started on learning a new language."
4,Language Prep,"I've bought other languages in the ""In-Flight"" series before. This one is a bit dated. It does refer to currency prior to Euro. Other than that, the basics are there and you can still pick up some thing. Not enough German is learned for a lengthy conversation, but that wasn't what I was going for when I bought this."
3,Bare bones refresher,"This product includes a very brief guide with basic words and phrases in German, and includes a CD. And when I say brief, I mean brief. Although it costs about the same as other phrase book + CD series (such as Berlitz's), it does not come even close to them in the scope of content. Not that the Berlitz series are all-exhausting, but this is pretty brief. If it's intended for an in-flight learning, they probably mean a flight from Austria to Germany.... There are a total of 18 lessons, but each lesson is about 2 minutes worth of CD time. That includes both the English explanation of the word or phrase, which is then once pronounced in German. It's useful, but not worth the price as it hardly covers anything."
3,im not sure?,I like it but some parts I just felt like skiping. I have not read the other books but I hope to find that they are better. This book gets you nots in your stomic but sometimes the anser might let you down. I hope you injoy reading this book more than I did.
4,Wonderful,"It's really good, but it gets into dry parts. I still loved it. If you like dragon stories, you'll like it. It's really funny. It's very adventurous. I've only read the first one, but I'm planning to read the whole series."
4,Cold Kill is a fascinating book about a cold woman,"I thoroughly enjoyed this Jack Olsen book. It's the story of a selfish, manipulative, spiteful, spoiled woman named Cindy Campbell Ray whose parents are sick and tired of her parasitic behavior (and let her know it). She fabricates tales of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse to gain the sympathy of her ex-Marine boyfriend David West. She is then able to convince him to murder her parents, which he does (along with Cindy as a tag-a-long). The horrific part of the story is that her 2 young sons were sleeping on the floor at the foot of the bed where her parents were murdered. How bizarre is that? Well, not too bizarre when you consider the type of person Cindy is. Jack Olsen does a great job of telling the story of Cindy and David. The family dynamics are interesting. If you think this story is good, you will really enjoy the book by Clifford Irving, also about Cindy and David, called ""Daddy's Girl""."
5,Oceans Of Fire,"Great movie. it would be hard for someone to understand the humor in this movie if they did not work in the offshore oil industry as a diver. it may be cheesy, but it definitely has its great moments. for 6 dollars, its worth having in the collection."
1,"over edited, and badly too","This show is probably a thousand times better in person, than on video. I couldn't say if I agree that the dancing is good, because I never got to see enough of it at once to know. There are so many changes in camera angle, from feet to face to distance and back again and from all areas of the stage, that I got a headache. It's too bad; I bet if this had been done properly it'd be great viewing."
1,Oversell,Wasn't perticularly thrilled. Was expecting more classical tap dancing. I wish the product details had specified that it was more 'New age'. At least I would have known what to expect.
4,Smart Steps 3rd Grade,"This software looks promising. I will have to update this review once the software gets used more. My 8 yr old daughter is more interested in playing some other learning software we have at the moment, so this just received a quick glance-over.I just wanted to let those of you who are browsing for educational software know what is included on this disc. It says that it's for children ages 8-9. It covers Math, English and Science, with ""other"" 3rd grade essentials. It states that it is the 2007 edition and it's for Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista. I hope this helps!"
3,Assembly poor but toy good,"Hi, This toy is for my 9 yr old daughter even though the toy personality is clearly a highly extroverted male. The toy understands 17 word commands and 27 listed passwords. It takes 7 batteries instead of the four listed in the specifications, with no electrical plug in. The speaker is ""tinny"", but certainly adequate. I believe the taped packaging was factory original and not reboxed. The package design is a marketers, and manufacturers, nightmare as the complicated design has to be held together by tape or, more visually appealing to the consumer, glue. There was one free screw in the box, but it looks like an extra. The toy appears to work fine, but the packaging makes one wonder if the toy assembly is as questionable as the packaging."
1,"NEAT toy, but arrived in HORRIBLE condition!!","I ordered ""Brian the Brain"" for my 7 year old. It arrived within 2 days of ordering! Unfortunately, it arrived a total mess. The box was smashed up and had obviously been opened and retaped poorly. The first thing I noticed when I removed Brian from the Amazon box was a rattling noise. Two screws were simply rolling around inside of his clear plastic head! The screws that hold his head together are proprietary and impossible to open, so I have no choice but to ship him back. I did get to try his Demo function, which was OK. His voice is hard to understand due to an inadequate speaker. Ugh!!! It seems clear that this company is selling refurbished products as new. While they might list the ""refurb"" part somewhere on Amazon, I have been unable to find it. Is that even legal?? Anyway, it seems like a neat product, and I plan to order another one. However, BEWARE. I am the second costumer to have a problem with the condition of the product upon arrival."
4,Brian the Brain a big hit - but will it last?,This was the one big item my neice's daughter (age 8) wanted for Christmas. It was much cheaper here in the US than it was in England and as they came over for Christmas we ordered it.The toy really is quite a remarkable piece of AI. Kimberly loved it. The facts it recites are quite remarkable but a bit advanced for this age group and the adults around found it to be quite repetative. How long the fascination will last I don't know.Construction is all plastic. I suspect that a drop on a hard surface might result in shards of sharp plastic which concerns me a little.Battery life seemed pretty good and the speach is quite clear.I'd like to see more variation in it's responses but overall I'd say Brian was a big hit. Being able to hook it up to an MP3 or CD player for a color organ effect was a nice touch but I wish they had included the cord to go between the two (stereo miniplug to stereo miniplug).
1,Defective toy. Buyer beware,"My daughter really wanted this toy. I should have paid more attention to the reviews. The idea seemed great. My experience boils down to 2 problems: 1. The toy is defective and doesn't recognize or respond to any spoken commands or requests. 2. Brian's personality is obnoxious and bossy. Lets teach a child by insulting them seems to be Brian's main teaching method. ""I can't understand you. Do you have marbles in your mouth""?...""You don't seem to understand this, maybe you need a nap? (something like that). I don't even want a replacement. Brian's lame!"
3,Little Brain with a big attitude!,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas. It was very cute on the shelf at the store and she really wanted it. Amazon had the best price by far, but even at that I have to say it's overpriced for what it is. It was extremely frustrating for my daughter trying to set up the password. Brian didn't recognize the word so she has to type it every time. (which really makes more sense, so noone hears your password) After we had a chance to play with him, we decided he's pretty fun. The trivia is great, but no 7 year old could possible know the answers. The jokes are cool if you're a kid, but we've heard the same ones a few times so they get old. Overall, this is a cute toy with a big attitude - which is the best part. My daughter's favorite is when he told everone to clear the room because he was about to fart!"
1,"tried 3 different ones, with the same result, doesnt work","The voice recognition does not work, we first thought we had a bad unit, but after trying 3 of them witht he same result realized its just not made well"
1,had hope but it was a dud,This did not work out as well as I had hoped. The biggest problem was that it did not recognize my sons voice. We were never able to get it to function properly. It irratically responded to other noises and became a nusance. BIG WASTE OF MONEY.
2,Brain Wakes up in the Middle of the Night,"We had to take Brian's batteries out because several times he woke us up in the middle of the night when he started talking. The first time, we thought an intruder was in the house. I did like some of the games, but can hardly use him since he can't have batteries in at night.JH"
4,Good Purchase,"This is an interesting toy and pretty funny as well. Brian's voice isn't completely clear, but it is good enough to understand. Sometimes he doesn't understand the voice commands, but you can type them in. So far my daughter has enjoyed it and I think she will continue to play with it. I would consider this a good purchase."
4,My 7 year old loves it!,Santa's gift to my daughter this year - and she loves it. Writes down the jokes Brian tells her so she can relay them later - LOL! Saves info about friends name and birth dates to mention in conversation and to remind her that their birthday is coming - way cool. Room alarm was a hit to keep her siblings out! Lots of other cool stuff we haven't gotten to use yet. To new to tell how long it will last but by the way things are going this is a great toy and she will use all it has to offer.
3,Okay,"well let me start off by saying this head looks amazing in the picture. When I received my head it looked COMPLETELY different from the picture. The hair was shorter, the skin is white it looks like a drag queen. The hair though is very healthy feeling and looking, and its 100% human hair just to be more clear. You can curl it and straighten it and it looks awesome. The head itself is ugly looking but the hair is great! well I wouldn't buy from this person again but the head I got was pretty good :)"
1,Error reading at startup,"I made sure I did my research and read all the reviews on various cameras before deciding to go with this one.I was highly disappointed when I got my camera home and put in the batteries, turned it on and immediately the lens got stuck in the ""out"" position with an error reading that said: lens error, restart camera. I tried to restart it a zillion times, only for it to say the same thing. I went on line and found that this is a problem with some canon cameras and now, instead of being excited about having this particular camera, I am completely disappointed.I'm glad others have had such good luck with their cameras. Please research the error because, in some cases, it didn't happen until a year later."
1,Product not working properly,"I purchased a Canon Powershot A710 7.1MP Digital camera and it is not working properly. It keeps telling me to change the batteries. I have had the same exact camera before and bought this one because I dropped my other one and broke it, so I am familiar with the camera. It is definitely a defect. Every time I turn the camera on, it tells me to change the batteries. I have tried different kinds of batteries alsom, and that's not the problem. I would like a refund from the seller."
5,Powershot 7.1,"Great camera and easy to use. Computer support program works with MS Vista. I also bought a underwater housing, but haven't used that yet."
5,canon 710 is,"this is a great little camera. not quite as sleek as the elph, but it has a 6x zoom lens. i love it!"
4,Great Camera,"I have not taken a lot of photos yet, but those I have taken have been excellent. I particularly like the 6x telephoto."
4,Canon PowerShot A710,This is a nice size camera with a large view window. I am very happy with my purchase.
4,Terrific Camera,Only problem I had was some difficulty in initially opening the battery compartment. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.
5,Great camera,As the first of Canon's great A series this camera comes with image stabilization and 6 x zoom. Great camera!
4,Good camera,"I'm happy with this camera. The zoom worked great for my trip to Europe- allowing me to capture all those gargoyles. You do need to steady the camera when using the high zoom or the photo comes out blurry. The memory card they include is a complete throw-a-way- it held 3photos before it was filled. I purchased a 2 GB card separately and with 300+ photos at the highest resolution, I have not found it's outer limit. Also, definitely purchase the rechargable battery kit. Their longevity is exponential compared with regular AA batteries."
1,Camera,Cancelled order with JR Music when I was waiting and got no shipping info. Emailed them and advised it was back ordered. should have been told that when I placed the order
5,Great Point and Shoot,"I bought this primarily for my wife, but i have found myself using it every now and then. She always has this in her purse, so it is nice to always have a decent camera around. I like all the manual controls, and the feel of the camera. On top of having a 6x zoom, it also has a very wide angle too. Great for landscapes. The image stabilization really works well. I would highly recommend this camera."
4,More than I hoped for,"New to digital camers, the Canon A710 IS was researched for features and recommended by a few in the know including one professional photographer.I haven't discovered all of it's features yet, but to date, I find it easy to use, lightweight, and easily carried. The images and zoom produce outstanding photos.I'd probably give it 5 stars. But I'll wait to check out the rest.Great buy at a great price. I tucked my Kodak Brownie away. <g>"
4,Excellent Buy,Product is perfect.Picture quality is good and lots of features. 6x Zoom is amazing and easy download. I liked this product.Only issue you may find is battery life but that is fine as you can get cells anywhere.
5,Just Right!,"Recognizing that I'm not an ""advaned"" photographer, nevertheless I still want the capability to exercise options beyond the basic functions of a lesser camera. And the A710 fulfills this need...and very nicely. Its size is just right for me; not too large but not one of those tiny marvels. I especially like the fact that it requires only two batteries instead of the need for four batteries...not much but it makes life a little easier. We spend a considerable amount of time traveling all over Europe and with the newly developed enhanced batteries I suspect that we'll do fine (taking a charger along is NOT an option since we travel light). Also, with an enlarged memory chip we're set for 3-4 weeks with no storage problems. I'm still in the exploration stage of becoming familiar with the camera before our next trip and am having great fun seeing what it can do. So far: ***** and counting!"
4,Easy Does it,A great camera for ease and comfort. The design is great for holding as I have arthritis and can grasp the camera with more security than my older flatter and thinner cannon. The process of finding my way around the options is a bit ackward but very learnable and doable. Picture quality is very good. Enough options for making adjustments when one wants; to and automatic when that is what I want.
5,Great camera great price,"This camera works very well. The IS helps a lot. The resolution is plenty. The camera is fast when not using the flash, otherwise there is a 3 second delay between shots when using the flash. The batteries seem to last a long time. I was surprised by this. I've taken a couple hundred in the last month and I changed the batteries but I bet I could have kept them in there longer than I did. Just two batteries which helps the wait. Overall I'm very pleased."
5,Great Camera,Love this Camera!! Works great for every purpose and situation I've put it through. Highly recommend!! I've had my work purchase several based on my recommendation and they couldn't be happier!
1,"20 minutes of use = ""lens error, restart camera"" DOA","I was really excited to receive the camera after doing several months of research. Unfortunately, after only 20 minutes of use, the camera failed to turn back on. Instead, I got the message that is part of the title. After doing some research on this error message, it seems that Canon has a long-standing issue with this problem. I guess I will be sending it back to them for repair, but it certainly is not starting on the right foot."
4,Daughter loves it!,"I'm an Olympus loyalist, and purchased the 710 for my daughter at Christmas, but she wasn't pleased with it. Her friends have this A710 that she's used and became comfortable with it. So I exchanged the Olympus for this Canon and now she's in heaven. My personal take on it though....too bulky for fitting in a pocket; not very compact. The menu buttons on the camera weren't obvious ('course, that's what manuals are for). Didn't have a flip-around screen (nice feature for kids). The memory card only allows for about 7 pictures, so plan on spending some serious coin to upgrade your memory. It's a good camera, you won't have wasted your money on it - just not my first choice."
5,Excellent image quality and features,"I'm very impressed with this camera. It's smaller than it looks in photos but still large enough to handle easily. I also bought Canon's accessory soft case (that's listed for the A700) and it fits nicely. A previous reviewer mentioned the protruding function wheel -- I haven't noticed that to be a problem yet, especially since the wheel has a *very* firm, positive ""click"" motion that feels like a fine piece of machinery. It would take a serious rub to accidentally move it.Digital cameras with proprietary batteries are OUT. Rechargable AA is the way to go. The disposable AA's that came with the camera lasted all of 30 shots, but those aren't serious batteries. Anyone who reviews battery life based on a disposable battery that comes with the camera needs to wake up, invest in a set of rechargables (about $10 for 4) and a charger, and then evaluate the battery life.Pros: Great image quality, especially w/ISStrong flashAwesome feature setCons: None yet"
5,Awesome Photo Quality,"As a graphic designer, I am very impressed by the digital photos I have shot using this camera. The saturation of colors, sharpness of details, and the smooth look of pictures are just perfect. I definitely recommend this camera to others."
3,not satisfied much with this,"this being my first camera and a latest model, i expected a lot. but i was disappointed. it sucks battery a lot. when i take pictures with nightmode, it takes a lot of time to store the pictures into the card."
2,canon a710 is,Camera takes good photos but flash takes to long to recycle if your taking a lot of flash photo it is poor..due to recycle time..
2,Canon Powershot not worth the money,"If i could i would return this item for a full refund, i am not satisfied with this camera, especially for the price. This item does not take the highest quality of pictures, my $150 HP R707 took better pictures and was easier to use."
4,"Good camera, but the flash refresh takes to long","So far I enjoy everything about the camera except how long it takes to refresh if the flash is on. It takes between 3-5 seconds, depending on the strength of the batteries, before you can take another picture. If you want to be able to shoot quick shots, you'll have to do it without using the flash. It takes about 1 second between shots without flash."
3,Good but something broke 10 months later,Bought this last March 2007 and it's now December 2007. Great camera compared to my old Nikon mostly because of the IS feature. It's easy to handle and a no-brainer camera. Unfortunately one of the battery connectors inside broke recently and it's in Canon Service Center right now. Good customer service though since I wanted the battery connector replaced but it would take 2-3 weeks to order the part. They soldered the broken part temporarily and I can use it for now. They will call me when the part arrives so that I can return the unit again to have a more permanent solution.
4,Great Camera,I love this camera. I've mostly used it to take photos of my 3 cats and one dog. The software that came with it is easy to use. My only complaint is the red eye correction does not work well. I'm using rechargeable AA batteries with it and it's great to be able to use regular AA batteries in an emergency.
4,Great camera - But very poor Flash...,"It is a great amature camera, with great video modes and flexibility - you can get some pretty cool effects by playing with With settings.it would be a 5 if not for FLASH - it is HORRIBLE. If you are taking picture inside at low light and using flash - well you will only see an object right infront of camera.Aside from that - my outdoor pictures are AMAZING. Also - zoom with IS is great. Indoor pictures in DECENT light are very nice as will - just change few settings."
5,Great Product,This Camera take great picture's and has a good screen I would recommended it to any one. are simple and easy to use and has a simple display.
3,Very slow recyle time on flash,I returned this camera after a few days because the recyle time on the flash is very slow. It takes 6-9 seconds before you can take another picture with the flash. This is way slower than my old Canon A85. Otherwise I do like the camera.
5,Excellent camera so far,"Previous camera was a Fuji 2meg so this is a big step up, also my first Canon. I was a little concerned by other customer reviews of slow picture processing times so I bought the SanDisk Extreme III 1G card to help with picture write times. Delay between pics isn't too bad, less than 3 secs or less. Camera itself is slightly larger than I was hoping but overall not bad. Easy to handle, buttons easy to use, and even though it has more options than I know what to do with, the menus are easy to move through and easy to change. LCD is easy to ready/understand. Pic quality is excellent and 6x zoom is excellent. Batt life doesn't seem too bad, I always carry extras though. Materials, workmanship, and overall feel of the camera appears to be first rate--smoe metal, some plastic, but with a solid/durable feel in your hand."
2,Watch out for red-eye and flash-recycling time,"Purchased this product and tried it out at my daughter's choir performance. Was really disappointed with the the red-eyes and the flash recyling time. Tried various modes from automatic to the scene/indoor mode. Picture quality is okay. While the 6x zoom is attractive, the picture quality is not. I returned this camera for a combo of Canon A640 and Canon monopod."
5,Great camera at a ridiculous low price,"I was shopping for a long time for a camera. I drove everywhere for a camera under $250. I found some nice cameras out there but nothing compared to this camera that I just stumbled across on Amazon. This camera is full function, full manual, 6x zoom with image stabilization, color swap. Everything you would want and more. Only problem I see is low light portrait photos tend to have red eye. Something I alreadt knew when buying a Canon and its usually a click fix in some photo software. All in all the biggest bang out there at the time of purchase!"
4,Great Camera!!,"I recently purchased this camera. It arrived one day before I was due to fly out to Palm Springs. I took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures. This may or may not be because I am a novice photographer. Even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry, but all others came out better than I ever expected. I think once I play around with it, my night time pictures will improve, but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me. No regrets with this purchase though. Also, buy a larger memory stick. The one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and I had to run out and buy another."
4,Good General Use/Enthusiast Camera,"The A710IS is a really nice camera in that it really packs a ton of features into a relatively small body. It is not tiny but still small enough to fit into a winter coat pocket. It has all manual overides or can be set in the auto manner for full automatic usage for those not familiar with photography. The IS feature is very helpful, allowing about 1-3 more stops. A nice feature is the ""grid"" overlay on the viewing screen allowing for better composition and leveling of images.Image quality is good, not great.All in all, for a point and shoot that has some advanced features, I would rate this a good buy."
4,Cannon A710 IS,"Great camera, many features. Amazon and Cannon should tell you the supplied 16mb card will only hold 4 pictures in memory. Another recommendation is for cannon to either leave the card out altogether or tell you it won't hold squat. The 1gb card is only $20+ dollars and will hold 500-600 pictures easily."
1,Very blurry Optical viewfinder,"The Canon Powershot A710 IS that I received had a horribly blurry optical viewfinder. I wondered if it was just mine, so I visited some local stores. The A710 at the local stores also had blurry viewfinders, but not quite as bad as the one that I received. I searched the internet and found others who experienced the same problem.I've looked at Pentaxs, Sonys, Kodaks, and Fugifilms, and all their viewfinders are very sharp.It looks like Canon has a quality control problem with this camera.I returned mine for refund due to the defective viewfinder."
4,"Good camera, but dated","As of 2011, you shouldn't be looking at this camera any more. It was great for when I bought it many years ago. you can buy much nicer stuff now. The biggest thing I liked about this camera was the control over shutter speed and aperture settings that you could do (if you switch it from auto to manual mode)."
3,"Good Dog. Only lasted a year, but was good till then","Lasted for about a year. Just stopped working over Christmas. Stopped showing an image in the display and wouldn't record a picture. Displayed pictures already taken but not for a new picture--just black. A repairman said would cost over $110 just to open the camera to confirm the problem, let alone the cost of repair. Took great pictures. Expensive camera for only a years worth of use."
2,"Good bang for the buck, but keep extra batteries handy","I was originally going to get the A630 but then Canon introduced this camera that had better optical zoom plus the Image Stabilizer feature. I also like that it has a bigger LCD screen than my old A75. The buttons are placed a little differently, and it feels slightly flimsier but overal it's a good little point-and-shoot with a great deal of features that I'll probably never use.My only real complaint is that it uses only two AA batteries instead of the four that my A75 had. That means that the flash recycle time is much slower. It also means that the camera runs out of power much quicker. Keep extra batteries handy."
2,Disappointed,Wonderful camera with one big mistake: The viewfinder is separate and not through the objective/lens. Due to the resulting parallax it is not at all suited for close up or macro photos.I had to return it.
1,Super Camera / Great Price,"This is my third digital camera, and it's by far the best. Great set of features with aperture and shutter priority, full manual, 6X optical zoom, 7 MP, and image stabilization. There just isn't another camera out there with the same features. Feels good in the hand too. I'm particularly impressed with the speed of operation, especially when using a high-speed SD card, and with the image stabilization feature. I've been able to take good quality shots without a tripod at the 6X optical zoom setting and the shutter speed as slow as 1/30 of a second. That would be impossible without stabilization. All in all, I think it's a great camera for anyone who doesn't need a SLR."
3,batteries eater,"all the nice features the camera has, is lost when it comes to batteries consumption. I bought the camera after I read a lot of nice reviews about it, and only 1 review mention the batteries problem which I did not pay enough attention, until I bought the camera from Amazon, tried for couple pictures, saw the batteries red light flashing, packed the camera back in its original boxe and ship it back to Amazon.if you're willing to keep carrying batteries everytime you use this camera, then get it, otherwise look for another one."
2,Defective,"I had to return this camera because it only worked for two days, then would not turn on. But Amazon sent me a new one within 3 days, and I received it the day before I went on vacation!"
3,I Wanted to Like it...,"I really, really wanted to like this camera. In many ways, it's wonderful - a great, long zoom lens, manual controls, and a nice form factor. My main issue is with the LCD display - it's very difficult to see when you're outdoors. Indoors, it's plenty bright. (There is an optical viewfinder for use as a back-up outside, but it's nothing to write home about). I compared the display on this camera to the one on Canon's SD700 by holding both cameras side-by-side outdoors, and decided to go with the SD700 instead. I would have preferred to stick with the A710, but couldn't cope with the LCD."
1,Depends on what you want,"I've been a big fan of Tammy Wynette for most of my life. I could sing you (poorly) nearly every hit she ever had, phrase by phrase. I paid nearly $40 for this (used not new) DVD and I am truly disappointed. This was a total ""formula"" concert; no feeling, no passion, no heart. The songs are churned out in rapid succession as if this was a highlights reel, some just brief snipets of the actual song. She looks gorgeous and this DVD will appeal to many. I mean, it IS Tammy Wynette. But this is not the Tammy I wanted to see or was willing to shell out so much money for. Instead, you can spend a 4th as much money and get the real Tammy Wynette, graceful, honest, true, singing great individual performances in the 60's and 70's on ""Tammy Wynette Legendary Performances"" (also available here on Amazon)."
3,Tammy Wynette,"I was very excited at the thought of owning this DVD and seeing Tammy in concert for the very first time. I live in Barbados, in the Caribbean, but I cut my teeth while growing up, on Tammy Wynette & George Jones, Loretta Lynn & Conway Twitty and Charlie Pride among others. However, I was somewhat disappointed at her seemingly lacklustre performance. Her voice is still sensational but she lacked dynamism on stage. Still, it's a good buy for those who just want to hear the First Lady of Country & Western sing."
3,This CD is missing original tracks!,"If You can find The original vinyl or cassette, You will get the entire recording, as this CD is missing some tracks that I've never heard elsewhere. Although this is a very good album on CD, I was VERY disappointed to see that there are songs missing. hgr 12/05/99"
4,Molly Hatchet Rocks!!,"This album kicks booty! Molly Hatchet was the first big rock act I ever saw, opening for Riot and AC/DC (on the Highway to Hell tour! Little did I know Bon Scott would soon pass away!). Songs like Flirtin with Disaster and Beating the Odds sound great, but their version of Freebird really gets me going! Even my THIRTEEN year old daughter likes it! I cannot believe the great job they did on this song and I would definitely recommend this album to any rock fan! Funny thing is, I never knew they ever released this album until I saw it on Amazon.com!"
3,5 star perf. with 2 stars taken off for POOR sound quality,"This is an excellent performance by an excellent band. However, whoever mixed this cd should be shot!! The quality is very muddy. You can hardly hear the keyboards. You can't hear them at all at times. There are also some painfully obvious rhythm guitar overdubs. There is little or no stereo separation on the 2 guitar players. I can't listen to this cd. It just sounds too bad. And it's a real shame, because the band sounded great that night. Somebody did them real wrong. Try to find it used."
3,good coke and whiskey.....,"Cocaine and whiskey, just a couple nails that have tried to close the coffin on this monster rock act from the South. Here they sound like they are out of coke and hung over!! Even still they rock better than virtually anything out there today (which probably explains most of these very generous reviews), but if you really want a serious dose of the band, go w/ the King Biscuit Flower Hour record. I don't say it b/c I like lead singer Jimmy Farrar better (although I respect that opinion) just that the band plays w/ 10 times the fire on that record than they do here. The double live out of germany from about '03 smokes double trouble live as well. Here you also suffer w/ a very mushy mix w/ Bruce Crump's snare drum getting the typical '80's pussification. Worth having but don't stop here."
3,disappointed,"I have this tape and I was so happy to get on cd finally but then 1 of the 2 songs that I really bought it for was dropped off the cd. Look carefully, I didn't.It seems to me with the other 2 live cds available, with many duplicate titles, and the similarity of Fall of the Peacemakers live (awesome song) versus the studio version, etc. they could have left Walk With You on the Live cd. Other than that, I do love this cd, but I really wanted Walk with you."
3,3 1/2 stars. Decent Live CD of a great band,"Molly Hatchet recieved MUCHO grief for releasing Freebird on this album.Riff West(bassist) was a guest speaker/consultant at a recording arts institute I attended and said this album was basically blackballed by the industry and fans alike;sales were dismal at best.This release was an embarassing moment for the good 'ol boys. Aside from that controversial point, the album is a real southern rocker. Anything with singer Danny Joe Brown is good stuff! An excellent addition to your Hatchet collection."
4,Deliciosa,"De las fragancias de Salvatore Ferragamo mi preferida es Incanto Shine, me encanta, es una mezcla floral y frutal muy intensa. Me gustaría que durase un poco más. Llego en perfectas condiciones. muy recomendable."
2,Broken when I received it...,"I absolutely LOVE this fragrance, however, when I received my shipment, the bottle was intact, but when you spray it, it leaks bad!"
4,Refreshingly Charming & Girly,"Beautiful, youthful fragrance. You really do smell the notes of pineapple and other fruits. It is sweet. So for those, who are looking for a more mature fragrance, this might not be the scent for you. But I love it because it is light, airy, and I am young at heart. It's probably not sophisticated enough for a mysterious, sexy date night out; but it's perfect for casual daytime and it will just bring a smile to your face.For me, a little spray went a long way. This EDT lingered on me all day. I've had other eau de toilettes, which faded much faster.The design of the bottle is divine. Again youthful, not sophisticated. And yes, the bottle cap on top of the spray nozzle is plastic and you do have to push it down firmly in order for it to cap tightly. But this is only a slight inconvenience to me, when compared with the outstanding price.I'm really pleased with this smell and it's on my top perfumes list."
1,rubbing alcohol?,the bottle i received leaks everywhere when you try to spray it and the only scent i'm smelling is rubbing alcohol.
3,Good price,Item was delivered timely. The price was reasonable. Fragrance smelled very different than what I sampled in the Ferragamo retail store.
5,lovely scent,This is a lovely soft scent. One of my favorites. I usually buy at Nordstrom's but it's way cheaper here!
4,very cheap yet overwhelmingly elegant,"I was hesitating to buy this because I its online. But I ended up buying it anyways. The shipping is really fast. When I received it, I was expecting a girly scent. But when I smelled it, it smelled like a guys scent. its disappointing. But when I smelled it twice, it changes my judgement to the perfume. Its actually calming, yet awakening. For me, its not a girly flowery scent, its like a lady flowery scent, you know what I mean. (girly flowery is very sweet this is more formal) also, I tried spraying it on every corner of my room before I sleep, and guess what! I cant sleep at alL! I dont know why. but all in all this is a great perfume, but in a while you'll get used to it, so its good to have more than one perfume =)"
3,A Beautiful Tale,"An old woman tricks a blind man. The blind man feels he is useless to his family. His friend, Loon, knows his sadness and comes to help.""O Loon I am old and blind. My family are starving and I can't feed them. I do not ask to be young, but I would not be so helpless if I could see. I would give my most precious possession to see again."""
1,Phone falls out all the time,"This case seems like it was designed in a little too big of a hurry, on the very first day the phone fell out of the case unprotected onto the ground several times, I kept trying to make adjustments to the latch to make it stay closed but basically this thing puts my phone in more danger than if it had no case at all.Aside from that the belt clip fell to little pieces in the middle of the grocery store with litle springs and pieces of plastic skittering everywhere.To top it all off the assembly work is sub-par, mine arrived with dried adhesive from the assembly process smeared all over the clear window making it look permanently smudged.Basically a useless waste of money, especially when you consider that shipping cost me almost as much as the case itself."
3,Audiovox xv6700 Apache Case,"For this product, it is sturdy and strong. I have dropped it a couple of times and my phone is intact. It also keeps the phone clean.However, it would be better if this had a secure latch. Couple of times, my phone fell out of the case (luckily, it is a strong phone or after 5 drops, it would be back in the junk yard!) It case makes the phone look bigger. Couple of times, my friends gasp on how big the phone is but I tell them that it's just the case that makes the phone big."
4,nice case,"The slimmest fitting case i could find. All the cut-outs are perfect to access all buttons, ports and even the camera lens on the back. The belt clip is flimsy and not secure. I dont wear it on my belt anyway so i took off the clip and use the case just for protection. Looks a bit bulky but it has a nice design. Ive dropped it several times and its fine and ive never had a problem with the phone falling out of the case. If you are not using your BT, it also protects the screen from your oily face as they are hard to clean on the inside edge of the touch screen."
3,I have the book & I lived in Sicily in the 60's,"Written in 1956, this book is no longer an accurate portrayal of the economic life of sicily, yet I found it to be an accurate and entertaining, (although a bit acerbic) portrayal of several other aspects of sicilian culture. Having lived in Sicily in the 1960's, I can say I enjoyed it very much. You may contact me if you want further info at the email address given above: markjeblan@aol.com"
1,Terence Stamp Underused,"Terence Stamp has so little dialogue in this movie that his talent has been very underused. Here is one of the most talented actors of our time not being allowed to act. There are long close-ups and a rather thin plot. Accordingly to his autobiography he had just been dumped by Jean Shrimpton and this was a very painful time in his life, as he had to go right into production on this film. We don't see him at his best, or even close to his capabilities as an actor because of his emotional state, and also the script of this movie. It is still worth purchasing if you are a Terence Stamp fan as he is just worth looking at anyway.Sara B."
2,put the bags in they fall out the other side...,"not very sturdy and doesn't hold the bags well. put them in one side they go right out the other. its unbalanced. Once you put purses in it, its very wide and heavy...good concept but didn't follow through."
3,It functions as advertised.,"It is OK. Not my ultimate solution for closet space, but freed up a shelf above clothing rod, so more space is good"
4,I like it,"This holder is useful, it fits nicely in my wardrobe and holds alot of my bags. I am happy with it"
2,purse holder,"Just as advertised, the pocket sizes are nice for small to medium purses. Just a hook and does not hang over a door which is a problem, it would be better having the hooks that shoe holders have that go over the door. Not sure how to overcome this issue for hanging, I did not want to hang this in the closet. Disappointed so I will look for a different style."
4,This is a great idea! But need more sizes,"Would have gave it a 5 but because little things that need to be done I gave it a 4 because I do like it. I ordered 3 of the purse organizers and could not wait to organize my closet with this item. First of all whomever came up with this idea has a good thing going, but I wish there were different sizes like small, medium, large. I got all of my purses in the slots and because the other side is open the larger purses fit which is ok. But if someone re-makes these please have different sizes and make sure the other side is closed. But this is a great product for now."
2,Doesn't do the Job,"The slots in this organizer are much too small to be a one-product solution to purse storage. I could only fit in clutches and foldable nylon bags, but all of my leather purses had to be contorted and stuffed to fit. Also, some of the handles on my purses won't fold over, so there is no way those could sit in the slots either. A big disappointment overall."
4,Nice Option for Storage,Just what I needed. Downsized from a large house to a small cottage. Need storage options. This was very helpful. Only con is that the plastic sleeves could be a little thicker.
4,Working great for the few bags I have,"I don't have enough purses and other things to fill all the slots, but it is working well for what I have. Nice to get them off the floor."
4,Great,"I purchased 2 of these, one for myself and one for my daughter, I have no complaints, it is lightweight and when you place your bags in it, don't stuff you bags before putting them in, it is plastic and can rip, it is not the best best quality but it does do its job. My daughter's bags are small so she sticks about 4 bags in each."
4,A book that'll make u keep on reading it!,This book was pretty chilly. right til the end it holds u up to keep reading it. it has just so much of suspence in it that u just can't leave it for a moment. This was actually one of the most exciting hour of my life.
5,Blew me away,This book was SO SO SO SO good from beginning to end! Total page turner and full of surprises. The ending is sooooo unforgettable.
3,Best R.L. Stine book I have read!!!,I have always like horror/thrillers but mostly Christopher Pike. This was the first R.L.Stine book I actually got into. It was great.
2,Ridiculous ending and some bad acting blow it.,"Starts off good and goes downhill. When you see it, I hope you agree that Robards would NOT have gone in the water to his ship as this person he just trecked through a hurricane to destroy walks off with his daughter! Don't worry, I didn't give anything away...there's nothing to give away.Special effects are great and so is Dayton Ka'ne's body, but that's about it! And I totally don't believe these two are in love.I've heard the original (directed by JOHN FORD) is great. See it instead. That's next on my list!"
5,Hurricane,An interracial love story of 2 young people from 2 different worlds who's relationship is interrupted by family and nature. This story has beautiful scenery and peeks into to difficulty of overcoming racial discrimination.
3,Hurricane,"Charlotte (Mia Farrow) travels to a Samoan island to visit her father, the governor (Jason Robards). Before long she falls in love with the beautiful native chief Matangi (gorgeous Dayton Ka'ne). Their romance is not popular. The story moves slowly and there's not much more I can tell without giving away plot points that occur more than halfway into the movie. And this is the movie's main problem. The adventure part of the movie doesn't start after well over an hour. Director Jan Troell has never been known to make fast paced movies, and this time the script is working against him. It takes a very long time before the story really takes off and by then many viewers will already have lost their interest. The location shots are beautiful and the hurricane scenes are spectacular. These help it up to a very weak three star rating.The DVD is presented in 1:78 widescreen (from 2:20 original). The 2 hour movie is divided into only 10 chapters. There are no special features except a trailer."
3,Love among the Ruins,"A remake of 30's classic - this was panned on release and was considered a flop on release in 1979, but it arrived when the genre was already in the death throes with big flops like Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and Meteor.As a reminder of those big 70's disaster movies this is a standout...with unbelievable special effects for the time.However the first half of the film concerns itself with the romance between Mia Farrow and handsome island boy Dayton Ka'ne...which is beautifully photographed and believable some of the criticism at the time was that it was just too long and dull before the real special effects start. However in the tradition of any great romance there is the angry father, the tribal dances, a trial a scorned navy captain etc etc.A must have for fans of the 'disaster genre' like me with wonderful special effects and one of the most beautiful movie scores I have ever heard."
3,"Dicussion of the product, movie quality","At last the movie was issued on The widescreen DVD format. But what you see? The colours of the ""Hurricane"" are very contrast and blue-oriented instead of the cinema version that I have seen before. I was really wandered why is it so? And still didnt received the answeres on this questions! the quality are not original and the colours are very poor. Any way the film is great but this DVD version is not good! I hope that there will be another remastered version of this movie by Paramount in the future, of course in widescreen."
3,Ok but I liked the 30's version better.,"This was the 70's remake of the classic 30's version of this south seas tale of love, cruelty, and how one bad hurricane tops all the human drama.I wanted to see this remake as I had never seen it before. The story line has been changed and not for the better Im afraid. I thought being in color would make it more interesting, but without the over the top acting in the first one-this remake is just bland. Its funny- but the hurricane effects in this remake are not as good as in the old 30's version."
1,Wait for SEASON 8...,"These episodes are priceless but the creators' marketing strategy is practically see-through. Die-hard South Park fans are better off resisting this quick cash cow DVD than falling for this cheap trick. Save your hard-earned $$$ for the boxed sets of Seasons 5, 6, 7 & 8, which will include all episodes featured on ""The Passion of the Jew"" (respectively) plus all the other episodes from these seasons as well!!! ""Gee Kyle, that's a swell idea!"""
5,South Park,I was particularly interested in South Park because my daughter (Mary Kay Bergman) was a voice actor and it was a chance to see and hear her work. I found it interesting and it gave me a glimpse of what she had to offer the world. Nothing is sacred in South Park and it brings out many of our good side as well as our bad side of life.I am in the process of collecting everything that she has done as a personal memorial. The producers of South Park take humor to new heights. They give us much to ponder about ourselves.
3,"Great episodes, but not enough.","As others have said, these are 3 great episodes. That's also a problem, because it's only 3 episodes. I can wait until the seasons these episodes are on come out."
2,Warning: Censored,"Passion of the jew is a great episode of South Park. I bought the DVD so I wouldn't have to watch a poorly dubbed version recorded of television on my pc. However, upon viewing the main episode of the DVD I found it was that a sound effect was censored from the original TV airing of the episode and that is the sound of the whip during the scenes of the boys watching the movie in the movie theater. To me if you buy something on DVD is should be just the way it originally aired or uncensored, not censored. The episoded this DVD contains are great. But this censorship of a sound effect in a product I paid for is inexcusable. This is just a warning to those looking to buy the DVD."
1,Passion of the Jew,"I felt really ripped off when I found that it was just a regular episode, not a ""special"" like I thought it was. I already have this episode (it's part of the eighth season) and I also have the two ""bonus episodes"" as well... It'll make a good gift for someone I suppose.Don't get me wrong, it's as funny as you'd expect, brilliant even, but if you are already a collector of South Park box sets, beware - you don't need to add this to your collection!"
4,"3 episodes, no frills","This dvd contains three South Park episodes and a few trailers, nothing else. The episodes are: Passion of the Jew, in which Cartman starts a neo-Nazi group, Kyle feels guilty for killing Christ, and we find out that Mel Gibson is a bit ... eccentric; Christian Rock Hard, in which Cartman starts a Christian band; and Red Hot Catholic Love, about the priest sex scandal. As usual, the dialogue is profane, insightful and hysterical -- and NOT appropriate for the kids!"
2,"""We want our money back!""","In an attempt to exploit from the release of the real ""Passion"" on DVD, Comedy Central attempts to rake in a few bucks by releasing this lackluster collection of three episodes of the show. While the three episodes are superb, it's really not worth you shelling over your money. You're better off waiting for these episodes to be on the season sets (""Red Hot Catholic Love"": Season 6, ""Christian Rock Hard!"": Season 7, ""The Passion Of The Jew"": Season 8). And besides, for only a little more than double the price, you can get one of the season sets that are out already, and have five times the number of episodes. Think about THAT."
1,ARRIVED DAMAGED BY PREVIOUS OWNER!,"THE PRODUCT, LABEL AS ""LIKE NEW"" CAME DAMAGED BOTH THE DISC AND BOX, SO MUCH THAT THE DISC COULD NOT BE READ BY MY DVD PLAYER OR EVEN COMPUTER."
2,good episodes but...,"there are only three on this dvd. There all funny but I'd wait until the complete season of 6,7,8 came out instead of just buying this. However I would rent or burn this."
1,South Park - The Passion of the Jew,Never got the dvd but see it on south park. It a great show if you like south parkMike
4,"2 Very funny episodes, one overrated episode","The Passion of the Jew DVD is a very good DVD for the most part. 2 of the 3 episodes are excellent, but I beg to differ on The Passion of the Jew.It was overrated and disturbing. I have a friend who is VERY Jewish and I felt really bad after watching it. However, the other two episodes are awesome. Cartman crapping out his mouth and starting a Christian Rock Band is better than watching Mel Gibson smear s*it over a door and yelling in klingon."
5,Awesome CD!!!!!!! NOW is the time to get it!,"I just got this cd yesterday, and I loved every song, I really don't have a favorite. They're all great. Jessica has a beautiful voice, and she really uses it on this album. Also, fyi: it says that there is 15 tracks, but there's really 16, #16 is the ballad version of ""There's more to me than you."" Which is also very enjoyable. Get this cd!!!!"
2,SHE SOUNDS JUST LIKE FAITH OR MARTINA.....,"Some of the songs here are good, most notably ""Never Be Forgotten"".....beautiful. I heard this song on the radio and I thought it was Faith Hill or Martina McBride singing. Herein lies the problem. The song is good, the voice is good. But if she sounds like Faith or Martina, there's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there. Add to this that this is mostly bubble-gum pop and not country....there's really nothing that stands out here. Why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there? That's the question."
1,NOT country music,"This album just like all of Jessica's albums is not country. This is Nashville at it again, trying to sell pop as country. Whan will you learn Nashville that country fans like myself are sick of pop music passing itself off as country. If you like the typical nashville pop singers like, LeeAnn Rime, Shania Twain or Faith Hill. Then you are sure to love this junk. But if you are a country fan I would advise you not to buy this. But one thing I am glad about, is that her career didn't last longer than two years. Jessica you are now a has been. ~~ Twang"
5,Wow she is great,"I heard WHO I AM back in 2000 on the radio, but didn't care about it enough to find out who it was. Honestly I thought it was a 'one hit wonder.' Now in 2007 I hear the same song again really impressed with the voice, so I want to find out who did it. Now that I know it is Jessica Andrews I am hearing all her other songs, but I'm wondering why I never heard more from her. Her voice is great, (not just really good, but great) but I guess I wasn't impressed with the one particular song at the time. But why didn't I hear these other songs??? I don't think she got any exposure!?"
4,A Great Album,"This is Jessica Andrew's third album and it's great! Although it's different from her first two attempts (Heat Shaped World & Who I Am) her voice is still wonderful. Moving away from the catchier up-beat pop country from before, this CD is more mature in content. Most of the songs have a good melody and uplifting lyrics. It's great that she can grow as an artist but stay true to her original sound. Although it's not exactly easy listening (most of the songs being slow love songs) you'll still find yourself singing along."
5,Was This Album Written For Me?,"Oh my goodness, this is an awesome album! I first got intrested in buying it after I heard the song ""There's More To Me Than You"" which Jessica Andrews herself co-wrote! I was driving home after a bad day and it came on the radio and I had never been touched by a song so much. I recently broke up with my boyfriend who thought he was my boss so I can sooo relate to that song. Then the other songs, including ""I wish For You"" and ""God Don't Forget Us"" are very good! Way to go Jessica!!"
2,"his dad, Machiavelli","Not bad, but my biggest gripes were: 1) the self-centered, machiavellian father who conspires to ruin the love lives of his children for reasons that seem sadly out of place in the modern era; and 2) since Rowan and Phillip were separated for years --- with the Rowan hiding Phillip's child from him --- I expected some big revelation as to why they were torn apart. Somehow hearing that Phillip's father had told her a lie and prevented them from speaking just didn't measure up to my expectations."
2,Did Not Like This -,"I did not like this documentary - far, far too heavy on efforts to hype the dialogue and emotions, not enough on actually touring the country and seeing eg. Pleiku, DaNang, Hue, Nha Trang, and Saigon before and after. I was, however, taken aback at the very beginning - seeing a modern Boeing 737 utilized by a Vietnamese airline."
1,lasted 5 minutes,"My kids took them out of the packages (I bought 2) and the ball had broken off within 5 minutes, and then they proceeded to hit each other with the paddles so I had to dispose of them.Waste of money."
1,What a waste of my money,"This paddle ball is the pits! The paddle is as thin as it can posssibly be, the string is too short to do any tricks at all. There were tricks we use to do as kids that I wanted to teach my kids, not w/ that paddle ball!Overall it was very dissappointing to think someone claimed to be selling a nostalgic toy, and it was nothing like the original paddle ball at all.Very disappointed mom in Manassas Va."
1,Terrible quality unusable,"Lasted five minutes and then elastic snapped. I should have noted the manufacturer's recommended age which was 114. It proved too much for my six year old. I'll try again in 108 years. In all seriousness, this is a piece of junk."
1,paddle ball,Very cheap...saw later at dollar store. Would not recommend this to anyone. One of the rubber strings broke immediately. Not the quality i had as a child.
1,The ball ripped off literally on the first paddle,Would not recommend for anything other than a prop. It fell apart immediately when I tried to use it. I'd value more around $.59.
1,bat and ball,"i remember being small and this bat and ball was much more durable, the bat was thin and it broke after a couple of paddles. It was much more sturdy, back then. i would not purchase one again."
3,What happened?,"This disc looks like Rhino made the first disc all nice and good. Then, after it sold well quickly churned out this ont the market. The video quality is no where near as good as the original. the cover art is virtually the same. It has video error lines and colour faults in the picture, the entire picture looks soft. The intro still has the totally stiffled music, the credits are still the Still frame credits and not the animated ones that the original series had. Also away from the shoddy making of the DVD the writing is quite bad compaired to the original disc. You can see that they had no-where to go for ideas, no wonder it only lasted 13 episodes(including the 5 on the original disc). I recommend the first disc to everyone but this disc only to completests as it has less episodes, of a lower standard of production in worse quality for the same price.I will probably still be buying the third disc if they make one simply as a completest, and in the hope they can turn it around."
3,Turn up the Volume!,Looks like they will release the entire series on DVD here soon. Who knows if we will be as lucky with Transformers. Anyhow this DVD set ROCKS!! THE VIDEO quality is AMAZING!!!But Whats up with the sound.. you have to jack it up to 25 or higher to just hear the background music in the OPENER. the audio on the rest is good but I MISS THAT OPPENER. Why didnt they just use the audio from the VIDEO if they couldnt find something better. Come On Guys. Take that little extra time... Other wise this DVD is GREAT!
4,MORE ! MORE ! MORE ! ;:-),"I received the DVD 3 days ago. GREAT disc. The image quality was so-so but that is to be expected of an old SUNBOW cartoon from the eighties. (Prints deteriorate). My only complaint: no toy commercials. 4 stars all in all. Please, people BUY it so Rhino will start releasing G.I. Joe, Jem and Visionaries on DVD as well. Hopefully as COMPLETE DVD BOX SETS !!!"
5,Love the Flaps !,"My 3 year old loves spongebob (i usually try to steer her away from him), she insisted on getting this book over all other valentine books. I was really surprised when I read it to her. The illustrations under the flaps are adorable - I was really impressed with the detailed valentine cards given by spongebob. I enjoyed reading this to her. This is definately one of the better spongebob books I've come across."
1,Feisty Woman ?,"ELAINE RATNER'S BOOK, ""THE FEISTY WOMAN'S BREAST CANCER BOOK"" IS STRICTLY ONE WOMAN'S OPINION. MS RATNER EXPALINS IN DETAIL HOW SHE CAME TO HER DECISION TO HAVE A RADICAL MASTECTOMY. SHE DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES. THIS BOOK IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A WOMAN WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER. I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO WOMEN WHO HAVE ALREADY MADE AN INFORMED DECISION TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY. THIS BOOK PROVIDES ONE WOMAN'S OPINION ONLY."
1,Disappointed,I was given a copy of this book after my lumpectomy. This book is very one-sided and I have read several inaccuracies. It is definitely not a book for someone newly diagnosed whether she is feisty or not.
1,The worst breast cancer book I have read,This book is written by someone who clearly has no medical background and is unable to read and interpret research clearly. There are an incredible number of inaccurate statements. Following this kind of advice could kill you. It's the kind of book that perpetuates myths and does not help the cause of women anywhere. Terrible book.
5,Great book,"In high school they used Word Smart as part of the curriculum for SAT prep. At the time we hated it, but now as an adult I'm glad that I saved the book in my parents' closet because I dug it out to use once again as a reference. The book is well-organized, well-written, and a fantastic resource. As a writer I have started studying this book once again, and will probably buy Volume II soon."
5,So fine,"What a great resource. Any one who wants to understand huck lace should have this book. It is an excellent gathering of all of the very best articles on huck lace from a decade of Handwoven magazine. Helpful for begining weaver's and very useful for advanced lover's of Lace. No better reference on huck lace, and I have looked at many of them."
5,Excellent guide to huck,"This is the only book out there on this weave structure, making it a vital addition to your library, especially if you do a lot of lace weaves. Written for the advanced weaver, it shows a wide variety of drafts for huck, and shows you how to make your own. Good stuff!"
5,I Like A Bit of A Cavort...,"I love this album, for its answer to anarchy that it overcomes. ""If you gonna rob a bank you must be aware - you gotta use the computer upstairs."" The samples from ""Good, Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Fistful of Dollars"" on Medicine Show perfectly punctuate the outlaw old west groove. E=mc2 still hold its own to this day, and is great if you're a Nicholas Roeg movie buff."
4,The only B.A.D. you will ever need ...,"That even goes for the so-called Greatest Hits CD; too bad but they really petered out. There's a good chance the music you listen to (especially if it's dance oriented) has been influenced by this record in some way. The first side is better than the second though it's all good. The first song, ""Medicine Show,"" may be the coolest with its Spaghetti-Western style undercurrent. Particularly funny is the judge reading a long list of crimes committed by ""Tuco Benidicto Pacifico, Juan Maria Ramirez (known as the Rat)"" but sentencing him to hang for using marked cards. Also great is the machine-gun overload and the ""I Am the Walrus"" style laughing.Too bad this band went downhill after this album."
1,An appropriate name,"I'm afraid I must disagree with the other reviews.Great punk rockers do not make good hiphop artists (see Marky Ramone and Tommy Stinson). Off-key vocals can be hidden with the screams, loud guitar, and throw away lyrics of punk rock. It is not so easy in the hiphop genre. Mick Jones first post-clash outing unfortunately reveals his vocal limitations. If the songwriting was outstanding, it wouldn't matter. Unfortunately the songs are mediocre at best. Quite a bit of effort went into the sampling and production, but it's only icing on a mud pie. Of all the tracks, only Bottom Line still sounds okay ten years later.My advice is this: If you want hiphop, by the real thing, not this poor attempt."
4,BAD's best,"Mick Jones and Don Letts had a good thing going when they penned this album. I would rate this as one of the best cross over albums ever made at the time, it's surprising how over looked it was in hindsight as most of the tracks on this album are out of sight. The track that defined BAD at this junction was 'Medicine Show' Ennio Morricone's 'Good the Bad and the Ugly' was a center peice for the song's structure, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach had some great lines as well but the clincher was the Bandit's response to Humphrey Bogart in 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'""I don't have to show you any stinkin badges!!"" Letts' made an art of sampling before it really caught on and this first album by BAD was a real gem."
3,the way it sounds and feels,"I find it has its ups and downs. the up ois that it gives a tramendace sound from a scale of 1 to 100 i would give it a 110 + its very snug. although it is snug it puts pressure on the top of my head and i always have to adjest it wich is a pain in the assbut slowly im getting used to it. The sound of it is sso perfect that it beats the sound quality of the bose sound canceling headphones wich uses battery that i have to change all the time and each battery cost lot of money there are so many features i like about it like the strech distance of the cord, te adapter plug abilaty to seperate. well lets just day these r the perfect dj head set i ever owned oh ive had these 4 about a 10 days"
4,Good Products,"Good, now it was that I received prodcto bought (Stanton DJ PRO 2000S DJ Headphones). I have proven it and it seems to me good quality.Greetings.Grellysvir Lunar"
4,Great value for the money,"I have owned a pair of these for about 18 months and I find them to be a great value. I bought them for their great sound, but I soon discovered that they offer about 20 dB of sound attenuation, so I use them on airplanes, and they are great. I haven't had any durability problems, and I have brought them to Europe twice and across the US several times with no problems.I think they are fairly light for their size. They do get a bit uncomfortable after several hours on a long flight, but i think any over the ear headphone would for me.I have only two complaints, both minor. First of all. the headphone plug is a bit large; I would have designed it differently. This may seem minor, but in an airplane seat it does get in the way, and I worry about bending it if I move. Secondly, I wish it came with a padded case for travel, though I have found they just fit into an old CD player case I already had. If it weren't for these two things, I would give this five stars."
4,Great phones of nice quality,I purchased these for my wife who has her own radio program at our local KCAW station.These are so comfortable and the instrumentals are so much sharper for her through these. She'd hoped they also had a volume control.
5,Everything is as announced,I choose this item by mouth to ear recommendation. Everything is at my taste. Very comfortable and affordable considering all the other headphones out there.
4,Great headphones,"I have used a number of well thought of headphones and these Stanton's are my favourite. Great value for the price, I use them for a number of music applications and also some gaming/general use. They are constructed well and have a great sound, slightly orientated to the Bass frequency's but certainly not lacking in Mids or Highs.They are tight feeling from new but after a few days loosen up, the cord is not ideal for my devices as they are frontside headphone outputs and the elbow design is awkward.These little complaints are quite overshadowed by the great sound of these headphones, Stanton's great for music and very good for everything else."
5,Great Product,"This is THE way to clean windows, no more streaks! The 14"" scrubber and 16"" squeegee save time, you can clean a standard household window to a spotless shine in under 30 seconds. It is worth the money, and would recommend this to anyone looking for clean windows."
2,Disappointing Rolie Polie Olie,"After waiting for the 1st of the Rolie Polie Olie cartoons to come to DVD, we were all so very disappointed. There was not enough of a story line for a full feature film and yet it lacked the simplistic appeal of the short cartoons we are all used to seeing. James Woods' character Gloomius looks flat (2D) and much too awkward & scary for the little ones. I expected more from William Joyce and the animation team. It's not a character you could grow to love by the end of the movie.All in all, they did a poor job stretching a 7 minute cartoon to a 75 minute feature film."
5,Excellent,This is the best banks I have seen. I have gottem My son almost all of them now and when it got here he was so happy with it. The product is an ok size but the detail is what makes it a seller. iT LOOKS GREAT IN HIS ROOM
5,Spider-Man!!,"Like the other superhero bust banks that have been released recently, this is a must have for comic nerds like myself. Spider-Man looks exactly the way you see him in the pic, and that is a really cool pose. He is a little smaller than the Superman bust, but he still looks great. Since it is a piggy bank, it is hollow plastic, but it is still very durable. Overall, really cool"
2,Unimpressed,"This item arrived with one arm broken off:/ Also, I understand there are molding irregularities, but this Spiderman bank had SO MANY black streaks where it is supposed to be red or blue. I guess I can't complain too much since it was so cheap to purchase and is for a child. We fixed the arm ourselves instead of dealing with sending it back. Should work fine."
4,Very good quality videos,"The quality of these videos are outstanding! But, that's all there is besides a photo shoot, a couple of websites and credits. The other dvd has much more extras then this does, but this dvd is also cheeper, if you buy it anywhere but here! So, recommended, but the other ones better!"
4,changed,"i have changed. most of my reviews i have dissed avril. sry. i just didnt like her cuz she swore so much! she has a good side 2. i give her cd's 4 stars cuz her songs r good, ecept 4 the cussing."
1,WORST OF THE WORST!!,"I'VE NEVER HEARD OR SEEN SUCH A HORRIBLE 'ARTIST' IN MY LIFE! WHY AND HOW PEOPLE ENJOY THIS GARBAGE IS BEYOND ME!! EVERYTHING INCLUDED ON THIS DVD IS ABSOLUTE FILTH AND SHOULD BE BANNED FROM THE COUNTRY AND SOLD ON THE BLACK MARKET IN MALAYSIA!! UGH, ABSOLUTELY AWFUL, MISERABLE, TERRIBLE!!!"
4,totally unique film,"This film is a one joke wonder... it is still very clever, and well worth having in a collection of novelty films"
2,"""Box Lunch""? hmmm, someone was reading early Florence King","Hollywood tomatoes cavorting with Rip Taylor and Professor Irwin Corey (taking time off from accepting awards for Thomas Pynchon) so you've got shtick up the wazoo. This film isn't so much a cinematic capturing of the swinging 60s as it is a record of the death of burlesque. It reminded me of The Buggles ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" and The Simpsons episode ""Bart After Dark"" (featuring a tribute to Sheckey Greene), where the consequences of Venus never becoming Hera because of Ortho are spelled out with Marilyn impersonators and double entendres flying. The only things missing was a bump and grind score, a light up bow tie, and a punchline rim shot from a bored drummer."
2,"A lot of information, but difficult to read.","This book was well researched and well written, but the author's opinions are strongly felt throughout the entire book. The author's voice is also somewhat condescending. While I did learn a little bit about Arab women in general and women in Oman in particular, a much broader sample of women's lives in Arab countries is found in ""Price of Honor"" by Jan Goodwin. Also the information in Ms. Goodwin's book was researched for several years in the 90's, whereas Ms. Wikan's book is based upon only 9 months of living in Oman during the 1970's."
3,Interesting reading but need to encompass all women of Oman,"This book focuses on the women of Sohar so it should be entitled Behind the Veil: Women of Sohar because I know personally of Omanis and not all women are dressed nor act in this manner. It is interesting reading but needed more pictures, especially in color."
2,A woman from Oman's Desert,I don't think that all Omani woman are far behind like what is shown in this picture. It is just a small category of people.
4,very readable,"Gives good look behind ... Oman seems society without conflict, or at least now one shows it...Is this reality or utopia?"
5,the card trading system is amazing,"This game is not so different from the FIFA 07. However, the fact that it brings a new game mode like the card trading one makes it very interesting. I also ejoy the gameplay a lot more. The ball and the players move a lil' bit slower now. It makes it look more real. Great job EA sports!"
4,Good Game - Awesome price!,"Not a gamer, but this is a good soccer title and has the basics down for someone like me to start before I get into more complex titles. The price is awesome for this title and it was perfect for my inexperience with this type of game."
1,cannot be installed on winXP 64b Pro system,"Intuit requires SP3 for installing TurboTax 2011, 2012. Since MS never had SP3 for winXP 64b Pro, because winXP 64b Pro doesn't have the problems as XP 32b. Intuit's software developers are very dumb, when they see XP, next step is to detect SP3. w/o SP3 in a winXP 64b system, they don't allow TurboTax to be installed. C'mon Intuit, you cannot be so rigid!"
2,National Parks,"There were a few photos and some historical info. I had hoped this book would describe the parks as they are today. For that, the book is totally lacking."
5,Beautiful book!,"I bought this book as a birthday gift for a friend. She had seen a copy in a localbookstore, and I decided it would be great for her, so I got on Amazon to order!Have not given it to her yet, her birthday is in December! I would like a copyfor me too!!"
1,A review about the reviews,"The Frontrunners IMBR seems to have a completely fake set of reviews and also the ""review helpful"" percentages and numbers. How on earth are you going to get 70 people to like a review for a board review? Every review has this many ""helpful"" votes. I have to believe these are fake. I would stay away from this product unless you can actually hold it in your hand and see it. It may be a great product, but I would not base my opinion on the reviews, as many people on Amazon tend to do.Look at all the 5 star reviews and see how they are spread out over many years. Each reviewer also has only one review, as somebody else had pointed out.It just proves that you have to review the ""reviewers"", and I use quotations as I believe they are likely fake. Do your homework, and do not be deceived by the supposed 5 stars for thsi product."
5,Oustanding. WishI'd known about it earlier.,"Great syllabus! I got my copy 1 week before the exam after my partner recommended it. I'm sure I got at least 30 points from the STARRED (*) items alone, which I scanned the day before. That's a must. The Q&A book was also truly excellent. Even better, my Q&A book was free when I called Frontrunners for my syllabus. Excellent resources if you're aiming to pass your I.M. boards. I only wish I'd known about it earlier."
4,An excellent introductory text,"I found this an excellent introductory text for any serious student who is keenly interested in, but unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with, the region. A liberal sprinkling of lucid maps and well-annotated photographs render the book eminently readable. The strictly chronological treatment of the subject matter helps in an easy understanding of the interrelationship of the various factors at work which shaped the unfolding history of this fascinating region."
5,"DAYROOM...watch these guys, theyre going to be HUGE","Ive heard both CD's and seen these guys live...awesome...Theyre hilarious in the strain of Barenaked Ladies, and are great musicians too...Good solid rock, fun rock, party rock...too good to pass up! Definitely worth the buy! Great sound, great vibe...can't say enough good about them! See them live if you can, too!"
5,Great-Must Have,"Great songs. A must have for any Patty Smyth fan. Downtown Train, The River Cried and Heartache Heard Round The World standout. A CD that will be played over and over again."
3,"camile story, not hilda...","this is an ok, relaxing hurricane show, (especially if u wish for @ least 2 fun trop. storms/mo.). It has clips of camile on ms. gulf coast w/ a few storylines."
1,Bye bye battery,"Beware. I bought this case because it advertised that it held the camera and had a pocket for extra battery or memory card. Well, if you open the camera case the extra battery falls out. There is no way that the pocket could be intended for a battery or a memory card. It is very large and it doesn't hold it in at all. It seems sturdy enough and my camera fits fine. You'd have to be crazy to think this was a safe way to keep your memory card or very expensive battery safe. Premium case, I think not!"
2,zipper ripped out of it in about a month,"I was excited about this product until I actually started using it. There was nowhere else to put an extra memory card, battery, or even my license! The zipper ripped right out from the case in less than a month. I wouldn't waste your money. Go for a long lasting leather case instead."
3,"Not what I really expected, but OKAY","Bigger than I expected, I have a sony w-100 and the case is 2 big for my camera, I put it in the straps sections, but it still moves around so I have to put it in the section designed, for memory cards and batteries! HMM ITS BIG AND CHUNKY/BULKY-- not really what I expected.. .. I dont like the metal thing to attach it to your belt loop. to big...I DONT LIKE THE SIZE AND TEXTURE OF IT, BUT AS LONG AS IT DOES ITS JOB IN PROTRECTING MY PRECIOUS AND EXPENSIVE CAMERA , ILL KEEP IT!"
3,Camera case too big,"Review said it was made for a cybershot dsc-t100, but the camera slides around inside. Product is sturdy."
5,Great product,"My kids are always playing with my digital camera and dropping it. With this case, it keeps the camera safe and secure."
2,Jumped the shark,"I have read every book in this series and I think the last few have not been up to the early high standard. The plots have gotten away from the original idea of antique dealer/amateur slueth, which I really enjoyed.I found the whole premise of Rei working for a fictional undercover agency ridiculous. I find very annoying the inclusion of the description and label of every garment Rei wears."
4,Yet Another Great Rei Book,"In this new adventure, the reader has the opportunity to read on the makings of a new spy. How carefully the cover story and the training have to be develop a ""personality profile"". Then, the reader is allowed to stoll in the poshiest department store in Japan, thru the cover of Rei as an employee. Its a delightful book that grabs your attention since the first page. Rei's character is growing older and more complex. Yes she has made a lot of mistakes, but to me that is what makes her more interesting and fresh...i never know how she is going to react! That is what keeps me reading.There is something to be said about the careful description of garment labels. It is a very Japanese thing to do; it seems many Japanese are enamored about couture names. It is only normal that our Rei Shimura is also very interested in them too!I am eagerly awaiting for the next book!"
3,Rei is getting off the mark,"I have read all of the Rei Shimura books and have enjoyed all but the last two tremendously. Rei is an engaging and surprising character--completely unstereotypical, as are her interesting parents and family. But, it was extremely disappointing that the relationship with Hugh ended, and Rei's character and the plotlines are increasingly problematical. I do not believe Rei as an undercover operative and Michael is too boring a character for words. There are so many interesting adventures Rei could have. Why not make her a reporter for a bilingual US/Japan magazine? She could develop into an art consultant and extend the series in that direction. How about a brief (tragic?) marriage to a Japanese man? Rei's self-absorption and character flaws grow increasingly irksome as she enters her 30's. Time to grow up. Hugh was the perfect foil for Rei--bring him back, please!"
5,pretty for the price,Just received my rose quartz chip bracelet. It was all of $1.99 and it is a cute chip bracelet; I'm quite satisfied.
5,Need new version,Is there ever going to be a Downhill Domination 2? Love this game and would like to see more of it.
4,its alrite,i bought this game because it looked cool and it was but i didnt like that you can't create ur own rider you can only custimized the bike u ride most levels are easy but towards the end they get more difficult.
1,doesnt play,"I use to play this game all the time at my cousins and I loved it so I bought it. Well the one I recieved doesnt play in my ps2 even tho all my other games play in it. So, somethings wrong with the game. If I had kept the paper that came with the box I would have returned it!!! Not very happy with it at all!"
2,Not accurate to compare to SSX; SSX is much better,"Although I currently own only 2 games (SSX and DOA2), I am always on the lookout for new games to purchase. I had seen the commercial on TV for Downhill Domination which looked great & read the Amazon reviews which were all outstanding.However once I started playing the game, I realized that Downhill just isn't as fun a game as SSX or SSX Tricky. Although the graphics are awesome and it does give you a rush of adrenaline speeding down a mountain, there were too many things I didn't like:1. Blood: Call me old fashioned but it's not necessary to be so bloody when a rider crashes off his bike. If anything, it's a distraction.2. Limited course selection: I understand that you have to work your way up to the advanced courses but the courses that are available as a default get repetitive after a while.I could probably keep going with this list but after all is said and done, I was disappointed with this game overall. Overall grade: C+"
5,Are These Guys Crazy?,"I can't believe these other reviews of Catfish Cafe. It was one of the best novels I've read in years and I read a lot. It is funny, sad, and poignant. The milieu Emerson delves into in the African-American community in Seattle is fascinating and, from what I know of it, accurate. The relationship between Luther and his children was well-drawn and intriguing. I really believe the previous critic who said this was boring was bored because he or she didn't want to read about poor African-Americans. Yet, Emerson has really disected this family. I found them fascinating. It worked as a mystery, but it worked better as a novel. I've read only one other Thomas Black novel but you can bet I'm going to read more. This guy is good."
3,NOT HIS BEST,"Book started okay, but then seemed muddled... and author seemed in last couple chapters just wanted to wrap up the finish.Kind of a let down....I bought a couple more of his books at same time, will give them another shot."
2,Boring.,"This is the first book I have read by Emerson. Although it's a small book, it was a difficult read. The writing was a bit stale and uninteresting. There's not a lot going on in this book besides rather straight and to-the-point storytelling. There were a lot of characters--too many to keep track of--suffering from under-development.In some parts of the novel, I found it difficult to track who was saying what because the thoughts and/or actions of one character were contained in the same paragraph as the dialogue of another character. A small complaint, maybe. But when carried on over a few pages, this style of dialogue writing is unnecessarily confusing and cramps the novel's flow.I may read another Emerson book, to give him a fair ""shake"", but it will be much lower on my reading list."
2,not good,"It is not a easy and friendly product... it is cost low, but it does not fit the expectations that i had when i saw the details of the product, i do not recommended it"
2,insatifecho,"Este arciulo NO CUMPLE CON MIS ESPECTATIVAS,HAY QUE ESTAR CONTINUAMENTE CARGANDOLO.LA DURACION DE GARGA DURA MUY POCO"
1,Sent it back,The product was very hard to set up and the set-up disk that came with it was infected with a virus that downloaded on to my computer.
5,Best book yet!,"I've read quite a few of Ms. Byrd's books, and this is, unequivocally, her BEST!!! I had to force myself not to finish reading this book in one sitting. The all too familiar Cinderella tale was told with class and true love. The characters' stories (main and supporting) were woven like fine tapestry. There's just gotta be a sequel, Ms. Byrd...and I can't wait!!!"
5,Unforgettable!!!!,"I really enjoyed this book. Written in true ""Byrd"" style, this book was funny, touching, and thought-provoking. Handsome Marcel Taylor is finally tired of the ""game"". With the assistance of his best friend he's determinded to find the one. Diana, his ever faithful assistant has had a crush on Marcel for the longest time but, she never felt she had a chance against the bevy of beautiful women Marcel is normally seen with. With the assistance of her sick grandmother and her best friend she's determinded to have Marcel, if only for one night"
5,excellent material for all forest activists,"Forest activists often hear the argument, ""What is Old Growth?"" This book helps to distinguish these valuable ecosystems. The book covers everything from fauna and flora that habitat these areas to the spiritual value of the remaining old growth in the Eastern United States.This book is essential for activists and ecologists everywhere."
1,worthless,"My Weim/lab mix ate the ENTIRE toy in less than a day. Not worth the money. I was hoping it would last for a week, but less than a day? Get real."
3,Quado dog toy,"My two boys really loved these Quado chewies, but I was disappointed that they didn't last longer. They probably lasted 30 minutes. For the price, I thought this was pretty fast."
3,I thought this was a toy!,I thought this treat was a toy and so I gave one to one of my dogs and I went out for about 15 minutes and I came back in to one prong left total!! I was freatking out! She did vomit later but it wasn't to bad. I would have LOVED this to be a toy!! LOVE the shape but it's WAY to big for an edible! This was bought for Springers. I suggest to people out there that want to buy this to break off each prong and give one prong to your dog. If you can't make a toy then how about a smaller version treat?
1,Not worth the price,"My tiny 25-pound dog devoured this in 10 minutes! Sure, she enjoyed it, but I had expected it to last for at least 3-4 days, not 10 lousy minutes! I feel like I was duped. I realize my little ""mut"" is a powerful chewer, but she only weighs 25 pounds. I thought a bone designed for a big dog would last her a while. A large dog would probably finish this off in 30 seconds. If you can afford to give your dog something that she won't even remember an hour later, then go ahead and buy this. If you want your dog to have a long, enjoyable treat...don't waste your money on this product."
2,Does not last more than a few hours,"I have a Great Pyrenees who ate half of this in an hour. Do not buy this for chewers, it will not last."
5,Great for chewers without a big mess,"I get these for my dog. He is a big chewer, and he loves to get to work on the quado bone. I get the ginormous. It lasts him about 35-45 minutes (which is good for him). I like these because they chew completely away without leaving a big mess like the busy bones. Also, with rawhide, he has a tendency to chew for a little while and then swallow a big section without having chewed it. Not good upon exit. =0)"
2,Gone in under ten minutes,"While my dog enjoyed this chew very much, he devoured the whole thing in under ten minutes. 40 pound Australian Shepherd that I would not describe as a particularly aggressive chewer, finished the 'average' says much faster than I expected. I thought the material would be harder and more difficult for them to break off pieces. It's probably great for small dogs, but too much money for something I wanted to last for much longer."
1,Not for big dogs,My dog ate this way too fast. Maybe if it was cheap it would be worth it but it is NOT worth the price for how long it lasts. Don't waste your money buying this if your dog is an aggressive chewer or if they weigh more than 30 lbs
3,Dog enjoyed it,"I had hoped that maybe this ""ginormous"" bone would last a little bit longer, but my 95-pound Husky mix ate the entire thing in less than 15 minutes! She seemed to really enjoy it, though, so I guess that's good!"
4,A big hit!,"Our 10 week old English Bulldog puppy absolutely LOVES this bone. Right now it's lasting a few days, probably due to his small size. I'm sure once he gets older, it won't be around for as long. I would rate this product 5 stars, but sadly the bone doesn't last as long as I would like it to for the price. Great product, really loved by our ball of wrinkles."
2,"I love Lupin, not the game","Horrible camera. Its so hard to even move, let alone actually play the game. I interface is awful. Whenever you bring up the menu in order to check inventory, switch costumes, its just cheaply made."
3,"My cap is not off to ""The Pirates of Capri""","I'm a fancier of the Louis Hayward swashbuckler, but ""The Pirates of Capri"" disappointed me. Hayward is quite engaging in a Scarlet Pimpernel-type role, but the film is marred by overdubbed Italian performances and a plot that's just so-so. This film transfer on this DVD release is good, by the by.Instead of ""Capri"", consider Haywards' ""The Black Arrow"", ""Son of Monte Cristo"", or ""The Man in the Iron Mask""."
3,catchy song,"Tevin Campbell is one of the Best Singers to Emerge over the past 20 years&songs like this showcase His range.this was a catchy New Jack Swing inspired cut.Al B.Sure on Production with Chubb Rock on the Hook Rap. this cut was used in the film ""Boyz in the hood"".it was a catchy track.Tevin Campbell always had range."
4,Great Product,"This is an excellent little party light, its super bright and really adds to the whole party experience. If you're trying to get the club/disco party effect, I recommend this light. The only thing that stopped me from rating it 5 stars was the fact that this light get really hot when in use."
1,Didn't Work,"Bought this item through Musician's Friend. I took it out of the box and plugged it in. Nothing. I then had to take it apart and found that the hot glue used to seal the 120v connections had caused the wire connection to the AC plug to not make contact. This fixed I then found that the first light would light, but the color bank would not sequence. Evidently this unit had never been tested before it was shipped from the factory! I didn't even bother to send it back. It wasn't worth the trouble. Maybe I can use the bulbs. At least they worked. I'll probably never buy another Chauvet product again."
4,Stage Helper,"I have opened a Non-Profit Teen center in Picayune, MS and I needed lighting for our stage - the Chauvet Color Bank fit the requirement well. I ordered two of them to project from the back of the stage into the crowd and it worked really well."
4,Adequate,"Works adequately for the price. Controls are too sensitive. It goes from very slow to very fast with little knob movement. When desired position is located, it works fine."
1,Very Unhappy Customer,"I purchased this product on August 3..When I recieved it my bulbs where broke...I ordered this product earlier enough 2 recieve it 4 a party that i am having on August 29,but yet to recieve the replacement bulbs....."
3,Love Potion #9,This fragrance is more masculine than feminine. The fond memories of yesterday did not live up to the reality of today. I would not buy this again for myself.
3,"Awesome Album, Few Skips","Was overall pleased with this album, unfortunately there are a lot of fine scratches on the record and i came across a few skips. Still listenable overall."
3,For FF fans,"Well, I've played Crisis Core and now I'm playing FFVII in my PSP, and this movie helped me to feel all the drama. It's well done, but not for beginners or people who doesn't know the FF universe."
5,AMAZING!!!!,One word Amazing!!! This movie is what people wanted when the first Final Fantasy movie came out. The graphics make you drool and the story stays true. It will make you remember things about the game you forgot and if you didn't play it you would still love it. I think this is in my top anime list and it might be hard to push it out.
3,"Great movie, Weak story, Sub-par DVD",Good:Probably the best CGI i have ever seenSome of the best fight seens in existenceJapanese voice acting is quite goodSound effects rivaling (if not surpassing) great moviesMost of the special features are included in the SE US releaseBad:Story lacks depthFor people who have never played FFVII the story will be confusingEnglish voice acting is HORRIBLE.. not the re-animation we were promised.. instead they just gave us bad voice oversUgly yellow subtitlesWhat happened to Final Fantasy - Lost Order? Lost in translation?
2,get a grip fanboys,"im a huge fan of final fantasy, and 7 in particular... so when i was informed that a film final fantasy film was in production i was exstatic. After viewing the film though, i must say i am very dissapointed. Sure the visuals are unparalled and the score is up there with epics such as star wars, but jesus christ what went wrong with the plot. it seems that the main reason of the film is to cram as much reference from the game as possible to keep the fans happy. the story is confused and the action scenes are completely over the top. it was nice to see my favourite characters from the game in 2 minute cameos though. This had the potential to be huge. pity...roll on dirge of cerebus."
2,Disappointed,"The corners of the item was very damaged. It was bent and colors were rubbed off.As I bought this item in 'new' condition, it definitely seemed used with a packaging over it."
2,It's missing the 30min animated feature,"I've seen the Japanese version of this. In the Japanese version, there's an extra 30min hand-animated (an in not CG) prequel, that was absolutely excellent. It was much better than the main feture imo. Unfortunately, Squeenix (Square/Enix) has decided to screw us over, and not release it over here. Well, to that I say SCREW YOU Squeenix!! I will not be buying this tripe.Wait for the Super-Extra Bonus Edition, or whatever, to come out, that will include the 30min extra."
3,EYE CANDY FOR THE PLOT IMPAIRED,"this movie was just decent. i can't slam it because the graphics and cool action scenes kept my attention, but i guess it's my turn to beat this dead horse. the plot was about as vauge as a blind person explaining details to a sketch artist. hopefully the advent children video game for the new system will bridge the gaps. for now i will continue to enjoy ff10; the next best thing to ff7."
1,What,"The entire FF series pisses me off. The one thing i hate most is the timeless timeline. they have guns and swords, horses and motorcycles. and now to the film. No story, No character styling and the only thing, the only thing it has going for ir are the stolen graphics from Spirits Within."
1,What Happened?,I liked Final Fantasy - the Spirits Within.This is not even close.This is a sequel rip-off - kiddy cartoon crap.
2,Very disappointing...,"As a true lover of Final Fantasy VII for Playstation, I was eager to put my hands on this movie and bring back some memories.After having seen the film, I came up to be very disappointed, because of one simple thing: this is not cinema, it's just an exercise of style.While I do agree with the fact that the graphics and the coreography is somewhat stunning and breathtaking, the music is well done, what truly lacks is the screenplay.If someone has not played FF7 the plot will be totally inconsistent.As I've played it I can say:""The plot could be done MUCH MUCH better"".The story is slow and painfully confusing, there is no true reason for the coming of Sephiroth in the scene (well... the only usephul phrase to understand this is ""come back into my dreams""), the whole plot is almost meaningless.If I could give an advice to the artists, I'd say this: less computers and more logic."
3,"wonderful animation, terrible story development","THe animation in FF7 Advent Children is simply gorgeous. It is the best I have ever seen point blank. It starts where the game stopped, and the dvd even has an extra feature to refresh those who havent played the game in awhile or not at all, so everyone can enjoy it. Unfortunately, that is where the good ends. The story focuses way too much on Cloud and Tifa's relationship and the other characters we came to love get the back burner and appear as cameos for a big battle, and that's it. Plus, for a truly good companion movie to the epic game, it really needed to be about two or three hours longer than it was. The whole thing felt rushed, and leaves the viewer wishing for more. Save your money and rent this one before you go out and buy it, it was a nice try but it is just lacking in too many ways. The only reason I give it three stars is because I loved the game so much."
4,Great BLu Ray,"A damm good BD edition of Final Fantasy: Advent Children, that's for sure! The only thing missing is s Collector's Edition."
4,Action-Packed Fan Service,"This movie is very excellent, if you happen to be a Final Fantasy fan. The thrill of character cameos is underwhelming if you don't know the characters from Final Fantasy VII. However, it's not too hard to follow if you're unfamiliar with the cast----it just takes away the fan service aspect of the film. It's very well-made and entertaining from start to finish. The only downfall is its dependency on the game's story, which a lot of people may not know."
4,Good CGI movie on Bluray,"I liked advent children as it came out back then on dvd, but this one is much more enhanced. Picture quality is stunning and the images seem very very sharp and precise although it is a remake of the same movie released a while back. Packaging is good and the cover makes it worthy to sit on a collector's shelf. Don't expect to find any leaflets or accompanying booklets though as there are none. However, it more than makes up for that by including some awesome extras on disc. The movie itself has been extended with more depth and reason to the story. Japanese voice acting is excellent, while the English one... well, not as great, but a good attempt in any case. You also get a sneak preview of the upcoming FF game and reminescence of FF7 videos. All in all, this is a good buy for any fan of the FF7 game / story."
5,"Amazing quality, reinforced story line, beautifully put together","Incredible on blu-ray high definition. Extra movie scenes were well worth it; and can tell that some of the old scenes were slightly changed to accomodate modified edits. Sound quality ended up so-so, but still a stunner. Much of the chain-of-events make more sense now."
5,It rocks every second of the way,"I saw the japanese version with english subtitles...and damn. I could tell that the animators agreed to make every single second of the movie as brilliant as the last. And indeed, the movie is everything I expected and more. If your main concern is the same as mine was before I saw it: ""will the movie really be good?"" then you can rest easy, because its awesome. You won't be dissappointed. Matrix my butt, this movie's fight scenes are much better. I only wish there were more of the movie to watch, but oh well, all good things come to an end. Thank you Square Enix for making this awesome movie."
5,Holy cow! one of the best movies I have ever seen in years! for a Final Fantasy VII based on the game!,"I watched the import and I was stunned at the CG scenes very detailed! PlayStation 3 anyone? And the score to this movie will kick you in the face! Also a good story.Its not anything like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.. .And the graphics or CG scenes are simpley amazing! Japan is good at the CG scenes and voice dialog etc.Awsome!!.And all the FFVII are in this movie ""I won't tell you anymore details your just going to have to buy this Killer dvd SE!..when its released in USA A++++++++"
4,Best CG Movie of 2005,"This was imho the best CG movie of the year. As an avid Final Fantasy fan, I can say that if you've played the original game you MUST see this movie.I'm sure many of you have seen the blasphemy that was The Spirits Within. If you're expecting it to be as boring and overdramatic... no. Each scene is filled with action and blessed eye-candy, and I must say this was worth the seven or eight year wait (since the original PlayStation game). The plot IS deep, and fills in nearly all of the plot-holes the original game left open.I do wish SQEX would have used the other characters more (ie. Cid, Yuffie, Barret, Vincent, Red XII, and Reeve/Cait Sith), however with all of the pluses to this movie I would hardly consider the lack of appearences from the other characters a huge drawback.Even if you haven't played the game, you will be pleased by all you see. I suggest this to everyone looking for a good action or CG movie. It really is just that awesome."
4,Great Movie but,"Great movie with awesome action and great graphics for its time. The plot is a little difficult to understand if you haven't played the game, but it still has a great theme nevertheless.The special edition isn't that special; besides the ""making of the movie"" part, the deleted scenes weren't that special etc."
5,DVD,I don't even know where to being with this movie. I am a really huge Final Fantasy fan...all the Fantasy from movies and games as well. It was Fantastic. Dvd came on time and in great shape...thanks once again
4,Advent Children Complete a better experience then the original cut,"Advent Children in a nutshell is the sequel CG movie to the 1997 video game Final Fantasy VII. Advent Children Complete is a director's cut that includes an extra 30 minutes of scenes that really help make story more understandable, enjoyable and a better viewing experience overall. This movie overall is light on story and more focused on action and if that is what you are looking for then you will probably enjoy this film. If your a FFVII fan then you probably already watched it or have it on DVD and depending on how big of a FFVII fan you are may want to get this director's cut of Advent Children.Visually this CG film still looks great after a few years with the new scenes having noticeably better lighting then the original footage.There are extras like an overview of the 1997 video game as well as the compilation of games surrounding the franchise. There are trailers as well as packed onto the disc."
3,The movie looks good and everything.,"Wish the movie was longer (the rest of the FF7 cast make cameos at the end of the movie) to fight a creature their attacks seem uselessagainst (except Cloud's). I'd have liked to have seen more of them through outthe film (but it was mostly about Cloud). The second disk was junk. Could have had a second movie/all kinds of goodies. Instead, bits & piece like a few deleted scenes etc. Well at least it was ""Final Fantasy,"" unlike that crappy Spirits Within. A.C. just left me wanting more, but the visuals/action/voice acting were A+."
4,Final Fantasy Advent Children box,"I was a bit disappointed with this purchase. The ""script"" wasn't what I expected and seems to have no real rhyme or reason. I can't follow it nearly as well as its Japanese counterpart which I already have. The postcards are cool and even though I already have the DVD, I don't mind a backup copy for gifts or such. I'm still thinking about the ""story"" about Tifa and Denzel and Barret though. It seems like a pourly written fanfiction explaining these characters' actions just before Advent Children begins. I must confess, I would have liked more on Cloud dealing with his geostigma instead."
5,"0m9 PH1N@l f4nta5Y vi1 1s THE roxX0rzzZ1111!!!!11 clouD 0Wn5 y0Ur 50Ul !!!!!!!""","1 SUPPo5e iF +H3Y C@n M4K3 4 ""n3V3R3nd1N9 $T0Ry 11,"" +hey C@N m4k3 A ""Ph1NAl f4n+45y Vi1."""
2,"Awesome movie, packaged in a VERY low quality disc case.","I'm not going to talk about the movie that much. The only thing I'll say about the movie is that if you're a huge FF7 fan, you'll love this movie for sure.I just want to give a warning about the Blu Ray version.It seems that Sony is using very cheap Blu Ray disc cases now. They're called ""Vortex Eco-Lite"" cases. These are VERY VERY low quality. They're made of a very flimsy plastic, and the one that specifically arrived to me seemed to be damaged in production, as the case was VERY scratched up and ripped underneath the vacuum-sealed plastic and the front of the case seemed deformed because it bent inwards towards the actual disc.If you're a die-hard Blu Ray collector who wants your discs to be perfectly protected and/or wants a clean looking movie shelf, these new disc cases will disappoint."
3,"Animation Good, Story Direction Bad","The animation and fight scenes were good, but the story itself seemed misguided. Not worth buying, just rent or watch, I already bought it though."
5,Awesome on Blu-Ray,"If you liked the original and appreciate better visuals and sound, this is going to do the trick. Simply looks amazing in 1080p, high-def makes a big difference for animated pictures. Pixar needs to take some notes."
4,Great,Liked the DVD. Only recommend for fans. A couple of my friends watched it who hadn't played the game and enjoyed the action but didn't really understand anything else going on. I was disappointed that the English DVD didn't have the bonus anime that the Japanese had.
5,CGI masterpiece,This movie is so GREAT!! I loved every minute of it. It brought back so many memories. I may have to go buy the game again. The fight scenes are fast paced and exciting to watch. The voices are just right for the characters. The only small glitch it between the voiceovers and lip movement. But that is to be expected. If you loved the game you'll love the movie. No fan should be without it.
3,"Is it ""complete""?","Video quality is better than DVD. Those extra minutes does not add too much but it's ok. And it's awfull how the English audio does not fit with character's mouth. Must see in japanesse. Too bad it does not include Spanish audio... So, for $7.99 it's ok."
3,Good But Not Great,"This movie was full of characters from most of the popular FF games, but lacked a true story line. Was easy on the eyes but heavy on the wallet. Will wait until a real full feature movie of FF flair comes to air and proves to be worth purchasing."
3,You should at least rent it.,"I was needlessly ""hyped"" over the Final Fantasy VII movie. I was a fan of the first game, and a movie version seemed to be a dream come true. However, there was little new in the movie, and even so it seemed fan service. Only a dedicated fan would appreciate it. Other passerby would only stop, curious, just to see the graphics. However, there is little else to recommend it."
2,Needs and editor,"I have the Japanese edition of this movie as well and I have to agree that it needs some heavy editing. I played the game and I still found its obvious lack of proper editing more than a little annoying.Now, obviously, this movie is targeted at a niche market, otherwise there would be better back-story build-up. So, on the one hand, if you're a fan of the videogames, by all means, pick this up.On the other hand, if you're a casual fan, you'll find this to be mediocre at best. You may find the artwork to be alright but it's not even the best of its genre -- to put it in perpsective, the original Ghost in the Shell's artwork was better."
3,"Beautiful, but plot absolutely rancid","Okay, the first thing that I want to point out is that this is a very beautiful anime. The animation is mind-blowing and should get the respect it deserves.But, beyond that, the plot totally sucks. The creative team behind this basically digs at the bottom of the plot barrel to cook up a scenario where one of those Jenova-infused clone people touches a piece of Jenova then *POOF!* becomes Sephiroth and remembers everything he did so he and Cloud can fight for half an hour. I suppose this makes sense to someone who's just gotten done watching Dragon Ball all the way through, but it kind of detracts from the quality of the anime."
5,Amazing,An amazing file and I do have to agree that you'd probably get lost if you didn't play the game at all. You'll be wondering who's who and who these other people are and what's going on a lot. There's a couple of places in it where the timeline becomes non-linear which will confuse a lot of people but it's easy to pick up on.Definantly worth the money.
2,A very big dissapointment.,"You'll be getting all the information on Fnial Fantasy 7 from most of the other writers, so I'll go straight for the gut. The largest flaws in this movie are the action sequences which are poorly directed and often difficult to follow. I know FF7 has always sported some incredibly bombastic moves and ""Limits"" from its characters but this film presents its fight sequences as if they were Dragon Ball Z (which isnt a show anyone should be emmulating in the first place) knock offs. I truly hated these choppy fight sequences, they really marred the rest of this otherwise good film. The poor translation on the subtitles just add to the corny vibe of the fight scenes. I say watch this with this in mind and try to enjoy our FF7 character in updated graphics."
2,"Nice to look at, but boring.","Ok, so we all pretty much have seen this already, why even release it on DVD over here? duh........anyway, I found this movie to be really boring and it didn't make too much sense. The visuals are extremely good however. I'm also not a huge Final Fantasy fan, so maybe that factors into my rating as well."
1,MATRIX XII,"ONE MORE movie PLAGUIARISING THE MATRIX.Hence, it's again mainly Matrix fight scenes. Mimicing MATRIX, trying to be THE MATRIX.Dooming what should be a most original cinema experience to the worst FAILURE of STUDIO dumbing-down for commercialism.As soon as I watched the FF7 game scenes, 'Reminiscence,' I took a breath and said: That's it, where was it?"
2,Not so awesome!,"This movie was rather disappointing. In fact I found myself enjoying the begining where they replayed major scenes from the game more than much of the film. The plot was very predictable and the dialogue and voice acting were very bad; scratch that, incredibly bad. The one thing that is worthwhile is the animation. The animation was indeed very impressive, but the other elements were so unbearable that the film was still hard to finish. With this installment of Final Fantasy you get a visual feast and excrement for plot. If you only care about visuals then this movie is great; if you care about plot, dialogue, character development, acting (voice acting in this case), or any of the other elements that it takes to make a great film you might want to skip this release."
5,If you love FFVII,"Then this is the movie you've been waiting for...All we need now is an expanded version...Another few hours would've been fine!Be prepared to see some old favorite characters, beautifully rendered. Made me go back and play certain parts of the game."
5,worth the wait on blue-ray,"This movie will be the new way you demonstrate your new HD-TV theater system, filled with high resolution shoots and high clarity on the audio that makes u say ""wow O_O"". This version of Advent Children defiantly told a much better in-depth story than its predecessor,with extra small scenes where it simply explains the characters motives to longer fighting scenes that makes the action just way more intense.The ending of the movie was much better,& more brutal,than the simple ""stabbing in the shoulder"" from the last one. A+ movie :)"
5,Fantastic!,"Definitely worth it for bluray! Picture looks incredible, but the sound could have been better. Plus there's 30 extra minutes of additional footage. To be honest I don't think it helps nor helps the movie, but it's a nice bonus. If you like Final Fantasy VII, this is a no brainer."
5,Must buy for hardcore Final Fantasy Fans!,"Just as the product description says, this lovely collection has postcards, a script, a novel, and it contains Last Order on Disc 2!It's all in a very well made case that looks great anywhere!Looks great between FFVII and FFVIII"
4,One small problem...,"This movie is perfect, at least the Japanese version of it. A must for any fan regardless, but the one problem is the english voice overs. I must say, they're horrible. The japanese voices were different and a little more appropriate. Too bad they just couldn't use the same voice actors if they would have known english. The character sound a little stupid in the english version and makes it seem like a cheesy after school special, but the movie itself is a keeper."
4,It was good,good video if you really like final fantasy this is for you. It was just overall a good cgi flick.
5,simply amazing!,Simply amazing it is! Sure it doesn't come with the FFXIII demo like the japanese verson but the quality and new added scenes in the movie make this REALLY complete.I'm not left hanging like the original Advent Children when it came out back in '05.STUNNING in 1080p! A must have for any FFVII fan!It even comes with a 30 minute anime feature of Denzel's past.
3,Not a Fan of the Game; Movie is Just Fine (3.5),"In advance I want to let everyone know I'm not an expert on this film but I enjoyed it nevertheless. ""Advent Childen"" is one of those movies that caters more to the devoted followers of the ""Final Fantasy"" series, and even more so to those in love with ""Final Fantasy VII"". They will know all the details and everything like it's nobodies business, and good for them. To me the film is eye candy, spectacular action, polished CGI, complete with gravity defying stunts. The movie assumes you are somewhat familiar with everyone and familiar with that world. The point of my review is that even if you aren't, it's still a fun movie to look at."
3,EHHHH,"First of all lets just say, if you haven't played FF7/ Beaten it, its not worth watching. I have had the wonderful oppurtunity to play this game, and really absorb the story. This movie how ever i feel falls very short of my expectations of what it should be. im not a video game fan , or a hard core gamer, i just loved my experience with FF7 and i feel its the best game ever created.This movie completely fails in its plot/ story line. Its very dry, and some of the terminology they use in the plot (english version) seems very unrealistic (i understand translations are usually a little wack). I felt some scenes felt had no relivance in the movie either.Im giving it 3 stars ,because i've been anticipating more FF7 for years after i played it, and finally something is being released. Also the sheer beauty of the Graphics (dont no what else to call it), is just amazing, i think its very ahead of its time. Looks good with a high def Television. The Sound is pretty good too."
2,Interesting for fanboys and action lovers,"While film looks and sounds amazing, the plot is mediocre at best. Fun to watch, but would be boring for those not familiar with Final Fantasy VII."
5,"Didn't play FF7, but...uh...THIS ROCKS!","This seems to be in a love-it-or-hate-it category. Myself, I LOVED IT! Amazing CGI, flowing score, and some of the best action scenes since...well..ever. Sometimes the DVD glitched (DAMN YOU, BLOCKBUSTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) but other than that, nothing tore me away from this movie than to get some popcorn. I'd never even heard of FF before I watched the movie, but I got the general gist of it all enough to love it. Square Enix has a very good thing going for them and should probably keep this momentum strong before releasing FF12 (I did some research, OK?) ROCK ON, SQUARE ENIX!! Peace out."
3,some things are lacking,"First off... the cgi is absolutely beautiful.Now to why this only got three stars from me. This movie is close to two hours long, and in that time I feel that there was almost no movement in the story. It is almost completely filled with overdone fight scenes, and in focusing on the fights there are places where you end up scratching your head because something just happens with no explanation as to how or why.Also the story itself is fairly flat. Where there was the oppertunity to have some depth, it wasn't exploited. This left me a little disappointed since I am a huge fan of the games, and I know that the story writers are capable of much more.In the end, if you're a fan if the FF series it's probably worth buying. Or if you really want to see excellent cgi, it's worth it. But if you don't play the games or have another reason to buy it you'll most likely be disappointed."
1,"God, this movie sucked.","I can't beleive a lot of people were waiting years for this piece of junk. This could of been released in a week. Don't they know the Matrix got old already? This is nothing but stupid unrealistic action with people literally flying and the slow motion to boot. Advent Children is no where near as cool as it thinks it is.Bottom line, this movie has disappointment written all over it. And even hardcore Final Fantasy 7 fans who won't admit it, will get bored of it soon. There is one scene that stands out as even more ridiculous than the rest and that's hard to accomplish trust me. It's where cloud jumpes into the air and flys up for miles and miles I mean the scene takes like 5 minutes. It gets better the other FFVII characters all happend to be on higher ground and as cloud reaches each one of them, they give him a hand by grabbing his hand and tossing him up higher."
1,So absurd,"instead of using a PSP emulator on the PC... noinstead of remaking the game on a new console or PC with added values ,noit's all ridiculous, that's my opinion...more consoles then games i always say..."
2,"5 star CGI, and NO storyline","If you are a PS2 Final Fnatasy gamer, then you'll most likely understand this movie.Otherwise... continue reading.The CGI in this movie is just amazing. Of course. It was done with Maya 7 Unlimited with custom plug-ins. But, the storyline was so weak that it didn't make sense in making a movie.Even Appleseed which had ""3D anime"" concepts, had a better storyline. It was average, but 100 better than ""Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children.""I give this movie 2 stars because of the CGI. If that wasn't a factor most likely would be 1 star."
2,Not what I expected,"There were way too many pointless and utterly unrealistic action sequences and not enough plot development. It felt like it was just thrown together, as it hardly made any sense. The CG is very nice to look at, and the music was good, but that's about all AC has going for it. Save your money."
1,An exercise in stupidity.,"I have played final fantasy 7 for hundreds of hours, loved it and consider it one of the greatest story driven games ever. Final Fantasy 7 stands taller than any other turn-based RPG. So, I had high expectations for the movie. It was a huge letdown. The characters seem to have far less personality and dimension than the game's characters. The events seem to have no cohesiveness - even understanding who the characters were it wasn't clear what their motivation was. The CG was superb technically but it seemed like some of the environments were inspired by later Final Fantasy games (too heavily doused in Japanese pop culture). In the end it just seemed like the director tried to generate interest by blasting the screen with ridiculous fight scenes where no one cares of the outcome."
5,Great Story line and game,"I've been a Final Fantasy fan for quite a while now and FFVII has been the best by my opinion so far. The storyline is based on life and captures the essence of living, death, and how to cherish what you have in life exceptionally well. The animation of the Square Enix team is fantastic and never seizes to amaze. Also, the movie lines up with the game perfectly, capturing each individual character dead accurately, 5 stars for this movie. And 5 stars to the packaging and shipping also!"
5,Amazing!,"Don't pass up! I had the DVD which looked great, but the Blu Ray looks amazing! Pick this up if you are a fan of Final Fantasy 7!"
4,Nice Blu-Ray,"Overall, you get what you pay for. A HD version of Final Fantasy Advent Children. This version adds additional footage which, I think, make the movie better. The only negative thing about the blu-ray is that the case seems weaker and thinner than traditional blu-ray cases and there is no insert with the movie. Other than that, this blu-ray is a great buy for anyone who is a fan of FFVII and HD movies."
2,why?,"...........thats really all i can say about this. it hasn't even been a year since the special edition came out and they are already trying to milk it for all its worth. from reading the item description all your getting is a new cover and a couple of cheap little bonus items, like postcards, amazing. i'm a big ff fan, but i just can't recommend this. just save some money and buy the special edition. you can probably buy it for about $10 and get the exact same experience."
3,Final Fantasy,The DVD was in great shape it just took really long to receive it. I understand that I received it within the dates specified. I have purchased quite a few items from Amazon.com and this has got to be the one that took the longest to receive. You can say that I was a bit disappointed. But like I said the DVD was in great shape.
1,"Looks Fantastic, but where is the plot?","The visuals in this film are astounding. Everything else is awful. The plot is pretty much nonsense and full of holes, the script is terrible and cheesey all the way through. The acting is just as bad. There are a few tiny redeeming features but the badness of this film by far exceeds everything else. The characters couldn't be any more self-involved unless they were in a soap opera.Don't even try to show it to people who haven't played the game, they won't get any of the in-jokes and will only understand 1% of the film.The biggest wasted opportunity of recent times."
1,Ridiculously vapid fan service,"This is just a CGI display of anime cliches and pointless fan service. FF7 is one of the most overrated things, ever. The story is about as captivating as the lyrics of a Helloween song. The characters are soulless, cardboard-like creatures, masquerading in hideous costumes and spikey hair to influence thousands of cosplayers to further fail at life. There was this scene where the characters were throwing Cloud in the air to hit some flying monster or something, as they issued him sunny encouragement like ""no giving up!"" I just sat there in awe of the stupidity on display, wondering how this cinematic jello inspired its own subculture."
1,Not so good.,This movie is horrible. You wait so long and it's this disappointing. The graphics are amazing and that's about it. The storyline is horrible and it is BORING. I don't know why everyone makes such a big deal over sephiroth he is just a guy in a drench coat. I would not recommend this movie.
4,not too bad,"Could have been a little better, but overall not too bad. This was one of my favorite video games of all time. It was nice to see the story continued."
3,Voice Acting SUCKS!!,"I've seen this movie in Japenese with English Subtitles, and pure English. Even though I had to watch the subtitles, it was MUCH better. The voices suck, just from how they sound and everything. I'll purchase this though for the special featurse, but the japanese original is much better."
3,What happened?,"I just don't get it. You take the greatest selling Final Fantasy game... Probably the gratest game ever, and make a B movie from it. I mean first the spirits within and now this. They could have just made the movie off of The Final Fantasy VII game itself. It was great that all of the characters were there, but maybe it should have been the original and not the sequel."
4,Hard to Follow But Very Entertaining..,"If you are not a fan of Final Fantasy, the game, then you will be totally confused by the plot (I am not a fan, so the first 5 minutes mystified me) but the graphics and action scenes will keep you interested.I would not recommend this to anyone who does not watch alot of anime but Fanal Fantasy VII will be a treat for any fans of shows like ""Dragon Ball Z"". The action in this film is fast and furious, displaying super-human people performing incredible feats of strength and speed.The animation is very similar to another Final Fantasy film, ""The Spirits Within"" - which has the same weaknesses: incredible animation, wacky/convoluted plot. The high quality of the animation is one of this film's saving graces.Final Fantasy VII is packaged as a two disk set, filled with extras, so you get your money's worth. If you are a FF fan, then by all means buy this DVD. Anime fans will enjoy this one as well."
3,"Good, but not Great...","I haven't seen the US release so take this with a grain of salt.The animation is great and it's nice to see Square toning down their all-too-real effect in favor of a slightly animated effect. They still need to work on their storytelling though, especially if it's meant for a younger audience. The plot carries on from the game, but doesn't elaborate enough on what happened to Cloud in between the game and movie as well as ignores some key character relationships and plot twists. While I enjoyed watching it, I felt the script was lacking."
3,thanks!,"This anime movie is good! Unfortunately, almost all other Japan's anime movie without subtitle, sometime not in English or even in other language what I not know..."
4,Worth the trip again...,"I have seen Advent Children a countless number of times and I have to say that the Blu-ray version is worth the extra purchase. Not only does the extra content help the storyline make more sense (the original story almost doesn't make sense), the higher image resolution takes it up a notch further. The ""Complete"" in the title makes sense for this film and it does leave the viewer feeling like the story is resolved. Plus, though the extra content isn't as good as the Japanese version (no FFXIII demo), there is still a really beautiful trailer of Final Fantasy XIII that re-kindled my desire for that game. Overall, a great purchase and worth the extra trip through the world of Advent Children."
5,FF7,"If you enjoyed the game or the series itself, then it is a must have for your collection. It is a great flick, takes me back to the Super Nintendo days."
4,Way cool!,"My wife bought this DVD for me yesterday and it was awesome! The animation is superb! My only problem is that it jumped around a lot making it kind of hard to follow...hence the 4 star rating. But for any FF fan, I highly recommend this DVD."
5,interesting to say the least,ive played the game dozens of times and the movie is still confusing but pretty good. definitaly easy on the eyes
3,Son Was Not Impressed,"I bought this for my son and he said that he was not impressed with it at all. He said it was okay, but he would not recommend it to anyone and they should rent it if they want to play it."
5,"Love, love, love.",This improves upon the original DVD a thousand fold. It is a must see. Don't pass this up. FFVII:AC complete is totally worth it.
3,"good for FF fans, others might want to rent it before purchase","FF AC is a fair movie at best. I cannot deny the gorgeous graphics and vibrant actions (almost too fast for audience to catch up with) are the best out there. But the story is poorly written. The movie is somewhat difficult for fans to follow and leaves its audience a sense of hollowness after watching it. It certainly recalls memories of FFVII, yet if you look beyond the graphics and actions there really is not much left.Any mature audience should be able to spot the problem right away. And for all you FFVII fanatics out there blinded by the superficial features of the movie, grow up please."
2,Confusingly pretty,"I'm not a fan of the Final Fantasy games, so this film was not a trip into a familiar fantasy world for me. I DID see the previous deeply flawed ""Final Fantasy"" motion picture. Like that film, this one has a number of story and pacing problems.I tried. I really did. I have a number of friends who absolutely LOVE the FFVII game that this film expands upon. I'm afraid it just didn't keep my attention.Sure, the animation is top notch, and many of the film's moments are arrestingly unique; but I just never connected to the dozen or so central characters. Too many subplots, too many characters, no central focus to the story."
2,Beautiful...... but OverHyped and Boring at Times,"For all you Final Fantasy fanatics, this is the ultimate fanboy/girls' dream! Although I've only played 2 Final Fantasy games, this movie was somewhat exhilirating, but for most of the movie, I was bored to tears. (Most likely because I've never played FF7; not knowing what the background story is). The CG is amazing, and fight scenes are spectacular. However, what I really loved about this movie was the theme of friendship and standing up to those who threaten your happiness. But otherwise, everything else about it was quite boring."
2,Beautiful but disappointing.,"I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy. Need to say that first. But I'm also a huge fan of film. And aside from Advent Children's technical brilliance, the story and dialogue are sorely lacking.The dialogue is in places laughably bad. The story straightforward and its metaphors cumbersome and obvious. Its creators somehow made me feel LESS invested in the characters I loved while playing the game.It's a brilliant technical achievement, but so little attention was paid to telling a coherent story or crafting entertaining dialogue that in the end I was just hoping it would stop.I can't imagine anyone who hadn't played the game understanding or caring about this at all. As someone who did play the game, I'm left sorely disappointed.For anyone who loved FF7 and just wants to see the characters again, it might be worth a viewing. For everyone else? Meh."
5,AWESOME,"AWESOME, is the only word to discribe this movie. The animation is beautiful, the fight seens are action packed. If your a fan of the Final Fantasy series or an anime fan-GET THIS MOVIE!"
2,"nope,no way!",this really is.......rubbish! im a big fan of all the final fantasy games and i so loved ff7. but the film was a bitter dissapointment.bad-points:- the fighting sequences was just to fast to see what was happining and who was being hit.....bit like kung-fu-hustle with people flying though the air and all other bizzare things! theres no or little magic no summons(which i was expecting) you see very little of sepheroth?all in all i would wait till its in the ?3.99 bin at your local off-licence!! and even then its a rip-off!
5,One of the best animated films I've ever seen,"When I saw this movie, I liked it almost right away. In fact, this is what caused me to become an FF7 fan in the first place. I wasn't clear with the story because I hadn't played Final Fantasy 7 before. Fortunatly, it has an option to watch a type of overview of Final Fantasy 7. It's about twenty five minutes long, but at least I had something go by. Anyhow, the music is excellent, the graphics are really good, and the story is really good. My advice to those who haven't played Final Fantasy 7 is to pay close attention to what's happening, and what the characters are talking about."
5,Extremely entertaining for fans with extras!,"Well if you haven't already seen the movie then definitely watch it if you played the Play Station game. If you already have, this box set has some pretty nifty extras. The script isn't really too interesting, but the post cards can be nice collectibles. Looks great on the shelf."
5,Can you say...awesome?,Best DVD purchase I've made for myself...downloading this one for free will only get you hooked into wanting to buy it feverishly!
5,Do Unto Others Before They Do Unto You...,"This movie is one to put on your list. A comedy of the old west where greed, corruption and lawlessness run rampant! James Coburn who is out to get whatever he can including a maiden's virtues is fantastic in this part. Carrol O'Connor as a wayward sheriff who's more concern for his pocket rather than the law is great as well as Bruce Dern who's at his typical not quite all their best! Roger Miller's music throughout this morality play gone wrong makes this film. This needs to be on DVD!"
5,Not a review but a plea,"Anything I could say has pretty much already been said. This is a hidden treasure. Please please, whoever has the authority to do so, please put this out in a quality DVD edition. I really can't understand why it already isn't. Sadly, James Coburn isn't around anymore to do an audio commentary. I would really like to hear from all the principals what it was like to make this movie."
3,Is Anybody Honest?,"James Coburn is a most likable rascal in a movie where everyone seems to be trying to steal from someone. There are plenty of laughs in this spoof, but the behaviors may not be that far from reality as morality takes a back seat to greed. Carroll O'Connor is great as an amoral sheriff and Margaret Blye is a delight to watch as his often-wronged daughter. The good supporting cast includes Claude Akins, Bruce Dern, James Whitmore, and Joan Blondell. Lightweight fare, but great fun."
3,Waterhole #3,"I hadn't seen this movie in years so I purchased it because I thought it to be a funny movie. After viewing it I realized why this is not a movie widely shown on TV. It's not a bad movie, it's just not a good movie. Coburn is certainly likable as is O'Connor. Margaret Blye is definitely eye candy. But I found the Roger Miller song interjections to be intrusive, distracting & padding. This is a relic of its era; simply Hollywood making the Western irreverent & irrelevant. James Coburn is NOT James Garner who was very successful at doing this. The quality of the DVD is very good but there aren't any extras or bonus features."
4,Classic spoof on Western movies,"This classic takes the stock western situations and turns them around. The hero doesn't walk down the middle of the street for a pistol fight, he stands behind a horse and shoots the 'bad guy' with a rifle! He would have been killed doing it the 'western hero way'. It is a fun comment on western movies."
2,Not PC for current times,"My husband wanted me to watch this ""great movie"". I found too much of the material offensive and incredibly sexist. The ""funny parts"" weren't particularly amusing to this modern woman. It was definitely a product of its time and has not worn well."
4,Great Fun,"No it ain't Becket or The Unforgiven, but it's great fun and the Roger Miller renditions throughout the movie is worth the price all by itself. Would love to get the soundtrack on CD or even download it. All I can find in vinyl and ancient vinyl is very pricy."
5,good energy,This CD consistently improves my mood! I especially like the Goin'Home track. I've heard them live and it's even better...
2,Inadequate details,"This book is a reproduction of the 1907 book ""Costumes of All Nations"" (3rd edition), which in turn was reproduced from a series of plates produced by Braun and Schneider in ""Zur Geschichte der Kostume"" between 1861 and 1890. Unfortunately, in the process, all of the text (both the German and English) was removed (as was the color). So we have no way of knowing what went along with these drawings.Furthermore, there are no references of any kind, so you can't go back to the ""original"" painting, or source to verify the information. It may be helpful for getting ideas, but not for any serious costume design."
5,Considered a classic reference by historic re-creationists,"Comprhensive text on clothing, the influences and evolution of style. Covers the impacts of cultural changes and how the dictates of fashion are influenced by changes in daily life. Covers historical fads and fancies. A 'must have' basic reference for the amatuer historic costumer.This review based on the Hardcover version."
4,Great Read,"I'm not sure I understood all of the science, but the characters were great and the plot kept me riveted. A great read."
1,A Disapointment,"I know this ring is cheap, but garnets are common stones and that decreases their value. I bought this ring around Christmas and it recently snapped in two. I didn't know sterling silver could break like that. I do not reccommend this product as it is not worth anyone's money."
3,"Disappointed with the ring, but not with the company","I've had a pleasant experience with Silver Insanity and would order from them again, but the red garnet ring I ordered turned out to be an orange color. They aren't exactly accurate with their pictures, so be careful when ordering."
1,Broke way too easy,"Bought this for my daughter and it broke within months. very poor quality. It looked great when we got it and she only wore it to church and family outings, not to play sports."
2,Stone is cheap,"I loved the ring when I received it. The silver stood up to constant wearing without becoming misshapen. The problem I had was the garnet started to crack and break, and it was only from normal wear, not abuse. It looks horrible now. I was very disappointed, since I have only had this ring 4 months."
2,Broken Promise.,"This ring was lovely when I first received it, even if the ""garnet"" was orange. This ring was given to me as a promise ring and I wore it every day but I wasn't rough with it. Even though I was gentle, this ring was misshapen and needed to be replaced within two months. I wouldn't recommend wasting money if this ring will mean something to you, but for a little while it made a nice stand-in."
4,Expected.,"It is exactly what I expected, so to say, I knew it was going to be small and flimsy. This is not an expensive ring in any way(the price could have told you that) but it is pretty. I can't wear it in the shower and I worry when I wash my hands. I can bend it easily and scratch it too."
2,Not Worth It,"The ring is not very durable. The ""sterling silver"" is VERY malleable. Which leads me to believe it's not actual silver, but silver plated instead. The ring is pretty and I bought it to match my sister's red garnet celtic cross necklace for her birthday, but the ring did not last more than a month."
3,garnet stone,i liked the ring however i was very disappointed that the garnet stone was more orange than the dark red of the true garnet i was hopeing for. this was a very special ring for my daughter whose boyfriend was named Redd and his favorite color was red and his birth stone was garnet. i ordered this ring for her in remembrence ofRedd as he was murdered only days before. so this was a very special ring to us. we were hoping for a more blood red color of a true garnet.
3,Garnet?,"When I received this ring, I was very happy with the design, and the look of the sterling silver. Unfortunately I did not receive a nice garnet in the setting. It is not even RED! I received an orange garnet, which quite upset me because my other ring I wear is a deep red garnet."
5,Love it: makes me laugh every single day!,"I've been subscribed to the Daily Dilbert for quite a while now, and when I get that strip in my Inbox every morning, it's just a way to relax and laugh at some of the sad realities of work life... and other times, just a sheer innocent laugh, courtesy of Scott Adams' genius. In any case, for a fan of Dilbert, this is an ideal buy, since -after all- you need a desk calendar regardless: why not make your calendar feature your favorite comic strip! This year's (2003) calendar features strips from 1999 and 2000, so it won't be an overlap with your Daily Dilbert, and even if you've read them before, you should get a kick out of those jokes you laughed hard at when you were at that job back four years ago. Enjoy and make 2003 the best year in a long time!"
4,Bad bosses & cubicle nightmares,"I work at an engineering company so this Dilbert calendar was a perfect fit. Actually, this calendar is perfect for any office worker. There were so many times when I laughed so hard because so many of the cartoon situations happened here. A Dilbert calendar belongs in every office."
3,Kitty Surpise,"I was happy with our purchase except for the fact that the kitty had 3 babies, 2 kittens and a squirrel in its tummy. My daughter loves it so much though I cannot exchange it. I just wish it was packaged correctly with three kittens."
3,"Trico, makes great colors","I bought these as stocking stuffers for my son,He loved the colors and chose Red, to match his car. Unfortunetly, the driver side one,did not ship as Red, and He is returning them. Great idea. Cheaper that local retail auto store. Keep it up with great products."
3,We Need A Little Christmas!,"This is not as good as Andy Williams classic Christmas albums but it's still pretty good and I think his voice sounded fine but I think that the poppish style in which the musical instruments were played did not blend well with his voice, so I think the fault is not with his singing but with the musical arrangement itself! I really like the song We Need A Little Christmas, it is one of my favorite Christmas songs and my favorite song on the album."
1,still haven't received this order,This is very dishearting I ordered this cd in the beginning of december and have not gotten it and they did put iy on my charge
1,Not the best!,"I grew up with Andy Williams on the TV, Radio and Record Albums. As much as I love his music and one of a kind vocal talents, this CD falls way below my expectations. For those of you looking for the youthfull and energetic voice of Andy, you won't find it here. This voice on this CD is shaky and old. I still love Andy. However, he needs to call it quits!"
5,Music for everyone,"Tyrone Wells has played at my school a few times, and each time he performs, both guys and girls alike are excited to see him. His tunes are reminiscent of Jack Johnson or John Mayer, with smooth vocals and easy-going guitar in the background. ""Sea Breeze"" is a definite favorite."
1,thinks for the dead batterys,thinks for the dead batterys this is what is wrong with america to day no pride and it kills me to give it one star but i had to junk
3,Good vaue.,I have not used them yet so I do not know how well they will compare with other brands I have used in the past.
5,Good batteries,"At first I was skeptical, given the low price for these batteries. However, they work fine and gave my small LED flashlight some more life!"
5,batteries work,"Not sure what to fill in here, the cells work as expected. No complaints whatsoever. They power my streamlight nano successfully."
1,Dead batteries,10 batteries deader than the ones they were to replace. I wasn't expecting much for the price and it met my expectations.
2,Unsatisfied Customer,"I bought my 10 pack back in August, but I'm just beginning to use the batteries. I put three in my laser pointer and it did work. I tested the batteries (volt meter) and two of them read 0.666 volts or lower. I've tested 5 of the 10 batteries, with 2 not being any good."
1,Dead,I left the batteries in a closet unopened for a month . When I did open the package and tried to use them they were all dead.
1,the batteries are out of power too soon,6 out 10 batteries in the pack were used and all of them started to show weak power in just a few minutes. They are only to be used to power up some LEDs which don't consume much power. The previous batteries lasted for years. But these 6 batteries were completely out in less than a week under the same usage pattern. It was a very cheap buy but still it was a waste. It could be that they are long expired.
5,They work great!,They work very well and at a great price! Item was as described and shipped quickly in the packaging seen in picture.
3,Mediocre life from undated pack,"I use these batteries in small digital timers I keep in various environments, from a truck exposed to temperature extremes to an office environment with controlled temperatures to a sports bag prone to humidity. I know these timers and I honestly expected better life from a pack of batteries with the Maxell brand name. I see no made-on or use-by dates on the packaging, so perhaps I received an old pack? Regardless: at this point I expect to use up this battery pack well ahead of what I anticipated. Expect me to look for another brand when this pack runs out."
3,On Time,"__These Maxell batteries arrived in 5-7 days, in good condition. I bought these watch batteries for a Streamlight Nano light. I have no idea how long any of these button cells will last. But this is the correct model and great price for the miniature light."
3,Took a long time to get here,This product should have gotten to me within a week but it took almost 2 weeks to get here. .
5,Very Good Buy,The batteries arrived quickly after ordering them and are a very good value for the money and of good quality
5,So many batteries for so little money!,I am so happy with my purchase! I cant believe that I was able to buy 10 name brand watch batteries for such a low price!
4,As Described,"Received merchandise promptly and price was ok. Did not realize that they were alkaline, not Hg batteries, which would have lasted longer. Might have bought differently had I known. They'll just run out more quickly on my Laser boresighter."
3,Maxell LR41 Batteries,"Received in a few days and are used for my Nano flashlight. However, they were at 60% power when I compared them to a new Nano Flashlight. The company, My Battery Supplier resent another package in good faith and received today. Which is the reason for three vs. one star. Haven't tested yet because I already purchased Energizer's SR41 batteries which are a much better product."
2,Came postage due,"The product itself was satisfasctory, but it came USPS with $.40 due postage. The batteries only cost $1.49, but they already charged $4.79 for shipping & handling. It really ticked me off that it should come with postage due. Don't they KNOW what postage is required to reach any destination. All S&H charges are a big rip-off anyway ......."
1,Old Batteries,"Assume batteries were old, device indicates low battery after multiple batteries installed. I've had similar problems with batteries purchased from Amazon."
3,"Had a problem, seller sent new ones.","Supposedly 1.5 volt batteries arrived with charges between 0.8 and 1.0 volts. Worthless. Contacted seller (National Deals), no response. For two bucks, I won't pursue it any further, but figured shoppers should know.It's March 30, and I still haven't heard from National Deals.UPDATE: Contacted seller again and they responded. Sent fresh batteries that tested and worked properly."
1,JUNK,Tried batteries in the little clock I bought them for. Clock did not run. Took batteries to Radio Shack to check and confirm my check that they are very weak. They are very weak as per R/S. They are junk.
4,Delivered Quickly,Great service on a hard to find (and otherwise expensive) product ... good experience ... recommended
2,Seemed like a great deal....,Batteries die quickly. Bought them to replace a keychain flashlight battery set. The originals that came with the light lasted about a year. These ones lasted about a month. Went through all 10 in quickly.
1,Weak Batteries,"I purchased these batteries for a laser pointer. Each time I start to use the pointer it is a very bright light. In a matter of minutes the light starts to get dim. It doesn't go out completely, but it is much dimmer. Since I know the laser pointer is good, I have to conclude that the batteries are not top quality."
5,As advertised,"Not much to say -- if you want a 10-pack of LR41 button cell batteries, these do the trick. They are ""new"" and arrived quickly."
4,Have you priced batteries at the store?,"It's simple, needed these for penlight J keep in the car. At the store 2 cells cost more than the light, vs 10 for about the same money. Shipping and packaging were fine."
4,Great price,"Great price, no extra for S/H. Came in the mail in an ordinary envelope, which is just fine. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 b/cI don't know yet how fresh these are since there is no date on the package and I haven't used them long enough to know how long their life is."
4,"Hey, it's just a battery","What can you say about a card of batteries? The price was substantially lower than buying them locally, they arrived promptly and they weren't dead. I would have preferred to have been able to order a different quantity, however. They were sold as a package of ten, the only device I have that uses this size requires four, so even if the remainder of the order is still good when I need to replace the batteries next (not likely as the original set lasted about 6 years), I'll still have two left over that I'll probably never use."
5,Best Price!,"This is my 2nd time purchasing this exact item. Quick arrival, exactly as described. A fraction of the price you would pay in a retail store! You get 10 batteries on this site for the cost of 1 battery at one store I priced. Can't beat this deal."
5,Great deal!,Great deal on these batteries! Normally 3-5$ per single battery in stores. I got 30 batteries for under 9$ including shipping! Would certainly purchase again in future!
4,very good batteries,"These batteries are very durable, organized for a long life span, and fit perfectly. They last a long time in our lasers and watches."
5,Maxell LR41 Battery Pack,"The battery pack is exactly what I wanted. Batteries were not used in a watch. Rather, small penlight (flashlight) and Christmas ornaments. I will purchase more at a later date. These batteries were received rather quickly through the USPS."
3,Watch Batteries,"This is a utility item, a set of watch batteries that can be very expensive OTC. They were new, brand name and a good value. I've bought them before from Amazon with the same result."
4,Good Value - Recommended,"These Maxell LR41/AG3 Button Batteries work as expected and are a great value for 10 batteries. They worked fine in my laser pointer and seemed to be fresh, but they do not have an ""Expiration Date"" printed on them.Overall, I am very pleased with these.Recommended!CFH"
5,Can't beat the price,"Everything arrived on schedule and just as advertized. Haven't tried any of the batteries yet since there has been no need. I'll change this post if they end up being dead on arrival :-) but presuming they're live, I recommend this buy - the price is >= 10x higher in the box stores, even Walmart and Kmart and Radio Shack, provided you can even find these batteries there."
3,Good purchase,"They serve the purpose, good price and great quantity. Got exactly what I needed. Good item for the price I paid for them."
5,It works!,"Bought it for my nano keychain flashlight, and it works! It came in an envelope, they shipped quickly and it arrived in a very timely manner. no complaints. Since it comes in a pack of ten, I hopefully don't have to buy another for a while."
5,Outstanding book on the Vietnam Air War!,"This book is out print, but worth hunting down in the used book stores. Second book in a series of three. I recommend reading Termite Hill first. All three books in series are hard to put down. Tom Wilson makes you feel like you are a part of squadron."
4,my favorite butterfly,"tebaldi's butterfly was the first one I heard and it moved me so much it is still my favorite, though I also love the ones by de los angeles and callas. The highlights for when I don't have time for the complete opera."
5,"Anyone seeking God, take heed...","Robert Allan's well researched and scripturally based perspective of God's intention for believers, and those who would believe, is exactly what's needed in these days. Like me, you'll find yourself laughing uproarously one moment, then brought to tears, as God uses the author to touch you in the deepest reaches of your spirit. You can't read this book without realizing how significant you, and the Church, are to a lost world and the onus we have in it. A powerful must read!"
1,did not receive item,i did not receive this item. it was sent to the wrong address. i attempted to contact amazon but with no results. i will dispute this item when i receive my credit card bill.
3,Not as warm as I hoped.,The gloves work OK. More made for shoveling of something where your hands are moving a lot otherwise your hands get cold pretty quick. Not good for snowmobiling unless its above 25 degrees. More of a medium duty glove at best.
3,"Decent Gloves, But not warm enough","I drive a scooter during Philadelphia winters, which are chilly, but not really that bad. I bought these snowmobile gloves because I figured they would be better suited to riding in this weather, considering they would be designed to keep wind and wet out while you are doing limited physical activity. The mediums, which I usually wear, run a little small but still are doable.The biggest problem I have is that in any weather below 35 degrees F or so my fingers will still get cold and numb if I'm out for more than 15 minutes. That is barely passable for driving a scooter in the winter, and I would imagine completely un-usable if you wanted to actually snowmobile with them."
3,Good buy for the money,A decent pair of warm gloves. Fit well. Very warm. The only issue I may have is they are slick. Holding on to snowmobile grips is tough. It seems to take more effort to grip than needed. Tires out the hands.
5,Great gloves- great service!,"Super high quality, made in America gloves. I ordered them on a weekend- and they were at my door 3 days later in Alaska. Great features to keep the wind out while sleding; deer-skin palms and fingers. Great looking (Ski-Doo colors) highly recommended"
2,measurements were not accurate,"I tried to do the simplest blue bird house and some of the measurements were not mentioned, and some of the measurements were wrong. I was very dissatisfied."
2,Not for the inexperienced woodworker,"This book has some nice patterns, however, the instructions are incomplete. Whenever a joint is not 90 degrees, or some shaping is required, the angles for mitering are incorrect, or just missing. You need to do some figuring and even experimenting to get them right, resulting in what can be a major waste of time and materials, or just accepting that the outcome will not be satisfactory."
2,Birdhouse builing book,"These birdhouses are very simple designs, probably meant for kids to build. It is definitley not what I was expecting. Disappointing!"
3,Some good models... well explained,some models very decorative/old american style and not practical/good for real birds... but a nice book with some good ideas.
3,Discrepancy,The languages described on the page are very different from the languages listed in technical details. Which are correct?
1,Gift Certificate Policy N'G.,"I wanted to redeem my gift certificate to purchase this item, but I cant.......Your policy for redeeming gift certificatesis seriously wanting. I mean, it was nice that I got the certificate, but in my case I am unable to redeem it for theproducts that I want......Unless I use a credit Card,..Whats the point of the gift certificate? If I cant use it for EVERYTHING YOU offer for sale. Everything I'm interested in requires a Credit Card. I now am forced to buy things just to redeem the certificate, and quickly I might add, before it expires.You should think to change your policy regarding the Gift certificates.Thank You.Frank Valencia"
3,"Good Performance, Wierd Remastering","If Decca had just done a good, normal stereo remastering of this late 60's recording of 'Don Giovanni' highlights, with Sutherland et. al., this budget disc would have been both a winner and a bargain. However, it has become an 'Eloquence' release, with strange ambient surround coding to create a wierd overlay of resonance which has the odd effect of also magnifying random noises in the original recording when listened to closely. Basically, if you're listening to this on a boombox, it sounds like an adequate budget recording. On headphones, or good equipment, forget it."
2,Yalom's diluted existentialism,"Yalom is a fine writer, but his encounter with existentialism is piecemeal and often un-understanding. He seems to think that just dealing with certain *themes*- death, meaninglessness, etc. makes him existential. It doesn't. Existentialism is not just a school of thought that looks at these things, but it also includes a very special *way* of looking at them called *phenomenology.* Phenomenology is a research method and way of understanding human beings that is indispensible for true existential thought. It is phenomenology that makes existential psychology *better* at understanding human beings than other psychologies, and without phenomenology, ""existential psychology"" is nothing more than, as Yalom himself suggests, a psychodynamic theory with a different clinical focus. This is pretty watered-down stuff, and readers would be better off reading true existential psychologists like Medard Boss, and, more recently, Louis Sass."
2,George Jones Collection,Just a poor collection. Bought after hearing Country Music award program...piece not all like the TV selection
1,Not durable,These books fall apart far too easily. They are not bound by anything. They are made of heavy coated paper. I recently saw the books on clearance at Best Buy for $1 each...which should tell us something...
1,Don't waste your money,"That's a lot of money for flimsy books. They do fall apart easily. By the time you get them, the active pad itself will have worn out. The magnetic pen wears out after a year. My kids also lost interest in it fairly quickly."
2,Don't Expect a Detailed Explanation of MPEG2 Video,"This book didn't live up to previous reviews. It's quite expensive at $95. The chapters compartmentalize subjects such as motion compensation modes and video coding which are not independent subjects, and they never tie these subjects together. I haven't found a block diagram of a video encoder anywhere in the book. The entire subject of MPEG2 video encoding is covered in one 25-page chapter (although there is a chapter on motion compensation as I mentioned, and there's a chapter on Video Stream Syntax and Semantics which is little more than a re-hash of the MPEG2 part 2 spec.). I've gotta believe there's something better out there. The ""Techniques and Standards for Image Video and Audio Coding"" by Rao/Hwang is a bit better."
1,wasting time book,"If you really want to learn MPEG2 or MPEG4, go directly to the standards. The authors try their best to confuse the reader. Even simple concepts cannot be explained clearly."
1,wasting time books,"With many years of MPEG experience, I still found the book boring. Simple concepts become chaos from author's poor sentences. Almost all graphs are used for confusing the reader. I could hardly finish reading. Frankly, all video gurus in our company dislike the book. If you really want to learn MPEG-2 or MPEG-4, go directly to the standards. They are more clearly written."
2,Does what is does,It holds coins. It you have it in the car the semi loose coins rattle. The lids are not the most tight fitting.
5,Using as the basis for team development,"With Great content and simple tools, this is a fantastic resource offered by ASTD authors. I plan to use it when creating a development plan for tenured facilitators."
5,A book for the golfer that wants to get better.,This is one of the best golf psychology books I have ever read. If you want to improve your game you will read this book.
3,Do-it-yourself hypnosis,"This is a good book to teach you self-hypnosis.At first the author shows you how to be confident and how to focus on your golf game. I like the mental putting tip in this book.Then the author introduces you to a few samples of self-hypnosis scripts. You can make your own audio tape by yourself. Some ready-made tapes are available from the author, too."
2,Chainz 2,I thought this game would be fun after playing it on line. I guess I'm not good at this type of game as I can't figure out the stategy to get past the lower levels. Being stuck is never fun.
2,Indefinite Fatal Errors!,"I do enjoy playing the classic and strategy levels but just as I'm getting somewhere with the strategy level, it keeps getting ""fatal errors"" and then I have the option of reporting it, which I don't see what good that does, and then it closes the game. It's very annoying. I can't get anywhere with it. Definitely has programming issues. They should sent everyone a replacement CD with a GOOD version!"
4,Chanz 2,"I am still trying to beat this game. The first 6 or 7 levels are not hard, but I have been on level 9 forever! I can't even imagine what level 10 will be like if and when I ever get there."
1,I have never got to use it.,"I wish I would have never brought this product. I installed it on my computer and it asked me to get a download off another web site to make sure that the product was up to date. Anyhow, my comouter didn't download it so another option was send an email to the company and they would send me the download I needed to use the software. I E-mailed them Jan 7, 2007 and I have not recieved any information since. I'm very, very, unhappy."
2,Boss of Bosses...inaccurate,"Very inaccurate story, ""Gotti"" the movie is way better and more accurate. Chaz Palminteri was good, almost too good to be Paul Castellano. I was disappointed about the use of old film from the 30's to represent the past. It had Carlo Gambino working for Vito Genevese, which is totally untrue! Plus Gotti's character was wac. Its an ok movie if ur that bored, but I should've known better than to buy it...I know one thing, I'll never trust u people and ur reviews again cause ur all crazy!!"
1,AWFUL,"This is a made for TV movie. Do not expect accuracy or good acting, aside from Chaz in the lead role. The movie focuses a lot on the romance with his housekeeper...in addition to being inaccurate (noteably the details surrounding his assassination) it also jumps around too much and ends up covering virtually no details in process."
4,"""Boss Of Bosses"" Review","This was one of my favorite mafia films. I do agree though, Gotti should have had a bigger part in it. I also agree the looks were horrible. Gotti, Castellano, and Gambino didn't look nothing like themselves! The acting was right on, and the story line was very intresting. I'd recommend atleast renting it."
3,castellanos life,slow moving and chazz is the wrong actor to play this part. some events are not true or mixed up. still a recommended buy for the hard core mob collector.
2,THIS GUY LOOKS NOTHING LIKE BIG PAUL,"This guy looked nothing like Paul Castellano, but then again it would be really hard to find someone like him. That being said i did not like this movie it was not like the true story it was boring, i recommend you guys watch ""Gotti"" that film was much better, this one was a TV movie. Not so good, what really made me hate this movie was the assassination, they did not show when Gotti was communicating with the hitmen threw walkie talkies, it only showed when he saw the hit, plus the hit was just wrong! the gunman walked slowly and shoot him and nobody was around it looked like it was like @ 3 in the mourning. You want the real story, watch Mobsters, it tells you everything with details. That's why i didn't like this film. peace the f**k out."
4,Not to be missed.,"This movie is based on a true story of Paul Castellano, who ruled the Manhattan in 1970s with construction unions and real estates funded by the money he earned from the illegal activities of the Gambino crime family. After becoming the head of the crime family, his resistance to involve in drugs and crimes made many people down the chain unhappy. John Gotti was one of them, who later assassinate Castellano and rose to power.The movie is considered dull and slow, but I don't agree. If you are looking for some ""Steven Seagal"" kind of action, then just forget it. If you have liked Godfather, Scarface, and Gotti, then you definitely won't mind adding this to your collection too. Chazz Palminteri, just played the role of head of crime family brilliantly. His dialogue delivery is perfect for this kind of movie and role. The movie is real and has some powerful moments. Not to be missed."
2,"A movie on Castellano, how boring.","I love Chazz P. and I can see why he would want to give the other side of the Castellano epic, but man is this movie boring. Castellano has to be one of the most uninvolved mobsters ever to take the reins of a crime family. If you know the history of this guy, than you should agree, and if you don't, read some books about him. As powerful as he was, he sure didn't know much about running a crime family as did his predecessors, which this film doesn't portray. The film also has terrible actors portraying both Sammy the Bull and John Gotti. An insult at that. If you like mafia movies and don't care about the history of its real-life characters than by all means watch it. If you do, skip it, you'd be better off reading a book."
4,"TRUE, ALL TRUE","THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON THE TRUE STORY OF THE GAMBINO FAMILY. ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUSE MAFIA FAMILIES OF ALL TIME. JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THE MOVIE IS TRUE, IT REALY HAPPEND. HOW PAUL CASTILLANO BECAME HEAD BOSS, AND HOW JOHN GOTTI SHOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED BUT GOT A FREE PASS TO LIVE. THEY EVEN TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE DONNIE BRASCO THING. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE TRUTH THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU. CHAZZ PLAYS PAUL CASTILLANO, HE DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB."
4,Based on a True story you can not go wrong,This is in my top 10 best mob movies the acting was great. And the best part is that Chazz Palminteri look pretty much like. Paul Castellano in this movie this movie is also based on a true story which makes it even more great to watch.
4,A refreshing perspective...,"Anyone who has seen ""Gotti"" should also see ""Boss of Bosses"" (or read the novels). The movie is well done, considering its era of production, budget, etc. Paul Castellano, as well as most of the other characters, are quite believable and the movie serves well as entertainment or Mafia education material. In many ways, Castellano was the *last true don* of the Gambino Family."
2,Luciano Pavarotti - Nessun dorma (Arias & Duets),"While the music selections were excellent & enjoyable to listen to, I was disappointed in the overall quality of the sound of the CD..it just didn't have the richness of sound I am used to in classical music recordings."
4,Essential Pavarotti,PavarottiLuciano Pavarotti - Nessun dorma (Arias & Duets)at his finest. Wonderful recording to listen to when you can't hear the entire opera.
3,Three stars in spite of this edition.,"This is actually a pretty good movie for it's time. Influential on later American action films to be sure (the American film industry of the 80's pillaged older better Itallian films). The main problems here are a very poorly done transfer and even worse, an edited American print. While I've not had the pleasure of seeing the original cut, it had something like another 15 minutes of film! Lee Van Cleef is a real pleasure, as is Edwige Fenech (what little she's in this), and a descent supporting cast. Interesting idea, with some good action sequences (well filmed and executed car chase). I would no doubt give this a higher rating in its original form."
2,It is not that bad,I dont no why people think that this video needs to really be rated. This is what kids like these days
3,Speaker Quality,"The product is nice, but the speaker quality is not that great. When i turn the volume up the speaker doesnt sound too good. For best use, lay down on the pillow or with it and keep the volume low. I was under the assumption that it would be a little louder (hoping to replace some computer speakers)."
3,Shekinah Glory Ministry: Jesus,"It is just like the CD except there is dancing. I didnt say I didnt like it, its just plain to me. No excitement for me."
5,"AWESOME!! Holy name of ""JESUS""","When i first heard the song ""JESUS"" by this groug i was amazed at how poweful that song is. I had to have the DVD when i saw it on Amazon. This group will inspire you and lift you up in the name of Jesus. If you miss church service on Sunday put in this DVD and it will be just like you at church or giving your praise to the almighty name of GOD!! It don't have to be on Sunday, any day is a good day to enjoy this DVD. I am very pleased with my purchase. I put this DVD in my player any day and listen to it. The song ""JESUS"" is almost the last performance and it is so awesome the way she sings and perform this masterpiece. I skip it back two or three times everytime i watch it. I din't want no bootyleg copy either, I wanted a bought out the store of online legally purchased DVD. This group deserve to be recognized in dvd sales for such a awesome job for our Lord and Saviour. Also fast service on the order. I had my copy in about 3 days."
1,Horrendous,"This album is dreadful. The first song is a compilation, shudder. Then there's a series of dance numbers, but they are not really Latin music but ""dance party"". I guess if you're looking for that it'd be OK, but I wasn't. The beat is monotonous, the singing ordinary, the flavour bland."
4,Recommendable,"The title of the book is misleading. This is a book about people, people you would have liked to have as your friends. You don't have to be a Jew to read this book. You can be an atheist, a Hindu, a Muslim or a Christian (like me) to appreciate it. This is an amazing book, and highly recommendable."
5,jersey rocks!!!,Its deserves 5 stars cause i love jersey shore and i got what i bought --- awesomesness :) plan to buy the other 2 seasons i dont have yet in due time
4,Satisfactory!,"I ordered this in order to see extended scenes of the second fight between Jwoww and Sammi, however none were provided. I don't regret buying though."
1,P.T. Barnam Was Right!!,"Barnam was correct: No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public. I was amused by one thing about this whole series. With a housefull of Italian kids over season upon season, you'd think ONE would go to Sunday Mass."
1,this show makes america look bad,i do not care about how people praise this show in my honest true opinon this show makes me sick and makes america look bad why watch a show that has no intelligence in it all this show is argueing fightning crying and drama in my opinon this and the people on this show in my opinon are not entertaing or good role models the guys and girls on this show make complete fools of themselfs this show should be taken off tv for good thats how terrible it is
1,this show just stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this dvd is just oe big epic fail and yes it is a waste of time and money buy something else instead this dvd is not the worth the time or money it is just a very boring dvd of a very lame mtv reality show
5,Western medicine can't heal everything,"When you are faced with a major illness, allopathic (western) medicine can not always help you. When our 13-year-old son was diagnosed with bone cancer, we were overwhelmed. We looked into several alternative healing options before deciding on a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, plus several alternative (complementary) methods. This book offers an excellent overview of dozens of viable (and successful) alternatives to the sometimes toxic side-effects promoted by western medicine. It may be that what you need is a combination of the best of both; if so, this book can lead you toward finding adjunct healing methods which can make the difference between comfort and pain, and sometimes success in healing. Had we followed western therapies alone, our son would have lost his leg--that's what the hospital doctors recommended. Instead, we used some modalities that allowed us to save his leg."
1,One of dozens of exploitative quackery-promoting tomes.,"Do we really need still more deceptive propaganda promoting chiropractic for systemic ailments, shark cartilege for cancer, homeopathy for everything and the whole grab bag of alternatoid medicine rot? The authors have no credentials in any health-related fields and they are obviously not capable of evaluating scientific literature, if they bothered to read any. They supply no references to support their preposterous conclusions. This book is rubbish and it is very disappointing to see it as a ""best book"" selection on this website."
4,Broad Scope,This book provides a good foundation coverage of the entire field of research administration.Those new to the field or old hands will find something to use in this text.
4,"A great, if hefty read","One of the best and really, one of the very few, books on research management out there. A must have for any current research administrator's collection and a great read for anyone just getting started or interested in a future in research administration."
4,Comprehensive,"The first comprehensive, authoritative text on research administration - from pre award to technology transfer. A must have for all institutions conducting research and sponsored projects."
2,"Classic original Bachrach tunes, 1960's production","Burt Bacharach's music is infused into the subconscious of everyone who listened to popular music in the 60's and 70's. This CD is a compilation of the airplay hit versions of Bacharach/David songs. They are interesting, but Burt is not playing on them (except for the last song w. Elvis Costello). The original production quality of many of these 60's cuts is pretty rough by today's standards. I was looking for more polished Bacharach-performed orchestrations... If you want to hear Burt play his songs, keep looking thru the CD bin. I did not enjoy Jerry Butler's version of ""Make It Easy on Yourself"", which I think is one of Burt's best songs ... The Naked Eyes version of ""Always Something There to Remind Me"" is a trite 80's jingle. Why is it so hard to find a CD with ""THis Guy's in Love"" on it? Jackie DeShannon does a great job with ""What the World Needs Now"" and Sergio Mendes cooks with ""Look of Love""."
3,"A fair sampling of classic Bacharach, but not the best","Contrary to the last reviewer's comments, Burt was actually in the studio when many of these cuts were recorded, and whether or not he actually sat at the piano, he shaped every aspect of the arrangements he supervised. That said, this compilation is a bit of an odd mix of classic ""original"" versions and later versions. The Rhino Records box set has the best versions of most of these songs, and would be a much better choice if you can afford to spring for 3 CDs.As to Burt's own slick orchestral intrumental versions of his hits, I find the mid-fi 1960s radio versions infinitely more charming. Burt's reputation as the elevator music king was certainly reinforced by those mediocre solo albums he released in the 60s and 70s."
4,Takes you back to the 60's,"With the exception of 2-3 songs I could listen to this CD over and over again. My favorites are Aretha Franklin's ""Say A Little Prayer,"" anything by Dusty Springfield , Jackie DeShannon, Perry Como's ""Magic Moments"". I didn't care for Naked Eyes or Tom Jones. It's good easy listening with a sprinkling of soul and pop."
4,impressive cross section,"As this disc shows, Burt Bachrach has had a very long career spanning a tremendous diversity of songs. I guarantee you that unless you are a total expert you will be surprised by at least a few of the songs and find yourself saying, HE wrote that? A couple of the versions here are questionable, especially the Naked Eyes, but the vast majority of the songs are excellent and, even where the original hits are not used, the versions are quite good. An entertaining, reasonably good CD."
2,why so expensive?,Why is this book so expensive? I really don't think that anyone will pay $100 for this book. If it was less (a lot less) I might buy it to use as a source for my English Litterature paper.
2,Overpriced,"This product is very overpriced and undersized, just like all Proactiv products. They sort of work for awhile, but they aren't worth all that money. There are natural and cheaper alternatives, such as toothpaste for blemishes."
5,Good service,I bought this for my mom and see likes it but wish the tube was a little bit bigger other wise no problems.
3,Works pretty well.,"I have used this product, and the other Proactiv products quite frequently. They do seem to work pretty well, but just a little word ahead - when using the Proactiv products, you have to keep up with it. They all say use twice a day, at night before bed, and in the morning. I have noticed that if you don't keep with the routine, you will break out even more than you did before. I tend to break out a lot right around a certain time a month, and Proactiv has helped heal some of those break outs. It dries it up quickly, and they scab over a coarse of two to three days. But like I said, if you skip a day - more pimples will pop up! It's great if you can keep it up, though. The only problem I have had with it is it doesn't help clear the acne scars. I am very fair skinned, and once my pimples have healed and went away, it does leave dark spots, and I'm just finding myself putting on lots of make up to hide them. I would love something to correct those as well!"
2,does not work well,"Results take way too long, shipping was great but the product its self is not very affective... I would suggest a different brand of blemish treatment."
1,Rip off,"I ordered the initial kit from proactiv and not only did it make my skin worse, THEY RIPPED ME OFF!!! It is almost impossible to cancel (have to call in and wait on hold forever) and even after I did they sent me another kit, or at least so they say. I moved from the address, which is one of many reasons I canceled my ""subscription"" and yet I received a letter from a shady collection agency (SKO Brenner American) saying I owe $67.89...... Tried calling proactiv and of course they could not help. Do yourself a favor and save your time, money, and skin. STAY AWAY from proactiv!!"
3,Pretty good product,"This blemish cream isn't the magic zit zapper that I thought it would be, but it does certainly work over time. Your pimples are not going to disappear overnight as advertised, but I thought it did do wonders over a week or so. It really does help dry up zits quickly. It works really fast if you apply it to the area where you feel a pimple coming. I do recommend this product, if you can afford the astronomical price."
4,This product is good,"Nothing for me really lreally really works. This is as good as any, and makes my face feel cleean. It is a little drying."
4,Proactiv Blemish Treatment,"This product works, just not as fast as I had hoped. It contains ""Benzoyl Peroxide"" which is what all skin outbreak over the counter treatments contained 30 years ago. The only differences are; this product seems to have a stronger percent of Benzoyl Peroxide, but charges hugely for what used to cost barely nothing. I am glad to be using it though."
2,There are other products that have the same ingredients for much less.,"Stick a Proactive label on a product and charge three times as much! The active ingredient in this product is Benzoyl peroxide and many other products including ""Pernex AC"" and ""Panoxyl"" all contain Benzoyl peroxide and are just as effective at 1/3rd the price. I found this out only after receiving the product and reading the label, I then carried it to a pharmacist who gave me the bad news that I had wasted my money."
4,great product,Great product that works. I have noticed the difference within 3 days after using it. Its a bit price though.
1,Not happy!!,"This product is not good for acne, as I have not seen results as promised!! I would not recommend this product, not worth the price!! You can buy clearasil and thats cheaper and it works!! I thought this product would work better, but I was totally wrong!! :(So, I switched back to my original clearasil!!"
2,Didn't seem to help,"I bought this thinking it would help like the rest of the Proactiv Products do. I work in a mill and I am very dirty by the time I get home. This product didn't help one bit. Maybe it would for someone who doesn't work where they are always covered in grime, but it didn't stand up to what I needed it to."
1,Don't Get Hooked Up With Proactiv,"I purchased the $29.95 trial pack from Proactive for my teen-aged son. Not only did it not work well, it took me nearly three months and dozens of phone calls to cancel my ""introductory"" offer. I finally had to lock them out of my PayPal account to keep them from taking more more money. I ended up paying $119.90 for two boxes of their product that does not work. I finally was able to cancel the account, but ended up paying over twice as much as they advertise for half the product. They are unethical and make it nearly impossible to cancel once they have your info. Avoid Proactiv as it doesn't work and they are crooks."
1,"Doesnt work, makes problems worse","I dont know if Im allergic to this stuff, but it does not work at all. It bleaches the skin, your clothes, etc. and makes your blemishes more red and more permanent. This is full of chemicals and it cannot be good for my skin!"
3,Decent product,This blemish treatment product works alright. It helps dry out a pimple but it doesn't work for every pimple. The price is a bit high considering how little product you get. I'm glad I tried it but I probably wouldn't get it again.
3,Proactiv,"This product will not make blemishes disappear, but it does help control and prevent them. I've been using the product for well over a year and plan to continue. That's an endorsement."
1,Seriously?!?,Seriously? How do you send me a tube that is completely broken with cream oozing out of it. It wasn't a shipping mistake because the tube was inside of two different boxes. The back end of the tube's seal was completely broken and the cream was almost completely all out. The mask has some kind of greasy oil all over it and I just can't believe the quality you would send a customer. Do you not even have a customer quality assurance team? Obviously not!
5,Great rare item in mint condition,This was just what I was looking for. This cd is very hard to find and gives some Ray Charls flavor to Christmas music.Bought for his version of Winter Wnderland but I enjoyed all the songs.
4,"We both like it, and one of us hates Christmas music.",Since it arrived after Christmas (I ordered it late) I only played it once. By next Christmas I will probably love it.
5,A great mix of Jazz and Ray Charles' style for the season,Some of the classic Christmas songs put to an upbeat Jazzy mix that only Ray Charles can do. This album is a little known secret that will be a great addition to your Christmas CD collection!
2,the Spirit of Christmas,Somewhat disappointing for my taste. A real die hard Ray Charles fan would probally enjoy.
2,Neither the best of Ray Charles nor the best of Christmas,This album is very dissapointing. It is neither the best of Ray Charles nor the best of Christmas. There isn't much of the heart that he is noted for. His words are badly slurred. This is definitely not his best work.
1,What a disappointment!,"The quality of the recording on this cd was absolutely terrible! It sounded 'tinny' and 'scratchy'. I love Ray Charles, but unless I just happened to get a bad copy, don't waste your money."
5,"Rugged, Dependable Mini-Mouse","I have had this mouse for over 3 years, and its been reliable despite the beating it has taken. I use it almost every day when I caryy my laptop to meetings. The retract mechanism works very well, is very smooth, the buttons are crisp and have worked flawlessly, It's very small but also ergonomic. It works far better than my wireless mouse and far more convenient than a full size mouse (and cable) or PC touch pad. You will be very glad you have this mouse. After a 3 year beating, the cable where it attaches to the mouse end has become intermittent- likely the wires have broken inside due to the abuse it has taken. I'm ordering a replacement today."
1,Not worth the money.,"Very disappointed in the functionality of this devise. I didn't have high expectations, but the buttons should be set to click properly. I have used this item, same brand and style before and was very happy. So I imagine this speaks to lack of quality control. I would avoid, simply because you can't be certain you won't get the same problem."
3,Dosn't last,Item came proptly as ordered and worked fine for a few weeks. I'm use to my retractable mice dying after a realtively short life but this seemed a little fast.
5,a million times better than the movie,"The only thing this book has in common with the bad Sally Fields movie is the title and the general topic: people who own horses. This is a witty, beautifully written book with memorable, likeable characters. It has a true romance (June/November, approximately) at its center. It has a quirky, funny narrator (Murphy), too."
2,Form and Style 5 - Personality 0,"To put my comments in perspective, I have to admit that I loved the movie with James Garner and Sally Fields...I expected that there would be something in the book that would ring true with the movie but I was quite mistaken.Putting that aspect of the story aside, I found none of the characters in this novella to be engaging other than wondering just how annoying, petty and pathetic they could possibly be.On the other hand, I found the writing itself to be quite well done. The author's grasp of dialogue was exceptional. He infused every conversation with the fullness of characterization. If only these people had something important to say or had designs that were something beyond their own selfish needs."
5,Good value for under ten bucks.,"I received this brush within 36 hours of having bought it, which is an impressive feat in and of itself. The brush is sturdy, a good size for a sedan, and has a nice, wide scraper. Now it's easier than ever for me to rid my windshield of ice and snow in the mornings. Definitely worth the eight bucks."
5,Pretty good.,"Seems a bit better than the ones other family members have bought at local stores. Might be a bit short for truck windshields, but fine for mid-sized and small cars."
2,Eh,I'm disappointed with this scraper. The edge is uneven so you only scrape a slim path with each stroke. It's no better than a cheap one you could buy at a gas station.
2,Unremarkable,"My husband bought two for Christmas presents. After using one on a heavily-frosted windshield, he found that this item worked no better nor worse than what is available in stores. He relied on the ad in Popular Mechanics to promote a unique product or one which would surpass the average plastic tool found any where. The dip in the handle allows you to get a good grip and to use extra force, but the blade is a narrow strip of plastic which did not clear evenly. Save your money/postage and give this one a pass.."
3,Great Product,"This product is very strong and sturdy for the amount of money i paid for it. It was worth the money :) Mine actually came yellow in color rather than blue, I personally don't care what color it is but I feel that is some false advertising."
5,Ice & Snow Scraper,Very Hevy Duty Ice @ Snow Scraper ! Wroks Great. a Quality product that comes in handy on those Frozen Mornings.Handy Brush sweeps it away after chipping it off a thick well flited handle for a secure gloved grip and the long shaft makes it easy to reach over a truck's windshield . Works Great for Me.
3,Bought for beautiful curve,"I saw & bought this item in a store because I found it well made & possessing a beautiful curve.The scraper clears its full width (depending on the type of snow/ice), however my single-handed efforts using the brush are wimpy.I had never had a brush scraper combo before...using this one, I think I would prefer more separation between scraper & brush. The corners of the scraper are quite sharp & I unintentionally made cuts while using the brush part.Mine is all Black."
2,Scraper Broke and No Replacement,Ok so at first I thought this thing was great but then we had a little ice here in Ky. As soon as I tried to use this thing on ice it broke. Don't get me wrong plastic breaks and that is OK I guess. The real problem I have with this thing is that the primary reason I bought it was that the scraper appeared to be replaceable. The only problem is that it is not replaceable and the manufacturer will not send out the replacement part either. I mean when you look at the thing it clearly looks like it is made from replaceable parts but its not. Scrapers break all the time and there is no way I would spend the money on something like this again knowing that it cannot be repaired.
5,"does the job, good value for money","What can you really write about an ice scraper? It does the job, was on sale with free shipping and my neighborhood stores had run out of it."
2,ok,"I bought this and the Mallory 532 26"" Snow Brush. The Mallory brush is far better than the Hopkins brush. Get the Mallory brush instead!!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BPLNXC/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_1"
3,Subzero Snowbrush,"I've got this brush before the last storm in New England. It is a little bit heavy and the brush is too hard. It may even cause some scratches if used incautiously. So it would be better to clean up the glassy areas of car with it specially for SUVs. Although it is blue on ad, they sent me a red brush. There wasn't any color preferences when I ordered it."
3,Cheaper at Target,"The unit came in red color, pretty similar to a unit in Target...and it's cheaper in Target."
4,"Works well enough, perhaps a bit pricey (but saved a trip to the store)",I gave this show brush 4 stars. I have used it for both snow and ice and it works well enough. It also seems fairly sturdy.The only reason I did not give it 5 starts is that I have seen similar snow brushes for less at stores. But hey - I saved a trip with my car to get one.
1,zodiac does not work!,"I bought the Zodiac flea treatment thinking it would kill the fleas, eggs, ect. on my three cats, it did nothing but make a huge oily mess on their necks and sides. It also made one of them sick throwing up all over the place. I tried using it for 2 months to give it a decent try but it did absolutly nothing but make a mess! Now I have 3 months worth of fleas to clean out with expensive advantage, instead of 1 month, which I should have done in the beginning!"
2,Something Weird ships burnt DVD-Rs,"I won't go into the movie, it's a minor exploitation classic and thats the reason why I ordered it.Why then this review? Because Something Weird Video has switched its production politics. When I ordered the title recently, I was under the impression to get a regular, factory-produced DVD. What I got is a burnt DVD-R. Obviously SWV has switched to the cheaper production-on-demand assembly-line. This should have been communicated to its customers. Also, the DVD-case is the cheapest piece of plastic trash I have ever seen - and I hve seen some. Imho this is an inexcusable deterioration of product quality, I therefore recommend to look elsewhere to get this movie before shelling out hard-earned cash for a DVD-R in a cheapo plastic case."
1,Changed my opinion,"Originally, I had very negative things to say about this product--namely problems with scanning chrome. Well, it took a couple of attempts over the past three years, but Nikon's support crew did a fantastic job once I convinced them of the problem, and they absorbed the entire cost of the repair (which was almost half the cost of the scanner).In other words, Nikon stands behind its products. And you can't beat that. Buy it."
5,Stunningly beautiful,"Quiet PathsI am extremely fortunate to have a vacation retreat on an unspoiled northwoods river in the forest of northern Wisconsin. If I could translate into music my experiences there of gorgeous, beautiful and divinely peaceful snow falls amid the timid chorus of chickadees and nuthatches, this work would be the result. Highly recommeded for evoking peaceful, almost childhood Christmas-like memories and atmosphere; the beauty and peace of nature in music."
2,Crappy,I used to have this phone and it's kind of crappy. I did not care much for the orange backlight and the black writing. I'm much more for color screens because I can see better when I am outside. It's a little chunky compared to all the other phones I have had. The reception is good for this phone. This phone was a turn off for me because of the fact it is not a flip phone. I kept pressing buttons and dialing people when I wasn't using it.
5,Fantastic,"Zamfir is really magical. My CD came on time, new with perfect sound. I recommend this particular title to all pan flute aficionados"
3,Cracked case,"The CD is new, but the case is cracked. No big deal, except thatit was meant as a gift and no one likes to give an imperfect gift!"
4,addictive,I bought this upgraded version for my husband after the first one was stolen and he spends hours playing it. Strong critical thinking and planning game for those who enjoy an intellectual challenge. Our 9 yr old son is starting to get the hang of it but doesn't have the patience for the long haul yet.
4,tropico mucho macho + free game,"been looking for tropico mucho macho for long time, this cd gave me 2 games for the price of 1, cant beat that!"
3,It works,"The unit installed OK. However, with both the drivers side and passenger side switches, ""up"" makes the window go down and ""down"" makes the window go up. The electrical connectors are keyed, so I didn't install this incorrectly. I suspect the wiring to the motor was reversed when it was assembled at the factory. Too much hassle to remove the unit and send it back."
3,David Shelby Book Much Better,"I have read both books and found that the HP Book, by David Shelby had more detailed information than this one. Shelby gives exact camshaft recomendations with different cylinder head configurations as well as an in-depth look at the ECM programming."
2,Very Dissapointing,"The information in this book is dated and contains some inaccuracies. Several of the modifications the author suggests are known in the 3rd gen community to be a waste of time and money. In my opinion, this book is not very useful, unless you are a total beginner and need a basic primer on these cars. Far better information is available on the web."
3,82-98 Camaro wide range,"The 82-92 Camaro or third gen this book will be tuff for you. Because the only engine they will tell you to go with is the 350. It tries to explain the other engines in a positive note, but its honest. So if you have a six, four cylinder or a 305 this book will seem to exclude you. Except the 3800 series 6.This book furtherd my knowledge of what to do next to my 97. Like body strengthening and transmission knowledge. So if you're building a 350TPI 86-92 or have a 93-97 camaro this is a good choice. If you have a 98 look on. This book is dated, so keep this in mind. Its a good book, but I thought how to tune a 5.0 Mustang was better put together. But this book has to deal with the fact that the Z28 is a great car to start and it only reinforces that."
3,Not Specific Enough,"Although this book does have good information on '82-92 Camaros, the performance tips are very general. It lacks in-depth specifics on parts and why some performance items work on these cars."
3,hummmm,"well while i found the acting good and the story line was pretty good. i mean it wasn't obvious of who the 5 were which made me keep my eyes glued to the tv. i found the ending lacking and left me unsatisfied. i would probably watch the movie again but i don't think i would buy it for myself, unless i got a very good deal on it."
2,Disappointing storyline wrapped in flyfishing lore,"Being relatively new to flyfishing, I was looking forward to this novel-chosen for our book group. I must admit I had high hopes, but was very disappointed in the storyline which would probably succeed better as a dramatic series on TV (read: ""Dallas"".) It could be set in Montana and have lovely scenes evoking the joys of flyfishing. A good ensemble cast could make this an interesting production. Unfortunately, on the written page, it fails for me, because even the joys of fishing are not well evoked and the plot is too predictable. Too bad. I guess I was hoping for something more like Norman Maclean or Wallace Stegner's writings. I will go back to those.If you want to read this novel, take it out of the library; you can always buy it later."
1,Slack Line Fishing Book,"Characters in this book are developed only insofar as each is the same as the other. The dialogue is forced and is too often used to advance the story, which is difficult to find amid the writing gimmicks and the characters' frequent and distracting digressions into self absorption about the most minute topics. A skilled trout fisher must often create slack in the drift in order to make the fly look natural and believable to a fish. In writing, maintaining tension is just as critical. There is no tension in this book, anywhere, especially, of all places, after Alton gets hit with the beer bottle near the end."
5,Loved it.,"Jeff Hull paints a vivid, wonderful story. This book takes you to Montana, and keeps you there well after the last chapter is read."
5,Great book - great new book writer,"Early Xmas gift that I couldn't put down.I have fished many places, including Montana. This book brought me back. Rich storyline, interesting characters and an honest portrayal of the complexities facing many of the storied fishing spots across the country. And, beautiful insights into why those of us who fish for the joy of it all are brought back to the water whenever life allows. Hull paints a picture of fishing a stream that fills all of your senses. I agree with the editorial reviewers who evoke the names of the great fishing authors when describing Hull's writing. He gets it and can put it into words that you can't stop reading. I can't wait for his next book!"
3,Great price on speaker wire...wish it wasn't hot pink,For the most part 20 gauge speaker wire is 20 gauge speaker wire. IMO it felt a little thin for 20 gauge compared to the RCA brand I installed in my other room. The picture made it out to be clear covering of the gold wire. It was hot pink. Try to hide hot pink wiring against white walls. Not sure if I was sent one of the few pink ones or the seller has pink wire of every sort. Not bad for the price though.
5,A Must Have For Collectors!,"This is a charming book chock full of information for the beginning and advanced collector alike. Each chapter tells about a different collectable, with information on how to start, where to look and what to look for. The ancedotes are absolutely charming, and make the book a very fun and interesting read above and beyond the valuable specific information. The photos are a great addition as well."
2,THE ONE SIDED VERSION,"If you are looking for a history in which Christians can do no wrong, this is the book for you. If you want a more balanced story of the times, this is not a good book."
3,Not the Original,"If you are looking for the Original (Columbia ""CS8693"") Jingle Bell Jazz (cover has Red Santa Sack full of gifts)issued October 17, 1962, THIS IS NOT IT. The reissue (""PC 36803"")of Jingle Bell Jazz (cover has Snow filled N.Y. streets with Taxi Cabs)in September, 1973 is GREAT. This latest ""reissue"" IS NOT. If you are expecting either of the ""Original"" issues on CD, you will be greatly offended. There is no Chico Hamilton, no Paul Horn. In 1985, CBS stupidly combined Jingle Bell Jazz with another Columbia recording called God Rest Ye Merry Jazzmen and the sad result is THIS CD. Do youself a favor, secure the Vinyl Original and burn your own CD. ""You'll be glad you did."" (...) I'd sell you my CD but it was so sorry, I couldn't sell it, I GAVE it away."
3,Good but exceedingly mathematical,"Obviously a work of very high quality. But the author is more preoccupied with outrageously complex mathematical models than with explaining what they are good for. A good reference if you are extremely familiar with the topics and are looking for a research-orientated, thick analytical coverage. Too far-fetched otherwise."
3,its a nice story,"The story line is nice, but the book is too long. The main character dragged on about past events which made the book kinda boring. I found myself skipping paragraphs toward to end just to get to the end."
5,Worth the price.,I enjoy techno music and creating it. This inexpensive program does that. I only wish I could change keys while creating this kind of music or maybe I can later as I learn the program better.
1,Mahjong Quest,i love tha game i play online all the time but the game i bought will not load on my computer so i cant tell you if it works or if it is great it sounds like it trying to load but never does
4,Was a little disappointed.,"The sound quality was not as good as I had hoped, I found myself having to crank the volume on my cd player, to double what I would on any other cd to even hear it. However that being said, the music itself was beautiful, even though it was quiet. I do have some favorites; ""the ancient mother"", ""may the circle be open"" and ""the circle is cast""."
3,It's Okay...,I had such high hopes for this CD and waited patiently until I had enough money to buy it. Turns out that I only like 3 songs on the entire CD. I didn't care for the christian material thrown in. I'll stick to my Lisa Thiel CDs until something better comes along.
3,Ancient mother,"Very beautiful collection of chants. His book with KB 'Discovering the Spirit in Sound', is also excellent, and recommended for the person interested in chants. He is very eclectic. Listen to some of the free sound bites first- not for everyone, his style somewhat different from some of the other chanting tapes I personally collect. ***Melissa"
3,Normally I Love Robert's Music,This album in my view did not fulfill my expectations. It lacked power that normally his music conveys. Of course this is only one album out of his many wonderful collections of music repeating its' self over and over. Which is great as one does not have to constantly rewind to hear the song it again. This album seemed to have one melody chasing the next one which did not seem all that different.
4,No problem,This CD came promptly and there was no problems with it. The packaging etc was in good shape. The tracks play with no problem.
3,Expensive,Time released and heavily recommneded by my Tree Nursery. It is much more expensive than other 13-13-13 fertiliziers.
4,Clever spin on a traditional tale,"This book started off amazing, I was instantly drawn into the story and the author's spin on the traditional King Arthur legend. It almost had a Harry Potter like feel to it where the world created was our own but with instances of unexplained magic and mysteries that somehow were believable the way the author conveyed them. As I approached the last few chapters of the book I wondered how the author would tie up all of the loose ends and get the lesson across that he was so very clearly trying to convey. I must say I was a bit disappointed with the ending. I felt the story had so much potential, but in the end it got lost in itself and wasn't as fulfilling as I had hoped. I would still recommend this book, I just feel it really had the chance to be brilliant instead of just a decent story."
5,The Magic Returns.,"Chopra manages with some Skill to interweave his teachings into this magical story. except for a few numbing points, this book is certainly a good work. With a good editing, it might even be a good theme for film purposes."
2,Merlin stay home,"I dislike giving negative reviews, but this book was flat out boring for me.Too many story lines, with too many characters, and too many superfluous details. The character development was weak, not nearly enough to generate intrest for me. On top of that add the scattered time travel and alternate realities and the plot became too convoluted.The spirituality in the book is good stuff, but what is there is pretty basic, and there is not all that much of it.Readers looking for good spiritual fiction would be better off picking something else from my review list.Entertainment: 2 starsEnlightenment: 2 stars"
1,overblown and unbelievable very unchopra like,"as a chopra enthusiast, i was highly dissapointed with his first attempt at a novel. better keep to what you know, as they say."
2,"Don't Give up your DAY job, just yet!",There was too much attention paid to the periferals of the surrounding environment(s). It is as if to make the book longer he just used filler words. He took too long to get to the point. I cannot recommend this book. The adventure is dull and lacks the excitement of the Celestine Prophecy.
2,Super Reader,"Mordred has succeeded in doing bad things in the past, in the original time of Arthur.This book is mostly concerned with the present, and a young police officer named Arthur. Guess what happens next? Yep, the souls of all the Arthurian types eventually take over people in the present day, and the actual owners of these bodies begin to realise the roles they are playing in this conflict."
3,it works,"theyre nice speakers eventually they will get replaced by higher quality ones,but for know they work great"
4,Ark the lad,This game is a good game for those that like the overall story and like to mix things up often with a wide selection of members. It is a nice game that is challenging and has decent graphics as well. With enough content to keep players interested.
4,Pretty Good,It was quite interesting. As you play it tells you 2 different stories: one of a human and the other as a demon. I enjoyed playing it! It's pretty good!
3,"Good game, combat gets very repetitive","The story to this game progresses quite nicely and alternating story lines add to the interest. The combat, however, becomes quite repetitive after a while and starts to detract from the game. The use of voice acting is also quite inconsistent, with some cut-scenes using voice and others using text in seemingly the same sorts of situations."
5,Fantastic!!,"I'll keep this review short, as several people before me have already expounded upon the game in good detail, and I completely agree. The graphics are excellent, and perhaps what is more compelling is the story-line itself, which is totally captivating. It's easily one of my all-time favorite games because of the variability and uniqueness it has. It has my utmost recommendation."
4,Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits,Well this game is great the battles in the game are a little bit easy you dont have to at a high level to beat the game but it has a great story line. Kharg is a human/deimos and he is try ing to save the human race from the deimos. Darc is deimos/human and he is trying to kill the human race. Though out the game Kharg and Darc find out they are twin brothers trying to kill each other. at the end they team up to save the world. If you like the other Arc the Lad game this would be a great game to have.
2,I can't catch the little white lizard!,"This game would be really fun, but I'm only about an hour and a half into playing and I'm stuck at the pond where you have to catch the white lizard thing is. I tried everything to catch it for over an hour and finally got frustrated and turned it off and haven't played since. I really wanna play this game, but I don't know what to do!!"
4,My review,I think this is a realy good game. The graphics are good and the game play is fairly easy to undersand. This is a great game for anyone who enjoys a good adventure. The description on the game that amazon.com gave explains the game well but like all the others the number of players was not told.
1,This is false advertising,"This product does NOT support APS. You must purchase a separate adapter, which Amazon does not even sell. The power button on this shoddy piece of equipment broke after only two presses, to boot. Caveat Emptor."
1,Ineffecient and Demanding...better luck next time...,"this scanner turned out to be a [price] paper weight because of its enormous time consumption for very simple projects.1. this was not at all compatible with Win 98 or Win xp home/pro2. the quality of the slide scans were great but took 2-3 mins at a time plus the processing time of the computer. people with a pentium 3 or lower should stay away.3. there is no option (at least that i noticed) to scan at lower resolutions, types, or bit depths so i ended up with 300 x 200 pixel images sizing up at 6.6 mb.4. i also purchased the auto slide feeder which had frequent problems with jamming (grabbing too many slides at once).using the hp scanjet 5470c with the film adapter was much quicker and more affordable yielding the same results as the nikion scanner.the nikion super coolscan 4000 is not the choice when it comes to time constraints, computer compatiblity, presentations, and web use."
2,Unsharp at edges,"Unfortunately there is a problem with the Super Coolscan 4000 in that it does not produce an image that is sharp to the edges from film placed in a glassless slide mount (paper, plastic, etc.) This appears to be a lack of depth-of-field within the optical system. Using the selective focus feature doesn't help as some part of the image will be always out of focus. The Coolscan may produce a 4000 dpi scan, but it will not be sharp center-to-edge unless the film is absolutely flat -rarely the case. This problem offsets any advantage of using high-quality optics on your camera. This is a situation where the (excellent) specifications do not give the true indication of the results."
2,Unsharp at edges,"Unfortunately there is a problem with the Super Coolscan 4000 in that seems unable to produce an image that is sharp to the edges from film placed in a glassless slide mount (standard paper, plastic, etc.) This appears to be a lack of depth-of-field within the optical system. Using the selective focus feature doesn't help as some part of the image will be always out of focus. The Coolscan may produce a 4000 dpi scan, but it will not be sharp center-to-edge unless the film is absolutely flat -rarely the case. This problem offsets any advantage of using high-quality optics on your camera. This is a situation where the (excellent)specifications do not give the true indication of the results."
3,Windows XP Users Beware,"This may be a great scanner - I don't know yet. As a Windows XP user, I've been trying to get this scanner operational for 2 weeks. Nikon only has a download for this scanner that is compatible with Windows XP. Downloading it is a pain and if you don't have Winzip, you have to purchase it... Next, the download instructions are difficult to follow, so if you have to call tech support - good luck. After waiting for over an hour four separate times to speak to technicians, I've found that they're not helpful, and in fact, very rude. I'm sure that once I get the scanner running, I'll love it. It's just been a very disappointing experience so far."
1,Cancelled,"Unfortunatly, word has come in that this game has been cancelled by Encore, so it probably wasn't a very good game and wasn't coming along well."
2,"While the book is funny at times, it lacks depth.","I must admit that the reason that I bought this book is because I enjoy reading fiction written by Mexican-Americans. This book did have its good parts. For example, the fact that the narrator lives in a house that was once the set of ""Leave it to Beaver,"" adds to our understanding of the all-American life that the father is trying to provide for his children. However, the book lacked depth. Sure, it was funny at times, but that is all I got out of it. While the voice is captivating, it lacks credibility at times. Some parts of the book seem contrived, and this takes away from the story that Diaz is trying to tell."
1,0 STARS!,"Thank God this person only sold it for under 10 bucks, a complete waste of money, this is the cheesiest excuse for pop/rock or whatever it is I've ever listened to. The lyrics are complete corn, the music sounds like it was made in the garage, and Miss ""Cassandra"" can't sing, oh my. This band belongs in the recesses of the 80's music catalog, I am ashamed Blonde Enuff is on here representing South Florida's music scene..I thought this would be an empowering rock album with a feminine edge like all those others out there: alanis/garbage/no doubt...but alas."
5,Relaxed...,"I loved this movie. The other reviewers are right, I guess the story could be seen as boring. But if you care about the characters, then it's not. It's a typical teenage movie in a sense that the crisis is a relationship struggle which seems petty to everyone else but to a self-involved teen is important. So there's no graphic violence or sex, just relationships. The characters are not typical teenage-movie stereotypes, though.The ambience of the film is great. It's got a laid-back feel and strange characters. Like I said, the main plot is about a relationship, but I love the scenery, it reminded me of family vacations past.This is not a life-changing movie. Don't expect to get shaken up, and if you really need directors to prode you to love their characters then you'll be dissappointed. It's an extrememly well-made, pleasant diversion and character-study. It's got great songs, too, btw. Highly recommended. At least rent it."
4,summer movie,"we think that this is a perfect coming of age movie to view in the summer. the cast was well chosen, especially the two little boys in their first role. they did well. have fun with this summer flick!"
3,Good little movie for fans of offbeat fare,"""Swimming"" is a pleasant, watchable slice-of-life drama, but in its zeal not to make any judgements or draw any conclusions about its characters, the end result is a little muddy. Still, many of its characters, especially the one played by Lauren Ambrose (of ""Six Feet Under"" fame), are likable and engaging, and- at ninety minutes or so- the movie doesn't overstay its welcome. Recommended for those who enjoy Sundance/indie-style movies. A small handful of blink-and-you'll-miss-them bonus features revolve around the world of independent film and the Sundance Film Festival, rather than the movie ""Swimming"" itself."
3,The Ambrose Flick,"Ok, to start, this movie is just pretty good. It's nothing spectacular, that's for sure. It's a bit quiet, and you'll probably find yourself asking why some of the characters even exist, but one thing you won't ask is why is Lauren Ambrose headlining? This is really her movie. If nothing else in this film works she certainly does. I've loved her ever since Can't Hardly Wait and she is really the only reason why I like this movie as much as I do."
2,Another bland teen movie...,"""Swimming"" only succeeded in one area: showing the boredom of small town life. However, the acting ranged from over-the-top charicatures (Nicola and the Hawaiian boyfriend) to bland underacting (Lauren Ambrose & the rest of the cast). While Ambrose's attempt was noble, for the most part she gave an one-dimensional performance. The directing was okay if somewhat hoaxy and limited at times (I guess I just wanted more). The writing was probably the most horrible part to the movie. There were so many plot holes that caused me to ask, ""What was the point of that?"" In the end, ""Swimming"" is an okay movie to waste sometime with, but don't expect to find any meaning or profound performances. ""Swimming"" is just like Myrtle Beach, nothing really happens."
2,Kinna boring!,"This could had been a very good movie but the story is too boring. The actor are good and beliveable. I like the atmosphere of the movie, the main actress, the one who play Frankie is very good but the story is weird, Frankie seem interest in a new girl but start to be interest in a new guy who act very geeky but who is cute in a way, both situation are not explore and we wonder what happen of it, the story don't tell. Rent it but don't buy it."
2,"Basic, lacks new data, not well organized",It truly is a teaser book to sell his seminar and his companies services. It did go over some basic techniques however that help the new investor make more with their limited capital.
1,P.T. Barnum would be proud.,"Before becoming a stock market genius in the nineties, Wade Cook was peddling get rich quick with real estate schemes. He published several books in the 80's (How to build a real estate money machine, for example), before losing his a** and declaring bankruptcy. Now he's bilking a whole new set of suckers. I can only believe that all the '10' reviews are Wade Cook plants. But if you just can't resist, go ahead and try it - you'll be sorely disappointed!"
2,Some solid advice and some smoke and mirrors!,Wade Cook should have stopped at the point he starts going on and on about the seminars and you could be the next Bill Gates by the end of the year. He does however give some good advice when applied properly (i.e. bottomfishing and covered call writing) although to go after cheap stocks and apply these principles to companies with shady or no track records is a mistake for novice investors. Be careful how much stock you put into this book. Like everything in life if it sounds to good to be true...
4,Exciting Cash Flow Stretegies,"Wade Cook may have an unusual past as a cab driver turned investment strategy advisor but his techniques bring to light ways to increase your monthly cash flow in the stock market. While his strategies can be used as a sole method of accumulating wealth such as rolling stock, writing covered calls, stock splits and naked options, most people will use this information as a starting point to further education in one facet of their investment portfolio. Personally, I have used two of his strategies successfully and continue to follow his methods. The book reads very well and easy to understand even for the novice. If not for the recurring advertising for his other products in the book, I would give it a 10. It definitely prompted me to read his next book called ""Stock Market Miracles"""
4,"Good strategies, but not for the inexperienced trader","Cook's WSMM has many good strategies, however they are forexperienced traders. Those who have no experience or knowledge ofeconomics, supply and demand, interest rates, and stocks and options trading should first read fundamental books and do a lot of research."
4,Really makes you stop and wonder,"A fabulous book that will have you wondering why you been slaving at a 9-5 job! He makes it sound easy, but always leaves you hanging for ""a little bit more""."" the hidden message in this book is "" its possible to mack mucho $$$...BUT, only with a lot of study, dedication, some free cash, and of couse, some luck. REMEMBER...""the more you study and learn, the luckier you will be"" This book can really start a fire in some souls."
3,A BOOK WORTH READING.,"This is a very informative book, but it leaves the reader with more unanswered questions. It also does not help the reader with finding the answers with some of the methodology unless you go to one of the seminars ( which are very expensive ). The average person could learn these strategies simply by studying and doing the research themselves. To be successful in the stock market, it depends on one's own convictions and how much time one wishes to commit."
1,The IRS will love this book.,"I read 3/4 of this book last weekend. Not a single novel idea to be seen. Essentially no details, other than the incredibly repetitive ramblings about his life and the myriad of other products Cook would like to sell us. If you enjoy infomercials on TV, you'll love this book. No discussing of any downside risk (oh, well maybe two sentences worth, just to make the lawyers happy). Most amazingly, no discussion of the tax implications of trading using these techniques. If you've never heard of the IRS's ""wash-sale rule"" you are going to be in for a rude surprise come April 15th."
1,Not all the Facts,"The book is very exciting to read and gives a good explaination of option strategies. What is not mentioned in the book is that the spread can kill you. I have tried his method and to date I have lost over 10,000. Some how I managed to do this while showing the IRS a 7,800 gain for tax year 97. To Make matters worse it appears that Margin interest is an itemized deduction. My total itemized deductions were just short of the standard deduction. It definitly looks like I will have to get a second job."
1,Buy a lotto ticket instead...,"I wonder why Wade's stock (WADE) has dropped from 5 to less than 2 since January? Doesn't he know there's a bull market on? Maybe he's running out of suckers??? I wish he'd leave Seattle; we're getting a bad reputation. I'd also like to get off his mailing list--litteraly 2-4 junk mailings a week for the last three months! This book is a total waste of time and money. I can only imagine that all the ""10's"" appearing on this page are plants by Wade himself! Take my advice: buy a lotto ticket!"
3,"Good book, but his strategies don't always work","Good, simple, and well-written book, but makes reader think he can never go wrong. The ideas stated in the book are very logical and make sense, but in reality, don't always work out right. For instance, buy on dips. But how do you the stock will not dip any farther? You don't! These strategies will work for someone who is lucky. However, I enjoyed reading the book, and it is quite informative."
2,Wall Street Money Machine,"I think the book is very basic and elementary. Although, I didn't know much about stocks, reading this book did not help much. The rolling stocks mentioned in the book are not rolling any longer so we could not use it as reference. He repeats the unimportant material over and over and over. The books are basically massive advertising for his seminars. The book is very general. I think the whole thing could've been summarized in 50 pages maximum. I was very disappointed. If I wanted advertising, I would get info channel. One whole chapter he talks about how his business is not a day trade and how his feeling were hurt that an interviewer called it that. I was particullarly interested in rolling stocks which was a small portion of the book. I will not buy another book from Wade Cooke. I don't think he is a good writer. Most of his books are mostly chatter. I shared the book in my study group, we all feel the same way about this book."
1,Three things I have to say about this book.,"First, Wade Cook makes stock and option markets so glam. Lie! The book praised the big returns but never talk about the downside risks. Two, the author throw you a sale pitch all over the book, saying that you have to go to his Wall Street Work Shop. I mean, I bought a book not a magazine... Three, the book talked about the same concepts over and over again, but never addressed how to PICK A GOOD STOCK to begin with. I gave it a 2 because it at least will give you some idea of options, but don't rely on it solely to trade options."
1,Look before you leap!,"Want a successful formula for writing/ selling an investment book? Promise readers that they can make a lot of money with little work and retire in under a year. This is exactly what Wade Cook claims repeatedly in his book without backing up his claims with hard numbers. Beware!I am a professional trader and I sell options as part of my investment activities. When you combine the potential for unlimited losses with leverage you are lighting matches in a fuel tank. Do not be lulled into thinking it's an easy, sure-fire way to make money. It takes a lot of time and experience. There are no shortcuts. If you take in $1.00 of premium and the stock drops $2.00, you've lost $1.00, period.If you do insist on trying any of Wade's unoriginal strategies, do yourself a favor and either paper-trade or trade in very small quantites until you develop a feel for what's involved. This, by the way, is another thing Wade fails to suggest in his book."
3,Do your homework before using any strategies,"This book has some good ideas but anybody about to invest should temper these ideas with plenty of other viewpoints(fundamental and technical) before putting their hard-earned money into any stocks or options. Wade is very enthusiastic about his methods but hardly emphasizes that loss is a very real possibility in the stock market, especially when options are involved. Test his strategies on paper before you invest, get as many other viewpoints as you can, and you might become successful. I can also do without Wade's shameless(or is the word ""tasteless""?) plugs in the book for his $4000+ Wall Street Workshop that claim to turn you into a ""market whiz"" in two days"
1,For Gamblers And Dreamers. Sad.,"First, a disclaimer: I have never read this book. however, I did watch the tape that advertises for Wade's products. This message is for those of you who are not compulsive gamblers and are simply looking for legitimate trading strategies. Don't walk, RUN away from Wade Cook and his methods. Not only are his methods bad, but you will absorb his psychology-- the psychology of market loser. Initiate a position to do a covered call? (a Wade Cook special) get real. Use a covered call to hedge an already establised positon maybe, but it is flat out dumb to initiate such a position simply to collect the premium. This position is called a synthetic put. Just sell a put and you will have the same thing. Better yet, stay away for options or play them just occasionally for recreation (just like a recreational gambler in a casino, or in the same spirit you would buy a lottery ticket)."
3,A 220-page infomercial!,"Although Wade Cook gives some good, basic information on cash flow enhancement strategies, be careful not to get suckered into paying thousands of dollars more for his live seminars and W.I.N. online service. Use this book as a launching pad to further your investment knowledge through other books and investment sources available on the Internet"
1,The most expensive book you will ever buy!!,"This is a perfect book that will rid you of all money worries. If you follow the hype the book is all about, at the end you wont have any money to worry about. There are supposedly success stories using this ""new and incredible"" strategies (BTW, there is nothing new in the book, except the hype) but people get lucky also in casinos and lottery. If you can't resist this book, do yourself a favor, before putting any money into market, read some other book, like the one by Dr. A. Elder, ""Trading for a living"", and you will see what the game is all about: discipline and money management. You won't find that in Cook's book."
1,please do not buy this book !- It is worthless,"I have had 15 years of experience trading options. I know almost every option strategy you can think of. Yes you can make money on options .BUT you have to know what you are doing, work hard and be willing to lose money. Mr. Wade makes it sound too easy! There should be a law prohibiting this!. How does he make his money? through the the very expensive misleading courses and audio tapes.! Do you really want to learn about options: buy ""Options As A Strategic Investment"" by Lawrence McMillan. This guy is a real prof not a money grapper!"
1,Do the Maths!,Wade Cook's strategies are not statistically sound (do some basic statistical probability research on his strategies) and in the long run will inevitably result in losses - potentially catastrophic. While there may be some (lucky) short term wins - these strategies are highly volatile and can be statistically proved to produce a loss over time. KEEP WELL CLEAR!
1,I smell shills,"I came here to read reviews of this book, which I heard about on the radio, and was considering buying. After reading several obvious ""advertisements"" posing as reviews, I've come to the conclusion that this guy must be some sort of sleazy crook. They're not even clever enough to make them SOUND like real reviews."
2,"Read the book, do the rest by yourself!","Book is OK to read. But do your own work, and do not buy the rest stuff he wants to sell you. There is no free lunch! Do you own work if you want to make money, and take your own risk. All the ideas in the book need to be carefully tested by a person who is willing to read more from other sources. Mr. Cook is a smart guy, but do not fall into his sale's trap!"
1,"One Long Commercial for His Seminars, etc.","I can't say it much better than has been said in several of these other reviews. This is the poorest book I've ever read on investing. Wade Cook's main goal in publishing this book must be to find more suckers to sign up for his OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive seminars, as they are mentioned over and over in the book. And once he gets your name and address you will be bombarded with his junk mail for months and months. Save your money, and don't let him know where you live."
1,First - rate SCAM!,"Buy this book only if: 1. You are researching financial scams. 2. You are a used car salesman and would like to perfect your sales technique. 3. You are shopping for a present for your worst enemy and want him/her to go broke.In short, the strategies presented in this book work sometimes, but apparently they didn't work very well for the author. That's why he turned to making some real money by selling his grossly super-hyper-overpriced 'seminars'. In any case, most of what is useful in this book is available from much better sources from people who know the business.Incidentally, if you want to have a lot of fun, see the review of this book on the Motley Fool Website. For even more laughs, take a look at Wade's company financial information (available free on the Web)."
2,"A general introduction to stock options, but beware!","Distinctive only for its hawking of the author's seminars. OK on stock options, but Lawrence Macmillan's OPTIONS AS A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT is much better. Cook's ""rolling stock"" concept, his term for buying at support and selling at resistance, works only in non-trending markets. Weak on determining the short-term trend of stocks, essential in buying or selling stock options. Cook's dividend-capturing strategy works sporadically, and this is before accounting for commissions and the spread. Not enough on risk--how to determine it, and how to deal with it."
4,"Good book, but too many commercials.","The book held my interest very well, and stimulated my interest enough that I've jumped in the world of options. If you're new to investing, though, there's a lot of basics skimmed past or left out altogether. If I'd read this book five years ago I would have been lost.The most annoying part of the book is Cook's endless pitching of his seminars and other services. You'll become very familiar with his 800 number.There's also inadequate recognition of the down side to his methods, and possibility of losing money. If his methods were as consistently effective as his examples, Mr. Cook would control all the wealth on Earth today.I don't mean to be too negative - much of the book actually makes investing exciting. Just take it with a grain of salt."
5,Excellent tapes done personally by Wade,"These tapes are actually from the first Wall Street Money Machine book that came out in 1997. The concepts are the same...Rolling Stocks, Options onStock Splits, Stock Split Strategies, Covered Calls and two strategies which have been deleted in the newer books, Dividend Capturing and Section 29 Tax Credits.The information is excellent, timeless and in Wades own voice.Great companion to Wall Street Money Machine Volume 1 and Two Bad Years and Up We Go. Two audio cassettes packed with information. And you Wade Cook bashers, only slight mention of the Wall Street Workshops. Wade also mentions Barron's, Investors Business Daily and Wall Street Journal."
5,Read & Grow rich with Wade's strategies,"I made $5,000 in four days using the options on stock splits strategy on just one stock play! I am excited! Thanks WADE!"
5,Great Book for all traders!,"This book is great for experienced stock traders or people just starting. I read the first 90 pages in the store. I ended up purchasing it because I couldn't put it down. Easy reading and full of examples. I've made 47% in the last month with things I've leaned from the ""rolling stocks"" section. Covered call section is also great. I haven't used that yet. Good job Wade!"
4,Not Mayberry,"While this case generated a lot of sideshow publicity, the constant refrain of how innocent Dolly Parton's home county is just doesn't ring true. Local news is full of reports of violence and crime around the county. The tourist mecca may be safe, but the homegrown good old boys can be downright nasty."
4,Lowercase's best effort thus far,Lowercase seems to be just getting better with each record. Similar to Unwound.
3,Grandfathers Fortune..... to Kill For ?,"The setting for the story is a island in Savannah Ga , The grandfather pass's away and the family all gathers thinking they will get an inhertance but grandad leaves it to his favorite grandaughter (Charolette ) .Charolette and husband Royce is out on other end of Island at there place, when someone shots Royce in the leg ,but was the bullet meant for Charolette since other family members are mad because she inherits the fortune.....And why did grandad change his will and dis inherit other family members ? You got to read it to find out SORRYThis story has several characters and you really have to stay focused to keep up with what character the author is talking about .Time consuming but overall a good read."
5,Powerful and filled with Energy,"I love this album. The music is powerful and there are some truly great guitar riffs and keyboard solos. Even my 8 and 10 year old are constantly asking me to play this album. If you liked ASIA's Silent Nation, you'll like this album, too. Personally, I think it's better than Silent Nation. Has more of a raw quality to it, but the skill of the musicians is flaunted and exceptional."
1,Overproduced ASIA Wanna be,"John payne is not a very good lyricist, and very much over sings. This album as pently of both. I wante dto like it, as I was a fan of his time in ASIA, but it was clear he needed Downes to reel him in. Pass on this. Go get Erotic cakes by Goven though, he is a master"
3,Worth reading if you have an interest in the band Hawkwind.,"This book, written by a proven SF/Fantasy author, is not his best work, but has a definite interest for the reader who has knowledge of the band Hawkwind and would like to see its members immortalized in fiction. The plot moves along slowly, and it has not aged well. The hippy vs straight concept is well outdated, but it is a amusing blast from the past for the readers of more current styles of SF."
1,don't buy,I bought this camera and mistakenly kept it in my pocket. Lens completely fills with dust. Its a manufacturing flaw when the lens retracts it creates a suction which sucks dust into the sensor. There is no way to clean it except to send it back. Do not buy this camera.
3,Oleg St.,"I bought this camera to replace my trueold Canon G5. What a mistake! This one is no match. G5 had a solid semi-pro feeling in its built and behavior. The G7 has a ""toy"" and ""plastic"" feeling about it. It may be good for those who just started into digital photography, but I would not recommend it for those, who is looking for more serious or advanced device in non-dslr market niche.Amazon did great when I returned it, so three stars are because of their good customer service."
3,"Typical P&S, noisy sensor",Unfortunately this camera suffers from marginal image quality due to the small sensor crammed with too many pixels. This is typical of all manufacturers these days. Handling is also a weak point with the G7. It may look cool without a grip but it's very difficult to use and the risk of dropping it is much higher than average. It has some nice features but overall I'd recommend looking at something in the A-series from Canon - and stay away from the 10-12 megapixel cameras.
1,Bad One,"Have had an Olympus 4.0M.for 4 years and been very happy with it. As a gift I got this Canon and was very diappointed in the color quality and sharpness. Shot about 600 pictures people were blurred,not crisp and dim even on a sunny day. Had to return it.Don't buy"
3,"Big, black and ...ugly...?",Unfurtunely this camera is uncomfortable to use. The worst fault: you can see part of lens while you are wathing trhu viewfinder. The neck strap is very thin. A wrist strap could be better.
4,I love this camera,"There are some things I wish were different, but they're relatively minor. First I'd like to say that the lack of RAW format is not a big deal. This is after all a compact, point-and-shoot camera. I get the feeling that the reviewers complaining about the lack of RAW probably wouldn't use it anyway. I think some of them just want to show off how sophisticated they are. I wish the battery could be removed without first removing the quick-release mount. I wish the grip were better, especially a place to put my thumb. The shutter is loud and a remote would be great to have. I use an inexpensive monopod for stability. The camera is tough and rugged and it takes really nice photos, and I like the included software."
4,Just a good camera.,"I have bought this camera as a substitute of my previous Sony DSC-V3. I'm satisfied with my purchase, but I miss infrared NightFraming and NightShot functions, which my previous camera had."
5,simply the best,"I wont be long winded here, but this is simply the best camera in its class. It does everything and everything well. yes, there might be some small glitches but I haven't found them and I am an experienced photographer having used both consumer and professional camera's...this is simply the best point and shoot around. I am done now."
5,Great camera but still too bulky for me,"This camera takes great photos, its just too big for me to carry around without feeling like a dork and enjoying what I'm doing. Again, takes great pictures, just not for me."
1,Quit after a year and a half,Avoid Cannon. Build quality is horrendous. No good reason caused this camera quit working. I bought the Panasonic LX3 as a replacement and will avoid any and all Cannon products. I remember how popular the AE1 was and what a horrible camera it actually turned out to be so I should have known better.
1,"""Lens error, restart camera""","Purchased this camera in Jan 2007, and last week received the infamous and well documented message, ""lens error, restart camera""."
5,Close to a DSLR but without the Bulk!,"I just got my camera and I love it. I was able to start shooting immediately; it is very easy to use. The LCD screen is good and you are able to see it. I know there have been complaints about the flip screen but I had a flip screen before and never really used it.There are a lot of shooting modes maybe not as much as some other smaller cameras but enough that you will have fun experimenting with them. The camera is fairly compact (smaller than a DSLR) but it is no elph, it does have some weight. It also feels a little slick but once you get use to holding it you shouldn't have to worry.The zoom is awesome and the image stabilizer works very well. The pictures have been great in color and clarity. I also find that it focuses quite easily and well.This is a fun great camera that is close to a DSLR but without the bulk!"
5,super,"i bought it 3 weeks ago, and i love it so far. It works very well at night and at low light. In day light it is really good. The video quality is very good .... I strongly recommend it"
2,If you want to use the hot-shoe do not buy this camera,"Using the hot-shoe results in an approximate 1 second (!) lag between shutter button press and capture - Very disappointing.Unless this can be fixed and will be, I would not recommend buying."
1,Lousy customer support - dust in lenses,"Beware of Canon customer support. I bought a G7 a year ago and after six month something that look like dust particle managed to get into the lens (all pictures and videos have a black dot). First I thought that I could clean than but then I realized the lenses are sealed. Then I wondered, if the lenses are sealed the only way a particle of dust could have gotten there was when it was manufactured. Well, I call Canon and guess what; they offered me to send the camera for repair (at my expense) or a refurbished one for $250 dollars. If I knew how I would sue this company for utter irresponsibility. Now all my pictures and videos have a black dot thanks to Canon's lack of support. So long for a honey moon with Canon...Fernando"
2,Too pricy,"According to the January 2008 Consumer Reports Magazine, this camera should cost about $470. Wondering why it is so expensive on Amazon?"
5,Excellent Camera,I have used this camera for a few months and I LOVE it. I took a series of pictures at my nieces High School musical...it was a TERRIBLY dark theatre and I was at least 5 rows back and way off to the side and my pictures turned out amazing. This is EXACTLY why I bought this camera to capture shots in dark environments with lots of movement (I have 3 kids of my own). The pictures so far are BEAUTIFUL and amazingly even red eye has gotten better without the addition of another flash. Thank you CANON!
5,Have it since 2007,"I bought this item in 2007, my first digital camera. I am an amateur photographer, and before this, I had a Nikon F5 with professional lenses.As for the Canon G7, its practical, its photos are waaaay better than smaller point-and-shoot cameras, more adaptable to low and high light exposures, and has all flexibility in M-mode. Although newer versions are available now, I am still very happy with the one I have now. Great camera to have on tours, portable, and if needed, its fisheye and tele lenses are available."
3,Disappointing,"I received the G7 Friday and promptly returned it on Monday. Why? I expect much more from Canon's top of the line point-and-shoot. No grip, long lag time, LCD blanked out for seemd like a long time betwee shots, some over-exposed shots in auto mode.. to name a few.The G7 is definitely a good looking cemera. If you never owned a digital camera, G7 is for you.I also have the A620 and think the G7 is a lesser camera for twice the price. Yes, the G7 comes with IS, but I have not seen any significant improvement in my shots. For the price of the G7, you could almost buy 2 A640s! It reminded me of the early age of digital camera. You lived with less because that was all you had. You always wished for a little bit more in each camera. The G7 is in this category."
2,Disappointed,"I am a professional photographer, normally shooting a Nikon D200, However, i do a lot of shooting from the back of a horse, and sometimes a pont and shoot is what I need. My old Olympus Camedia finally died, which was a good camera. I bought a Panasonic Lumix, which is nice. However,the ease of putting the G7 in my pocketwas tempting so I thought I would try it. Being in Colorado at high altitudes, I needed the extension tube for the polarizer at certain times of the day. Once ths is on, you can no longer see much of the picture through the view finder, which you must use in bright light. All you pretty much see is the extension tube. Awful! The other problem is trying to hold it in one hand and take a picture is impossible. With no grip, your thumb goes over all of the menu buttons and the trash button. You can imagine how many things can happen there to keep you from getting a picture.The image is good, but it is clumsy in design, and often slow to focus as well."
3,died in less than 30 days,I got a g7 at the beginning of the month and it has all ready died with error 24. I am returning it and may not get another one. It does not have the canon raw mode and honestly I am not sure the pictures are better than my PowerShot S50. It also seemed more fragile than I expected.
1,Just say no to AMSI (AMbient Sound Imaging),"Not sure what led Deutsche Grammophon/Universal to use AMSI (AMbient Sound Imaging), a kind of simulated ""surround"". To use an analogy, it's like colorizing a good B/W film. The use of AMSI was one of the WORST mistakes DG/Universal has ever made in terms of sound engineering. The stereo image completely loses focus via this ""technology"". This is especially bad news for EARLY DIGITAL RECORDINGS, which lack ""focus"" and imaging to begin with. AMSI does not make the recording sound better. Too bad -- the track selection chosen for Fur Elise is quite good."
4,Love It,I thoroughly enjoyed all of the pieces on the cd. Even my 6 year old son request to listen to this cd at night as he sleeps. It's a great buy.
4,AN HST RIDE!,"If you liked Hunter Thompson's writing, esp. ""Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas"" and ""Curse of Lono"" you will like this book. You would also probably like his two other novels ""Flight to Freedom"" and ""The Whorehouse"". Granted, he is not Thompson but comparable in content and still with us as far as I know. Wright can't replace the good doctor but he'll still take you on a trip!"
4,The Slut Rocks N Rolls,I thought the Whorehouse could dance up a storm and tell a story but the Music Sluts is the new queen of the hood.
4,good conclusion to the series,"Michael Phillips did a good job of bringing the Heathersleigh series to a conclusion in this book. True to his style, Phillips faithfully explored the ideas of the time, whether they're popular now or not. He provided direction for each of the characters' futures, and I liked the further development of Geoffrey and his relationships. Timothy Diggorsfeld's storyline seems a bit contrived. I was satisfied with the way Phillips explored the relationship of God to man and ideas of forgiveness. I felt rewarded by the revelation of the mystery that has built about the Rutherfords' family secrets -- but Phillips told the story in a way that made me feel like I was part of the discovery instead of having him just unload an unsuspected surprise on me at the end. All in all, a worthwhile book for the mind and soul -- as well as being a good read, if you've enjoyed the three preceding books in the series."
3,Would've made a great zombie army builder...,"I bought this quite some time ago, and really wish I'd bought more to build a zombie army as I can't justify the cost to do so now. Anyway, the rolling shield thing that comes with the figures is lame and totally useless, and if you aren't very careful when posing the razor thin limbs on these figures they'll be broken in no time flat. Further, they will not stand at all without the included figure stands. You now know all you need to know to make a purchasing decision.Getting back to the zombie army bit, I particularly like the figure without the helmet and a dozen or so would be perfect. Off to the auctions then..."
4,Easy Format For Daily News,"I must admit that the Kindle format is far easier to read than paper. All articles are just a click away7 with no paging through to find the other half. I hav 2 complaints that take away a star... No saturday paper, and no comics."
1,Horrible Delivery Record,Subscibing to the Denver Post makes it all too clear why newspapers are a dying industry. For almost two months the Post has been completely unreliable and no one will take responsibility. Amazon says that the problem is at the Denver Post and that I need to contact them directly. The Post claims that they don't sell subscriptions via the Kindle and that I must have them confused with a different newspaper. There is no one to explain why they have suddenly been so unreliable and there is no one who can explain why and when they are likely to get better. This is my local paper and I would really like to read it.
2,Late every day,"With the last reviewer, I'm really unhappy with the delivery over the last two weeks. The 'sorry, the Denver Post will be late today' message was disappointing the first time, is just plain irritating the 12th or 13th time. I'd been really pleased with the subscription until this started - no newspaper waste, ability to read my hometown paper wherever I woke up. This is only a recent development, so whatever changed...please change back! Without the delivery problems, I'd go five stars."
3,Denver Post Kindle Edition Good - Could Be Better,"I've had my Kindle for two weeks and the Denver Post has been delivered successfully and promptly every day. The portion of the ""paper"" that I receive is good, but there is some content that is missing. It seems that the opinion section is particular falls short of the printed paper. I would really like to read letters to the editor. Adding the comics wouldn't be bad either, although that is not a make it or break it thing for me. Would bump up to 4 or 5 stars if more content was available."
2,The Denver Post,"I am a subscriber to the Kindle version of the Denver Post, and havebeen for months now. I would like to complain about the quality. It isconsistently poor. Namely formatting mistakes, incomplete sentences,many spacing mistakes, frequently the same article will be includedtwice in the same issue, poor editing, the wrong picture for thearticle, etc. Just poor quality!For example, the very first article in today's issue has 5 mistakes inthe first paragraph, 4 in the third paragraph, and many more throughoutthe article.The Denver Post said that Amazon was responsible for the formatting. It is poor, either way."
3,"Not bad, but not worth paying for a subscription","I recently received a Kindle DX, and while the device is wonderful, reading the Denver Post has been mediocre at best. There are few pictures, no comics, and the layout is just like a book on the Kindle. Part of the reason I got a DX was because the larger screen real estate would allow newspapers and magazines to present a better product to us, the readers. I'm hoping that as the DX becomes more widespread, newspapers will start formatting their content in a more interesting and natural feeling manner. Until then though, I've canceled my 14-day free trial and won't be looking at any other papers until they start creating DX optimized versions. As a side note, I don't mind paying for news content that I could get for free off the internet, but in order to entice me to pay, the newspaper/magazine needs to be better then what is on the internet and more closely approximate the feeling of holding a newspaper or magazine."
2,Solution? Shift the blame!,"I wouldn't go to the trouble of posting a negative review if I had any success with either Kindle customer service or the Denver Post. They each point to the other when there are missing features. (Post: ""We send them the material, but we don't have control over what they print or how they format""; Kindle: ""We can only print what they send us""). I'm continually surprised by the apparent lack of pride and professionalism that is usually associated with publishing a quality newspaper. Today I came upon the print edition and discovered an entire page (inside front cover) of 8 small items missing from the Kindle edition. Unbelievable!"
4,Great!,"It is very good that this newspaper is on the kindle because very morning my mom, dad and I love to read the Denver Post every morning. But unfortunatly I just tried the 14 day trial because now we order the Denver Post every morning..."
1,Delivery,"Signed up and got the paper yesterday. Today I got a download that says ""Sorry, The Denver Post will be late today"" Now 12:46pm and still no paper."
1,Thanks for the comments.,Was thinking the Kindle edition of the Denver Post might be an improvement over home delivery but it sounds like the Post is consistent across its media. Both Home Delivery and the Kindle edition are late. Or both end up in the (virtual or actual) bushes/snowbank/neighbor's yard. I'll pass. Seems silly to pay the expense for the NY Times when you live in DENVER but it might be the only option to get the news daily.
1,The Democratic Scribe,"The Denver Post is so totally biased towards the democratic party, that it could serve as the party's official newsletter and campaign aide. Obama is definitely the ""chosen one"", and Republican candidates at all levels arescum fodder."
1,Lefty Rag,This paper has become as far left as the NYT! Their reporters and columnist can't seem to manage an independent thought but simply repeat what all the liberals say. Hope it goes under lie the rest of the print media. Just like Newsweek.
3,Local Papers are BORING,I am cancelling/switching my subscription to the IHT (International Herald Tribune). Local news and stuff is really tiring to read. Huge metro papers and things like Analog are what you want to get instead.
2,Unreliable Delivery,"It is nice having a text version of the news available first thing in the morning, but over my three month subscription, and especially in these last few weeks as noted in other reviews, the paper was not delivered. First it was just the Sunday edition (which I really enjoyed), but when the Monday daily wasn't available, it was time to pull the plug."
2,Disappointed,"I really wanted this to work so that I could take the paper with me and read it more thoroughly when I have a little time. However during my 2 week free trial the Sunday papers were not delivered both times, no explanation. So you really only get the paper 5 days a week. I won't be continuing my subscription."
3,Hoping things get better for the Post,"I've been a subscriber for going on 2 years now. Glitch here and there made delivery late, but I survived so that I could get my Bronco news. A couple of weeks ago, the Post announced a cutback in employees and it's obvious that some must have been involved in the Kindle edition. Content has gone down by almost 50%. I'm going to keep it for a little while longer to give them a fair chance."
5,thanks for the access,It is great to have access to quality regional newspapers like the Post. Free content on the WEB does not equal the full version.
3,"Looking at the Kindle2, and a Denver Post subscription","I'm doing some research and looking at the Kindle2. Several things have come to mind. Most of the reviews I read are somewhat old, but I am wondering if the Denver Post issues have been resolved? Another reviewer noted that it was no wonder that the Newspapers are dying out (delivery), I'm not so sure it is the lack of delivery so much as the type of content of the news and free access on the internet. If delivery is an issue I would hesitate to subscribe to the paper, although I have to chuckle, reading the reviews here brings me to think of the ""Delivery Boy"" problems... Did you bother to look in the bushes for your newspaper? LOL sorry, couldn't help it!"
3,Convenience does not make up for print absences,"I have quickly adapted to the Kindle version of the Denver Post and will keep my subscription; however, I would hope that in time they will include the following: sports box scores; team standings; puzzles-crosswords etc.; more graphics, like charts and various statistical listing information; as well as the obligatory comics, photographs and weather."
5,good book,good introduction to programming through the use of visual basic. how about one for the java language?
2,Don't Let the Title Fool You!,"This book was rather dissatisfying because it didn't spend nearly enough time talking about how he made his money (short answer: he is a best selling financial-advice author and leveraged that fame to selling financial software = royalties!).The book spends most of its time on a rambling (was there an editor??) account of his mis-dealings in real estate and social causes.Definitely NOT a how-to book, I didn't find it as entertaining as a memoir either.However, I *am* a fan of Tobias, and think his ""Only Investment Guide"" book is rather good."
4,Good,"This book is a random mish-mash of incidents (most of them financially oriented) in Tobias's life. It is hit or miss. But the bits that hit, hit the bulls-eye. Tobias can be a wonderful humorist, and his wit is on display on many of these pages."
1,Big Let Down,"After reading and enjoying The Only Investment Guide You Will Ever Need, I was really looking forward to My Vast Fortune for some insight into what Andrew Tobias did with all the wealth he has amassed. Unfortunately, rather than elucidating his passionate conviction for various social causes, he mostly rants about his ineffectual exploits into auto insurance reform, property management and anti-smoking campaigns, and boasts smugly of his ""vast fortune"" as if to belittle the reader. His comparison to Don Quixote is certainly not unfair as they both suffer from delusions of grandeur. As Andrew himself would recommend, don't waste your money."
5,Smart Partnering Works,I liked Partnering Intelligence for three main reasons: 1. I believe the principles Steve Dent espouses. I think they are true and I know they can work. 2. I appreciate the clear examples used throughout the book to show how the ideas are translated into the workplace. 3. The many tools and assessments that Steve includes are a great model of his own desire to partner with the reader by offering practical ways that the ideas can be put into practice by others.I know that I will be using the materials in this book to good effect in my consulting work over the next few years. Thanks to Steve for his hard work in putting together this excellent field-guide to building effective partnerships.
5,quick review to add 5 stars,i love clarissa explains it all! it is a hillarious teenager t.v. show! i think anyone would love it! melissa j. hart is a good actress in this.
4,A good start..........,"To a great series of classic Nick shows. It's very exciting news for people who grew up and loved nick in it's best years.Lets just hope that they get to Are you Afraid of the Dark, Alex Mack, All That, and Rocko's Modern Life(My favorite show of all time!!!)The episodes were okay, but I have to give credit because it is the shows first season and it gets better.I loved the Nick time capsule. I totally remembered most of them(the disco dogs is one)So yeah, great episodes and great quality.Nickelodeon, keep them coming!!!Can't wait to buy Pete and Pete!!!"
5,"Season One, Number One!","This was a well put together DVD. The Nick time capsule highlighting what the network looked liked during 1991 - 1993, the time period when Clarissa first hit the air was a great feature. All the season one episodes (13 total) were funny but the three that stood out were ""Clarissa Makes a Cake""; where she and her friend Sam attempt to make a cake for her parents' anniversary, ""Brain Drain""; where Clarissa's brother Ferguson scores high on an IQ test and the two siblings team up to compete on a quiz show (they lose) and ""School Picture"" where Clarissa, a true individual in the area of fashion, sets out to avoid dressing as her mother wants her to (""dweebie"" in her estimation).I highly recommend this DVD to children and their parents. The writing is classic, not dated. Clarissa is just as enjoyable in 2009 as in was in the early 1990's.Viacom, please release the remaining seasons!"

4,Who she was?,"Melissa Joan Hart was totally different back then, before she was Sabrina the Teenage Witch. If anyone recognizes Melissa Joan Hart, they'll remember one person Sabrina Spellman. One person who was Clarissa Explains it all was Joe O'Connor, who played the father of the kid who kidnapped Salem. He also played a Dean, tearing down houses in Sabrina Episode. Two people I know who were discovered in the show was,Dawson's Creek James Van Der Beek, who Clarissa met in a party and Buffy the Vampire Slayer Michelle Trachtenberg. One episode I remember Michelle Trachtenberg in, where Clarissa babysits the annoying little girl Elsie Soaperstein is the same episode I saw in Sabrina the Teenage Witch the doll story. It was the episode where Sabrina babysits Amanda her annoying cousin that was played by Emily Hart, Melissa Joan Hart's sister. She came a long way back then, she was the only first person to make it big from Nickelodeon spot light."
1,Clarissa's explanations leave much to be desired,"As far as a comprehensive textbook on everything, this show was not very good. Noticeably missing were explanations on the Thirty Years War, the film ""Grumpier Old Men"", and the band ""Three Doors Down""."
3,A gift,"The grand baby loved it- However, his slightly older sister had no trouble losing nearly all of the gears. Oops!"
4,Super busy!,My 1-year old daughter LOVES this! Even my 4-year old and the 2 year old I babysit get into the fun. The music is a little loud for my taste (and I didn't see a volume switch) which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
1,Boring toy with too many pieces for the target age,Our girls received this toy for Christmas. it was fun for about 5 minutes and they haven't revisited it. Carrying handle is a joke - if you try to carry it with the handle all the gears fall off. Too many pieces with no place to secure them for the target age group.
3,fun for a while...,"I got this at a garage sale for 25cents with all the peices. i dont know how long it was used before, but it was still in perfect conditionmy 3year old got tired of it after a day, my 4 month old watches it, she may like it more when she can hit the button to make it go. she currently likes chewing on the peices more.i personallly think it is pretty boring, and it is not very interactive. you can move the gears around and change it up by colors and sort it best you can, but same tune everytime. but it is a good toy for babys who can figure out how to hit the button, just wont last long"
3,Kind of lame...,"There isn't much interaction to this toy-- mostly just watching lights, music, and spinning gears. There are SO many more interesting toys around."
4,Daughter loves it!,"My daughter received this as a Christmas present and she loves it. She hasn't quite figured out how to put the gears back on just yet though. I don't really care for this product only because it's so hard to keep up with all the pieces, but my daughter loves it and that's what counts!!!"
4,Total hit!,"I bought this for my 1 yr old nephew, and it was an instant hit at this birthday party. The kids swarmed to it and it was played with regularly for the rest of the party. The other reviewers mentioned being disappointed in some aspects, but really - what 1 yr old has a long attention span anyways? - they play with it, move on, come back to it, and repeat! It lights up, moves, makes noise, kids can re-arrange (and stack) gears. Even I thought it was fun to watch. Best part - Hasbro has other 'gear' toys and they all fit. Another Hasbro gear toy was at the party and the kids instantly discovered that the pieces were interchangeable so the gears off the other toy were promptly added to this one. So if you are looking for a gift for a 1 year old, try this one. BTW - Even the 3 yr old was excited to play with it."
5,A must have,"We bought this for our (then) 6 month old daughter, she immediately loved it. She loved how the gears moved, the lights, and that she could press the button again and again. Now that she is one, she loves stacking and moving the gears. It is a great toy that she chooses more often than not to play with. We have bought several other ""gears"" toys and have since mixed all the gears together for even more fun."
4,Fun and keeps them busy,"Although I wish this came with a few more gears to build on with, I think this is great. My 15 month old grandson loves anything electronic, that he can push buttons or flip switches on, so this was perfect! He can easily manipulate/ chnge the gears around himself."
5,Item as described,My granddaughter loves this product. She loves how it spins and loves taking off the gears and putting them back on. She also likes to set small items on the spinning gear and see them go around and around.
3,Gears came off to easily!,I liked the toy until my grandson started playing with it. The gears came off to easily and it was hard toput them back on.
5,Hasbro Playskool Busy Gears,This is a fun toy. My daughter loves removing and placing the gears and then pressing the button to see them turn. She loves the colored lights and music as well.
3,Fun for a month,"My son really liked this toy.. but I should have just kept it in the box. Once he took the gears off the toy he lost all of them. So in the end we were left with a big gear in the middle, and he didn't play with it anymore. I would have liked it better if the gears didn't come off."
3,Entertaining for about 5 minutes. Limited Play Value.,"The kids do like this toy as it is their first gears toy, but there just isn't much they can do with it. You have to keep an on them when they are playing with it because the gears are easily lost, and after about 5 minutes, they are bored with it. Cute idea, but it needs something more. For the money, it's an ok toy for a 2-3 year old."
5,Great toy for your baby- buy it!,"My 8 month old baby loves this toy! She got it for Christmas when she was just 4 months old, but loved it from the get go. The age shows appropriate for 12 months of age, but it has entertained my baby since she first got it. It keeps her interested for a long period of time, removing the gears and chewing on them. She learned right away how to push the button to hear music and get the gears started. I highly recommend this toy for your baby!"
3,Entertains for a Little While...,"I bought this for my 13 month old son many months ago. He seems to enjoy it enough, but it doesn't hold his attention very long. He pushes the buttons a couple times to watch the gears go 'round, then flips it over sending all the gears onto the floor...after that he's finished with it. I don't know if it makes him angry, or he just doesn't like it, but he always seems to be scowling whenever he plays with this.The toy has held up well over the months, but it sure is a pain-in-the-butt having to search his playroom every evening to find the one gear that's missing and probably hiding under the sofa. It doesn't use much power, I've had the same batteries in it since I purchased it. Overall, it really just depends on the child. Mine seems to tolerate it...however I still think it's a neat toy."
1,Not worth it,"This was a gift someone gave my youngest son for his first birthday. It is really loud when the gears run. The gears slip out too easily and are constantly getting lost, which is no fun. It should have included some sort of cover with this toy to keep the pieces together when not in use. I don't feel that this toy had much educational value. We have a gears, gears, gears set for my older boys and THAT is educational and really fun for children of a variety of ages, since the kids can build it to their liking and run by kid power, not batteries. My son played with it for about a wk and then had no interest in it, so it went straight into the donation pile. With three kids, we have enough toys floating around taking up space, this one was not worth keeping and IMO not worth buying."
3,Not a Fan,"This is one of those toys that I wish the kids would just LOSE. They (1yr &3yr olds) don't really play with it, it is REALLY loud, and the pieces don't store well. The toy has to have it's own shelf, b/c you can't stand it on it's side, and you can't put anything on top of it without the sound going off. It looks cute in the package, but I am just not a fan."
4,keeps toddler busy for a few minutes,"My 13-month old loves this toy. He takes out the gears and puts them back and let it spin. I wish it would do a bit more, but my toddler likes it and keeps him busy, and that's all the matters."
4,missed a better price,"good learning toy for colors, shape and motion...shows how this part won't move unless linked with that piece etc. my 13 month old loves the lights and music sounds, too. just disappointed i paid $[...] and it was $[...] the following week. hardly worth hassle for price adjustment - just enough to frustrate me :]"
3,Not as fun as I thought it would be,I bought this as a gift for my nephew last Christmas - he was almost 14 months. He really wasn't all that interested in this toy and the gears got lost very easily.
4,Safe and indeed stackable,"We received this as a gift and I was relieved to determine that the motor is not strong enough to painfully squish any pinched fingers. It'll be interesting to see how long it lasts since the baby often insists on interacting with it while it is in motion. Btw, the gears are stackable but it doesn't stack very well unless the gears are pieced together before placing them on a peg."
3,Cute toy,This is not a bad toy but I can't help but wonder if my almost one year old grandson will tire of this and get bored easily. I think it would go over better if he was younger.
3,It's okay,"My son liked this when it first came, but he quickly grew tired of it. It hasn't gotten a lot of play since the first week it came. It's an okay toy just not that engaging. It might be good for a toy at Grandma's house for novelty... fun for a while and then fun again when it hasn't been seen for a while? I would skip this and spend my money elsewhere if I had it to do over."
2,a disappointment,"This toy is not very interactive. There is nothing to do. The child just pushes the button, so that music plays, lights flash, and the gears go around. The gears are not easily stackable. It did not keep my 1 year old's attention. (He is now 19 months and still not interested.)"
2,Big Disappointment,"I bought this toy last year after reading only great reviews on the amazon site but was not happy when I got it in the mail. Durable? Absolutely. Educational? Sure. But it did not hold my 15 month old son's attention at all! He lost interest after about 30 minutes but enjoyed scattering the gears under tables and across the floor. I finally had to throw it out because he wouldn't go near it except for the minute it took to turn it upside down and drop all the gears all over the place - then he would walk away (not my idea of playing.) If you have an active child, go with the Hoover child-size vacuum instead. Now *that* is a toy that will keep them busy for hours."
1,Dangerous!,"My daughter, 3 years old, was playing with this at a friend's house and her hair got tangled in the gears!Her face got pulled into the board and was screaming while we got it turned off and her hair untangled. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!! IT'S A RECALL WAITING TO HAPPEN!"
2,made in CHINA,"I try VERY hard to buy toys made in the USA. I ordered this and about fell backwards when I looked at the bottom of the box and saw those words I cringe at: MADE IN CHINA.My grandsons (1 and 3 years old) love the gears and the lights. I didn't have to buy batteries (included). But, oh, how I detest the fact that I contributed to the demise of American jobs.I would like to see Amazon add another line on product descriptions to state where an item is made. Buy American, keep jobs here. And give to Toys for Tots and your local food bank or shelter, please!!!"
3,Busy Gears,"My 15 mo old loves this toy. She loves to take the gears off and put them back on and play the music. It is kind of loud though, so a little annoying for the parents, and I don't usually get annoyed by her toys that make sounds. But I still love watching her play with it. I do turn it off sometimes for some relief for myself. But still worth it to watch her enjoy it."
4,Busy Gears,This toy is a big hit with toddlers. All my grandkids loved it. It lights up and the gears move and it can be taken apart and put together. From 8 months to three they all loved it.
4,2 year old really enjoying this toy,"Just received this as a gift for my just-turned 2 year old, and he really likes it. He likes moving the gears around, taking them off & putting them back on, and seems to have fun trying to do it while they're spinning too. Seems like a pretty god toy for him, since it seems to actually hold his interest for more than just a few minutes, and he keeps going back to it."
4,fun interactive play,"This is a fun toy. It lights up and its fun to watch all the gears in motion. My children like to take all the gears out and put them back in. But like many other customers, I have to complain about the gears. They do not stack very well and are extremely easy to loose. Overall a good buy."
4,entertaining,"Keeps baby interested with the lights, music, and movement. Less educational than I would like but overall a fun toy for a 12 month old to play with."
3,It's alright...,It was broken when I received it. I thought it just needed to have the batteries replaced by the time I changed the batteries the packaging had been tossed out so no returning.On the bright side you don't have to have the sound and lights to use the toy (and some parents might prefer it that way). However the gears do come off and can be lost easily.
5,EXCELLENT TOY,"I got the ""Busy Gears"" for my 18 month old granddaughter and my friend got one for her 9 month old grandson. Both of those ages loved this toy. Not only that, but my 4 year old grandson spent the whole time ""helping"" his little sister with it!This toy is well made, keeps the child's interest and still provides a challenge of moving or stacking the gears. It's not one of those toys that a child just has to sit and LOOK at....it is one that a child will keep going back to play with. I highly recommend it!"
3,Daughter Scared,"I am not sure why, but the spinning of the middle wheel and the mechanical sound it makes sends my daughter into tears. She is very afraid of it. She did enjoy walking around with the little gears from it. They fit in the mouth and are an interesting shape."
2,"Gears, gears everywhere!","When other reviewers talked about its portability, it led me to assume the gears were more stable. I gave one to my grandson yesterday, and within the hour, one of the gears was missing. As soon as he'd pick it up, all the gears fell off. I was chasing parts most of the day. If I find the missing gear, I shall return this toy.It also doesn't come with batteries, and requires a small screw driver to install them. Cole was more intrigued by trying to unscrew the battery case than he was with the actual toy.This toy made me rethink the other presents I bought for his upcoming 2nd birthday that have multiple parts.Lakeshore Learning carries the type of gears used in the ""Brainy Baby"" DVD's, but they're for 3 and up. I suggesting waiting a year and getting their magnetic ones.Now, I'm trying to find some type of container to store his Playskool Busy Gears in, or what will be left of them, by the time I find something today:-)"
3,DO NOT BUY!,"Bought this toy for my son. He gummed the bottom (as teething babies do). Later when I picked up the toy to put it away I realized the paint had all come off from the part he put his mouth on. It is common knowledge babies gum their toys, it's what they do! Paint is not supposed to come off easily like that. It is all white space where the plastic was blue. The best part? it says MADE IN CHINA! Wonderful. This tells me my baby could have possibly ingested some kind of toxin like lead???????? Disappointed and appalled that this is still happening in 2012.I am now watching my son and praying there is no adverse reaction. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!"
4,Great Toy for kid but rough for Mom who like neat,"Purchased this toy for 1 yr old nephew who loves it but organizes the gears into other locations (toilet, floor, etc). Great toy for kids but if the parent(s) is into neat, look for something else."
1,regret buying it,"First of all, my son is scared of this toy. Normally I wouldn't blame the toy for that - as every kid is different and it's impossible to find a toy that every kid loves. But this toy is annoying even to me! The lights and sounds are ok, but then when the gears start to spin, they are too loud! It's distractingly, annoyingly, obnoxiously loud - not appealing at all. That's the part where my son gets scared, and I just want to turn the thing off when they spin.Second, it has a handle to carry it around. Sounds convenient - however the pieces are loose. So when you lift it to carry, all the pieces fall!..haha who designed this thing?!Also, those two things aside, I don't know why they made all the pieces the same. Wouldn't it be a more interesting system if all the gears were in different sizes and they could be rearranged to create different gear mechanisms? Right now it's just pointless to reaarrange them.Good thing I bought it when it was hugely discounted."
3,"Loud, gears fall off","I'm surprised I didn't read any reviews about how LOUD this toy is once the ""motor"" kicks in to start the gears turning. My 9 month old was happily listening to the music and watching it light up, and then suddenly.... ""WWWWHHHIIRRRRLLLLL!!!!"" He was frightened and cried, but he normally isn't scared of anything. He cried every time the gears started turning around, so I had to turn it to off. Also, I thought I might hang this toy on the wall by the changing table, but I didn't realize the gears just fall off, I thought they were attached or there was a clear cover over it, but they only stay on by gravity if the toy is laying down on the floor. Too bad. He does like playing/chewing on the gears, but yes the gears end up all over the house and one is missing already. My preschooler likes putting the gears back on it though.Hopefully when he's older, he might enjoy watching the gears turn around and not be scared of the sound."
2,Not for Children,"We don't need to see the Little Mermaid's nipples.(I can never understand why the people who cry out that the nudity is ""JUST art!"" don't notice that it is never underdressed males, but little girls that we have to look at.)Amazon.com rates this book for ages 4 - 8, but the text is difficult and violent, and the admittedly lovely art is appropriate for graphic novels in the _Sandman_ vein, not for kids.Yes, it is a lovely story, yes, it was dark to begin with, and no it is not a children's book.Good translation, pretty (aside from the gratuitousness) illustrations earn 2 stars."
1,3rd one,have installed 3 and still have the same problem with this one. Now I need to look for another one
5,AC Delco parts are GM approved OEM replacement parts,Bought this to fix an intermittent squeal coming from belt area during cold or wet weather. AC Delco parts are GM approved OEM replacement parts.
1,who's gonna pay...for this thing?,"Seriously, [the] price tag for a new CD from a total has-been hip hop producer (who was at best a primo rip-off) is outrageous! I've heard the lead off singles (which by the way are already 2 years old!) and they are weak!; lame meaningless lyrics and beats circa 1997."
4,You'll be pleasantly surprised,"Michael Rappaport's performance alone makes this a must see. The movie has a good, rapid pace, filled with numerous cast of characters (even the dog) that give the film a funny, irreverent essence. It trails off somewhat in the end, but overall, a very funny movie that doesn't take itself too seriously."
2,"Worth watching, once.","It wasn't all that bad, but then again it wasn't too good either. James Woods wasn't in that much of it but still made up some of the best parts. The funniest parts are still with the ""beer wars"". But in short, you can watch it, but don't buy it."
3,Woods is wacky!!,"I liked it. woods was wacky as Corrigans uncle and it was funny to see Woods get hit y that bus at the end, hilarious. Michael Rapaport is absolutely awesome in this too. funny part is when Corrigans in Rapaports place with his girlfriend and his girlfriend is telling about how she raided some place that had a bunch of vibrators"
1,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for the ""old"" guitar version on Malaguena that I have heard several times before. I didn't recognize this version."
2,Manufacturo,"Substituting the cello for a synthesiser wasn't a good move. The feeling is gone from this album; it lacks the sincerity of the band's previous melancholic recordings. Prior to hearing this album I had a longing ambition to see Madredeus live on stage, but if the songs and instrumentation of this album are any indication, the band urgently needs to regroup. Frankly, Pedro Ayres Magalhaes, the main man when it comes to the writing of the songs, seems to have become an old fart. Even elevators wouldn't move to this stuff."
5,MAGICAL,"I am Portuguese, aged 29 and was only 14 years old when Madredeus appeared as a musical group.Since then, I have been following closely their carreer.After so many years, seeing how they became better and better, listening to their records and going to so many concerts, I can only say that this group has changed my life.Their music is truly magical... For us, here in Portugal, it's with great emotion that we see the success they have achieved both here and abroad.The last album ""Movimento"" is almost a review of all those years behind and how the future should be: with peace, love and faith.Madredeus make me feel hopeful and fight for a better future for us all: that is the message of Movimento.And that is true magic: being able to express in words and through a magnificent voice what we all feel and hope."
5,Wonderful!,"Magic, wonderful, sweet. 16 heart-breaking songs. Teresa Salgueiro is an angel. What could I say more? Liste to it..."
