2,Not Very Practical,"While it does give mouth watering descriptions of dishes served at historic restaraunts, it entices the reader to want to dine at them and not cook. Most of the recipes call for portions that would feed a barracks. While this is certainly understandable for the eateries mentioned in the cookbook, it makes for frustrating conversions into family size portions for the home kitchen.However, most of the chili recipes can be frozen and are the best you will come across. Not to mention the pies are sinfully good! Ultimately best used as an interesting bit pop-culture history and not as functional cookbook."
5,Every Photo A Masterpiece,"Inspiring. Emotive. Creative. Colorful. Each picture is ""poster"" material, quite unusual for table-top photography books. With wonderful essays, it provides an interesting reading. I pick it up often to look at a few pictures and be inspired about the world.Cheers, BilFish"
5,A whole new perspective.,"This is a remarkable work. We're all accustomed to wildlife shots, but not from this point of view. Firstly, all in their true natural habitat, not some preserve or other artificial locale, and secondly, most shots are from a very intimate perspective. Not telephoto lenses, but wide angle. The colors, framing, and perspectives are unlike any you've seen or are likely to see again. Can't recommend this book enough."
4,This is just an FYI.,"From time to time in sets and collection, people want to know what is in the set, so here goes...1. His Girl Friday, 2. Penny Serenade, 3. The Man with the Golden Arm, 4. The Last Time I Saw Paris, 5. A Farewell To Arms, 6. Road To Bali, 7. Our Town, 8. Life with Father, 9. Love Affair, 10. A Star is Born, 11. Of Human Bondage, 12. My Man Godfrey"
3,Cool Band Of Girls Unafraid Of Their Own Sexuality,"I bought this album on Amazon after listening to a track on Adam Curry's ""Daily Source Code"" www.dailysourcecode.com I thought it was so cool that I bought the whole album. Don't regret it a bit. It's got a lot of cool tracks on it and lyrics that make you laugh out loud at times.I don't like most of what I hear on the radio these days, so it's nice to hear music like this being released by little known bands that you actually enjoy rather than the crap the music industry pushes down our throats via the corporate controlled (formerly public) airwaves.3 stars because you have to really be into this kind of music to enjoy it, but I do consider it fun and by purchasing this CD you're allowing these girls to go on and do more of what they do best (I'm assuming) make music."
4,cool,provides a great barrier between the heat of a laptop and your lap while providing a comfortable and stable base
5,Great product!,Great product! Ima gamer and it keeps my laptop nice and cool. Highly recommend this to anyone whose concerned about overheating.
3,mediocre,"I guess I was expecting a little more for $26. It keeps the heat off my legs, and I don't have to worry about my blankets blocking the fans, but the two rest supports on the bottom are kind of hard for putting directly on your legs. It also seems a bit flimsy, and is already somewhat bowed upwards. Disappointing as this was purchased as a gift. Works alright, but not gift material."
2,"Blocks the heat, but my laptop still overheats","Although this lap desk blocks the heat, my laptop still overheats. I wish the design had something to keep the laptop from sitting directly down on the surface. Also the surface is slick and I have a hard time keeping my laptop from sliding around. If I had it to do over, I would try the Xpad instead."
3,Lapinator Plus,The Lapinator plus was a bit disappointing. The surface is a bit too slick and the laptop slides around. I would use a little different surfacing.
1,Sent mine back,"I bought one of these Lapinators because of the claims that it keeps your laptop cooler and better ventilated. I had had occasional problems with my laptop overheating in the past (I have a Toshiba Satellite) and thought this would solve the problem. Well, instead it had the opposite effect, in that every time I placed my laptop on the Lapinator, within minutes my laptop would overheat and crash. So I sent the thing back, even though it took over an hour of my time plus the expense of additional postage (and no refund on the original shipping fees), mainly so I could be free of a guilty conscience by not adding more non-biodegradable plastic to the landfills. Save your money, your time and the landfills by buying something else."
1,Lapinator Plus,I'm not very impressed with this item. Heat from laptop is felt though lapinator making it uncomfortable to use as designed. Not worth the money.
3,Disappointment,"I purchased a 17 inch laptop to work on and found my old reliable lap cooler did not work with the rounded front of my new HP. The search was on to find a replacement. After researching I settled on the Lapinator. It does what it says; it blocks the heat. However, the stick on risers do not lift the laptop to a comfortable position for typing. The small amount of rise is barely noticeable from a flat surface. It does accommodate my laptop, but I wish I had paid more money for an item that had experienced typists in mind. I also found this item a tad too large for my brief case. In order to fit in my case the sides of the Lapinator have to curl slightly. I wonder why they do not work with the major manufacturers of laptop carriers when they design. It now resides under my bed and I am purchasing a more expensive lap protector."
5,Greatest thing since sliced bread!,"I just began using my Lapinator and am so pleased I had to write a review! I have been looking for something to make my laptop computing experience more comfortable and safer for my machine. I have looked at hundreds of cooling pads, chill mats, and various other accessories on numerous websites and none of them fit my needs. Most seemed designed to be used on a desk surface and none provided the combination of comfort and cooling I needed. (I actually use my laptop on my lap, not my desk. Go figure!) The Lapinator, on the other hand, perfectly meets my needs. It keeps my machine and my legs cooler and provides a comfy, padded surface to cushion my legs from the weight of my laptop. I am so pleased with this product! For laptop users like me, it's the greatest thing since sliced bread! (As an added bonus, the folks at Lapinator are very pleasant!)"
3,Okay. Not bad. Not great.,"Gives you a flat service to put your laptop on while sitting in your favorite chair - as I am right now. The pads are fairlly comfortable, but as another reviewer noted, after a while, the heat from my laptop finds its way through the insulation and to my legs. Cooler than not using anything, but not cool. It's lightweight, which is good, but perhaps the tradeoff in making it very light also reduces its ability to dissipate heat. For what it is, it's probably a bit overpriced, but what isn't? Anyway, all that said, I still would buy it again. It works long enough for me - I don't use it for hours at a time. If you do sit for hours with your notebook PC on your lap, might want to consider something else."
2,Don't know if its my computer or the lapinator...,"Since I've had the lapinator I've had problems with my laptop overheating. I can't say for sure it's this products fault but it makes me wonder if the heat is blocks is being reflected back into the bottom mounted fans on my laptop.As for the coolness factor. It does keep you cooler but to me its still hot...especially to the touch. If I touch the lapinator where the fans are on the laptop it is red hot.I think this is a fine product if you have a run of the mill laptop, but mine is a 17"" graphics intensive unit and overheating has become a terrible problem since using this product.Bottom Line: It works, not as great as I had hoped, and it may be causing me more problems than it is solving."
3,comfy but hot,this is a very comfortable devise but it does not keep your lap top cool enough. it is a trade off.
3,Its ok,I like the product but it does not really cool off the laptop as much as I thougt it would is very comfy to use.
3,It works,"The Lapinator performs as advertised, but there's not much to it. This product could be sold for $10.00 and the manufacturer still would have made a tidy profit. When you receive this thing, you'll realize you could easily create the same product from odds and ends found around the house. I recommend looking for something cheaper on the market. I'm absolutely sure another company could manufacture this same product and undercut the price of the Lapinator."
1,Save yourself the hassle of returning the thing at your own expense,"I bought one of these Lapinators because of the claims that it keeps your laptop cooler and better ventilated. I had had occasional problems with my laptop overheating in the past (I have a Toshiba Satellite) and thought this would solve the problem. Well, instead it had the opposite effect, in that every time I placed my laptop on the Lapinator, within minutes my laptop would overheat and crash. So I sent the thing back, even though it took over an hour of my time plus the expense of additional postage (and no refund on the original shipping fees), mainly so I could be free of a guilty conscience by not adding more non-biodegradable plastic to the landfills. Save your money, your time and the landfills by buying something else."
4,Indispensible,The only problem: I tried to figure how you could make the label harder to remove from the surface and came up with nothing.
4,If you have a Powerbook...,"Or other widescreen laptop computer, or even just want some extra mouse-space, this lap desk is a fantastic choice. It even comes with rubber feet to help elevate your laptop for cooling, if the feet on your machine aren't doing the job. This also helps keep the machine from sliding at all on the smooth surface of the lap desk.Having looked for a lap desk as a gift for my room mate I wanted something, lightweight and portable but large enough to be functional and over all to be comfortable. The Lapinator Plus was all that, and then some. Eventually, I'm going to get one for myself."
3,Lapinator plus,"I have mixed feelings about this product. Yes it is very light weight, but seems a bit flimsy as well. I've been using it for about a month now. While it does help to raise up my laptop so the fans can work properly (the fans are on the bottom of my laptop) and significantly reduces the heat on my legs when I use it, the portion that sits directly on my legs is beginning to give and bend as it is not well made or sturdy. My laptop is rather heavy. It might be better suited for a light weight laptop but it doesn't seem that it will last very long for a heavy one. I haven't used any other laptop pad so I haven nothing to compare it to. Overall, I would not purchase this item again for this particular laptop."
5,Works wonderfully.,Works great as advertised. Completely passive. Three bumpers is fine. Temperature drop in speedfan shows 28c to 10c less on average based on different types of activity.
2,Not like in picture,Bought item to us on lap like in picture not even close to size in picture. The lapdesk is not wide enuff to have a mouse on it. Barley big enuff for computer not to happy with size or quality will be sending back...UNHAPPY CUSTOMER.
4,Computer Helper,"I have purchased a total of 3 of these(for 3 different people). I had been using a small board to rest the computer on my legs, but it eventially got uncomfortable. I had to get the computer off my legs because the cooling vent rested right on my leg, cutting off the ventilation. This ""board"" is comfortable, with 2 strands of foam insulation running accross your legs and the top is fairly rigid, giving the computer a good base to rest on. Cost is a little high, but it's holding up good and beats the home made fix I had. It came with 3 stick-on feet, which I put on the computer. That way, you don't have to worry about lining up the computer with the feet each time if you had put them on the ""desk""."
3,Not garanteed to be complete.,Received my factory re certified nailer today only to find out that the 1000 included nails were not included and that the oil bottle had less then 40% left in it. The gun has very minor paint marring but was unable to test functionality due to lack of the included items.I expect a lot more from a factory reconditioned tool. Checking that the packaging included nails and possibly repainting would not have been that difficult on bostitch's part.Disappointed. I personally suggest buying new products instead of taking the Bostitch gamble.
5,Extraordinary!,This work reveals an extraordinary approach that shows us the simple ways to always stand out from the crowd.
1,This book was awful.,"We got this book from a library (I'm glad we didn't pay for it), and found it to be a total waste of time. The author relentlessly repeats the same message over and over, rephrasing it just enough times to fill up a book. The thesis of the book, that performing the job function during the interview is the best way to win a job, is realistic for very few fields. Typical of headhunters, the author has a very loose grasp on how to assess the skills required to perform a job well, so has latched onto a ""recipie"" that has worked for him in the past. This type of headhunter has little more than hype to offer employers and job candidates. Be careful of following this person's advice, or his suggestions may taint the interviewer's impression of you. Rely on your own skills and experience, not on this guy. If you have neither skills nor experience, following the advice in this book will make you look like a fool."
4,ASK THE HEADHUNTER,"You really can be your own executive search firm. Absolutely an EXCELLENT source of ""how to"" when it comes to looking for a career. Even though it was written in 1997 and some of the material is very dated (think internet), it is still a ""go to"" source for me. If you can get your hands on one of these books and then diligently follow the process it outlines, your chances of finding the position you are looking for is just as good as if you were working with a search firm - without going through the hassle of vetting search firms. And if you don't believe me - then take it from the person who referred me to this tool - an HR recruitment professional."
4,Nice book but had to adapt it to market,"I'm from Latin America, and had to adapt this book to my local market. However it is a great book. It brings you much insight about the hiring process and it is a motivational book also.If you are proactive and want to land a new job, this book is the one for you."
3,Good advice/ Very repetitive,"Don't ""do the interview,"" ""do the job in the interview.""Excellent advice as is advice about trying to skirt HR and getting to the hiring manager (something anyone who has been in the corporate world should already be clued into.)Still - this is one of the most repetitive books I have ever read. The two pieces of advice noted herein are repeated in every imaginable way throughout the book - again and again and again.Worth a gander and contains useful advice but don't feel you need to read the entire book to get the gist."
2,Federal fine but state won't efile,Bought the Federal + State + Efile and everything worked great until I tried to file my state return. I repeatedly received error messages and called Customer Service who couldn't explain the error and would not give me a refund for my state efile charges.
1,I can't believe that you'd sell this,"In December 2007 I bought this assuming that it was for the current tax year. When I got it I realized it was for the previous tax season and returned it. Why would this still be for sale on the website, especially at full price. Ridiculous."
1,TaxCut Made Mistake on State Taxes,Missouri state tax auditor caught a mistake that TaxCut made on my state taxes relating to the tax deduction for college tuition 529 program. This cost me $450. I'm switching back to TurboTax.
2,Caused Greif,Did not transfer information from last years taxes accurately. When I e-filed IRS rejected. Had to go back and manually put in correct information. Next year back to TurboTax.Ken
2,No support for ESPP or ISO,"I thought the product was fine until I tried to enter my ESPP and ISO sale info .. it asked about the grant and sale dates, but nothing about how many shares I sold or the price per share, didn't guide me through reconciling my 1099-B from these sales to what shows up on my W-2, etc. Worthless. Back to TurboTax for two times the price to get it done right."
5,Doing Taxes for me and a friend,"I placed an order for H&R Tax-Cut this Januarary and boy was I pleased. Not only did I complete my families taxes, both Federal and State, but a friend at work wanted me to do his as well. Using the E-File option for our return was easy and had the refund in my bank account within days after completing the returns."
1,Can't I go lower than 1 star????,"Easy to use. Simple to follow. Informative.however, the entire file that held my taxes became corrupt and I can't open, print, save, or view my taxes that I SPENT HOURS creating. Thankfully, I was able to actually file but now I have to pay the fed gov $39 to get a photocopy of my fed taxes (haven't even asked about state, yet) and then try to recreate my taxes for my own record keeping.Their customer service reps were lacking basic customer service training and even though I was a 7 year TaxCut user, will NEVER buy the product again or recommend anyone else use it. Their customer service was rude, unhelpful, and they offered absolutely no consolation whatsoever. I do not believe I could be more disappointed in a company's customer service department."
4,Turbo Tax is easier to use / Taxcut is much cheaper,"No brand loyalty...This year I chose Taxcut. Independent product reviewers said it was just as capable as Turbo Tax. The decision boiled down to a choice between: Turbo Tax is easier to use / Taxcut is much cheaper.I didn't have any difficulties with the Taxcut software, although I did have to drop my firewall protection to update the software and again when I wanted to efile. I'm not sure why my firewall software (Norton Internet Security) didn't ask me to grant Taxcut access to the internet.--Pagole"
1,missing state form,I bought premium with efile. I cannot efile because of unsupported form. Never had this problem with turbo tax. The process of getting a refund is not much fun either.
2,"Bad Service, Bad Software","I've been using TaxCut for 5 years, and will never use it again. This year it failed to calculate how much of my state refund from 2005 should be declared as income. Customer support said ""call the IRS"" (after wasting 20 min). I tried the ""Ask a Tax Question"" service. A person called back in 10 min, said that she couldn't help me, and said that I would be ""put back in the queue"". No one ever called back (it's been 10 days). There is no customer service number for ""Ask a Tax Question"" and no one in regular customer service wanted to help. Last year, the sofware made an error which led to a refund of the sales price. Not possible this year because without the box, there are no refunds."
5,Tax Cut review,I was very pleased with the speed in which my order was processed and shipped to my home I was able to quiclky file my retuns electronically and got a speedy return fro the IRS.
4,A Good Tax Software Program,"After several years of development, this program provides a thorough and well thought out guide through the complex maize of tax laws.What more would you want in order to make tax preparation an ordered and somewhat painless process.The only thing I would add is a way to e-file tax forms to more than one state."
4,Tax Cut still shows love for Windows 98,"I did try to get Turbo Tax this year like the last 3 years but this year it won't work with Windows 98. I tried Tax Cut since it still lists that as an option and it did very well for me even with my old system. Had no problems carrying over the Turbo Tax data. I will confess I have a simple return-single, no dependents, 1 source of income, some charitable donations so I don't know how it would have done with a more complicated return. I e-filed and returns were accepted with Federal and State with no problems within 24 hours. Yes...my return this year will be going towards a new computer :)"
2,You get what you pay for....unfortunately,"I have been using TurboTax for many years, but I want to save some money this year so I bought TaxCut instead. The interface is good and it seemed to work well, right up to the point where I realized that I can't enter my ESPP transactions. I can't believe that the Premium edition doesn't come with this support. There are probably more people with ESPP stock than rental property, yet it is not supported by their top of the line product. Now I have lost the afternoon and have the hassle of the return.Going back to TurboTax and its big price tag."
1,Not again -,"I ended up throwing it away and using Turbo Tax Online - much simpler, faster, and thorough."
3,Software is average and extras cost more,"The software was average in use (but I am a little spoiled by Apple); I got lost a few times trying to navigate when trying to file an extension: the software did not seem to realize that I already prepared my taxes. After I figured that out, they charged me to file the extension. I do not recall having to pay for that with TurboTax last year."
5,"""Is in there""","Everything I need to file my Fed and State taxes. I did not expect the Deduction pro to be included; pleasely surprised. I have used Taxcut for a few years now. I like the import of previous year tax data (less typing).It seems H&R; has an online version. It would be nice if their online version can import data from my purchased version. Oh well, maybe next year."
1,Very bad customer service,"They still haven't fixed the error where electronic filing in California is disallowed due to incorrect address length calculation.Customer service of the company that makes this product is very bad. Customer service representatives are not knowledgeable and unwilling to help. This is why I am rating this product so low.[3/19/2007] I feel obligated to post this update: I was contacted by an H&R; Block representative, and was assured that the problem I reported will be fixed for next year.Apparently, this problem affects California state return e-filers whose address is between 25 and 30 characters."
2,Very Buggy Software,"I have used Taxcut and TurboTax on and off for years. TurboTax tends to have less problems. This year Taxcut was incredibly difficult. First it would not properly import the data from DeductionPro. Then the tier one tech support gave me outright incorrect information. Finally tier two support gave me the link to the custom patch that allowed me to import the data. Also, when I received the Taxcut email that the IRS had accepted my return I logged on to Taxcut to check status and get my declaration control number. Taxcut would not recognize that I had efiled and would not check for the dcn. I had to call support for about the 5th time and after some time on the phone they discovered they could access the dcn and gave it to me over the phone. Because of these delays I have still not finished with the state return. I don't know if I will buy this product again."
1,Don't do it!,"I've used Taxcut for the past couple of years, but this year it's a giant headache. After I submitted my return, I went back to check the status. The software told me I had not submitted my return and wanted me to submit again. Worse is that I got an email saying my return was rejected by the IRS and I need to check the status in TaxCut. Well, how am I supposed to do that if TaxCut doesn't even think I've submitted yet. So, I went ahead and submitted again and I still have the same problem. TaxCut still thinks I haven't submitted. 3 calls to Tech Support and waiting on hold for an hour hasn't resolved squat. My next call is to ask for a refund with which I'll switch back to TurboTax."
1,Next year I'm back to Turbo Tax!!,"I am self-employed, so my taxes are a little more involved and I have to fill out extra forms.Last year I tried to save some money and do it myself with Turbo Tax.It was fast, easy, straight forward.This year I thought I'd save a little more and try Tax Cut. I mean how different can software be? And, H & R block did my taxes for years. They are a tax company, after all.Wrong!!!It took me days, compared to Turbo that took lest than an hour.It was confusing and annoying.To top it off, I paid the state tax it said I owed. Only to be told by the state my taxes were wrong, ...... And, they owed ME twice as much!!!Yeesh!!Next year I won't skimp, and I'll go back to Turbo."
4,Easier to Use than Turbo Tax,"I have always used Turbo Tax but last year it was too frustrating and the last couple years the commercials were not wanted when I was trying to get the taxes done.Based on reviews online I went with Taxcut this year. I did have some problems with it and luckily I always do my own taxes so I knew something was wrong (it let me deduct mortage interest from my rental home and also mortage interest from my home --which is the same thing in my case.) I am military so I am a little different.It also has a hard time recognizing how joint filers can be permanent residents of two different states. Again, my unique situation and I got it to work.All in all, I was very happy."
2,Too much advertising,I disliked the fact that they only offer advise with their products only. I would like general ideas. The layout is much better than previous years.
2,Value for your money,"Does what you expect it to. Here's what I found:- e-Filing hitch - for CA State, it said that since I had annualized my income, it could not e-File - this is at the very last step. Does'nt seem right - more likely, they decided to leave out this functionality. Even when I changed that it seemed to not recognize I changed it.. and eventually had to save it and exit and reopen the software to understand the change. It needs to warn you of e-Filing issues a little sooner in the process.- its unable to download brokerage trades (TurboTax does that), however, Turbotax did'nt do a good job matching trades, so this does not seem too bad of a con. I was able to import around 200 trades in .txf format into TaxCut without any problem.- I liked the final error review - it caught a dependent care deduction and a couple of stock trades.All in all - value for money. I will be sticking to TaxCut for 2007 taxes. I don't like how Intuit has increased their prices.."
5,Cute and protective,I bought this cd case for my daughter. She LOVES it because it's so cute. I LOVE it because it protects her cds. Seems really sturdy too.
5,Great Product,This CD/DVD case is wonderful. It has good stitching and the zippers are heavy duty. I bought this case for my wife and she loves it because its not the everyday looking case. The CD/DVD sleeves are simple making it easy to install/remove disks.
1,Kurt Warner: And The First Shall Be Last,"I'm a big Kurt Warner fan, both as a football player and a peron. However, this book is almost degrading to him. Although everyone quoted speaks highly of Kurt, the author's presentation is extremely poor. It reads like he taped interviews and transcribed them word for word into a book. Very boring."
1,Weak effort. No Super Bowl for this book.,"I am a huge Kurt Warner fan. However, this book was terrible. It seemed that it was thrown together so it could get to market quick. I wouldn't want anyone to waste their time with this. I normally don't try to trash items that people put a lot of work into. However, I don't feel there was lot of work put into this project. The book consists of stories/letters from people that knew him. Most stories are disjointed at best. Sorry Kurt. Just don't feel this book is worthy of your achievements."
4,Can be hard to unscrew...,"This lens seems to be good construction quality and works as expected. One word of caution: the ring used to attach this filter to your lens is VERY THIN. It is hard to unscrew the filter if you put it on too tight, so be careful. Once i realized this (aka after the first time, which it was stuck on the lens for a lonnnng time) I haven't had a problem."
2,Hoya - not what it used to be,"Polarizer filters have two rings. One ring has threads that screw into the lens. I did not screw the filter in very tight, just firm enough so that I could rotate, the second outer ring without unscrewing the filter. The filter worked fine and removed the reflections I wanted to get rid off. Removing the filter was the problem. The ring with the threads is only about 1 mm wide and thus difficult to get a good grip on. I used a rubber band to get a better grip and struggled for quite some time to get the filter off the lens. I never had this problem with my 20+ year old 52mm Hoya polarizer. The ring with the threads is 3mm wide in the old filter which makes a big difference. This detail is missing from the product description."
5,A historical page turner,I have read all of Karen Robards' books and of her historical romances Desire in the Sun is the cream of the crop. The characters are believeable and react to problems appropretly. Leila is young and she acts like a young woman without the benifit of worldly experience. Joss is one of Robards best male characters he has a reason to hate Leila but he still has the capacity to love her.
4,I fell in love with the characters and their passion,This was the first Karen Robards book I read. I loved it. I fell in love with the characters and their need for one another. I would recommend this to anyone. I read it in 3 days. I just didn't want to put it down.
3,"Good, but problematic for me... (really 2.5)","This is the kind of romance novel which, for me, is just good enough to keep me reading, but, I don't feel that I want to read it again and again, the way I do with my keepers.I thought there could have been more depth given to these characters and to their situation. The hero, Joss's having African-American blood was a BIG deal in those days, after all. I thought that discovery of this fact was too clumsily rushed into. Then, BOOM, his grandfather dies - too suddenly - though it certainly moved the plot right along. But WAY too fast.In fact, the whole book felt rushed. The author rushes into the revelation about Joss, then rushed him into slavehood; rushed into a shipwreck; rushed the hero & heroine into making love... I guess I wanted more sexual tension, more suspense. It was an OK read but not as great as it could have been. I thought the hero's heritage was a great plot twist, but it's just not used wisely enough."
4,Tammy's Last Great Solo Project,"In her liner notes and acknowledgements Tammy says ""I think this is my best album ever."" She also credits Bob Montgomery with finding ""the best collection of songs"" she ever had on an album. These are definitely over-statements. The work cannot begin to compare to her collaborations with Billy Sherrill. But the production is good and most of the songs are high quality. But it is definitely NOT the best album she ever put out or the collection of songs the best she ever had on an album. She probably wanted that to be the case because by then, music by artists of her generation was no longer welcome in Nashville. Its a shame because the more one listens to this the better it becomes. And it certainly beats anything put out by ""Faith"", ""Martina"", ""Carrie Underwood"", ""Reba"" or any other Tammy wannabes out there. I'll put this up against anything by today's artists."
1,Doesn't work,I bought this to test the alkalinity of my water. I could have just used some red food coloring instead.
3,5 great songs,"Purchased via Amazon. This CD is good in what it provides, but it is only 5 songs and I should have read the total description better as I was thinking there would be more. So for me, this purchase was just alright."
3,I liked it but a part was broken,"I really liked the Lion's Head Soup Tureen set, It was for a gift, I received it on time, but the ladle was broken. I sent an e-mail the same day that I recieved the tureen with some pictures of the broken ladle, next day I received an e-mail saying that there was no problem that they would send me another ladle but that was the last thing I heard from them (dec 12, 08), It's been more than two months (feb 13, 09) and they haven't replaced it. I would really like to get another ladle specially since this was for a gift, In fact I was going to get another set for myself but I am waiting to hear from them.This is the first time that I have a problem buying from amazon."
3,"Music excellent, publishing execution wretched","I don't understand what is so difficult about distinguishing between disc 1 and disc 2; Gimell seems to frequently have problems with this concept, creating issues for those of us who rip to the library in Windows media player.Nevertheless, the performers are excellent; would that the publisher would match their level of expertise."
4,Good Read With a Twist.,Fast paced read with a twist of an ending....Really enjoyed the book with political implications that are reflected in today's headlines.The story is engaging and I like an ending that is not predictable. Characters are complete with a tinge of reality that is refreshing. Would recommend this book to any sci-fi fan.
4,Prescient sci-fi,"I read IMMUNE about two years ago, and I enjoyed it. I thought it full of new ideas and new ways of looking at things and that is one of science fiction's most important functions I think. However, recent events suggest something else this book does. Sometimes, though not often, Science fiction warns about a seemingly far-fetched future evil that subsequently emerges as a real possibility. I am thinking in particular of the fate suffered by the Arabs in this book in face of the expansion of Israel Chryl Gray describes. Recent events in the Middle East and our very own ""Presider's"" strange animus toward Syria (last reiterated a few days ago) give me pause. Is a ""Greater Israel"" part of the overall plan for controlling that region and its oil."
2,Innoculate yourselves,"I had such high hopes for this book, but between the poor editing, the scads of typos and simple grammatical errors, and the thin story, I had to say I was really let down. After reading it, I felt unsatisfied and wondered what exactly the author's point was. Was this supposed to be a postmodern Stepford Wives or a straightforward action-adventure book? I also wondered about portraying Yates as a vengeful gay man, whether there was some unconscious homophobia going on. While I probably agree with the author's politics for the most part, as a reader looking for a pleasant literary experience, I couldn't really get past its flaws. All in all, a disappointing read."
5,Witty and warm,"There are at least two kinds of fantasy writing -- one where the author takes the ""pritee"" and ""bedamned"" stuff seriously, and the kind where the author is wry and funny. This book is about a demon who slowly realizes humans are pretty cool. Of course, that's not PC demon belief. There's a love story here and wit."
4,ICe in me,"Kids...what can i say, buy this. Its fantastic what sounds a couple of dudes on bass can make. I also recommend godheadsilo...any albumn, but share the fantasy is my favorite. Its great to hear how one bass player and one drummer can make such an awesome sound. Thats my story and i'm stickin to it. Buy godhead silo before you buy this though."
2,"I wouldn't call this exactly ""essential.""","I would have liked to see some bigger 80s hits. Some seemed a bit obscure. Maybe if they had picked songs that were on the top of the charts for each year in the 80s, the collection would have been a bit more ""essential."""
5,i love these bad boys,the style is so badazzi always get complimentsand they are great qualitythey just get real dirty but its all good!highly recommended
5,Love Sanuk!,"This is my second pair of Sanuk sandals, and I love them as much as the first pair. Quality is excellent, fit and comfort top-notch and they seem to last and last ... Can't recommend them highly enough ..."
4,Great Flop!,Love the width and cusion....lol. Just wish the material didnt wear down so fast...I have bought several different colors of the beer cozy over the past few years.
2,Little rips in the top keep peeling,"These were nice and comfy, except a little break in the surface kept irritating the bottom of my foot. When you peel off the part sticking up, then walk it rips more, and basically every time I wear these there's a bump sticking into my right foot that is very irritating."
3,Ok Sandal,"Comfort is amazing on these sandals, however there are a couple of issues I have with them.They leave black streak marks on my laminate floors. I stopped wearing them indoors because of this. Happened often enough where i got tired of getting down and scrubbing the black marks away with wet paper towels. Am I the only one experiencing this?Also, they absorb way too much water. I thought they could be a good pool/shower sandal but they are pretty much sponges on your feet! yuck, I have to let them dry out before wearing them again. Now I use my Local sandals from Hawaii for wet outings."
5,The comfiest flip-flops I have ever had the pleasure of owning,"These flip-flops are ridiculously comfortable. The material that they are made from is a very thick yoga mat material, and they are extremely soft and cushioned for walking. This has really made them my immediate favorite flip-flops, and all of my other ones now feel awful and uncomfortable by comparison.They do struggle with getting them wet, however, and once you do you will find that they are unpleasantly squishy for a while until they dry out. Not a big deal if you wear them around, but they would not be as good to wear to a pool. But, just wear some cheap ones to the pool and use these when you do anything else."
5,Comfy flip flop,"These are very comfortable. I usually need something with arch support, but these are like memory foam and I've been just fine. I was concerned the thick upper band would be too hot, but it is also very comfortable. It feels like slippers. I highly recommend."
5,Great flip flops,My husband loves these. This is his second pair. Very comfy and hold up a long time. They do take a while to dry if they get wet though.
4,Cushy but supportive,I was so excited to find these on Amazon as my old pair were falling apart after 3 years. I love them. They mold to your feet and yet have a layer of very firm support in the heel and arch. I've also not had a problem with breaking in the thong part which is usually an issue for me.
5,The MOST comfortable flip flops you will ever wear,I absolutely love these flip flops. They are so soft. They are very light-weight as well. I will never buy another brand ever again. Highly recommended.
1,Too soft & not good for around water...,"Really wanted to like these flip-flops, as they are as comfortable as can be just standing in them. But the day after wearing for an extended period, the bottom of my foot hurt. After recovery, I tried again with the same result. No more for me - off they go to the thrift store.Also, due to the cushy foam layer, I would not recommend using near or in water - they act like a sponge and dry in about the same length of time. No fun walking around on a wet sponge..."
1,Don't buy these flip flops,"when I purchased them , they were comfortable and thought I had made a good purchase but within two weeks the bottoms seperated and have rendered them unusable...peeling from the toe back..too bad..so cost me 10 bucks a week to wear them"
4,Good when new,"Unlike with many thinner and harder flops, I can walk all day in these. As others pointed out, buy 1 size larger (i.e., buy a 10 if you normally wear 9). Edit: After a few months of wearing these, I lowered my star rating to 4 (was 5). While they are awesome when new, they smash down and become much less cushioned after a few months of medium use."
5,Top Ten,As someone that likes to learn about the swordsman/warrior life style this book is easily in my top ten! Possibly even in my top five if you like to look inward at the way you live your life.
4,Fantastic but careful about translation,"this book is a must have to those who like japanese culture, specially samurai culture.But, to those who want to go deeper, the translation from japanese to english has some flaws."
3,Loose but effective translation,"I bought this book for my boss. Thomas Cleary's adaptation is much more accurate, but it's a dry read. Wilson opts for effectiveness rather than accuracy in some places, but it's a great option for those who don't have the attention span to really push through denser text."
5,As good as I had hoped.,In the future I will order perhaps one more interpretation by another author. This one is direct and easy to follow.
3,I expected more philosophy but got sword lessons,"It would make a good companion to the Denma version of ""The Art of War"". It is one expert's view on martial arts and does contain some good hints about strategy which can be applied to any physical conflict."
2,Translated books are difficult to understand,"It's been one of my much anticipated books to read. Perhaps this was why I found the book overrated. I got the hard cover, by all means the package looks very nice and would make a good addition to anyones book collection. But only for the looks. The contents however were more aimed at people who might be into contact sports like boxing and other martial arts. Not that I'm saying it had no relevance to our everyday lives, sure there are some principles that could help us. But for the most part it really is catered for those samurai students, it even states it right at the beginning. As for the words and text I found it frustrating and bored as this was orignially written in a foreign language hundreds of years ago, and being translated it wasnt compelling.Very shory book by the way.My verdict is, borrow it from the library or friend."
3,Good reading,I still haven't finished it but it's pretty interesting story of one dynamic human beings life. Filler words to complete the review.
3,Not what I expected,"When I bought my Thermacells I also bought two holsters. These holsters are really just carrying cases for your extra supplies, according to the Thermacell directions you should keep the unit horizontal, so hanging it from your belt with the holster is a no-go. It would work to move around and keep hands free as long as it is turned off, which defeats the purpose of owning it."
4,"Not bad, if used right","First of all, the Thermacell is to be used in the horizontal position only. This is clearly stated in the instructions of the unit. This case is designed to transport the unit to activities such as camping, fishing or hunting. The clip on the back is very handy, to carry it on your belt, or to clip it in place for use, such as a treestand. When I'm done hunting and am leaving, the unit is too hot to throw into my pack, so the clip becomes handy to hold it to my belt or pack straps. The pockets on the side of the case are nice for the butane cartridge, but a pocket for the pads would have been preferred, as they are used more often."
2,Contradictory accessory,"Not only do the ThermaCell instructions say it must be kept horizontal, but they also say you should never carry it around on your person, or even breathe the fumes. Use of this holster goes against all the manufacturer warnings. Also, the faceplate on the ThermaCell gets hot, so I wouldn't think you'd want to risk a burn by carrying it in a holster. In theory it makes sense, but I've decided against using it."
1,I think This holster sucks,"I Exspected a holster that had a belt so that you could wear this piece of garbage.WHAT I got was a strap that would not even fit on one leg, and if you read the instructions it is not to be worn vertically."
4,Thermacell,It was Okay. It came in a timely manner and it arrived intact. It was packed nicely. It was green.
2,not great,"seems to deter flying insects, but only works in conditions of stillness or almost no wind."
1,Still waiting...,"I ordered this product at the end of May for my husband for Father's Day and now it is July 3rd and I still have not received it! I did get the ""carry case"" for the product, but nothing to put in the carrying case or a replacement cartridge for the actual unit. I will NOT be ordering from amazon again as I am frustrated with the ""quality"" of service they have provided me. As a result of all this, my husband did not get his Father's Day gift and now I have to go through the hassle of finding somewhere else to order and he will not get it until the end of July now...would have been nice to be able to use this all this time. Very disappointed!"
2,Incorrect Product shot,"This is not exactly what i received, The Pictured is inaccurate. It is a slim belt clip holster. Product works just fine, just more upset that they are visually miss representing the product they are actually selling."
4,Not a deluge,"I bought this to replace my Waterpik showerhead which had various settings.The water force is not.. a deluge but simply a nice spray. If you are looking for a lot of force it will not work unless your water pressure is very strong.Overall I like it because you can set the arm and shower head directly over you or tilted slightly towards the middle of the tub. At least you can control it from splattering outside the curtain. However, every time you move the shower arm you might need to tighten the screw."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK !!!,"I Felt as if I had visited these lighthouses myself! The detailed instructions made the painting so much easier and the end result was great. Even a non-experienced painter like myself can enjoy this book. I have not taken any painting lessons, but felt like I had after painting her designs. The author communicated with an easy, relaxed tone to her instructions which made the painting fun. I hope to see more books written by Sharryn Kneshtel in the future."
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"The original LA CAGE is a comic gem, and the first sequel was still somewhat amusing. If you loved them (as I did), you should probably stay away from this dreadful creature. The original leads return, as do their hated in-laws, but the wit and magic are gone. Albin and Renato become silly cartoonish figures, with none of the humanity that make these characters so memorable in the earlier films. So don't be fooled -- any resemblance between this film and LA CAGE AUX FOLLES is strictly in the eye of the producer. END"
3,An unappreciated sequal,"I have to disagree with the negative review(s) this movie has received. While it's not a great sequal, by any standards, it is still funny, entertaining, and enjoyable. I loved the other two La Cage films, and this one is a close second. The only really bad feature of the movie is the atrocious dubbing. I think it would play much better had it remained in its original Italian language format, with subtitles. (Though, I've never seen a copy of it with subtitles -- If anyone knows where I can get one, let me know.) Michel Serrault's classic character is great fun, as always, with his over-the-top effeminate persona. Ugo Tognazzi is also at his usual best, especially when he ""plays it straight"". This is a generally good and funny movie with undeserved bad reviews."
5,Holiday Tradition,"I purchased this book in the winter of my 7th grade year. The story made such an impact on me at that time in my life that it quickly became a favorite. I have continued to re-read the book every Christmas, and it has become my own holiday tradition. Now, at the age of 25, my Christmas holiday just doesn't seem complete without my yearly read of this innocent love story. I have read the story over at least 10 times and thoroughly enjoy it each time. It's my guilty pleasure!"
4,Young romance,"I read this book when I was a teenager and loved it! Bought it for my sister n she loved it as well. Very romantic story but, very appropriate for a young reader."
2,Wings don't unfold on the upstroke,"The wings fold to the side on the way down, but don't open on the way up. Essentially it just becomes a sturdy metal pole with a handle to stir the compost with.I have a small compost bin, perhaps if I had a larger one the weight of the compost would open it up or there would be a longer upstroke. However, I wouldn't bet on it. Even if I bang it on cement it doesn't open. It is sturdy and well-made but the design flaw seems to be that compost gets in the hinges and makes them stick."
4,"""Good Cop, Bad Cop!"" (4.5 stars)",I'm starting to really enjoy the works of Ms. Byrd. She's a great storyteller and this novel does not disappoint.
3,It was pretty good.,It is actually more like a 3.5. I liked Brad alot. Jacalyn kind of got on my nerve a little. It wasn't really what I expected. That is not a good or bad thing though. Her brothers got on my nerve.
4,well worth owning,"I have been a big fan of Garth Brooks for quite sometime and own all his albums. This is quite a collection of his greatest works. What makes it better is that all the recordings are live. It also shows how devoted his fans are and how dedicated he is to his fans. In his interviews, he always thanks his fans. That is a true artist."
5,you can't resist it!!!!,"I love it!!!!! scince we bought it I haven't taken it out of my CD player.you have got to get it.Furthermore,as Garth gets more popular, the prices will go up.So get it A.S.A.P.!!!!!!!"
5,Great Package!!!!,"I have read all the reviews that are listed and I'm a little confused. Is it that some of you who rated this poorly, really Garth Fans. I have been to concerts from all kinds of groups, and I can tell you that I have not gone to one where someone isn't flat or off key. If you really listen to this double CD set, he is reacting to the crowd. He is very emotional when the crowd sings with him. Give the guy a break, where else can you go to a concert and pay $18.or pay only $13 for a double CD. No other solo artist or group will do this for there fans. He is the only artist that gives you more than what you pay for."
2,"It's Garth alright, but he musta been a bit tipsy","I like Garth, don't get me wrong, but he's not himself in several of the great songs on this one. Oh, and just because it's the ""Live"" album don't go wanting to hear Garth sing that mystery third verse of ""Friends in Low Places"" cause he doesn't, he makes the audience sing it and although they do a good job, they just aren't Garth. I was very disappointed not to hear the live version of ""Friends in Low Places"" that I've heard on the radio and loved. Garth's timing seemed off on many songs and in general I didn't like this album, I don't recommend it."
2,What is with Garth Brooks,"Now we are talking about a man who advertises on T.V about the Grand Ole Opry and we are also talking about the same man who played Chris Gaines. How could any man who is a member of the Opry try to go into Pop rock music. Now I will only own two of Garths albums and those are his first and second ones,those are the best ones he ever made other than that forget it his music really got rediculous and kind of lame. This is a ... Box set nothing but some of his good hits here and there, I really think Box sets are ... for artists to advertise and sell because who the hell can listen to 30-40 songs by the same artist you really get tired of that artist after a while. All I'm saying is I just have been a little shaky with Garth Brooks since he released Chris Gaines he really wonders me at times if he really is country."
3,Is Great!!!!!!!!!!!,I like the live is great to hear Garth Brooks again I haven't heard he's voice an a long time!
1,Better to keep one's mouth shut...,"It's been said it's better to keep your mouth shut and be thought of a fool than to open it and remove all dobut. If anybody ever doubted Garth's talent, this cd removes all doubt. The man is without vocal talent. The track, ""It's your song"" is such a hack of a song I'm surprised it even made the cd. Garth cannot carry a note and pulls off every vocal trick in the book to cover up that fact."
1,"It Was Horrible, Just Horrible","Goodness, can I possibly be the only person out here that doen't think this cd is good. I honestly can think of one good thing to say. So I'll just say nothing at all."
1,Garth insults real musicians,"In a time and place when real musicians gather - they shall systematically scorn the way charletons like Garth Brooks have fooled the musically uneducated into believing he is actually an artist and not just a media-manipulating businessman with no more integrity than Donald Trump. Like the money-hungry Trump, Brooks' talent is at least questionable. This live cd goes a long way in proving that."
5,The Best!,"Garth Brooks is the best singer I think EVER i bought this cd hardly ever even hearing about him before,and i listen to it every day!!!!"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I love the way this man sings. However, I am hard of hearing, and I honestly did not realize just how much of a distraction the audience in the background could be when Garth was singing his songs. To be honest, it was a major distraction for me and I had the hardest time making out what Garth said. So having a live concert CD is not for everyone. It certainly wasn't for me. But don't let that stop you from getting the CD and trying it yourself. Have a good day."
3,LIVE couldn't hold a candle to his first album,"It's a cryin shame...it really is. Garth came with his first 4 to 5 albums and was singing some hellacountry. Then he had to go get famous and appeal to the masses. If he'd would have never stopped singing about Chris Ledoux I'd put him with the best country ever, but Merle, Waylon, Willie would smoke him in a heartbeat."
2,Recording Studios are sometimes better than live,While the music was as described we were disappointed by the background noise of the live audience. Before you buy make sure you fully understand what you are buying and that you will not only be listening to the performer but to the audience joining in.
1,Garth Brooks is over rated,I bought this cd for my wife and she likes it I can not stand it or Garth. I do not belive this guy has done any country since friends in low places and he screwed that up in this cd
5,Garth's Double Live the best!,This is the best album Garth Brooks has ever made! I highly recommend it to any Garth fan!
4,Garth Brooks Double Live,"Garth Brooks is a superstar in the field of country music. This 2 CD collection has most of his greatest hits on it with songs like ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"", ""Unanswered Prayers"", ""Rodeo"", ""To Make You Feel My Love"", and ""The Dance"". Two special treats are the long versions of ""The Thunder Rolls"" and ""Friends in Low Places"". I am not a fan of live CD's and at times the audience sings over Garth which is annoying, but this is a good collection of Garth Brooks' best."
1,The Kenny G Of Country,"Garth must be the Kenny G of country. Even though they misrepresent two different genres altogether, they are soulless cousins. This is a good representation of his work, which, however, does not mean enjoyable."
1,Some People Should Not Sing Live!,"I have heard most of the songs from this CD on my local radio station the past couple of weeks and could not believe my ears. The first time I heard Garth go off key as much as he did, I thought it must be a mistake. However, as I heard more songs from this set, it actually got worse. On numerous songs he is either going sharp or flat. Most singers tend to do one or the other when they are off key. Garth does both equally well. I have never heard something this bad from a record company before. While I knew Garth was not the best singer out there, this release just magnifies the situation greatly. While I like Garth and think he is a great entertainer, I will not buy this CD. My ears cannot handle it."
1,"This ""album"" deserves no stars","Do not buy this CD! First of all, all these songs are on Garth's previous albums, and they sound better in the studio! Second of all it's just a gimmick, he wants to sell a million copies of this waste in one day! It sounds impossible but since this is a 2 CD set, every album sold counts as 2. This means he only has to sell 500,000 copies to reach a million in sales. This is ridiculous! Why doesn't every artist put their albums on 2 CDS? Then everyone would go platinum. The songs are not bad at all, but the quality of them live is not the same as on the radio. Really this album is a waste of money and it will be a sad day if he does manage to sell a million copies."
5,Classic Garth,"This two disk set is awesome. I've had it since it came out in 1998 and play it all the time. This is the best compilation by a country artist ever. This album is packed with 25 great tracks from some of his classic hits such as, ""Thunder Rolls"" and ""Unanswered Prayers"" as well as some of his more recent songs like, ""Callin' Baton Rouge."" Okay so all of his songs are older now but they are still great. Unlike some artists who put out best of albums that still have filler tracks in them these are all hits that fans love. This collection is definitely a must have."
5,Great album. A rememberence for me of the concerts.,This album is the best ever. The concerts are electrifying and the album brings that electricity into the homes of his fans. We as fans can enjoy the live songs long into the next century.
5,The best CD he's ever done!!,This CD is just awesome and Garth gets better with every CD he puts out. It's great how he's included the audiences participation on this CD. Keep up the great work Garth!!
5,the song wild as the wind is the best! the whole cd is GREAT,"you can buy it for a whole lot less in tennessee, i know i bought one for 12.99."
2,Not One of the Best Garth has done,I was truly dissappointed with this live album. I am a big Garth brooks fan and I didn't like the way this was engineered. I assumed it would be a continuous Live album instead of cutting in and out within every two songs. Plus he sounds better live in concert than on this CD.
2,Too much crowd noise in backgroung to enjoy lyrics,"A few songs very good but don't purchase to hear the ""famous"" third verse in Low Places. If you just want to listen to Garth as background music while you are doing your daily chores it OK."
5,Way to go GARTH!!!,"No CD collection is complete without the likes of Garth Brooks Double Live. No matter what type of music you like, you love this album. It is fun and cheery and you really feel like you are there LIVE!!"
1,Fan of Garth but not maniac.Surely not the best from Garth!,"I was so excited to get my hands on this double album. But that was all!!! I'd rather sit and listen back to the ""No fences"" and ""Robin' the wind"". That was the good days of Garth though he made a good come back with ""Seven"". But definately not with this Double Live. Good collection though, but makes you wonder how a recording company can go so wrong, by putting out in the market an album with such a bad quality. But this is I guess how the music marketing business goes around. You take a singer, you make him big enough so people can follow him blinded and then you start putting out albums. No one is ""The Best""!!! There are so many great singers with great songs performing here and there but it's just a shame that they go unnotticed. But anyway thankfully I got his old albums to listen to,among with so many other great country singers."
3,Avoid Fotrecords as a seller,"The CD is pretty good, I have enjoyed it. I purchased this CD from Fotrecords. On the case it says ""If this compact disc is cut or drilled or marked for promotional use only it is not for sale and neither the artist, songrwriters or publishers receive any compensation."" The CD they sold my is cut, so illegal to sell."
5,garth brooks cd,"love this cd! It is my favorite live music cd.I bought it used, and it was worth it!"
4,Double Live Review,"I think this is one of Garth's best Cd's ever made. You get to hear all of his old classics as well as a few new songs and add in lyrics to some of his old classics such as ""The Thunder Rolls"" and ""Friends in Low Places"" These are both two of his best songs and are on with extended lyrics to the song. This CD is awesome!!!"
5,stellar job,"Exactly what I wanted and received it far faster than I ever expected, stellar job on account of the shipper"
5,Great homemade bread recipes,"I have made many of the recipes from this book and every one has turned out great! There are several recipes that include ways to make delicious bread in a short amount of time. There are also many quick breads that make good gifts and are easy to make. I have used other bread recipes but the ones in this book are outstanding. It's also written in a homey, back to the farm style that makes you want to try out the recipes for your own family. You couldn't buy a better bread book."
5,THIS THA S@#T DAWG,"MAN, THIS ALBUM TRULY REPRESENTS THA DIRTY SOUTH. WITH HAWKS SKILLS,SHOWS HOW MUCH HE HAS GROWN MENTALLY, AND I STILL FEEL THAT MAN FOE KEEPIN IT REAL,STILL DOING SCREWS AND ALL THAT S@#T, PEACE OUT, 1 LUV 2 GALVESTON ISLAND."
5,Would love to have Helen Husher as a a Dinner Guest,"The writing speaks for itself:""Because for the most part I really don't-to be young, to a large degree, is to be strong but stupid, blissfully unaware of the dangers of gum disease.""and""Horses, it seems to me, know how to relinquish power without being diminished, and there is something important and instructive here, something to be grasped something to be sustained and labored for."""
1,Very Disappointing,"I received this book yesterday, and was very disappointed when I opened it up. The print is so small, that one needs a magnifying glass to read it. I do not understand what the point is of publishing a book that nobody's eyes can actually read. It is too bad, because I had heard that the actual contents of this book are excellent."
2,And I thought Anne Rice's new stuff was bad...,"I, too, was intrigued by the idea of a vampire story set amongst one of my favorite historical periods, the French Revolution. What I got was a very poorly plotted story full of inconsequential characters that doesn't really start to get anywhere until exactly halfway through when we are finally introduced to the character whose actions are the very reason this story is happening in the first place. Historical personages are thrown in so half assed I almost feel embarrased for them. I haven't read any of Saberhagen's other Dracula books, and I'm sorry to say I'm in no great hurry to do so."
3,An exercise in name-dropping,"I think this series is deteriorating a bit. I quite enjoyed the earlier books that I've read, but this one lacks something. As usually happens, the modern-day tie-in to the historical story is dull and practically pointless. The rest of the book is fairly good. I fail to see, though, why Saberhagen feels his books are incomplete without at least one famous historical character popping up. Dracula does fine on his own!"
3,Colorful children's directory of famous hauntings.,"Taken from some of the larger Usborne books, this tiny volume is crammed with famous tales of hauntings around the globe. All the basics are here, including how to find ghosts. The coverage on Borley Rectory does have a glaring error, however. Young says although it burned down in 1939, you can still visit the ruins, which have in reality been cleared away since 1944."
3,Decent but you can do better,The text covers a wide range of topics but doesn't dive very deep. The font in the book is pretty large and there is copious amounts of whitespace that is wasted. It would be a decent read through for a beginner-to-immediate person but you will need to do much more to round out your Python knowledge.
3,Not for experienced programmers,"This may be a good book for beginners. For experienced programmers who just want to know what's new and unique of Python, it's hard to find what you need fast. I found Dive into Python is better for me."
4,a little too basic for an experienced programmer,"If you have been coding in another programming language and if it's OO as well, then you can pick up the python syntax from the tutorial that comes along with the release or tons of web sites can teach you the same. It's pretty straight forward. I have to say here that this book is very weak on the advanced concepts. There are'nt many interesting examples in ""advanced topics"". I c'd finish it off in a week's time. I think this book is a little too expensive for it's content. If they c'd slash the price then this book is recommended for it covers the basics pretty well."
4,Knowledge & Common Sense,"Fellow Programmers,I am new to Python and found this book to be a comprehensive source of information. I started off with Java a few years ago in my spare time, however; Core Python is an excellent book for an understanding concepts in OOP for both languages. I thoroughly enjoy the book and the Python Language itself. My only criticism is that most of the programs are short, but from cover to cover; the reader will walk away with a rock solid foundation in python programming.L.R. Young"
5,"Easy to read and understand, great for learning Python quickly","(This review is posted on behalf of my wife who had trouble with her amazon login.) I recently changed my job. My new company uses Python as the main technology. Before starting this job, I didn't know Python at all. The project I worked on was on a tight schedule. Fortunately I got this book and I can immediately starting writing code in Python on the first day. The book is written in a very easy to read and understandable way. It covers almost everything you need to know about Python. The ""Core Tip"", ""Core Note"" and ""Core Style"" sections are especially useful and helpful. They are not just for the Python beginner to develop good coding skills and habits. They are also very valuable advice for the people who already know Python. If you want to learn Python quickly or if you want to expand your Python knowledge, this is a book for you."
3,programming,this is a good programming book it takes a little studying might be a litte easier if you know c
3,could be reduced in size with normal type,"Decent text, but watch out, you might think you are getting a lot of information after looking at the size of the book, as it's 1000+ pages. Do keep in mind that this book could be condensed to half it's size or less if the type was reduced to a normal level.Overall, this book can be read by a wide range of audiences, from the beginner, to well...somewhat of an expert, as it covers some of the ""advanced"" topics like gui programming and threading. Most likely, this book will be most appealing to a intermediate level Pythonite. There are juicier picks out there in the same price range, like Python Essential Reference, but if you want to exhaustively complete your python library, this book is not a bad buy."
5,Fantastic Resource,"This book is so full of everything it blows my mind. It has to be about 4 inches thick, it is massive! The code examples are awesome. Some examples appear out of the blue (Like the intro takes you through a lot of examples without explaining a lot), then the chapters following let you know all the introduction parts that were shown. This book is a meat factory of information, you could read a chapter, and come back in a week and realize there are more layers to learn. If you want a book not only to learn with, but it use as a constant reference - THIS IS IT!"
5,Great Product,Very easy to use product right out of the box. I like the convenience of no power cord. It shipped on time so I am satisfied.
1,Nuttin' but errors,"I've had it for two weeks. First it came formatted as FAT32, but a 160GB drive that's kinda silly. Reformatted to NTFS. Copied about 100GB of files to it, was unable to read all of them off. Reformatted low level, ran check disk to fix errors. Tried the same 100GB again, same result, IO errors on the read. Not impressed so far. Returning it and will try again."
1,Drive died in 48 hours.,"I managed to buy a Passport 160GB for my laptop bag and a MyBook 400GB Essential for my home network. I managed to turn both of them into an expensive paperweight in two days. I loaded about 160GB of data to take to work on my MyBook and got to work, and it died after 10GB of offload transfer. Thinking the drive just failed, I then turned to the Passport to pickup the slack, and that then died two after 10GB of data. Whats crazy is they both have the same error message from WD Diagnostics software: Failed read test element. Now the drive is throwing up bad sectors and such and will require an RMA. I eventually just brought the desktop to work. Pass on this drive."
1,Not a good experience,"I first purchased this product in 2007. The original device was bad and would not accept any sort of file upload or transfer. I contacted customer service (a bad experience in itself) and they agreed to exchange my faulty product for a new one, and to reimburse me for the return shipping costs incurred upon me (which I have yet to see after 7 months).A new hardrive was sent upon my return of the original. It worked fine for several months, but like the first is a faulty product. I can no longer retrieve and play the music/movie files I have stored on it. I understand that some have great experiences with this product, but I will not buy from WD again. I recently switched to a Toshiba 160 GB hard-drive and remain very satisfied with it."
4,Worth the penny!,"Always wanted to get a portable hard drive. So did some shopping online and read all reviews. Decided to get the WD160GB. I got this device at a good deal from Amazon.com and it arrived on time as promised. So the first impression was impressive. This device works without any installation, use it just like any other flash drive. There's some kind of set up which takes less than a minute. So getting started is that easy. The speed of read and writing is, I would say, amazing for a drive of this capacity. Have to wait and see if this gets affected with decreasing storage size (as I load the memory with my files & documents). There's a little vibration during read & write process, but very low level that it can only be felt by touching the drive during read or write. So don't bother about other comments that claims this device vibrates. All machines however small it is will vibrate no matter what. Overall, it worth my money."
5,Simple and Fast,"I have had this 160 Mb drive for about a month now. I have used it without any hitches on three laptops, a 3 year old HP, a 4 year old Dell, and a current Apple Macbook. It is fast, simple to operate and I would recommend to to anybody looking for a backup drive. One good thing about this drive is that it is powered off the USB port so it has no power cable and bulky adaptor to plug in. The Macbook accesses the drive easily and can read any of the info copied off the PC's onto the drive and visa versa.My only complaint is that I wish they had other colours instead of black!"
5,"Ebay has the power booster cable ""Usb Y cable"" $5 dollars","It works fine on my Compaq Presario V6000, but you can get the ""Y usb cable"" off ebay for 5 bucks instead of the WD one to work with older laptops. And the notebook 2.0 cards are going to need an external power source."
5,No complaints,"My objective was to buy the largest 2.5 portable harddrive available. I found it in the Western Digital.Elegant shiney black case, a blue LED circle light, with only 1 cable, I have no complaints towards performance or looks.I own a larger 320gb but i needed something with no power cable, this is the LEXUS of 2.5 portable harddrives. It even has backup software on it, but I'm not sure I will use it or not."
1,great drive if you could power it,"This might not be bad, but not only does it absolutely require USB 2.0, it will not work with most laptops due to the lack of power.There is no power supply available for this drive as far as I can tell. Instead, WD has you purchase a connector with TWO USB connectors to ""double"" your power (they obviously do not understand how electric current works).I currently own one of these drives, but can only use it in ONE desktop PC, which means to me it's not at all portable. If I had it to do all over again, I'd avoid WD."
3,Good product but.......,"The Passport USB Portable Hard Drive works fine. A case is essential to protect it.The downfall and the reason I gave this product only 3 stars is that the USB cable to connect to either laptop/desktop is too short, way to short. This causes its connectivity sometimes inconvenient. I'm planning to buy a longer cable. It'd be useful."
3,WD Sync software corrupted,"Well, bought this drive as a no-brainer backup because i have no time to mess with details. Plugged it in, tried WD sync, file corrupt (the WDSync_v6_3_130 app). And on the drive I'm supposed to trust to backup my data!I'm running Vista on a Centrino Duo laptop, USB 2.0.I'm sure this is rare, but now I have to either contact WD tech support or use some other imaging/backup software. Not giving 1 star because these drives are typically very good. I'll probably just reformat and use some other backup software."
4,This is a good Hard-disk and it is useful,"If you are looking for a light and small, but which has big storage capacity, then you might want this one. This one would be best if you are going to have one which is able to be moved easily, I mean, it is light, so you can carry it wherever you want. So.. You might want to have this one if you have lots of stuff which is valuable for you."
1,Extremely error prone to copy files,"This model, along with another 120GB external drive that I own, is very unreliable when I tried to back up files from my PC to this external drive. I keep getting ""the drive cannot find the sector requested"" error frequently. I am strill trying to get a replacement and service from Western Digital support without much success. :-[ Don't buy this drive no matter how good the deal is!"
2,Not as good as the older (silver) version!!,"I have the older version of the Passport--a bit bigger, sturdier, done in silver instead of black. That one works like a champ. So I went ahead and ""updgraded"" to the 160Gb black one. The new design is smaller, but at the price of sturdiness--this drive has a much more flimsy housing, and doesn't seem as well made. I could have lived with that, except for this deal breaker--the 160Gb version won't work with my laptop! My laptop complains that the Passport's power requirements exceeds what can be provided by the USB port. I NEVER had that problem with the older model, using the same laptop. This harddrive is GOING BACK!!"
1,WRONG VERSION: DO NOT BUY,This product is an outdated model. It is MORE expensive than newer versions with double the capacity--available on Amazon. Why in God's name is this still for sale at this price? Why in God's name would anyone pay it?Incidentally I own one and it's a good product.
2,Lasted less than 24 hours,"I bought this drive. It installed ok, was recognized, and then within 24 hours became corrupted and useful as only a smallish paper weight. Western Digital's tech support was reasonably helpful, but the speed of its demise worries me, a lot."
2,Does not work with Vista,"I purchased this item solely based on Western Digital's name. I'm sorry I did. The package says it works with Vista - what it doesn't say is it doesn't work with Vista x64 and they don't plan to create a patch. It also doesn't say that the USB cord furnished will not work with a laptop. If you call them about the laptop, they will send you a cord that will work.Very disappointed in WD. Last time I will purchase their products on name only."
1,Died on 3rd day of use,"Drive worked fine at first and then died making strange whirring sounds even when computer not trying to access the drive. Strange, but when connected to any computer it has decided to call itself a 2 TB drive. I use an Apple MacBookPro (which has worked fine with other WD USB hard drives. I've requested a replacement drive. My recommendation: AVOID THIS DRIVE"
5,Passport on its Way to Becoming the Name Brand in Portable Hard Drives,"Sleek, stylish and robust, the Western Digital Passport External Hard Drive was the perfect answer to my portable storage needs. I considered the 80GB, the 120 GB, the 160GB and the 250GB drives for a little while, and the price difference made the 160GB drive the best choice for me. Instead of worrying about transporting DVD or CDs, or having to rely on several USB flash drives to carry my music, TV shows and movies, the Passport provides a central location to house all my media while keeping my laptop drive free to maintain work files and apps, as well as serve as the download station before I back it up on my Passport. The software is user friendly, and the sync function is handy, but it's just as easy to transfer files via Windows Explorer. The price for theWestern Digital 160 GB USB 2.0 Passport 2.5"" External Hard Drive ( WDXMS1600TN )didn't break my bank and the convenience is priceless."
2,"Solid case, good drive, VERY BAD BACKUP SOFTWARE","If you're proficient with computers, this is an adequate device for backing up your files. But if you are an average computer user, use the Maxtor drives instead. The backup software is not intuitive and most users will unknowingly not backup their intended files.Strengths:- Nice package, sharp looking- Solid, fast driveWeaknesses:- The backup/encryption software is very slow and hard to use- The backup/encryption software doesn't work well with the Vista directories- The backup/encryption software doesn't backup new subdirectories that were created after the initial setup- The USB cable is too short- The device will not work on a USB 1.0 computer w/o a separate power supply- Can't mount device as an unencrypted drive in Windows XP/Vista (must use software to copy files)Overall, I wouldn't purchase this drive again."
4,I am pretty happy with the drive,"good:- small- quite- fast (at least for my use)- user-friendly installation- price- designpotential improvements:- could come with little pouch or case to avoid scratches of surface when carrying it in a bag- back-up program doesn't start automatically- encryption only available within back-up program, not for data stored normally- back-up program only allows for mirroring of existing content, doesn't store different versions of backed up data"
1,Worthless POS,"I used this drive on 3 machines with WinXP SP2. It worked great the first few weeks. Then it started producing ""Delayed Write"" errors and corrupting files. Good thing I had a backup. I had sensitive data on this drive and tried to wipe it (with the intention of asking for a warranty replacement). But it would not work on any of my modern machines. I tried it on my old laptop with USB 1.1 ports and it would successfully mount. Then I tried to wipe it (using WD's utility and Truecrypt). But it would only get half way through (24 hours!) before exiting with a ""sector not found"" error. I tried a few times then gave up, took it apart and smashed the platters with a hammer. Western Digital, you've lost a customer for life!"
1,"Bad store, bad add, bad everything","I'm completely unsatisfied with my purchase. To start, it was advertised that the HD would come WITH a case. But it seems from the store point of view, that it's an amazon problem with misspelling, not the store. The cable for the WD worked fine for 3 days, then it simply stop working. Until I figure it out it was just a cable, I had already freaked out about all the loss in my data. And after complaining twice (first about the lack of case in my order) and then about the return of the cable, the seller asked me to send it all back and that they'd give me my money back. Since I didnt trust anything they said before, I kept the HD and bought a new cable. But NEVER EVER AGAIN gonna buy anything from this seller again!"
3,Is a Very Good External Drive if you have a lot of data,"Is a Western Digital...... but if you have a moderate data I recomend the 120G Western digital, I have the two and I used the 120G every day"
1,Pasport 2.5 Failure,"I bought this drive thinking how great and compact it is, I can back up all my files. The drive worked for about two days, then started giving me ""sector errors"", then when I had it plugged in my computer it would not reboot properly, my computer was locked in a boot-reboot mode. I unpluged the drive and everything worked fine. I used the dive to back up some files while I reloaded XP, now all the files are gone. I have read about this Y cable, I may try it. This drive is going back and I wont buy anything WD again."
1,Great drive until it fails,"I ignored the warnings in the reviews, and this drive was great for about three days. It failed and took down other devices with it. They can be reconnected but this drive requires a special USB booster cable from WD, which you can buy to make their product work (I'll soon find out if that's true). WD support makes it sound like it's something wrong with your computer, but this drive is the only USB device that has ever tripped my USB connections. Best to avoid this drive."
4,value for money,small on size..big on storage space..sleek design..overall very good value for money..could have had a longer USB cable though..(hence the 4 star rating)..
5,Exceeded Expectations,"As a user of *many* 2.5"" external USB drives, including some 7200rpm'ers, this badboy has delivered bigtime - in a small, elegant footprint. I primarily use it as a media drive for my new Vista machine. The first thing I did was reformat it to NTFS and it has performed like a champ from the get-go. I can't wait until the next size comes out!"
4,External Hard Drive,"I have used this on a Macintosh for 2 years. It is plugged into my computer, via USB cable, and I have scheduled weekly backups using Apple's ""Backup"" software, without any problems. I sent one to my Son, who is in Iraq and on a PC, to back up his laptop. The one downside for a laptop is it could drain power since it does not have its own power source. This hard drive lasted 3 months. After 3 months he got an error message. When he came home on leave, he took it to a computer tech who could not recover his pictures and music. Amazon took it back and only refunded me 80% of purchase price and charged me with shipping. I was not pleased, and needless to say my Son was very disappointed that he lost his files."
1,won't work on mac laptop,"was offered one of these for xmas, plugged it in and the light came on on the drive but it wouldn't mount or otherwise respond. it did work with a gigantic toshiba laptop. judging from the other reviews here, it looks like the drive sucks too much power from the usb port. this kinda negates the ease of use and universal backup qualities usb should offer.i don't have this sort of problem with firelight drives or lacie drives, or even my iriver drive. only this one."
4,Excelent but...,"There are basically 2 reasons why I didn't give this product 5-Stars:1. The surface is very easily scratched; even as new, the product was already scratched.2. The product came with a 10cm (4 inches or so) USB cable which is pretty much pathetic. I had to purchase a decent cable afterwards. (Which is like $2 at the most).Otherwise, this is an excellent HDD for this price and if you don't care about those two points, I highly recommend it."
5,Excellent Ultra Portable HDD,"This is the smallest 160GB HDD that I have own. It works great on my home built Intel Core 2 Dua 6700 processor / ASUS motherboard. It smokes my bigger 200GB HDD. I wish that it also had a firewire 800/400 port along with the USB 2.0 port. I use it connected in the back of the computer and I also use it connected to a USB 2.0/1.1 hub that is connected to one of the several USB 2.0/1.1 ports in back of the computer. It works great either way. I use it between the office and home with no problems. Oh, and I am using Windows XP Pro on the home built computer. I will buy Windows Vista after it comes out January 30th 2007. I like this WD Passport 160GB HDD so much, that I am going to get another one. I see that they have dropped the price on them. Best purchase that I ever made."
1,Caution: Fragile!,I needed a portable drive to transfer files from home to work and back. I was looking for something that would fit easily in my backpack and found this drive on sale for a good price. It worked great right out of the box. Quick file transfer between my Mac's at home and PC's at work. I had been using it two months without a problem and was bringing some important files home when it slipped out of my bag. I missed the catch and it dropped about 2 feet onto the street. I caught it after one bounce but it was too late. Both home and work computers will no longer ID the drive. It's dead. I admit it was a good deal and worked fine for a bit but I give it one star for lack of durability.
2,A portable device IDEAL for NON PORTABLE computers,"Looks sleek, runs fast on my dual opteron with Suse 10.1.Reformatted to ext3 very well.Unfortunately, it will not work on my Dell Precision M50, not enough power on the USB port I guess. I wish it had an optional connector for a power supply. Now I will have to hack the cable. Waste of time :("
1,Why didn't I read these reviews first?,"I bought this drive yesterday, it worked once only. The software supplied with it was Google (desktop search, Picasa) and WD Sync, but I never got to use any of it. Next time I plugged in the drive I got a ""power surge on USB"" message. Tried another PC - PC froze and started beeping. I had to reboot. Tried on a USB hub - big mistake. Burned the hub. Tried on a 4th PC - drive remained dead. This is sooo going back to the store."
3,Had issues,"When the drive works, it works well. I had issues with the drive not spinning up, though this was due to power limitations on the hub I had it plugged in to. Even USB Hubs that advertise USB 2.0 Compatibility do not guarantee that they will supply the amount of power required by USB 2.0. This means that this hard drive will not work for you. This hard drive requires 1 amp at spin up, most USB hubs provide at most 500mA per port, or half of what this drive needs. I had other problems where it would spin up for a few seconds, long enough for windows to recognize it as a drive and ask about autorun, then shut down. It would go through this cycle for hours if left unattended. This would result in hundreds of autorun windows open on my computer. Other issues I have seen with this drive are transfer rates dropping to 0 and clicking sounds. I have yet to lose any data and it still works so I can't complain too much."
3,a good idea,This is a great idea. I considered it to be a great way to back up my system and files while shifting computers. It was only partially successful because it is not compatible with Mac 9 and only sporadically compatible with Mac OS X.
2,Fussy Drive,"Like some other WD hard drives, this one is picky about whether it will connect to your computer. Many computers cannot provide enough power to satisfy it, often not reporting the cause of the problem other than ""there was a problem installing your new hardware"" with no further explanation. You may also have problems connecting it to an after-market USB 2.0 card, either because of the power issue or an interface incompatibility between WD products and some USB cards. Older computers seem especially prone to problems with this drive.Once it does connect and install (if ever) it works fine."
3,Pretty but not so comfy,"I bought this pair of shoes after reading the first 2 review.I bought the one in white patent.The color looks fine to me, design is sexy & sleek. It actually looks very good on me!Feels a teeny bit smaller than my usual size 6.5, cramps my toes due to the way it is cut in front..Haven't attempted to wear them out yet, am unsure if I can last that longwalking in them.Still a very pretty pair of shoes, I will choose the right occasion to wear them. Definitely good for matching my white outfits!"
5,GIS for the Urban Environment,"This is truly a wonderful book. Although I plan on using it as a text book for some of the courses which I teach, it is also a fantastic reference and refresher for even experienced geographers. To my knowledge, it is the most complete and well written book dealing with GIS in an urban setting. The text is clear and simple without being simplistic, the labs are well designed and do a good job putting theory into practice, and the case studies are varied and interesting. Kudos to Maantay and Zeigler for writing what is sure to become the indispensable Urban GIS text."
5,Just get it,"I saw Pat Green do a few songs a few years ago at Jerry Jeff's B'day in Austin, and I saw him do two again this year. It's clear that he's a great songwriter, but I couldn't really appreciate him as a performer without a band and only doing a few songs. But I was interested, and friend recommended George's Bar. Wow. It reminds me of the '70s, when I discovered Willie and Waylon and Jerry Jeff and Guy and Ray Wylie. I just went onto Amazon.com and bought everything else he did. This '97 release wins my award for best disc of 2000."
4,"Angels are NOT fat, naked babies!",This book details actual experiences people have had with angels. The substance of their stories are authenticated by comparing them to scriptural references from the Bible. There is no supposition or conjecture. It also compares and contrasts God's holy angels with the Evil One and his minions. The authors did a wonderful job in presenting the material and then summarizing it at the end. It will be a valuable part of my reference library
3,good in general,"but not the best. Just want to comment on the sample essays in the book... I don't think ALL the essays are not of good quality. Some essays are for 2nd or 3rd level schools, even the original authors got admitted to MBA program, you cannot drew the conclusion that the sample essays are good. I also bought another book from Paul Bodine. Sample essays are for top schools and much more helpful."
1,Many MBA Applicants Get Their Admission Essays Professionally Edited,"The big secret this book doesn't reveal is that many MBA program applicants get their admission essays professionally edited.That gives them a huge edge.Take a look at Craigslist someday in the write/ed/tr8 category under services. You will find dozens of professional editors offering their services to college applicants.For as little as $50, students can hire a professional to polish their essays to perfection.Non-native English speakers, particularly, benefit from this kind of editing. Almost all graduate school students now hire pros to edit their essays.No book is going to teach a student how to craft a compelling, clever and concise essay. Students should be warned how competitive college admission essay writing has become."
5,Barry Cowsill - it's not about milk anymore,"This CD shows that the milk-selling, bubblegum-titled singer of the late 60s and early 70s has outgrown that persona. He is a poet with the ability to write music. His heart and soul show through his music. If you buy this CD you will not be disappointed, you'll be craving his next offering. Having witnessed an in-person show many times, his original songs, which are not on this CD are unique. The music industry needs to take this man seriously."
5,The one and only Barry Cowsill,"I was one of the first to hear this album after anxiously awaiting its release, along with many other fans. I was privileged to hear this artist sing many of these songs in person and this album just touches on the many talents this songwriter/singer has. Along the way, I became his friend and I realized he was also a poet. He had incredible insight into many aspects of one's life.Everyone should listen to ""As Is"" however don't fall into the clutches of unethical sellers and pay prices that would make Barry angry. He wanted everyone to be able to afford it.Now that Barry isn't here to speak for himself, his friends and fans will because some things just aren't right, besides, wouldn't you rather the money go to his two young children. I know Barry would."
3,Bought these for my grandchildren to start out with as star gazers. They of course I taken it a step fur,I bought these for my grandchildren to use for star gazing. They have taken it a step further & use them to check out the birds and unfortunately the neighborhood. But the main thing is that you more than get your money's worth in this nice set of binoculars.
1,Be sure to use your other left....,"Though I have bought the books for Myst and Riven and they were excellent. This book stinks, it has many, many typos such as they tell to to pull a lever to the left and you were supposed to pull it to the right or I guess your other left. Overall the book was good for helping you to solve the puzzles but; it needs to be corrected and republished or have a web sight with the errors on it so you don't pull your hair out trying to figure out what you did wrong."
1,worst hint book ever,Don't even waste your time getting this hint guide. The online/unofficial guides much more accurate and are always being updated
2,Disappointed,"The concept is great, but the execution is not. Although the unit is weighted and should stay on the dashboard, it tended to jump and shift position on the dashboard after hitting bumps in the road. It was very annoying to have to reach forward to try to keep the unit from sliding off the dash, or to have to turn the unit and re-center it (so you could see the front of the unit) after hitting a bump. I would not recommend this item."
2,slippery sam,while the idea is good the product is not. Bounces around and slides on the road. screen vibrates so is hard to read. save your money
2,Don't stop Quick!,Thought this would solve my problems over the suction cup windshield mount so I could quickly remove it from the dash board when I parked. This unit is very heavy and slides around.The first time I stopped quick the GPS unit bounced off the windshield. By playing around with different positions of the feet and on the dash I was able reduce the amount of sliding.I think some type of mount on a bean bag would be better.
1,POOR PRODUCT,"I purchased the dash mount for the winter months when the suction on the windowshield mount was not lasting due to the cold temperatures, and causing my Magellan Roadmate 800 to fall down. Unfortunately, the dash mount does not fit the Magellan Roadmate 800, even though it was recommended. The GPS unit would pop out of the dash mount and fall to the floor. This is a very poor product and I wouldn't waste my money."
2,RoadMate Dash Mount,I think some velcro would do better than this item. If you have a small dash on your car it won't work. It takes up a lot of space.
1,missing pieces,product came (twice counting the replacement) without the mounting cradle. In other words they were both useless.
4,Far better than the windshield mount,"Not all cars come with a front window that is easy to reach. In addition, the dashboard on many foreign cars is not flat thus making it difficult to use the normal window mount from Magellan. The dash mount solves all of these problems in that it will sit anywhere on any surface and stay due to its heavy weight. Good investment!!!!"
4,Good Mount,"I bought this because I was tired of the $800+ GPS falling off my windshield and hitting the floor. For some reason I don't think that is good for the unit. I really think it depends on your dash whether this is going to be a good mount. I bought it for my fiance' who drive like she's in the Indy 500 every day. She has an Acura RSX and the unit just won't stay on her dash. Her sister has a Honda Accord and the unit sticks like glue. So, I give it 4 stars for that. The TomTom mount for my TomTom unit works better than this Dash mount and the Suction Cup mount that came with it, but the Magellan RoadMate is a better GPS in my opinion, but that's for another review."
3,its ok but ...,"I suppose this is a fine item if you haveno vents in your dashboard. Personally,I have found the vent mount to be much easierto use. In fact I plan on getting anothervent mount for my second car, which leavesthis dash mount a moot point. Were it worth moreI would sell on eBay but it isn't worth the effort.There are people, however, who may not like this unithanging off a vent, and for them this dash mount wouldand does work fine."
2,RoadMate GPS Dash Mount,"I tried the dash mount out for a week and finally decided it just wasn't for me.l. Unless you have a completely flat dash, this unit has a tendency to not stay put. Doesn't move far or quick but at some point I always had to push it further back on the dash from vibrating toward the front.2. You have to use screws to attach it to the 6000T cradle. Would be much better if it was a quick connect like most other mounts.3. Slamming on your brakes would be a really bad thing. This thing is heavy, I have to figure that if you have a panic stop your GPS is going to get trashed and maybe even your windshield.4. Not enough pivot points on the mount to get the GPS to the position you want it.Would like to say something positive about this product but....."
1,Magellan RoadMate GPS Dash Mount,Listed under customers who bought Magellan navigation system also bought this product. This product is totally unnecessary. RoadMate comes pretty well stocked with carry case and window mount.
5,Magellan RoadMate GPS Dash Mount,I am happy with this dash mount. My car has a flat area under the windsheild for its placement.It is quite heavy for its small size and has three mouldable feet which contact the dash. You place one foot pointing tothe rear of the vehicle ( 6 o'clock) and two feet at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions.It is quite stable but will move somewhat over extremely bumby roads.You have to attach your Magellan Roadmate Universal Cradle to the Magellan Dash Mount so you have to order another Universal Cradle if you want to use the Magellan suction cup mount as well. I don't recommend using Velcro to secure the mount.The dash mount is my preferred mount for the Roadmate if the vehicle will take it. It is good to have both options.It needs a relatively flat area on the dash.
1,stick to the windshield mount,i used the dash mount for about 2 minutes. I backed out of my driveway and the thing came flying off onto the floor! It had no suction or stickiness at all!
2,It broke -One leg snapped internally,"Part and parcel of the rationale to buy a removable mounts is the ability to easily take the unit from one vehicle to another and/or place your GPS out of sight when parking. Even while using an overabundance of caution one of the legs snapped (internally) rendering the unit useless.It was great while it worked, but there are better products on amazon that cost the same or less, last longer and do the job as well or better"
1,Not too happy,"I bought this stand because my original was stolen. I found it to be a great idea especially that you do not have to mess with the window suction attachment. Well, like i said great idea but that is about it. The thing kept falling off the dash time after time. When it fell off the dash you try to adjust it to make it stay on, the legs are movable and adjustable. I had to adjust it sooo many times that the legs finally gave in and broke off. The first leg broke off after about 6 months and the second after another 6 months. Unusable piece of junk. Go with the window attachment."
5,Very impressed,I bought this system for 2 reasons. I wanted to use it between 2 cars and I did not trust the suction cup to hold over time. So far I am VERY happy with its performance. It is very easy to move the legs so they conform to 2 very different dash boards. I do not see any reason why it will loose its ability to hold on the dash over time. I very highly recommend this!
4,comments on gps dash mount,"It works.. the only issue is that the cradle currently shipped with the Magellan 2200T is different than shown in the instructions and you have to place the gps in the cradle before screwing it to the base rather than after.It holds, easy to position, move from car-to-car, and to move and keep out of sight when parked in a public area."
4,Love it,RoadMate 700 Dash Mount Works extremely well and is everything they said it would be. The mount is heavy enough that it rides very well on the dash or the console without moving around or tipping. Arrived sooner than stated and would recommend it and [...] to anyone. CM
5,Magellan RoadMate Dash Mount,"This is a real great product. The OEM windshield mount kept popping off when I went over a bump. But this unit which sits on top of the dash board works really great, and makes it easy to move the unit between cars."
5,"Praying for the ""real world""","Through her use of biblical stories and her own sense of mysticism, Suzanne takes us through all seasons of prayer in a way that allows us to connect our inner feelings to the workings of the universe. I had the pleasure of attending a church at a University for which Suzanne was the chaplain and she changed my life. I can hear her talking and see her smile as I read the pages of this book. A wonderful book for new and seasoned Christians, as well as those who are hearing a faint call in their soul."
2,Did not survive in the long term,"Bought this watch because of the large dial and slim for size design. For 2 years it was great, kept time accurately and then the battery went. The back is held on with several tiny screws, so I took it to a jewellers shop to have the battery changed.Unfortunately I then found out the screws and screw threads had corroded due to contact with my wrist and the watch was not ""repairable"". To me this is a design fault since if the back was held on with a conventional plate no screws would have skin contact.A pity because otherwise it was a fine watch."
5,JUST PERFECT!,Bought this watch as a holiday gift. It's more beautiful than the picture can detail. Great for everyday wear.
1,Mona Vie - not so good!,"This product caused me to break out in a rash on my chest and back. When I stopped taking it, my rash went away. I'd like to get a refund on this product if I can."
5,Great book for reading readiness...,This book lets you teach 43 vowel-spellings using 177 vocabulary words.
5,autism review,I passed this book on to my daughter who has a boy with Asberger syndrome. I think this book is very helpful. I.W.
2,Limited information,"By my having AS, along with ADHD, I was looking for a book that would give me some insight on the type of careers that people with AS may gravitate towards and how those with AS cope and succeed in an NT work environment.For careers, not much insight as the gist was to try and make a career out of your special interest, which can vary among aspies. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it means that the career options are many for those of us with AS.My second objective of learning how aspies can function effectively in the workplace was more disappointing. Most of the advice was things you could find in traditional career books. Not much on how to interview well, given our social challenges, or how to promote accomplishments because of the tendency to want to work alone. These are just two examples.The book does a fair job of explaining AS and how it could present challenges in the workplace, but all in all, nothing insightful that can be used to find or succeed in a career."
3,Autism Education,"Most of this book offers parents assistance in educational needs of their lower functioning autisitc children. However, the list of possible job types is limited to manual laborer jobs. After having worked (and lived) with children in the autistic spectrum, I believe they are capable of much more than this book offers them. I would liketo see the authors add a list of secondary schools that offer admissins to children on the autistic spectrum along with assistance in the application process."
2,meh,"i guess what i was trying to use the product for didnt work, so expectation was a little high until i used it. needless to say this product is only good as a filler and not to be used to support anything."
2,Did I miss something?,"This book started off very good, but as I read on the reading became ardious. I found it hard work to finish this book. I don't know why I had such a hard time enjoying the book while all the other reviewser thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, but I would read another shark book, such as Shark Trouble or Close to Shore rather than waste my time on this book."
5,"great, informative book.","If you are interested in great white sharks, this is the book for you. It's fun and informative. I have to disagree with one fact the book gives, however. The great white shark is not the most dangerous predator of the ocean. That would be the killer whale. They are larger, smarter, faster, more agile, and able to hunt cooperatively. Also, very recently a famous marine biologist observed predatory sharks larger than the great white (at least thirty feet long) deep in the Pacific ocean. They apparently live very far down, however, and could never be a danger to humans."
4,good read,"i read a hard back edition of this many years ago, and there were many photos in the book. No photos or illustrations in this one, and I miss them."
1,Disappointing,The info on GWS is simply wrong and hyperbolic. The killing of whales and other fish to attract sharks was disturbing. Granted this was written decades ago and much more scientific information is available today. As a fan of Matthiessen's I was surprised and disappointed to see him participate in this 'adventure' and troubled that he didn't speak to shark biologists to get more accurate behavioral info on GWS. This book demonizes them just as Jaws did. I can't recommend it.
2,You get what you pay for!,I bought this cookware set a few months ago and despite diligence in hand washing and drying and careful cooking by monitoring temperatures and utensils (I only used the ones that came with the pots) my pans look absolutely horrible. I don't even want to bother getting another set via the warranty (which is not a lifetime one like advertised but rather 15 years). It's only been a few months and I'm looking for new pots. Good side is that they are pretty but beware. They'll not be pretty for long.
1,a mindblowing waste of paper,"Like many readers, I had heard good things about this book. I have a friend that simply loves it. The beginning is good, however, the rest of the book is not. I kept turning the pages waiting for something interesting to happen... but it never did. All of the humor is in the beginning, and frankly, if Mr. Eggers thinks that this book is ""heartbreaking"" (or ""genius"" for that matter) then I invite him to take a look at my life ... I read the whole thing and can honestly say that it is written fairly well prose-wise. However, I was left trying to figure out what exactly he was talking about several times and exactly what point he was trying to make by spewing forth such adulterated blabber. The book is pointless, there is no real story. It isn't funny. It goes on forever. You decide."
5,A really good book,"I read a review of someone who thought that all of the ups and downs in this book were uneven. These are memoirs of a man's life. This is what actually happened to him. There was no way to control that. I loved this book. It's the best I've ever read. His writing style is really unique. He seems to throw out every single rule of punctuation and grammar there is. Yet it comes out seeming, better than anything else. He sets new standards for American Literature. It was entertaining all the way through. I don't know why anyone would think other wise."
4,Raging brain of a broken heart...,"How do you maintain a ""normal"" life once tragedy finds you? At the age of 22, Dave Eggars is faced with the sudden death of both his parents and subsequently finds himself in charge of his 8-year-old brother. Eggars shares the personal thoughts and feelings of the raging brain of a broken heart. His writing style is new and original and those of you looking for something 'different' will likely enjoy this book very much."
1,"Terribly dissapointing, couldn't read past the first 50 pages","I started the book expecting a lot. Instead it reads like a very unedited diary of a boring, self-indulgent person. I don't see the hype, this book should have gone through a ton of editing and should have lost the ""notes for a novel,"" stilted diary prose. I couldn't get past the first fifty pages even though I tried to force myself to keep reading in the hopes it would get better. I skipped around to later parts but the story could not capture my attention."
3,A Heartbreaking Work of Questionable Genius,"In the very long and rambling introduction, Eggers apologizes for the fact that the second half of the book does not live up to the first half. He was honest, at least. Eggers does a great job of capturing the angst and frustration of watching a loved one die and of being a Generation X artist, but the subject was a bit tedious to live through the first time and is only slightly more amusing in hindsight. By the end of the book, you just want it over with, so that the ranting and raving will stop."
1,A Serious Flop,"Eggers is trying too hard to be deep in his memoir, and often throws out self-proclaimed ""brilliant"" ideas and insights on life without defending why they are brilliant. The writing, quite frankly, is simple and uninteresting, and Eggars fails to connect his ideas, leaving the reader confused as to what they are supposed to get from reading this memoir. I feel as if Eggars has an interesting and relatable premise for his story, but many people have interesting lives and do not become authors. It is having the ability to have the reader be effortlessly pulled into your life that makes and interesting story a brilliant memoir. Eggars does no have that ability."
2,pretentious,"I read this book on an airplane and became angrier and angrier that I didn't have another reading option with me; by the end of this, I loathed Eggers as much as he obviously reveres himself. I read one critic review that stated something to the effect of ""no criticism you could bring hasn't already been acknowledged in the book itself"". Since when can you write a sophmoric, pretentious, self-obsessed book and get RAVE reviews because you acknowledged -- in a hip, sarcastic way -- those exact failures???? I'm sorry, but instead of aknowledging the books failings, maybe Eggers could have, you know, fixed them. Characters come and go with no introduction or ending; plot lines just vanish. Every sentence is written in that embarrassingly overthought, not-quite-wry, conspicuously delivered tone generally associated with 15 year old schoolgirls. Mostly, I think, Eggers enjoys talking about talking about himself."
2,trivial pursuit,"You have to like the style of this book to like the book. People say they like what Eggars does with his mothers death--I read it, completely unmoved and realized later I was supposed to be touched and shocked by the generation x-syle brutally honest delivery. Nope. I don't mean to be overly critical but there is nothing particularly artful about this work. If you like the whole ""look how quirky and dysfunctional I am, isn't it cool?"" genre, then you'll like this book. Perhaps this says more about me than the author, but I didn't get it that the book was supposed to be shocking or amusing. He seemed to be just telling a story in a very non-literary way of things that happened in his life. I kept waiting for a plot.... The influence on what we call ""generation x"" of MTV and 30 minute television news magazines is evident here. Something stands in for artful storytelling, but I don't know what it is."
3,intriguing initially....but ultimately boring,"I was initially taken by the unique writing style and brief glimpses of profound insight David Eggers brings to this book. But ultimately, I just stopped reading at about page 270. I had become so irritated with the delusions of grandeur and self-absorption presented here that my interest died. Full of gender bias, naked delusion and blatant age blindness (like...anyone over 30 is irrelevant to this guy's life). Obsessed with words beginning with 'f'. Silly stuff. Readers beware. Or maybe I'm just too old for this (sigh)."
4,Dave Eggers: Heartbreakingly talented,"I'm certainly not of the MTV generation, more like the AARP generation. This book cuts across generational lines with witty, profane, touching prose. The last few pages left me literally breathless. I'm going to pass this book around. But not before I read it again."
2,An Uneven Work of Staggering Ego,"I bought this book based on glowing reviews in the national media, and an extensive excerpt in The New Yorker. But having now read it, I unfortunately would be inclined to retitle it ""An Uneven Work of Staggering Ego."" The first 108 pages are wonderful indeed, but the 267 which follow are wildly uneven, with bits of literary brilliance floating atop a Great Lake of self-indulgent rambling. At the end of the latter portion of the book, in spite of his still-obvious talents as a writer-observer, it is Mr. Eggers' towering opinion of himself and the too-often timeworn ""insights"" he supposedly has to share with ""you millions"" which left this reader ""exhausted and fe[eeling] hunted."""
1,Easily the worst book I've read all year,"This is hands down the worst book I've read all year, and I read at least five a month. Thank goodness someone lent it to me and I didn't have to spend money for it. I kept feeling as if the author were trying to manipulate my emotions and not doing such a good job. Reading your immature teenager's diary would probably generate the same feelings."
2,A little too . . . much,"Well. I recently finished reading this book, and I'm not sure WHAT to think. The early part of the novel was very interesting to me, as my mother was also very ill as I was growing up, and I could relate to being a young person who suddenly had very adult responsibilities.I think the problem that I had with the book thereafter was that it was just too much. Eggers goes to great lengths to communicate to readers that he's very self-aware, he's very media-savvy, he's always one step ahead of the reader. And while his tangents and stream-of-consciousness writing can be interesting at times, I found it getting stale rather quickly. The book, in some ways, is all about self-analyzation: what Eggers thinks of himself, what he thinks others think about him, what he wants others to think about him. As a reader, I felt like I was under some sort of microscope, with Eggers considering how, with every word I read, I was perceiving HIM. I'm not sure that such conceit makes a worthy read."
5,Wonderful Book,"I bought this book for its title without knowing anything about the content. It is a very real, very funny book. Had I seen the word ""memoir"" before purchase, I wouldn't have bothered, but David Eggers tells the reader about a part of his life that, if you can identify with, will be entertaining and worthwhile."
4,Insight into a much younger mind,"I am more than three times the age of Dave Eggers when his book opens and it was fascinating and moving to see his young mind at work. I am acquainted with death and was greatly moved. I imagine those who disliked the book are closer to Dave's age and so less tolerant of a contemporary; just as I would be with the work of another senior citizen describing the world I live in. My point is that I gave him some slack and wasn't a bit bored by the Real World episode.That part, near the end, when he returns to Chicago, visits the funeral home and what followed rang so true. The description of the frisbee game with Toph caught me with its athletic grace.I have recommended this book to all my friends. I wish I could go to New York in May, 2001 when he is speaking at the New Yorker celebration and shake his hand."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I expected to like this book, but I was surprised at how good the story and the writing actually is. So it turned out that I really really liked it and I'm wondering what took me so long to buy it. Of course I already liked Dave Eggers, loved Might Magazine, like McSweeney's and I live in San Francisco. That all helps. But the book is really funny and involving in and of itself. Yes, the Real World interview section goes on a little too long, but so what?"
4,SUNNY SIDE UP!,"Have u ever read McSweeneys? If you haven't , then you don't know it's the kewlest websight on the web. And Dave Eggers IS Timothy McSweeney. But he is NOT Neal Pollack.:-) In this book he talks about growing up with his eleven year old brother who is much younger than him. It's touching and funny and it totally ROXXX! (I love that he loves Journey... I DO TOO!) Also, I took away one star because of the stuff about the Real World. (Zzzzz). BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,Hoplessly sophomorific,"We all live with this dream of sharing our every moment, fantasy, or emotion with a vast public. Mr Eggers has a nimble way with words, and someone at Simon & Schuster fell for this imposition on all our time and patience.The lad is clever. He just needs a good editor - make that a good college English teacher - to better channel his talent.There are 8 million stories in the Big City - this is (merely) one of them."
3,"Heartbreaking, Yes","Dave Eggers is a compelling writer with quite a story to tell. He writes with a sophistication that may have come from having to play parent to his adolescent brother. As far as memoirs go, this is a good one, but I could have done without all of the contrived ""out there"" things that Eggers inserts here and there. You'll have to read the book to understand what I mean, but the good news is that they don't really interfere with the reader's journey through his story, so I would still recommend this book, with that one caveat."
5,If you only read one book this year.....,"Read this one. It is one of the most engrossing, entertaining and enlightening books I've read in a long, long time, and at the same time it is a veritable treatise on the fine line between truth and fiction. Eggers is one of the most honest, unsentimental and yet engaging writers I've come across. You will laugh, you will cry, you will think a lot, you will resolve to live your life more fully, and you'll wish you could write this well!"
2,You have to be a 20's something guy to like this book,"As a 40's something woman, I found the humor wonderful, then repetitive and ultimately annoying. Couldn't even finish the book. Did I miss anything?"
3,Interesting,"Dave Eggers lacks the discipline required to produce finely-tuned sentences one after the other. Sure, he can crank out the occasional poetic paragraph, many of which read like Harold Brodkey pastiche (e.g., the first paragraph of Part One), but soon he is back to cluttered, overpunctuated, overextended sentences that verge on transcriptions of disjointed speech. A typical example is the sentence on p. 3 that begins 'So finally Beth procured, and our mother began to spit the green fluid into, a small plastic container,' and continues for some lines with far too many jarringly articulated clauses. The book, which Eggers says he rewrote twice, is slapdash in its execution and relies heavily on reflexive devices that wear thin before this reader had finished the acknowledgments. All of this is not to dispute the routine assertions that Eggers is talented and clever. He simply has not yet learned how to write."
1,Incredibly Dull and Wandering!,"Rambling and pointless, this overhyped tome seems the product of a relentlessly clever sophomore. Imagine Nicholson Baker without the painstaking eye, David Foster Wallace without the searching intellect, or Rick Moody without the verbal talent. There's nothing here that Monty Python didn't do in the credits to their Holy Grail. There's not a belly laugh in the whole damn book. ( )."
1,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,"A better title for this book would be ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Boredom."" I forced myself to read the whole thing, hoping at some point it would live up to the literary acclaim it had received. It does not. The book is an egotistical, one-sided attempt by the author to justify his own bad behavior and judgement with regard to the treatment of his young brother after the death of their parents. Stay away from this book! Devote your reading time to something more interesting and edifying - even the dictionary would be a better choice than ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius."""
1,Trying a bit too hard,"I heard about this book and thought, ""Wow. Should be great. Here's a guy who endured a major tragedy (losing both parents within a month). He should have something interesting to say"". I was wrong. One would think that such hardship would bring some sort of enlightenment. Nope. He can't even write. He tries too hard to be funny/clever/witty/bitter, and comes off as an amateur. You will be disappointed."
2,Save yourself the trouble,"I rarely resort to skimming books, but after about 150 pages, I had to. Eggers let us know pretty much everything that happened to him since his parents died, which did not gel into a captivating story. He is hyper-aware that he is writing a book about himself going through life knowing that everything he does will be documented in his book. It's all too much. The book did not offer anything new, interesting, or insightful. The only reason I kept reading the book is that Eggers talks about a friend of mine in the book. Even so, I don't think it was worth the time."
3,Too much of a good thing.,"Though I enjoyed and appreciated his unorthodox prose style, I gradually found myself bored and then annoyed by it. I found that the book had veered from being fresh and merely self-referential, to being long-winded, self-indulgent and self-congratulatory. Every line seemed to scream ""Hey, look at me...ain't I just too cool for words?"" That said, this book did have its heart in the right place and it was an overall a story that was worth reading."
1,Wretched,"After finding this on a list of ""great biographies,"" I checked it out of my local library. Thank god I didn't have to pay for it. I kept reading, hoping that ""it gets better,"" but it doesn't. Really annoying and sophomoric and self-indulgent, as many other readers have observed. Don't waste your time."
4,A Prayer For Toph,"Okay, this book typifies the almost shameful culture we live in...the pervasive narcissism of the MTV generation. It is an autobiography which also nabbed a Pullitzer nomination. Dave Eggers, whose parents die of unrelated cancer within months of one another is primarily left to raise with the help of his two older siblings, his youngest brother Toph. It is a work of comedic excellence ( the preface included, which is a must read ) and intense tragedy, so much so you'll have tears leaking out your eyes and can't tell if the tears are from laughing or crying. I can't honestly say it is indeed a work of staggering genius but maybe I'll relent and say it shows some measure of genius. One thing however is that you will finish this book feeling like you are a solid member of the Egger family or at least one of the extended family by necessity."
2,Wanted to like it,"I REALLY wanted to like this book. So many people recommended it to me and told me how great it was. I had to force myself to turn the pages. The way it's written, it was really difficult for me to care at all about the characters. They don't have any real endearing qualities, and as much as I wanted to root for the kid raising a kid, I couldn't. In general, I felt it was a waste of my time to read this when I could be reading some genuinely moving."
5,Heartbreaking and Genius,The most accurate title to describe its accompanying work since Airplane II: The Sequel.
2,Get to the Point!!,"Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious. Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book. I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was ""forced"" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug. This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't. I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so. Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any."
5,Please read this book!,"What an incredible account of the author's pain, hope, love, fears, hatred. It's the menoir of author, Dave Eggers, showing his life as guardian of his young brother after the death of their parents.I don't think I have ever read anything so honest and stark in its emotional content. Particularily being a first-hand personal account of the events, the story shows the jumbles mess of emotions coming with such responsibility and stress.Please do yourself a favor and read the book!"
3,Enrapturing...maybe...sometimes?,"A.H.W.O.S.G. envokes a great many emotions no matter what your opinion of the story and its author is. Our advice to potential readers is to not begin the book with any expectations. Just take it for what it is. It is very compelling and ""talks"" to the reader making you want to continue even as it frustrates you. You feel empathy for him for his parents death, but Eggers never lets the story get depressing. Read the preface. If that does not interess or amuse you, do not bother trying to read the book, it most likely is not for you."
3,From Oxford,"""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" serves as an outlet for the authors personal feelings. Because of his life circumstances, Dave Eggers becomes a vulnerable and honest character in his story. In that aspect, he is allowing the reader to evaluate his or her own thoughts, actions, and life. Although his short anecdotes that make up the novel are amusing, the book as a whole is not meant to be entertaining. These short outlooks on life are simply bits of the picture that the author is trying to paint."
2,A heartbreaking work of staggering genius,"Mixed and staggering reviews seems to be the norm for this convoluted-introspective autobiography. I have a hard time with it because I am past 18 years old--a lot past. It would probably appeal to people who have yet to experience much of life and find Egger's descriptions cool although ""Catcher in the Rye"" it's not. I thought of my 15 year old son in fact but I am not sure he'd capture the irony..so much for a dad's view. If you don't get around to reading it, don't fret. Eggers best days are probably ahead of him, one can hope. I look forward to his brother Toph's novel when he grows up."
2,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Boredom!,"While this book had a lot of promise, humor and obsure Gen X references, it has somehow its fallen woefully short of its mark. The first 100 or so pages were entertaining. Eggers has a great sense of self-depricating humor. But a lull in the book hit mid-way and it never quite recovered. As one who typically finishes every book until the end, I can't seem to get through this one. I've stopped caring about his plight, the humor is tired, and ultimately I lost all interest in Egger's story. While some might compare this to Naked by David Sedaris, they should not. Naked is funnier, better thought out and less rambling. (In all fairness, Naked was comprised of short stories.) In all, my patience became worn and I could no longer muddle through when so many other good books await me."
3,Lake Forest Revisited,"Although a minimal read, D.Eggers does an excellent job of characterising the tribulations of an orphan destined for survival. A heartfelt beginning, but I did find most of his book mundane and rather repetitive (I'm glad the author tells us this upfront). I must admit that I am in the minority of my family members and friends that give Mr. Egger's novel a less-than-stellar review.Personally, it was an interesting trip down LFHS memory lane and wish Dave and his family the best in his recent publicity and capitalism."
4,A Not Unaffected Tale of Staggering Pretty-Goodness,"This is something which I can strongly recommend to people in the 25-40 age group. You'll probably find a lot of yourself in Eggers' writing, especially those of you who've ventured away from home and have escaped the clutches of suburban mediocrity.Eggers ventures close to pretension at times, but the meat on these bones is pretty substantial. While I can't personally relate to raising a child, I could relate in many ways. I moved to San Francisco from the MidWest at roughly the same time Eggers did and moved away pretty much the same time (for similar reasons). The San Francisco he remembers is the San Francisco I remember (sort of).There is a pathos to his writing and the love he feels for his brother is touching. He has a fantastic talent for making the reader feel his joys, his sadness, his regrets, etc. that makes the book a fun and sometimes thrilling trip to take.Definitely worth your while."
1,"Daughters Nine, where are you?",When the muses return they will be angry. Sedaris and Eggers both are hopefully pissing off a generation of real writers enough to do it right.
1,Why?,"I had heard the hype. I read the flattering review on the front cover from the New York Times, more just like them on the back cover, the first 3 pages of quotes from all the best magazines and newspapers in the country... I thought I'd be in for an amazing read.But the words were just more fuel for Dave Eggers' conceit. These reviewers must be in the pockets of Vintage Press- that seems to be the only explaination as to why they would praise this book.I found it boring, repetitive, and predictable. I didn't notice a voice or writing style.I struggled to finish it, just to make sure my opinions didn't change. They didn't.Where are the Kerouac's, Bukowski's, Burroughs', and Kesey's of our generation? More importantly, will they get good reviews if they aren't paying for them?"
3,A heartbraking work of nothing in particular,"This started off so promisingly, with it's post modern acknowledgements. But in final analysis, whats the big deal with making a novel out of real life events (it happens all the time). This is simply Generation X with silly bows on it."
1,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,"I guess I am just not with it but just reading through the first 65 pages was so painful I stopped. I couldn't get into his writing style, stream of consciousness, whatever it was or is. I just found it a chore. I was not relating to the characters and some of his thoughts were just bizarre ."
2,Starts well but ends in a torrent of self-absorbed drivel,"A Work of Genius? I had read the newspaper raves and after scanning the first few pages, bought A.H.W.S.G. at a Sea-Tac airport bookstore. Big Mistake. If one skips the irritatingly cutesy prolog and begins with the main story, one quickly becomes engrossed in the sad story of the death of the author's mother. After that heartbreaking beginning the rest of the book is indeed staggering in the sense that it leads nowhere.What is the appeal of this uneven personal narrative? Perhaps the kindness and decency that pervade this work are vanishing traits in our increasingly rude society. Readers will certainly relate to Mr. Egger's touching and caring relationship with his younger brother, Toph.Kindness and novelty ...one sees a lot of that in the paintings of children. Perhaps A.H.W.S.G. is the verbal equivalent of a child's painting. In that case, Grown-ups Beware. You'll find little of interest here."
1,The Emperor Has No Clothes!!!!!!,"If I could rate this book a negative 5, I would. At a time when hardly anyone knows the work of John Fante, when Gerald Kersh is out of print and unread, when works like It Happened In Boston? and I Capture the Castle, are only now being rediscovered, when Budd Schulberg and Jose Donoso slip into obscurity, along comes a staggering work of mediocrity to take America by storm. This book isn't funny, or ground-breaking, or smartly written; it isn't even good. It is self-conscious, cutesy, and pretentious. Publishers should hang their heads in shame. Soon, they'll be publishing the stories of eight-year-olds who can't write for their fifteen minutes of fame. Whoop-di-do! Lap it up, people. Let your tastes sink to the level of network television. Let other countries bring us writers like Marquez, Octavio Paz, Neruda, Saramago, Fowles, Angela Carter--meanwhile, we here can revel in our smug, self-satisfied mediocrity, and Eggers can laugh all the way to the bank."
1,Complete drivel! - A waste of my time,"I should have heeded the recommendation that the author makes in the ""rules"" section of his book - to only read to page 140 or so because the rest of the book is ego-stroking. The first part of the book was painful to read, funny and interesting and the stream of conciousness style put me right in Dave's shoes. However, at page 140 or so- about when Dave interviews for MTV's Real World - the book turns to drivel and is a waste of time to read. All the brillance in the first part of the book completely faded away - I'd put the book down after a few pages wondering why I persisted to read it. I skipped about every other page and was truly hoping that Dave's tone would eventually change... this didn't happen and I couldn't finish the book. This book was a real disappointment and a waste of my time! Our entire bookgroup felt the same way."
1,Boring,"I have never read such a thoroughly dull book in my entire life. I had to skip through parts justs to get through it, and now that I've finished it I'm so glad it's over."
5,For All Living Under the Bond of Brotherhood,"If you have been a brother (big brother, little brother, middle brother, etc.) then you must read this book. It strikes to the true relationships of brothers, as real and quirky as real life. Ignore the negative reviews and give it a go. It is funny, sad, humiliating, humorous and wonderful (Yes it is funny and humorous - twice. Plain laugh out loud); and wonderfully sad, yet encouraging and a lit lamp of the human spirit. Amazing writing given the tragic situations.For brothers everywhere and that special bond they share - a must read."
2,Heartbreaking--Aptly named =(,"This book was so depressing that I could not finish it. The writing was quite good, but the plot was so sad that by the middle of the book I couldn't read a page at a time without feeling like crying. I put it down halfway through, waiting for a day where I am unbearably ecstatically happy and need a little misery to bring me down. That day hasn't happened yet, but I am prepared for it nonetheless. Dave Eggers seems so young to write such a heartbreaking story! I hope he cheers up soon."
5,Definitely a work of staggering genius!,This guy's brain writes in overdrive! An amazing story told in a totally unique writing style.BRAVO!
3,Not bad at all,"It was a good book overall.I liked it for the most part.It's definitely not a prosey or pretty book. A lot of it is brutally honest self-examination.It felt somewhat uneven.The introduction was definitely the funniest part. I thought it was vaguely reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut a la Breakfast of Champions.The story itself was poignant in parts but not as compelling as you'd want it to be given the subject matter.The definite low spot of the book was the interview ""transcript"" from when the author auditioned for MTV's ""The Real World.""It seemed too forced, and it was just way too long.It was as if, ""and now we take a break from the story for the Author's personal manifesto.""But I definitely wouldn't warn people away from the book. It wasn't bad. It has some really great parts.Like I said, it felt inconsistant."
2,A Wearisome Tale of Supreme Self-Indulgence,"A painful, poignant, and compelling short story unravels into a laborious (and often unreadable) Gen-X mosh pit of flabby prose, incomplete (and unbelievable) characterization, witless witticisms, and the celebration of celebrity. Unbearably tedious, and ultimately hollow."
1,Pointless and Irritating,"I'm about a hundred pages into this, and it's very bad. Eggers enjoys providing every gruesome and messy detail of his mother's death, and seems to believe that he can write a good book simply by writing more and more and more. This book really needs an editor, or something. It's easy to read, but the light bulb never really goes on. Not worth the effort."
2,Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Boredom,"I had read that Dave Eggers is friends with Sarah Vowell and David Sedaris and had hoped that like company meant like creativity. Unfortunately I found Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius to be extremely lacking in the creative department. I will not give up on Eggers just yet, however I'm just confused as to how A Heartbreaking was a Pulitzer finalist. The story lacked continuity and Eggers' attempts to wrap himself in the tragic balcony accident suffered by his friend were tacky at best, pathetic at worst. A Heartbreaking is worth reading, but I caution the reader that it is a definitely underwhelming experience."
1,Hurry and board the ship of fools!,"This is perhaps, per time spent (by me -- grudingly reading it all the way through so that I could be absolutely positive how much I hated it) and praise given (by others whom I don't understand whatsoever), the worst book I have ever read."
4,"Some really teriffic passages, but a bit overly indulgent","There are several passages in this book that are side-splitting funny. His descriptions of playing frisbee with his little brother Toph are absolutely to die for. His recollection of the moment he notices that the music at his sister Beth's wedding is the KISS song ""Beth"" almost had me rolling on the floor.These moments are weighed down, however, by several rather long overly self-indulgent passages. His interview with the MTV Real World producer is a good example of this. He seems to get so caught up in crafting the most emotionally impactful rendition of his traumatic life, that he forgets to make it interesting. For the most part, I skimmed those sections of the book.Still worth spending a few days reading."
5,Terrific book...,It flows so well. Absolutely hilarious. He can find the humor in any situation. Great job Dave! Touched on many emotions and his self analysis is similar to the way I think about myself and ..well how I think. I recommend it to everyone who knows how to read.
2,I may have missed the boat on this one...,"Throughout the year, I compile a list of books that I look forward to reading. This book recieved so much great publicity that I really looked forward to getting my hands on it. One lesson that repeatedly rears it ugly head is that a book that is critically acclaimed doesn't always read as well as it's reviews.I was immediately put off by having a list of very lengthy rules and sidenotes that were separate from the text of the novel. I've always felt that if you want to add something to the book, include in the story line.While Eggars was able to portray a touching bond with his younger brother in the wake of tragic circumstances, I had a difficult time wanting to finish this one."
2,Is this an attempt at recreating Holden Caulfield in the 90s,"The book started off tediously bogged down in self indulgent explanations of how to approach it. Interest rose a little once the story got underway but then fell in a hole during the interview with MTV. I'm tossing up if it's going to improve and whether to continue with it, but it has none of the wit or humour exhibited by JD Salinger to maintain my interest and has unfortunately lost my vote. Its a staggeringly boring piece of work and reading other reviews I'm not the only one of this opinion. From time to time Eggers is insightful, one wonders if this is his alternative to therapy if its a true story."
3,"Neither ""Heartbreaking"" nor ""Staggering""","I did something with this book that I rarely do anymore: buy it based on literary reviews, as opposed to reviews by my peers as posted on Amazon. I wanted to like this book - I really did. I found the preface very funny. The humor sort of reminded me of watching a Monty Python episode - wacky, stream of conciousness, completely silly, poking fun at established convention. Even the copywrite page has jokes buried on it. I thought I was in for a real treat. Unfortunately, the humor & insight demonstrated in the Preface appeared only in brief passages throughout the body of the book. Egger's style is original, different than anything I've ever read, but it gets old after awhile. He goes to great lengths to inform his readers how he feels and what he thinks, but he fails to let us know why we should care."
3,Just Heartbreaking,"The flow of Egger's book was choppy and unpredictable. Even with the obscure structure it still caught the attention of the reader. it's like a nreality TV show, it catches your attention while you are actually involved in it, but once it's over you forget about it because it hasn't touched you. The text doesn't really hold much content or transmit a point, but his situation remains understandable."
5,Comedy for the twisted and warped,"I loved this book. I haven't laughed so frickin' hard reading a book for years. If your a dark humor kind of person and try to find comedy in pain - this is your book. Cable Guy, War of Roses, Fargo, Waiting fo Guffman, Pulp Fiction kind of humor. Not sure if I would catagorize Eggers as a manic depressive or obsessive compulsive? This is a uniquely written book, which is a large part of the reason it has such appeal. I think it has something that hits home for most anyone. I think those that don't like it are the same people that view The Simpson's or South Park as silly cartoons. For those that 'get it', get this."
5,Ignore the critics!,"If you are anywhere between the ages of probably about 17 to 25, this is definitely one to put on your reading list! Meshing autobiography with fresh, witty and, at times, biting, creativity, Eggers' work is both touching and incredibly funny. He speaks with an honest voice and his own self-consciousness over anything that might be perceived as even remotely pretentious leads him to address these issues throughout the course of the narrative. Probably because I am in my early twenties, a lot of his commentary resonatated with me and left me constantly in stitches. Despite the seemingly boastful title (whose selection he details in the book, by the way), there is no pretense in Eggers' novel, only truthful, human experience. A high recommend!"
2,Not really worth the effort,"Despite the glowing reviews plastered all over the cover, and despite the fact that it was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, I was disappointed. I laughed really hard only once. The rest of the time it was mostly just a non-stop braindump droning. Don't get me wrong, there were some very insightful passages, it does point in the direction of some of the big questions, and the style is clearly off the beaten path. But it left me with only one really strong impression - this author (and his generation?) watches way too much bad television. The narrative is a combination of personal memoir mixed with wild TV-style fantasy, presented in an action-thriller-drama mode interrupted by brain fart commercials. Definitely self-absorbed. Definitely self-serving. Definitely paranoid. Probably schizophrenic. I'm sure he'd love this review."
2,Don't buy this book - you can HAVE mine,"This book has the potential of being a great novel,the author is incredible, he has a unique style that is endearing and engaging. The story is incredible, the conflict he feels in being a responsible parent/brother to his younger brother Toph is tender, sincere, and often humerous. He had me enthralled until about the last 100 pages of the book then the story line seems to get lost in the muck and mire. I continued to read because I was sure all the meanderings away from the story would be tied together somehow. I was wrong - the book left me empty and wondering why I wasted my time, not to mention money on this book."
3,"Good writing, but that's all","There are lots of reviews to tell you what the book is about. Simply: it's about the short life of a guy who takes himself too seriously, feels his voice is important to a generation when in reality it's just another voice of another 20-something who's figured it all out, already. The redeeming quality of this book is the writing. Good writing. Worth reading, just don't buy it. Dust off that library card for this one since it probably won't find a spot on your keeper shelf."
2,I only made it to Chapter 4,"What a disappointment! I bought this book after hearing lots of great stuff about it (too bad I didn't look at the reviews on Amazon!), and I started reading it - and. Oh. My. God. I couldn't take it. Yeah, it was sad and tragic, and so dang depressing - but it was those long-winded descriptions that did me in. Page after page of solid blocks of text and long conversations consisting of 3 or 4 words where I kept losing track of who was saying what. Geez. I can't believe I spent money on this book. I wish I'd borrowed it from the library instead. Now I'm stuck with it and out of [...] bucks."
4,Modern Nonfiction,"I was impressed with this work of modern nonfiction. Unfortunately the grammar is about as bad a my own, but the story itself and the way it is told is something that any David Sedaris, Chuck Palahniuk, or Augusten Burroughs reader should enjoy and appreciate. Quirky and satirical, ironic and tragic, yet still manages to be full of hope - not a quick read, but a worthwhile one. Curl up on a cool winters day and enjoy!"
5,"A crackling good yarn, a wild romp","""Thank God it's Friday"" begins David Eggers new book. Eggers, a Cincinnati temp, can't seem to gain the attention of his new boss, Mr. Tate. Thank God indeed. Friday indeed.As this wild ride moves from Zürich to Reno (note: Mr. Eggers, a simple $1000 at the baccarat table will secure your comped room! Honestly.) you can never tell what will happen next, but one thing is certain:It's sure to be a bumpy ride."
2,A Heartbreaking Waste of Paper,"The only thing hearbreaking about AHWOSG is that I can never reclaim the hours lost reading it. It's a masterpiece of self-indulgence with no real ending. Dave Eggers prose and style are rather good (hence the critics praise), but sadly, he has little to say. Save your time and money--pass on this one. Try instead A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES--simply brilliant."
1,"Ugh, kill me before I read this in my next life","Hate. Despise. F*ing want to kill. is my response to this so-called work of fiction. Do not -- I repeat, DO NOT -- read this. It will scar you, it will leave you with unerasable images of puke cups, it will remind you of the horrors of your best friend's brother's death. This man has a love of language, but a hatred of humanity. That, I insist, is somthing to avoid at all costs. It is too much for us, flesh and blood and emotions and love, to bear."
1,Self absorbing boredom,"There are only a handful of books I have not finished after starting. This is one of them.The auther is extremely self absorbed, somehow thing that by merely growing up he is doing something phenomenal. I believe the phenomenal thing was that he got published.Save your money. Save your time."
5,best memoir i've read.,"this is the best memoir i've ever read. long, but every page was enjoyable. if you think this outstanding book is boring, it speaks only about your own lack of soul."
2,A Mindnumbing Work of Unbelievable Self Indulgence,"Well written, but incredibly boring. After the first one hundred pages or so absolutely nothing of interest takes place. The book is one overlong narrative that covers a brief portion of a relatively dull life."
2,Was David Sedaris put up to writing that one-line review?,"How Dave Eggers be put in the same category as David Sedaris is beyond me. The book was okay. The title annoying. He sounded fairly interesting on a Charlie Rose interview, but I really suspect the guy doesn't have another story to write after this one. His prose are nonexistent; his vocabulary is limited (yeah, i know that's how real people speak); and the ending was a bratty ranting of sorts. I admire his dedication to his younger brother, though. I just don't think he hits the core like Sedaris and he's not nearly has humorous. Just my opinion."
3,My Parents Are Dead,"It's good, but worthy of just one read. There's no depth, it seems, and Eggers' anti-anti-irony approach here communicates nil.Still, it's a good, thick book, and I give it a star for every time I've used it to prop this broken lawn chair in my garden."
1,a heartbreaking work of staggering genius,i rarely give up on a book . are we suppose to like this book because of the title? its a bloody bore and it made me weary to read it. i gave up . 2 thumbs down.
5,Fabulash!,"This book is more knee slapping fun than all the Cannon Ball Run movies put together and then played backward during a rainy recess. Dave Eggers IS Gertrude Stein. The lesbian coding is pure genius as less savvy readers will actually think Toph is his biological brother. If you are still in a codependent relationship after you've read this tome and completed the acompanying workbook exercises well then, there is something wrong with you."
1,What a horrible book!,"Never have I felt so duped for believing all of the hype and critical acclaim that surrounds this pathetic excuse for a book. In purchasing the book I wondered -- is it an autobiography? a novel? a memoir? In case you were also wondering is none of those things. It ""reads"" like a nonsensical rambling on of Dave Eggers mundane and often totally pathetic (e.g. audition for The Real World) thoughts and life events. Accounts of those tragic events that affect and shape Eggers' life, such as the death of his parents (which I think was the impetus for this book), are told without a trace of human feeling and spirit. I could not connect with Eggers and kept asking myself -- who is this ordinary Joe and why am I reading his book? I finally put it down without finishing it and returned to flipping through Marie Claire and Vogue. Much more interesting to read."
2,more hype than substance,"Eggers is actively soliciting e-contributions to this column, and that speaks to a certain unsavory neediness that cries out (and frequently whines out) on almost every page of this tiresomely overhyped production. Don't get me wrong, there's some good writing here, but it's good in the way of an angry, self-confident twentysomething rattling the bars of the human cage-- as we all rattled them once upon a time-- and in the end, what really works here is less the story than the projected attitude of the writer. Whether Eggers can tell a story, write a REAL novel, whether he's a real writer or simply someone who had particularly bad-- uniquely bad-- luck as a human being and turned that bad luck into literary grist for profit-- this question will only be answered when he steps up to the plate for his next at-bat."
1,Juvenile at best,"In the lengthy and tedious introduction (chock full of thirteen-year-old-type humor), the author urges readers to skip over certain less-well-crafted passages of the book. Take his mock-humble advice and skip the entire thing. This memoir is neither heartbreaking nor staggering and most definitely not a work of genius. You will find a much better exploration of family life in David Sedaris' NAKED and a much more truthful look at how illness affects our lives in THE RED DEVIL: TO HELL WITH CANCER AND BACK."
1,a heartbreaking work of staggering genius,"My high school book club wanted to read this book. It's a Catholic school and 2 students loved the book. I foraged through the whole thing looking for topics that would work with my students. Maybe I'm a prude but with so many expletives and other objectionable topics in this junker, I thought I could be hauled off to the ""big house"" if we read this book.Yes, Dave Eggers has done a truthful account of his life and I did feel for him at times, but the ending really made me feel ripped off and used."
2,My reivew of AHBOSG,"When I bought the book, I was so excited because it had received so many good reviews. I thought it would really be a good book. I read it and I was very disappointed. I expected more from the book since it received such good reviews. Dave Eggers is not a very professional writer and cannot express his ideas. An example is his numerous cursing. This shows he has to use unappropriate words to get his feelings across. This is a sign of an amatuer writer. I was very disappointed in this book and do not recommend it."
3,More stars less stars,"This is a pretty interesting device.It is.Would you prefer Joyce? Or maybe the Sound and the Fury? Break a watch to take it to the repair shop.Perhaps this is an example -- what is an example? -- of a sort of postmodern flow of -- what is consciousness? Is this it?I wonder how many wonder like this?This book is an interesting device. $100,000?Wow. We can all do that but don't. Congrats!Did it have to be so big?I would have prefered less use of certain words I was taught never to use. But then I am not the one on display here."
1,A 400+ page rant!,"This book was absolutely horrible. While the premise is a touching story, Eggers proceeds to take every bit of emotion out of his situation and replace it with useless details about his life. Unless you care about what a 20-year-old man eats in a day, I can't think of a reason to read this book."
5,Amazing,"A long and sometimes tough read. So very emotional - so vivid, so real, and, so inspiring. A talented writer and thinker, Eggers 'gets it' in this book and if you are fortunate enough to read it, you will too.It is one of best books of this generation."
2,...A Terrifying Work of Unsubstantiated Ego,"I was intrigued enough by the clever ramblings that precede the actual telling of this memoir. These ""introductions"" aren't neccessarily compelling, though one arrives at an expectation of an incredible journey by perusing evry last sentence of them. There isn't anything else. He continues to ramble on in such a fashion, that I din't even find him likable. He's so pretentious and full of himself, that I never really felt at all sorry for him. His parents died. It .... That's it. The accounts regarding his brother Toph are the only things even remotely interesting, but they made me despise the book more, because I would've rather been reading his version of life with his big brother, the pretentious jerk. This book does for prestigious book awards what Gladiator did for the Best Picture Oscar."
4,Stagger not..,"Initially I had felt that he introduced the book in a cheap manner. All things considering, sarcasm and ranting might not be completely original to Dave Eggers, however they do come with suprising talent. I was drawn in by his explanation of the book, it seemed as though he was almost embarrassed by it, yet excited to have some form of a reader. I loved his descriptive style. I loved how he would transform himself in a single moment, whether it be lying on a couch or sitting on the beach, to some awkward memory or dream-like stance. Then, with a jolt, reality would hit both him and myself (the reader) again.I definately recommend this book to anyone that enjoys ranting, raving, and FULL expressions of single thoughts."
1,This is our future generation?,"I enjoyed the first 1/3 of this book - Eggers has some very real & truthful observations about the deaths of his parents that strike a chord many would be afraid to admit to. He also voiced his sudden paternal feelings for his brother in a way that was both humorous & gut-wrenching. But he loses me half-way through his Real World interview when I realize that I'm now going to have the self-centered, self-involved musings of a 20-something thrust at me...page after (yawn) page. I'm truly amazed that so many reviews have been favorable as I felt like I was standing in a dance club with a drink in my hand listening to a child/adult (20-somethings usually think themselves wise beyond their years)pontificating on nothing. Meaningless."
1,blah blah blah,"There are entertaining and clever moments in A Staggering Work of Heartbreaking Egotism. This book contains some some gems that are *right on*. However the reader has to wade through a lot of babbling and ranting. Unfortunatly, starting from the ""MTV interview"" The book begins to read like a very stoned person writing his profound thoughts in his personal journal. Boring, and apparently, he doesn't even have the excuse of being stoned. I am a person that reads to the end of a book even if I don't really like what I am reading. Staggering Work of Egotism is one of the first books that while reading, I lost interest, began skimming, skipped to the end, and then put down. I do not understand all the buzz surrounding this book."
1,Avoid this book,"I would give it no stars if that was an option. How great this book could have been. But instead, a smug 22 year old writes about his life which could have been interesting, but isn't. And how could anyone write a book based on these facts, and be able to draw no sympathy from the reader for his plight? I loathed the writer and his book. I really appreciated the commentary about his 29 year old girlfriend and whether or not she would be wrinkly. Wow, great writing. And the interview process for the Real World, that was just painful to read. This book was staggeringly bad and I wish there was a refund on books purchased that are just over rated."
1,Save your time & money,"all my opinion.... Time, NYT & SF Chronicle got this totally wrong. There is nothing interesting in this book. Manic ramblings of inconsequential events are peppered with bouts of depression and all done in poor form. For sure, the dude was dealt bad cards, but he can't write his way out of a wet paper bag. The only tiny point of interest is how the young brother makes out. This is the only review on Amazon I've written; I am that compelled to call stink, stink. I wish had those wasted hours........."
3,Pulled in and spit out,The author pulls you into what seems like should be a fantastic ending only to find out that the spoiled rich kid (despite what the author says) really has nothing to say. The ending is bothersome and bizarre and I suggest he recieve some therapy (or maybe that's what the ending's purpose was for) before another book expresses those same immature emotions.
1,don't let the title suck you in - really 0 stars,"...The writing of this book is in a steam of consciousness type of writing and meanders from place to place. The introduction and prefix seem to be the author’s initial notes, doctored a little to add more pages to send to his publisher. I really cannot tell you anything beyond about page 50 because I closed it up and started to wonder if I could return the book to where I bought it and trade it in for another author that I have read before.If this is a gen-X-ers book it indicates that the attention span of this age group has really diminished and I hope that their mental functions have not followed suit. Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it shows that it takes a lot of types to make up the world, and it is a blessing that all of them do not like the things that I like. It keeps the lines where I go short and sweet."
4,Yes,"Dave. Yes. Thank you. Raw, unfiltered, bitter, openly narcissistic and hilarious. It's as much a book about Dave as it is about the reader. Insecurities, rage, hopelessness, the point of it all...it's all there. Doesn't feel like a methodical, concise narration, but more of stream-of-consciousness vomiting of bile and bliss-much like life. Hats off to the young Mr. Eggers."
1,Sorry I picked it for my book club!!,"I made a quick pick of this book for the first read of a newly formed book club. I have to apologize to my bookclubbers! I couldn't get into it and then couldn't finish it. While I understand that writing this was cathartic for Eggers, he squandered his opportunity to write a brilliant piece by using a very jerky, uneven writing style and a huge amount of whininess. I didn't care about the Might magazine part--it sounded like some of my college friends who thought they were so much more intelligent than the rest of the world in their cynicism. I got his point and was sympathetic toward his situation but it just went on too long!! Now I know why I was able to pick the book up for $0.50 at a thrift store!! I'm just sorry the other people in my book club weren't able to do so."
1,The Title is Right?,"Staggering. That's how I tried to get through the book but didn't make it. Genius--a word used popularize works that, otherwise, no one would read."
3,A bit self-indulgent...,A survivor's story...about loss. I can't wait until his younger brother writes his own version of what it was like for him.
1,Avoid it,"I'm sorry to say that I bought this book. The first 50 pages or so were good, and he obviously knows how to put word together. However the rest of the book is boring and self-indulgent."
2,Not Good - Tedious and Tiresome,"This book was terrible. I couldn't even finish it so I guess I really do not have the right to rate it but I tried to read as much as I could. It started out okay but got pregressively boring and tedious. I am even a ""gen-X-er"". No - I'm not into country music or the Promise Keepers. Dave Eggers is a good writer - it's just that reading this became too much of chore - and an unpleasant one at that. I guess I just didn't get it."
4,"Thanks for sharing, Dave","Dave Eggers breaks a lot of rules in this mostly wonderful book. From the inside front cover flap (""Removed from Chapter 5"") through the hysterical transcript of his MTV ""Real World"" audition, to the Joycean stream-of-consciousness ending, he combines studied pretentiousness with true honor and feeling. It's not always pretty--in fact, it can be brutal, such as the opening description of his mother's horrible death that brought back the smells and agony of my own time sitting beside my father's deathbed. But Eggers has done the right thing--not just by his brother, which was truly important, but by his readers. From our ringside seat we see the chaos, self-loathing, pride, sheer terror, pure joy, and the other conflicting emotions in his life as a twentysomething orphan."
1,Most pretentious book of the year award,"Shame on the person who edited this book. Never have I read such a smug, pretentious, self-consciously hip pile of pages. The best argument against the silliness of hype."
1,Painful - he doesn't care about readers,"The positive contributions Dave Eggers has made promoting literacy, as a web and book publisher and revitalizing interest in writing and young writers is commendable. I like his writing in small doses, such as in/on McSweeney's; it's funny and his vocabulary is charming. But his full length books are painful.This book is self indulgent and inconsiderate of the reader. The refutations prepared in response to anticipated criticism that precede the story are an insulting waste of time. If an author is aware of such problems, shouldn't they be corrected before the book is published? The excess of the title is reflective of the entire book and the fact that this excess is self-conscious and possibly intended as humour does not excuse the fact that Eggers could do much better, but chooses not to. He doesn't care enough about readers' time to try harder. Style is no excuse for laziness.Eggers talents are best used for short writing and promotion."
3,but this rating has been averaged,"If the book is meant as a scathing satire of Generation X's shallowness, narcissicism and ignorance of anything outside of late 20th century American popular culture, 5 stars. Genius! Eggers captures a culture in steep decline. The main character becomes an everyman traversing the emotional wasteland of comtemporary society, his stream of consciousness a ricocheting fireball in a hall of mirrors.If the book is meant as an actual memoir, 1 star. Abominable! What could have been an affecting story has been buried underneath an avalanche of (already dated) postmodern tics and pointless digressions. The main character never stops talking about himself yet seems to possess absolutely no self-knowledge. No wonder he can't get a date."
1,Fuel for the fire,"I was optimistic in the beginning, but I see that I am not the only one to give up on this windbag book. I actually hurled it into the back of the car I was reading in. I had just finished a disgusting part about 'feces man' when the next chapter started with yet more of the same subject. I then looked it up here to see what other people thought of it. I am not alone. Having said all that, I do think that Eggers is a talented writer; I like the creative additions to the book; I like the relationship he has with Toph. But somewhere along the line he lost me and I no longer cared. Don't waste your money and time."
1,What's all the fuss about,"With so much hype, I clearly had higher expectations for this book than warranted. It was a boring account of an insultingly self-centered, immature cast of not-so-original characters. This was a bookclub book selection for me, so I suffered through it -- much to my chagrin, however, none of the other 8 members of the club persevered. I was the only one who made it through cover to cover."
2,Don't bother,"I wasn't impressed at all and I'd started this book with such high hopes, too. In fact, I found this book annoyingly self-concious and rather shallow emotionally. The protagonist does all sorts of wacky or destructive things and we're supposed to glean what? Does he leave things a mess because he's living life his way, because he's bereft with the loss of his parents, or because he's a slob? Don't bother thinking too hard, he'll tell you in just a second, at length, and it'll be just what you expected. While some of the story is interesting, such as his work on the magazine, too much of this book is as though it was an equation worked out using formulas."
4,Almost perfect,"This is a staggering work which held me spellbound right up to the penultimate paragraph. It pained me to see an almost flawless work of art so defaced by its own creator. But then, if the creator wanted to go off on an infantile temper tantrum and Vintage books wanted to publish it as is and people bought it, who cares what I think? Go buy this book. You will love it."
1,the decline of modern literature began here,"Dave Eggers' book is pretentious, unamusing tripe. His ""style"", if you want to call it that, involves basically ripping off Kurt Vonnegut and using improper grammar. I should have stopped reading after his totally useless introduction. This man has nothing meaningful or new to say about the way we live our lives. Reading this makes you feel dumber, and I will never forgive him for that. Simply incorrigible."
1,Heartbreaking waste of time and money,"Phew! This book stinks. Who are the people that nominated this thing for a Pulitzer Prize? And how in the world did it become a ""finalist""? My read is that Dave Eggers is a self-centered geek. Who cares about his goofy life? He has my empathy for losing his parents to cancer. No doubt it was tough on his whole family and a considerable emotional strain. And his helping to take care of his younger bother is surely a noble cause. But come on, this guy has done nothing to write about. If he has, he certainly didn't mention it in the book. Was it his goofball magazine ""Might""? His failure to get on the ""Real World""? I found that book to be entirely boring from beginning to end. His attempt at humor is lame. Save your time and money. The only book I can recall being worse than this one is worthless tripe Milton Berle's son (my daddy didn't love me enough) wrote about his dad."
2,I finished it...,"Did Eggers write this confessional because he didn't make it onto the Real World? He just wrote a book and found a publisher to expose his each and every thought? Ick.In spots it was sincere, but basically proved to me why I am not ready to write myself--what does a 20-something really have to say that could be of any import to anyone but himself?It reads like a Real World episode, addictive but essentially exhibitionistic claptrap."
2,Very disappointed.,I bought this book because I read all the glowing reviews it got. Dave Eggers is definitely a witty writer but this memoir is just a jumble of different ideas that never lend themselves to a common theme. The sad part is that this book had so much potential to be great. If Eggers had concentrated his writing on the dynamic between himself and his 10-year-old brother (who Eggers became guardian of when he was 22 years old after the death of both parents) the book would have been great. I found that aspect of the story most compelling.Instead you get stream of conscious prose detailing uninteresting events (even for a 20 something).I found it to be a waste of material.
5,It soars!,"This is a memoir, but it could stand as a showcase of great 'memoir-like' writing that is so popular nowadays. As a stylist, Eggers is incredibly fluid, his sentences running on ecstatically, brilliantly leaping and bounding. Parts of the book clearly needed to be edited more (The 'MTV interview' that I finally had to skip over, for example.) Other parts go on for a bit too long, but in the end this is truly a wondrous and audacious display of pseudo-journalism and self-absorbed/self-mocking story telling. Definitely a book you should check out, not a perfect one, but worth your attention! Quite witty and fun! Also recommended: WILL@epicqwest.com (a medicated memoir) by Tom Grimes, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"
1,The most self-indulgent author I have ever read.,I impose some sort of perverse rule upon myself that once I start a book I do not allow myself to quit reading it. That is the ONLY reason I finished this book. I absolutely cannot believe this book got such good reviews. It is truly one of the worst books I have ever read. At the end - trust me - the most ridiculously bad ending ever - if I had not been on a train at the time the book would have hit the wall. Stay away!
3,Too much self absorption,"Eggers book demonstrates strong writing, an eye for charming detail, a certain insight into the human condition; however, where it fails is in delivering a coherent story. For me for a story to work it must have some plot. This story does not.After pages and pages of self referencing his self referencing through a looking glass of infinite mirrors, the book becomes tedious.There's no denying eggers has talent. I just wish he'd have used some of it to build a story and not a long series of sometimes witty and sometimes perceptive monologues on the exact state of his psyche at any given moment."
2,a talented writer but not a genius,"This book had potential, and if only a good editor had toned down some of the overly instrusive self-conscious elements, it may have been accurately titled. But what could have been an interesting narrative technique was, in the end, too self-indulgent and distracting. The story itself is very touching and interesting on a personal and societal level. Or maybe I'm just too old? Anyway, I'm looking forward to his next book. I think I'll give Dave Eggers another chance."
2,High hopes dashed on the rocks,"This is a frustrating book, to say the least. The forward and the first chapter are stunning pieces of writing, and through the course of the book, Eggers plays with different devices that add some sparkle. But, when all is said and done, the echoes of the echoes of the echoes become tiresome, and you find yourself wandering around in a verbal cul de sac, wondering if you'll ever be allowed to leave. While much of this book srikes a nerve on a personal level, Eggers seems to be trying too hard to become the voice of a generation."
3,Maybe I'm too old for this book,"Eggers is clearly a fine writer with a lot of talent but this book was tedious too many times for my taste. The tedium lies in his staggering narcissism, which as another reviewer pointed out is typical of someone his age (22 when the narrative begins). Fine, but that doesn't necessarily mean that 22-year-old self-obsession makes for a compelling or worthwhile read. (I don't know very many 22-year-olds who are all that fascinating no matter what their personal lives are like.) And there are loooong, boringly long passages about his magazine ""Might"", which just comes across as sophomoric, childish and spiteful. Not that he is unaware that it's childish and spiteful. Eggers is very funny though and he has a gift for spinning a sad story with humor. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to anyone over 40 (as I am). Readers in their teens and early 20's will probably appreciate the book much more, as it's firmly in the tradition of ""Catcher in the Rye""."
2,Title should have tipped me off,"I was disappointed by this book, Eggers can write, but his self conscious self referential style gets pretty irritating. Unlike some readers I found it readable enough to make it all the way through. Some parts of this are great, but it's about 200 pages too long. Eggers shows a lot of promise, but he's in dire need of an editor. As for the section on ""mistakes we knew we were making"", least said the better."
1,best cure for insomnia,This is one of the worst books I've ever tried to wade my way through. I finally put it down after only 63 pages because I kept falling asleep. It certainly was heartbreaking to have laid out the cash for this book only to find it was staggering toward the finish with no clear path or message in mind.
1,CAN SOMEONE CAN EXPLAIN WHY EGGERS MAKES PEOPLE SICK?,"I can't get past a nagging feeling of disdain for Eggers,and it really gets in the way of reading his book. I can't put my finger on it-- there's something about HIM that just is so creepy. It isn't ""jealousy""...because there are plenty of authors who could fit in this vein that I don't feel such disdain for... it's something more.. and it comes through in the books and in the public persona... but I can't figure it out... If anyone else has a handle on it, can you please post it in your review?"
3,I wasted my time on a few laughs,"I finally got around to reading AHWOSG after being admonished to do so several years ago by a lanky, blonde-headed Goth guy with a lisp. I'm glad I didn't start the book back then because I doubt that I had the kind of patience necessary to sit through 450+ pages of self-indulgent run-on sentences, steamrolled characters, and detailed descriptions of every little brain fart that loosed itself in Dave Egger's head while he was writing. Don't get me wrong: it's not like I've developed that kind of patience in the interim. It's more like I developed a curiousity about what makes a book a bestseller, what makes it ""the talk of the town"", so to speak, and what merits a good run at a Pulitzer Prize. After reading Egger's book, which succeeded in all three of those ventures, I'm still puzzled by its success."
2,"A strong start, interesting style at first, and then.....","While I like a well-put sentence as much as the next guy, by the time I got two-thirds of the way through this book, no, wait, maybe 60%, well, OK, maybe 65% of the way through, Eggers' writng style, where he frequently runs-on in tangential, tumescent flights of lacy, breezy, possibly even windy, bloviation in an attempt to make us think he's really really smart, really really REALLY began to wear me down. (There, see - I can do it too!) I found myself skipping large sections of the text in the frequently unrewarded hope that he would sooner-or-later get to the point. Read this book ONLY if you are interested in seeing a writer do the verbal equivalent of catching a Frisbee while simultaneously doing a cartwheel (it's in the book), ad nauseum."
2,Maybe it's because I am not Gen X.....,"but I found this book to be very tedious, pretentious and self-conscious in a very egotistical sort-of way. The first 109 pages were fairly interesting, the remainder is very difficult to read as the authors self-absobtion ( and his self-absorbed fears about his self-absorbtion ) become a metaphysical game rather than interesting literature. Perhaps age will improve Mr. Eggers writing- he has skill certainly- but could use alittle context outside his own thoughts. I finished the book out of duty only."
2,Traffic school,"It looks as though the Eggers mystique has diminished markedly since this book first came out.I finished the book after forcing myself to slog through the final 175 pages. There are a few moments that definitely glimmer. He has a paragraph describing his frustration with San Francisco that is one of the best rants about San Francisco I've ever read. But the rest of it is repetitive and almost numbingly self-indulgent.All in all, reading this book was like suffering through a day of traffic school."
5,love it or hate it,"People love this book or hate it...If you enjoy humor, genius, tragedy, emotion, growth (if you have a pulse), then you will love this book.Otherwise you will hate it."
2,A hard to love work,"I stopped reading this book before being halfway through, simply because I found it hard work and wanted to read something more immediately rewarding. I then read The Unconsoled and Ishmael, neither of which I could put down. AHWOSG does have some very entertaining passages but deep down I always felt I would give up because the book is never wholly satisfying. Really, its mostly a rant. A truly great writer would not find it especially difficult or challenging to write in this rambling, unstructured way but I'll give 2 stars to Eggers for at least trying. More than anything else this book makes you appreciate works of literature that actually say something about life and the world rather than just the author."
4,Just when he starts to get indulgent...,"Just when Eggers starts to get indulgent, he acknowledges what he's doing and turns the book on a dime. He knows how to manipulate the reader with honesty. At times a tad too reliant on tricks, I give him credit for totally warning the reader that he is just that. And may I say...what an ending. This book is worth reading."
2,...,"I found this tough to get through. I don't mean it was dense and complex like Dickens or Joyce. I mean it was unevenly written, with far too much emphasis on style and far too little on actual content and making sense. It used some cheap shots to try and draw some tears, but tears a good book do not make! It evoked emotion in the way a scene in a movie about a dead dog and heartbroken kid, with sad music in the background, might evoke emotion, or in the way a scary masked person jumping out of the shadows might evoke emotion. This was recommended to me by numerous friends, and I was very disappointed. If I hadn't wanted to be able to discuss it with my friends, I wouldn't have finished it...I still think it was a waste. I found it to have very little lasting emotional impact.Source(s): English major"
2,Read to page 120...skip to the last chapter,"All I can say is, at least he was honest from the start. He tells you that it gets choppy after the first four chapters. The whole MTV interview section blew it for me, at that point I jumped to the last chapter and have not touched this book since. I would say it was a fun read up until then though, and the end is great."
2,An Occasionally Witty Work of Breathtaking Self-Indulgence,"The copyright information page and prologue were clever and amusing. The book went steadily downhill from there. Even worse, the more I have thought about the book in the several months since completing it and discussing it with my book club, the more I irritated I become by the author's apparent self-absorbtion and show-off style of wit."
2,Heartbroken? No. Staggered? Yes.,"I was excited when I sat down to read this book, and the elongated preface didn't disappoint. I found it amusing and witty, and it made me look forward to a similar story. Yet, when I reached the actual novel, I found the subject matter to be so serious that I became angry and disappointed with Eggers for such a glib prologue. The writing is good, and often engaging, but there seems to be a hint of mistruth and game-playing behind it all. That just doesn't fly in a memior. Plus, the passges containing monologue-ish stream of consciousness can be unbearably long."
3,good stories but not reccommendable,I personally enjoyed this book just enough.I didnt love it.The story is ironic.A family tragedy looked at in a comedic way.
4,book,recommended reading for people from chicago with a brain in their head. l.a people may be offended with the candor.
3,Is your library card up to date?,Here is the best piece of advice in all 920 reviews: get this book from the libary and skip around. You can't go wrong.
4,getting past the hype...,"there is much to admire in dave egger's touching memoir. his honesty about some really embarassing situations is commendable (even if he admitted after publication that it wasn't 100% accurate-- chalk that up to artistic license). unfortunately, there is also much to forgive. the whole section about MTV's 'The Real World' was so unashamedly self-important and arrogant. he could've removed about 40 pages of this book if at the onset he had just stated ""let it be understood that i am a cool dude."" these moments of hipster self-aggrandizing almost made me stop reading, but ultmately i'm glad i didn't. he claims to not be happy with these sections, which i suppose is some vindication, but i still feel some resentment that i was forced to read it."
3,too old to appreciate this book,"Even though I purchased this book on the recommendation of columnist Ellen Goodman, I realized after I was only about 1/3 of the way through the book that at age 52 I am much too old to totally appreciate this book. If you are aged 30 or so or under, I would highly recommend it."
3,Ok book but a little juvenile,"I liked the book for the most part, but it was a little too ""young"" for me. I think one has to be the type to be able to read at a very fast pace and have the type of mind to really keep up with the actions. Not a put-down-pick-back-up-again book. Probably more of a young 20-something person's idea of a great book."
4,a great read,I just finished this book and thought that it was great. it could have used afew less words to discribe somethings but i thought it was great. a good read for 20-30year olds.
2,Half as long would have been twice as good,"Unfortunately the most compelling section of this book is the fist hundred pages or so. After that, it feels like an endless attempt by the author to assault the reader with his egomania. He is not only telling us about himself--which is after all the whole point of autobiography--but it's obvious that he spends every waking moment thinking about himself and how special and clever he is. In so doing he winds up painting a picture of a very ordinary narcissist. Yawn. There are very entertaining bits and pieces throughout, but the book desperately cries out for some serious editing and all in all the gems are not plentiful enough to make the book worth buying."
2,Not interesting,"This book is full of random and selfish thoughts that sounded like the author had the mentality of a 15 year-old without a firm grip on life's responsibilities. Although the introduction was humerous and straight forward, the first 2/3 of the book was not. I could not get past the MTV interview, so I hope for the sake of other readers, that it got better."
2,Too Cute,"This book is about the author being cute. Through thick and thin, the author's dedication to the dear and the really quite precious shines through. Sometimes a kind of goofy charm sneaks in."
1,Forget it.,"I gave up, I admit it. At page 146 I couldn't take any more meaningless banter.Read J.G. Ballard's ""Empire of the Sun"" instead, much, much better."
3,Started with a bang and petered out,"I really enjoyed the beginning of the book. I found it gripping and interesting and read the first hundred pages in an hour. And after that? Well, I felt like this writer was just too fond of himself and so certain that once he explained himself, we would love him. That sounds harsh, but I found that I read the second half of the book simply because I had already committed so much. I am not recommending this."
3,Started out enthralled ...skim read the second half,It starts out with such promise and such freshness that onealmost feels cheated by the lack of coherance and substance beyond thefirst hundred pages. It degenerates into a 'stream of consciousness' careless rant of unrelated and uninteresting events. I skim read the last 70 pages where as suspected ...nothing happened.
2,Belatedly joining the minority,"I finally got around to borrowing this book from the library, after it sat on my ""To Read"" list for several years. The first chapter, which contains everything of value the author has to say, is strikingly effective and effecting writing. However, the rest of the book is self-indulgent, condescending and, worst of all, relentlessly boring. When I was Egger's age, I thought a book about my friends and I and our lives of ""staggering genius"" was just what the literary world was waiting for. Thankfully, I grew up and got over myself."
1,Zero Stars,"I'd rather do anything else in the world than read this book--sitting through an ironic 10,000-day David Foster Wallace lecture on footbagging. Crap, I think I just gave one of those guys an idea."
2,I didn't like it,"Only bought because someone recommended it, I didn't like it, I didn't see the attraction, sorry but at least I tried it"
1,Worst book I have ever read,"This is by far the worst piece of literary garbage I have ever read, it's like a bad movie you sit through hoping for something to happen and it never does. Everything about it is horrible, and what kind of author literally tells the reader who paid money for his book ""F*** you for buying his book""? Don't believe me? Turn to the last page of the book and read it for yourself. This guy is a joke. DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME WITH THIS"
1,"Heartbreaking- yes, Genius - no",I typically love creative unique storytellers but this book was so poorly written and such a narcissictic piece of work that I couldn't even get through the first 100 pages. It made me dizzy to read it -- the formats were all over the place and his thought process seems to be so erratic that he can't keep to the storyline -if there is one.Save your $ and your time -- there are so many other worthwhile authors and books out there.
2,Didn't do it for me,"I did finish the book, but wouldn't recommend it. I wanted to like this book, and did enjoy some of the descriptions of the authors interactions with his younger brother, but found much of the book too tedious. I like memoirs and autobiographical books where the author seems to be open and honest, but Eggers book did not ring true for me. Skip this book and read This Boy's Life by Tobias Wolff."
2,The beginning lives up the the title but after that ...,"I tried to force myself to keep at this one but life is just too short. The first few chapters are heartbreaking and compelling. Eggers could have ended it there as a great novella. But after that, the book (up to about the middle where I gave it up) is neither. Nor is it even particularly interesting. It turns into over-long rantings and navel-gazings of a very young person who writes like he's the first to ever have to raise a kid he didn't plan to while his friends are carefree. About a gazillion young women have found themselves stuck in the same place. But when it's some guy, we're supposed to find his whining to be great literature? Nah. Where's a decent editor when you need one? For a really good take on this theme, try Anne Tyler's novel Saint Maybe."
2,This book REALLY wants you to know it's a book...,"I like self-reference jokes. I enjoy them quite a bit, actually. But this book beats you over the head with it. I wanted to read the whole thing, just so I could feel like I had a more informed opinion than I would otherwise, but I got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better. I see a lot of reviews full of praise here, but for me reading this was incredibly tedious. He lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on The Real World. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because I didn't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we're shown how arrogant the main character is. But I don't really care, I hated it."
2,Disappointing,"This book had a great first act, but then dwindled into postmodern gimmicks. There is only so much masturbation you can read before you want to throw the book into the fire."
3,Needs ruthless editing,"About half of this book was enjoyable, and the rest of it was self conscious blather of a still as yet to be fully formed mind. I appreciate the subject, Egger's willingness to talk about it and tell the truth unflinchingly (about his parents' deaths, ""burial"" and the truncated life of his magazine, Might). I skimmed through the other half of this book, which appeared to be the sort of posturing done by the very young. Some times voluminious is captivating and brilliant. Other times it's like watching a cow chew its cud. I found this to be the latter."
1,An unbearable work of staggering self-absorption,"If you are looking for yet another book by someone who thinks their own disappointments in life are worse than yours and that venting one's furious anger and bitterness on paper is not only good therapy for the writer but of interest to the vast book buying public, here is the latest installment in the long stream of books by self-absorbed gen X'ers. I think the author knew that the only way he could get away with feeling sorry for himself and claim it as literature was to mock his own writing of it. The whole thing is annoying - like having to listen to a spoiled, angry street kid in a juvenile detention center for an entire afternoon without giving in to the impulse to slap him in the face for being such a screw up and such a whiny wimp. Do you want to listen to someone else's raging murderous fantasies?..."
2,how frustrating...,"This book starts out fine and is interesting to begin with...then you start to realize how contrived it all sounds (not necessarily the story, but the actual writing). It's almost as if Eggers sat back before writing each sentence and thought to himself, ""how can I write this in a way that makes me seem as smart as possible?"" As a result, he created a pretentious novel (although it may seem genius to those who go out of their way to be ""offbeat"")...I was so annoyed by the 200th some page I could not even finish it."
1,"Convoluted, overrated","I bought this book after reading about it in several newspapers. Unfortunately, finding the motivation to finish it was a chore. Eggers has a unique (and unorthodox) style of writing, but it didn't add much to the book. He writes how we think which at times is garbled and veers off in many tangents. It's clever, but it tested my patience after some time. Sometimes there would be long descriptions and endless ranting that led nowhere. At 21, I've always viewed most people my age as being shallow, callous, and cynical. Dave destroyed my expectations of proving me wrong. I began to loathe the man very quickly. I think the fact that he wrote this book was very narcissistic of him. If there was any character that I admired, it would have to be Toph. He managed to survive living with a messy, unintelligent, and hedonistic individual. I like to think that there's hope for him."
1,Garbage,"2001 was a bad year for reality, and apparently, for fiction as well. That's the only way I can explain how this pretentious, annoying and over hyped book was finalist for a Pulitzer. Dave Eggers lost his parents within weeks of each other to cancer, and became a kind of surrogate parent to his younger brother, Topher. That's an extraordinary circumstance, that could have made for a moving memoir. But Eggers, who has a huge ego and little talent, gives us an incredibly dull and tedious account of his life with Topher. I worked hard to finish this book and in the end, I just gave up. Life's too short to waste it with this tripe."
1,What A Waste,"The first chapter succeeds in hitting a sincere emotional chord, but the book quickly degenerates into self-indulgent, overly flip blather. Too bad -- since it's apparent Eggers has talent and a pretty good story to tell, just not the maturity to pull it off."
3,Definitely Staggering,"For a book that started out so wry and intriguing, it quickly got bogged down by misery. Though the story feels true enough, the language used to share that story is just a bit too unreadable."
2,a good potboiler,"That's all it is, a good read and nothing accomplished at the end. It may be a true story, but it's also an amalgam of Woody Allen movies, Nick Hornsby, and the hacknyed bonding between brothers theme. All you rustics who like this book might say ""this is so heartfelt, humerously sentimental"" blah, blah, blah. Eggers is a conceited SOB. Skip this and read something more original."
1,Don't bother to read this book unless ...,... You want to read a stream of consciousness diatribe from an egomaniac. Don't bother unless you feel curious about the life of an uninteresting privileged white guy from the suburbs. Don't bother unless you are compelled to hear every thought that ever entered a person's head - no matter how ridiculous. Don't bother unless you have money to burn on pages of endless ramblings from someone who has never truly struggled in life. Don't bother unless you like and believe the hype of the publishing machine.
1,blah,"After wading through the title and all the ""rules"" for reading the book, I read the first 30 pages, a sad tale of his mom dying in her own blood and mucus and puke. How many times did he need to describe the tub of blood and mucus she spit into? Anyways, I knew what was coming and followed his ""rule"" by skipping to page 123. Wah wah, woe is me. The book still wallowed while trying to be funny. This cutesy cheesy tongue in cheek type of Sedaris wink at yourself in the mirror while writing kind of humor. PUKE! A little rimshot of drums played in my head after certain lines, and the book fell from my hands as I drifted off to sleep. You might like it if you enjoy amatuer night at the comedy club and old brady bunch reruns."
1,Breaks Your Heart Because It's So Terrible,"This book is nothing more than the diary of an arrogant, immature 16 year old. It's not funny, not insightful and not worth your time. Amazingly, despite Eggface's attempts to be hip and edgy, he was able to put me to sleep in about 5 pages. Sadly, the critics have mistaken his cutsey, self-important style for literary talent."
2,Not so good. I wouldn't believe the other reviewers....??,"I read everyone else's reviews and bought the book. It really is not that great. He was very funny in some areas, but the book just drags on and on. All he does is whine about his problems using sarcasm and a sense of humor. I feel sorry for him, but not enough to recommend this book."
1,A Disappointing Piece of Rambling Garbage...,"I like all types of literature...I read about 60 books per year (while working and going to grad school) and so I consider myself pretty well read and will give anything a chance. This book was recommended to me by a friend and I was really excited to read it, but was very disappointed from page 1. I have never read a worse book. It is immature, sloppy, artsy drivel that adds up to a whole lot of nothing. I have no idea how it got such good reviews and even won awards. In fact, I can't figure out how this garbage even got published in the first place. Eggers is not a genius for writing this book, but is one for convincing critics that this book is worth reading. You couldn't force me to read this book again. Even at gun point, I'd refuse to even open the cover."
5,Staggeringly Amazing,"This book is one of the greatest I have ever encountered. Written by David Eggers, it traces the intricacies of the author's childhood; from the tragic experience of his mother and father's passing to his struggles and witty commentary on raising his younger sibling. Embued with Gen X sarcasm, Eggers speaks with a voice that forces the reader to contemplate the complications and experiences of the youth of modern America in a most captivating manner."
3,And me too,"My mother died of cancer when I was 15 and my father followed 11 months later. I thought I was the only person in history to have survived an adolescence of such unique loneliness and pain. Further, an older sister fell heir to my care and that of a younger sister. My older sister suffers from untold bitterness about that turn of fate thirty years ago. I was interested to learn if Dave Eggers was nursing the same bitterness and relieved to conclude that he was not.Some tragedies are unspeakably worse than others."
5,"Excellent, Visceral, Outlandish, Sad, Funny","This book is an amazing work of art. I say 'a work of art' because few things in life can be classified as such. This is an autobiographical story about its author, who edits the immensely brilliant Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly (If you've never heard of it nor have never bought one, please do not as we, the fans, would like it to remain as unaccessible to the public at large as possible). Can you please pass the salt? Regardless, A.H.W.o.S.G. is a current masterpiece, a classical tale of one lad's struggle to regain his compassion and control and, more important, his identity in the face of tragedy. This books spills the beans of a human soul. Some will cringe at the pure bare nakedness of it. Others will embrace it. Enjoy."
1,Staggering Self Indulgence,"I opened this book expecting my heart to break and to be staggered with genius. Okay, my expectations were a little high but this book was terribly disappointing. In fact, I continued reading it only because with all its acclaim, I thought it must at some point become interesting. But no, it never happened. The only staggering part was the author's sheer self indulgence with his endless whiny riffs on life's worries and stresses. These are a major part of the book but they became old real fast.Its title is wonderful and Eggers writes with high energy. But there is no real story here."
3,It falls apart,"As other reviewers have said, the book starts out strong, but it becomes so self-indulgent I abandoned it. It's interesting how little we find out about Toph when the book is ostensibly about the art of raising him. Other family members are also only sketchily drawn. The really big personality is the narrator's, and his testiness and self-loathing become tiresome. While a promising first work, HWSG is over-rated."
2,Super Egotistical,"Basically, if you want to know what this book is like, just imagine a self-important 'super-casual cool' hipster who spends most of 500 pages trying to be funny and self-depricating, with rare success. There has to be more to good writing than conversationality."
2,thumbs down,"the first 50 pages or so are promising. it seems like it is going to be a quirky, honest depiction of this young man's life after his parents die and he becomes the guardian of his young brother. and as long as he stays with that, the story is compelling. unfortunately, most of the book is full of random stories about his uninteresting life told in such a self-conciously, self centered way. every bad thing that happens to anyone he has ever met manages to be completely about him. he thinks he's infinitely more clever than the rest of the world and more entitled to attention and he acknowledges this. it's as if he thinks that by admitting his faults, the reader no longer has the right to be annoyed by them. but they do and i was. the writing is scattered and lazy and i don't know how it got published."
2,Made it through....barely,"I apparently do not have the sophisticated reading palet that some critics do. It's not that his life story is not interesting and that I didn't want to know what happens to him and his brother BUT....I cannot stand his writing style! Run on paragraphs that last pages long was only one unbearable aspect of his writing style. There was also the random tangents into his daydreams which did add flavor but were entirely too long and often unclear. And his dialogue! There are these long sections of dialogue where it becomes extremely difficult to differentiate between characters. At one point you almost question the dialogue entirely as it seems his younger brother completely falls out of ""character."" But I made it through...barely. And I truly was caught up at the end wanting to know what happens to them but then he started up again with his blurred reality and randomness and it was all I could do to not jump out a window."
5,Lenses,"As I write this short note, I see there are nearly a thousand reviews of this book here, so I will not add to that heap. What interests me more is the number and range of reviews.So many lenses. One lens might be the rational-literary-geek. Another the person who's yet to suffer life's outrageous slings, and cathexis is impossible. Another has taken on a brother or sister after sudden tragedy. And more. I am an old man, and the book quiet simply touched me to my core. I've read thousands of books, and some I can praise on my narrow view of literary merit. This one connected in such a way as to stop my meta-commenting about the writing, and that means I was ""in"" the book. My tears were tears for myself. When I am on a freeway and see the cars people are driving, I am amazed at people's choices, yet expect the driver has a story to tell that would cause me to forget the car. For this book, I love the title, I love the vehicle, and most of all I love the story and what it means to me personally."
2,More self-indulgent tripe,"Books like this make me wonder why I bother reading ""hip"" authors. This book, like Jonathan Franzen's THE CORRECTIONS, is hopelessly self absorbed. Nothing about the author or any of the other characters is compelling. I kept waiting for some substance, but found none. Sure, there are some clever passages, but these are more than outweighed by dull dull dull sections. Dialog is especially hard to follow, particularly when the younger brother breaks character and speaks like an adult.This work is a fine personal journal, but for the rest of us it's not worth the time, effort and money to read it."
2,Long and tiresome with the occasional sparks...,"Yes, I did enjoy parts of this book. But for the most part, I found this book to drag go on and on and on... It was touching in some aspects, in some ways it was so very shallow. I wouldn't say 'don't read it', but definitely don't expect this to be a page turner b/c that it is not! I guess I just expected so much more from the title and the 'rules' - it seems like it could be such a great read but unfortunately, it isn't quite that."
2,My love for this book ended with the acknowledgements.,"I did not like this book. Parts of it were really interesting but mostly it was boring and pretentious, the author just goes on and on about things that put me to sleep like tossing around a Frisbee with his brother on the beach.Dave Eggers is not beyond his years he just thinks he is and wants others to see him that way. Even though there are a lot of emotional things going on it seems that Dave doesn't really grasp what is happening and sort of always has this living in la la land attitude. Most of the time I felt like he was just spewing big words that he plastered all over sunshine in a the world is beautiful type outlook.I found most of the things he thought were witty pretty insulting/hurtful to people in general. This book exudes false optimism."
2,"Started strong, ended as a crapheap","This book started strong, really strong, but quickly became really bad. I kept reading it all the way to the end, hoping it would becoming interesting again, but it never did. It's self indulgent, vapid, and worst of all, boring. I started the book knowing nothing about Dave Eggers, and feeling pretty neutral about him, but by the end of the book I actually felt kind of angry at him for wasting my time.The only reason I've given it two stars is because it's a beautifully designed and typeset book."
1,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Self Indulgence,"Mr. Eggers apparently learned nothing about being or becoming a human being from his experience. I hope his little brother faired better than he. This book was nauseating in it's glibness, chaotic in it's prose and boring in it's length. I don't understand how the Eggers' could be seen as heroic. Frankly, I see them as just plain sad and out to make a buck. A definite...MUST NOT READ!"
2,3:1 garbage to goodness ratio,"this book could have been great with a decent editor. instead it's unrestrained, longwinded and high on itself. yeah, i know that's the whole joke, but just because you can make fun of yourself doesn't make all the bad stuff not true. there are hilarious parts and even moments that are really touching but it's a better read if you skip at least half of it."
2,disappointment,"Would someone please get Dave Eggars a good editor? Full of promise unfulfilled, the book rambles on tediously after an interesting first chapter. There is an original voice in there but this volume quickly becomes a bore -- in spite of the possibilities inherent in is material -- as he is distracted from his story and good writing by his self-conscious style."
3,Making the most of it,"Wonderful dialogue and a nicely written memoir. Imagery you won't soon forget about struggling through end stage cancer. The book doesn't dwell too much on that, though, it's pretty matter of fact. It's more about survival and taking what you have and making the most of it."
2,I really wanted to like it.,"I tried to like this book but couldn't manage. It came across to me like a sob story from an egotist.There were short flashes of brilliance but it wasn't worth the length of the book for me. ...after reading other people's reviews, though, I'm wondering if maybe I should read it again to see if I missed something. Maybe I'll try again in a few years."
2,Oh how clever!,"Self-indulgent manipulative unedited clever hatefully diving headfirst into victim culture how funny how not particularly well done. Train wrecks come to mind. So do ""The Beach"" and ""House of Leaves"". A classic book for people who think the Real World is an entertaining and realistic portrayal of life. Apparently the paperback will be even longer and more self-indulgent than the hardcover. I'd be willing to bet a lot of people are actually going to go buy the paperback just to see what wisdom they missed the first time. Eggers will be laughing all the way to the bank."
3,"Heartbreaking, yes...staggering genius? Hmmm...","This tongue-in-cheek work from Dave Eggers, former editor of ""Might"" Magazine, is definitely heartbreaking. The death of both parents withing weeks of each other sends Eggers and his siblings into a tailspin, thrust suddenly into orphanhood, with Eggers finding himself the ""mother figure"" for his 8-year-old brother. The resulting ""true story"" is told with raw energy, candor, and a blustering sense of self-importance. It is this latter factor that slowly drains away the momentum from what could have been a true work of staggering genius. Told in a stream-of-consciousness style narrative, ""...Genius"" meanders its way to a muddled conclusion...but it is sheer entertainment along the way! The voice is fresh (if a bit cynical) and ""tells it like it is"". Skewering everything from MTV's ""The Real World"" to motherhood, ""...Genius"" is at least worth the time to read it cover to cover."
5,Kick in my [butt],"This book is not only funny but motivational for anyone in my (and Dave's) age range. He speaks to us in our late 20s and speaks FOR us. In the early ninties, he shares with us some of the things that we all were going through. A time of our early twenties when most of us seemed directionless or not sure what to do with this huge life. He's a do-er, rather than a slacker, as everyone seems to think this generation is. His message to ""WAKE UP"" has moved me into the direction I have been waiting to go in for years; I have been sleeping for so long: wasting much of my time on nothing tangible, nothing much of any worth. NOW is the time. Now it is time to start doing and stop sitting around for ""something"". Make something. Do something. And read this book!"
2,Genius? Heartbreaking? What did I miss?,"Somebody please tell me just what is supposed to be the staggering work of genius that the title eludes to. I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. There was no story. Very engaging manic style of writing but what was it all for. A great cathartic purge?I feel like the entire book was windowdressing for his pseudo-Marxist ideas for salvaging society. Great ideas but don't couch them in your personal tragedy.My parents died. I was 23. I was a parent to my younger brother. My two older brothers were far from the competent allies Eggers had. I am a Gen Xer. I wanted to hear how Egger's orphan experience compared to mine. What did he have to say about the loss of parents, the taking to the grave of that point you reach as father/mother-son? Understanding your parents posthumously?I'm glad he spared the sentimentality and ran with the humorous, stream of thought. It made for a quick read."
3,"good, but not great","perhaps the funniest and starkest post-modernist introductory chapter that i've ever read. you should read this book if only for that beginning. the book that follows does not quite rise to its first glimmers, but is still a readable, gentle story."
1,Don't judge a book by its Title,I guess I had high expectations. I thought that I was getting a book that would be fun and introspective. A book that is self - aware. What Fun!. I was wrong. I laughed once while reading this novel and I don't think that it was even that funny (I was desperate for a laugh).If I had expected a novel that was depressing and wandered all over the place then this would be the book for me.Forgetting my disapointment about getting a book that wasn't amusing. I wasn't heartbeaking and it certaintly wasn't the work of a genious
1,When Style Rules Substance,Dave Eggers is one emotionally guarded guy. Why all the mind-numbing literary acrobatics ? Is he just trying to protect whatever his emotional truth might be ? Does he just want to make sure we all know how truly unique he is -- not at all like the rest of us who might have had a more mundane response to the losses and upheaval he experienced ? I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Mr. Eggers is unable to transcend the emotional shallowness that seems to plague his generation. But it does surprise me that his publisher would choose a writer less able (or maybe just less willing) to communicate honestly. There is no wisdom or revelation in this book -- just one silly manuever after another to obfuscate some very real and painful truths.
2,boring,"I only finished this book because I infested a couple of bucks for it on-line. Pretty boring and self serving. I was appauled in how insensatively he handled his mother's illness, tongue and cheek? he tried too hard to be funny...I didn't get the humor. And some wierd touchy feely relationship with his younger brother, that bothered me. Don't waste your time and money...read Augusten Burroughs's ""Running with Scissors"" instead, far better read IMHO."
1,Turns you off at the first page,"That oh so hip and cool disclaimer at the beginning sets the tone for this underachieving, overhyped, ego-fest of a novel. Just because Eggers is aware of his novel's flaws doesn't make them any less egregious. Eggers, by taking this ironic approach to his own work, shows that he is a coward, too afraid to take real criticism and much too lazy to edit. I guess in Eggers' world, talent is measured in terms of literary verbosity, in which case Eggers is number one. The man couldn't write a true simple sentence if his life depended on it."
2,Disappointed reader,"I found the prolougue to be the most entertaining part of this book. The author is a good writer and quite humorous, but after a while, it gets just plain boring. I found myself wanting to skip pages. However, he does look to have a bright future. If you're looking to kill time, like on a long plane trip, buy this book."
1,This book sucks.,"Dave Eggers' style isn't funny, and it pisses me off. He seems to be fully aware that no one could actually enjoy reading what he writes, but the fact that he recognizes this (his ""self-consciousness"") is somehow supposed to excuse the fact? Just because he admits that the whole book is a mass of hyper-self-conscious gimmickry, does not change or make up for that fact, or make it funny. I feel horrible for him and his situation, and I understand that this book was his way of dealing with it...I certainly don't know how I would handle such an intensely tragic series of events. He is an immensely talented writer, but I would suggest that, instead of foisting his misery upon his readers, he make a serious attempt to deal with reality, and THEN write a book."
1,Too much of a bad thing - too many pages and nothing to say,"Consider this: if you want to read a book about a true story of losing one's parents, David Eggers will give you that and much more. The problem is the much more - lots of thoughts that just sit in there with no connection to the rest of the book whatsoever.The author undoubtedly went trough a great tragedy, losing hisparents in such short time. But this fact by itself does not make a great story. And, by the way, nothing else in this book does.Is a writer allowed to write whatever crosses his mind? Sure. But does it make good literature? I doubt. I got thefeeling that the reviewer was so sorry for the author that (s)he felt the author's ""healing"" through the publication of the book would be worth the extra pages. Not worth for the reader, though.By the way: nothing against well written prose and loose ends - try instead Kazuo Ishiguro ""The Unconsoled"". Lots and lots of loose ends, superbly written and no agression against the reader."
2,Might was no Spy and Eggers is not worth the time,"This falls into the general i'm-20-something-and-becoming-an-adult-pity-me category that is well worn and better executed by others. Sadly, the book was so irritating that I couldn't even find empathy for what was obviously a difficult situation."
1,I tried to get my money back,"I suggested this book to my book club without having read it first. Big mistake! All of us hated this book so much, that we wrote a letter to the publisher asking for our money back. Perhaps we don't understand Gen-Xers, but it seemed to all of us to be a book about NOTHING. At least Seinfeld made us laugh!We now have a rule that no book is to be recommended to the club without having first read it yourself!"
1,never received it,I never received this book because it got sent to the wrong address. I didn't find out till several weeks after I ordered it and reviewed the invoice in my email.
3,MY BATH,"The most fun I had with this book was when I dropped it into the bath. Taking great pains to open each page without tearing was great fun. I am sure the book read well, being all about some bloke's life etc... But the impression i got was that this person had a vast supply of self regarding up his own bum claptrap to say."
3,xyz,"Yes. He can write. Impressively at times, as in the book's precious if ultimately crushing first chapter.But the caricaturized self-indulgence of this - his antimemoir - is a one-trick pony. A joke that gets old in a hurry. And one which makes this a spotty read at times.Despite his best efforts to hyper-self consciously torpedo the very pretense under which he's spilling his guts, Eggers is at his best when he's coming clean. Though he hedges the book's bets before his story can possibly overreach itself by employing all manner of cloying device - and even so reveals himself to his reader - the book works best when it is telling its story. Despite his claims to the contrary, the book's story is not in its untelling.Despite its shortcomings, I'd still recommend this book."
3,Wandering & Interesting,"Did I read somewhere that this was the first great novel by a Gen X writer? Maybe so, and it is not a half bad story either. Eggers takes over as guardian to his brother Toph after both his parents die in suburban Chicago. He then moves to San Francisco and tries to do his best to raise his little brother. He gets involved with publishing a magazine, trying out for the real world, killing Adam Rich, and trying not to become paranoid about someone killing his brother while he is gone.At times this book wanders all over the place, but the heart of the story is good. In some ways the tremendously detailed dialogues between him and girls, real world producers, Adam Rich, and others harken back to Russian literature of the 19th century. Now that may be a stretch but I have not seen any other young writers doing this with any humor. Eggers is funny. This book is worth reading. BJoseph Dworak"
1,"Seriously, how did this junk ever get published?","I read all the raving reviews and ran out to buy the book. I think I might have mistakenly picked up a book in an alternate reality.The book was long and boring and I've never heard such pointless rambling in my life.If you want to read about death and mourning, try the obituaries in your local paper; They're more enlightening and far more engrossing."
5,"Amazing, funny, and honest","This is a book that I would rush to read, waiting to see what next new thing Eggers would surprise me with, how else he would make me laugh, make me think.This is definitely not a book that will be palatable for everyone.Even for a memoir, it is very reflexive. But that's what sets it apart from other books.I am a big fan of Eggers, and if you enjoyed You Shall Know Our Velocity, you WILL love this book as well."
3,Oh my goodness! Where to start?!,"Whew! This book is something. It is both wonderful and horrible at the same time. It is wonderful in that Dave Eggers CAN really turn a phrase and be hilarious, poignant, amazing. The story in itself is interesting and touching, but within the story there is so much gnat-like noise writing by Eggers, (necessary perhaps to get a sense of his general character?), but nevertheless compoudingly maddening. I had to put it down after the REAL LIFE interview because I literally couldn't take it anymore. Like a train wreck, however, I was drawn back. This book certainly has energy (hyperactive energy), but not the kind that will appeal to everyone. Much better memoirs to me are The Tender Bar by J.R. Moehringer or The Liar's Club by Mary Karr."
3,"interesting, but not enough so","Eggers is bursting with creativity, but he is not a very talented writer. If this were a movie, I would tell you to wait for the video. Since it is a book, I'm telling you to borrow it from the library. It is worth skimming, particularly the preface, which is actually the most interesting part of the novel, but I have a sense that this one won't be going into the annals of great literature. Eggers' voice is angry, self-absorbed, and often whiny. The book is entertaining, but you probably won't come away having learned much, and neither, it seems, has Eggers."
4,Excellent...I want to meet Dave Eggers (and his brother),"First of all, the title grabbed me. I thought, ""how conceited can he be? Is he being sarcastic?"" And then I thought, ""of course he's being sarcastic, and I'm going to love this book if this is his sense of humor."" Ironically, it doesn't begin with the humor I had expected. But this story grows on you! I feel as if I've known both Dave and his brother, Toph, all my life. What a remarkable talent...to write so clearly to the reader...to provide such a connection. I didn't want to the book to end. I can only hope that Dave writes another."
3,"Enjoyable, but somewhat disappointing","I had a lot of expectations going into this book--some of them were met, some were not. From what I had heard about AHWOSG, I expected a book that was so funny, emotional, and amazing that I would recommend it to all of my friends. After reading this book, I'm not sure that is the case. As predicted, there were definitely parts that I enjoyed, and parts where I actually did laugh out loud. However, there were also parts that I wished I could skim through. I admire the relationship Dave Eggers built with Toph, and reading about his struggle to find a balance between brother and parent is, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of this book. However, wading through other parts of the book was often tedious, which was disappointing. Unfortunately, this is one of those books that received so much hype, that it was almost impossible for it to live up to all of my expectations."
2,I'm 21 and can't identify with him,"As the introduction states, some people should read up to chapter four and stop. This is excellent advice. The first four chapters are fresh, funny and very manic. After this point in the book Toph drops out and around page 150 you realize: HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIMSELF FOR THE REST OF THE BOOK. Unfortunately the narrative becomes overwhelmingly self-centered and juvenile. Was very turned off by his attitude. If the first four chapters could be released in a (much cheaper) novella format, I would have felt like I'd gotten my money's worth."
3,"Emotionally evocative, but wordy","I bought this book because of all the rave reviews from critics and the because it was a Pulitzer finalist. I read the first one-third of the story and really enjoyed his candid writing style. I am from the Bay Area and too lost my mother at an early age, so I really related to both his accounts of Berkeley/SF life and people, as well as grieving the loss of a parent at a young age. His anger toward the insensitivity of others was frank. His urgency to protect his little brother from the realities of death and loss are memorable. His writing style is both vivid and candid, however very very detailed. At first this was interesting and kept my attention, but after the first 5 chapters or so, was a slow moving book. I found myself skipping chapters. Overall a decent read though."
4,Still one of my favorites,"Everyone can relate to the writing of this book. Expecially, the Generations Exers that grew up in the midwest. The story itself is tragically hilarious and entertaing. But it's the way that Eggers writes that really grips the reader. Everything that he talks about is something that can related to in some form.A true enjoyment to read."
5,it really is....,"a heartbreaking work of staggering genius. it is difficult to describe what captivated me about this book because there was very little that didn't. it didn't hurt that it was set in my childhood home, Berkeley, and that it's cultural references are those of my twenties. that aside, his writing is both honest, direct and humorous and he has few of the overwrought displays of genius that are found in most great contemporary literature (a la Salman Rushdie, John Irving, et al.). this book has forever claimed a place on my bookshelf and is among the first books i recommend to friends and family looking for something to read. i am purchasing all his subsequent works today on the strength of this book and look forward to reading his works for many years to come."
4,I should have written it!,"Except he did it better than I ever would. It didn't break my heart, nor do I believe it is a genius work. But what a great piece of writting! Witty, funny and yet moving, Eggers echoes our twentysomething hearts (what a sad cliché...). And although his circumstances were unique, the way he lived and thought about it reflects how most of us feels (or at least the manic-depressive, paranoid and/or neurotic - which encompasses, save some mistake, most of us all).Now I know I am not the only one angry..."
4,If only I could write like this...,"... and my life was less mediocre, for that matter...Dave Eggars writes what many of us twentysomethings feel and sometimes think (or at least the manic-depressive, the paranoid and the neurotic - which probabbly means everyone), the anger and the caring. Only, he does it better."
3,"I wanted to love it, really....","This was a very mixed work. I really, really, really wanted to love it, but... Well, to be positive, the first part was near genius. Egger's family situation is geniunely interesting,and, perhaps, a little heartbreaking. But in the second half, he really starts to wear on you. There's only so much Gen X self-examination one can stand. Over all the work is written very well, it's paced well, the characters are great, his story is funny, intriguing, and interesting. By the end though, and I know this makes me sound as heartless as possible, I was throwing down the book yelling, ""STOP WHINNING ABOUT YOUR DEAD MOM!"" Anyway...if you are you looking for a fairly easy read that is still a piece of litertaure, AHWOSG is worth the time, but it certainly isn't without it's flaws."
2,I was TOLD this book would be good,"I chose this book to read for my summer reading book because my teacher praised it and said it was one of the best books he has ever read. I picked up this book thinking ""Okay...this HAS to be good because he said so."" Sadly, he was wrong. I found parts of this book enterating (the first chapter) and other parts sleep-boring. The worse part was the Real World chapter and how it dragged on and it seemed to never end. There can only be one word to describe Mr. Eggers' life, and that would be messed up."
5,Here is a picture of a stapler:,"First of all, this book doesn't really have to be read like it's true. I mean, because the tone is so depressing and heavy at times (but in a good way), it's easier to read this book as if it were a novel. So even if you generally don't read non-fiction, this book is worth a try. I liked almost everything about it. Stylistically it is great. It has a perfect blend of wit, insight, and sillyness that reminds me of a They Might Be Giants CD. And Dave is brutally honest about his life and thoughts, even when they're not flattering to him. Augustine's Confessions is the only other book I have read where the autobiographer is so forthcoming about his shortcomings and struggles. (Did I really just compare Dave Eggers to a Saint?) Well, read the book and decide for yourself whether you think Dave deserves Sainthood (I think it's a no...). But he does write one heck of an entertaining book. So read it soon. And read it often."
2,"Stick with McSweeney's, pal...",Eggers' autobiographical monolith is an obscenely overrated exercise in literary masturbation. Numerous witty turns of phrase are smothered under a landslide of fake self-mockery as very real (and intolerably boring) self-aggrandizement. A good month in the hospital spoiled.
1,Most Hyped Book of the Year,"Literature is dead, and while Eggers might not have killed it, he his happily dancing on its grave.The book makes no attempt at anything, and it falls short. First are the acrid, gross descriptions of his mother during cancer, with snot running out of her nose. Then there are the chapters where Eggers is heading out in Berkley, looking for someone to touch his private parts.Then there's the five million page MTV interview. And in all of this, there is no recognizable plot, nor memmorable characters. Well I woudln't waste my money on it--I got as a gift from someone who had been duped by the conscienceless publishing/hype industry."
1,"Oh boy, a man who does what women have for years...","Annie Lamott's ""Operating Instructions"" is much more compelling - if you're talking books about single-parenting. Eggers is self-serving and pompous. The book lost me early on."
2,A Self-indulgent Work of Average Intelegence,"After being told that this book was wonderful, beautiful, and lived up to its title I was disapointed. That being said, the author did warn us about this in the labouriously written intro. At the end I found that there were parts of the book that I looked back on fondly but in general I think much of the praise for this novel-ish book to be unfounded."
4,Just a great book.,"Beautiful, touching, smart and funny. But not ha-ha funny, smile while you're reading it funny. Eggers tells the story not so much of the death of his parents, but the struggle to keep it all together afterwards. I found his writing to be light and easy on the surface but very deep if you sit back and think about it. You don't feel forcefed as you do with some authors. He really touches on some very sad things in a way that is not mellowdramatic or boring at all. Its simply just a great read."
2,I Think He Meant Stuttering Genius,"The brilliant title notwithstanding, novelized autobiographies require something more interesting than the death of parents (barely etched at that) to make it interesting. At 22, the author pretends to know more and feel more than other less sexy mortals. The narcissism of this exercise becomes tiresome rather quickly. If Eggers were truly funny, he could have salvaged something. But Eggers is earnest, unflaggingly earnest, ironically earnest. While irony is a useful self-deflation device, Egger's overuse of it is instructive. If you need to mock your own work to defang critics, your issue is approval, not world-weary hipness. Readers might be better steered in the direction of Frederick Exley, whose similar novel/memoir A Fan's Notes is immensely and mordantly entertaining. But then Exley was writing outside the shadow of youth, and the tragedy of his failed expectations rings heroically true. Eggers needs to live a life before he starts writing about one."
2,Patterns are difficult,"This is not like the ""Knit Stitch"" or ""Purl Stitch"" books of Melville's, which I love. I found no patterns that I cared to knit, and few that I felt I would even want to attempt. It's promoted as having patterns that get rid of your stash, but most patterns do this by weaving in small amounts of various colors. You will still need to have large quantities of a basic color for many of these patterns. I will be getting rid of my book, unfortunately. Check this out a library first to see if these patterns are what you like."
4,Use your left overs.,For a person who has knitted all their lives this book offers patterns one can utilise the lovely single bits of wool you didn't want to throw away. One use the background pattern and incoporate any ply for the inserts.
2,A little dated,"I bought this book quite a while ago- possibly a year ago and have not used it at all. I would not purchase it again. None of the patterns were anything I would want to wear, but Sally certainly knows her stuff and if you follow her techniques, you will become a more polished knitter."
3,Strange title. good CD,"Lofty's Roach Souffle is a clear reflection of Harry's New Orleans roots, and is a great mix of bouncy and upbeat and quiet and mellow songs, all presented in a clear and enjoyable format. I recommend it to everybody and anybody who listens to jazz."
1,Just doesn't work,"This unit could have been so helpful to my Mom who has low vision. After I carefully read the instructions and followed all of their tips, this unit was just impossible to program. We tried for several hours but it could not distinguish between different names and continually dialed the wrong parties. What a shame. I am forced to return this item."
4,review vapd,The product works. The voice recognition is adequate but not perfect. The interface with the user is too difficult for an older person and requires assistance from someone with some computer savvy. The instructions should be printed in larger type and simplified.
1,expected more,"Vocal recognition was poor. I had to enter a name many times to get installed. Then ,had a lot of trouble getting voice recognition to put the call though. Apparently you have to used exactly the same tone of voice. My 93 old mother could not do it."
1,Doesn't work,"From out of the box it doesn't recognize a voice, could not even program the first number. Sent it back for and received full refund. Don't waste the money. It cost me $12.00 for return shipping."
5,"Insightful, practical, and easy to read.","Keen & Digrius have written a bible that covers a lot of ground. This excellent book is a litany of other peoples' mistakes - about a billion bucks worth of mistakes! There are checklists of do's & don'ts, many of them not obvious. It's perfectly clear from the book that flaws in project reasoning can be fixed if detected, and well-reasoned technology investments will give you a big advantage in the marketplace.I saw Digrius speak at a Gartner symposium when she was VP at Gartner Group, and the same insight & humor she brought to the symposium sparkles throughout the book. I'd be eagerly awaiting the sequel, but I think they have already covered all the bases."
4,No pump!!,It's an awesome pool. Very durable and lots of fun for the kids. But this model 56420/E does not include a pump. The 56421/E does. So keep a look out for that while browsing. The pool not having a pump included is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating.
1,WARNING: Don't buy it!,"I was looking for an inexpensive pool for the kids and myself to use. I saw other reviews and decided to take a chance with it. My husband and I set it up in about 10 minutes. Took about 2 hours for it to fill. I should have never bought it. After a day, the top ring kept deflating. We pumped it back up and after about an hour it was deflated again. We never found the leak. I believe it is on the seam of the top ring, which you could never fix. It wouldn't be worth the effort to return it because of the shipping charges due to the weight of the pool. Its going in the trash.I will never by another intex product."
5,Kid's Review from my daughter(11),"My daughter loved this book so I thought I would share her review with you:""This book was very inspirational because the protagonist becomes close to God and overcomes his bad conscience.Mr. Upton had Teddy enlist to become a soldier for God and thereby Teddy brought many to Christ.This book is great for all ages."""
3,"For those from Texas, Pat's Music hits home.","Pat Green is a man who writes about life, or what he has seen of it. DanceHall Dreamer is Pat's freshman work and gives the listener a good base for who Pat Green is. I do think that this album is the weekest of his efforts. If you want to get an idea of Pat's real sound listen to him in concert. If you cant make it, skip this album and buy one of his two live cd's."
5,The perfect gospel CD?,"This may well be--top to bottom-- this best Southern Gospel album I have heard! The powerful writing, the superior production and the orchestral arrangements/performance make this a ""must have"" for the Southern gosple fan! There is also a discernable ""realness"" to the voices of the Trio! As a veteran singer of this genre, not since The Cathedrals were in their prime have I heard better spirit-filled music!"
2,"Cleans, but 'Sleek' it isn't","This shampoo works well for hair that is not dry or color-treated. Mine is both, thus 'Sleek' was a bad choice for me. The shampoo is thick and lathers poorly by comparison to the Suave Professionals Almond + Shea Butter shampoo I've chosen to use instead. It rinses, but not well, and left my hair feeling drier and not the least bit 'sleek'.If you have color treated, processed or dry hair, and/or use a flat iron for styling, avoid this shampoo. It's just not moisturizing enough and will leave you with fly-away, dry hair which defeats the 'sleek' look you were hoping for in the first place. It would work OK for kids' hair or perhaps those with normal to oily hair."
1,Several better games to buy,"There are so many negatives to this game and i don't even want to waste my time saying them all. This game OVERALL is a ok game. The ai of your teamates will surely dissapoint, as well as the last stage which is ridiculous.There are many many better games out there to play. If i wasn't determined to beat every game i play i would have cracked this game and threw it out a long time ago"
3,I enjoyed multiplayer,"Single play mode is average.Instead of that, I enjoyed multiplayer.Actually,advanced warfighter is not so'advanced'."
2,A Little Out Dated,"Outdated, graphics are older and the movement of the bad guy NPCs is not all that good. I found the game very unchallenging and too slow paced for me. Except of course the occasional expert sharp shooter from 1000 yards away could pick me out from behind a building...Plus, you have to control three or more support NPCs and that got annoying for me. Couldn't figure out how to turn them off so I just left them behind and had to listen to them calling me waiting orders for most of the game.Also had a problem with setting up the graphics, i.e. the default is set to a resolution which will not play on my monitor. Calling tech support was no help, they said the game didn't support an 8800 GTX? I figured out how to go around it but still wasn't worth it."
5,wow,"wow, I am extremely pleased! one: the game arrived two days after we ordered it (from CA to NC) two: graphics are AMAZING for a 2007 game and three: (a bit of a give and take here) no health shots, hostiles & friendlies die with just a few shots (hostiles have no body armor so they die REALLY fast). however, if you think of yourself as a titan as far as video games go, this one will have you cowering behind walls and letting your squad do all the work. just a few shots and AUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the screen goes red, you fall back and large friendly letter appear across the screen that say: GAME-OVER."
3,"Good, but be careful.","These worked very well, except when the product jammed in the printer. The magnetic business cards are thicker than card & photographic paper, and the feeder had a little bit of trouble with them. Otherwise, we produced beautiful and functional magnetic business cards."
4,Avery Magnetic Cards,I used this product at my company to create inventory tags on various metal shelves. The tags work great and I thought the magnet was fairly strong considering it's thickness and size. I had no trouble printing them at all using a fairly dated laserjet printer. If you use a cheap deskjet with poor rollers it probably won't print correctly. You also should hold both the sides while it's feeding to ensure it's fed straight.A note on the templates: I've never had an avery template in Word that I could just use without making minor tweaks. This one I had to slightly adjust the height of each business card so they were all even. Definitely check first by printing on a thick piece of paper before wasting a whole sheet of magnets.
2,Disappointed,"The first sheet of magnetic cards worked liked a charm. The second sheet jammed in my printer, and I had a terrible time getting it out. It just fell apart. The cards are barely attached to the main sheet, so it falls apart easily. Won't buy this again, wouldn't recommend it."
3,Rather thin,"I love the idea of creating a magnetic business card without having to play around with lining up a printed card on a sticky back magnet. Having the paper already attached to an entire magnetic sheet makes creating the business cards very easy. And like most business card stock I've used, the cards break away from the sheet easily leaving a nice smooth edge.The resulting card is both thin and flexible. Too thin and flexible. It just feels cheap compared to either a regular business card or one that was attached to a firmer magnet. But I guess it has to be this thin in order to get through the printer."
3,Not a strong magnet,I bought these for use on a homemade smoker made from a steel drum to help control air flow. I know this is not an intended use but the words heavyweight made me think they would be similar to the free magnets that are given from businesses to put on your refrigerator or the like. The magnet was extremely weak and would barely hold on a flat surface let alone something curved. If you are looking for something strong enough to hold something down I would look elsewhere.
4,I like how it's pre-cut,It's not too thick to feed through the HP inkjet printers and it doesn't jam even though it's magnetic. I only wish it came in a larger count (say 10 sheets instead of 3 sheets).
2,Not for Advanced Users,"I was disapponted in the lack of options you had with this software. I wanted to make small flash intros and customize small flash presentations. Unfortunatley you can only change the texts and very limited pictures in this software, you cannot change animations and sound. Not what I thought it was by reading the discription."
1,Not worth it,"This isn't worth the money. The ad files are impressive in the first place. You can change text and pictures but not the colors. Being able to change the color would have been a major glitch. Also, couldn't get it to play right when I embedded it with Serif's Webplus X2. Maybe I was doing something wrong. Anyway, I won't be using this product."
5,Very Pleased,No problems at all. Just what I needed. Plugged this in to replace a broken wire and that was all that was needed. My laptop charges without problems.
5,Great,Works really great and is a good length. Arrived as expected and using it many times when I require power.
1,Nothing new or innovative here,"I bought this after seeing several newbie recommendations for it. What a waste of money! This is nothing but a dead trees version of the Win32 API help with some banal examples thrown in for good measure. It's an embarrassing hack of a book. If you want to actually *master* the core API, get Delphi Unleashed or Delphi Developer's Guide and study MSDN extensively."
2,Redundant Work,"After checking out the book for couple hours in the Book store. I realized why some one would want to create a simple Window by writing extensive API code, which takes about 15 lines, when you can do it in delphi by visually creating it (Chapter 1). I was hoping they would cover Windows Messages as opposed to APIs which Borland takes care of them with their wrappers. I personally I find this book neither helpful nor informative at all."
2,Other reviewers must be Ayres' pals,"I'm always embarrassed when I let good reviews of a book pursuade me to buy it, sight unseen, and it proves to be a turkey. Such was the case with this one. I read some good reviews on the Web about it, then clicked a couple of buttons and ordered it online without having really looked at it in a store. What a mistake this turned out to be! This book is a mere reproduction of MSDN and the Inprise/Corel docs. I didn't find the example code helpful or even fresh -- it appears to either be copied from MSDN or directly translated from it. It's a hefty book, but, unfortunately, it's real value to the developer is correspondingly light."
1,A shameless reproduction of the online help,"If you take out the info that is only a mouse click away in MSDN, the Borland online help, the Win32 SDK help, etc., you lose 90% of this book. I can't believe anyone would be foolish enough to give this book 5 stars. A much better work is X Pancheco's book, Delphi Developer's Guide from Sams or Delphi Unleashed, by Charlie Calvert."
2,This is a simple book only !,"I cannot find out for an expert trick or undocumented windows API. I expected more about this book ! Badluck for me :( But , It may OK for some beginner programmer , who know ?"
2,Not what we expected,"This Ankh is definitely of poorer quality than expected. The anhk itself is lightweight, almost like it is plastic coated with silver or silver paint. It is molded, with a mold line around the middle. The ""925"" mark is on the clasp/bail and there is nothing on the anhk itself to indicate that anything other than the clasp/bail is silver.... Not very impressed."
4,Bold Piece,"This pendent shows whatever meaning an Ankh has to you to the world. I often get compliments and questions about it since I wear it everywhere. While the pendent isn't solid, the silver is thick enough to have nice weight to it. The entire piece is real sterling silver (I looped with a 10x jeweler's loop) and won't dent or bend. (My little cousin tried to chew on it once.) So long as you want a bold piece that can be easily seen, this is a good choice!"
2,Looks cool but its hallow and wears bad,Looks cool but its hallow and wears bad. Im afraid it will break easily. Wish it was a solid piece for the price.
4,B-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l!!!!,"this ankh pendant is soooo pretty! the only this is that it is hallow, i found out the hard way and put a dent in it :/ but that should teach me not to bit things! but other then that its really pretty! and i will buy more things from this user."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT/ NOT AN HONORABLE COMPANY!!!!,Product was defective and grey/purple in color. called company and they sent out a new one to only receive the exact same horrible product. company was no help at all. Called Herculiner instead and they sent out a new uv top coat as well as a whole new bedliner kit to fix what the uv topcoat ruined. the one herculiner sent was black in color and was in the new bottle. do not buy from this company until the bottle has a white label or find a company that has the new batch of uv topcoat. as far as I'm concerned their 100% satisfaction guarantee is a load of bs and is not honored the slightest.
4,works great,this product seems to be working great. the only issue that i had with it was that I had to pay more than the original price i was given. i had ordered the product paid for it and then i was charged a different price
3,Becoming outdated quickly,"I have been to various regions in China throughout the last five years and find that much of this book is outdated (esp. in the context of mega-cities like Shanghai). However, the author does give some valuable insight into the reasons for some of the more enduring problems which Westerns have in China. At least it will allow you to be a bit more inspective of your own behavior and those around you.. Do choose a few companion books if you want a well-rounded view of modern China"
5,THIS IS A MUST,"This book is a must for anyone planning on doing business in China or even just spending time there. The author goes into the needed detail of mannerism differences as well as how face is saved and gained. After spending a lot of time in China, I realized that this book actually opens doors.... If I did not learn the correct mindset and mannerisms from this book, I would have been in the dark like some other foreigners I met. I can not stress how essential this book is, it helps to just get by in a society that is so different to ours."
4,Good Value,We go through tons of diamond blades cutting all types of masonry materials. This has become my go-to 12 inch blade. If only I could find such a value in 14 inch . . .
5,The best,This is just simply the best recording ever made by anybody of anything. Buy it. Buy their first album too. Pray for more.
5,Real time- - - Old Time,"Great Ole Time String Bluegrass Music! Highly recommended artists that keep with strictly traditional bluegrass music. No hype, just solid good bluegrass music. Saw them on the Great Mountain Tour and promptly bought the album during intermission. Bear Creek Blues, Hallelujah, & Little Bird of Heaven are my favorites, but none of the tracks will disappoint fans of traditional mountain music. Strong effort from start to finish!"
3,Bought by Accident,"Picked up this book by accident thinking it was another with the same title. Even though this books cover was ""Old Style"" and written in ""95"", really packed a punch with its witty characters and theme. If you find it, give it a try!"
1,Likely Not the Original Recordings,"It appears that most--if not all--of these recordings are not the original hits. I bought it for Wink Martindale's Deck of Cards; but the other tracks that I do know are not the originals, so I doubt if Wink's song is the original radio hit either."
3,eh,"I don't like that they have no options other than buying the 'YBB Squishy Ball' for like the entire ab workout. I'm not sure I like either of the instructors either. But the guy on drums was great, haha."
5,It works!,"People have criticized John Little for ""wanting to make money"" or being too skinny to give bodybuilding advice, but his books are well written and the advice supremely useful. I suspected that his claims about rapid muscle growth from static contraction training was hype, but it is not. It actually does work. I have used his Advanced Max Contraction program for about two months now and have gained three kilograms (about 7 pounds) of muscle - and this after working out for 25 years! That being said, I can see how someone could easily NOT gain using static contraction training. If you train too often, for example, that is what will happen: No gains. If, however, you follow Little's advice to a T, you should be able to experience rapid muscle growth."
5,pure adventure,"Adventure readers will enjoy this obscure (to non-Spanish readers) little collection of four stories. Maqroll has it all: South American hijinks;gold mining in remote jungle locales; lusty love stories entertwined with entertaining storytelling; and two wonderful fellows: Maqroll the Gaviero,a man of ""uncertain"" nationality and his pal Abdul Bashur, Dreamer of Ships. If you like exotic and out-of-the-way ports of call, tramp steamers and unusual characters you will adore this book. Mysteriously enough, look for the very interesting appearance in the book of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a good friend of the writer. Alvaro Mutis is a well thought of Colombian writer who lives and works in Mexico, D.F"
4,Nautical No-No's,"This book, with its seventy-nine fun filled illustrated chapters of nautical humor, provides an addition to the technical treatises on learning to sail. It is a ""what not to do and what to do when you have done it"" approach to the education of a sailor. The pen and ink drawings serve to illustrate the subject matter and enhance the humor.The pratfalls that are bound to affect anyone who is new to sailing are described in amusing detail and provide a learning experience."
5,a review,this book turned me on spiritually as well as mentally... the vivid descriptions and believable characters aroused my mind and made me think hard.. i absolutely loved it!
3,B K Starr by Heart,"Another decent cd by Brenda K Starr. Majority of this cd was produced by Ric wake. The standout's on this cd for me are the Ballads, title track ""by heart"" i really love the vocals. ""you touch me ...""is a nice suductive quiet storm track..The uptempo tracks are a mix of newjackswing, pop, and hiphop. I think this was released on Epic, which is why there was little promotion, that trend seemed to follow with all of their releases during this time period.."
3,HISTOGRAM CURRYCOMB EN LA ANEMONE,"Creepy hippie-haired head band, absolutely charming in its period-piece early 70s FAR OUT jamming, man. Some good covers, some even better originals. Murky tapedeck homemade stir-fry stew-fi. Strange and slightly off, you'll dig this album. Like a hole in the head. What a faded decade we made! I was there, in similar beatitude buzzings. Then play on."
4,A special find,"I don't know how wonderful albums like this go out of print, but it's well worth looking for used. Not quite as good as the UVS self titled, but better than ""Rev"", this is a great record with that early alternative sound to it. A few upbeat tracks including ""Special one"" with Kim Deal from the Pixies, but most of it is mellow. Similiar to early Cure or New Order, but most like Velvet Underground to my ears. UVS is one of those secret bands that nobody knows, but everybody likes, and I have probably played every month since 1990."
4,Excellent details on the Continental Army,"Well-written and researched account of the grim days of our country's break away from England. Loads of information and items of interest.However, the book is shown with a nice looking cover, my copy did not have a DJ. Pity."
5,Fun and Useful,"This book stood out to me as I was walking past the Children's Section in the bookstore. I made a mental note to check it out, and then came back to it later. At first glance, it seemed like some childish picture book, but when I sat down and looked through it, I realized quickly that the book had all the information I had researched on pirates right there. Why bother searching through numerous websites and books when the bulk of the information I needed was simply in this one book? Of course, the illustrations and flaps make the book all the better."
4,Good book for any age,"I got this book for Christmas, as I enjoy reading about pirates. I agree with the comment that it leans a little too much on the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but I expect the movies assisted in a great resurge of interest in pirates, so I think it is acceptable to give credit where credit is due.The interactive pull-outs of letters, cards, etc is very enjoyable. I particularly liked the Wanted Poster of Blackbeard. I like how this book doesn't talk down, and while a young kid may not read in too much detail, they can grow into the book and take in all its details over time.Great, fun book."
5,One of the essential cookbooks,The recipes for Potatoes O'Brien and James Beard's Cheeseburgers alone are worth the price of the book.
5,Definative book on American Cooking.,"James Beard was an American master. Where some people are great at art, or music, or religion, Beard's greatness was cooking. His book is a collection of all the classic American recipes used in all regions of the country. There are written an presented in a very well organized and concise way. The depth and breadth of his collection is amazing and a tribute to the greatness of American cuisine and Mr. Beard. ""American Cookery"" is as classic in its own way as Mark Twain's ""Huckleberry Finn"" . From squrriel in Brunswick stew from the south, to entrees from the great restaurant's in Boston, to homemade English Toffee Beard presents American food in a book that is lovely to look at and read, and also comprehensive in its detail. This book is a real joy."
4,Classic story for today's kids,"I read the Melendy series of books by Elizabeth Enright when I was a child. Enright really knows how kids think and what they want!Written in the 1940s and 1950s, they are a glimpse of childhood as it was. Kids go on adventures, ride the bus, attend the circus and concerts - all by themselves. As long as they get home by dinner and remember the family's rules of ""don't talk to strangers and if you get lost, you can always ask a policeman"" - all is well.The Four-story Mistake furthers their stories when their family moves to the countryside. These plucky city kids have to learn all about country life - even simple things like riding a bike are new to them.I bought the audiobook version for listening to on long car trips and my eight year old son loves listening to them at bedtime as well. The audio book reader is a real treat as well."
4,Oldies But Goodies Still Have It,The series of stories starring the Mellandys was one of my faves as a child and now my daughter loves it as well!
3,Not as good as the first of the series,"This book falls short of its predecessor (The Saturdays) both in story line and in length -- this book is quite brief. The children are still lovable and well-written, and the situations are still entertaining.Parent Notes: This book spills the beans about Santa. Also, Rush's language in this book consistently uses replacement-blasphemy. Gosh, gee whiz, gee, darn, doggone -- it's a bit much to expect my first grader to refrain from using replacement swear words after he reads those words dozens of times in this book."
3,Whimsical family magic,"I had this book recommened to me, and while I was familiiar with the author I had never before heard of the Melendy family. This is, I believe, the second book of a quartet, and what a charming one this is! In old-school fashion this brings a sweet-natured family's various adventues to light after they move from the city to a strange house out in the country. There is not what one would call a concrete plot--just a group of four kids who experience incidents. It's all very funny and good-natured, and the Melendy Family worms its way into your heart."
4,Unique,"Was planning a ""potato themed"" birthday party for my teen daughter. I was happy to find a novelty that I could put in her potato basket."
3,Pretty good for the price...,"I think, especially for the price, that this is not such a bad deal. The instructions on seasoning it were very clear and concise and I had no problems with this. The only thing I ran up against is that I have an electric stove and the wok ring that I received with the wok seems too big (the wok tends to wobble around) and the wok sits directly upon the burner (which I don't think it's supposed to do...). I sent an email inquiring about this to the company selling it and never heard back :-( However, with the shipment, they sent a couple of little ""free gifts"" -- I thought that was very nice."
5,Great wok - Great price,"I just recieved my wok and am very happy with my purchase. I swear by carbon steel or cast iron woks. Non-stick might sound good but remember you should never put non-stick on high heat. It burns the coating. Since the point of stir frying is to use high heat and cook fast it seems to me that non-stick is of little use for a wok. (just my opinion)I like the 12in size, it's perfect for 2 people. Seasoning was no problem (I've done it many times over the years) Extra utensils were included (nice surprise). Overall a very nice traditional wok that looks like it will give years of great cooking. How can you beat it for the price. One warning, go buy a pair of good oven mitts. The handles do get very hot. I wanted something that didn't take up much space on the stovetop, so the loop handles were perfect for me.Happy Woking or is it wokking"
3,A Christmas Movie You May Not Remember,"As a child, I remember going to the theatre each year at Christmas time and seeing a different holiday movie. I don't know why I remember this movie more than some of the others I've seen. I don't think it is destined for cult status like A Christmas Story, but there's something about the charm of The Christmas That Almost Wasn't. The grinch-ish landlord threatens to foreclose on Santa's workshop and it's the kids to the rescue. It's the age old Gricnh stealing Christmas with a different twist. I only gave it 2 and a half stars, but I would reccomend it for anyone's holiday movie collection."
5,As great now as when I was 10 years old,"We watched this every year on HBO as kids. I was so glad to finally find it on DVD. I feared it would be a let-down after all these years, but far from it. I still love every minute of it. There are definitely some things in the movie that were believable as a kid which are now just silly, and after all these years of technological advancements the special effects look very cheesy, but that just makes it all the more lovable. It's a wonderful story, and there were several moments where I felt my emotions rise up in my chest. After 30 years I still remember all the words to the songs. Along with Emmett Otter and Rich Little's A Christmas Carol, this is in my top 3 favorite childhood Christmas movies!"
5,An underrated gem!,"This is one of the all time great Christmas movies of all time, yet, it's not known by most people. This makes me sad as everyone should view this heartwarming classic. It will bring a tear to your eye and put a smile in your soul at the same time. The music is great, it's funny, it's charming. See it!"
1,Poor try !,"I thought the book would be more than just short interviews ,most of then english tankers.A rather burocratic aproach of a very interesting teme.If you want something more real, although in a romance,try something by Sven Hassel (his inicial booksLegion of the Damned (Cassell Military Paperbacks)Comrades of War (Cassell Military Paperbacks)). Of course the german side ,but great in equipament ,tatics and every day life in ""panzer war""."
3,Mixed Bag,"My two boys, 7 and 10, love this set for it's fun racing quality, but initial assembly requires an adult or detail-oriented older child as it's many, many parts. Some parts seemed to be missing and one controller isn't working very well. A cool toy, but don't expect perfection."
2,And when the car breaks?,"Note that unlike some ordinary slot car systems, nobody sells single cars or accessories. Our experience was that the tiny cars are temperamental. Fluff gets in the cogs. We were able to extract a hair from one axle but the second car failed completely (on day 2). Our options now are either to send the entire complicated package back or hope that a retailer decides to sell cars by themselves, so we can buy a replacement vehicle.The giant 'parking structure' is well designed and assembles nicely. The cars whip through it easily enough except at junctions, where we found it very hard to steer one way or the other. Steering is quite a skill, beyond younger kids for sure. We ended up redesigning the track to not use the junctions.Bottom line: relative to its exciting appearance, X-Trek was disappointing. Two weeks after Christmas, it's in the unused heap."
2,Steering is impossible!,"I was exited when I bought this and after2-3 hours of setting up I finally put the car on the track, when I tried to turn the car started doing donuts (like a 360) so then I slowed down, still doing donuts, I just barely turned the car and nothing, I'm so dissapointed..."
2,Archos 604 stand-up case,I bought this as a gift. The recipient told me that the back of the closure snap scratched his Archos 604 Wifi to the point he returned it for a new one. I am very disappointed in this product.
5,Magellan External Antenna,Excellent addition to your Magellan GPS System. Increases reception considerably in areas where trees and building can cause interference driving down the road. This antenna improves the signal strength and keeps the GPS from hunting for satellites less often.
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT ANYWHERE FROM MAGELLAN!!!,"I've purchased this product from Amazon (returned it) and then tried to purchase this same product from RadioShack (returned it). I've fallen into that same trap that some other reviewers have stated in the past. The old ""AT-65 ANTENNA"" switch game. I've talked to people from Amazon about this before I made my purchase for the antenna and they promised me that this problem was taken care of (YEA RIGHT!!!). When I received it from Amazon, I got the switch. The same thing happened with RadioShack. What I can't seem to understand is ""WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD THEY GIVE YOU INSTRUCTIONS ON THE BACK OF THE BOX FOR THE CORRECT ROUND ANTENNA AND PLACE THIS CHEAP AT-65 SQUARE ANTENNA IN THE SAME PACKAGING. OH, don't let me forget to tell you that they are charging customers for the round antenna price and in some cases not refunding them for shipping and handling!!!"
1,Another AT-65 substitution,"Unfortunately, I too received a switched item (at-65)in a sealed Magellan box today. Jennifer in Customer service assured me that they will refund the purchase and that they will investigate the stock they have. She was very apologetic and helpful. I will see what happens but am thankful that she was there to help."
1,another fraudulant AT-65 antenna substitution,"I too just (Nov. '06) got the fradulant substitution of an AT-65 antenna made in Taiwan for the 980637 Magellan antenna supposed to be made in Mexico. The package was the correct package from Magellan but the antenna inside the package was the fake. Called Magellan and they said essentially that's what you get for ordering from Amazon. Called Amazon and at first they offered to send me another one. When I asked how they would ensure they didn't send me another fake since other people have complained of the same thing, he said that i should just send it back and they will refund my money. This has been going on for months!!! BAD AMAZON for not fixing this."
1,Magellan 980637 External Antenna,"The item you sent twice does not say Magellan or 980637 on it any where and it does not in any way resemble this antenna as advertised on the Magellan web site nor one that I looked at in a local store which was the same as the one on the Magellan site. The Magellan site antenna is round and what you sent to me is square. I gave up trying to find out from your customer service department why the antenna you sent as a Magellan 980637 External Antenna is not what is shown on the Magellan site nor does it have any markings on it indicating it is a Magellan 980367. The picture you show here resembles the Magellan, not what you sent to me."
1,AT-65 Substitution,"Got this antenna from my wife for my birthday; to go with my Roadmate 760 I just purchased.. The antenna we received was the AT-65 antenna. Instead of the large round antenna in the picture it was a small rectangular antenna (1 inch x 1 1/2 inch) with no indication that it was an actual Magellan antenna, on the unit itself. The package had a Magellan cardboard insert but this was definitely not the antenna pictured."
1,This product does not work,"I would not recommend this product. It does not work. Even using three times the concentration, this product does not work. I purchased this product because at their recommeded dosage, it seemed like a good deal. How wrong I was. Next time, I'll just pay for Round Up, the $34.00 for one quart. Round Up does work."
5,Excellent and Precise Massage Instruction,"I purchased this video because it was at least $20-30 cheaper than other swedish massage videos. It turned out to be wonderful and provided all the essential massage instruction that is taught in schools. The teacher is a professor of massage and gave the lessons as so. It was very easy to follow and an easy viewing with the original sitar music that was added throughout. The close-ups and angles made viewing each stroke and method really easy to understand. Overall, I would definately recommend this video to massage students, and anyone learning to give professional swedish massages, while saving a good amount of money."
1,Disturbing and Disappointing,"I found this book very disappointing. I have had Crohn's Disease for 17 years and have read all the books on Crohn's Disease. I found this book very disturbing because in many instances, Dr. Gomez claims that when the Crohn's patient ""cleaned"" up their life, they became well. This not only implies that it is somehow the patients fault for getting ill but also that they can control it. Unfortunately, the disease does not work like that. I feel sorry for the Crohn's patient who reads this book and thinks that all they have to do is take their medication live on the straight and narrow."
3,Medical Information,"This book has complete information on the different types of medical treatments for Crohn's Disease. It was helpful to understand the technical side of available treatments,including side effects."
1,Patronising and light on for real info,"I found this book very patronising, just do what you are told and you will get better. Very light on for details of any type. I would recommend Saibil if you just want the mainstream medical info. If you want alternatives to use either with or without maintream medicine try Atkins Vitanutrient Solution (yes the diet guy) or Berkson's Healthy digestion the natural way. They both offer a wide diversity of alternative treatment"
4,Good leather and well-made,"Just what my wife, a dedicated collector of purses, wanted. She likes the convenient way the pockets are laid out."
2,Good but expensive !,"The cards are good quality but the design of the cards is ordinary. The little booklet inside is not explaining enough. I got the cards, but I don't know how to analyze them. And the price is too expensive in comparison with other beautiful Tarot Decks which are very good quality and which include a real book and nice cards inside."
5,"Great, Great, GREAT","This is an awesome album. Pat Green live, what is better. With the re-introduction of ""Nightmare,"" also on ""Live at Billy Bob's,"" this album is just very complete. He sends you through damn near all the human emotions possible. As he picks you up with ""I Like Texas,"" he slowly brings you down to Earth for his great performance of ""If I Had A Million."" This CD is awesome..."
5,Jennifer O'Neill rules!!,Jennifer O'Neill rules as a clairvoyent who finds a skeleton in her husbands home and trying to find the reason how it got ther!!It's a must see!!
4,One of Hiroshima's best,"Providence by Hiroshima is a must have for any Hiroshima fan. Some of the songs with vocals have forgettable lyrics, but no complaints about the quality of the female lead singer's voice. Fans who have seen Hiroshima in concert may recognize one of their touring staples, Turning Point which showcases June Kuramoto's incredible talent on the koto. Kazen is a more traditional koto composition that blends nicely into the amazing Autumn Moon, which could be the soundtrack to a Japanese horror story; it's very ominous and forbidding. Also interesting is the group's treatment of Stevie Wonder's Ribbon in the Sky. Overall, this is a very enjoyable CD. Some amazing songs, some forgettable, but one of their better efforts."
1,this is no blackheart man,"I saw Bunny in august of 1999 and it was one of the best shows I have ever seen. He promised a new cd soon. Here it is eighteen months later and I am speachless. I have been a Bunny fan for years, and I can't believe how bad this cd is. At the show he talked of his roots and getting back to them, what happened? Don't get me wrong, I love a lot of his stuff, but if you are looking for some roots reggae, keep looking. If you are looking for techno-reggae with supermario sound effects this is your bag. I'm not kidding, you will actually here mario and game sounds! May I suggest that you check out Culture's new album instead, this is by far a lot better. Thanks for listening, I hope this helps, I am still in shock. Paul"
1,Disappointing,"Bunny has often been described as a legend with a great voice, and criticised for inconsistent songwriting. Unfortunately, only the latter is evident in this release. Fiya Red and Reggae Converts are two very good tracks, but the rest of the album is comparable to his Marketplace album in terms of quality.Pass on Communication and buy Blackheart Man instead. Or, buy a used copy of Rootsman Skanking or Liberation. Those CDs should never have gone out of print- they are excellent. Hard to find, but they come up on the auction websites from time to time and are very well worth the effort spent finding them."
3,I know the background so was interested to read but a great book,I am quite familiar with the characters and contect of this book so I was interested in reading when I found out about it. It was generally factual with what I am sure was some embellishment but not a great read inho. I give the author credit for trying anyway.
2,Too expensive cost / page,"I found Reichheld a great influencer in the area of Loyalty, but this paper is a kind of scam, it is announced as a 4pges paper but if you buy one you will obtain only 1 page of real content, the other 3 are Front page, shorth bio of authors and link to other materials of HBR...(...)."
4,Journey to Mindfulness review,"I've read this book and, as would be expected from an auto-biography, it's a history of this man's life. His basic Buddhist teaching is in other books (such as Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness, Mindfulness in Plain English, and Beyond Mindfulness in Plain English); this one is just what happened with some thoughts from the author about various events. One thing that's clear from it is that any large organization has 'lifers' who are primarily there for what they can get out of it and they simply don't really live up to the tenets of the organization.This book is useful to read altho hardly necessary for understanding his other books. It's a slice of life book and succeeds at that. I liked it and am glad I read it."
3,Compilation of Worldy Accomplishments,"This is an interesting glimpse into the real world of one Buddhist monk, some Buddhist organizations, and frequently the shortcomings of some of the people in those organizations. I had hoped to learn more about Bhante Henepola Gunaratana's spiritual development and insights in hope of finding inspiration and ideas. Instead, the book seems to be more of a detailed listing of the author's accomplishments. There are several humorous anecdotes, but most of the stories describe bad behavior by Buddhists and non-Buddhists, which, although interesting, were subtly depressing to read. Gunaratana's candor is admirable, but I wondered how someone who gives their life to serious practice of Buddhism can be so quick to act in anger, and there seems to be an underlying fascination with worldly things, especially travel and sight-seeing. Read as an interesting autobiography this book is good, as a book related to spiritual themes, it is disappointing."
5,Interesting and lively,"I liked this biography a lot. Bhante has a personal and honest style of writing and is aware of Western sensibilities. He comes across as someone with a vision, stubborn, fair and who knows a lot about his own tradition. I liked the teaching stories - though I'm sure those familiar with his teachings have probably heard them before."
4,Buddhism's CEO,"This is an American success story. Bhante G. started out as a a boy monk who was born in a poor village in Sri Lanka. When he grew up, he got a Ph.D. He started a legendary monastery. He became the Chief monk in North America of his sect. He rides around in cool cars and sleeps in palaces He uses the latest G4 laptop. And, he returned to his village with a hero's welcome. Bhante G. says that this is the fruit of his karma in this life and in past lives. He has written many books. He has appeared on Larry King. He has given retreats and taught in Universities in every part of the world.I was interested in Bhante G.'s spiritual growth, but I didn't learn very much about it in this book. I did learn that he has decided not to pursue enlightenment in this lifetime.Overall, it was very interesting. I read another book about a CEO and I am going to write a report about how they are similar."
5,Kids Around the World Play,"Excellent book!!! Has origin of game, history, example of game, how to play, pictures, and much more!!! Readable."
2,"Long on behind-the-scenes, short on recipes","This book is suitable for a relatively small group of folks who perhaps have been to this shop and would like to know the story of the people who work there. The amount of recipes in this book is very small compared to the amount of pages devoted to the people who own/work/etc. in the shop. If you're looking for tea-related recipes, look elsewhere."
2,Tea and Sympathy,"This was one of the oddest cook books I've ever read. The recipes are probably good, but the information about the daily life at the restaurant didn't interest me at all. I'm not a New Yorker and after reading the text, that reads more like the author's journal, I'm glad I don't live in there. Very smarmy.Tea...not bad recipesSympathy...none at all."
2,Misleading advertising,"I am no way implying that the product is bad - I am simply bringing it to people's attention before they purchase this that it is in fact BRAZILIAN portuguese and not European portuguese. Nowhere in this description or on the cover of the item does it tell you this. You have to infer it from the text on the back of the actual case: ""Wondering how to make use of all that spare time on the plane while you're flying to Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, or Brasilia?"" which you cannot see here on Amazon. All of the aforementioned cities are in Brazil. I just think it is wrong of the company not to plainly note on the package that this material is Brazilian portuguese. To me that is a lie by omission."
3,Good basics but takes a little longer than the flight,"It's Ok for learning basics, greetings, numbers, etc. I started listening on my daily commute several weeks before going to Brazil. The flight from Miami to Sao paulo was 8 hours and that wouldn't have been long enough. So unless you're a much faster learner than I, don't expect to learn even the basic greetings ""in flight."""
3,I liked them better 20 years ago,"I loved the original Eight to the Bar. This incarnation is good, but the singers and the songs just aren't as good as the old version."
2,Unclear and poorly written,"In reading this book, I was struck at how complicated the explanations are for what should be relatively simple concepts. The text is often abstract when describing quite concrete subjects. The flow of ideas frequently jumps from one topic to the other, which made it frustrating to read. Finally, the summaries at the end of each chapter are brief at best; it is difficult to go back to a chapter and quickly extract the key points.Like many of us, I am stuck with the book since it is part of the CFA I curriculum. Surely there is a better financial analysis book out there."
3,Pretty good book,My accounting professor recommended this book ... found it to be very useful to get a handle on many accounting principles I was struggling with in my MBA course. What I like the best about the book is that it allows you to et as detailed as you want to get - it all depends on your interest. For instance I just wanted to get familiar with some issues like accounting for pension and it has very well explained the basics of pension accounting and on other hand where I wanted to get into details of handling of stock options it had all the details I was looking for.
1,Horribly written,"I have read this book several times because it was lucky enough to be selected as part of the CFA curriculum. Out of all the accounting texts that I have read, this is by far the worst. I found myself reading and rereading this book several times just to make sense of it, not to mention the fact that I was continually calling upon friends that work as accountants for help. This book even managed to confuse them. I'm sure that there is a wealth of good information in this book; the problem is that you may have to read it five times before you decipher it."
1,Poorly written - a very slow read,This textbook reads like a dictionary. I was looking forward to using it for a graduate level course but I am very disappointed.
2,More useful if it were complete,"This book is not bad, but it's not the best, either.First, a lot of the problems in the book are incomplete (e.g.: they tell you to depreciate an item but don't give you the salvage value). And they also don't give many formulas, but they ask you to come up with them on your own, (e.g. Free Cash Flow). Some of the cases and problems are pretty vague, leaving you to fill in a lot of blanks that are integral to the problem.This book is also becoming increasingly obsolete. (e.g. it was written before SOX.)That being said, the book still gives you a good idea of some the ways you can use the information presented in a company's financials to get a good idea of what's really going on."
3,Took way to long to ship,"I ordered this book right at the start of my semester. It finally arrived nearly 2 weeks later. It was in normal condition, neither great nor bad, but not necessary after the long wait."
1,not understandable,"worst accounting I've ever read so far. It requires knowledge which doesn't make sense for me cuz i think book should provide knowledge for reader. Basically, it doesn't explain a thing. It's not worth for what u pay."
3,Remember The 1st Amendment,"Much of Neil Young's work in this time period was not what people wanted to hear from Neil, so they slammed him. Geffen Records even sued him for not producing ""commercial music"" that was a lawsuit Neil was proud of. As a Neil Young fan, maybe it is because my first concert was his ""Trans"" tour and that's the neil I got to know. Therefore, all his other experiments did not phase me- I changed with him. During this time period he also produced some amazing music that his audience and critics loved. Neil has always been known for doing the unexpected. A new Neil Young record or a Neil Young Concert, you never know what you are going to get. I did not get as angry at this review program as I did at the first version."
1,Nice DVD,"This is a beautifuuly crafted DVD. After viewing it and appreciating the oh so insightfull comments of these laureate critics, place the DVD on your favorite altar or perhaps in your fireplace. Open up your favorite beverage and put on Tonight's the Night, or perhaps Rageed Glory. Douse the DVD with lighter fluid, light, and enjoy. It's beautiful.The way Neil is going, these yo-yos will have to create a third ""Review"" in a few years."
5,Tonight is right for Love (With Meredith Baxter-Birney),"Chef Aid is worth the buy. This very funny record includes ""live"" intros to each song by Chef, not to mention a selection of his greatest hits, like the title above my review, which he performs with Meatloaf. Cartman and the gang join the fun as well, along with Ned, Primus, Rick James w/ Ike Turner, Rancid, Wyclef, Devo, and Elton John? Buy Chef Aid and play it with someone you love."
5,THE BEST C.D. EVER!!! IT IS SOOO SWEEEEET!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This C.D. is the best C.D. ever cuz' it was made by my favorite comedians TREY PARKER & MATT STONE and the show is totally hillarious and the C.D. is just as funny. If you like south park (which I really really do) YOU MUST BUY THIS SWEEET C.D.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Chef Aid: Wonderful for a novelty.,"Well, I waited a while for this CD. It's a lot of fun too, Cartman's ""Sail Away,"" DVDA's ""Hot Lava,"" and a bunch of other pretty good stuff is on here. however, after a few listens, it gets grating, and you might only wanna pull it out to show a friend ""Hey, ever heard..."""
2,"A decent record, fun to hear Ozzy and Ol' Dirty B. together.","When you read the reviews of this CD, you get high hopes. And it does contain some ""charming"" elements. Hearing people like for example Ozzy and Ol'Dirty Bastard together is always amusing. And the lyrics are brilliant too. A shame that only a few of the tunes are good enough to match theese lyrics..."
5,Brilliant,"I really like this cd, as it is not only hilariously funny, but also contains mostly good songs from the other artists as well as Chef, whose brilliant songs were the whole reason i bought it in the first place. particularly good were Rancid's 'Brad Logan', 'Hot Lava' and 'Bubblegoose'. its also surprising how listenable Cartman's 'Come Sail Away' is - i would have thought 5 minutes of cartman singing would be dreadful, but its actually really good. However i really hated that 'Huboon Stomp' song - so much that i have to skip it because its so bad. They should have included Cartman's classic 'German Dance' instead."
5,How can you not like it?,"This is a great cd. It's funny, entertaining and definately different. I mean really, what else can you expect from the South Park gurus? Besides, who can't like Eric Cartman's touching rendition of 'Come Sail Away'?"
1,shocked at lyrics,"As a parent, I was shocked to find that my two daughters had purchased this album. I was especially shocked to hear the Chef's song about chocolate salted balls. What sort of a society are we bringing children up in if these sentiments are expressed, in a gross and offensive manner, to our youth? It was bad enough that SBS in Australia showed 'South Park' originally at 8.00 pm -- yes, 8.00 pm (can you believe it!) -- but to promote promiscuity through the CD is beyond the pale. Why can't record companies promote wholesome themes -- like the thoughts of much of the excellent Christian music that can be obtained today -- rather than disturbing songs about disturbed children? I have listened to the album six times, and each time I have been offended by it."
2,3 piece Starter Kit Sanyo 8300,"The case is very cheap. You cannot use the charger while the phone is in the case due to the way the material is cut.You cannot use the camera features in the phone due to the cut out for the lense in the case material being way off center, covering the lense.Ear plug, ok, haven't used it.Car charger ok. The only thing that makes the package worth buying.Really wanted the case to work right, but it's useless."
5,Great value,This is a great value w/ decent quality accessories. Definitely better than paying 20 bucks a piece for each thing. Don't really use the ear bud though.
1,Very Uncomfortable,"These shoes are very tough and hurt my feet. I'm sorry I bought them. A waste of money as I dont think I can wear them again.Sandra, Florida"
2,Stretch Out,"Shoe is cute, but after 1 wear they streched out so much that I can't wear them anymore. Consider ordering half a size smaller to make up for it."
2,Disappointed - Units stats riddled with typos,"I recently purchased the strategy guide for the EA games title: Battle for Middle Earth II. I was primarily looking forward to the customary (and advertised) information on unit statistics and upgrades etc.Unfortunately the tables that are supposed to contain this information in the book are riddled with typos.- Many units have blanks or dashes instead of the appropriate stats- Many units have letters in columns that should contain numbers and numbers in columns that should contain letters- The unit upgrade information is referenced, but was totally omitted from the tablesIf you are primarily interested in the unit statistics I would not recommend this guide."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I was heartbroken to hear that Trust Company had broken up, but estatic to hear that they were coming back as Amity Lane. I'm going to make this review short: There are a few good tracks: Shutting Eyes, Drown You Out, Million Miles Away. The rest came off as watery and bland. I was hoping for a different style than the old Trust Co sound with just a few similar elements. If you were hoping for the greatness that was Lonley Position of Neutral then expect to be disappointed."
3,Shabbily made,You think that with the high end quality of the Magellan products they would make a mount that would be equal to the quality of their product. You must be EXTREMELY careful when attaching or removing the mount from the window--the connecting arm from the suction cup to the mount is thin and breaks easily. Such a great product(Roadmate 700) what a piece of garbage for a mount(definitely not worth more than $5)
1,Use caution in ordering!,"Although the description said it would work with my model GPS, the item I received was inappropriate and would not work with it. The Amazon Marketplace seller was uncommunicative but fortunately Amazon's guarantee took effect and I was able to get a refund... but not the mount. :("
5,Joyce Meyer CD review,"The cd is amazing! Joyce Meyer is always finding ways to teach us God's word. Her points are well made. In this cd, the lesson is about obedience...hearing God and obeying so that He can lift us higher than we ever could imagine. Believe, trust and know that God will bring us through. God wants to bless His children. We just have to do our part and obey. Thanks again, Joyce for another powerful yet much needed message."
4,Faraway Place,"You will be transported to a faraway place as you listen to Relax With A Walk in the Deep Woods. Natural sounds like singing birds and a flowing stream are beautifully complemented with soothing instrumental music. Good for relaxing at the end of a tough day or for meditating before you begin your day. Induces a sense of calm and well being. Kudos to the ""Relax With"" series. Excellent. Highly recommended."
2,Music on CD Stinks,I hate having music mixed with my nature sounds. I really hate bad music mixed with my nature sounds. Save your money and buy something else that's worth it. THIS IS NOT RELAXING.
2,Not as Peaceful as I thought,"I was hoping to use this cd, to relax or feel at peace, I'm really not sure what it is, but it doesn't fit the bill for me. I suppose I really wanted a cd with the sounds of the woods and this has some music that I really don't find relaxing.There is more music than nature. I was hoping for nature sounds. The music is louder than the nature sounds. And it's at times ear piercingly high pitched - not relaxing to me."
3,Streetwise Downtown Chicago,I have both maps. The Downtown map is only a portion of the Chicago map. It begins at North Ave/North Ave Beach and concludes with Balbo Ave/Balbo Dr [about the middle of Grant Park].Streetwise Chicago [gets 5 STARS] is my recommendation as it is much more complete. It begins with W Irving Park Rd
5,just what expected,"Exactly what was looking for, could not have been better... will get much use out of this product for many years"
2,Practically Useless...for us at least,"We were going to Chicago for tourism. For us this map wasn't very useful because things like the Lincoln Park Zoo, Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium were off the map. If I could do it over I would have bought the regular Chicago map instead of the downtown. Maybe if you purchased both maps the Downtown one would be more useful."
3,"Why isn't ""North"", North?","Generally speaking Streetwise products are amongst my top recommendations for the tourist or newcomer to a city. Like others, this one provides good details about the location of key landmarks, is easy to read, and holds up under exposure to the elements.However, for reasons unknown, the orientation of the map is off by 90 degrees, putting the lake (which is on the east) in what would typically be the ""north"" side of the map. For someone who has a natural feel for where ""north"" is at any time, and has been using normal maps for multiple decades, this makes orienting oneself unnecessarily difficult. I'm sure someone thought they were getting more real estate or something, but that simply isn't true--it is just a question of which way the text is oriented. If they could clean this up in a future edition, they could count on me to buy a new copy."
3,Streetwise Downtown Chicago,Not as detailed as the other Streetwise maps I have purchased at Barnes and Noble. I wasn't aware there were too standards.
1,Piece of Crap,"DO NOT BUY THIS. I just got it and 99% of the time I get ""Cannot Read Disc"". The other 1% of the time when it actually works, it loads EXTREMELY slow. I also called their Tech Support line and it was a wrong number. Do not buy this. It is a waste of money."
4,Don't listen to the critics!,"I bought this item used for under $20 and it was well worth the price. I have so far used this item on 5 different video games and have not received one problem yet. All you need to do is just choose the codes for the game you want to play after being instructed to switch the AR disc with the chosen game disc. It only takes less than a couple of minutes for the game to start with the selected codes which is compared to the hours it takes to complete a single game. The memory card has a mega storage capacity for saving whatever you accomplish in any game. The only drawback is even though it has a ton of codes for many of the games that have been released, I would like to see them add codes for the games that are being released this year. Otherwise, I have no other complaints since, this cheat system has done everything I was hoping it would do and, has saved me a lot of frustration and time. This is a great addition to the playstation 2 console."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH OLDER MODEL PS2s,"I have no idea if this works with the newer, slim-line PS2s, but I know for a fact it doesn't work for the older models. It says it nowhere on this page, nowhere on the box, nowhere in the instruction manual. The only time you find out that the $25 product won't work for you is when you call the customer service number. Not only that, but my system has not worked properly since trying to run the software. If it's worked for some people on here, I'm glad to hear it. But in my personal experience, it's a 100% hunk of junk."
2,Nothing special as a whole,"Not bad music but not music worth spending the time listening to, just pretty mediocre in all respects - Heard much better on street corners - Did not care for but three songs"
5,Jazz Fusion that grows on you with each listen,"I received this cd on a fluke from Robby Krieger himself (nicest guy in the world; didn't realize for a minute that I was talking to a rock legend), gave it a quick listen, and buried it in my collection. That was a mistake on my part. In the years since, I have become more serious about playing music and, specifically, guitar. I've also become a big fan of Jazz Fusion. I put this cd on my iPod a few months ago and have been steadily listening to it since. The songs are tight, the playing is fluid & sweet & full of emotional content (far more impressive to me than speed-of-light shredding), and the songs flow beautifully from one to the next. As mentioned in other reviews, it's all instrumental minus some Morrison drops on War Toad. Any fan of Jazz Fusion, Instrumental Rock, Guitar, etc. would do well to check it out-- and, again, it seems to improve with each listen."
5,Robby Krieger,"This is one GREAT CD by Robby Krieger. I got the cover signed by Robby in 2000 @ the Odeon in Cleveland, Ohio. Long live The Doors!"
3,"In a Word: ""Average""","I feel that I've reached the point where I've heard what most would characterize as an excessive amount of music, and this isn't bad, but at the same time, it just doesn't do anything for me. The songs aren't very complex or original and neither are the vocals or lyrics. The songs are just kind of ""there,"" rather than anything special. I saw that other people bought albums by the likes of June and Cartel and I would say that those bands are both lightyears ahead of this one. Maybe with time they'll get better and find a more original sound, but they haven't found that yet."
4,About a 3 1/2,"Pretty safe and polished pop punk type of band. I bought this cd and found some the older stuff and gave it all a good listen. It is certainly good music. However there is not really a standout track or two that I hear that will make the radio to make this album a hit or bring more attention to this band. They sound as good as a lot of other similar type of bands, but unlike Simple Plan, Blink 182, Sum 41, or Green Daywhich had some great songs in the early albums, Southcott falls a bit short. This one is not the album that is going to get them to the top."
2,Southcott should take their own advise,"""Safe, predictable and generic pop-rock done wrong"". That's what the critics SHOULD be saying about southcott and their disaster of a debut ""flee the scene"", but they're not (surprise, surprise). In this day and age of myspace and purevolume, pretty much anyone can buy themselves studio time and a musicians profile...it doesn't mean you have any talent, which is evident in the case of Southcott. So why don't they take their own advise and ""flee the scene""? Who knows."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Flee The Scene? I hope they're not talking about the generic overproduced commercial power-pop emo drivel scene, because these guys would be lost without it. They're more like Something Corporate and Self Against City than Taking Back Sunday or The Used, so they're not as bad as some other clueless poser stuff out there, but this is still clueless poser stuff. The music is mostly just safe and harmless, as always it's the forced robotic vocals that really ruin it. What this guy does really can't be called singing, it's more like mimicing a clock-radio alarm."
5,Cute and Cuddly Fun,"My daughter received this and loves to play with it. She carries around the cookie tray all the time and enjoys the songs and words from the puppy. Contrary to the other review on this item; the puppy does sing the entire ABC song. As with many toys there is a plastic ""try me"" strip that must be removed from the back of the toy for it to work completely. I think this is a great toy and I plan to purchase for others this Christmas."
5,A Stunning Collection,"Dear jwwaterhouse.com, thank you for finally making a wall calendar that is truly dedicated to my favorite artist! A stunning collection of the masters' work, beautifully illustrated with incredible detail to the originals and exquisite quality. I already have plans to cut out one of my favorite pantings to be used as a poster at work."
5,Great instructional tool!,"Thank you for making such a wonderful collection of the masterpieces of John William Waterhouse. As a Language Arts teacher, I put this calendar on my school shopping list for September. The collection of paintings will serve as a timekeeper, a visual aid for group discussions and journals, and a thoughtful present for co-workers. Recent emphasis on interdisciplinary projects will make it a great instructional tool in combining English, Arts, and History."
5,Fine product,We were looking for a LIGHT WEIGHT hose an older gardener can handle which was durable as well. This product fits the bill nicely.
2,Problems,I bought two of these hoses for RV use. I liked that they stored easily. Within the year one hose developed a pinprick leak and the other a bulge. Hoses were always used with a pressure regulator to protect both the hose and the RV. Went back to using a previous other brand hose which I used now over 5 years.
4,Great for Cattle Shows,Needed a hose to pack to take with to Cattle Shows. This is heavy enough to withstand hoofs standing on it. It folds flat very easily and packs wonderfully!
1,Bad Info Wasted our $$$,"The reviews and info on this game are incorrect.This is a DOS 5.0 gameonly.It will not work with any windows especially WIN 2000 or WIN XP.Both review and stats say it will work in both 2000,ME,95.,and 98SE.It WILL NOT!! One can only use it for a bookend or a collectors piece.Do not buy unless your running a DOS operating system."
4,Super Reader,"A solid Batman story, it only suffers from the fact that it has The Riddler shoehorned in as a second villain, when it does not seem to be necessary at all. This cramps the room for the other characters, who aren't too bad at all. Alfred is Alfred, Chase Meridian is intriguing as a psychiatrist, and the hot headed teenaged acrobat Robin isn't too horrible.Batman here is having problems with these two new people in his life, and his mental state becomes fragile."
3,Big Band or Blues,"Yes a good album, but a bit overproduced. Many tracks sound more like big band rather than the talented guitar blues that Mr. Clarence Brown is renowned for."
4,I like it!,Delivery was very fast. And packing was perfect.Most of all I like this set very much. And the price is very good. I'm very satisfied.
4,Good Price,"Packed well, and shipping was prompt. The set had duplicate designs and the large bowl was like one of the plates. I was hoping for more of a variety. However, the quality was superb. The colors were bright, no scratches or smudges. Great for use or to start a collection!I found the glasses to be a bit small for iced tea, but use as wine or water glasses would be fine."
1,I didn't got what the picture is showing,I was very disappointed when I got. I didn't get the design what I see from the pictures. they are all ugly design which even doesn't show from the pictures. I am going to find out about return policy. very disappointed.
4,Xtreme Air Racing,"A really good air racing game. It only covers the Unlimited class of aircraft, which is disapointing, no biplanes, no jets, no AT-6s, no sportcraft and no small experimental aircraft."
2,Some good stories,"Several of the stories in here were very good. There were a few that were real ""stinkers""; like a rapunzel one where a computer genius escapes his captors by climbing out the window down his ""hair"" computer cables. And there was one that was very foul involving descriptions of very violent rapes. Overall I thought it was an ok read, but not great. I think so much more could have been done with this idea."
5,story draws you in and doesn't let you go,"I can see the Three Kings comparison, but for me this book brought to mind Indiana Jones -- if Indiana Jones weren't Hollywood shlock with the line firmly drawn between good and bad. In Howard's book, you can't tell who to hate and who to feel sympathy for. In other words, the characters are real human beings rather than pretty people meant to play on readers' emotions. The story grabs you, pulls you in, and gnaws away at your insides because the lead character - Maynard - speaks the truth, and the truth is a hideous accident you can't look away from."
1,anything can get published,"i'm not understanding the recommendation letters for this book....i thought that it was amateurish and sloppy. oh well, i guess you can get anything published now-a-days."
4,My book: Enforcing the Peace by Kimberly Zisk,"This book is fundamental in the area of International Peace and Security. Even though it is a book aimed mostly to scholars I think it has a valuable message for all people interested in the reality behind PK.Zisk Marten compares complex UNPKO's to the 20th century Imperial colonialism. These practices are almost the same, but today's colonialism (carried out through PK, among other mecanisms)is sophisticated and justified under new speeches of power under which it is intended to re-create societies based on western values.I highly recommend this book."
3,"Okay, but....","This textbook is good, however, some sections were confusing. I did not always understand the way a problem was worked out in the textbook. My math instructor did not always teach according to the book and for that I am grateful. The author's CD is good and her instructions were clear and concise, but she walks you through select problems only. Not all problems given in the exercises were included in the instructions, so make sure you ask your professor how he or she teaches that particular section."
1,Skip this one,"You'd think with how important it is to understand each step in solving a math problem, that a math text wouldn't skip any.Not so! This book routinely skips past steps. You'll find signs flipped, things factored, and numbers changed with no explanation.You sometimes end up with an answer that is technically the same as what the book's example has, but signs will be flipped in the book. Sometimes the answer is completely off, and it's because you followed the book's incomplete instructions. It's like they never handed this book to someone who doesn't already know everything in it before putting it up for sale.Skip this if your course gives the option.edit:This is based on the 4th edition, but given the nature of the textbook publishing industry, the 5th edition is probably the same book with a new cover."
3,Pretty good.,Comes with good condition.Nice cover.But not sure for teaching english with this book.It has good reviews but I think it depends on students not for teachers.
5,A++,A+++ awesome service! sent a email saying i needed it by Saturday and received it 4 days earlier!book is in very good condition!!!
3,You did a great job!,Thank you so much for having college books for half the price. We didnt find out about you until the weekend before my son started college. They didnt get here on time so i did send them back. But we will get on the ball and get our order in ontime next time.Thank you so muchSharon Battin
1,wrong item,"Speedy transaction, however, I contacted seller as to return policies as this item was incorrect and I would like to return."
3,No headers with movement titles,"I love this piece, and this score is decent if you're just singing or playing through the piece, but it's frustrating if you don't know the piece very well because it doesn't have helpful headers or footers with the movement names on it. This is common in earlier Dover scores (I have a few with them but most do not have them), but at least this particular score does have measure numbers, which are VITAL if one is trying to rehearse a piece.IMHO, all musical scores and parts should have measure numbers, so this score lucked out that it does, or else it would get only one star."
4,IF I SHOULD DIE BEFORE I WAKE,"Author:Lurlene McDanielsThis story is about a girl named Deanne who mother wants her to work at a country club so she can work with the right people. The problem is she wants to volunteer at a hospital her father works at. She gets a job there and meets a boy named Matt, who has canser. She gets real close with Matt, who has cancer,but she gets scared he might die. So she find out that working at a hospital can be sad."
5,love these flip-flops,these are my favorite flip-flops! simple and very comfortable. fit nicely and are narrow for a woman's foot.
5,Awesome flipflop,The strap in between the toes did bother me at first and I was very disappointed but after wearing them a few times I did work them in. Very very comfortable flip flops and that is coming from someone who is very picky about the comfort of their shoes.
4,Cute flops!,"These flip flops are comfortable and cute for casual wear. The flower pattern underneath the strap and slightly higher than normal heel were the main reasons I purchased it. They worked out great for my Hawaii vacation - was able to take them to the beach and for strolls around town. However, they do run a bit narrow and small. It was fine for me only because I have small feet. I would recommend ordering a half size larger."
4,Victorian Cyberpunk?,"A very good book if you are interested in the late Victorian origins of science fiction. Also for those interested in the mini-genre known as 'steampunk'. This is a story about terrorism, technology, and anarchy written over a hundred years ago. On the surface it seems very similar to much of Verne's work, (Hartmann the Anarchist is a madman who builds a huge airship which he uses to bomb major cities all over europe) but the book goes much deeper into the political motivations of the character, and contains an intersting dialogue between the underground socialist and anarchist movements in the 1890's. I'm sure it was a radical novel at the time, but went largely unnoticed."
2,More than wolves,"Unfortunately, this cd contains much more than wolves. The evening crickets and songbirds are lovely, as are the howling packs of wolves and the wind rustling through the trees. But the background muzak destroys the sounds of nature, as does the microphone echo. Skip it."
4,good read,"Nic and Lauren was somethong else she kept fighting his love, while he kept fighting for their love. The book was good, Lauren had a problem with accepting love in her life, because every man she ever loved died( father, fiance). Nic was attracted to Lauren from the very first day he met her, but they got off to bad start in the hospital room of a mutual friend. Lauren decides to take a trip before she is 30, and get married to a man who will keep her company, thru manipulation, of her best friend and Nic her plan is delayed, she ends up renovating Nic's home while falling in love with him at the same time. This book was nice i hope we here more from Nic's family in the future they were a riot act, laugh out loud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Boring..................,This book was bland and dull. Lauren wasn't an interesting character and Nick wasn't much better. Ms. Weaver never made their attraction to one another believible. Why was Nick attracted to Lauren? Why after months of not even speaking to Nick did Lauren suddenly fall in love with him? Well after reading the book I still can't answer these questions.This is my second book by Ms. Weaver and my last.
4,good,it was good till i got to the ending it was very predictable what was gonna i liked it happen afterwards
4,Good,"Alex is a teenage who is HIV positive. Not many people want to be around him. This book shows the hardships that Alex has to go through. This book also shows how he has to deal with certain things. A boy named Clinton is one of Alex's worst enemies. Clinton hates Alex a lot. Can Alex turn Clinton into a friend and not an enemy? Read the book to find out.**** I liked this book very much. This book shows what a person has to go through if they are HIV positive. I enjoyed this book very much. ****Brandon Stabler, 14 years old."
5,Princeton Review - A Win!,"I began studying for this test only one week before (I know, I know). I managed to page through most of the book and take the practise tests (which by the way were more difficult than the actual test), scoring 28s and 29s (with low scores of 20).However, come test day I convinced myself that I could do better. Afterwards, I felt that I performed about the same as when I took the practises. A few weeks later, my result was a score of 32! (English: 35, Math: 30, Reading: 32, Science: 29)What helped me the most was PR's advice on approaching the science section. When I took their practise tests I was scoring 23s and 20s in the science section, and it was significantly decreasing my composite score. Therefore, with the help of their science section techniques I received a score of 29(!) on the June ACT.I would use this book again if I were to retake the test."
4,Good ADvantage,The comprehensive material and timed tests made us feel like we had an advantage this second time we took the ACT. Felt like the real thing.
5,Cracking the ACT,The book seems to be very helpful for my daughter. She is retaking her ACT and is more confident than the first time.
3,Followup,"I wrote the ""Kid's Review"" below. I got a 31. Don't think that this was solely due to the book alone. I would have gotten a 33, but the Reading Section Review of this book was absolutely worthless. It doesn't help whatsoever on the exam. For me, it would have been better to just read the passages instead of ""skimming"" them as PR suggests."
1,Flaming Buffet Surver,"We used this product once - and nearly set the kitchen on fire. The tea lights that came with this product flamed wildly around the server, and blackened the bottom almost immediately. When I contacted the company they said they would ""pass it along"" to management. So I'm ""passing it along"" to the most important people - customers. Heads up!"
5,Cuisinart Server,This is a gorgeous and elegant item. I like that it can be cooked in and keeps food warm while entertaining.
3,Ok server but does not keep foods warm for very long,"I bought this to use primarily as a server, not to bake in, and for that it looks quite elegant. There are two slight negatives worth knowing. First, the dish does not fit firmly in the wire rack. There is about 1/4"" clearance on the sides so the dish slides around a little when someone spoons food out of it. The second drawback is that those small ""tea candles"" do not put out nearly the amount of heat a can of Sterno does, so your food cools down fairly quickly. It's ok for rice or noodle dishes but those with cheese may start solidifying quicker than you would like. Leave such foods warming in their cooking pan until ready to serve."
5,Wow your guests!,"I am SO SO pleased with the Cuisinart Oval Bufet Server! A friend suggested that I look for these to ""complete"" the look on the table for my upcoming Christmas Party. So I looked on the Internet and compared the prices. Amazon was having a 4 for the price of 3, plus free shipping!Needless to say, the buffet servers looked great, especially when arranged at an angle. And they were extremely useful at keeping the food warm during the colder weather. And the compliments I received were music to my ears.TIP: The food keeps warm longer if you actually cook in the serving platter before setting it on the server rack.My fav things about this product are that it uses tea lights which are easily available, has a large capacity and a clear glass lid that makes browsing easy without any unneccessary heat loss."
4,Practical and good quality,"The server is both practical and versatile. It's quality allows one to use it for a formal occasion as well as an informal one. I would recommend it without reservations, but would remind everyone that it is not a chafing dish; however, I am considering finding a casserole dish that can fit inside the pan which can be used as a steam pan, thus creating the effect of a chafing dish. Very much worth the price paid."
3,If You Cook In These They Make Great Servers,"These servers hold heat well if you cook/bake in these before placing them on the stands with the tea light candles. However, if you cook in another vessel and then pour the food into these servers, you will have cold food in no time, even if you keep the candles lit the entire time. If you would like servers with better heat retention, I recommend purchasing traditional chafing dishes that come with a water pan."
5,Perfect: Great for Cooking and for Keeping Food Warm,"I got this last week and used it for a party tonight, cooking seitan stroganoff in the pan. It was just the right size and conducted heat really well (throughout all the different heat levels required for this rather elaborate dish), without hot spots. I put it on the holder with the tea light candles at about 6:15 where it stayed warm at exactly the right temperature until after 10:00 when I put the candles out. Washing it was a breeze. I love it and would recommend it to anyone who entertains or who would like to keep a dish warm through dinner."
2,Don't bother,"Its a decent amp but theres so many design flaws. the inputs are slanted down so occasionally the wires will fall out, in fact my ground wire fell out some how and blew the 35a fuses. Oh and if you blow a 35a fuse good luck finding a replacement thats not online."
1,Bad out of the box,"Unfortunately for me I had to pay best buy to install it twice for nothing. I ordered the first one, a best buy tech installed it and the 2 front channels were shot right out of the box. I asked for a replacement which came right away (I really liked that) but to my amazement it was another lemon. Sent it back and got a refund as soon as the bad amp got there. To me it was a bad experience and it costed me $180 between the two tries to install plus the cables."
2,A Shallow Stream,"This wildly overhyped book leaves one embarrassed for the author. It isn't about 'Father Joe' at all, but about Tony Hendra. Neither is it an autobiography, but akin to what Mauriac called ""memoires interieurs'. But though an immensely talented and distinguished man, the author swims in a shallow stream of self. Not very interesting."
5,Incredible! An utter and complete masterpiece,"Tony Hendra has captured the essence of purity, joy, and happiness. Through his awesome words he captivates the reader inside his book. I sat down to read Father Joe one day and it seemed that it had only been 5 minutes before I was at page 80. This is a masterpiece that I and surely many others cannot put down. A nostalgic and hilarious book, Hendra seems to be able to make the reader cry. Adam Gopnik did and so did I. I would recommend this book to the intellectual and to the average Joe. Hendra has captured my heart like Father Joe did to his, and turned it into gold. What a book!"
1,What Soul ?,"This book is not about Father Joe. It is about a bad boy and later a not so very nice man who writes a book in an attempt to profit economically from his relationship with a wonderful individual. Unfortunately, not a lot is said about Father Joe. So don't look for any spiritual guidance.How many people do you know who would describe an individual they care about as having floppy ears, rubber lips, etc.? He also takes his licks at President Ronald Reagan and PM Margaret Thatcher. This guy is sick, but has found a way to make a living at being sick.I question whether Mr. Hendra's soul has really been saved. In my opinion, he has a long way to go."
4,Father Joe,"An absolutely wonderful read. It is quite well written and written from the heart. An often humorous coming of age story... even if the coming of age is middle age for some of us. Touching, human - a wonderful feeling study of the author's spirital quest. A tribute by an intelligent/intellectual man to his deeply loved mentor. I suggest folks not be put off by the concern this is a religious book... it is beyond this. The book encompases stuggles many, if not all of us have in some manner/degree in the hurley-burley of today's world. Take some time, explore what this delighful author is saying and explore his relationship w/his stuttering, insighful, big eared friend on the Isle of Wight."
5,A book for the ages,"Tony Hendra's account of his life with Father Joe and the wisdom he imparts is something that every person can relate to. Although Father Joe is a monk, he never loses touch with his humanity or the real world. In many ways, Father Joe is much more in touch with his humanity and the human condition than we are. ""The only real sin is s-s-selfishness"" he often says in the book. His gentle pointed commentary on Tony's life is something we should all take to heart."
3,Why the left wing rants?,"I might commit a mortal sin if I could acquire the command of the English language that Hendra has, but I don't get his use of silly and distracting comments about conservative politicians and instutions. Funny, I'm also a product of a Benedictine education, but I didn't walk away thinking Ronald Regan's face looked like a ""scrotum."" Get serious, Tony, pull out your Rosary Beads and try to cut loose some of that anger!"
1,Penultimate Example of Playing One's Self,"I read this recently, in a public library so as not to help Hendra's sales. I read it after being exposed to his daughter Jessica's book which makes a convincing case that he molested her.The narcissism was always self-evident in this book. But for Hendra to draw this picture the way he did where Father Joe's last advice to him is that he was put on this Earth to be a good parent and husband, that that was his destiny ... amazing. Hendra's fictitious bologna will stand throughout the ages as the penultimate example of ""playing thyself"" in print.To the extent that Father Joe actually told him anything like that, it reflects both Father Joe's disconnect with reality, borne of his insular life within ""the Church"", and the natural acceptance of pedophiliac tendancies that such a life seems to correlate to.""A Life Wasted Badly"" would be a better title."
5,Father Joe,"The book was in excellent condition but I had specified that it be shipped to another person and it was shipped to me. So, specify and underline it."
2,Only Jesus can save souls,"I remember reading Son of God comics in college. I thought if there is a God, then this guy is going to have a lot to answer for. Here is a guy with a spiritual bent who has great talents and luck and throws it all back in the face of his Creator. His story and subsequent Church attendence is like throwing a bone to God, just in case it may be true, as time starts to run out for his selfish life. If his conversion were true you would expect to find more humility than the jabs he throws at his fellow pilgrims. I think he has to be a lot more broken before he can find peace with God."
2,Yoda: The Jedi Who Saved My Soul by Darth Vader,"Having just finished listening to the audio version of this book as the new Star Wars movie opens, it seemed to beg for a satiric version with this title. For the work of a card-carrying satirist, this book takes itself very seriously. By turns it aims at uplift and revenge, high drama and low blows. It features more heavy-handed foreshadowing than most soap operas and seems to have been edited with a chainsaw. Not surprising for a writer who has busied himself in Hollywood this tome is an over-hyped under-achiever."
5,Unexpected pleasure,I dearly loved this book even though it had a lot of words in it that I had to look up. It took me to a place I had never experienced and introduced me to a man I would love to have known. Thanks to Tony Hendra for enriching my life!
1,This book has a sad backstory the author never addresses!,"With all the glowing reviews for Tony Hendra's book, many people will be shocked, as I was, to hear that the author has been hit with strong allegations of incest and child abuse.A New York Times article headlined ""Daughter Says Father's Confessional Book Didn't Confess His Molestation Of Her,"" reports that Hendra's daughter, Jessica Hendra, now 39, has come forward to demand her father finally admit to repeatedly molesting her as a child dating back to when she was 12-years-old.This book needs a sequel. Or a prequel. At least, a mea culpa! And Random House owes its readers an apology."
1,Very Disappointed,"This is a sad book about a very selfish person that wasted his life while inflicting much pain on others. I would have found the read more palatable if Hendra actually experienced a metanoia, but it remains clear he continues to view himself as the center of the universe. The lessons and love unconditionally offered by Fr. Joseph were ignored at best and at worst persecuted.A couple of other points: (a) I find it impossible to believe the ""recollections"" are accurate as this author is prone to extreme fabrication, and (b) I found the ""name dropping"" to be tedious and off the mark. Silly me, I thought the book might actually be about the title - ""The Man Who Saved My Soul"". This one goes in the trash bin. I wish I could get my money back."
2,"""Very superficial...""","If you come to read this book simply for a fairly engrossing story, you may enjoy the read. If, on the other hand, like me, you read this book in hopes of hearing an honest account of one man's soul-searching (as the title implies), you will come away disappointed and slightly disgusted. I kept waiting for the heavy and inspirational moment of truth, and was completely let-down. What's the point? I didn't find any soul saved."
1,Don't spend money on this book.....,"What a disappointment! Tony Hendra left me with a feeling that he was and probably still is, pretty shallow.Did he ever attempt to ""clean up the messes he left behind""?This is definitely not the kind of guy you'd want your daughter to end up with."
5,Moving Beyond Belief,"I was so moved and touched by this exceptional telling of one man's journey of faith and faithlessness. Tony Hendra's telling of how Father Joe helped shape him and what Father Joe said and lived, made me look at my own faith in a new light. This book made me smile and cry and wish that the end would never come. I think we all need a Father Joe."
1,Disgusting,"A pack of nauseating junk from a narcissistic, self-serving child molester. I read this book first, and then ""How to Cook Your Daughter,"" by Jessica Hendra. I found ""Father Joe"" to be unbelievable and self-indulgent from the outset. After reading the absolutely believable words of his daughter, wife, and ex-friends...this book is unworthy of being read, let alone praised."
2,Expected So Much and Got So Little,"Over the years I've purchased several books which were recommended by Don Imus. All of his previous selections have been outstanding. I'm not sure if he really read this book cover to cover. There are funnier books you can read and there are more religious books you can read. I just did not ""get it"" from this book. Father Joe by all accounts was a wonderful man, maybe a book solely on his life would have been more worth while. If there wasn't all the hype surrounding this book maybe I would not have been disappointed. I expected so much and got so little."
2,What did I miss?,"A major disappointment... I must have missed something. The book was no more than OK. I expected to be inspired, instead I was bored and tired."
2,Terrible,"This book was terrible ... he isn't funny enough to compensate for his ego. At the end when he realizes he wasn't the center of Father Joe's life he is surprised ... that just about sums it up. Imagine, this wonderful man had other people in his life ... how could he be surprised?"
3,A good read.,"I must say I enoyed the book, however it was mostly about Mt. Hendra, and little about Fr. Joe. I also found it difficult to read for some reason (probably my inability with big words), and was forced to read the book slowly to comprehend exactly what it was that Mr. Henrda way trying to get across. I agree with those who see it somewhat as an ego trip....or maybe anapologetic. However I must admit I did enjoy it. I'm not sure if I would suggest it to someone else."
2,Sorry Imus...Your first miss!,"Learned of this from the Imus show, anxiously awaited its arrival, left it at JFK on purpose. While I loved the story, the entire book was ruined due to Mr. Hendra's in-your-face socialistic bent and hateful remarks on the US and President Reagan. I happened to be reading the book during Mr. Reagan's funeral week, but that wasn't behind my distaste. I don't mind reading books that oppose my viewpoint, but I refuse to endore a book that throws in political opinions that do not belong in the book and add NOTHING to the story. Why does the author take every opportunity, in a ""spiritual"" book, to spew his venom on the US and Ronald Reagan. You can almost see the publisher asking him to throw this garbage in during the nelection year for a few liberal pundits to pounce on."
2,Father Joe--a disappointment,"This book is more about Tony Hendra than Father Joe. The few times Father Joe appears in the book might be said to be ""inspirational"" in how he interprets or views certain situations. However Tony's ""soul"" is not ""saved"" until his middle age years--the time when many of us reflect on how we have progressed in life. A major disappointment..."
5,A quiet moment for the soul,"Simply put, I loved this book. Every inch the cynic Tony Hendra is or has been, at a very basic level I crave the medicine Father Joe has to offer & delighted in the dose, however second hand (would that Quarr were around the corner!). There's a lot here to ponder, particularly in the final chapters when Hendra launches into a what-if-nothing jesuitical argument for & against faith. A joy to read & consider."
4,Father Joe,"""Father Joe"" is a good book to take along on a relaxing vacation when there's time to ponder...life.Well-written, it holds interest from beginning to end. Although not a biography, the paragraphs about Quarr Abbey and the saintly monk leave me longing to be there...to experience his presence and receive his counsel. There are, among the pages, some powerful life lessons that make me yearn for more opportunity to glean from Fr. Joe's wisdom, and for the privilege to have known him."
3,If I could give 3.5 I would,Father Joe sounds like a fascinating guy the only problem is that most of the later parts of the book are not about Father Joe caring and insightful monk but rather about Tony Hendra. While it was interesting to see the author struggle with his faith and eventually turn away from it there is an inability on my part to feel any kind of sympathy for the man he eventually became.I'll go easy on him as a child I mean we all did strange things because we were lonely or misunderstood but having to read pages and pages of the self destructive behavior perpetrated by the author was almost too much to take. The only thing that kept me interested was waiting to see how the life of old Father Joe turned out.Overall-Parts of the book were fascinating but the book needed less Tony Hendra and more Father Joe.
3,"Succeeds, despite itself","This book is not exactly what it appears to be. It is more an autobiography of the author than anything else. It also feels about twice as long as it actually is as the author rambles on, and on. Being a Catholic myself, I found much of the religious detail very interesting. But by the halfway point I was ready to put it down and walk away and only stuck with it based on a friend's recommendation. It total, it was a good, if often tedious read. However, I am very glad I borrowed this book instead of buying it."
2,very disappointing,"Father Joe's luminous spirituality and sound sense shine through, but far too much of the book deals with with Hendra's not especially interesting life. The author's life is only interesting to readers when he brings his issues to Father Joe.The rave reviews this book received attests to the hunger for genuine spirituality in an age of charlatans posing as men of God peddling the gospel of mammon on TV and with a dangerous evangelical in the White House."
2,STAY AWAY FROM TOSHIBA ! BULB /LAMP DIED IN A LESS THAN 2 MONTHS AND NO REPLACEMENT AT THIS TIME ??,"I BOUGHT THIS TOSHIBA from AMAZON/ONECALL.COM ON DEC 8 2005 AND WITHIN 2 MONTHS, WITH AN AVERAGE OF 2 HOURS OF WATCHING, ITS PICTURE BULB DIED ( IN LESS THAN 100 HOURS OF USE ).CALLED TOSHIBA AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE LAMP. IT IS ON BACKORDER AND THEY TOLD THAT IT MAY TAKE 3 WEEKS OR MORE.SO IT MEANS I AM GOING TO MISS THE SUPERBOWL SEASON AND THIS HUGE 72"" DEAD TOSHIBA IS SITTING DEAD IN LIVING ROOM.I HEARD LOT OF TOSHIBA DLP TV'S HAVE UNRELIABLE LAMPS AND IT CAN TAKE A MONTHS TO GET IT REPLACED ????..I WOULD RECOMMEND TO KEEP AWAY FROM TOSHIBA AND GO WITH SAMSUNG OR SONY.IF YOU DECIDE TO BUY IT ANYWAY, MAKE SURE YOU GET 3 YEARS OF WARRANTY WITH IT , WITH FREE BULB REPLACEMENT, AS ONE TIME BULB REPLACEMENT CAN COST YOU OVER $300..."
1,Poor Customer Service,"After purchasing this TV from amazon.com for $4,000. I had it delivered within 1 week. However, when the TV arrived the company that delivered it did not hook it up, they just brought it in the house. When I tried plugging it in, it wouldn't work. I called Amazon.com and they said they are not responsible for repair as this was supposed to be checked out by the freight company who delivered it. After 5 calls to Amazon.com they told me to find a local reapir shop to fix it which I did. After 4 weeks from two different reapir shops I did get the TV working. It has a nice picture but I really don't like the way Amazon.com handled the problem. Especially when the price was four thousand dollars."
2,Check Samsung or Sony for More Reliable TV !,Based on TV recently bought by my friendMy Friend told me that he would never buy 'Toshiba' again because of Lamp Issues and Reliability and Picture Quality for Money.I thought of this one but changed my mind and bought 'Sony' and have no problems since last 5 months. Happy With Sony ...
1,defective belly button ring,"This belly button ring was crooked,the butterfly was uneven. It is still wearable, but bothers me that it is not symmetric in shape. It was too inexpensive to ship back, so I guess you get what you pay for !"
3,the walking dead,Didn't care for the book. Seems to be alot of fiction would not recommend it to anyone that was there.
1,The Walking Dead,"Mr. Roberts attempts to capture the essence of the Vietnam combat experience for the noncombatant reader, which can't be done. One has to live it to really understand it. Simply ask any Vietnam Vet and they will tell you...Only those who've ""been there"" can understand. I find it extrememly difficult to believe that Mr. Roberts lead a recon team, served as a sniper, advised a CAC team of ARVN Rangers, and was shot down and rescued... all in one tour, and as only a PFC. I would rate the book as a work based on limited historical fact, mixed with large doses of personal fictional embellishments designed to entice the reader to purchase more of the author's works. By the way, it was 1/9 who were ""The Walking Dead"".Robert J. SylerMaster Chief Petty Officer, USNR RETIREDAlpha Company, 1st Battalion, 9th MarinesCombat Corpsman 1966-'67"
5,A Good Read.,"My criteria for any book is simple. The writing must be excellent. The story must be plausible. And the subject has to be absorbing. This book satisfies my requirements and gets 5 stars.I was in the military and served in Vietnam. The information in this book is consistent with my experiences and the experiences depicted in similar books about Vietnam. I cant argue if Roberts wuz or wuznt in the Walking Dead Battalion. I dont know. I do know that me and my friends from Vietnam argue about events we experienced together. I served several weeks with one outfit in Vietnam, but was never formally assigned to that unit. Consequently, I dont get invited to their reunions. I spent exactly two weeks in still another outfit, was formally assigned to it, and can tell you almost nothing about it. Some of my friends had similar experiences. They were volunteered for temporary duty elsewhere, and there is no formal record of it. So the issue of ""assignment"" is irrelevant to me."
1,THE WALKING DEAD,"There is more embellishment in this tall tale of a book. Like was said in one of the other reviews....to do all that was said and done in one tour as a Pfc is more fictional than truth. Don't waste your time and more important don't waste the 97 cents for a used one. I personally was in Vietnam in 1965-66 starting with Fox Company 2/9 for a little over two months and was transferred to Bravo 1/9 as a Pfc.Again, there are Marines that served in 2/9 and 3/9 lay claim to the (WALKING DEAD). A few years ago in a buisness in Phoenix there in the office was a Walking Dead sticker. I asked the owner who he was with and he said 2/9. So you will always have the wanabees and I informed him that 2/9 has no connection with the Walking Dead. Nuff said. Get a life and if you write another book maybe it should be fiction??Liam JonesUSMCACTA NON VERBA"
2,Sister of a Marine MIA with 1/9...The Walking Dead,"These authors should be ashamed of themselves for misleading their readers. Taking the name of The Walking Dead away from 1/9 in their book is shameful. My brother, SSGT Gregory R. Benton, Jr., is one of two Marines Missing in Action with 1/9. The Walking Dead earned that title and no other Vietnam veteran who did not serve with that Battalion has the right to say they did...even in fiction. Any true 1/9r who reads this book will know the truth. I am going to contact these authors and let them know how I feel."
1,Too much hype,"All this talk of the naming of the Walking Dead. Wonder if anyone can document their claims on the naming of the battalion.From the excerpts it sounds more like fiction than truth. 1/9 was on Operation Starlight, but only played a small part. Hill 55 and the area around it are where the combat was during that period.The action in the south(Danang) does not compare with the fights on the DMZ and the Ashau Valley. Not to say that one could not get killed in the south, but it was a different war.I tend to agree with David Anderson's assessment of the book."
5,"Track to Track, Best Aswad CD Ever","I bought this CD on the strength of the video for ""Follow '99"" but every track on this CD is excellent. The great thing about reggae is how old school artists like Aswad and Third World can reinvent themselves after 20 years in the business and still sound fresh."
3,An average story,"""Binky Rules"" is just not one of the best. It has a plot that isn't fiting in the story. So if you want my opinion, I wouldn't read this one."
2,"Nice, but missing a crucial song!","Simon Boswell did not do as nice of a job as he usually does with selecting just the perfect selection, unfortunately Boswell made a fatal error by not including the inchanting song that was composed for the movie's trailer. If it were included, the soundtrack would be certain to top the charts."
3,"Pretty good, but missing THE song!","I was mostly impressed by the soundtrack, but very disappointed that it doesn't have the song from the movie trailer. If anyone knows the person who DOES sing that song, and the name of the song, please email me with it!!"
3,THE song everyone loves is Yanni!,"I think the song everyone mentions from the trailer is found on Yanni's ""Live from the Acropolis"" believe or not. I usually don't like Yanni but I do like his mix on that song. Unfortunatley I don't remember the name of the song."
3,Displeased with adhesive,"The Billy Bob teeth themselves are great looking. However, the adhesive supplied with the teeth is worthless. Dentists have told me that NOTHING will stick to porcelain; so if you have dentures or caps, bridges, etc. this product will not work for you. I used the adhesive and molded to my teeth (but would not stick); after drying I used Fixodent to adhere to the Bubby's and mine. Worked for a comedy number but not much longer."
1,gipped,I went thru the process of downloading the game and got nothing. It's a crap shoot with the dice against you. You order and nothing happens except you are out the money.
4,mildly interesting,"Not a masterpiece, but I was able to keep reading it without feeling totally bored to death.I thought the depiction of Orthodoxy was somewhat one-sided but not completely negative; I know a few baal teshuvot (though admittedly no one from the kind of environment described in the book) and I can't imagine anyone refusing to be called by their English name or similar foolishness. (But then again, Andrea and her fiance were so messed up before they became Orthodox that they might be atypical). But the ""us against the secular world"" attitude that Andrea expresses does ring true to some extent.The book also struck me as part of a common trend of our time- the failure of ultraliberalism seems to have bred a resurgent ultraconservatism, whether in religion or politics."
5,Another outstanding work from Ann Roiphe,"Ann Roiphe has a take on REAL life that gives her the opportunity to write compellingly on issues which are addressed by many of us. This dilemma is handled carefully, and sensitively. For me, it made non stop reading."
2,Lots of puzzles but poor editing,"I am hooked on Sudoku and it takes my spare time even if only a couple of minutes. Which is why I rely on the categories, I usually expect Easy to only take me a couple of minutes; even with medium I don't need to take notes. Unfortunately that is not the case with this set of puzzles. In fact, the very first one in the Easy category wasn't that 'easy'. But then some of the hard ones are actually easy.There are a lot to do and it will be fun. If not for the poor editing I would have rated it 5 stars."
4,"So many puzzles, so little time!","Though I tend to agree with other reviewers about the editing (as in, some puzzles seem out of place as to difficulty), overall, this book offers a lot of puzzles for little money. I also like the fact that the paper doesn't fall apart with one erasure, as happens with many sudoku magazines and books that are printed on pulp paper. If you like to do sudoku at pretty much any level, this book has got lots of rainy days tucked away for you."
4,Hard to find at a reasonable price,3 great songs from this show - not one of the best musicals written- but a good one.
3,"Portuguese Renaissance - contemplative, not much variety","Frei Manuel Cardoso and Duarte Lobo are the two most important composers of Portugal in the age of the Renaissance. They are exact contemporaries, Cardoso 1566-1650 and Lobo 1565-1646. Not that I hear any significant stylistic difference. All the works sung by The Sixteen are a capella. The music is mostly ecstatic, meditative, contemplative, in the manner of Palestrina. The first eight tracks are Cardoso, the rest Lobo. The disc's 63 minutes is pleasant but doesn't offer much variety, much beef either (no resounding Gloria here), nor as much harmonic surprises as in the music of the English Renaissance.Informative liner notes. The disc was originally recorded in 1994 by the now demised Collins Classics (Manuel Cardoso / Duarte Lbo, which is how I have it), and this is the reissue on The Sixteen's own label."
5,Soothing for Sleep,"I thought that this CD was an incredible thing to relax by. I've always had trouble falling asleep, but this CD really helped. It is very soothing, and I can imagine myself in a nice forest by a stream on a mountain. I highly reccomend it!"
1,speaker static,"I'm sorry but this product sounds exactly like speaker static. I can not tell if it is water or just static. There's no ""bubbling"" or anything! Find something else. At least there's no music added."
4,Glorious Pressed flower project.,"I really havn't used this book yet, but it looks vbery interesting and with many helpful ideas and instructions, Looks gooid!"
2,The worst set of cookware I have ever owned !,"Like the reviews I have been reading online, I too have had terrible problems with the cookware from tabletops unlimited ( Philippe Richard ). I got my as a Christmas gift from my parents and when I opened the box one of the saucepans was bent up and will not hold the lid on tight. I only use plastic utensils and non-abrasive sponges on it yet the non-stick is coming off two of the pans and some of the pans are getting rusty on the bottoms of them. You have to cook on a low heat or you burn your food. The only plus on this cookware is the food slides out good if it does not get burnt on it. I would NOT RECOMMEND this product to anyone. I am 49 years old and have never had such a terrible set of cookware. I think it is better to stay with name brand things from now on."
1,dont waste the money,"these pans are terrible! easily the worst ive ever owned, within 6 mo pans were thoroughly rusted through. only plus is that they are easy to clean but that doesnt help now that they are too rusted to use."
3,gift for daughter,"The pots seemed a little cheap in the picture, but my daughter said that all her pots were bad - so I was looking for quanity rather than quality.She has since told me that she's very happy with the set and that she is puzzled that I thought they weren't as good as they should be."
5,very useful for beginners,"This is a well put together bundle of cookware, very useful for beginners in cooking and even a new family. The vessels are sturdy and easily cleanable. The bundled bonus items are perfect and I LOVE THE SET"
4,Bought cookware- Price dropped 20.00,I just bought this cookware for a Christmas gift for 59.00- Within a few days the price dropped from 59.95 to 39.99- $20.00- I just emailed Amazon hoping to get some credit. Gee it was only a matter of a few days.
3,Company is worse to deal with!,Hi!I found a website for Tabletops Unlimited Inc (www.tabletopsunltd.com) and call the company to see what I could do for a sauce pan that had a cracked handle (had less than 3 months!!!) and they informed me that I needed to pay the shipping and handeling to send it back so they could in return mail me a new saucepan!!! WHAT A JOKE!!!! That makes this set not worth it!
2,Too little information,"This is a big book with too little information. The gane is very confusing. I bought the book to help me learn and understand the game. No help. For example, I wanted to know how the scoring system worked when you are given a ranking. It has one paragraph, and just says it is complcated. Thanks, that helps. The book is thick because it fills up the pages with filler. Example, a full page for each character. Where is the information behind the scenes? This is a very heavy stat based game, but it does not go into the numbers at all. The only good part is in covering the missions, but that could have been done better too. Way below average - very rushed. They obviously did not have access to the developers, as there is nothing that I could not have written after playing the game after 2 weeks."
5,Metal Gear Acid2 Strategy Guide,Highly informative. Recommended for any one that is a fan of Metal Gear or any one that is having trouble finishing the game.
2,Should've listened to samples first,"I wanted a CD of rousing marches, but this doesn't sound like it could get anyone out of their seat."
2,"If you love patriotic music, this is your cd","As far as a patriotic cd goes, this is one that you will probably want to kill for. Just kidding! This is a great selection of patriotic music. The orchestra gives a great performance of these masterful songs. I personally rather listen to beautiful romantic love songs than patriotic songs, but this music is an important part of American history and i think we need it.I WOULD LUKE WARMLY RECOMMEND THIS CD"
4,This is really incredible,"Give me a break, how can a band be so good? I discovered the Waco Brothers via the Mekons/Jon Langford. I got 'Cowboy in Flames' and I was instantly hooked. I just got this CD about a week ago, so it hasn't fully sunk in yet, but I can tell you, it's a good'un for sure. Basically, the music consists of simple chord structures, highly effective pop hooks, clever lyrics, and country-rock instrumentation. You won't completely appreciate it until you actually hear it. ""Country-rock"" just doesn't do it justice. I don't know if a band could be more evenly and perfectly split between the two genres. For those already familiar with the band, you know what to do. If you like perfect, unpretentious rock with a bit of twang, get it now."
3,Vocabulary,"This book basicly teaches you a new vocabulary. It explains a large number of theories on earthquake predition and why none work. It goes into tuned circuits which is electrical engineering 101 but it uses a lot of new and different terms from what electrical engineers use. If you want to enlarge your vocabulary then it is a good book, other wise not so much."
5,Earthshaking science by Susan Hough,"The book is very well organized, clear, easy to read.It gives the lastest development in the earthquake seismology without getting involved in imperical equations. I recomend this book for everybody intersted in earth science.Mamdouh R. GadallahHouston Texas"
5,Ceres Rocks!!!,"I would consider this to be one of the best animes ever. It is like Sailor Moon, except with a better plot, more action, romance, and gore. It is the best ever!"
3,Ok I guess,If you are going to watch it read the manga first it is soooooo much better than the anime but nonetheless it was a good movie but aya's voice is really annoying!
3,Old Cash Cow,It is pitiful that a product this old is still being milked for money. These people should spend a few hours and do some work on the product and update it instead of still trying to bleed something dry that should have gone to public domain years ago.There is a lot that could easily be done to turn this into a viable product now with only a few hours of programming time.The bugs and play balance could certainly be fixed rather quickly.
3,Too great of a generalization.,"I bought this book because I really enjoyed ""Eat right 4 your type"". But I was somewhat dissapointed in this. It was an over simplification of a very complicated issue. The 4 basic personality types didn't hold true for most people I know, and I think its a little difficult to put all humans in the world into only 4 catagories anyway. It just doesn't hold up. I understand the authors generalizations, but just don't agree that people's personalities are so easily typed into such few catagories. Homeopathy uses over 100 catagories and that is incomplete. Some of the point made are interesting, but in general its not what I'd hoped for."
1,A total waste of time...,"The worst book I have seen in a while! Pretty wrong about me personally. Regardless of the book's personal failing for me, it is awfully written. It says things like, 'you like to be alone and are also very social.' This is about how deep the book gets."
1,Bad,I've tried several diets including this one. I gained weight on all of them. The only time I lost weight is when I ate a high protien diet which is opposite for the recomendation for my blood type. The time when I gained the most is when I ate for my blood type.
1,total pre-teen-level puff piece,"Here is a theory which claims to have scientific backing but doesn't give any, because there isn't any. The author claims that unnamed ""scientists"" have produced ""extensive evidence"" of the ""genetic link"" between personality and blood groups. This would be news to the scientific community worldwide, which has found no such link. He even gets his basic facts wrong, for instance saying that ""if your parents are A's, so are you."" (The truth is that offspring of A parents can be A or O.)Most of the book reads like a teenybopper astrology column, telling O's they are easygoing and funloving, A's they are athletic, AB's they are creative, etc. Something for everybody, all of it imaginary! You might as well save your money and read your horoscope, or tea leaves, or patterns on your wall. This book will be useful only to science teachers and other thinking people, as an example of how much fluff is out there to entertain the gullible public."
1,It's great looking. That's it.,"This watch is horrid, as another reviewer mentioned he started having problems with the light. As did I. After a few months of usage the watch light would cause the entire watch face to go blank. It did this for about 6 weeks then it just died.. entirely. I took it to a watch maker and he told me there was nothing to be done."
2,Great until it hit water,"A few months after purchasing this watch I had to change the battery. No real biggie, figured it was sitting for a while before I bought it. Well this past weekend I finally decide to wear it in the pool. This waterproof watch does not handle water. We are talking just going underwater. It is kaput. No function at all now. Says right on the face that it is good to 100m. I was standing in the pool with my hands underwater. Very disappointed."
1,One lap in the pool = dead,"Aside from having that super annoying and unnecessary accidental button that changes the time by one hour, I went for a swim with it on, excited to have a water resistant watch to check lap times with. The instructions specify to not press buttons while under water so I started the lap timer while still dry and dove in. ONE LAP LATER, this piece of sh** was dead and filled with water. It is getting sent back immediately."
3,Rippington formula for cookie-cutter jazz,"Didn't the Rippingtons already release a CD with this title?! I predict the next one will have a cat sitting in the Australian Outback looking like Crocodile Dundee on the CD cover. Observation: Jeff Kashiwa would always get replaced by session saxophonists on the CD...so what happened to his replacement Paul Taylor?!!! Welcome Eric Marienthal and Dave Koz on this CD, hope Taylor didn't give up his solo career for this gig. Oh, my review....if you heard a Rippington CD like say FIVE cd's ago, the one with the snow skiing cat?! This one sounds just like it....."
2,R.I.P. ingtons,"I Don't know what happened to The Rippingtons; They used to be so good. Now all they care about is the money. They are not taking their time to write their material. Either get tracks 1,2,3,7 or 11 from this album or get all their other albums before this one."
2,It's over,"I love the Rippingtons and it pains me to say this, but their run is over. When the members started leaving, so did the sound and style. Frontman, Russ Freeman will always be the man, but it's just not the same..buy it if you want to, but it's not the Ripps we knew and loved..et"
1,terrible!,"When you listen to albums like Curves Ahead and Welcome To The St James Club you wonder if this is really the same band. It isn't, of course, and thats why its so awful. The high-octane tracks of old have been replaced by warbling, elevator-music fodder. I almost fell asleep listening to it. Russ Freeman has written some great stuff in the past but this is much too predictable. It drags up every cliche and recycles it. Elements of Marc Antoine, Santana etc are all mixed in an unholy brew. Its tragic because we know Freeman is capable of his own dynamic sound whereas this sounds flat and lifeless. This isn't the Rippingtons, its a commercially-orientated mess."
3,Good,It was a purchase to replace a previous purchase and yet it was difficult to copy to my ipod. That feature had nothing to do with the seller it is a glitch the company selling the cd's has put into the cd. It has hapened on nearly all of my Rippington cd's although they were put to my ipod!
2,Yawn....,"I have reviewed this CD and I'm not to happy with it. I'm considered a die hard Rippingtons fan and I found this CD to be quite a yawner. I don't know what happens to artists after a while but I think they loose that musical touch when they get older sometimes. Russ Freeman can do better. His earlier CD's like ""Curves Ahead"" were extremely power, but ever since he lost Mark Portman the music has faded. Who's hacking music? Maybe the catchy publishing title has back-fired."
3,"""Too short"" say 2nd Graders @ The Potomac School, McLean, VA","Second graders enjoyed most the funny names of the ""funny"" friends in this tale of a new girl in a new town. Although they laughed at her inventive excuses, this audience wanted more from the main character--more interaction with her playmates and more dialogue directed at the reader. These seven and eight year olds would have preferred a longer story, perhaps even a chapter book with much more mischief from Guy-Guy, Bickerina and Mr. Dobie. Student reviewers recommend this title for reading aloud to kindergarten through third grade listeners."
1,What is this?,"I ordered this based on an online review and was very dissappointed. I have heard whale's singing on other albums and on television, and they were always much more beautiful than this. Also, the other online reviewer touted the background music. I didn't hear any background music, only the background sound of waves and gurgling water. If there was background music, maybe it was meant for the whales and was outside the range of human hearing, or maybe I missed it because I couldn't sit through the entire track. Oh well, it was cheap, I guess I shouldn't complain too much."
4,"Great Advice, Good tool for novice and advanced goaltenders","Vic LeMire provides some excellent technical advice for those who play the position and I recommend the book.The picture quality is not that great and in some instances, distracts from the concepts explained. For an advanced goalie, its no big deal because it is easy to visualize Mr. Lemire's style tips and pointers, but for somebody new to the position, it could be a bit confusing.That said, it is a superb manual for anybody seeking self-development as a hockey goaltender."
1,"It bend with a 5 MPH wind, I do not recomended","Light weight material, with normal ligth wind it bent, I try two different ones, and with the two the same problem"
4,Great buy for the $$,With a lightweight Flag this pole works fine. It is a little weak in the top section but I used it for a weekend camp with no problems.
5,Had a stuck G peg,Peg was stuck! Luth told me id need a (EXPENSIVE) custom fit peg to fix it. I was so upset I was looking into internally geared pegs when people keept telling me about peg dope. Man this stuff works!No real instructions though... You just kinda rub a crapload of it on the peg (removed from instrument) on the two spots it sits in the peg boxAfter afew slow twists the peg will become so loose you cant even tune but it will work offjust becarful you dont put enough on cause i almost got it stuck again! Thats why im suggesting you put a crapload on
3,READ BEFORE BUYING!,This is WAY smaller than expected. The price is excellent the quality is excellent but is just not what is expected in size and quantity. I would recommend this product to any student or professional!
4,The Development of a Career,"I sometimes wonder why young writers allow their publishers to talk them into releasing a ""selected poems"" volume. Almost invariably, they will come to see much of their earliest work as a development, not a finished product. That fact is very much in evidence in this work. Maxwell makes selections from his first 3 books, and each book is more accomplished than the one before. His formalism becomes more assured with each successive book. As such, I recommend this book to people interested in Maxwell from his other works, or who are interested in neo-formal poetry in general. Be aware, though, that you can't judge the whole book by the first few poems."
4,good value,great if you like cooking on cast iron. was present for wife and she loved it. only problem is storage.
4,either or,"This book is either totally heresy or everything we should have learned about God, had we been really paying attention to Jesus. I think think the latter. A gentle and very kind way of taking seriously what Jesus was really saying about God and applying it to daily life."
4,"IF Grace Is True, Why God Will Save Everybody",I found it to be very controversial--- with many things with which I agree and I some things with which I had difficulty or do not agree. I read this book because my adult Sunday Schol class was studying it. Needless to say there were many lively discussions. The main thing I got out of it was that it caused me (and the class) to think about what do we believe. I don't think you have to believe everything the authors put fort but it is food for thought and a worthwhile read.
1,Pooe interpretation,"Being an Universalist myself (after many years of study) I was rather shocked to read that Mr. Gulley doesn't believe everything in the Bible. (see pages 53,54). He relies more on his experiences.On page 130 he states that ""God made the flood that killed all but 8 persons- this isn't the God who made clothes for Adam & Eve"". Does he want us to believe in two gods??In his remarks about the Love of God he refers to Jer. 31:31-34, John 12:32, Phil.2:9-11 which do represent God as ""saving"" everyone"" and then goes on to say God in not judgmental. Well, if God is not judgmental then why did He instruct Joshua to kill all the inhaditants of Jericho? Ai?I returned the book as it was too weak in many basic doctrinal areas.Read at your own risk.............."
1,"Yes, God loves ALL","Yes, God does love all. That is why He provided His Son, and the gift of Grace given to us through that Son.I'm sorry that the authors diminish what our Savior did on the cross for them. I'm sorry that the authors don't know the same majestic and almighty God that I do: one of love and grace, of truth and wisdom, of holiness and righteousness, one who provided the ONLY way for sinful man to be with Him, which is through a gift of LOVE, the gift of salvation through Christ.What a well written, but feeble attempt to argue against the Way.Barb"
1,Unconvincing in Every Way,Unintellectual. The entire book is one big red herring. Their exegesis is inconsistent.
3,Not the Best Exposition,"I read this book after reading Talbott's ""The Inescapable Love of God"". What a difference! ""If Grace is True"" qualifies, in my view, as inspirational reading, i.e., if you already believe in universalism, much of it will have you saying ""Amen"", and it will inspire you to act accordingly. As serious theology, or Scriptural analysis, it is weak.For those who want a systematic exposition and discussion of the Scriptural, Historical and Theological bases for Universalism, Talbott's book is far better. Don't judge Universalism by ""If Grace is True"". The arguments are far stronger than this book might lead you to conclude."
4,If Grace is True: ...,"I strongly recommend this excellent book! It reads like the way I feel God's love, rather than a chapter and verse forumla. You don't have to agree with every position taken - although I did (for the first 124 pages).The authors make a reasonable case for viewing just a bit past specific scripture. I sincerely hope they turn out to be right and that God's plan is for universal reconciliation. The examples offered seem compelling to me.One of the better lines in the book - ""Do you really think God will damn you to hell for overestimating His love?"""
3,"Book: If Grace Is True, Why God Will Save Every Person","Well thought out and written book about a controversial topic---the ultimate salvation of every person, regardless of belief in Jesus Christ. I don't agree with everything the authors said, but I understand how they've gotten to where they are. I can't accept what they believe about Jesus Christ because they too easily dismiss a serious look at scripture, so their view is purely a subjective experience."
2,"Long on Speculation, Short on Scripture","This book is well-written and engaging, a remarkable thing if you consider that it was written by two men. They speak seamlessly with one voice, though, and do not distinguish which is writing at any particular time.The arguments against the traditional Christian view of heaven and hell and in favor of universalism are rooted not in Scripture, but rather experience. Many passages are quoted, but generally out of context. The writers explain that it really doesn't matter to them what the Bible says on these or other issues anyway, as experience is their ultimate authority.This subjective placing of experience as the ultimate religious authority is what really caused their faith in the Trinity, Incarnation and sacrificial Atonement to unravel, and not Universalism.For a better study of the subject from a biblical perspective, see ""The Inescapable Love of God"" by Thomas Talbott."
2,NOT universal reconcilliation.,"I am a firm believer in Universal Reconcilliation (Christian Universalism or whatever term is being used for it). This book is just the opposite of Christian Universalism, and if you are really interested in that mode of thinking there are many great books out there like The Inescapable Love of God by Thomas Talbott-- it is thorough, biblical, and convincing.This book on the other hand says that Jesus basically was not divine, that Bible is just to be ignored, that homosxuality is not a sin, etc.I am a universalist. I believe that all will be saved. But this book is not about how that takes place. There is a big resurgence of Christian universalism right now, and this book does NOT represent it."
4,"Good thesis, weak support","I'm a universalist myself, but I don't feel this book makes the best case for universalism. If you're comfortable with the idea of ""weighing scripture"" and a few emotional appeals you won't have any problems with this book, but if you're looking for biblical support of univeralism you won't find it hear. I recommend Talbott's The Inescapable Love Of God as a companion to this book. They complement each other well in their approaches. Talbott's book attempts to prove universalism using logic and scripture."
5,The freedom in grace,Leads to understanding that one can fall from grace. It is grace that has set a believer free and one must accept it.
2,disappointing,"As a Universalist myself, I was intitially delighted to encounter a widely distributed book that defended universal salvation. However, the problem with this book is that most Christians will likely dismiss it because of the authors' liberal theology. Gulley and Mulholland go beyond what is essential to universalism and espouse beliefs that are unacceptable to the majority of Christians. If they could have just stuck to the basics of Universalism, this book would be much more valuable. You don't have to be as liberal as Gulley and Mulholland to be a Universalist. I respect the authors' opinions, but I think this book will not be accepted by most of the Christian community.A better book on the subject is Thomas Talbott's ""The Inescapable Love of God."" Talbott sticks to the subject much better, and evangelical Christians could read his book without being too offended."
1,Painful!!,"Operatica is a great example of how to mess things up when one simply plasters ""beats"" - mindless, pedestrian electronica under a different genre. In this case opera. The entire listening expereince is anti-cathartic, to say the least - reminiscent of the auto rickshaws plying the Bombay streets pumping out C-grade hi-treble bollywood `remixes'. Painful!! On the other hand, few years back on a similar foundation - electronica based classical projectRhythmic Fission: Digital Revisions of Classic Trax. That had some cutting edge DJs and producers of the progressive electronica camp, so they not only had a thorough understanding (and respect for the music), they catered to subtle nuances that allowed for Bartok, Bach or Stravinsky to be breathed a new life into without them turning in their graves.....maybe that's why it was aptly titled ""fission""....as opposed to hapless `fusion'."
3,Ok music,"I like this CD. Its one of the better Art of Noise rip-offs. The composer just put some ambient rhythm and bass lines around Mareen's vocals that really didn't mesh as so much as provide background noise. No original arrangement, just the same tired quick-beats and DNA bass groove repeated endlessly.I loved her vocals. The compose wisely chose to not over-process it and stuck with a clean recording.When cross-genre music is done, the results can be spectacular, (Rhasphody in Blue, Beatles, Symphonic Pink Floyd...) or it could be a neat but undistinctive piece like this one."
3,DMA Magazine Review,"A touch of culture has made its way to clubland, and this mixture of beats and opera should have your dance floor captivated."
3,not exactly what you'd expect.,"when i saw an ad for this on nerve, i was kind of interested, mostly for how much i'd liked the diva remix from TFE, and the cover work alone. when i popped it in and did a quick spin through it, i found about 1/3rd of the tracks are just boring dribble, but the rest were very well mixed and well produced.the track 'in the city' is probably the climax of the album. check it out."
3,"First few songs are good, the rest are???","First few songs are good, but the rest of the album is no good!"
2,Not the Organic Guide Expected,"With the modern movement in place for organic, natural living, I thought this may touch on the subject, saving the reader from a more simplistic country standard (which the books are chock full of this). I was wrong. This is just another country title. Avoid at all costs."
4,Restrained,"Now that Stephen Plaistow has annointed this recording in hisBBC programme ""Building a Library,"" sales of Christian Zacharias's recording should jump. Restraint isn't a bad thing, and Z's recordings are well-turned (though he seems almost embarrassed by the ornaments at times). This approach works well for K 402 and OK for most of the sonatas on this recording. But K 519, and Scarlatti in general, needs more bottle.A number of other Scarlatti recordings by Michael Lewin (steel fingers), Benjamin Frith (lyricism), and Cristiana Pegoraro (just joy) reveal the passion and flamboyance that Z's recording lacks."
1,Wrong book,"I got the wrong book. Same title, different author. The book was listed with the wrong picture. Not worth the cost of returning. Just a word of caution."
1,Waste of Money,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased. I had the same issues as everyone else, the strap doesn't connect, the strings are too loose and break when trying to tighten. I am online now trying how to figure out how to return. What a disappointment for my daughter on Christmas morning."
1,Too much trouble,"Austin Bazaar did not have one of the guitars I wanted in stock. They were really nice about changing my order; however, I never recieved my goods. I tried several days to get in touch with Austin Bazaar and theyresponded one time and said that Fed-ex said my stuff was delivered. For three days after that, I tried to contact Austin Bazaar and they would not respond. I had to file an A-Z claim with Amazon to get my money refunded. I will NEVER order anything from Austin Bazaar again!"
1,"25"" Kid's Toy Guitar with Carrying Bag and Accessories","I bought one of these, one my daughter. I try to tighten the strings, and they dont stay tight. I you tighten too much, the strings break. What a waste of money!!!she was not happy"
4,Nice for the price.,"This is a really cute guitar and perfect for the price. Don't get me wrong, you're not going to be able to bust out some Lenny Kravits with this thing, but it does hold its tune pretty well and actually looks a bit better than the pic. Not too small, not too big. would be perfect for a average build girl 10 years or older. Any younger and I personally feel that it would be too big for a childs small body structure"
5,Love it,Bought this for my niece a couple years ago and it still works! It is a great product at a great price and the colour and case made it even better
4,an anthology not to be missed,"In my opinion, Brava picked out three great authors for this anthology. While Donna Kauffman takes you to a Carribbean island, Janelle Denison reunites two people during a game of poker. While I enjoyed both of these stories, Ms. Denison's heroine is too easily sacrificed by her older brothers in my opinion. The final story in this book belongs to Lori Foster. A sweet innocent surprises the experienced hero with the wish to explore bondage."
4,Surprised I liked it.,"To my surprise I really liked this book. When I ordered it, I thought it was going to be a discussion on why women lean toward ""Bad Boys"". When I discovered it was just a collection of racy stories I put it away on the shelf to read when I had nothing else to read. I never really cared too much for short stories. To my surprise it was pretty decently written. The first story kind of reminded me why I did not like short racy stories, but about half way through it, I had changed my mind. I really enjoyed the last two stories and will probably look for more from those two writers. All three were very graphic, but had the sweet ending that I am always a sucker for."
2,Not so hot...,I've read better in this series. These 3 stories were weak. No feelings of anticipation just wanted to get over reading it.
4,Bad Boys is definitely a good fit for Bad Girls!,Three short stories that are perfect for sunbathing by the pool or at the beach...
3,Lori Foster was hot as always...,"I gave this book 3 stars because, Lori Foster's story was the best of the three. Donna Kauffman's story was so-so, but Janelle's was just plain awful in my opinion."
3,Liked first and last,All three stories were steamy. The first and third had something of a storyline and a sense of humor.IMHO Janelle Denison should stick with historical romances- the male character actually uses the word 'vixen'.
2,"Too much sex, too little story","Like a couple of others who reviewed this book, I thought there was too much sex and too little story. The Lori Foster one was by far the best, and the one by Janelle Denison should have just been submitted to Penthouse Forum. This would have been a better trilogy if it had just been the three books from Foster's story of three friends who have a dare going about the sex shop across from their office."
4,Roger Rabbit Rules!,"The funniest cartoon rabbit since Bugs Bunny is back in his own short cartoons; Tummy Trouble, Roller Coaster Rabbit and Trail Mix-up. All three has a lot of funny moments with Roger getting in to trouble as he tries to save Baby Herman. My brother excplained to me that this movie was very difficult to find. So you better buy it quik before it goes out of sale igain.The cartoon Tummy Trouble was orginally showed togetter with ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids""."
5,Making the world laugh,"This viedo is the best christmas present I have ever gotten! I am ironically a babysitter and I take the video with me and show it to all the brats I watch. One Dutch girl I babysit watches it every time I come over. She can't speak a word of englsh, yet she still laughs histarcally every time the roller coaster fall apart and Roger's feet burn up from the friction of the Coaster Tracks!"
4,Exactly what I needed!,Love this item. It is definitively worth the money and it arrived fairly quick. I like the sturdiness of the pot.
3,Never in a million years had Grant expected this...,"His late wife, Ally, speaking on a memory videotape she'd left behind, was actually suggesting he start dating.""Date?"" Grant thought alound. ""Who would I date? Who wants a widower who lives on a principal's salary and has three daughters?""Clearly anticipating his reaction, Ally said into the camera, ""I know you're going to sit around for weeks saying you wouldn't know who to ask if you wanted to go on a date. I've though this out, too.""She leaned forward in the chair. ""Jenna,"" she said softly. ""I want you to date my best friend, Jenna. And, Grant, I think you'll fall in love with her."""
2,The Indian Captive,"The Indian CaptiveWas not that interesting for me. Hard to get into the story, even skimming through it so it will not be kept."
4,The Indian Captive A Narrative of the adventures and sufferings of,Pretty good and seemed to be pretty factual.. Having spent some time in Arizona I find this intersting as I love cowboys.
5,Better than I expected......,I thought this would be childish and corny. Wrong!Either Brayton had an excellent ghostwriter and imagination or he wrote a good account of a mythical subject. Won't see this in many school libraries.By the way I may be related to Mathew in some fashion. That's why I got interested in the title.B L Brayton Southern Californiaby the way we lived for a few short years in St Anthony
1,BOY CAPTURED. BY Indians and. How he survived.,TH I S WAS A VERY. GOOD BOOK. THE HISTORICAL part ls good.I would Recommend to other people to read.
3,Nice Short Read,"Good story, not as many details as I wanted but still a good read. Well worth the time and the book does explain some Indian customs of the day. Overall three stars."
5,buy this case,The samsung galaxy note is an investment and This little case jusT protected my investmen a drop from at least 6 feet to the ground.
1,Absolute CRAP!,"This product is NOT what it says it is.The thing was shipped broken (piece by the volume button), does not fit the phone, and is constructed of the cheapest material I have ever touched.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! It was a nightmare from the beginning. I managed to finally put my Galaxy Note in the cheap plastic/rubber ""phone case"" and it slid out so many times, that the credibility of this product was over. After I dropped my phone (on carpet) and the case came off! I shouldnt have on carpet!!!DO NOT PUT YOUR $650.00+ PHONE IN THIS PRODUCT!You will be greatly disappointed. The title is a lie.... IT DOES NOT FIT THE SAMSUNG GALAZY NOTE!Thanks for reading!"
4,A slim goodie!,A very pretty case that adds color and decent protection without a lot of bulk. The extra padded corners is a really nice touch.
2,its a 2 piece protector and the plastic piece,wont stay aligned... very frustrating. having to use with only the rubber piece. would not reccomend to anyone to buy
3,Trail Hat,"I like the coverage that this hat gives and the color is close to the pictue, so it does not stand out as badly as one that might be tan. The fit is good, but I may just not be a hat person as the shape looks awkward for my face shape. Granted I don't wear anything other than basebal caps. So it may just be me. I will wear it regardless because of the feel and the protection. I have to guard my face from the sun as I'm healing from hyperpigmentation. So for that I really do like the hat."
3,Some issues...,"I wasn't thrilled with this book. I found it a little didactic (albeit in an overly breezy style)--not the book for people who aren't sure about natural birth; it'll make middle-of-the-road moms feel inadequate.The style is blog-like and too personal to the author at times for an instructive book, in my opinion. The section that's nothing more than quoted emails is interesting for a couple of pages, then becomes overkill; I felt like I was reading a message board.I noted numerous typographical errors (including a major one in statistics that was corrected with an errata sticker), which detracted from the professionalism of the book.The section on Cytotec is excellent, with an appropriately firm stance, and the facts and documents to back that up."
5,Highly Recommended,"Hey! Who's Having This Baby Anyway is an exceptional guide to intelligent birth. The material is presented in an upbeat and fast-paced format, and never leaves the reader feeling dry. Highly recommended for anyone planning to have a baby ... after all, if you don't know about your choices, you don't have any!"
5,Hey! Who's Having This Baby Anyway?,"Knowledge is power! This well written book provides great information on the many choices and options childbearing couples have, so that they can make informed decisions about their childbirth experience. This knowledge empowers the confident mom-to-be and her partner to seek out the birth experience that they desire. I would recommend this book to all pregnant couples interested in a ""normal"" birth! Susan Stevens,LCCE, CD(DONA) Hickory NC"
5,Best EVER book for Pregnant women!,"When I first got my copy of this book, I jumped for joy. This is the first book that spells out the choices pregnant women have to make for the birth of their babies! As a birth doula, childbirth educator and lactation educator, this book is required reading for my clients. You won't be disappointed...in fact, you too will jump for joy knowing you are making the best decisions for the most important event of your life! Thank you Breck...I only wish this book was available when I was pregnant with my babies. My choices would have been different. As a consumer, women have the RIGHT to chose how and where to birth her baby, not the health care providers. This book helps you make those choices, by giving you the information and tools to choose to have your birth YOUR way."
5,Hey! This is a GREAT BOOK!,"As a Birth Doula, I highly recommend this book and have 3 to lend to my clients. Breck's book informs pregnant Mom's & Dads of their options in Childbirth. She tells them what their care provider probably won't and helps them to make informed decisions. The workbook style at the end of every chapter is brilliant.This is clearly one of the most clear and concise book on your options for having your baby in today's world.2 Thumbs up for a job well done!"
2,Manufacture failure,"I Bought these punches and returned them due to the reduced quality. The punched I received appeared to be machined from bar stock not forged. The handles were hex shank not knurled and the pin shaft was considerably shorter than the punches I thought I was buying.In all fairness the seller gave me a full refund after determining that this was a change by the manufacturer that was not reflected in the description.For those who don't know SK Tools went bankrupt a few years ago and was bought by Ideal Tools. The guarantee is now subject to an excrusiating review that I don't believe any tool that has to be sent in for replacement could pass.I recommend that for those looking for roll pin punches either buy a cheap set or spend the big buck and buy Starrett, Mayhew or Snap-On."
5,Room on the 3rd Floor,I think this is an exellent song one of there best. With great vocals and fantastic musical skills mcfly totally rock well done McFly
3,good at first...,"I have a larger santoku knife that I love, so I was delighted to find a smaller version. However, this knife rusted after the first use and the blade dulled quickly. I would not recommend this product. Spend a little more and get a real knife that will last."
5,Good Intermediate Book,"If you already have a basic understanding of the Korean language, then this book is the next step. It has readings pertaining to the Korean culture, along with vocabulary and grammar studies. I had been waiting for a long time for a book like this. Too bad there aren't many good Korean books out there like this one."
2,Very standard,"A typical old style reader. There are a number of problems. The texts are not interesting. Even though the title is Modern Korean there is too much emphasis on things of little interest to me like Korean festivals, folk tales etc. I prefer authentic content about real people, or history or other adult material. I find the examples, drills and exercises useless.I need to read and listen. I want a good word list with the odd explanation and then more content. What I do need is an audio version of every chapter, either on CD or available for download on the Internet. Unfortunately this book is one of only two intermediate readers I have found. Both are about the same."
1,rusting issue with stainless pasta pot,"I have a stainless Phillippe Richard pasta pot. The insert began rusting right away and the now the inside of the pot is rusting, too. It now needs to be replaced and I've had it less than 6 months. I had no issues with the glass lid, but I can't cook in a lid and I would not recommend Phillippe Richard products."
2,EXPLOSION!!!!!!,"I have had this cookware set for 3 or 4 years and they did fine, but in the last couple months two of my four lids have exploded. One exploded while I was using it on the stove and the other exploded while sitting in my dish drainer. It had been sitting there for two days without any change of temperature to cause the explosion. I threw my other glass lids away before they had a chance to do the same. Has anyone else run into this problem?"
5,A book to read,This book is a vademecum in the conservation history for every conservator. It is easy to read and follow with lot of useful information!
5,Step by Step easy instructions,"This book was great for an intro to GIS class. At times the instructions were TOO step by step and made you feel like a 5 year old, but better too many instructions than too few. I feel I have a pretty good grasp on basic GIS now after having the book. Also, I would not have been able to go through the class without the book."
2,Echo Prior,"An earlier comment reported, ""it doesn't address theory of GIS programs in general that well, and I felt like my hand was being held a little too much in some things."" I certainly agree. The book is simply a series of examples. The examples are repetitive in part. There is very little explanation. Using up 10 pages to demonstrate drag-and-drop functions is really not necessary."
4,"Getting to Know ArcGIS Desktop: The Basics of ArcView, ArcEditor, and ArcInfo Updated for ArcGIS 9 (Getting to Know series)","The best part about this book is it included the ArcGIS 9 + extension w/ 6 months free licence. I bought this book for around $36, so I guess it's really worth it."
4,Good primer for ArcGIS,"I used this book for an online GIS course through the University of Washington and found the contents to be very helpful. The step-by-step process is instructive and helps to gain an understanding of the basic functions of ArcGIS.Conversely, there are times when the book does not give enough detail to allow for troubleshooting. I found there were situations that arose in certain processes that the book did not cover, even though I was following the step-by-step process."
2,Not current,This features the software and instruction for 9.2. The newest version is 9.3. I had to return this and get the newer version to keep up with my class.
2,Not The Easiest Way To Learn This Program,"I read this book over and over to no avail. I finally called in our County GIS Agent to come out and show me how it's done. Learned the program in a few days by watching her. The book makes it somewhat confusing to comprehend. If you can learn this program hands-on, you're a lot better off."
3,Vista incompatability.,I purchased the software for a class and found out the software doesn't work on Vista. Not anyones fault but my own. So although the book is required and provides reading the ability for me to do software excercises is nil on my computer.The purchase process was fast and I was pleased with the quickness of delivery. The book is new and overall I am happy with the outcome.
3,Not Compatible,"GIS is an amazing program and the book does a great job teaching you how to do almost everything.BUT, the software isn't compatible with Windows Vista or Macs - which is a huge inconvenience for me."
4,It's good for people to begin to learn ArcGIS,"I purposed it one month ago as the text book in my lab class.Now, I have almost finished all parts.It's very useful for you to learn the detailed information about the Arc tools.It includes two CDs which I used to do my exercises.It's a good book for the GIS beginer."
3,ARCGIS,"This is worth the $4 it cost, but since it describes a hands-on tutorial, it is pretty inadequate minus the demo CD that comes with a new one."
1,"Using ""Getting to Know ArcGIS Desktop""","This book is very user friendly and concepts are well explained. However, some single exercise instructions contain too many steps which one can easily skip or confuse with other things. Such instructional steps could be made as simple and as many as possible."
2,it does not work for me,"i encountered problems doing the exercises at chapter 10b and from there things got worse. once i got to chapter 11, i could no longer do the exercises and i can't figure out why not. i am not familiar with gis ... and this was to be my introduction on how to do the basics. now i am stuck."
1,Irresponsible.,"Seller couldn't even account for the item they were trying to sell. The seller didn't have the common courtesy to email me when the order was placed and let me know that the item was unavailable, had to find out when I inquired about the shipping status several days later. Not sure why the item was still available for purchase if they didn't have it in their possession. It's unfortunate that I actually had to give them one star to post this review..."
5,"moving & meaningful, yet accessible","i don't typically enjoy collections of written poetry...for me, much of the nuance in a poem is conveyed through reading a piece or hearing it read. this book is an exception, though...the poems are meaningful, and they carry great emotional weight, and yet they are still accessible in their written form. the writing is abstract enough to keep the poems from being dully literal, and yet there are plenty of ""hooks"" which the reader can use to find personal meaning. this collection is highly recommended!"
2,A Talent for Over-writing,"Brian Teare's poetry has stunning music and this creates a haunting irony given the personal pain he describes. Individual lines have gorgeous aural effects, but the cumulation is often overwrought, overdone. The poems go on long after they end, as does the book. And as much as he enjoys flaunting his impressive linguistic prowess, he enjoys even more excavating his grief in as many words as possible. This is unsettling, to say the least. (Is he writing to release the demons or writing to show off how cleverly he can release the demons?) The poems could be cleaner and the book could be about twenty-odd pages shorter."
5,R.C. Sabuda's pop-up books,"Ever since Sabuda published his book, America the Beautiful, I have been giving his pop-up books asholiday gifts. The recipients love them and look forward to seeing what comes next. They won't be disapointed by the latest gift they will receive in December, the Christmas Alphabet book. It is everybit as creative and beautiful as his other books. Also, the books were on sale so I purchased them in July for December. Of course, I save a book for myself. My artist friends really appreciate the skill needed to create the books. Thanks Robert Clarke Sabuda for the joy the books have given many of the children and adults in my life."
5,Beautiful Gift Book for Christmas,"This is a simple, yet beautiful book of pop-up paper scultptures, each representing a theme from A to Z. It is not a book for young children, but rather for an older child or an adult who appreciates simple elegance and dramatic paper sculptures. This is also a great book for people who like to collect alphabet books. It also makes a beautiful ""coffee table book"" during the holiday season."
3,THE BEST ABC BOOK EVER,"I wish that they had this book when I was in Kindergarten learning my ABCs. It is so colorful and it truly excited me about the holiday. It definitely exemplifies the true meaning of Christmas. As a prospective teacher, I intend to use it every Christmas."
1,"Great book, but all were damaged","This book is really nice, but arrived with smudges and spots (looked like mold) on most of the pages. I bought 3 of these that I sent back, but the replacements arrived damaged as well. All have gone back. What a disappointment."
5,Beautiful gift,"I personally have a number of Robert Sabuda pop-up books. I find them amazing each and every time I open one. This particular book was purchased as a Christmas gift for a dear friend's son. I received high praise on the book from my friend and her husband as thier son was fascinated by the pop ups. This book is not as elaborate as some of his others, like The Night before Christmas, but was great for a little one still learning his ABCs (with a parent helping him open the pop up doors!)"
5,pop-up,A fun holiday book for young readers. But artwork and craftsmanship will awe and fascinate viewers of all ages. Robert Sabuda's books are always high quality and expertly crafted.
4,Christmas pop-up book,"It's nice, but doesn't fold back in easily -- but as one of many Christmas books, it's a good one."
1,Not up to Sabuda's standards,"I own six other pop-up books by Robert Sabuda and have been pleased with every one: THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS, THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS, THE WIZARD OF OZ, AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL, THE BOOK OF DINOSAURS,and ALICE IN WONDERLAND. I have been charmed by all of these and had convinced myself that anything by Robert Sabuda was not to be missed. I was wrong. The little pop-ups on THE CHRISTMAS ALPHABET do not compare in any way with the others, and there is literally no text whatsoever. This book is flat, colorless, and has no ""wow"" moments at all, which is what is so delightful about all of the others. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Simply the best!,"This group is awesome. I recommend this CD and also any of their other projects as well. ""Through The Fire"" is my favorite."
5,The Authoritative Text on Continuous Phase Modulation,"This text deals with continuous-phase modulation from several important angles --- CPM design based on maximization of the minimum Euclidean distance and spectral bandwidth; analysis of various approaches of optimum and suboptimum CPM demodulation, etc.This is THE place to start on the topic of CPM. This remains for me THE book to return time and again in my CPM research."
2,"Hey dude, where's my tide chart?","I've had one of these watches for about two years. While it's fine as far as watches go, be careful where you want to use it. It does not have all the tide charts that are listed in the owners manual.I know for a fact that it does not have the Seattle/Puget Sound area in it, even though the manual says it has several beaches in that area. Which by the way is one of the reasons I bought the watch, as I used to scuba dive there.I contacted Freestyle about this, and they said they were aware of the problem, yet they didn't feel it necessary to do anything about it, or inform potential customers. So sorry.Before you buy one, go to a store and try to find the tide chart you want in the watch itself before you buy one. If it has the charts you want, great. It's a handy feature to have, and otherwise a fine watch."
4,Good so far,I have had this watch for approx. 2 years now and it has worked fine. The tide function is very accurate for the area i live in which is NC. The only problem I have had with it is the band broke and I had to replace it. Other than that it has worked well.
4,Unique album and a really nice listen,"I bought this album on vinyl while traveling in London during the Winter of 1999. Been looking for a digital copy for the last few years. Really nice record and a great debut. The follow-up album wasn't as good IMO. I'm not sure why the small labels aren't digitizing their back catalog, although it has to be cost related. Seems a shame that the diversity of these small, but great titles would be lost to future listeners."
3,Victorian depravity -- much sanitized,"This is a genteel tale with a heart warming protagonist and a nicely complex villain. The strong suit of this book, in fact, is its creation of characters. What's less strong is its plotting and the superficiality of the author's picture of Victorian society. Like like his clerical detective, the author seems unwilling to look squalor in the eye. If you want to feel the period go elsewhere, for instance to Michael Faber's The Crimson Petal and the White."
3,Good finds but needs a serious editor,"Kaie's book includes some good finds with a real local eye but her writing needs a serious edit. The text, while short, is full of misused it's/its and at least one there/their/they're problem. But overlook that and it's a nice introduction"
5,Excellent Master System game,This is an excellent game for the Sega Master System. Well worth any reasonable price to pay. A great game to add to anyone's collection.
4,A lot of fun...light hearted and romantic,"I guess I'm a sucker for movies where the boy longs for a particular kind of girl and finds his true love in the end. Even though this movie doesn't spend much time on whether or not Krista Allen's character's hair color is changing her love life (because so much more is going on than that), it's a movie with its heart in the right place...and we get to see Krista Allen as more than a one dimensional character. (Yes, she really can act!) There are a couple of things about the plot that are a little unexpected (hey, this isn't Citizen Kane), but overall the people making it seemed to be enjoying themselves...and the ending is very sweet.Michael Buble's singing is also terrific (especially if you're a Sinatra fan like me). I recommend you plug his name into iTunes and see all the albums he's released since this movie. Great singing!I've added this movie to my DVD collection and will watch it whenever I feel like dreaming of meeting the right lady for me."
3,"Didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either...","The thing that gets me the most about this movie is...in what alternate universe is Krista Allen not hot? She actually looks worse as a blonde, but I digress. The plots not exactly the most original thing I've ever seen, but it's enjoyable with a few funny moments. Michael Buble is really the best reason to watch. His voice is amazing. The scenes in the club are great. Bottom line...this movie won't change your life but it's not a complete waste of time."
2,Michael Buble Only Redeeming Factor,"I watched this movie only to see Michael Buble. Everything in this movie was disappointing except Michael's voice. The songs were not up to his class, however--quite disappointing. The female star in this movie is awful. How did Michael get into this mess of a movie? He is also much better looking than this movie shows him."
3,"Michael, Michael, Michael!! :-)","Although the movie Totally Blonde wasn't all that great, Michael Buble was awesome! He was the best actor in the movie. I love his voice!. I have his c.d It's Time, and everyone should go out and get it. Me and my friend watched this movie a couple of days ago, because we were having a Michael Buble-athon. lol.This movie is alright, but the reason why we keep on watching it is because of Michael!"
2,Dreadful - with one saving grace,"This film is generally dreadful - with a simplistic plot, an obnoxious herione, and only one good laugh (it involves a Canadian Mountie). Yet, as others have said, the saving grace is Michael Buble. His singing is wonderful and he may have some potential as an actor. Unfortunately, the film doesn't isolate its chapters so one could zoom from one Buble song to the next and skip this badly written film."
1,On my top 10 list of worst movies I've ever seen,"Before I'm accused of hating blonde movies, let me state for the record that I gave ""Legally Blonde"" 4 stars. It deserved it. ""Totally Blonde"", on the other hand, looks and feels for the most part like it was written, directed, and acted by a bunch of kids freshly flunked out of film school. It goes wrong in so many different ways that I can't even begin to list them here. (OK, I can: acting, writing, directing...) At one particularly low point in the movie the director seems to realize that the best thing he has going for him (I assume it's a male...I can't believe a female could portray women so poorly) is Allen's breasts and so he decides to focus in on them (literally) in several scenes that could have come straight out of a low-budget porn flick.If you're feeling overly intelligent and want to lower your IQ a little, here's the perfect tool to do it with."
2,Watch this movie only if your a Michael Buble Fan!,"That was the only reason that I purchased this movie was so that I can watch Michael Buble....other than that, this movie wasn't very good at all. Krista Allen plays this woman that can't pick the right guy, and when the right guy (Michael Buble) comes along, she's not interested in him. He plays a really nice guy in the movie. I didn't find this movie to be funny although it tried to be funny, it was more corny! So, only get this movie if your a Michael Buble Fan! I paid less than $7."
3,Totally Blonde 'moment',"Bought this due to being a big fan of Michael Buble. My daughter has called this the worst movie she's ever seen, and she's seen her share. Maybe it's not the best of movies, but I've seen worse. I'm happy with it."
5,great product,"Just as described, simple and easy to install. Would do business with these folks again, will recommend to anyone needing to replace their boat's fuel tank and guage."
4,Do you know? You'd rather do.,"I believe that information is the most important thing for anyone in all circunstances. When you are informed you can do better choices.This book brings you informations that normally remain under the clouds of tecnical and chemical names. Do you know what is in your shampoo? You should! Other very useful book is ""Unreasonable risk"" from Dr. Samuel Epstein."
4,Save Your Skin,"I ordered this book a few years ago as I was struggling with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. This book motivated me to replace all our cosmetic and personal care items with non-toxic and organic ones.In reply to the woman who would have liked to have had some alternatives listed, I agree. The recent trend towards more organic products is admirable but there are a lot of ""greenwash"" products out there so be sure to read labels. EWG has a good dictionary of cosmetic ingredients now and listings of thousands of products in varying categories from toxic to less toxic to least toxic.Judi, how about a revised edition with product listings?"
1,DEFINETELY not The Wedding Present,"After listening (and loving) to The Wedding Present's ""Sea Monsters"" and ""Bizarro"" I thought I'd check out Gedge's latest material. Big mistake. To be honest I didn't even give the CD a full listen. I ALWAYS give a CD at least two listens before passing judgement. But this was so bad, that I only got to track five or six before I had to turn it off. If you like syrup dipped in honey you might enjoy Cinerama. If you are expecting the frenetic, impassioned, rockin guitar driven pop of TWP then don't touch this album.Maybe Gedge should drop the girlfriend, the keyboard and the drum machine and pick up a guitar again."
1,"Does what it says, but the sound quality is horrible!","First off, you need to rip apart your dash board to hard-wire install this into your car's power system, which isn't so bad if you know what your doing. Secondly, it constantly has a stream of static that protrudes through the music at all times and especially when at a stoplight intersection that has a magnet under the pavement for detecting traffic and whenever you are using anything else in the car that requires electricity like the ac or the heater (the higher you turn up the fan, the louder the static gets). The only way I have found to circumvent this is to turn the bass way up, and the treble way down. This is ok for me because this is the way I like my music but for anyone else, its probably not a good way to go. All around, it does give me my music, but it doesn't give good sound quality at all."
3,"It works, but installation was confusing.","This product works as advertised, but installation was confusing... the instructions were lackluster at best. I would suggest that anyone considering this product need to know a good deal about electrical wiring in the vehicle for installation... there is splicing involved. Otherwise, the sound is crisp and only rarely gets any interference."
3,Pyle 7-channel Modualtor,"This thing probably works fine but it's a lot of work to install. First you have to tear your dash out to get to the radiio antenna...that's ok, it's possible, then the radio antenna and this device does not have the same kind of connection, so you have to go get an adapter or rewire somehow, you have to find a hot wire somewhere under the dash to connect it to but it has to be a switchd hot wire or it will run your battery down. After all that I got it to work for a week and now I think one of the wires must have come loose and I have to go back under the dash to find out what's the problem. I'm sure it's my fault but be ware, it's not a plug and play item.They did ship fast and it is reasonably priced."
3,Excellent playing but somewhat plain composition,"AMG's rating is 4- 4 & half, but I think this is over-estimated. AMG's rating is always very kind. I think every musicians' playing are very excellent, but original compositions are somewhat plain."
4,"Not bad, not bad at all","I still have yet to use it for its intended purpose, but so far it has served me well. It stands up to its claim, but get ready to get your brain dirty. Maybe its because I like basic reverb effects that aren't full of crazy options. I still have yet to figure out how to efficiently use the routing feature. Its there though, and Im sure it serves a purpose. I was really looking for a less complicated Reverb Processor.I originally intended to use this as a final between the Mixer and PA Amp, but due to the lack of time most of the bands around here put into practice, I haven't had much time to work on all that. It serves me well in the recording process, but that is a sterile environment where I can control everything with the push of a delete button.All and all I would recommend it to anyone that has a basic grasp on using reverb. IF you have never used something this in depth, just get ready to get your brain dirty. It still works well and is loaded with features though."
5,definitely a drill bit.,"bought to install tactile switches in xbox 360 controllers for duplicating ABXY to the underside as well as rapid fire chip functions, works exactly as planned, bua haha."
2,Not the wok I'd hoped for,Unlike some other reviewers I am not happy with this product. The handles DO get hot ... so much so that I needed a pot holder to hold onto them. And I needed to hold onto them because the wok is easily tipped. The edge of the rim was rough and likely to cut a finger had I used with it much more. It will instead find its way into the garage sale pile and I will find something better to cook with.
3,Could be better,"I do a lot of wok cooking and am always looking for the perfect wok. While this wok works fine, it has a few drawbacks. First, even though I followed the seasoning directions exactly, the wok is still not seasoned as well as I feel it should be --- even after heavy usage for over a year. After each use and cleaning, rust spots continue to appear if I don't wipe and oil it immediately. Additionally,vegetables as well as meat and poultry being stir fried tend to stick to some of the surface areas and a heavy duty scrubbing is needed to remove the residue -- this is exacerbated when seasoning is used. Lastly, the handles heat up very quickly, unlike the wooden handles."
2,Coatings,"Although the steel is a little thin, the two big problems are surfaces and coatings.The inside of the wok is not smooth but shows the indentations of the fabrication. Food tends to stick and burn in these uneven surfaces.The bigger problem is the coating on both the inside and outside. I started to season the wok and immediately smoke and an unpleasant smell started pouring off the wok. There is a thick sticky coating that required at least a half hour of scrubbing with ""Googone"" to remove.I would have much preferred a smooth cooking surface and no coating. After all is said and done, it's just okay."
5,excelente,excelentye producto muy bueno pero quisiera saber como curarlo para tener un mayor rendimiento del mismo sarten wok que me vendiron espero su mas pronta respuesta gracias
2,THIS RELEASE IS TAKEN FROM THE VINYL LP,"A great lost classic for sure, but does anyone who bought this, realise that this is transfered & cleaned up (a little) from an LP? Alot of ""Ticks"" & some ""Pops"", are clearly noticable throughout the CD. The giveaway is the begining of Track 7. (Open The Door To Your Heart) A big scratch going round & round at the head of the tune. It doesn't state anywhere in the booklet,that this remaster is from the old LP.Shame on you Brunswick Kats!"
3,"Great Sound, Shallow writing.","What a great tone on the soprano. Intonation is impeccable and Marion can produce extrodinarily long phrases with his circular breathing. Improvisation sections become stale and repetative with few interesting chordal suprises, but I guess this is not a requirement for smooth jazz. Beats are awesome and moods relaxing and romantic. I've heard Marion compared to Kenny G, but he is, in my opinion, far superior to kenny's whining tone. If you like this albumn and are looking for a little more depth, you would probably enjoy Branford Marsalis: Requiem"
5,LOVE Shaun T workouts,"We started doing Insanity 1.5 years ago. After going through the program 2 times, Asylum was released and we've been going between Insanity and Asylum since December 2011. We were already in great shape from consistent weight training for over 20 years. This took us to another level! We actually stopped going to the gym earlier this year because these workouts are all that we need to stay in excellent shape. I have never been so strong! My cardio is awesome and I can't even tell you how many push ups I'm able to do. We just purchased Asylum 2 and are now beginning week #2. I didn't think things could get any more intense - but I was wrong! Gameday is one of the funnest and challenging workouts I've ever done. These videos are worth EVERY penny."
2,Not worth the high price,"while i must say i paid less than the original asking price of the first insanity dvd set, i still believe this set is not worth what they are asking for. 6 dvds and a few tools for $112? the exercising is awesome don't get me wrong but the first set had waaaaaay more depth to it."
2,not what I wanted,This was the 2nd of the series and not the original Insanity. I bought it for my daughter but this particular item was the 2nd int the series. she hadnt even gone through the first series. I didnt know
3,not relaxing,"I put this CD on hoping for help relaxing, but turned it off after only a few minutes, because it was not helping. It would have been fine except for one insistent bird call that ruined the whole effect. It was as if you were there in the jungle hearing all these sounds like an orchestra, but just a few feet away is this raucous, discordant, racket disrupting the whole thing. If this particular sound had been blended with the others instead of so much louder it probably would have been okay. I haven't listened to the whole thing so maybe it improves in later sections."
2,Disappointing,"The compilers of this CD seemed to select about the worst music available for this CD. Also, it sounded to me like mostly the ""New"" Statesmen; there was very little, if any, of Jake Hess, or anything that I recognized of the Original Statesmen.Of course, it had the ultimate plus: the Original Hovie Lister. But I don't think they were at their best here."
3,What was Jimmy Thinking?,"Maynard Ferguson devotees will, by themselves, make this CD a best seller, if they ever find out he is on it, which the liner notes do nothing to help clarify. His playing is not used to it's best advantage, but it is a great example of the self-discipline that green-faced detractors have historically denied he posesses. Charlie Teagarden's solos are SWEEEEEEET!"
2,"good CD--not great, but good","This is a very nice CD. Alot of the arrangements have been slightly to moderately revised from their original form, I think making the music much more interesting to listen to. Overall, the group sounds very polished--they are certainly having fun, Dorsey is in good form, and the choice of music is ok. The sound quality is very nice, indeed. The interview is wonderful; if you are a Dorsey fan you will appreciate this man's humility!! This is a very good CD for the Dorsey fan. There are better, but this CD deserves a solid 4 stars!"
2,Changing Faces has changed,"I brought this new CD based on my love of their old work, and I must say I was truly dissapointed. I guess if any R Kelly associated artist or group has shown they need his midas touch, it's changing faces. They have lovely voices, but the production was weak on too many of their tracks. I'm getting tired of buying cds only to find two or three good songs on them. People need to take time on their product rather than rushing out and having their stuff released when it's below the buying public's standards. I really think that the music industry is focusing on the young consumer, who really doesn't have an ear for true quality music yet. I'll give them this though, the cover caught my eye. But it's what's inside that really matters."
1,what a dissapointment,Not only did I waste money but I wasted my time listening to this CD. I thought that they were making progress but I was wrong. Their first CD was okay and the second was great but 'Visit Me' is terrible. It was one sappy sad song after another. The only decent song was 'That other woman' which was the main reason I bought it. It seems to me that Cassaundra and Charrise aren't trying to grow as artist. Just because they're singing about heartache doesn't mean that I believe that they feel what they are singing about. Anyway its time for more upbeat music or at least a bit more happier songs. Bottom line their next CD will have to be the bomb for me to buy it.
5,Its outstanding,"Man i brought this cd not thinkin it would be this incredible. I like every song on the album. Im I know that joe produced some songs and david hollister produced a song and sings it it also its called called""I told you""and that is one of the best R &B; songs I ever heard in my life.I notice that the song come over is exactly the same song aliyah recorded.I dont know who made it first.It pretty much sounds the same to. Their first 2 cd got more air play than this one but this is the best on.Maybe they should have released a different songs. But this cd is solid."
1,I am so disgusted with this CD,"Besides ""Other woman,"" all the songs sound the same. They're a bunch of sappy love songs that have been heard before. They have no originality or personality to them. Don't waste your money."
1,These appear to be fake - not the genuine products from Gillette,"My face was in pain when I used the blade and it was the same painful experience each time I used the next three days - so I stopped using. I went and bought the same variety of blades from Target and I am loving it, and my experience is painless. I think the blades I received are either used blades which have been recycled or they are fake copies of the genuine product. I will never buy blades from this supplier or for that matter, from Amazon. I am happy to buy them locally from a reputable store."
2,Too Expensive,I paid way too much for these cartridges. I found them later on at Walgreens for 1/2 the price Gem charged.
4,"A great watch, but . . .","This is a really good watch. One reviewer said that he wished it was a little larger, but I think it is a good size (and I generally like large watches). It makes a great dress watch.My one reservation is the band. The way the leather is textured causes it to bend more sharply in certain places (one place in particular on my own watch). I would probably think that this was a fluke, but you can notice it on the watch in the above picture. Notice that there is a kink in the band on the middle picture above. On my watch, there is a similar kink which seems to be in about the same place. This causes the watch to want to ride slightly off center on my wrist. The face of the watch doesn't remain straight while I'm wearing it. This is a mild irritant to me. However, someone else might find it more bothersome.This is one of three Invicta watches that I own. They are generally very good watches and very much worth the money."
5,Van Cliburn in Moscow #1,This was like going to heaven -- listening to Cliburn and seeing Kondrashin conduct -- I'm so grateful this has been released on DVD
4,Churchill's revenge,"is interesting, factual and graphic. appears to be historically correct, helps to understand the horror of the last days of the war."
2,Sloppy - Hobby Historian,"Sloppy history --- with basic inaccuracies such as those cited by the 5 star reviewer (???), how can the analysis be trusted as sound? Dissapointing book all around. When one sets out to challenge (dare I say ""revise"") history, and Taylor is the revisionist here, one would expect better all around scholarship. Even from its promotional ""Editorial Review"" - the book is designed to stir controversy rather than add to serious historical scholarship."
3,Too chatty but interesting,"This book deals too much with the personal lives of many of the Dresden residents. The reader is more interested in their descriptions of the event than their life stories. However, the author does a good job of demonstrating that this bombing was no different than any other WWII area bombing. A good portrait of Sir Arthur Harris, who tried to protect his nation as he knew best, and got far less credit than he deserved. British officers made far more mistakes than Harris and received more honor after the war."
5,Superb and courageous history,"I whole-heartedly recommned this book to anyone interested in WWII and getting behind the post-war propaganda. What really happened to Dresden and why has been buried for half a century under agendas--first by the Nazis themselves and later by the Soviets. If we don't understand history and study it in an unblinking, rigorous fashion, we are surely destined to repeat it. Frederick Tayler is a very well-respected historian and this book will be a landmark in the post-Cold War rediscovery of 20th century history. I only hope the publishers are planning a German version, to bring the new research across the language barrier."
1,Wish I could,"I wish I could review Dresden, a book I ordered Nov 10, 2008. However, It is December 13, 2008 and I haven't received the book. I had intended to read Dresden for a book club meeting December 12. I don't need the book anymore so keep it and send me my money back. When I contact the vendor I get linked to Amazon. The link on Amazon takes me back to the vendor. Great system unless your goal is customer service."
1,Just another apologist for Allied war crimes,"Don't waste your money or your time. Taylor expends a lot of energy attempting to justify the unjustifiable. He lamely attempts to paint the picture of Dresden as a strategic military target while totally overlooking the dire condition not only of German military capabilities but even of the country's elementary infrastructure. The title alone is an indictment of the book. What incredible arrogance on the part of this apologist for Allied war crimes. He would have us believe that on Tuesday, February 13, 1945 Dresden was a serious military threat that required the most barbaric incendiary bombing ever carried out. Quite frankly, anyone who has studied the condition of Germany in 1945 would not be foolish enough to accept the author's premise. If you are interested in reading a worthwhile book on the issue consult The Fire: The Bombing of Germany, 1940-1945 by Jörg Friedrich:The Fire: The Bombing of Germany, 1940-1945."
4,did we all read the same book?,"I found this first and foremost a page turner, which is a blessing with any work of history. I found the author laid out the facts in a very compelling manner, and most often left the moral judgements to the reader. Of course it was mass murder, but in the context of that awful war the lines of moral right and wrong often seem very blurred. The Allies HAD to win, the war wasn't yet over. It's a very clear decision in hind-sight, based on the death toll, that it shouldn't have happened, but, at the time..."
2,Printing?,"The printing of the book is a complete disaster. It is full of errors i/e misspellings, incomplete words or sentences that makes difficult understanding the meaning of the narration. The book was edited in Barcelona, Spain which makes those errors unacceptable. It is sad because it is a Great story."
1,Misleading,"Look inside this book at a bookstore before you buy it. It is NOT about cabins but about huge lodges-log mansions, if you will."
5,Beautiful photography of the ultimate cabins,"Wonderful photography, well written chapters, and many, many decorating ideas. My wife and I really enjoyed this book. We decorate our home in a rustic style, and hope to have our own cabin in the Blue Ridge Mountains one day. However, a better title for this book might have been ""Cabins of the Rich and Famous""; these aren't the little cabins your grandparent's owned, or those that most people could afford.It is a great coffee table book if this is your area of interest, and will inspire you with building, design, and decorating ideas."
4,Mega Cabins,"A beautifully executed book. The ""cabins"" this book concerns itself with are, by and large, mountain-mansions of the ultra wealthy. The residence shown in this book are ""cabins"" in as much as the glided summer homes of Newport, Rhode Island are ""cottages.""The value of the book, beyond a record of truly beautiful design and execution of ideas when given an unlimited budget, is, as with most architectural endeavors, to take away some inspiration reduce it's scale and apply it to more modest undertakings."
1,book cover came bent and ripped,The book was delived quickly so thank you...I was in shock at the book cover however...the front cover was bent and the cover is also ripped. The product should have been labeled very very used and in poor condition!!!
5,Best travel tumbler available,"I bought one of these about 5 years ago. I used it every single day to take my coffee on the go to work. It has held up beautifully. It has an easy close lid that seals leak proof. You can drink from any side. and I like that it has no handle to get in the way yet, with the loop and Carabiner, I can hook it to my travel bag or belt. Though mine is still working just fine, it's a little banged up. So I searched and searched until I found it and ordered a new one today. I highly recommend this to anyone who, like me, needs a leak proof and durable travel mug."
3,Not really a fair rate because it came dented,"This product came dented so we returned it right away. However, we ordered the Thermos travel tumbler at the same time and liked it so much that instead of reordering this one we ordered another Thermos instead. We just liked the design and ease of the Thermos more."
4,Pretty good,"I would give it a 5 if the carabineer it comes with weren't so cheap and flimsy. The mug itself is great, doesn't spill, keeps coffee warm for a few hours."
4,Its Kirby. What else is there to say?,"Quite a lot actually. This is probably the least well known of Kirby's Fourth World. Still very good stuff. I liked the whole Fourth World saga except for the first half of Mister Miracle. Good story, good art. Its a wonder he managed to write and draw so much so fast without a noticable dip in quality. The stories are very plot-driven, not as much character development as some of his other work, but what plots! And of course, many new Kirby characters are introduced. A must have for any Kirby fan!"
5,Rediscovering Maria,"What a joy to listen to Maria Muldaur again after her warner bros. commercial days. I always thought she would ripen with time and she really has. The voice might be a little rougher around the edges but it is still classic Maria. My personal favorite so far is ""I wanna be loved."" I can hardly wait to catch up on more of her recent recordings"
5,Wonderful and uplifting!,This is truly one of the best CDs I have bought. Almost all of the songs are lively and uplifting. I would encourage anyone interested in spiritual music to purchase his album.
4,Great case for the price,"It would have been perfect with some anti-vibration features, but otherwise the case is very solid and easy to work with. The 11 bays make it easy to do anything, I have 3 burners, 3 SATA drives in RAID Hot Swap bays, and a Sound Blaster X-Fi Platinum and still have room for a 120mm fan in the front, its huge. Very impressed."
5,One of the Best!,This is an excellent book! Not only interesting but informative. I would like to inform you in case you didn't see it in the reveiw this EXACT book is also called Gone Fishin' ISBN 4770016565. So the people charging double what its worth are ripping you off.
3,The instructional equivalent of a beach book,"Rubin has produced a fun treatise on some Japanese grammatical structures. Nonetheless, it will likely contain few surprises for the more advanced student and it is not very useful as a reference. It's also very easy to blow through in a couple hours and you're unlikely to read it again. For a reference, the Dictionary of Japanese grammar series is superior. For fun, light reading, however, this book is hard to beat; not too many grammatical treatises can easily be read cover-to-cover."
5,We don't get it pretty often.,"""Making Sense of Japanese"" is one of those books we come accross, and it turns to be amazing. Any std of Japanese will profit from this material. He discusses issues that are quite important, and the way he presents them tops. It's truly a good purchase."
3,Making Sense of Japanese,"This book had many interesting and useful information, however, as for ease of use, I found it to be too chaotic. It may help to put it into another format."
2,Not so good,The book covers only basic grammar;quite boring; doesn't make much sense. I would not recommand this book.
1,Total disappointment.,"I bought this product in person at Hustler of Hollywood. I should have known better because the product was marked half off! The sales people had to test three of these before they found one that worked. I couldn't figure out how to assemble this once I brought it home. It sucked on my ""special area"" for all of five seconds before it fell off again. The vibrations were so tame. I eventually popped the egg out of bee to finish off. The bee tore and the black paint peeled off the body as I removed the egg. The egg was so hot and it took forever for me to climax. This was just a crap product. I can't return it because it's been used."
4,Great scale!,"I purchased this scale about a month ago and it meets all expectations. It is also VERY accurate (sadly as I need to lose weight!).I would give it a 5 star except that it's a little odd in its turning on. Other than that, and it's a nit, great product and worth the money."
1,Don't Buy this product...,I purchased this in order to keep track of my weight loss goals.I have 2 problems with the scale:1- The rubber feet fell off after about 3 days. Very poor design.2- The scale is very innaccurate. I am not talking a pound or two off. One day I would lose 10 lbs and the the next day I would gain 15.Very cheap design and very poor accuracy.This product is not worth the headache.
4,Talking Scale Says All the Right Things,"The scale arrived promptly (2 days), packed securely. Set up was a breeze. The scale works properly and the volume can be heard without difficulty. Accuracy is within.2 of a lb, as compared to more elaborate professional health agency's scale, which it replaced.It looks stylish and is small enough not to be in the way; but large enough to be sturdy and secure to stand on.All-in-all this is an excellent value and a good purchase for anyone who is having trouble seeing an ordinary scale."
1,Invisable Bath Scale,"I would love to review this product, but after all this time they still have not shipped it to me. It's not nice to advertise a product that seems to not exist."
1,Doesn't TALK,"The entire reason we purchased this product was so that my father could hear his weight. We are both IT professionals so we know how to work it. We have tried everything to get it to work but will not talk. Takes weight find but does not talk. Ughhh. Sending back and will reorder and hope second one actually does what states. If not, then we move on to another brand."
4,For my dad,Bought this for my father who has recently needed to start monitoring his weight. He had trouble viewing most scales and this one allows him to track his weight reliably.
4,Christmas gift,"I gave this talking scale as a Christmas gift, the recipient was very happy with it.The only improvement that I could make is an adjustable volume for ""talking"" part."
2,voice,The language on the talking scale is obviously Chinese. I do not like the sound or enunciation. It is also very cheaply made and feels that way when you step on the scale
4,Talking Scale,"Bought one for my 96 year old blind friend. Have had it one month so far. She loves it. Steps up, it says ""hello,"" steps off, it says ""ready"" then she steps up again and it says her weight. Voice is a little hard to understand, computerized, but the loudness is enough. That is my only complaint, voice clarity could be better. So she doesn't always understand what it says."
4,Scale accuracy,This is my second pair of scales from this company. The first pair matched the Weigh Watchers scales and two physcians scales. This new pair weighs a pound heavier than the first. I love the talking feature.
5,Great scale,"We like this scale. It's accurate, dependable, and the talking part is great because it just makes it easier."
3,don't see this on an empty stomach,"Character actor Hector Elizondo heads this story about a Hispanic family of four (widowed father and his three grown daughters) and the troubles of daily life that causes them to grow apart and then ties them together in the end. Elizondo's character is a master chef worried that he has lost his touch after the death of his wife and, as such, much of the movie revolves around him cooking. The scenery is great and the visions of the food are wonderful. The movie does drag at times but is definitely watchable (if you aren't already hungry you will be before it is over."
4,I'm hungry,"The *only* reason why I won't give this movie 5 stars is because I've seen Eat, Drink, Man, Woman (the movie on which this one is based) - and the plot is the same. But the food. Oh the food. As I suspected, the movie made my born-in-East-LA husband a little homesick. I hope they come out with a cook book - I would love to try some of those recipes in real life. Maybe it would ease my hubby's hankerings for his family's cooking."
3,"Good, but the original's better","Tortilla Soup is a satisfying movie, both in story line and mouth-watering food. However, I must admit that I prefer the original movie, Ang Lee's ""Eat Drink Man Woman"". If you don't mind subtitles and you liked Tortilla Soup, check this movie out as well."
4,Gentle movie especially for foodies,"This movie is about love and passion on many levels. Solid values, humorous and mouth watering. The type of feel good movie that you enjoy watching over and over again."
3,"Middling remake of Ang Lee's ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman""","""Tortilla Soup"" is a passable film, though it's exceptionally predictible, and far from original. Last year's ""What's Cooking?"" was a better, and even more ethnically diverse, food obsessed family drama. Some performers, especially Elizabeth Pena and Racquel Welch, do good work here, but the material is rather light. The film does manage to stand as one of the few American films that manages not to rely on violence to further its plot. I would reccomend ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"" or ""What's Cooking"" before this film though, as those films are better and feature better food photography (this film's shot on digital video & looks somewhat washed out)."
2,Watch the Original,"An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful ""Eat Drink Man Woman"". Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman."
4,FEEL GOOD MOVIE,I love love love Hector Elizondo! and the cast of this movie was great! This is a feel good home cooking family chick flick!! LOVED IT!!
5,Makes you want to watch from the kitchen.,"Sometimes a movie comes along that you just fall in love with. This is such a movie for me. The food preparations caught my attention being a huge foodie. The storyline caught my heart. Touching, romantic, funny, lighthearted but satisfying fare. I have to watch it every time it comes on tv as well as owning the dvd. A real feel good movie."
3,"A Direct Copy of Director Ang Lee's ""Eat Drink Man Woman.""","I liked the movie, but only because its original framework created by director Ang Lee. If you want to see a better (and original) version of this movie, see ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" by Ang Lee."
3,"OK, but could have been better","Eat Drink Man Woman is one of my favorite films and I looked forward to watching this Americanized remake of it with great anticipation. However, despite a strong cast and a lot of potential, this film simply doesn't live up to Ang Lee's excellent work. I doubt that it will have the appeal with foreign audiences that EDMW was able to garner (here in the US) by transcending the cultural framwork in which it was based."
1,Is originality really so scarce in Hollywood?,"I saw this movie earlier this year. It struck me as simply a Latino version of ""Eat Drink Man Woman"". While immitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, it's really painful to watch. The story itself is fine, but the straight copying is nauseating. Why???"
1,Bad on so many levels!,"I have only walked out on a movie twice in my life, and this was one of them. The other was Taxi Driver, which, at that time in my life, was just too violent to stomach. This was just to sickening to stomach. Filled with bad acting, trite dialog, two-dimensional characters, and sometimes-amateurish cinematography and film editing. Examples: A kitchen quarrel amongst the sisters is resolved by playfully breaking dishes on the floor and the three singing and dancing over the shards arm in arm. Just too cute. A character demonstrates her zest for life by standing up in a sports car with the wind blowing in her hair and squealing, ""Woo-hoo-o-o-o-o!"" Just too trite. And not only did I walk out after 50 minutes, but it was my wife (a ""chick-flick"" aficionado) who suggested we get out of the theater before she became physically ill from this turkey grande."
2,OK for a rip-off,"Go see ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" for a better version of the story. But it's kind of like dancing to a tacky cover-band at a wedding and enjoying it. No masterpiece, but no harm done. It made me hungry, though."
3,Yummy!,"Yes, Ang Lee's classic inspired it. So what. Sure, may be it lacks the panache of its precursor. All said and done, Tortilla Soup is still a fabulous feast of cooking, food, love, values.Set in some Mexican part of LA, this is a movie about, of course, food. But just bubbling under the comic surface are half a dozen more sombre themes involving how food brings us together and how it changes in tune with culture, sibling rivalry, personal freedom, ambition etc etc.Yet, the execution is thankfully sunny and quick so it never gets ho-hum. If nothing else, I bet it'll make you crave for some Mexican food. Highly recommend taking a sip of this one."
3,"Good film, but the original is far better","I watched this on TV. It was a good film with some very fine actors. Unfortunately, I found the original ""Eat Drink Man Woman"", upon which ""Tortilla Soup"" is based, to be far more interesting, as well as tantalizing to the taste buds."
2,Straight Rip Off,"As a Mexican-American woman living in the United States, I am glad to see Latins finally being represented on the big screen in a positive way. But the really depressing thing about this movie was the complete rip of of Ang Lee's (brilliant filmaker)masterpiece Eat Drink Man Woman. Come on! Can't we do better than that?"
3,I had already seen it,"This film is the same one than the 1994's Chinese film ""Eat Drink Man Woman"", the only difference being that this one takes place in Mexico."
5,Memory,"For the price I can't beat it, I got two GB of Raam for only 14.50 for the pair. Thank You!!! What a great deal!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Outstanding,Gene Witiak has been my personal veterinarian for 36 years. He is very fine man. I was thrilled when I heard he was writing a book. The book is full of stories both happy and sad about his lifes work of over forty years. The book also has many funny moments. Anyone who has every owned a pet or is an animal lover should read this book.
5,True Confessions of a Veterinarian,"Perfect book for our vet ~ a very loving story and hopefully something he will enjoy! As title says, ""an unconditional love story"" and it is!"
2,Second disappointment in a row...,"I hated Michael's last CD (not the right style for him, and the music overpowered his voice), and now this 2-CD set has disappointed me for other reasons: there is such a sameness from one song to another that I got very bored very fast. I've given both CDs a listen all the way through -- twice -- hoping the second time around I'd find something I'd missed the first time through. Nope. There's an exception or two, perhaps, but for the most part everything sounded the same. I miss the way his albums used to have a variety of tempos and serious/lighthearted songs next to each other. I'm going to give this set away or trade it in at the used CD store, and won't miss it for a minute. But I do miss the money I paid for it."
3,Save Your Money,"Mr. Feinstein used to delight us with his renditions of the music he loved. Alas, he's found a new love - his own voice. The lyrics are way too slow, the album is over orchestrated, and the 14 ""featured"" presentations serve as a further distraction. It's the auditory equivalent of watching someone viewing themselves in a mirror."
1,"He ca nsing, but he doesn't seem to have a style","Before you get all worked up, let me say that he has a voice, but he really doesn't have a style. he sings songs way too straight, he makes even Bobby Short sound like an improviser! He also doesn't seem to be in touch with his masculine side, his vocie is very, well if ying is male, and yang is female, he sounds very yang. He needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious, then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying(masculine side) in his voice. He needs to hear a few Billy Eckstine lp's. I don't think he can change but here's hoping he'll take my advice. As far as you buying this cd it is your decision, this is just my honest opinion."
2,Disappointing purchase for me!,"I like Mr. Feinstein, but this double CD is just boring. There is just piano and a couple of other instruments here and there.The songs are nostalgic and lovely, but each one sounds too much like the others. They need arrangements that would make these gorgeous songs memorable and not so dull. It is truly the first CD purchase I have made that is a disappointment."
4,*Film*--Wonderful; *Broadway*--Mediocre,"This 2-cd set is well-worth buying, if only for the first cd, *Romance on Film."" With songs like, ""Isn't it Romantic,"" ""The Way You Look Tonight,"" and ""All the Way,"" this album is a perfect romantic mood setter. Recorded live at Feinstein's, Michael's club at the Regency Hotel in NYC, it boasts an intimate feeling and puts the listener right at the front table. The second cd, ""Romance on Broadway,"" contains some really great numbers like ""As Long As She Needs Me"" and ""The Song is You,"" but it lacks the flow and vibe that emits from the previous disc. The double set, however, is still a great buy and a really sexy, romantic listen."
5,Feinstein Does It Again!,What can I say! Michael has once again done an amazing job. His new double CD is one of his best yet! Right from his choice of songs to the absolutely perfect singing! He is the best and I highly recommend this CD to everyone who enjoys romantic music. Let's face it no one can sing them like Michael Feinstein.
3,Not the greatest but ok,"I forgot how old this game was. I had built a computer and installed Windows 7. The game played ok, just an old game."
4,"somewhat silly, but still very enjoyable","I am very occasional reader of comics, but I thought this onewas quite entertaining. The series was recommended in a recentNYT article, so I decided to take a look. The art does not compareto the French greats like Moebius, but it fits the story. My understandingis that this is not representative of the other entries in the series,but I'd still recommend it."
1,Looked cute but not worth it very.,"Almost impossible to even move around. Most the time your facing one way the focus is off to your other side. You have to manually swing the camera view to see where your going. Very annoying when running through a twisting and turning alley and you never can actually see where your going without continually changing cam views at every step.Also basic movement is very clunky. Within minutes of starting the game you are suppose to jump from roof-to-roof of various buildings. But very difficult to straigthen out the character, he always wants to have a slight angle which then has you miss the jump to the next building.Played for about fifteen minutes. Enjoyed about 2 mins of that..."
5,Great Accessory and Functional for a 3 year old!,"Love the backpack on display. I also liked all other designs, from animals to flowers. The product is cute without being too girly. Love it!"
3,Wrong Backpack,"I received the wrong backpack.. It was an owl but, different style and color. Since the backpacks were birthday presents and time sensitive I don't have time to return it for the correct one. The back pack I ordered was the turquoise one above and I received a brown one with an owl in a tree. I'm very disappointed."
4,Good for toddlers,This is a nice lightweight backpack for a small toddler. My 13 month old daughter also has a skip hop backpack but it is too large and the straps fall off the shoulders. The backpack has a few loose threads but that shouldn't be an issue once clipped. The only negative is that the drawstrings are very long and hang about 7 inches below the bottom of the backpack when fully cinched.
4,Backpack,"I bought this backpack because I had purchased backpacks from Stephen Joseph in the past and the children LOVED their backpacks. It is fun and cute and very durable for a toddler (little items like dolls, hair accessories etc). One issue I have is the string that is used to tie the backpack close. It is very long (too long in fact) and the knots at the ends untie. I have to double tie the string to make sure that it isn't being dragged on the floor. The string is easily pulled out when the knots are undone and makes for an annoying situation when your toddler is screaming frantically because the bag ""broke"". I suppose she will grow to understand that she shouldn't pull out the strings, but until then I will have to continue tying knots."
5,Love it!,"I bought this bag for my little girl. I was looking for something to hold a few diapers when we go out, and something she could take with her when spending the night with grandma. This bag is perfect for that, and she loves wearing it. This bag is works for what we are using it for, but if you are looking for something for a school backpack, I don't think this will be it. It is kinda small for that."
4,Beautiful Gift,Purchased for a baby shower gift that was owl themed (baby's room was too). Arrived fast and really is a wonderful size that Tilly will be able to use as a toddler or her parents as a little take-along. Overall I really liked so I rated 4 stars as I'm not sure of durability.
3,Missing keychain,Tried to email them about the keychain looks like all items sold come with one on side and that's acutally one reason I picked this one for my daughter. It says wild child w/ the zoo type animals. But didn't get it?
1,NOT 100% COTTON!,This is NOT 100% cotton - the inside is all polyester lining. I don't know how they can get away with this false advertising!
3,"Adorable, but...","I really like the style of the bag, but it's much smaller then I thought, my daughters folder cannot fit in there without smashing it in. I would say the perfect age group for this is. Under pre k."
5,So cute,"Adorable, good quality, great colors. I got this as a gift for my niece and she loves it as a slumber party backpack."
2,"Good photos, lousy book","While Kim Taylor Reece is obviously a fine photographer, the book itself is lousy. While the cover is typical of both the quality & nature of the rest of the photos, the ones inside are - for the most part - just way too small. One would expect something more than mostly postcard-size pictures in a book 10"" x 11"". Too bad..."
1,Culture vulture,Don't mistake the beauty of the Hawaiian culture for a hack who does nothing but capitalize and rip off the very people he claims to venerate. This book is a waste of money. Anyone with a digital camera on vacation could capture these images. Kim Taylor Reece has no original ideas. He is a parasite of the Hawaiian people. Don't give him your money. Don't buy this book!
1,Amateurish and Repulsive,"I purchased this CD to see how effective Powerpoint is for this purpose. It does the job.However the material on the CD is just horrible. What parent would teach their child to talk about ""bugers""? The artwork is equally disgusting. No effort seems to have been put into it at all.I STRONGLY feel that the other reviews here are inauthentic. I purchased this product because of the other reviews. I feel that I have been cheated by this ""author""."
4,An Excellent Book for Open Minded People,"I read the book and I am looking forward to reading it More times. The author should have been more cautious to Christians feelings. Dr. Maurice who I understand was a christian, could have been less agressive. The Excellent example of the fresh & sea water being not mixed and the proof by Satellite pictures is an excellent example for people to realize that Islam is a devine religion. However, It should not have been as a comparison thus repulsing some people from being objective in their assesment of the Book."
1,Outdated and obsolete scholarshp thats no longer significant,"Bucaille has committed a grossly wonderful job of mis-representing, selective misinterpretations and scripture-twisting of the Bible. And Dr.William Campbell was doing nothing other than rightly representing the facts again, and correcting all those gross misinterpretations. I would say that it was Bucaille who has tried to lead many closed minds to become more shut. Whereas, Dr.Campbell has opened many of those closed minds with the clear light of truth again. Furthermore I also agree with the previous reviewer that theres a lot errors and mistakes in The Koran scientifically, historically and factually! One has just to study the few passages listed objectively, to get to know the truth! So much for the 'Word' of God! Really, this book should be in the 'Minus stars' category."
2,Fascinating!! for ones who read what they believe into facts,"Buccaille's book does have some true points (this is why I have not given 1 star) but how he manages not to see all the problems about the collection of Quran (that even very orthodox Moslem scholars saw) , how indeed the context radically influences it with terribly unscientific staff (demons trying to steal revelation from the edges of heavens and are thrown stars at), how many things, unless you twist, are not at all scientific (sperm from the belly, sun setting in a muddy place etc)are amazing examples of showing how human beings can see what they believe in ""facts"". How you read your mind into data!!!"
3,Name is somewhat misleading,"Package said Vermont American, but it turns out it is made in China. Perhaps they should be called Vermont Chinese. Anyways, average quality and decent but nothing special. I tested them and some are slightly wobbly, a common trait of average drills. Yes, low price but also average overall. Good for occasional users who need a hex drill bit here and there."
3,"Good Stuff, But None of it is Original","I liken this book to the movie ""THe Naked Gun- From the Files of Police Squad"". While all of the gags, and jokes in the movie were funny, they were all (80 to 90%) taken from the short lived TV series Police Squad.Same here with this book. All of the stuff is very informative and interesting, but it's really just a compilation of Knight stories from other books and articles. THere are a couple of new pieces (I have the Good Knight/Knightmares updated version)but not really enough for me to give it more than three stars.But in fairness, if I had never read the pieces from their original sources, I would have enjoyed it more and rated it higher.If you have the originals, bypass this book. I wasn't smart enough thoroughly peruse through it before I purchased it. Yes, I am kicking myself right now. Maybe the three stars is for me and not the book. But where would you ever see Bob Knight compared to THe Naked Gun?"
2,Uncomfortable,"These are very uncomfortable and, in my opinion, unusable. They look like they would fit snugly around the ear, but don't. The plastic covering the speakers comes into contact with the ear. Without a snug fit, they don't mute external sound at all, and when you move you constantly hear the sound of your ear rubbing against the plastic speaker covers."
1,Look elsewhere,Got constant static and a screeching noise in the background when i listened to everything. had to return them. Didn't have any charging issues though....
1,Doesn't work with Plasma TV's!,"I purchased this headset mainly for watching movies. To my surprise I got terrible static with it and then I saw on page 12 of the manual that plasma displays may interfere with normal operation. I was very disappointed, but Amazon agreed to take this item back for full credit instead of an 80% credit since it was opened."
1,Rick Seneris,This headphone is just good to listen to tv or radio. The sound is not for serious music listening. It is actually mediocare as far as fidelity is concern but I am not very disappointed because I bought it for my wife to use watching tv at night. I just can't stand listening to soap operas she watches.
1,Very poor,"I was never able to get enough volume from this unit (AR AW722/AW772) for easy listening. To make it work the volume on the TV was set so high that I no longer needed the headset. Product is being returned.A second unit I bought for my son-in-law worked for about 10 months and then quit completely. Replaced by Best Buy with a Sony headset.My original purchase of an AR, AW771, was bought several years ago from Best Buy. It works fine. I am told by AR that this unit was replaced by the AW722/AW772. Obviously not a good replacement. Perhaps the only thing improved was their profit margin."
2,"If you're even a slight audiophile, don't buy this.","These AW722 headphones are sound about as good as cheap boom box. There's hardly any bass, not much depth, and only so so clarity. If all you do is listen to the TV and aren't too picky about sound, these are probably good enough for you. But if you're interested in listening music with a rich overall sound, get something else. I listened to my friend's AW771 with the 40mm drivers and they were pretty good for being wireless. I'll see if I can find a set of those."
1,Don't buy this product!,"I've already returned one to Amazon, and I'm getting ready to return the replacement unit they shipped me. The product sounds fine when it works, but the rechargeable batteries, after a couple of days of very light use, just stops charging. The idea of a wireless rechargeable headphone is great in theory, but I guess just not in practice."
4,Wireless Stereo Headphones,The headphones seem to be very nice with the exception of the volume control is a little sticky but no big deal. They have very good sound quality and allow me to go all around my house and still get recption.I like the self charging cradle-I makes it so easy to keep the batterys charged and ready for use.
2,"Could be Great, but...","These would be awesome if the power supply would stay on! We have to send them back, but are willing to give them one more try..."
4,these headphones are great!,"this is my first wireless head set and i must say I am very please with them!the charge stand doesn't seem to work right so I just pop the battery's into a battery charger I had and that works fine,just keep a pair of regular batteries around for when you need to charge them or charge them when your sleeping..I have my headset plugged into my home sound system so I can turn off the speakers and just use the head phone jack,by turning up the stereo it makes the signal to the head set way way stronger.I can walk all around the house ( and not miss a thing if I have to go to the rest room in the middle of a show;)they are good at keeping other noise out ( I use them when Im on the treadmill)or if my wife is asleep and Im still up, playing video games.. lolyou can even turn them down soft and not loose sound qualityand they have a really good quality construction, two thumbs up for me!"
2,I hate these things...,"The only good thing about these is they are comfortable, but that doesn't matter if they never transmit sound... Complete waste of money."
3,Review of the Acoustic Research Wireless Headsets,"The quality of the sound is very good and the distance you can be from the TV is excellent, however you need a clear path from the headphone base and the headset. Any slight blockage will reduce the quality of the sound noticably. The biggest problem is maintaining a charge on the headset. Once the headset is fully charged you must remove the headset immediately from the charging cradle and set it off to the side or it will decharge if left in the charging cradle for more than 8 hours."
5,Good to go,"Very good sound, very good price. Used in watching TV. Did not miss a beat. Good product."
5,acoustic research wireless headphones,Recieved headphones 3 day after I ordered them. Work great for watching tv and listening to the stereo. Very good range. Can walk around the house with them and signal is good.
1,Stops charging after a couple of months,I purchased two of these units and both stopped recharging after a couple of months. One I have sent to the manufacturer to be repaired or replaced and it has been over a month and I have heard nothing. I still have the other worthless set wondering what I am going to do with it.
4,they do the job smoothly,"I've had this for a month or so, have used it a bit.* they are comfortable on your head, though of course as you can see they have that ""full headphone"" look, no miniature/modern headset look here.* it is not some digital wireless technique, so there is a little knob that you sometimes adjust when you start listening to make sure that your signal is tuned in just as well as it can be. not a hassle, but one would prefer to have some perfect locked-in signal.* I've gone off into the next room (in 2 different directions) and the signal stays clear. just once a few days ago it did cut out in the other room -- that would then be time to touch that tuning knob because it obviously wasn't perfectly tuned.overall, good stuff. the charger cradle is cool, and when it's charging you don't have to plug anything in. just sit it in the right location and it charges the headset batteries by induction."
3,a good book,Squanto friend of the pilgrims is a really good book. It tells you about how Squanto got to learn the English language.It tells you how Squanto gets with the pilgrims.you should get this realy good book.
1,An overused and stereotypical piece of writing,"This book, although a resource used in many classrooms across the United States, has been overused. This book has an improper representation of the history of Squanto's life. Research has not been done at all in the development of this book.The way in which the author portrays Squanto is very poor as well. This book was written in 1954, a time in which the idea of what an Indian was supposed to be was stereotypical. Squanto is portrayed as unable to speak proper English even after 9 years in England. I would not recommend that this book be used in the classroom unless it is to address the stereotypical view of Indians. There are more recent publications that are much more suitable for reading.For a book with accurate historical information and reference items in the back of the book, see Joseph Bruchac's Squanto's Journey.If I could give a rating of zero, I would."
3,Interesting story about the Indians and the Englishmen.,I liked this book because it was a very interesting story about Squanto and his journeys with the English in the New World and in England. I found it sad the way he was put on display and mistreated by Captain Weymouth. In the end it was wonderful that he found a home in the New World with the pilgrims.
3,Squanto`s Journey!!!!!!!!,"This book is OK but people get hurt like when Squanto and some other men were captured and thrown into a dungeon.Then they were sold as slaves! When Squanto returned to his home his family was dead!!!! At first he didn`t know but then he went to a nearby tribe and asked ""where`s my family?"" the tribe said 'white men bring terrible disease everyone die!!!!!!!!"
3,A good book,Squanto is my favorite book. His whole village died.This made me sad. Squanto missed his family.He met the pilgrims. They became his new family.
1,it was so borring,because I thought it was going to be interesting but it was not that interestining.Also because it only talks about him and not the other people in the story.because it about this indian named squanto that he lived in this tribe and that one day the english explorers came and kidnapped him and brought different kind of diseases to his tribe.that when he got back all of his tribe was dead and months later the pilgrams came to his tribe they did'nt know how to survive so squanto help them so he should them different kinds of food for example they did'nt know about popcorn.And the reason why the pilgrams got their because they wanted tostar a new religion and that how Thanksgiving started.
5,Want To Be Truly Scared?,"Vulgarian Goulash is a book of short stories that are extremely well crafted and utterly unusual. While the sex and violence are hard-hitting, they are part and parcel of our daily life; what we cannot escape even though we do our best to deny such is the case.Vulgarian Goulash gives you a Lynchian ""Blue Velvet"" feel that lingers with you for days. But, this book is filled with incredible ideas; unlike any you've ever experienced; truly unique and worthy of a read. Do yourself a favor. Read VULGARIAN GOULASH today."
1,Can't rate it 0,"When you try to install this software, it launches a browser window to GoDaddy. There is supposed to be a place to enter an activation code, but there isn't. I emailed GoDaddy support and was informed they don't sell or support this software anymore. So, I returned it to Amazon."
3,Turn On the Sequal of the Sequal,"Do you remember the movie back in 1989, ""The Turn On,"" when a mad scientist uses a special remote control to turn on women? I'm sure some of you remember. After eleven years later another sequal came out called, ""The Ultimate Attraction.""""Sex, Lies, and Politics"" is the third installation of ""The Turn On."" This story involves money, power, seduction, and a man named ""Ron Slick"" who loves to use the remote control on beautiful women when they least expect it, such as Congress Woman during her conference, a sexy reporter during a newscast, and so on so on.I'll give it three stars for the effort. There are total of 6 installations of ""The Turn On."" Well, three down and three more to go. It took a long time for each movie to come out. By the time the last one becomes available, a decade will pass, and we'll all be ten years older."
3,Not quit what I had hoped for,"I keep my ice cream very cold and this scoop does not seem to cut through it ""like butter"". It would have been nice if the head could be removed from the rest of the scoop so sanitizing would be a bit easier."
3,Poor but better than nothing.,"If it hurts your hand to push hard into ice creme, like if you have arthritis, this will make it easier.But... it barely gets hot.It works about the same as heating up a metal ice cream scoop under the hot water spout in the sink. It does beat a plastic ice creme scoop heated up by hot water.Overall it is not up to the job it is made for.."
2,DISAPOINTED,"I had high hopes that my usual struggles with getting a good scoop of ice cream directly from the freezer would be helped. One plugs in the Deni Electric Ice Cream scoop and allows it to warm up for a minute or two. After the first two scoops it loses heat and becomes like any other non-electric scoop. Then, in order to continue, you would have to let it warm up again, which to me loses its value."
2,The Search for the Perfect Ice Cream Scoop Continues,This scoop sounded great. No more waiting for the ice cream to thaw. No more scoop mangled ice cream cartons. Unfortunately by the time the scoop was warm enough to do the job it was creating melted pools of ice cream in its wake.
3,too much...,This item was way bigger than I thought it was going to be and I was dissappointed to find out that you needed to plug it in. great idea for my dad who can't get enough ice cream but not very convenient.
1,Not suitable for use in the uk,"Purchased the product and it was shipped. I only found out that it is not suitable for use in the uk when it arrived. There was no warning to this fact on their advert and the fact they were shipping to the uk did not seem to bother them, they would rather just take the money for the sale than phone to tell me it is not suitable. Sadly for me I purchased four of them as well. Not very happy"
3,Cute but not durable,They're really great other than the cork part gets noticeably compressed as you walk in them. It looks sorta weird.
3,Creation - 'Psychedelic Rose' (Vivid Sound),"Mid-'80's reunion effort by two members of The Creation;guitarist Eddie Phillips and vocalist Kenny Pickett(R.I.P.).Maybe not the best of it's kind,but I thought it was okay.A decent later day release of the short-lived British late '60's psych band.Cuts I thought sort of stood out a bit were the title track ""Psychedelic Rose"",""Radio Beautiful""(possibly the CD's best tune),""Far From Paradise"" and ""White Knight"".Check out the sound clips that's provided on other sites.Enjoy!"
4,Thoughtstream portable biofeedback device,"Can be used stand-alone or interfaced to Proteus meditation stimulator to provide meditator with brain-state information to guage depth-of-state. Meditators attempt to achieve transition from normal Beta state to Alpha, Theta, and Delta states. Unless one is very experienced, it may be difficult to make an assessment as to how successful a session is. By measuring galvanometric skin condition via a surface-contact sensor, Thoughtstream provides a very sensitive measure. When interfaced witht the Mindplace Proteus stimulation unit, it actively controls the stimulation process to pursue deeper states of meditation. The company is soon releasing a new version that will interface with the Procyon stimulation unit."
3,deffinetly not their finest.,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Bratmobile. They are an inspiration to all the little riot grrl's, But this cd lacked a certain element that the other's had. If you're looking into Bratmobile and you aren't sure what cd to buy, I'd deffinetly start with ""pottymouth"". ""Real Janelle"" is a close second. If they turn out to be like your absolute favorite band, then I'd buy ""ladies, women, and girls"" , but whatever you do save it for last. I don't want it to change anyones opinion on these kick ass girls' talent."
