2,not worth buying,"this is book is not very good. It tells you vaguely some nursing concepts, but not enough to help explain 'difficult concepts' I wish i hadn't wasted my money on this book."
5,Every science library should have two copies of this book.,"This book is the best ever written about Van der Waals forces. Parsegian is the world's expert on this subject, which is essential for an understanding of physical biology and much of chemistry, engineering, and physics. Parsegian writes superbly and clearly. His book is fun to read. Every biologist and every biophysicist should get a copy. Every science library should have at least two copies of this book."
2,took forever,this item was the last to be received of 7 other books I'd ordered the same day. In fact it came almost 2 weeks later then any other and when I contacted the seller they were rather rude about it. I won't be buying from them again.
3,pictures would do good for the book,The book is good except that there are hardly any graphics to it. Pictures add a lot to motivating one to trying and choosing new recipes to make.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"The title of book itself is misleading. Several receipese require machines, such as the use of a blender. There is really no simple way for busy people to go raw without investing in equipment, time and money. This book is a joke and the receipes were horrible. Who needs a receipe for salad. Don't waste your money."
3,to many of the same things listed,It was ok and I will use some of the recipes - but it was mostly sauces and dressings
3,was sorry to see that we still need mahines,I am sorry to see that many of the recipies require machines.. I can deal with a blender and a food processor...but a dehydrator? come on..I thought this book was about NOT shelling out money for machines.
2,Disappointing,"The book is small, not pleasant to look at in any way, and I'm surprised that a number of the recipes call for tools and food items that are beyond the ""normal"" kitchen. I thought this was a basic book, good for someone interested in learning about incorporating raw foods into their diet. I haven't tried any recipes yet - only saw a few I'd likely actually try. I'll look through it more, but at this point I think it's a poor choice for an intro to raw foods."
3,Good information,"I am considering a raw diet and am looking for information on recipes that are fun but that do not require a bunch of silly gadgets. This book had some good ideas and because of it, I have gotten a few other books to gather more information."
3,"Ok...not great,",This book is not the best raw food book out there. It's kind of boring and lacks a lot of information. I recommend The Raw Food Detox Diet by Natalia Rose.
3,disappointed,I quickly skimmed thru this book and found that it did not offer anthying new. My expectations were that it had novel ideas about making raw meals that were tasty but I guess it was just too basic.
1,did not find this helpful,I own a good selection of veg books. For me this was not worth the purchase or reading time. I did read it cover to cover (thinking it will get better) but I just was very disappointed.
2,Unimpressive recipes,"I recently purchased this book along with ""Raw in Ten Minutes"" by Brian Au, both of which will be sent back to Amazon soon.The recipes in this book are indeed quick but then again so is grabbing an apple or banana when your on the go. These recipes are about a step up from that. The chapters include salads, dips, soups, sauces and deserts. Nothing super substantial, appetizing or unique.This is a very small book and while it's only 11.95 the price is still too high for what you get.I would reccomend ""Raw foods, Real World"". The recipes are inspired, delicous and require no more time than these, just preperation. And I honestly dont think throwing something in a dehydrator and then walking away is that hard."
5,This is doable!,"Finally, a raw food (un)cookbook I can use! I'm not much of a cook, or perhaps I should say food-preparer, but I can do these recipes. The ones I've tried so far are very good. They don't require extremely unusual ingredients (which I don't have access to here) or expensive machines. I give this book five stars."
2,Not so great,"This was an alright book, but I haven't found myself using it much.First of all, a lot of the recipes call for a dehydrator - wait, I thought this was machine-free?I much prefer ""Raw Food Made Easy"" - which is truly more machine-free (I bought a food processor for $40 - which you need for those recipes, but have so far held off on the $180 dehydrator) and, as said in the title, easy! I don't think you should bill yourself as machine-free when lots of your recipes require something as expensive as a dehydrator!I am giving this two stars - I haven't really tried the recipes, so I can't judge them - but the fact that I haven't says something considering I am making recipes every day from the book I mentioned above!"
1,Waste of money,"This cash box is poorly constructed and has not held up well at all. Although the general layout is nice - cash in the lid with spring clips, removable tray, it is just not meant to stand up to any sort of wear and tear. I use it as my cash box at various craft shows, so I take it to and from the show every morning and night one or two weekends a month. After only a couple of shows, it was not closing properly. It will sometimes get stuck closed and is difficult to open. Yet sometimes the combination lock does not work and it flies open and change will go everywhere! The very nature of a cash box is something to be toted around but this one seems like it was made to be stationery and not be used very much. I am very disappointed and after only 6 months of use, I already need to buy a new one!"
5,Convenience,"We use this at trade shows. Finding a good box that had space for several types of bills, coins, and checks was key. We are happy to continue using this box, and if we need more, I will purchase more of these boxes."
5,THe best rare nirvana CD,This CD has to be the best rare Nirvana CD ever made. The songs unheardof but it is a must buy cd.
4,Very Cute - great idea for 2 child families,"I just got this item but I paid considerably less than the current price - I only paid $[...]. I might have paid as much as $[...] but no more. It is a cute item & perfect for using to track two childrens' growth. The pockets are small but you can cut down a photo to fit nicely. It is really a clever idea to have the pictures displayed at the current height of the child & it works well. You get two little stuffed fabric mice that are attached with velcro; you write each child's name on the mouse tail & use it the mark the childs height & move it up as the child grows. It is well made & attractive, I would recommend this especially if you can get a lower price!"
5,Fantastic,20 toe tapping sing along songs. Elvis Costello what more is there say. No really all the great great tunes from a wide range of his albums. Enjoy!!
3,These are HUGE!,I was impressed with the style and quality but had to return them because they were so wide! There was no option to buy normal size. If you're a Sumo wrestler looking for a nice pair of glasses....
5,love them,"I bought this glasses, they are nice, good fit, nice view, etc etc. the only problem I had is that I did not get them when I was supposto get them, I contacted the dealer and it seem someone stole the glasses during the shipping, but the company was nice enought so send me another pair overnite.."
2,Assembled poorly-disappointed,We were really disappointed with these RayBan sunglasses. There was a space around the lens between the lenses and the frame. They were creaky/not solid as all of our other RayBan sunglasses have been in the past and the arms were loose. Made us question if they were real RayBans.
2,"Good simulation, poor basis, riddled with errors","This book was part of a graduate research class I was in. We built thier simulation from the ground up, but found many errors and simulation artifacts with in the book. Though the simulation was a very good one, they left or ignored key details, and the book only discusses the conceptual model. Building the model from the information in the book can be an exercise in futility. They do not give much detail, and what they do give, they hide within footnotes and seperate critical information with pages of analysis. The alanysis unfortunately doesn't talk about model deficiencies and other simulation artifacts the modelers introduced. In the end, an excellent simulation, regardless of how they put it together, and the errors their model injected into it."
4,Good intro to agent sims.,"Granted, this is not a cookbook for creating the simulations described. However, it gives a good picture of the power of agent simulations, and shows the basics of behavior modeling. In this respect, it is an excellent text. I would suggest it for an advanced undergrad course, rather than graduate level."
2,An enormous disappointment,"This book is an opportunity missed. The subject is interesting (and contrary to the views of another reviewer, I think there is valuable research being done here).The model seems to be well thought out, although its very limited scope (a 50 by 50 playing field) makes me almost sure the results can have little meaning. I was continuously troubled by the fact that they described their world as a torus (wrap-around like a doughnut) but none of the illustrations supported this. I didn't buy the version with the CD-ROM, but frankly, I'm glad I saved my money.Moreover, at almost every paragraph, I felt the authors had contrived the result they desired.For a much more stimulating read, try ""Turtles, Termites, and Traffic Jams : Explorations in Massively Parallel Microworlds"" by Mitchel Resnick,"
5,Pioneers of agent modeling,"This short book is written by the pioneers of the agent-based modeling technique. It describes their pioneering model, starting with the most basic iteration. Each chapter describes the process of adding a layer of complexity to the model, and the results therein. It contains no ""errors"" or ""artifacts."" It is a ""how to book,"" for those with at least a passing interest in social science and the ability to download shareware from the web (i.e. NetLogo). Any person with an interest in this field must be able to discuss this book, as well as the author's Anasazi model, among others."
2,Don't bother if you want to insert video or get support.,"I tried inserting short (each 40 seconds or less) .mov clips from my iPod touch into my timeline and the app ALWAYS crashes in preview mode at some point...not always on the first clip, but before finishing the project (total of six clips). When trying to export in ANY format at least one of the clips, if not all are just a black screen with audio in the background. I've e-mailed customer support and have been ignored. Don't bother with this product if you want to incorporate video clips or expect good customer support."
5,great book,I always wanted a book that taught you how to play like the endinburgh military tattoo then look no further than this its all you could ever want a compact well presented easy to read rudiments book fantastic
2,"The film is great, this video Version definitely is not","I was much looking forward to viewing this early film of Kieslowski. And I was very much enjoying the screening, till suddenly the video version ended ... 15 to 20 minutes before the conclusion of the actual film.In the video taping, somehow, and unfortunately, the final part of the film was cut off. Incomprehensible.Then to confirm my suspicion/conclusion, I screened the film again with a Polish colleague, and he pointed out that the English subtitles are very weak, that they do not conform very precisely with the dialogue, and that, in fact, much of the time, they are seriously out of synch with the spoken dialogue.All very unfortunate. Kieslowski and his fans deserve better."
3,Not what I expected....,"I was looking for some basic poems that my children and I could use to memorize some familiar old poems. This book was not what I expected. The poems are of an older style. While some poems are familiar like ""Georgie Porgie puddin' pie"" but others like ""Here are my ladys forks and knives"" was totally unfamiliar to me. I did enjoy the thick pages and illustrations, but wish I would have gone for Poems Old and New."
4,Loved It!,"I have all of New D's albums and I really liked this one too. This choir is defaintly on fire for the Lord and their enthusiasm, their energy has inspired me and my youth choir. But I do wish that there were more songs on this album, more new songs too. Rain defaintly had that. But nevertheless, this was a good CD."
2,What happened!,I was honestly dissapointed with this album. I bought this album with the expectation of the caliber of songs that was found on the album RAIN.This album is average. All I can do is sigh and hope the next album is better.
3,Good But Could be Better,"I got the cd the day it came out I'm a big New D fanand of thier sister choirs chicago mass joshua's troopPraise II choir etc. I was a tad dissapointed about itbut there are some good Hot songs. I hope the next cd is betterThe get your praise on cd is the best cd. if you got the new release and you did not like it or you have never heard of themget the get your priase on cd, and the Rain cd. They stillHave the New D flavor on the new cd. It's just i think they rushed in to it. Still get it though. there are some really good songs. The get your praise on cd i liked every song on it.It's is Da Bomb.Also I recommend you Getting,cd's of there sister choir cd's Excellent"
3,Mathematically precise and somewhat automatic,"I've had this recording in my early music collection for about five years now. Despite my collection's small size, I find myself consistently skipping this one. The voices are precise, clearly articulated, and sonorous, and the recording quality matches. But to me, the performance comes across as mathematical and a bit hurried, as if they didn't know what the words meant and had practiced for so long it had become automatic. ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon"" introduced me to the Cambridge Singers long ago and I was sorry not to feel the same depth of interpretation here."
1,A Re-packaging of John's Wild Life Concert. A big rip off !!!,"I received this item as a Christmas gift and was shocked and disappointed to realize that I already had this DVD, but with a different title. This is just a very very poor copy of John's Wild Life concert. Which of course I already have. I feel very strongly that I (and I'm sure many others) have been ripped off. My only comment is ""How was this allowed to take place"" and ""who, if anyone, can be held liable"" If this isn't fraud, I'm not sure what you would call it. I spoke to a customer service rep. at Amazon.com and was told that it was sold thru Amazon, by Immortal. They take no responsibility for this!!! I'll definately be more cautious that next time I purchase anything from Amazon.com !!!!"
1,Absolute Beginers book,"i have purshased this book after i have read ""all about hedge funds"" which is extremely advanced and useful book, ""all about commodities"" is very helpful and covering a lot of issues regarding the topic, however, its for beginers only if you have a single idea about commodities, futures & options, then this book is not for you"
5,A STUNNING 7TH !!!!,"This is the most electrifying performance of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony I have ever heard!! It has much more spontanity and drive than Kleiber's studio recording with the VPO and it is even more exciting than his concertegebouw performance from 1984 (DVD only).Indeed, this is really one of those rare performances that convince you from start to finish that this music cannot be heard more vivid, dramatic and true,and it can only happen with a genius conductor like Carlos Kleiber.This great evening was captured in a very fine recording andIt belongs to the short list of the greatest Beethoven recordings of all time!"
5,The best Seventh since the last fifty years!,"Carlos Kleiber gave a strong, fierce, tense and impressive reading of Beethoven's Op. 92, overpassing even, his memorable Seventh with the Vienna Phliharmonic.Inspired with Promethean vigor and febrile intensity. Listening it you will include it among the greatest Sevenths of all time together with Furtwangler's 43, and Toscanini's 38.It's such the level of its interpretive greatness. Don't miss this extraordinary performance by any circumstance."
5,Concise and meaningful,Great gift idea for almost anyone. I've been using it for that for many years. Best for Teens up to any age.
4,Very good book and very emotional,"This book had you feeling every emotion while reading it. I rarely cry while reading books but this book had me in tears through the entire book, I was also cheering because of certain action done by members of the services, the kennedy team and of the family itself. I was very skeptical about reading this book sense it got alot of heat before being published but I think the end result was done very well. I would recommend this book to any one who is/was a fan of JFK, the Kennedy's in a whole or just anyone who wasn't born yet(like me) who might want to get a real glimpse of what are parents and the rest of the world went through at that time. Definitely adding this to my collection."
4,Still the definitive work on the Kennedy assassination and it's aftermath...,"However, given the large number of positive reviews here, most of which I agree with, it's worth noting that this book was published around the time there was considerable dissatisfaction and questions being raised about the findings of the Warren Commission and that Manchester I feel, truly gives short shrift to Lyndon Johnson and the transition that took place. To suggest that this was an easy time for Johnson or that there was some desire on the part of the Vice-President to usurp power without regard to the feelings of the Kennedy family or Bobby Kennedy in particular is utter nonsense. Upon reading this material I suggest people also give Max Holland's 'The Kennedy Assassination Tapes' a read as well. Holland's compilation of the taped discussions between Johnson and others in the days and years after Nov. 22 tell a very different story than what Manchester would have us believe."
5,The Death of a President,"I appreciate that you not only had it available but in good order and it arrived rather quickly. Thanks a lot, mjl"
4,The Death of a President,"The book arrived quickly and I do appreciate having it. It will go into my Kennedy collection which started 11/22/63. I was amazed it was available, especially after the Vanity Fair article."
4,Very good resource,This is a great book and seems to be very comprehensive in it's considerations for you to think about as you approach parenting. I think it was a good investment!
1,Dreadful - save your time and money,"OK, so it's dark. It's also slow, gory, perverse, and dull. Forget loving the characters, can't they be interesting? And participate in a story line? Be strongly cautioned if you have trouble with torture, sadism, and child abuse. I don't call that ""sensual."" My stronger-stomached friends didn't believe how much I disliked this, and tried it themselves. Now they agree -- there are better things to read. I'll be turning my copy in to the second-hand store."
2,Overwhelmingly dull fantasy.,"Bishop populates her world with uninteresting, interchangeable characters (with contrived names like Saetan, Lucivar, and Daemon), and treads water with them for the first three quarters of the book. By the time anything interesting does happen - in about the last 100 pages - it is certainly not worth the wait. Even more frustrating is her habit of alluding to things the characters know well, but never explains to the reader. I lost count of the number of passages that left me wondering what had just happened after I'd read them, and felt like I was reading a later volume rather than the first of a new trilogy."
1,Terrible,Characters who are unlikeable.Perversion as virtue.No action.Repetitious self torment as a substitute for character development.I tried. I really did. Especially considering the rave reviews on Amazon. But I couldn't stick it out past about 2/3 of the book.
1,Read the first two books....,"I don't know why I even read book two and started three. The ""romance"" I know was finally going to happen (I think) in book three but by then I did not care - I was bored. These books went a bit overboard on the child rape subplots --- I could bear it in book one but then it came back in book two and so on. Also all the side characters were just wretched people. And book two was just boring compared to book one and book one just left you hanging. Spend your $ elsewhere."
5,Truly a favorite,"_Daughter of the Blood_ is the first book in the best dark fantasy trilogy I have ever read. It's the story of Jaenelle, who is Witch(a fulfilment of a prophecy made hundreds of years before), Daemon(one of the most lusciously dark *heroes* I've ever encountered), and Saetan(who happens to be the wonderful father figure to Jaenelle). This book is so passionate and magical and fascinating that I read it over and over again while waiting impatiently for the second book. Very highly recommended to any lover of strong-yet-wounded heroines, strong-yet-wounded heroes, and any lover of fantasy."
3,Interesting but derivative,"I read the Black Jewels trilogy a decade ago and liked it pretty well, but having gone through it again recently I think I'm a lot more critical. The universe is pretty interesting and the author writes very sensually, but a lot of the story's elements are pretty silly. The names in particular I could do without (I know she is drawing from mythology, but still...) and the actual ""main character"" girl is really overdone with description/abilities whatever. Kind of a Mary Sue.That said, the series is actually pretty decent if you can get past that stuff, and some of her characters are really cool."
5,I recommend,"For all those fantasy lovers, this is a must read. Very well develop characters and a fantastic story and magic installment, I started reading it because I wanted something a little more mature, not the typical teen fantasy and I wasn't dessapointed."
3,Not a read for children,"This is not a book I would want my kids to read. I enjoy many types of books fiction/supernatural/true crimes, etc. I do not believe books should be senored, BUT, there is far too much sex, and not the normal stuff either. Books of this type should have a notice to parents. This book was purchased by my 12 year old daughter for a book report a school. Playboy would have been a cleaner read.... She has a new book. Now I have read this book and enjoyed it - A slow start, written in the style of ""Dune"". But with time and pages the story unfolds nicely."
3,nice book,"though i enjoyed reading this book, i think i would rather read about Daemon than about Jaenelle. personally, though, i still prefer Anne Rice to Anne Bishop. (read Interview with the Vampire if you don't believe me, you'll get hooked)"
4,Wonderful after the first 140 pages,"The first third of the book plods on and on as Bishop does a brain dump on every little detail she can think of to describe her world, which is interesting - but not that interesting. Something kept me going and after clearing that hurdle I was caught up in an original story with characters that I finely came to care about since their storylines were no longer being interuppted every other paragraph with yet more info on the dark jeweled society. Some will no doubt be offended by having Saetan Lord of Hell as one of the heros and the growing romance between a 700 year man and a 12 year girl. The one thing that bugged me about the book was that there were all of these characters that were hundreds and thousands of years old and yet they still seemed to react to life as if they were in their 30's. You would think they would be rather bored by now and perhaps be just the tiniest bit wiser. But no matter, I am looking forward to the next installment."
4,A departure from the norm...,"This book is wonderful! This was Ms. Bishop's first novel, and I must say that it took my breath away. I was entranced at the depth of the characters, and at the characters themselves. Jaenelle is so fragile, it just breaks your heart to see what she has gone through in her life. Sadi has this hard exterior, but underneath is caring.I guess I can't say enough good things about this book. But be warned, you can't be faint of heart to read this--somethings are handled very brutally.Off to read book 2!"
4,Excellent!,"This book took me a long time to read because it was hard for me to get interested at first (hence the 4 stars). However, I found that this is one of those books where if you can get through the first half, it turns into a true gem! Once I got through the first half of the book I could not put it down. I finished it this weekend and am already 300 pages into the second book, which just keeps getting better! I recommend this series. It is very hard to stop reading and to get anything else done."
2,Fantasy Soap Opera,"Most of the books I buy based on other readers recommendations usually turn out to be ok but every now & then I kick myself for wasting my money. This book is one of those few.I could not finish this book. Half way through, it just got too boring and was going nowhere very slowly. The plot definitely had potential (dark and sombre) but it just wasn't interesting enough to keep me reading. The characters did a lot of chin wagging & chit-chatting and very little else. But, based on the large number of glowing reviews for this book, I am obviously one of a small minority who did not like this book so if the storyline tickles your fancy, odds are you will enjoy reading this book."
2,Dark Dreams,"I read fantasy to escape the harsh realities of our world, but Anne Bishop has created a fantasy that dwells in the most nightmarish of harsh realities. Central to the story are the repeated themes of the abuse, molestation, incest and torture of children. There was no escaping these vignettes, as they are central to the story and the characters. I would have given the book one star, but the story is compelling, amazingly. But the compelling story was not worth the dark dreams that still haunt me after reading it. I don't watch the evening news because I can't stand to hear about children being mistreated. Why in the world would I want to read a whole series of books that dwells in that dark and despicable place? Anne Bishop, I may give another of your series a try, but the Black Jewels series is not one I wish to experience again."
2,Not nearly as good as I'd hoped.,"I found ""Daughter of the Blood"" to be disapointing. The writing itself wasn't bad, but just about everything else was. The characters, despite being in a completely different world, borrow very heavily from the Mythologies of this world. Many of the characters seemed basic and contrived. The society of ""The blood"" is hedonistic to the point of revolting.It takes a lot more than having a people worship ""darkness"" to make a dark fantasy. And it takes a lot more than people having sex (often sadistic, incestuous, demented. I can't think of a single character that had an honest to goodness HEALTHY relationship in the entire book) to make a book erotic.I couldn't feel good about this book. Reading it became a chore and the ending left me disapointed."
5,A Perfect Blend,"I picked up this book a couple of years ago because of a review on amazon.com. Since, I have recommended the series to everyone that asks for a good read. Anne Bishop has found a perfect combination of fantasy, romance, sex, and humor. Incredibly well written, the characters grab you and the story immediately pulled me in. I read Daughter of the Blood, and went out that night to purchase the other two in the trilogy and read them within two days. Indeed these books are very enchanting, I have re-read the series about 6 times now. Very dark, detailed, and consuming - 5 stars."
1,Junk.,"Sucked. ""Broken on his spear""? Jeez. It's basically a silly and not particularly well-written ""romance"" novel (a genre which I generally despise) with fantasy overtones. Or is that redundant? I tossed it after reading half way through it."
1,First time for everything,This is the first time in a long time that I couldn't finish a book. Sometimes I will put a book down for a while and try later. This book is like the ravings of a serial demon possessed rapist. I actually tossed this one in the trash and that's saying something.
1,Just terrible.,"I could not finish this book, I could not bring myself to read anymore... I do not want to read about children being abused, this is not entertainment, its sick. this was a blind purchase and has made me rethink getting a book on a whim without reading a review (or the dust cover) first. never again."
1,Terrible,"this book really is horrible. it's just a sort of kinky romance novel with some cliched fantasy thrown in. The characters are extremely one dementional, and the plot is actually very nonsensical. Skip this one."
5,Love this series,This is my favorite series. I can read them over and over. Love them!!!! The characters are terrific and the story lines are interesting!!
5,Go buy it NOW!,"This is the best book I have ever read in my entire life and I have read many books, especially fantasy books. I read it at least three times in the first week I got it and I loved it more and more every time. I didn't love it despite its gruesome parts either. I loved it partially because of them. They really gave you background on the characters and what drives them. It also makes it more amazing when Anne manages to make it a romance and even funny at the same time. She is a fantastic writer and no other book will stisfy me until I read the last one, Queen of the Darkness. January is a loooooooong time. Anyway, if you haven't read it what the hell are you thinking after reading all these rave reviews? Get up and go get it this instant!"
5,Yes!!!!!!!,"I can't really put into words how much I LOVED this book. I only bought it because of the cover...but I'm glad I did and I'll never say a bad word about it! I tried to give a report to my english class about it, but it's one of those you just have to read."
5,good,This is a good book the only problem its a slightly perverted. So if you are offended by sexual stuff this isn't a book for you. But its a great book. Anne Bishop is a great author. You can't put it down if you like fanasty.
3,A good bad book,"I've read all three books in this series, and I still don't understand why. Many aspects of the plot seem arbitrary, and so are the characters' names. There are times when the author seems unable to decide whether to be dark or whether to be cutesy, so she does both. This book is probably the best of the series, since it's the most punchy. The premise is interesting, and the story is just rich enough to make me wonder ""what happens next?"" Still, this series is like eating cotton candy - it tastes good at the time, but it's not made of much."
4,Daughter of the Blood (bk. 1 of the Black Jewels Trilogy,"This book is one of the best books I've ever read. It focuses mostly on the relationship between Daemon and Jaenelle by showing the love between the two. I was almost unable to put it down! It should be a good book for everyone no matter what your taste in books. I felt that I was left hanging at the end, but Ms. Bishop had already written the other two - Heir to the Shadows and Queen of the Darkness - and so got to finish the trilogy right away. I was very pleased with it and think you will be too."
5,"One of the BEST, BEST, BEST trilogies I have ever read!","I have to say that this trilogy was the best I have ever read. It is compelling, compassionate, and a wonderful read. I could never put them down. The characters become so alive and so easy to relate to/understand. These books make you want to laugh, cry, and feel happy, relieved, and sad for characters. The world is so well described and created that all parts are easily imaginable and vivid. These were such great books! I reccommend them to anyone with an open mind and looking for a great fantasy read!"
5,A triumph for dark sci-fi,"Aboslutely incredible. Not for the average reader to be sure, due to some graphic material, but if you like dark and desperate situations, here's one for you. Bishop's world is richly detailed, and has some great characters, but nothing is bogged down by long-winded descriptions. And the best part is that you root more for the 'supporting characters', than for the 'main character'. I read it in a day, and can't wait for the sequel to come out."
5,WOW!!!,"After over 100 reviews on this book there is not too much left to say - other than- A GREAT book.... An ENTHRALLING plot.... .... COMPELLING characters...VERY WELL written..... and just LOTS AND LOTS of fun to read!! I read this novel during vacation and am not quite sure what happened during the two days it took me to finish . One might think that two uninterrupted days is a bit too long to read a book especially if you are as avid reader as I am. However, I find that reading fantasy books requires much stamina with lots of concentration and persistance to get all salient points. Anyway, I just loved this story and am so thankful I waited several years before starting the trilogy so I can follow the adventures of Queen Jaenelle, Saetan, Daemon,Lucivar, and Surreal. I look forward to seeing how this very special ""Witch- child"" matures and at least know that I won't ""age"" too much between books."
2,Not for me...,"A friend recommended this book to me since I enjoyed the Twilight series. It took me a while to get into it, about 100 pages or so,and for a while I enjoyed it. The names were sort of annoying and the world she created was irritating, the whole ""ring of obedience"" grossed me out, too. I still kept going with it, though, since my friend kept raving about it and asking me where I was in the book. Before I finished it, she gave me the next two so I go right into them. I'm not going to. The last 50 or so pages were soooooo distasteful and out of left field. I just found it totally disgusting. I agree with the other reviewers who found it repulsive and wonder what the author was THINKING. If you want to be grossed out and worry about children being ripped apart by perverted me, just open the paper. Why read a whole book that ends so appallingly? Gag."
5,Highly talented writer!,"This author is really really good, right up there with my top five favorites and I am so glad I found her books! I highly recommend reading all her books."
1,Awful. Poorly written,"I see no point in this sloppily written book. Some moderately clever concepts, but just why anyone would buy it I dunno"
1,H O R R I F I E D,"I read the cover of this book at Powell's, finding that one of my favorite authors - Charles de Lint - loved it. And so I trusted him. I can't believe that I did.Now let me begin by saying that I AM NOT a religious person, but this book's Satanic referrances frightened me. Every character has a referance to some demonic representation. Fantasy is supposed to be about magic and wonder and good vs. evil, not evil's corruption of the innocent and rise to power. This book has only sex, anger, distrust, violence and greed - nothing good, interesting or enlightening within. If you want good, richly written fantasy, I'd recommend Charles de Lint's early books, Lloyd Alexander, Margaret Weis and Ursula K Le Guin.This book disgusts me."
3,Engaging story but violent,"Thought this was a good story and I was totally engrossed with the plot and characters. However, this is a book with a lot of violence and sad themes (like slavery), and I am a sensitive reading cat - probably more sensitive than most. Not sure if I will continue with the trilogy or not."
4,"Showerhead good, materials cheap","I purchased this shower head in August 2010, and it worked fine up until last week. The piece that attaches to the plumbing and holds up the shower head broke off, and it looks like it isn't replaceable. That means I either need to hold the shower head in my hands the entire time I'm bathing or I need to deal with duct tape to keep it in place. I wish the cheap plastic part could be purchased separately, so I could make this product fully functional again. Like someone else said in an earlier review, cheap materials make a good product into a bad idea! Despite the fact the holder is broken, the shower head is still usable, just not completely so."
2,"Great idea, poorly executed","The showerhead works, however the long arm creates a problem with the angle of the showerhead. In my average size shower, the water was going over my head and hitting the rear wall. The only solution was to angle the unit to one side and turn the head down. It looked odd but worked for a while. The plastic clamp that holds the showerhead broke last week - the product is less than 6 months old."
3,"Great in theory, but the art supplies were lacking","I bought this as a Christmas gift for a 5 year old niece who has everything. She was excited about it and wanted me to help her decorate it immediately. All of the glitter pens were completely dried up and couldn't be used. The glue was messed up, too. We ended up using our own glue and glitter. It is a fun idea but you should be prepared to use your own materials, you'll need some scissors, too for cutting the ribbon and rope."
5,what? you dont like horse-head bookends?,One of the greatest epics to ever grace the silver screen. This movie did for eggplants what leatherface did for the chainsaw; made them TERRIFYING!This movie was the Scream of is time only more tongue in cheek. It pointed out some of the flaws or recurring themes in the horror genre and made them hilarious.Great movie if you like spoofs and 80's references.
3,You will know if this is your type of movie in 5 minutes,"It wasn't my type of movie. It is kind of a Mel Brooks kind of humor, with crude jokes, that some people like, but others hate. You can tell in 5 minutes if you like it or not. I gave it 3 stars for potential. If you love 80s horror movies you may love it."
4,You know what's between horse-head bookends...,"Yes! Finally! I. CANNOT. WAIT. This movie makes those Scary Movies look like doodie. This is so bizarre and out there, it's hard to describe. Sign me up! I doubt the present generation will understand the humor. It's more of an homage to the horror films of the late 70s and early 80s, and is no way slick -- nor does it pay any homage -- to the slicker films of recent years. Its low budget, no frills silliness is it's charm."
5,2 Thumbs and 2 big toes UP for this movie!!!!!,This movie is one of the best of the spoof movie genre. I saw this when it first came out and it was so funny that I've never forgotten it. 5 stars doesn't nearly cover how good this movie is.You simply MUST have this movie the moment it comes out on DVD...which better be SOON!!!!
4,"Before there was ""Scary Movie"", there was ""Student Bodies""","Fantastic 80s horror movie spoof, still funnier than any of the ""Scary Movie"" films. I remember first seeing this on VHS back in the 80s, and simply loved all the humor. Very much in the ""Naked Gun"" or ""Airplane"" style, there are quite a few ongoing jokes combined with many unique ideas. If you are a fan of 80s horror, you've got to see this. The DVD has no extra features, so that keeps me from going with 5 stars."
5,classics are coming back,I saw this movie when it first came out at the theatre. It was extremely funny then and it is still funny today.It is about time they brought this to DVD.
3,who doesn't love horse head bookends?,"As stated on the cover, this was the world's first horror-spoof.Idiotic, slapstick comedy typical of movies like the Naked Gun and suckfests like Epic Movie.The movie starts off with a bang (death by paper clip, anyone?) and the on-screen body count throughout is amusing, but it just seems to drag on and on and on. when everything's said and done, this movie is simply too stupid for it's own good.Thank god for my PS3. I watched the last 20 minutes on time and a half speed."
5,Amazing horror/comedy.,One of the funniest movies I have ever seen! I watch it regularly. Puts me in a good mood. I can't recommend this movie enough!!!
3,"great, classic horror/comedy","Silly and stupid, but thats the point. Really funny classic horror spoof. Makes fun of Halloween and friday the 13th, plus has its own style as well. Fun, silly good time."
1,this sucked,I think maybe you have to be from the 80s in order to appreciate this movie. I am not from the 80s..... so i thought it sucked ;(
1,ONE STAR IS WAY TOO HIGH FOR THIS ONE.,"Student Bodies it unarguably the most dreadful movie I have ever seen, that is saying something since I was born in 1946. I could have gotten past the lack of talent of the actors if maybe at least there was a good plot but I can't even give them that much credit. I'm sorry I can't tell you how it ended but I got so fed up with the heavy breathing of the killer that I just had to stop the movie. After a few days I could still not convince myself that it would be worth my time so took it to a local book store and sold it for $1.00. I'm glad they just gave me the money and didn't take my address down; otherwise once they previewed it for resale they might realize that they just got ripped off."
1,"""Scary Movie"" this is NOT!","Just a few minutes into the movie I could tell this was a dud. Sadly I wasted my time thinking it had to get better - It doesn't!Its too absurd to be a horror or slasher flick and too dreadfully acted to be funny.There is a minor twist in the end, but by then it was just too stupid be engaging of the viewer."
3,o.g. spoof,"this is the original horror movie spoof.forget ""scary movie"" ""shriek! whatever the hell the rest of this title is"" and ""scream""yes, this is a dumb movieyes, the acting is badhowever, it is so bad that its funnyi suggest you watch this high"
3,Pretty funny movie,"The main villain called ""The Breather"", in this film is just hilarious. We never see his face, or really learn his motives behind his killings, but he is just funny. His heavy breathing and observations on things will leave you laughing. He is about the only good thing to this movie that is filled with sub par performances and a plot that just goes nowhere."
3,Not as Great As I Remembered,"This was bought because of the funny memories I had of this movie from my teens; unfortunately, I should have just kept those memories."
4,Fascinating,"Truly an amazing story! Skunk Works has built the most advanced planes ever, in total secrecy.From the U-2 thru the SR-71 and the F-117 up to the F-22, this book details the trials and tribulations of a small, focused division of a huge aerospace conglomerate. Fascinating insight into the shooting down of Gary Powers over the USSR, frank discussion of decision making in the U.S. Military, not-so-subtle snipes at the traditionalists in the U.S. Navy, behind the scenes wrangling, and the low down on the F-117 Stealth fighter.I got this book as a gift when Lockheed and Martin merged, it's a shame that the entire company can't be as effective as this one small division."
5,This books is one personal favorites,I really like the skunk works. Even though he witheld information about Aurora. It is about the development of Top Secret aircraft. It is particularly interesting the development of the Stealth Fighter. I like the tribute to Kelly Johnson the creator of SR-71 despite that name was given by a policitian. It was Reconnaissance Strategic but the error stuck. It is good book aviation.
2,not quite in the condition described,"Listed as ""like new"", the book was previously an unused library book. But it still had stamps in it and location numbers taped on the spine. Refunded $1..."
4,good album,"I really enjoy this album. It is very fresh, honest, and real. I look forward to more work similar to this album."
4,a pleasant surprise,"I had heard one of Webb's songs when I decided to just go ahead and buy the whole CD -- good decision. Solid from start to finish; great lyrics, excellent musicianship."
4,Derek Webb,"This is an excellent example of Derek Webb's ability to write catchy tunes, although I think it's slightly less socio-political than his previous albums. Someone dropped the word ""masterpiece"" describing this album, I disagree. I'd use the word ""great"", but not a masterpiece, and not as lyrically deep as Mockingbird or I See Things Upside Down, which are closer to masterpieces.Nevertheless, this albums is one of my favourites by Webb because he shows his knack for catchy melodies, such as ""I Wanna Marry You All Over Again"" and ""Name"". ""Savior on Capitol Hill"" and ""This Too Shall Be Made Right"" seem a bit out of place on a predominately pop album, but they show Derek's true heart. Looking forward to his new releases."
4,"It's quite good...not amazing, though","I have been searching for Christian music that breaks the mold. Derek Webb has definitely put out some music that has done so. However, this album seems to be one that is accepted by the American ""Christian culture"". It's good, though...the songs ""The End"", ""This too shall be made right"", and ""Savior on Capitol Hill"" have excellent lyrical content, and will make you think about where you stand on life and how the government is relied on to solve our problems. Long story short...buy the album, it's got some solid songs on it."
4,Did the job,"Exactly what the description says......It is definitely nice wrapping paper, and very thick so it doesn't tear easily on corners like cheap paper. I enjoyed it."
4,Must Have for Yankee Lovers,great paper for birthday gifts for Yankee Fans - or Yankee Haters! two sheets per package and they can wrap a large box.
3,Good Paper,"It's really thick and good quality. It comes with two sheets. However, even with the two sheets it's still really expensive for wrapping paper, but if you want Yankees paper, I don't know of many choices."
4,MLB New York Yankees Wrapping Paper,Well how much can anyone really say about wrapping paper? If you have a Yankees fan in the house then this paper should be just fine for wrapping gifts for any occasion.
2,Where's the Beef?,"I thought this movie had a lot of bull in it. Dont get me wrong I'm A huge fan of Ray Ramano & Kevin james, but they just did't have the funny in them in this movie. I found myself a bit pissed off when the movie ended. Because the 2 really funny guy's in grilled left there funny in Everybody Loves raymond and king of queens. Dissapointment filled my mind and I considerd smashing the dvd. At least Kevin James has king of queens to go back to. Ray on the other hand, needs to find out what Tim allen's gonna star in next and steal it from him, ever since his show home improvement ended he's been getting real good movie roles. What's up RAY? Dont sell out just for the money! Start another TV show or something!"
1,This isn't the Ray and Doug we've come to know and love. . .,"This movie is in one word "" tedious "". I was goning to go with "" unfunny "" but I did laugh once.Ray and Kevin are so type cast as Ray and Doug that it's hard not seeing them as those characters. A beard and messed up hair doens't change the fact that we're watching two very well known TV characters.There is so much foul language in this film I was kind of shocked. I'm no prude but it seems it was all done to try and change the nice guy image of Ray and Kevin. That's the only explanation I can imagine for the profanity overload. In my opinion this movie isn't going to help advance either guys career from the small screen to the big screen."
3,Could have been so much more,"Ray Romano and Kevin James starring in a feature length comedy...Well, that creates anticipation...The pic doesn't really live up to the potential that these two really funny guys can do with the right material. Ofcourse there are laughs here and there, 'cause they both have undeniable talent, but overall it's somewhat of a missed chance and only interesting for real fans of the two...Too bad, I must say...."
1,Waiting for something to happen,"If you think a movie about high-quality beef salesman might be funny, go ahead & get this movie. Reality is that the plot is stupid and lacks any real purpose, the acting is poor.Spoiler alert - they have the audacity to interrupt a promising love scene with Sofia Vergara by telling Joe Montana's character that Sofia used to be a guy.How sick is that!"
1,stinks wasted talents/no stars,wasted my money time and the two stars talents could have been or should have been a little funny...
1,When was it filmed?,I was misled by the DVD distribution date. The movie must have been made prior to the Ramano and James entry into sit coms. You kept watching thinking it might get better and it doesn't. You are distracted by the 80's type world that you don't expect. I was disapppointed in what I had hoped would be a good movie.
4,If this movie starred Tim Roth and said TARANTINO somewhere on the cover...,"...and kept the same script, it would have been received much much better. Doug and Ray as the stars are throwing alot of people off who expect to pop this DVD in and see 'Doug' and 'Ray.' This is well written and well acted. It reminds me of alot of 90's black comedies like Get Shorty and Eight Heads in a Duffle Bag. This is severely underrated and I see this being a cult classic in the future. 5 years from now when this DVD is no longer in print, it will go for 40 bucks at auction web sites. Get your copy now."
2,Two funny guys deserving of better fare....,"It pains me to write a negative review about a movie with Kevin James , because I'm a huge fan of his work on 'The King of Queens' and even the movie Hitch, but alas, I can see why this movie never got much in the way of promo, and it's a shame, because James and Ray Romano CLEARLY have great chemistry together in this movie, but the wishy washiness of the script just trumps all the funniness they have together...The premise of the movie was just too prefabricated, and not original or clever at all. It felt like a poorer adaptation of Chris Farley and David Spade in 'Tommy Boy'! Here's hoping they both get to work together again in something that matches their higher comedic caliber than what this movie offers."
1,Maybe I missed something,"Maybe my sense of humor is off, maybe I'm not smart enough to understand the movie or maybe my tolerance for pain is lower than that of certain other people, I dunno. I do know that I ejected the movie after about 20 mins, utterly bored."
1,Lousy Taste,"Didn't like this movie at all. Struck me as two TV comedic stars desperate for a movie. I couldn't even stand this movie enough to finish it. It wasn't funny and both actors seemed out of place and trying too hard for a laugh. And I consider myself a Ray Romano fan, probably why I rented this movie in the first place."
1,"Painfully slow, awful","I can't believe two such great actors could produce such a slow, unfunny movie. It had so much potential.It was simply awful. Painfully slow and uneventful. Predictable. I had to fast-forward through much of it - it just went nowhere.I can't find anything nice to say about this movie."
5,A Powerful Human Story for Everyone,"The author is a woman who had a baby at the age of twenty, in 1947, and gave her son up for adoption. Then, almost fifty years later, her son found her. She writes with spare elegance and unsparing honesty, and you will be hooked on the story from the first word you read. She describes with detailed frankness all of her very mixed feelings as each stage of the relationship with her son unfolds, and they gradually get to know each other. Details like, how to handle a new extended family at the holidays, are endearing to the reader. Adopted children and adoptive parents will find this book fascinating, as will birth-parents. But the quality of writing and the sheer humanness of the story make it a book that appeals to a much wider audience."
5,Just what I needed,"Upgraded the thermostat housing, thermostat and thermostat sensors on my 2001 sport to the 2004-2005 sport trac version all for under $70 and this was one of the pieces I needed. Only wish it came with the retainer clips to hold it down, got those from a local dealer for pennies on the dollar though."
2,aka Scandal In The City,"Made in UK in 1996, Serial# CDPUNK-78, Playing Time 68:25Also released in Germany as ""Scandal In The City"", this 20-track compilation is mostly taken from the band's singles.Tracks 1 to 3 are the ""Obsessed"" single; tracks 4 to 6 are the ""Little Red Riding Hood"" single; tracks 7 to 9 are the ""Indian Reservation"" single; tracks 10 to 12 are the ""Wild Sun"" 12"" single; tracks 13 and 14 are previously unreleased; tracks 15 to 17 are the ""13th Floor Madness"" single, but track 16 is an alternate version; tracks 18 to 20 are from the ""13th Floor Madness"" album, but in alternate versions.Useful for the completist as it contains many tracks not previously released on CD, it remains an eclectic collection of material since b-sides are often left out of the album for a reason..."
4,"Pay no mind to the weak picture of this item, it looks great","I ordered this for my wife for christmas. Now, she hasn't actually had a chance to use it yet, so this review is rather preliminary, but she loves it. I was a little worried about the generic grey cushion in the image, but it came in Lowes blue with the #48 logo on it, and looks good.Next to the season tickets to our nearest speedway, this was her favorite gift!"
1,Ehh..It has its moments,"This book was required for my FamMed clerkship. I like the general format and flow of it, but it doesn't provide much in the way of strong clinical guidelines ""rules of thumb"" that you need to make decisions in the real world; memorizing the endless epi / study data presented is useless.Fatal Flaw: This is the FIFTH edition of this book. (If I understand that correctly, it means it has been re-edited and re-printed 5 times.) The number of typos is absurd and unacceptable. One or two is understandable, but after a while, you start to get the feeling that no one really cared enough about this book to bother with proof reading it. Spelling errors are annoying. The WORST is when they use an abbreviation(eg ATFL) and define it as one thing (anterior talofibular ligament) and then use it to mean other things a few pages later (anterior tibiofibular ligament...fyi, these are not the same ligaments...) SO ANNOYING!"
2,Not a good reference book,"This book was ""required"" reading at my med school, and NO ONE found it helpful. It had a very general overview of concepts, but was not good for a reference book or for studying for the shelf exam. As a resident, I wouldn't waste my time with it either."
1,Incorrect diabetes information,"In addition to the typos (for example, ""thiomeresol""), this book says ""initial self management of hyperglycemia asks the patient to substitute some carbohydrates for others"" and goes on to state that ""concentrated forms of sugar"" are ""to be avoided"". As evidence supporting this statement, the authors refer to the American Diabetes Association's 2004 statement on ""Nutrition Principles and Recommendations in Diabetes."" What the ADA statement actually says is ""intake of sucrose and sucrose-containing foods by people with diabetes does not need to be restricted because of concern about aggravating hyperglycemia."""
5,Great Textbook,"This is a great text for medical students and an excellent review for a fourth year looking to start intern year. Lots of common sense ""wisdom."" -Fourth Year Med Student. Shipped as expected, quickly."
3,could be more concise,"This book is a good resource for the student that is just being introduced to family med and if you want to get an idea of the field and treatment/perspective of family med physicians, but for studying for boards it would be better to get a more concise book."
2,useless,"whatever you do, don't get this book. don't get the new version either. Unless your clerkship demands that you use it and bases all its curriculum around it (including using the exam written by the same authors), then it's not worth it. It's painful to read, and overpriced for its paper quality and medical content.And so far the opinion has held for all my classmates as well.If you can borrow it from a classmate, do so. If you must buy it, then buy it used."
4,Family practice review,This is a very good book which gives an overall review of family medicine. Would recommend it for medical students and family practice residents
2,Thin on content and explanations.,"I bought this book because it received high customer reviews. However, this book is quite disappointing as it lacks details and gives very little explanation. Its price is also pretty high especially when considering the amount of content (which is very little). The examples in the book are few and rudimentary. Where is the beef??"
3,"OK introduction, needs proofreading","This book is an OK introduction to networking, but has enough typos and contextual ambiguities to warrant a new edition. It walks a tightrope between giving a general overview and avoiding distracting details, a task rendered difficult by use of a protocol analyzer software which by definition exposes the reader to protocol details... this is sometimes not a bad thing as it makes you think and reflect (as do the typos and other mistakes :-) both within and beyond the scope of what the writer is saying about a particular topic.The choice of top-down exposition of the Internet Protocol Stack layers has its problems, as this results in 'forward references' to lower-level material not yet explained, esp. due again to the use of the protocol analyzer which tantalizes us with details of the current and lower-level layers. A bottom-up approach might have been better.The price is too high for the content given."
4,Promote imagination,"What a wonderful way to start a child on the path of imagination.Perhaps the best thing about *The Great Kettles* is that, though the story is fun and fanciful, it's not necessary. It's so much more rewarding to let a child look at the illustrations and create his or her own story. And not only children--I've found great inspiration in the colorful and detailed illustrations that grace every page.Dean Morrissey's books should be on every child's bedside table."
1,I wish S.K. wrote this!,It was bad. Don't get it. If Stephen King wrote it it would be 10 times better.
4,Landscape photographing as distance,"This book is deeply evocative of some aspects of the Yellow Mountains - moods and mists, trees and cliffs, light and shadows - all stunningly rendered in black and white. The rivers, however, are missing, and so are close-ups of vegetation, wildlife, and rocks. Yet Chinese paintings always give space to them: indeed harmony cannot exist without them.The introductory essay is slow and profound. The hurried Lonely-Planet-style description of the region and its ecology at the end is quite out of place."
3,Color film would have turned marvelous into breathtaking,"Having visited and climbed this magnificent mountain, I was prepared for some wonderful photos and I wasn't disappointed. But, the vast majority of them are in black and white. I do not understand this choice for EVERYTHING when the use of color film would have made such a spectacular difference in most cases. The absence of color suggests a sameness from page to page. The book's saving grace is a section at the back where there are twelve stunning photos in color."
5,A parody of French romance that is a French romance.,"I remember seeing this when it came out, and I still have my vhs copy from long ago. I don't understand how anyone could call this too pretentious. Too farcical or silly maybe. But lines like, 'I vomited on your rug,' 'Take my rug but leave my husband' are pure comedy. It's a mockery of the pretentious. (Is that over the head of the local audience?) I think it's a really lovely movie that impressively combines comedy and drama."
2,Not Crazy about this film,The only reason I bought this DVD is because it had Gerard Depardieu in it. I love all his period pieces. But this was just crazy with a crazy ending. I was not pleased with this film.
4,A Charming Little Film,"This film is definately charming, and is different from most of the main sream films.A man, who has a beautiful wife and children, falls in love with his frumpy-dressing average-looking secretary. He makes love to her, cheating on his wife.His wife becomes aware of this, but instead of leaving him, she tries to be the woman of his dreams, but cannot suceed. He discovers that a woman with no imperfections is not desirable, there is nothing more to want from her.What happens in the end is for you to discover."
2,pretentious nonsense,"Depardieu plays a car salesman who falls in love with his ordinary-looking temporary secretary, despite being married to a gorgeous wife. The premise was promising but the result disappointing.In general I'm a lover of French cinema but it does have a tendency to get preachy and pseudo-intellectual -- and that's what happens in this movie. We get lines of dialogue like this:Mistress: I've vomited on your rug.Wife: Take the rug. Leave my husband.Sometimes the characters step out of character and deliver lines as if they were spectators or critics. Sometimes, they come together for absurd dinner parties and in one scene for a wedding at which they deliver ridiculous speeches in the manner of ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie."" But in general, this is a sloppy, pretentious movie of little charm or worth."
2,Not that good,"I like Gerard Depardieu, but this movie was not good. It seemed almost unrealistic. Gerard is not convincing in this role. It was clear there was no chemistry between he and Josiane Balasko (his secretary). Just not believable. Sorry."
5,Good Arranging Book,I found this to be an excellent book on arranging for the person new to it or for someone like myself who hasn't done much lately and wishes to get back into it. The recorded examples help a lot as I can remember when the books only gave the written music and you had to hunt down the recordings to hear the actual music played. The book is well done and has many examples of different musical styles and a variety of different voicings. I enjoy this book very much.
3,Rushed Eroica,"The editorial review is technically accurate. But it does not emphasize the bottom line: that a performance as rushed as this is leaves little room for nuance. Sure, the conductor can try to modulate the dynamics, or emphasize or deemphasize a sforzando here or there, but it is so fast that there is no room for noticeable rubato or crescendo or diminuendo within a given note.These are the the big items that the great conductors of the past used to interpret music. For example, compare this to the great Monteux/Concertgebouw performance and it comes up lacking.Doug McDonald"
2,"Good Content, competing static background.","This cd is a fairly typical example of it's type. A 40 min. Q and A sesion with the band, and Cobain in particular. The reviewer asks questions that are a little more daring then most asked of Nirvana or other bands of their genre. There is however, an underlying buzzing noise that begins at the comemencement of the interview and most likley goes to the end. (I'm not sure, I couldn't stand to hear it that long.) the interivew is better than most, but be prepared to digest it in segments, because taking it all at once will drive you insane."
3,disappointing,"Although my granddaughters were delighted with their jewelry boxes, I was not all that impressed. The photos on the web were somewhat misleading. There were pictures of jewelry boxes in two different colors, leading me to believe that they could be painted differently (a plus when buying for twins), but they arrived already painted. Also, the tray shown in the photo does not actually fit inside the box!"
3,Not that great,The girls (3 and 5 year old) liked working and designing the box but got bored after a while. too expensive for the materials and the quality of the box.
2,Does not stay decorated,"Both my girls received this as a gift. They were so excited to create their own jewelry box. Disappointed. I usually love Melissa and Doug products, but this one, not so much. The embellishments do not stay on the box. I would not recommend this item."
4,Good resource,"Good resource for synonyms, although I also recommend Using Spanish Synonyms by Batchelor."
5,Wonderful,"It's a really wonderful product! So simple and so useful. After 40 years old the eyes are not so good as before. It's cheap and works better than that one by Clover, which is good, but threads only thin needles. This one have two sides: one for thin needles and the other for thick needles. I recommend and I suggest also the Needle Threader for Sewing Machine (INFILA as well)""EZ-IN"" Needle Threader for Sewing Machine. Really awesome!"
1,Nonfunctional!,"I am a pretty patient person and I did try very hard, many times, to get this thing to thread my thin needle. No luck!"
1,Ry Cooder,"Although the first and second track were my favourite, it is a good album and Would recomend if you want a chill out music."
2,"Sadly, it's like a boring history lesson","I've been a big fan of Mr. Cooder's previous work (ex., see my customer review of Mambo Sinuendo), but I literally fell asleep while listening to this album. So after listening to it again while AWAKE, I'd like to be more specific about my disappointment. I think the basic problem is the ""concept album"" idea behind Ry's reflection on an aspect of his SoCal childhood. There are a few mildly catchy and/or entertaining songs, but there's also WAY too much mumbling about topics such as the persecution of suspected ""Reds."" The vocals are sometimes pretty awful, whether Mr. Cooder's or a guest's. And too many of the songs just drag along with a very slow tempo. I'm sure this will appeal to a very narrow audience of people who live in the Chavez Ravine area, or those interested in California history. But I'm also very sure I won't be the only Cooder fan making a beeline to get rid of this turkey."
2,not his best,"I am a Ry Cooder fan, and this is not his best. I was quite dismayed and it is one of the C.D's I never listen to. If you are looking for good Ry Cooder, this is not the one to buy."
5,Eye-opening,"It's hard to know what to expect reading the descriptions and reviews of this album, so anyone listening to this for the first time has a good chance of hearing something new to them. This album is meant to portray the people and the culture of Chavez Ravine, a Mexican-American community that was torn down in order to build a baseball stadium in the 1950s. The story is told through the music, and the culture of the people of Chavez Ravine is also portrayed through the songs, some newly-composed and some peformed by the pachuco musicians of the area. The booklet included with the CD has English and Spanish translations of all the songs as well as a description of what part of the story each song tells. The musicianship of all the singers and musicians is superb, and while the UFO subplot is strange, it all fits together well. I definitely recommend making time to sit down and listen to this whole CD with the included booklet - the journey is well worth the time."
2,ambient sothingness,"The 1st and 2nd discs in the outland series are extremelly ambient. Except the 2nd one is ambient on and off with some eastern and electronic with bass but mostelly ambient. 3 and 4 are electro dub charged with awesome samples and ethnic music throughout. In my opinion i prefer the dark side of the moog ambient stuff. Their sceems to be more structure to the ambience their pink floyd ambient very inthralling more actual keyboard sothingness instead of soft texturless ambience. The psychonavigation 1, 2 aRE also very ambient little more structure but not really"
5,This One Had Me at Hello!!,"I'm the girl who just loves a good murder mystery, trying to figure out the murder beforeit is finally revealed by the author. I must say, Mr. Hubbard had me stumped again. I didnot get this one at all. I've read several of his murder mysteries and he has a flair forkeeping you guessing the entire story. This is no different. Another thing, I felt like Iwas there! Right there in the story. He paints such vivid landscapes of every scene thatyou actually feel like you are there! I don't know how he does it. Highly recommended."
5,LOVE WeatherTech!,We have a 2007 Toyota 4Runner and got the WeatherTech to replace all of the floor mats. We are so happy we did; living in Colorado makes them a necessity and they are so easy to take out and hose off when necessary. The color matches perfectly and they fit like they were made for the truck. Thanks!
1,1 of 2 worked for a millisecond.,"I ordered 2 of these. One of them was not even assembled correctly, the loose fitting was obviously broken and did not seal the glass enclosure. The second light blew as soon as I turned it on. I don't know if GE messed up on quality control or if the light was damaged after it left the manufacturing site. I hope you have better luck than I did if you elect to order this product from this seller."
4,Very Windows based,"This book is pretty good as a starter for anyone wanting to get into 3D game development. It not only covers OpenGL, but OpenAL and Multiplayer issues as well (not in the same depth of course).My only complaint is that while it promotes OpenGL as the choice for multi-platform graphics, all the code examples and information on OpenGL are Windows specific, to the point of using the opengl32.lib and glu32.lib libraries in all the code.Still, the book is well worth the price, just don't expect to make Doom 4 after reading it!"
3,"Classic, Low Budget ""Taxi Driver"" Ripoff","""God's Lonely Man"" is a classic, low budget ""Taxi Driver"" ripoff, that includes the main guy who looks, dresses and acts just like De Niro, but not quite as well of course.Director Frank Von Zerneck Jr, has definately seen ""Taxi Driver""a number of times, and good on him. So have I. He obviously loved it so much, he copied it and added a few scenes of his own. In particular, a disturbing little scene that includes a cameo by one of my favourite actors Tom Towles, (who played Otis Toole in ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"") again playing another twisted, sleazy scumbag.Cheap and nasty, and all the better for it. Magic stuff!!!"
4,Nice buy,"This product is a great buy and the only relaxer which after serveral uses continues to straighten my hair w/out a lot effort or breakage. Usually a relaxer only straigtens my hair once or twice, and then never again after. They always burn like crazy. This one seems to be the most gentle and the only one that will continue to work. It does tingle and sometime burn, but not as bad as other relaxers I've used. I started using this some years ago when a friend suggested it to me and have stuck w/ it every since because it works and has a great line of other products to go w/ it that are great for my hair type. The only problem I have is the amount of relaxer. I've been buying the smallest continer, but since my hair is very thick and has grown out so much this is onlly enough for one application. If you have long thick hair like I do you might want to get one of the bigger sizes as I will next time."
5,Nice and shiny,I Love the product it was very affective and it works wonders it left my hair shiny and bouncy! I will continue to use this and the rest of motions products now and in the future!! Thank you
1,MUST POST INGREDIENTS!!!!,"As a customer, making an informed decision is crucial, especially in the case when purchasing anything with chemical ingredients. As a customer I need to know whether or not this product is a sodium hydroxide (lye) based or no lye product, it does make a difference and knowing what other ingredients are added can help as well. Thanks in advance for updating your Detailed Description."
3,Uncomfortable Seams,I usually love all of Cuddl Duds products but these pants didn't function well for me. I bought them to wear under my lighter running pants to get me through the winter but the seams on the inside and outside of the pant legs were uncomfortable and somewhat chaffing.
2,cheesy latino movie,if you are an fan of cheesy latino crime movies this is a winner....soooo baaad it is good...
5,A masterpiece.,"This movie deals with mechanisms behind money-making in early capitalism and it probably is more current now than it had been 27 years ago, when it was produced, as Poland and Eastern Europe is undergoing historical changes after a fall of communism. It shows a main hero, brilliantly played by Daniel Olbrychski, sacrificing his moral backbone on the way to a success at all cost. This movie is brutal and naturalistic. Has great energy and fast pace. Great acting and a beautiful soundtrack by Wojciech Kilar. It is one of the best movies by Andrzej Wajda. I wish I could have it on DVD."
3,A bit to anti semitic for my taste,"This in its time would have been a reasonably big budget film for Poland. It is about the establishment of the textile industry at the turn of the century. A number of young men pool their rescources and decide to build a mill. Unfortunately it burns down and it is not insured. One of the men has to do the unthinkable, yes he has to have sex with a jewish woman to get more money.In fact the portrayal of Jewish people is obnoxious. One scene shows a Jewish club and it is straight out of a Nazi propoganda film.If it wasn't for this the film has a certain amount of vigour and the actors put in strong performances."
3,OKAY,"These aren't vacuum sealed so I don't think they stay fresh too long. The flavor is okay but not great. On the good side I got them subscribe and save so they weren't too expensive. However, after trying them, I took them off of my subscribe and save and won't be buying them again."
1,"WAS GREAT, now OUT OF DATE","This WAS a great book. But unless you are using a Linux distro that is 4 years old...this book is worthless to you.And if you are into Linux, you are NOT about having a 4 year old distro!!! lolOREILLY needs to update this. It is hard though because Linux distros can change or be completely overhauled within 6 months."
4,Having fun with your OS!,"Linux Desktop Hacks: Tips & Tools for customizing your OSBy Nicholas Petreley and Jono BaconO'Reilly PressISBN 0596009119Reviewed by Steven Mullins HuNTUG memberHaving loads of fun with your OS!One of the lures of Microsoft is that it's very simple. One of the reasons we choose to run Linux is the fact that it gets rid of all the extras that we have no real use for.I have just entered into the arena of Linux and have needed a lot of help on how to get more out of my old 450 in the corner. The keys for me were things like terminal transparency, using things like Macromedia Flash in the environment and how to start applications automatically.This book has made my life with Linux a lot easier.The linux desktop hacks gets 4 they could have done some more for that one."
4,Inspirational and Uplifting,"This CD is very uplifting, and includes some of my favorite tracks from Kirk Franklin. I would recommend it for those times when you are feeling down and you need encouragement. This was a good purchase."
3,Heard it all before,All of these songs are from previous CDs- I thought I was getting something new.
3,Fascinating yet dissatisfying,I found this account of a trip up the Yangtze very informative but I was irritated by the way a personal viewpoint was presented by the writer. I wanted a little more distance/objectivity than was provided. I also found it very uneven in the presentation of past events when contrasted to the current experiences of the author. I realise that other readers may prefer this style but for me in lessened the authority of the material presented.
4,Winchester on the Yangszi,"Simon Winchester's books are all excellent reading with lots of facts, even on related matters. This one is no exception. Although I am only one-quarter through with this book, I am learning a lot."
1,Gave up two Chapters in...,The author's writing style is very hard to read. It is poetic and I can appreciate a turn of phrase here and there...but it is quite a slog. He just loads the text with so many little details; he goes on and on about how high the sand banks are and how low this Russian ship or that African ship are in the water...I just didn't care about these details at all...they added absolutely nothing to the narrative and frustrated me to no end. So I decided to abort this trip of the Yangzte...before it even really began. Life is too short than to waste it reading nautical miscellany.
1,Good subject; terrible style,"I agree with Caroline Higgens. I have travelled in China and enjoyed Peter Hessler's ""River Town: Two years on the Yangtze"". I suspected there would be problems right from the beginning when I noticed that Mr. Winchester never expressed in a single sentence what couldn't be expanded into three paragraphs. I reached as far as page 28, where Mr. Winchester writes ""...she could be the ideal companion: when matters became too trying she would brook no nonsense, give no quarter, take no prisoners"".Three cliches in a row is about three more than I want to read."
3,Unbalanced,"Nice, I read the whole book with deep interest and curiosity, but my expectations were quite different. Too many pages are dedicated to the better-known Southern part of the river valley, too many pages on Nanjing or Shanghai and little info about minor towns, which are almost unknown to general public. I wanted to learn more about the Chinese way of life along the valley, not only basic info about the main spots. I'm partially disappointed."
1,"Yes, terribly disappointing!","I agree totally with Yau in the previous review. Mr. Winchester is more interested in sharing the British (yawn) history of China, not giving us much else about the culture and beauty of the Yangtze and its people. I have been to China 2&1/2 wks and also taken a cruise (5 days) of the Yangtze and for him to make it all so boring is more than annoying, it is almost criminal. Perhaps his ego supersedes him. I would not buy this book, in fact I was uanble to even read more than a couple chapters, it was that boring and dry. The one by Mr. Hessler is an absolute winner. I read it once a year at least to refresh my amazing memories of China."
2,Winchester falls short on this one,"As a great fan of travel writing and of Simon Winchester I've got to give a thumbs down for this book. Not very engaging writing. The concept is great - up a river, back in time, but Winchester doesn't really stick to this method - he does go up a river (although sometimes by boat, sometimes by car, sometimes by short flight), but he doesn't go back in time in a very methodical way. He's all over the place in time and brushes on huge events, like Mao coming to power, in the breadth of a single sentence. He doesn't dig deep into anything, he wains poetic then changes his tone to factually dry. Almost 200 pages into the book and I'm still not getting any sense of perspective, color, taste, smell - just a pot of rambling facts and mish-mash.Sorry Simon - not your best work."
4,Great for simple old-time decor...,"What a nice peice of furniture (radio) for a small room. I got it today and I love it alot. It is indeed a CD player, top-loading turn-table incased in a beautiful REAL WOOD veneer cabinet. The CD player is programmable and hidden underneath the nice wood door on top. This is not the cheap wood I though it would be. It is real and heavy. Maybe needs occasional polishing to keep it nice. This is destined to be a collectible someday.This gives the real 30's - 40's vintage look to your room without the heavy price tag. Adds class. It's brand new so it works well.I gave it only 4 stars because of 1 thing: It doesn't get loud. For me, that's fine. I don't like loud music anyway. Just decorative. But for those of you who are looking for more dynamic room-filling music, stay away from this. This is more subtle and for decor than it is for orchestra-style theater audio.PS> This is NOT an antique radio. It is brand new and it's got 'Nostagia'"
5,Materials Science Laboratory and Demonstration Resource,"There are very few resources for demonstrations and laboratory activities in Materials Science that can be used on the secondary or introductory college level. This is an excellent resource for that class. Some of the links and product sources are dated (such as amorphous metals), but most can either be easily fabricated, or obtained from alternate vendors."
5,Great Reading,"Enjoyed reading about the life of Clayton Moore, The Lone Ranger. Since receiving it I am now in my 3rd reading of it. It seems everytime I find someting new and interesting.I wish he was alive so I could personally talk with him about his adventure doing The Lone Ranger. May his spirit always remain in the hearts of all Americans...You can find out more information about Clayton Moore and The Lone Ranger fan club at www.lonerangerfanclub.com/jr"
5,A Wonder Insight Into Moore's Life,"I ran across this book by accident while browsing different books on Amazon. It immediately appealed to me, I grew up in that era. The book did not disappoint. I especially enjoyed some of the little details that Moore describes such as how he kept his hat from coming off during fight scenes and how every time a picture was taken of him rearing the horse Silver (who they nicknamed Liver Lip!), he received $50. There were so many delightful tidbits in this book. A great read for anyone of any age."
2,Not a book for beginners,"This book is absolutely not for someone wanting to learn hardanger for the first time. It does have some good tips and beautiful pictures. I suppose if one is very familiar with hardanger and has some experience with it, this book would be quite helpful.I purchased it based upon it being ""a complete and practical course,"" but was sorely disappointed from that aspect.However I have enjoyed looking through it and reading it. I am hoping that eventually I will understand the terminology and will get some use out of this book.I was looking for something more detailed with regard to the type of thread, the thread count of the fabric needed, how to secure stitches and what the work should look like from behind. I will admit, I am a ""dummy"" at this point on the subject of hardanger embroidery.A good buy and helpful book, though, if only for inspiration and ideas."
2,Not much better than any Web search engine,"I really wouldn't recommend that any ""Buffy"" fan who's half-way familiar with the Internet get this book. First, it's put together like 'books' I used to create in grade school - cardboard-like cover with copied pages on the inside.Second, there really aren't that many Web sites listed. Go to ""Yahoo"" or ""Alta Vista"" and you'll be able to find more, or to the links page on any halfway decent 'Buffy' site. The author has also ignored some of the more established Web sites, and has neglected to include some of the standout features of the sites that are mentioned.HOWEVER, if you're new to the Internet and looking for an easy way to find some 'Buffy'-related sites, this may be a good buy for you."
3,Could Be Better,"I use the Pharos Pocket Bluetooth GPS with my Del AXIM 50V. My PDA can detect the blutooth activated GPS without any problem but it failed to connected if I chose to connect by the CF slot (another accessory). You have to manually set up the COM link, the auto COM detection mode is useless.The GPS software interface have plenty of room for improvement. Point of interests seacrhing will make you mad...have no idea who came up that idea?!Bottomline..if you got extra money...go for it...still fun to play."
3,Not a fan,"I had to do 3 inner boot replacements and decided I needed a banding tool. I chose this one and I partially regret it. It would have been nice if the piece that twists the band was a little further forward to help with shorter bands. It would also be nice if it could be locked in as opposed to always wanting to fall out while trying to feed the band into it.Once it is set up however, it does work. It pulls the band nicely (after the first 2-3 revolutions) and cuts easily."
5,An amazing part of history of the Western World that no one knows about.,"I read parts of this book, many times. I found it in our synagogue library. The copy I found was published in 1916. It is great source for understanding the glory of Sephardic Judaism. It chronicles how the Jews lived in the Iberian peninsula from the fall of the temple in 70 C.E. until the Inquisition in 1492."
1,"It says ""24-pack"" but you only get 2 light bulbs.","I ordered this product and received 2 light bulbs, not a ""24-pack"" as is stated in the item's title. Beware! It was the most expensive light bulbs I've ever purchased. Contacted Lamps Plus only to be told that I received what I ordered. They were unwilling to even look at the product on Amazon.com. Stated that they aren't responsible for what it says on Amazon.com. Avoid Lamps Plus!"
2,Not a review for the Leonard Maltin film mentioned above,"The Erotic Tales video I'm reviewing has Mira Sorvino on the cover as pictured, and is 4 short stories. The Mira Sorvino one is so forgettable that I can't think of a thing to say, only that Mira doesn't get particularily erotic or nude. The Melvin Van Peebles episode was laughable, repeditive, and again not erotic.....no, only the Ken Russell episode made this worthwhile. Not erotic ""spank"" material to be sure, but it kept me interested, and I found it intriguing, erotic to a degree, and I was dissappointed when that segment finished."
2,Poor Program,"The program is not user friendly at all. The logs to track body fat %, muscle mass, etc. are not included in the program as advertised. The Encore support site appologizes for the glitch in the logs but offers no reslotuion to the problem. I reccomend staying away from this program!"
3,Masterton's latest in the US,"I've been a very big fan of Masterton for years now. He was the best horror author I ever read, beating King, Koontz and McCammon. Yet this book wasn't up to his usual standards at all.Oh, his writing style is still the same - it's just not as scary as is his wont.To me, King lost his ability to tell a good horror story, beginning with ""Thinner"". They all started reading more like regular fiction than horror. ""The House that Jack Built"" actually made me feel scared when I read it at late night, in bed. I'm very concerned that Masterton may be losing his touch as I've seen happen to good horror writers. I'm also pretty disappointed because I've been waiting for a sequel to ""Night Warriors"" (can't remember if that's the right title) so I can see what happened to that baby born of a Night warrior and a demon. It floated away at the very end..."
2,Not his best,"Slow, not at all gripping and I gave up before the end. Not at all convincing. Paperback copy acquired 2 years ago."
3,"Loved it, but didn't hold up","When it comes to buying housewares, I generally obsess for months before finding just the right thing that I feel is worth the investment. After months of searching for a duvet cover after redecorating my master bedroom suite, I saw this and fell in love. Unfortunately, the delicateness of the stitching and fabric, the douvet cover literally started fraying dispite very careful handling and care. After less than 2 years, I had to buy a replacement at the local BB&B store, which - although not nearly as beautiful - has held up much better."
4,They are Good Standard Lightbulbs,Good bulbs. Not five star just because the regular price is ridiculous. On sale (I got them for $4) they are regular good light bulbs.
3,a bit big ...,"for a fridge. It was bigger than I thought it would be as I ordered the exact same one that came with the fridge and this one is twice the size of the original and sticks out a bit so I'm not sure if one day I'll catch it with a glass bottle or something, but otherwise it's fine and does the job."
1,Only one of four worked,"The bulbs arrived in tact, but only one of the four bulbs actually worked. Upon further inspection, the filaments in the non-working bulbs appeared to broken. I'm not sure if the broken filaments were a function of poor quality or of rough handling during shipment/inadequate packaging."
1,Textbook price-gouging going on here.,"$95 for a paperback book is highway roberry.Have been pricing out college textbooks on Ebay, Amazon, and the college bookstore. It's a bloody medieval guild these publishers have going here and professors who insist on the latest editions of texts are aiding and abetting the rip-off.This is monopolisitic practice if I've ever seen it. If the industry doesn't rachet down this greed-fest, someone else will - and as far as I'm concerned, it can't happen too quickly. Shame on you all."
1,Very disappointed,"But by the looks of the other reviews here, I guess I did better than most. It took mine 11 months to break. Worked great (slow to heat up, but that's okay), until yesterday when it started to smell and then smoke came pouring out. After reading other comments I can see it's not worth trying to get it fixed. Now I'll need to buy another hotplate, but it definitely won't be a Toastmaster. I will never buy a Toastmaster product again. For the $40 I paid, it should have lasted a lot longer than 11 months. Don't waste your money."
1,Nice looks but unreliable,"I used this product for about 9 months. The largeburner failed (thermal cutout) then the temperaturecontrol failed the next day (overheated). The unitlooks good and cooks good, but needs to be made morereliable. At the price, its hardly worth sending in forwarranty repair / replacement even if I had saved thereceipt. I will not buy it again"
3,Design Flaw,"I was very happy to discover this hotplate with fully enclosed burners. It makes cleaning easy. I have purchased 7 of these in the last 2 years for my rental apartments. Unfortunately, 3 of them have burned out recently. The inline fuse for the larger burner has burned out in each case. Not a replaceable part. Not sure if they are burning out in normal use or if the burners are left on without food in a pot/pan."
1,"Important, do not purchase this product!","Bad quality, not so durable. Large burner died with 2 months of normal use. I put this product in the trasher."
4,Good performance,"I've had mine going on three years and am very happy with it. It cooks evenly and quickly, and is very easy to clean, which I like. I'm thinking about getting a second one."
2,Good Idea Badly Implemented,"I bought one of these about a year ago. The big burner broke after about a month. I used the small burner almost a year, then it broke too. The cast iron cover on the burner did a good job preventing spikes in the temperature, seems like a good idea. Too bad the rest of it breaks easily. Avoid it until a better manufacturer comes along."
5,Good little Burner,"I bought one of these in 2001 and it broke in 2002 but I still consider worthy of another try. It is a compact and good little burner. It wont set any records in heating up times, takes about 10 minutes to boil but it gets the job done."
1,Slow and gradual demise,"After about 1 year, the knob on the big burner became hard to twist. After another year, the big burner failed completely. From the other reviews, it doesn't seem worth it to get it repaired. Thanks for the info. No thanks to Toastmaster."
2,Another One Bites the Dust...,Like others - the large burner is out - after less than a year of use. Will look for another brand to replace.
5,Great Garden Tool,Stays sharp and is great for pruning. I have been using this tool for a while and definitely recommend it. We have a couple of Fiskars garden tools and couldn't be happier with them!
4,20th Annual Chevy Vette Fest DVD. ok stuff.,"This is a full throttle Video DVD(they make sub-par/cheap dvds somewhat good) this dvd has too many commercials and people representing the companies, Some interviews w/car owners, overall dvd is ok, Was expecting something different."
3,Interesting supplementary reading,"The first half of this book is a model-theoretic introduction to logic for beginning graduate students. It takes an unusual approach in that it emphasizes back-and-forth construction rather than formula satisfaction. The second half is a treatment of stability theory (ca. 1970s) meant for professionals. His style is entertaining, but he often gets to the point in a long and roundabout way. Important points are embedded in the text rather than isolated as definitions and lemmas. Just a couple of the early chapters have exercises and not very many. With the idiosyncratic style, dated approach, and nonstandard coverage, I wouldn't try using this as a main text."
5,Nice early stuff...,"You may not want to trust this review. I am a very biased Bil Evans fan, and will pretty much say that it is all great. Well, because it is. This is no exception. If you are a Bill Evans collector, fan, follower, etc. - worth buying. If you are new to Bill Evans, first buy ""Explorations"" and ""Everybody Digs Bill Evans"". Then you will find that you want more, and this is another good one. Or, if you really want to trust me about Bill Evans, I have very simple advice; Put every Bill Evans album that you can find on Amazon that was recorded prior to 1965 in your shopping cart and buy them all."
5,brake contoller,works great. Does what it is suppose to do. Use with handy prewired kit and mounting will be the only hurdle.
1,Junk I Rate this as a ZERO,"This unit was installed in a Chev Silerado as per instructions with a plug wiring harness. It does not provide enough braking power for a twin brake axel trailer. When I buy a product I expect it to work as advertized, this unit was junk. If you are going to make a product do it right or get out bussiness. I replaced this unit with another brand. I will never buy another product from Hopkins."
5,Works great for me,"I pull an 18 foot all steel car hauler with brakes on both axles, hauling a lot of scrap iron and steel and I've had the Hopkins 235 controller on my 99 Suburban for several years now and it works great."
5,Perfect & excelent bussinesss and comunication and very quickly the time to delivered; i'm very glad with my product is perfect,"excelent and pergectly bussinesss and comunication, very quickly at time to delivered; i'm very glad with my product is perfect and durabilty from my job."
3,"Looks good, toasts slow","I purchased this toaster to use at the office for toasting my breakfast bagel. My biggest gripe is that it takes about 4-5 minutes to toast a bagel to golden brown. Also, when the heating stops, the bagel doesn't always pop up automatically.The bagel feature works by pressing a button after you have started the heating process. This turns off the outside elements, so you can get the inside of the bagel brown without burning the outside. I tend to use this near the end of the cycle, otherwise the outside of the bagel won't be crisp.The style of 2035W is attractive and the price is fair, but I wish it worked faster."
1,Very displeased,"I was going for low price, so it is my own fault. This toaster toasts unevenly, won't toast well after the first two pieces once it gets hot, and the toast doesn't stay down when the lever is pushed. I am very unhappy with my purchase."
1,I am so sorry I bought this,"This is an absolutely horrible toaster. Toasting anything takes multiple cycles, even at the darkest setting. Many pieces of bread have gotten stuck inside. The Pop-Tart setting is useless. After several weeks of use, the ""cancel"" button (which is supposed to let you pop the toast up manually) stopped working all together.Do yourself a favor and don't go cheap buying a toaster. This one is just a complete waste of time and money. To paraphrase the Comic Book Guy:Worst. Toaster. Ever."
3,"great artists, but...","There is lovely singing here, and Gerald Moore is wonderful. But it's hard for me to appreciate a CD that is so ""live"". You spend much of the time listening to applause; for at least one of the duets, you can't even hear most of the singing, because the audience keeps laughing and applauding. The audience is clearly having a great time, but I'd rather just be able to listen to music."
5,Worth getting up early to listen to,"I'm not a morning person but this album could change my mind. I love the combination of growls (understandable ones at that) and clean vocals. Really great music, has remained in my most frequent play list since getting it."
4,nice!!!,"Ok, these guys are super melodic and heavy. Their two guitarists both sing, one clean, and the other growls!!! What's up with that? It's the perfect combo.but it can get a little boring, considering that it's all mid-tempo. You know, the perfect thing to listen to before sleep. However, don't get me wrong, you can also throw these guys in your cd playing when you want to flip out or something too.If you like In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, with a touch of Lincoln Park, or just plain melodic or goth metal, then this is the cd for you. Also check out ""My Darkness"". That cd is goes hand in hand with ""4:17am""."
2,Anybody going up?,"Because I love the compositions of curmudgeon Alec Wilder I pretty buy up whatever I can find,after all not much is available. There is a vocal album by Eileen Farrill. She has an operatic , strong voice but swings not. In any case the kindly faced ms. Robinson should confine her singing [2 vocals] to the shower only. I thought that she had some connection to pianist Marian Mcpartland but this album has about 20 seconds of piano. I hate to say it but Ms. Robinson appears to own a recording lab with multi-tracking and a drum machine and lots of synthesizers. Unfortuneatly this is Muzak, not even easy listeningI am old and remember elevator drivers, this isn't even good elevator stuff."
3,OK for kids,"The radio reception was great, although the sound quality was tinny and the analog tuner can be hard to use sometimes. As for the mirror, it was usable after an initial wipe, but it was too small. Overall, the design of this radio suggests that it's aimed more for kids than for adults."
5,Horse-opoly,"This was the hit of Christmas for our great niece, 9 years old. The whole family played for hours and had a great time. It's perfect for the horse lover, don't hesitate to get this."
3,Not checking,"Well, first off the pieces shown on the listing are pewter or something of that nature. When the game came all the pieces were cheap wood. I ordered the first game and it came missing the hay bales and barns pieces. I was nicely refunded my money to purchase a second game. Once I got the second game it was missing the horse playing cards. Someone at the filling stations are not checking the pieces to the game. Luckily I had not sent back the first game yet and was able to recover all the playing pieces. Overall the game was really great and my daughter loves it. But it took too many times to get all the pieces to play the game."
4,A fun version of monopoly for horse lovers,"If your (grand)children love horses, this is a game of monopoly that will hold their interest and teach them principles of money, finance and debt similar to the traditional monopoly game. The only shortcoming is a lack of ""bales of hay"" for your farms, but the manufacturer will happily send more on request at their expense. We had hours of fun playing during the recent holidays."
4,Great gift for horse lovers,"This was my one of my 8 yr old daughter's ""Santa"" gifts and she loves it. It is helping her learn how to handle money and how to handle small set backs, i.e., she hates being sent to the ""trailer"" (jail) but is learning to deal with it. Highly recommended board game!"
5,Horse-Opoly,"My 7-year-old Granddaughter loves horses. While playing Horse-Opoly, she had to add the numbers on the dice, count the right number of spaces, read the directions on cards drawn, and count money. Some of it was a bit challenging for her, but because it was all about horses, it held her attention for several hours."
4,cute,"I bought these on a whim for a friend who has those two kinds of dogs, but I've saving them for a fall gift. They are cute."
1,Not much for the money,This doc provides some basic metrics on article creation productivity and types of KBs used from small scale surveys. It also provides some basic statements about resolution rates but no real info that can help manage a KB. I did not find this little letter useful. These Soft Letters need some fiber.
1,Review of Beatles: Classic '65 DVD,"The DVD started playing fine, but after the first minute or so it started to freexe in spots, and then froze permanently. I tried re-playing it over and over, etc., but it wouldn't play. Pretty much a waste of my money (unless my player is extra sensitive)."
2,Only for Completists,"Completist: noun: An obsessive, typically indiscriminate, collector or fan of something.You would have to be pretty indiscriminate to enjoy this."
5,Beatles 1965 Lives!,"1965 was a banner year in Beatles' history. The Beatles were musically fertile and released several albums in 1965 alone. Their concert schedule was equally fast paced and viewers are treated to their television specials as well. In the spring of 1965, the Beatles guested on ""Shindig!"" and Paul tore the place up with ""Kansas City.""The Fabs then toured Europe as well as America. They had not only re-conquered the world, but they lay a musical claim that can never be taken. The footage is clean and clear as is the audio. This is a must have for Beatle fans."
1,Poor customer service,"The reason I purchased this product over other much faster machines was mainly the portability option. I wanted to play CDs on the go. Sony includes a remote with the drive that allows you to play CDs, but without the remote, you cannot use the drive as a portable CD player.I have had the unit one week, and my remote has already stopped working after one use. I have coddled this machine -- the problem is not a result of user damage. I called Sony, and they said I can either purchase a new remote or return the unit to the dealer. Why should I have to purchase a new part when the product is brand new? I will be returning this flimsy drive with its shoddy remote, and I will take my money elsewhere."
1,Wildly Inconsistent,"I think I would've been happier with an uglier, cheaper CD burner. I've coastered three disks for every one I've recorded. The software is useless -- it hangs precisely 47 seconds into testing. To get the included software to work properly, I've had to uninstall and reinstall each time. So now I'm using MusicMatch. Sony's support,while pleasant, was also useless. They repaired problems with a grinding noise and the eject button, but couldn't help me with the stalling problem. In fact, I had better luck when I did exactly opposite what they told me!"
1,Poor software!!,"Dont buy unless you are running win98SE. Manufacturer indicates W2K support but it does not run with anything but w98SE as you soon find out on SONY web site. ""Box information was in error..."""
4,Great CD-RW Drive but.....,"This CD-RW Drive is slim and lightweight, it feel fragile, good battery life, easy setup, in few minutes no more than 5 you are ready to transfer your files to a CD. But the drawbacks are the very poor software Sony include with the CD-RW, only two are compatible with Windows 98 first edition and no compatible with Apple Powerbook. The look and the portabitlity is great, as a portable CD player. But as a CD-RW to storaga data and transfer files between computers are no so great because software and hardware (with Apple) incompatibility."
5,Mac User?,"Well if you're a Mac user, and confined to a USB port, this is the CD burner for you. Using iTunes and OS 10.1, I have burned over 40 CDs without coastering one. I've been very happy with it, and it is as fast as you can get with an USB plug.The included software didn't run under os 10, and when I installed it under os 9.2.1, it didn't work very well. But its unnecessary anyways. Using iTunes, or the built in burn feature in 10.1 negates the need for the included software.The mp3 player works quite well also. I've been happy with it, and haven't had any problems with the remote either.Solid product from a reputable company."
1,I hate that cd!,"I thought I was gonna hear the original versions of those songs, because I haven't found them anywhere, but I don't like the sound. I really LOVE their 80's sound."
1,I'm in the mood for killing myself !!!,"This is NOT a original recording. True, it's done by real Nolans but in 1995? I didn't expect to listen 'I'm in the mood' by 40-or-something-year-old Nolans and how about those cheap computer generated background music? AHHHHH...The other Sony labeled 'Best Of' without 'very' should be genuine."
4,Close to the original,"I bought a pair of these because I wanted to have a set of gloves with removable liners. I had a pair of real surplus leather gloves which lasted a long time before they wore out. The pair I received is not quite like the picture. Oddly, the strap to tighten the gloves is up too high on the gloves, closer to the back of my hand then my wrist. While these are in the ""style"" of military gloves, the leather is not as thick as my original. That may appeal to some people as these are more supple. Would I buy again? Yes, only if I could not find them elsewhere."
3,Not the same as GI,"""Fat Fingers"". Tough to pick up tools. Doesn't have the slim lines of my Light duty cowhide from the Illinois Glove Company; GI. Wrist strap loosens easily, making for cold wrists, overall disappointed. Best use is for dress gloves."
4,Shocklingly decent,"I was pleasantly surprised of the quality of these gloves given the price. The pull straps did fray a little bit where they attach to the seem along the edge of the palm, but I just sewed them myself. I was worried they might break.Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the leather material itself."
2,water bottle,not good for aquarium everytime a hamster hits the bottle it makes a noise against the glass keeps moving around
4,Weird Attachment: Good Bottle Design,"This product is very good, with the exception of the attachment. To put it on the side of the cage you have to use this wire...it's kind of dinky. But the price is fairly good for the sturdiness of the bottle. the double-ball valve is fantastic and dripping is at a bare minimum. I have had bottles that my hamster chewed open. I'm pretty sure she'll have a hell of a time trying to chew this one ;)"
3,Works well but not fantastically,"In my area the only water bottles I can find are for cage mounts, not aquarium mounts. I have a Guinea Pig that originally had a huge cage but he kept scattering litter, so he was moved to a large clear rubber tote, which works better than an aquarium. I had to way to hang his bottle, so he would squeak when thirsty. And we held the bottle for him. I ordered this bottle because of the low price and assuming it would hang well by the other review.Basically this is a little bottle with a little loop on the top which a wire is attatched. It can easily be replaced by a paper clip. You can re-adjust the wire depending on the height of your pet and cage. My pig adjusted easily to the new downward spout as opposed to an angled one. I just hope it stays on. For a pet who likes to play with their bottle, it could be a problem."
2,Flawed DVDs From History Channel,"Several of the chapters on the DVD are missing the first several minutes, which included the introduction and origin of the martial arts (Silat, Ninjitsu, Savate). These chapters started with Chambers and Duff in the dojo practicing, but the missing parts left the viewers wondering what is the name of the dojo, who is the master teaching them, what is the master's background and what was the origin of the martial arts. It would have been a very good documentary DVD, if they included the beginning/missing parts."
3,A good overview of several different martial arts,"Having just recently started training in the martial arts, I was very eager to learn more about all the popular styles. This is a good overview of all the ones you've heard of, and a few you probably haven't. It certainly doesn't cover every style; it would be virtually impossible to do so.While each show culminates in a fight, most of the time is spent showing the training. You're not likely to learn more than one or two techniques, but it's good to see the differences between the systems."
5,Martial Arts with Travel,I enjoy watching the tv series that is why i bought the season of human weapon.
5,brilliant,amazing dvd covers various fighting styles and what happens in the body whilst excuting moves great to watch
5,If Love Can Speak,"""If Love Can Speak"" is an extraordinary book! At first I was attracted to the cover, but after reading it, the poetry did its justice. It is a wonderful combination of classic/modern poems, which is extremely rare in today's society. The beat of these poems can sing a song! I truly recommend this book! Even if poetry isn't your thing, this book will change your mind."
4,Smaller than it looks,"I got this as a gift for my Grandmother. She likes it very much as the mother of pearl goes with lots of colors. When it arrived, it was a bit smaller than it looks in the picture, but pretty none the less."
2,Not totally washable,"These markers are not as washable as I hoped they would be. They have left slight marks on my kitchen table after my son colored there. Everything else wipes right off of the table, but not these. I would recommend Crayola!"
2,"This is not a ""Martian Popping Thing!""","I grew up with this toy and like to share it with children of all ages. They are sometimes hard to find. I ordered two of them from this company and they are not only NOT called ""Martian Popping Thing"" anymore, but they are made so cheaply that they are harder to squeeze and the nose doesn't pop like it's supposed to. Although I would love to recommend this toy to all of my friends and family, I would warn them off of this one."
5,Good quality and useful for the winter and cold summer nights,Looks great and is useful piece of kit to have when out and about in the summer or winter.
5,Excellent,This burner has good heat control. I use it for low temperature cooking as an adjunct to my gas range...it provides fine control for this purpose. Seems well-built with a true thermostat. Nicely done.The Amazon price was the best at the time I write...many places charge as much as ten dollars more.
4,Great hot plate...utnil it died!,"This is a great hot plate for a bachelor pad or if you live somewhere without a kitchen, like me! The plate size is a little big larger than most hot plates. For a hot plate, it heats up fairly quickly. The only drawback is that the surface has little ridges running from the center to the edge so if something gets spilled on the plate it's hard to clean.This is an update six months later:This little hot plate gave us many dinners until it died a couple of weeks ago. We had the hot plate for about six months and then it kicked the bucket. So sad. I wouldn't recommend this hot plate to anybody who will use it on a daily basis. It might be good for casual use."
2,disappointed,I purchased this item because I have a glass cooktop stove. I am growing a garden and wanted to can. Found this item on a website that said it was perfect for using with a canner. This item does not keep water boiling in a water bath. My tomatoes did not seal because of this. Very disappointed. Would not recommend to anyone.
1,Took forever to boil water - then it died.,"When this was working, it took a really, really long time to bring water to a boil. I just tried using it today, and it stopped working altogether. Now I am in the market for a different brand."
1,don't waste your money on this one,"You'd think we'd have learned our lesson after our first Toastmaster 6431 Eclipse single burner died after two days. But no, we exchanged it for a second, which died in a day. And then a third (two days). We thought we'd just hit a defective batch, and when hotplate number 4 arrived, and kept working, we were relieved.It worked for 2 months. And then, like the others, inexplicably died. Our electrician friend thinks maybe there is a big problem with..fuses melting? or something. Anyway, he said it is a dangerous item.We are now searching for really good hotplate that will last. Our previous one lasted 15 years. Not bad. No longer made though.Don't bother with this one, and I'd be pretty skeptical of any of the Toastmaster line myself"
5,a great single burner,"I use this with a pressure cooker, regularly crank it all the way to 6, and it's still giving great service after several months of regular use. Beats hands down the coil type electric eyes."
3,bad temperature controller,"I'm currently having the same problem with the temperature control being stuck/not working. At first, it was just hard to turn, but now it will NOT turn off, and is permanently stuck at ""level 4"" heat and will not go any lower (if I push hard, it'll go higher, and I can push it back to level 4, but that's it.), so the only way I can turn it off is by unplugging it while it's still hot, which is very scary, and thus I have stopped using it after I saw sparks fly the last time I tried to unplug it :/ (and after reading other reviews about the fuse breaking, I'm especially glad I stopped using it)Anyhow, I WILL say that it worked perfectly fine for at least a year or two, and I only paid about $30-40 or so for it, so I guess for the price, I got as much as I should have expected."
4,Nice for a dorm,"My roommate and I have had this burner for about a month, and we love it. It's a great item to add to our dorm contraband, since technically, we probably are not supposed to have it here. It cooks well, even though as someone else pointed out, it takes a while to heat up. It also has a funny smell sometimes, but that might be normal. It's a great size and fits really well under my bed. I consider it a necessity for my life, because one simply cannot live on college food! In fact, we call one of our dining options, Buckeye Express, ""Buck Yuck"". It's great to be able to have more food options, as well as healthier food options."
1,Only lasted 3 months,"I used it on a daily basis for 3 months then it stopped working. For several weeks before it stopped working, it made a popping noise, and would rattle the pot until it got up to full heat. It didn't have the capacity to get hot enough to make popcorn, but its was good for boiling eggs, veggies, and frying. My next purchase is going to be a regular hot plate"
1,Toastmaster 6431 Eclipse Single Burner is poor,Do not buy this product. The one I got was used three times and it quit.
1,Waste of money.....,"This single burner lasted almost 8 weeks until it completely stopped working. It took a long, long time to heat up and I wished I had returned it after using it only a week. Don't bother."
2,"poor quality, danger of shock or electrical fire","The Toastmaster 6431 does not have an Underwriters Lab label, which would make anyone hesitate before buying it. The Underwriters Lab endorsement (a ""UL"" logo) indicates that the electrical product is properly designed and constructed so that it is safe. We found the product online, where there was no info about the UL status of the product.The first thing that broke was the temperature control. We fixed that by oiling the screw whose in-out motion controls the heat setting.The more serious problems emerged when the fuse blew. We looked inside and discovered overheated wires with partially-melted insulation. This condition could cause both an electrical shock to the user and an electrical fire that could burn down a house.Toastmaster makes another hot plate (model TTS1) which does have an Underwriters Lab endorsement. We bought one today, and we hope that it will work safely until after the end of our kitchen remodelling project."
1,Foul Smell,"I've had this burner for two months, now. The smell it emits is really bothersome. It's sort of a burning chemical smell. It really never got better with use, although it got a little bit better. But it is still a strong smell which is unacceptable.The burner takes a long time to heat up. It takes about twenty minutes just to boil water in a 3 qt. saucepan.On the plus side, it is a good looking burner. The new rubber top with concentric rings is something I've never seen before. Cleanup is easy.If I could do it all over again, I would never buy this. I thought I was buying one of those solid cooktops that is metallic. Instead, there is this rubber type surface which emits a chemical smell on every use."
1,NO!,"Don't buy it! Looks great and is easy to clean, but quits for no apparent reason. I returned the first one after it quit on week three, and the second one quit tonight after two weeks. My last ... hot plate lasted three years! Also, this one seemed to get extremely hot on it's outer counter. Something is wrong with these - don't risk it.. We only use it for making tea. It should not perform so badly. Looks great -is not worth the extra price."
1,Quit working after 6 months,"I used this stove to boil water about 100 times in six months. Recently it quit working in the middle of cooking dinner. I replaced a fuse inside the stove which had burnt out but the new fuse burnt out in the middle of the next meal. I searched extensively for a short circuit inside and could find none so I removed the fuse altogether and replaced it with 14 gauge wire -- solder melted during next use. I've resoldered the connection and watched it closely tonight, it appears to get stuck in the on position until it heats up enough to short out. I'd say this product has a design flaw and may possibly be dangerous."
5,Dorm lockbox,"Perfect for dorm dresser drawers - screw it into one of the drawers. Big enough for jewelery, cash, wallet, credit cards, car keys, ADD medicines (big target for college thievery)."
2,CD,Thought there was very little taught on this Cd for the money. really only one technique bridging peices for easier placement.Think it neededinstructions in book form.
1,get something better,"I purchased this toaster, because I wanted something cheap and affordable. I am going to buy something more expensive that actually works. The Toastmaster only browns on one side and leaves the other side completely untoasted. The crumb collector (that thing at the bottom of the toaster that collects all the crumbs--I forget the real name of it) doesn't work very well. I have crumbs all over my counter all the time.So, maybe someone less fortunate than myself will find this toaster useful, as I am giving it away to goodwill."
2,"Okay for your 1st toaster, but your $ could be better spent","We registered for this for our wedding, and after about 5 months of use, we realized we needed to upgrade. If you want a toaster for your first apartment and can't afford anything else, then this will do. It does the job. It always toasted both sides of my toast. If you can spare even $30, you can get a MUCH better toaster.My biggest complaint is that this does not collect crumbs at all. I am constantly cleaning crumbs off my counter. I upgraded to a 4-slice model for around $30, and I haven't seen a crumb in months.Also, the handle was sticky and sometimes you can't get it to stay down well.This is going to the Salvation Army. Hope you get a better one if you are in the market for a new toaster."
1,flaming toast,"This toaster is a hazardous inconvenience. The toaster burned the toast so severely that there were actually flames coming out of the toaster. Thinking that the bread I sliced was too thin, I cut a thicker piece and tried again. This time, one side of the toast was completely burned, with flames coming out of the toaster once again, while the other side of the toast was not toasted at all. I returned this toaster immediately. I recommend that you don't buy this toaster, unless you love having extremely burnt toast, and enjoy small appliances starting on fire with the large risk of your house erupting into flames."
1,If I could give this zero stars I would!,I have one question: Did the people at Toastmaster ever bother to even test this product before they put it on the market?I didn't want to buy an expensive $75 toaster and didn't want that four slice kind that takes up half your countertop so I thought this would do. It has NEVER worked since it came out of the box. A quick look inside will tell you why it doesn't toast evenly. One side has several heating coils and the other has 3 ! DUH! The crumb tray is worthless and the spring action is defective. This was $12 thrown away. Buy a better model.
1,toasts one side at a time,"not only does it only toast one side, it takes several attempts to make the bread stay down to be toasted. The blue flash at eash attempt is not some thing I care to see in an electrical appliance. The plastic case does stay cool, but as a toaster, it isn't much."
1,The Toastburner 2000,"It is rare to see a product backed by a name like Toastmaster that performs its basic, core function -- making toast -- so poorly. Even an English Muffin will slip through to the bottom of the toaster, creating a 15 minute ""recovery"" job since it has no sliding crumb tray.When your item doesn't fall to the bottom of the toaster, it will burn on one side while not cooking at all on the other. Sometimes, if you're lucky, the machine will moderately warm your bread so that after two or three rounds of toasting, and you'll have something resembling toast.This item works fairly better with simple, sliced white bread. Try other shapes or bread densities at your own peril. All in all, you're better off without a toaster. Don't buy this one."
4,Good design,"This went on quite easy, all you need is a slotted screwdriver. Good design. six more words are required here."
1,burnt out after two months,This light bulb burned out after two months. This is the only light in our kitchen and it was frustrating to have it burn out and need to replace it so quickly.
1,Somethings Can't Be Reviewed Quickly,It's a light bulb. It worked when I installed it. Reviewed so Amazon will stop hounding me for a review.If it lasts 3 years it's a five star. If it lasts 2 years it's a three star. If it lasts less than that it's a one star. TBD.I've said the same thing on three other reviews of light bulbs.UPDATE: The bulb burned out after two months of use. I've contacted the seller and will let you know how I'm treated. For now I can give this only one star.
1,"Cheaply made, breaks at the slightest pressure","I broke two of these flimsy light bulbs while installing them. They are full of toxic mercury so its poisonous when they break. Avoid this design if possible and opt for the the good old fashioned screw-in bulbs that actually work. The pressure from the holding clips should not break the glass, its just a poor design."
5,For a desk lamp,"Got this for a drafting flex type lamp for my wife. She uses it all the time. How much can be said about a light bulb? You will find the major portion of my reviews rate the product high. We don't have much money, so I spend a lot of time researching a reviewing articles before purchasing, so far this has worked and we have been very happy with 99% of our purchases."
5,GREAT ITEM FOR THE PRICE TERRIFIC COMPANY,I must say this company sells a high grade product and their delivery time was faster than the speed of lightning. The price was terrific too after checking other sites they had the cheapest with reasonable shipping and handling.
2,bad bulb,"may have been a bad lot, but bulb did not work. flickered and then, all was darkamazon refunded -amazon prime"
1,"I received a bad bulb, contacted the seller who promise to send me another bulb, which never happen. Buyer beware","I received a bad bulb, the bulb the seller send to me looks new but has three rings running around inside it and it does not work. I contacted the seller who promised to send me another bulb, which never happened. Buyers beware, this seller is a scam, buy at your own risk. I lost money in this transaction, bad, bad, bad transaction."
4,works great with an aftermarket MGB battery box,"If the battery shelf on your MGB is going out, get a plastic box from Moss or wherever, then get one of these to hold it down - works great. Also don't forget an acid-protecting mat, and maybe a disconnect switch if you're an infrequent driver."
2,kdhj3,why sell product individually. do you sell only left or right shoe. no you sell them as a pair. other than that product ok.
1,Great if you lost your sleeping pills,"I had to read this for a class and review it and all I can say is it is super boring. Not saying I don't like history and there are many other scholarly books that are interesting but the way this book is written it is so dry and confusing that it made it all the harder to read the book and complete the assignment. The book could of been tl;dr'ed: ""Chinese people are unorganized so Sun Yat-sen then Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT tried to do just that with crack-downs and the Communists used this as an example of the oppressive nature of the KMT (kind of ironic really).""This would be good for someone who is studying this particular period of time, but if they are they are probably boring people.It truly says something when you try to sell the book back to Amazon and they won't even accept it. Because nobody wants it!"
4,Boy's like it,My 5 year old brother likes this. It's a good video has a lot of accidents like little tid-bits from races. Some of it looks like it would hurt. But like I said the kid likes it. I think men would too. It was a good buy for the $$.
1,Bland Boring Posers,"I can't for the life of me understand how anybody could find this CD worthwhile. The songs are bland and homogenized and never create a spark or intensity. This emotionless set of tunes never goes anywhere. This band suffers from the same malady of many of today's supposed blues bands...they don't know when to cut their losses and end a song that had no real direction in the first place. However, if you have a choice between buying this CD and seeing this band live, buy the CD. Tom Healey is even more boring and bland live. At least on the CD, you don't have to watch him go through his best ""emotional artist poses"" or listen to his inane mumbling patter between and during every song. Albany does have some good blues artists in town but this guy isn't one of them."
1,"Reference only, no good for learning","This book is too broad and shallow. Can hardly find a complete and useful program. Seem like it tries to cover everything but nothing covered in detail. Connecting to Excel and words is also just connection only. After connecting, then what to do?? The author said go and read other books if you want to know in depth. If you want to see a lot of API or commands, this book is for you. No good for learning something useful and practical."
3,But the color?,"After reading reviews for this camera, I decided it would be a good investment. However, I was quite disappointed when I got the camera home and began taking pictures. Perhaps my camera is just faulty, but none of the pictures came out with good color. Other than that, the camera is good. It is easy to use and doesn't take long to get started. However, I am considering taking the camera back."
3,slow and mediocre picture quality,"This camera should be considerably better than the entry level fixed focus Olympus D-360L of a few years ago. However, I found the picture quality markedly worse than the less expensive 360L. Images were not sharp. Also the delay between hitting the shutter and getting the shot was considerably longer than that of the 360L. Colors seemed off to me, and the LCD would jump erratically in how it was balancing colors as I balanced the picture. Mostly it is the picture quality I find disturbing. I thought my camera was defective and picked up another, but obtained the same results."
1,Poor focus & Color,"Have been using for about a month. Camera is easy to use & batteries are lasting a long time. Auto-focus seems to be a bit off. Many of my photos are not completely focused. Color is very bad & varies. I can take two shots back to back, and the colors are wildly different from the first shot to the second. I'm planning on returning it."
5,Optical viewfinders on Olympus Brio digicams,"I wish to dispell a misunderstanding that may be caused by the review of the Brio D-100 by 'rheumor' below. All Olympus Brio cameras currently available feature optical viewfinders, in addition to LCD monitors. These optical viewfinders use a lens that is separate from the lens used to take the picture; thus, some parallax is unavoidable. When doing close-ups or other critical work, the user should employ the [built-in] LCD monitor for image composition."
1,Maybe I got a defective one,"I got the Brio D-150 because I really like my old Olympus D-320L, but wanted a newer camera with more memory and easier uploading (USB instead of serial). Unfortunately, the picture quality is terrible. Worst is the color balance: indoors, on Auto, everything is yellow. When I set it to tungsten (light bulb), everything is blue. The auto-focus seems to be off, too--pictures are all slightly blurred. Bluntly, the pictures are ugly. My old Olympus takes much better pictures, as does my wife's newer (and cheaper) HP315.From all the good reviews that I've seen for this camera, I suspect that I just got a faulty one, but it's not worth my time to try another of the same model. I'm returning this camera and not getting another Olympus any time soon. I recommend that, if you buy this camera, get it from somewhere with a good return policy, in case mine is not an isolated case."
1,get what you pay for,"Waste of money. Didn't last a week, delaminated and failed. snaps failed. Better off going to a western clothing store."
2,Nice product if I ever receive it,Product was ordered on 5th of December and never had shipped until the 16th. Sure hope it makes it before Christmas.Would have been nice to know from the distributor that the product would not ship for 2 weeks.
4,A Death Wish on DVD,"I like most bikers like to think they ride quick. The first time I saw this film I just sat for 40 mins with my jaw hanging open! Its really scary! Just watch it and you'll see what I'm getting at! Wide open at 299 kph, (they're in Sweden OK) blasting through traffic. The whole time I'm thinking, this can't last long but it does."
3,For those who like shootouts...,"If you are a fan of Alyssa Milano and expect to see her, you will be greatly disapointed. She is on screen for no more than 90 seconds and has about five lines. If you are fan of 1920's and 1930's tales of gangsters, bank robers and the FBI then it may be worth your while. Theresa Russell offers a good performance as the mother and ring leader of a pack of fast shooting and fast living bank robers. Based on a true story of a mid-western family set out to get rich quick at any cost that lands them on the FBI's most wanted list. Also featuring Dan Cortese and Eric Roberts, whose performances add a bit of drama to a fast moving tale. Good for those who like old fashioned ganster action, otherwise the film is quite liner with a one track focus."
1,Worst copy ever!,"This is a really good and entertaining movie if you like thriller, action, and suspense; but this is a very bad copy. The worst I've every seen(that's the problem-i can't see the movie). First and last time buying from amazon."
1,wrong movie,"Be careful if you order this movie. I ordered it thinking I would get the movie pictured, with Theresa Russell, Alyssa Milano, and Eric Roberts. I did not. I got a movie with Johnny Depp. There are two movies with the same name. If you order this, there's no telling which version you'll end up with. I gave this one star because I got the wrong movie."
1,Aptly named title,"This movie is definately a ""public enemy"" and is one of the most shoddy productions possible. I am an Eric Roberts fan, but this poor effort is not to be believed! Low budget, poor acting, total lack of a script, and non-sensical scenes combine for a major disaster....BEWARE!!"
5,Great cover,Purchased this for my husband's truck - he is extremely pleased with it and it is a perfect fit.
2,not helpful,"the twisted metal:black srategy guide is not a very helpful book if u ask me. when u read to find out where secrets r, yeah they tell u but it dont make sence. the only thing i used the book for was to find the hidden characters, i pretty much found axel, and manslaughter on my own, but the rest i used the book. the book even says that minion has secrets, but its a strategy guide they should at least ell u how to find them!"
1,Ouch,WOW ! That is one great price for one gallon ! does it come with a stainer and lifetime guarantee !
4,Visual Introduction to E. M. Forster,This fairly small book is a gem for every Forster fan. Not only does it present a succint but complete biography of this great British writer but illustrates it with numerous pictures (photographs mainly but also drawings and paintings) of himself and his friends and relatives.If you are a Forster fan this is a good place to start your adventure with his biographies but it will certainly only make your crave for more and here is when larger and more detailed works of Furbank and Beauman will come handy.
3,Ninjutsu training,"This book spends much of the time with an interview of the Grandmaster Masaaki Hatsumi. There are a few snap shots of some ninjustu training, but nothing worth talking about. I would only recommend this book to add to your already existing collection of ninja books and not be the only one. If you are into obtaining knowledge of ninjustu I would buy Stephen Hayes books on the subject over Hatsumis'. With Hatsumis books you will get history and tradition of the art, but with Hayes books you will get that plus much of the actual applications of the training and techniques."
1,"Whats Japanese for ""Crap!""?",Hatsumi is right up there with scientology. Complete fabrication that people can't wait to pay for. Not one useful piece of information is this book.
1,Grand Master in Theatrical Arts,"Maasaki Hatsumi a recognized Grand Master in Teathrical Arts , a poet , a caligraph , a japanesse , a oriental philosophies expert a encouraged friend of PsyilliRabbit of the DragonElite the Top World Martial Arts club recognized in yahoo about American SERIOUS Karata expert in make reviews of books of Martial Arts and relateds topicsWell they too deserve as friends ecourageds to make reviews and increase the data base of cultural knowledge of martial arts for the general public that the Maasaki Hatsumi book a true friend of DragonElite the Grand Asster Ed Martin and psyillirabbit the Great Master Maasaki Hatsumi deserve that your book be reviewedunfortunely this book not deserve more that the sugested 1 STAR unfortunely i need agree with PsyilliRabbit Ed Martin friend"
4,in depth,"This is one of my first books on the subject.A great book,I'm now reading for the third time.Some of the answers to the questions he's askedare blurry at first glance,but after reading another time or twoall I can say is it's amazing if you can interperet themcorrectly."
1,Not what you think?,"The listing for the bulb(s) says Package Quantity 12. I received one single bulb, at a pretty steep price for this one bulb. Certainly didn't save anywhere near $59.00 as advertised."
1,rip off,I only received one bulb and the listing stated I would receive 12. Where are the other 11 bulbs? I found a single bulb online elsewhere for only $3.49 so this is not a 90% savings.
2,Bali Hoop Earrings,"I was really looking forward to receiving these earrings, but was very disappointed when I received them. Although they were pretty to look at, functionally they were useless. The sterling silver they are made from seems very flimsy and they have NO latch on them, which means you have to force them open to try to get them on. I had to return them because I was worried I would break them trying to put them on. It's a shame, because they looked so nice. One earring was also slightly larger than the other."
1,This product does not work,This lipstick does not work. I shined light to it for 5 minutes to activate it just like it said and then I went in the dark and nothing happened. It didn't glow at all. The lipstick glowed in the container but not on my lips. I would not recommend this product brcause it did not work.
5,SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS' BEST BUY!,"Marcia Yudkin doesn't hold back: she generously shares her expertise in this practical guide to self publicity, and as the president of a young consulting practice, I can't recommend this book often or loud enough! Don't know how to write (or use) a press release? Wondering how to communicate effectively with the media? Always wanted to write articles for magazines and newspapers, but haven't a clue where to begin? Read this book: Marcia Yudkin walks you through the critical steps of garnering publicity for your business, in clear, crisp and often hilarious prose. What a treasure of terrific advice!"
4,Smart Marketers Will Listen to Marcia Yudkin,"Coming into a newly-created marketing position for a professional association, I have next to no budget and no support from the so-called communications staff. I've known Marcia Yudkin from her ""Marketing Minute"" e-mail and the Click-Z forum and knew I better get her ""6 Steps to Free Publicity."" Yudkin is marvellous at highlighting how publicity can go the extra mile where marketing dollars can't. She's even better at inspiring the reader with great ideas. I'm using the tools I've learned from this book to not only market my association and products, but also passing along ideas and tips from the book to bolster the Communication Director's misguided efforts. Thanks Marcia!"
5,A worthwhile investment,"During my first year of business I purchased 6 Steps to Free Publicity by Marcia Yudkin. It was the best ten dollars I ever spent on a book. I followed Marcia's advice step by step -- offered to speak to any group that would have me, taught continuing education classes and got several newspapers to write a story about my career counseling business. Just as Marcia promised, one story led to another and before long I was getting more publicity than I ever thought possible. Thanks to Marcia I have not spent a dime on advertising during the past two years, yet my business continues to grow and prosper."
5,"A novel of faith, struggle, destiny, and the human heart.","Set amidst the brutal reign of Nicolae Ceausescu in 1980s Bucharest, Rumania, Sylvia Bambola's Refiner's Fire is the gripping story of secrets, suspense, persecution, and faith. Alexander Wainwright is the ambitious new American ambassador to Romania. Yuri Deyneko is the Romanian army officer (and clandestine Christian) assigned to spy on him.

1,"work's great ""but""","We've only used it 2x for fish sticks & fish fillets. The fish sticks were crispy & hot to the center ""perfect"" The fillets of fish also were cooked evenly hot & tender. The were only 2 problems with the oven that I found with the oven. It was damaged & the video was broken. When I received the package it was in perfect condition. I removed the first box & the original box was also fine. Being that it was a crhistmas gift I felt no reason to open the factory box. On Christmas morning my wife had opened it & found the video broken & I found that it was dented as it were dropped. The second dislike is the fan is very noisy. I feel that the qaulity of the design & manufacturing could improve & above all the shipping department. Where was qaulity control when this was item was repacked after being damaged."
1,Not worth the time or money,"Have used this a number of times and I'm very disappointed in this product. Smokes, makes a big mess and is very difficult to clean."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"It sounded like the perfect oven: good reviews, low cost, compact size, even heating with convection, and removable basket. I wanted it as a dedicated oven to bake my polymer clay sculptures. But alas! It has no temperature control! I sent it right back (without even trying it) using Amazon's excellent return procedure. I ended up buying a Cuisinart TOB-175BC instead."
1,DON'T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT,"ITS NOISY!!!!. OVEN MUST BE SECURED BEFORE YOU OPEN THE TRAY DOOR, IF NOT SECURED THE OVEN ENDS UP IN YOUR LAP. DOES NOT COOK IN ALLOTTED TIMES SPECIFIED IN COOKING DIRECTIONS. IF WORKING WITH BREAD CRUMB ITEMS, WHEN YOU OPEN TRAY DOOR YOUR COUNTER GETS MESSY WITH CRUMBS. WHEN COOKING STEAKS, BURGERS, ANYTHING THAT HAS A LOT OF FAT DRIPPINGS, SPLATTERS WILL OCCUR AND THE OVEN IS A PAIN TO CLEAN. AGAIN, WHEN YOU OPEN TRAY DOOR DRIPPINGS WILL GET ALL OVER COUNTER. IF YOU WANT THIS OVEN FOR PIZZA YOU WLL FIND THAT IT DOES NOT CRISP IN SETTING TIME. THE INFOCOMMERCIAL IS A LOT OF BULL. I HAD TO GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 1 STAR TO GET THIS REVIEW POSTED."
1,Bad policy for reordering,I ordered this item and then tried to cancel order so I couldorder two of them and they immediately told me I couldn'torder another of the same kind in the same order. I don'tappreciate this because I don't think this could have gone tothe shipping department that fast.
4,Great steaks!,"I saw this on TV and thought Amazon might have it, which they do.... So far, I have cooked many different things both frozen and regular. The food that comes out of here is great except one thing.. the frozen food takes longer to cook then the refrigerated items and you'll often have to re-cook it 5-10 more minutes depending on what it is. Sometimes, this is rare, but sometimes the outside got a little burnt because the inside was not cooked all the way but what can you do? You need cooked food! BUT I tell ya, T-bone steaks are soooooooo good in here!"
4,"Amazing speed...not such a ""cinch"" to clean though","I absolutely love this machine. I love coming home from work and having dinner ready (from frozen) in 15 mins or less. So far I have cooked everything in it from sirloin steak to hot pockets. It works great for everything! French fries come out crispy and hot dogs taste like they're right off the BBQ. My only grudge is the clean up. The slide out tray is not so bad to clean (and it's dishwasher safe), but the inside is a chore! You have to clean it when it's still a little warm so the stuff comes off, but you have to scrub near the heating elements so it's very hard! But overall, I would recommend it. It's affordable and handy, and it's only the size of a small microwave."
5,Toastmaster TUV48 Ultravection Oven,"I love this oven,have now had it for over 6 weeks,It works great on just about everything,have not found anything yet that I could not use it for. French Fries,frozen pizza,fish,crab cakes,Steaks(they stay extra juicy),tuna melts,breakfast sausage, pork tenderloin,chicken breast to name just a few of the things I have used it for.Easy to clean, basket and drip tray go right in dishwasher. My only complaint is exterior of unit gets very hot,could not use in enclosed space need at least 4-6 inches clearance all directions. But if you have the clearance I am sure you will not be disappointed with this unit."
1,Understand your requirements,"I feel that this is poorly designed in comparison to other Toastmaster convection ovens. It provides little temperature control. It is an open bottom oven. I am not sure what specifications Toastmaster was designing to; but, someone missed the boat. Please take note; this is according to my criteria. If I would have had more details on the product, I would never have ordered it."
3,didn't last long,"While it worked, it was the best device I've used for making quesadillas. I could cook them just long enough that they weren't burnt, but the oils of the cheese would seperate. I miss that flavor so much. Ovens burn them around the edges, microwaves just make them soggy.I used it for around 6 months, then one day it just stopped working. There was a burning plastic smell coming from it and it refused to heat anymore.It was also very difficult to keep clean, and very small inside. Would be a great product though, if the quality was higher."
4,Toastmaster TUV48 Ultravection Oven,It's a great product - but wish they would make it easier to clean.
3,some what OK,"I would like it better if I could dial in the temperature rather then just push the button for bake, it makes a lovely 1 layer cake however it does not do well in making a casserole. Also I do not like the ideal that the bottom is bottomless somewhat, had to put a tile square under it to be sure my counter did not get too hot.I thought I was getting an oven that I could bake in. The price seem to be about right. Thank you for allowing me to convey my ideals."
5,worth the money,"This is a great buy. I use it to cook all the frozen food in half of the time. The food come out better than the regualr oven. I havn't try to cook raw meet, so I don't know how it will handle it. For what I need, it worth every penny. If you like to prepare fast frozen meal, this is the way to go."
3,Ultravection oven by Toastmaster,"I bought one -- loved it!!! Amazon offers a very good deal as oppposed to infomercial price. However, a little over a year it began to ""misfire' - preheat would not work, then it would, thought the computerized buttons might be off. Finally it died altogether - no buttons would work, might beep if it felt like it but would not heat at all. While I loved the taste of the food it produced as well as the fast time, I feel the product should have a longer life than a little over a year. I don't think I'd buy again because of the lack of longevity, but while it worked it was wonderful - did everything it says it will."
2,Works well but doesn't hold up.,"I was initially very please with the product. I thought it worked well for the price. The problem is with the design and quality control. The black coating chips off the basket tray slides because its metal against metal. Also after 4 months of moderate use, a defect in the convection motor made a horrible knocking noise whenever used, and needed to be repaired. This would be a better product if it was more solidly built, and perhaps a bit more expensive."
4,Ignore the one star reviewers!,"This oven isnt perfect in design,but its really not too bad for a 50.00 or 60.00 oven. So if you are on a budget,go for it otherwise pay 150.00 or more for a Delonghi."
1,DO NOT BUY TOASTMASTER PRODUCTS,"I recently owned two Toastmaster products and both are now in the local landfill. One broke after 4 months, 4-slice toaster,and is not covered under any warranty. One of the darkness knobs popped out and the darkness is uncontrollable??? Toastmaster ignored all emails sent to them about this one.Their griddle product is horrible. After approxiamately 6 uses,the griddle began cooking uneven. They acknowledged one of my emails but never followed through. It tooks 60 days of my time for nothing.STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. THIER LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANTIES ARE JUST PROMISES."
2,Very smoky during cooking and IMPOSSIBL E TO CLEAN,"I bought this oven about two years ago, but I've only used it a handful of time because it is so difficult to clean. I also smokes up the kitchen and connecting rooms. While I love the way it cooks meats and salmon steaks -- quick and juicy -- I found the cleaning and smoking problems prohibitive."
4,"Excellent for the busy, single person","I have been very pleased with this purchase. I buy Tyson individually wrapped steaks to cook and they turn out great. Chicken and fish also turn out very delicious. I don't know about breaded foods because I don't eat them, but I am sure they would be good also. The only bad thing I have to say about the Ultravection is that it is kind of noisy (my drip pan rattles) and it is not exactly appealing to look at. Other than that, I think the purchase was worth it. (my thawed steaks take around ten minutes to cook (after 4 min preheat) and you don't have to watch them) You don't have to preheat frozen foods."
4,Toastmaster Ultravection Oven,"I really like this oven. It's very quick, and seals all the juices in the meat--frozen or nonfrozen. Good investment."
1,Hard to Clean,"The food from the oven tastes good but if you have a big hand like mine, it is very difficult to stick your hands in to clean the oven! In fact, I got so frustrated with cleaning, I stopped using it."
1,How to do EVERYTHING ? (!!!),"No my friends, this book is just blah, blah, blah, with just a few pictures. I ordered the book based on all the good reviews, but the book is AWFUL! There are better books on the market."
2,could be very bore,"Went I boutgh this book I thought that it could be very interesting, but it wasn't like that, went I started to read it I realize that this book is really bore because it has too much letters and I think that it could be very interesting and easy tolearn is this book has more graphics and pictures or Illustration....... That's why I think that this book could bevery bore..... Sorry about my english...."
2,How To Not Do Much With Flash 5,"It was very difficult to figure out how to do anything with this book. Open up any chapter and you'll find paragraph after paragraph of theories behind Flash and animation concepts. But if you want a step-by-step guide to learning flash, this book has none. It does not guide you through projects or even offer instruction on how to create simple sites. To find what you are looking for you need to read through endless garbage and explanations of general design concepts. And even then, you are not likely to read about the steps of creating a button. Aside from this, the website where the publisher promises ""Free images Online"" does not currently exist."
5,One of the Better Flash Books I've read!,I have the Visual Quick Start Guide and the Flash Bible. This book is much more comprehensive than the Visual Quick Start and has more useful information than the Flash Bible.I find myself using this book daily for questions I have on Flash. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a great reference and tutorial guide.
5,Like new.,I rec'd a mint condition book. I saw the author in person & she's learned her lessons well. tb
3,A Disappointment,"Wilhelm is one of those writers who gets overwhelmed by the publicity machines that promote Grisham, et. al. So she seems to have become Grishamesque in an effort to sell books. Too bad. I found this one tedious and overcomplicated with bad guys suddenly dropped in from nowhere. It also lacked the character development that has elevated her other books above run of the mill. I suspect the hand of an overeager editor and publisher because Wilhelm seems too intelligent to turn out this mish mash.And does anyone know what's become of John?"
3,Good but not enough for the long wait,"I was so excited to see the new Wilhelm book but a bit disappointed when I read it. The story itself was okay but I thought the editing was terrible and a couple of characters (eg Waters) seemed to appear as one person and then as another with little explanation about who/what they were all about. I'm also a little tired of Barbara's relationships, or lack, thereof. With all that said, Wilhelm is still one of my favorites writers and I eagerly await her next book!"
3,Good courtroom scenes,I love legal thrillers. There were times I got bogged down in the constant infusion of characters. As an attorney I was sometimes uncomfortable about the actions taken by the main character in representing her clients. I thoroughly enjoyed the courtroom scenes. They were very realistic. I would definitely read another Kate Wilhelm book
3,Outrageous.,Wilhelm's books are interesting but to ask for 12.00 for an out-of-print ten year old book is ridiculous. Good luck! The author should insist that older books go for a couple of dollars in order to hook new readers.
3,Her Usual Good Job,"Except for the somewhat overblown squabbling between the protagonist and her boyfriend, the best part of this series is the relationships. They're well rendered and pleasant to be part of. Even the cats are fun -- or maybe especially. The plot is interesting, too, and quite tricky. And in this episode, the judge acts more like a real one would. The author sometimes prattles -- I have no need to know about sweaty socks and detailed snack menus, etc."
5,Don't believe all you read,"There were some negative reviews for ""Defense for the Devil"" but I must say those reviewers were awfully picky. As in all books there were a couple of minor ""glitch points"", but as a recreational read, Kate Wilhelm has produced another great ""page turner"" book. I hope she does an additional dozen Barbara Holloway novels; I will buy every one!!!!!"
2,Disappointing book,"I wasn't able to read more than ninety pages of this book. Usually I devour Kate Wilhem's Barbara Gordon mysteries in a day or two and can't leave my seat until I'm finished. This time I got bored, the story didn't interest me, it dragged on, wasn't tightly written, didn't get to the heart of the issues. Don't know what happened this time but it was a mediocre plot, boring characters whom one doesn't really care about except the main character and those closest to her. Will reserve judgment until I read the next book."
4,Wait for new translation,Famously bad translation of the central piece of Adorno's philosophy. I recommend getting Aesthetic Theory now and waiting for the next translator's attempt.
1,Seriously?,Flood light bulb lasted less than 30 minutes. I am sure the life for a flood light should be a little longer. GE or vendor not sure?
5,Very Nice,Key cases are hard to find. I guess they are considered old fashioned. This is a very nice case. The hooks are quite substantial and hold up very well. The leather is very nice.
3,A little ambivalent...,"The ""made in China"" tag hidden in the little pocket was a surprise, got the impression this was supposed to be nicer than that. I do like the smaller-than-most size, the clips work well, and the feel of it is good. It took a LONG time to get here though, and they don't give you a tracking number unless you email them (and then wait a couple days for a response)."
3,Too short,"This is a very nice piece of work. The leather is beautiful. The hardware looks like it will last a long time. In fact, the quality of the metal hardware is light years ahead of any other key wallet that I have seen. But at 3.5 inches, the thing is just too short for the six keys that I carry around. Some of them poke out the bottom of the key case. The whole reason I carry use a key wallet is to protect my pants pockets from those keys. Disappointing."
1,This Toaster Is A Piece of Garbage,"Why don't they make good, reliable toasters anymore? This is the second toaster I've bought in the past 12 months, and it broke after about 3 months. It never toasted that well--frozen waffles and english muffins would take 2-3 ""press downs"" no matter what setting you put it on and they would go from untoasted to burnt on the last one. The last straw was when the heating element didn't get hot unless the side of the toaster was sharply hit. Then the ejector/setting button fell off. Do you have to spend ($$$) to get a decent toaster??"
3,A Beginners Choice,Are you price conscious? and still want a good toaster? This 2-slice toaster will serve your day-to-day needs. I have been using this without any problem.So just try it!
3,Teaches helpful points but repetitive,"This book pointed out some big differences between national cultures and how to better interact with people of another culture, but it felt repetitive. Maybe it was just that the full directions for each exercise were repeated several times, but I do know that I was able to skim through this book very rapidly. The workbook aspect and exercises to be completed helped me put these differences away in my memory better than simply reading about them, and for that reason I appreciated this book."
3,"no to much information, easy","The information is limited regarding diversity, it does not very much into dept, from the different aspects, althought it can be a good introductory book for undergrad"
4,8th annual World Power WheelStanding Championships.,"Some good drag racing and wheelies, good quality for the price. although the ads and announcer leave much to be desired, it's not that bad but could be better."
3,Birdhouse Book,Good for beginners. Would like more information on best types of woods. Where to find metal overlaps for bird erances.
1,bulbs did not work,Ordered two bulbs. One was cracked upon arrival and the other did not work. Don't want to go through the hassle of returning. Very disappointing.
1,only received 1 bulb,"I ordered this 5-pack a couple of weeks ago and received 5 individually packaged bulbs. I needed more so I reordered a few days ago. This time, I only received 1 bulb. I contacted amazon and was promised that they would fix the problem by sending me a 5-pack. I received the ""replacement"" package, but again, only 1 bulb. I contacted amazon again but have received no response. DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM, unless you want to pay eighteen dollars for a single bulb."
3,"Slow delivery, but good service...",It took a long time to get my adapter but the vendor included a 2x zoom lens with it as compensation for the delay. Good customer service in reponse to my inquiry regarding delivery.
3,Sony Adapter Ring,The adapter ring fits my Sony P93 perfectly. The ring however creates a black circle on the image until I zoom my lens about 50%. I had expected that by adding an expansion lens (via the adapter) that I would have both standard and expanded views; this is not the case.
5,Wonderful! She's done it again!,"When I started reading the J Brady series I waited for paperback. Not anymore. The timeworn phrase works here: I could not put the book down. I tried to make it last but alas, had to finish on the spot. Ending just a tad weak but all is forgiven if Ms Jance can just keep on with her concise and not too wordy details and very interesting characters."
4,Why did the author choose such a violent subject?,I enjoy reading the Joanna Brady mysteries but cannot recommend this one to my squeamish friends. I was surprised Jance chose such violent subject matter. Is this necessary???
3,Same-o same-o,"The Kirkus review is pretty much on the mark. Jance can be an excellent writer, and Brady's a great character, but the feeling one gets from this book is that Jance had to meet a deadline and just cranked another one out. ""Don't forget to throw in the serial killer, and focus on the macabre and grisly aspects of the killings and burials. Throw in some local color, move the townfolk along.""Jance starts a number of plot lines that go nowhere, as Kirkus explains. She focuses on the .50 caliber rifle, when the shootings could have been done by any rifle. She repeatedly raises the specter of a missing armory, which goes nowhere. There's no explanation of why a killer with several large rifles needs to borrow a deer rifle, or why the killer chooses to flee the area right as Brady discovers his identity.Hopefully in future books Jance will avoid the cliches the Brady series is falling into, particularly the unnecessary detailing of the killing process."
2,"More like ""Young Adult""","I didn't care for this. The writing is so poor, the only thing that keeps you going is the hope of solving the mystery, but other than that, I really don't have much to say about it. I won't be buying this author again."
5,Great Book,This one kept me reading well into the night. Just could not put it down. I think it is one of the best of the Joanna Brady Mystery
4,Very Good Mystery,"I recently discovered the Joanna Brady series and have been happily reading along and enjoying the character of a woman sheriff in a small town. At first, I thought that her wearing a suit and heels to work was ridiculous but I realized that she probably had to be conservative since she was the first woman sheriff in the region. I also enjoy the Arizona setting and Jance's deft interweaving of family, friends, and mystery.I wasn't nuts about the serial killer plot in this book -- I identified this person the moment they made an appearance in the book by the ""profile"" similar to many on TV cop shows and movies. However, I suppose serial killers are everywhere.Overall, the Joanna Brady series keeps my interest and I've read about nine books so far."
4,Another comfortable Jance mystery,"Every time I read J.A. Jance, I get this comfortable feeling, like I live in Arizona (though it is one of the few states I've never visited). Sheriff Brady must find a serial killer who scalps the victims as part of his/her trademark. Could the killer be part of the new Apache dude ranch? Or could it be a disgruntled rancher tired of government regulation? The story gets complicated and even fairly kinky as we discover some of the deepest darkest secrets of the Cochise county citizens. You will not be dissappointed with this book."
4,6th installment kept me riveted,Thoroughly enjoyable! Jance steps up the game a bit with a series of brutal scalpings and murders. I enjoyed the continuity of the mystery thread and the personal development of Sheriff Brady's life. This is a well-wrought blend of characterization and plot.
3,A Killer is Loose,The idea of a serial killer on the loose has been done to death. The bodies are stacking up like cord wood and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. RATTLESNAKE CROSSING gives fans the impression Ms. Jance was under contract obligations to meet a deadline and cranked out a pot boiler.It didn't have the spark of expert craftsmanship that others of both of her series have exhibited. It is difficult to pin point what is missing except that both Joanna and her supporting characters seemed static. But as part of the series Jance is forgiven and we'll be back for more cases that involve a favorite lady sheriff.Then maybe I'm just tired of killers who kill to kill after listening to the news on a daily basis.Writing as a Small BusinessQualifying Laps: A Brewster County NovelNatchez Above The River: A Family's Survival In The Civil War
3,The Shat is cheesy in this too,"The only reason to buy this film is to see William Shatner's pompous acting and laugh at his erroneous self-confidence. It is decently entertaining but I wasn't feeling any real ""part Comanche"" in his acting."
2,Brothers keeper,"This is a Story Written by Robert I Holt and the Famous Frank Gruber who gave us Stories such as ""BROKEN LANCE"" AND ""BIG LAND"" and many others.This story is about a family of twin brothers born to White Father and an Indian Mother.One grew up in town yet respected the Indian Values and the other with the indian's but gone wild,Both played by William Shatner.Only diffrence to tell them apart was by the colour of their eyes,one with black eyes was called Notha killing and plundering and living wild with his renegade tribe, while other was of blue eyes called Johnny Moon, always getting mistaken,punished , beaten up for the crimes of the other .Till one day he could stand no more so he asked Notha for a showdown to finish this once for all in the town of Rio Hondo where the sheriff Logan played by Joseph Cotten.It is a Battle bitween Good and and the one gone astray.William Shatner acted very well in this one as always but this movie lost the grip and became a routine half way down."
2,Pros And Cons,"Let me first say that my dog likes to chew on all of her toys: tug toys, tennis balls, etc. This toy was an excellent idea! She enjoyed it until it started to come apart... 2 days later. The loop came out from the knot although the knot stayed right in place, just like the seller says it will. The knot still exists, one week later, but the rope portion has been torn into little pieces and lays strewn across our carpet.In conclusion, this is a great toy for a dog that plays softly. My dog plays rough and tough, so it didn't work too well for her. And be prepared to clean up the shreds of string that come out of it."
2,Save your money for some decent strings,"I thought I would give these Sensicore strings a try since they are so much cheaper than others. Of the six strings, I only kept 3 on my bass viol. The high D and low D strings may earn 3 or 4 stars. At first, I had hopes for the E string which is always a difficult string. However, it came unwound after 3 or 4 months. The C string was the worst. It was literally unplayable so I sent it back. The company replaced it even though that was against their policy. The replacement string was not much better. I ended up replacing the G, C, and A strings with my old strings within a couple days. Now I wish I had that money to put toward a decent set of strings."
1,blehh.,"ok, i had to read this book for school, and it was one of the worst books i have ever encountered. usually i am a big history buff, but this book was just annoying. i ended up falling asleep about halfway through because it was so boring, and i had to stay up all night to finish it. this book is definitely nowhere near anything i would consider worthwhile, and would not recommend it to anyone, unless they were using it to fall asleep faster. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good book, ...........but not good Michener","Mr. Michener spent the first 32 pages of the book explaining how it was that a writer in his 80's could produce so much in such a short period of time. It was almost an excuse. This book was originally intended to be a part of his massive Texas, but was dropped before the final editing. This book gives a very brief outline of the biographies of Santa Anna, the Eagle, and Sam Houston, the Raven. Though really just a thumbnail sketch of each man, Michener is not afraid to tell it like it really was, instead of the homogonized versions one usually finds in biographies. The subjects, Santa Anna & Houston, are fascinating, and Michener's sampling makes one long for a more detailed accounting of each man's life. Perhaps this was Michener's intent. The book is short, and somewhat choppy, jumping from man to man chronologically. As a book, it was very interesting, and a quick read. As an example of Michener's work......... look elsewhere."
3,A Casual Read,"I've never been a big Michener fan, but in this tome, he does an adequate job of comparing the lives and personalities of Santa Anna and Sam Houston. Riding on the hype of the Texas Sesquicentennial, Michener takes the reader on an informal tour of early Mexico and Texas. He touches on events in the U.S. as well as in Europe where they apply to the story. What I really enjoyed most were the excellent drawings by noted artist Charles Shaw. He is among the best!"
4,Nice read,"Not your typical 1000 page historical drama, a very nice read bt choppy at times switching from character to character."
5,The Sun Shines Through,"Without doubt, this is one of the most happy, enjoyable musical experiences I've had for some time. Just sit back and let that Ethiopean sunshine light up your day."
4,Fundamentals of Track and Field,"I was happy with this book as soon as I opened the front cover. I am a new track coach who ""only has a clue"" about track from what I have observed from my star athlete daughter. I am pleased with this book because it has a lot of drawings which show good form in executing running, throwing, and jumping events. It is the perfect book for elementary school, middle school track athletes. It gives coaching tips after every explaination, common errors and corrections, and lots of drills to help reinforce the new skills the students learn. I highly recommend it for the beginning track coach, or the old track coach who is getting stale and needs new games and drills to keep track fun."
4,Senior coach,Excellent reference.Author has produced a worthy contribution to this sport.Very good text and for most of the diagrams.In many diagrams I dis-agree with how the lead-leg ankle-angles at take-off and landing are illustrated.Hammer section shows sequences with serious technical errors. Just ignore that chapter.
4,Required Reading,Fundamentals of track and field covers all the basics. The exercises are creative and easy to apply. Athletes acquire basic skills without too much conscious effort.
5,Featuring 3 compostions by Don,great Swamp Pop CD with backgound music unique with Dons band. Brass section outstanding.
1,"Junk, loose handle, paint flaked, poor toasting ability","I bought this toaster because I liked the idea of a removable lining. Being able to remove the liner and place it in the dishwasher was too much for me to resist.....As it turns out, that was the only good thing about this toaster oven. Within two weeks, the handle on the door started to loosen, it didn't toast things very well, and to top it all off......when I wiped the interior of the glass door with a wet sponge, the black paint began to flake off. I returned mine."
1,another serious warning,"We had this toaster for four months, and one day wanted to heat up some pizza. We had it set at about 350, not even the highest broiler setting, and while still heating up, the front glass shattered, blew comletely out!!! Don't buy this one! At least we didn't have a fire like the other person, but it was truly astounding what happened, to a new toaster that was not cheap."
1,Total...,"It burns everything, including itself. The handle melted off.I have it on the lightest setting. Can't imagine what it might do if I set it for ""darker."" The smoke started turning my cabinets brown. Unfortunately, I got my issue of Consumer Reports AFTER I bought it. I'm going to call Toastmaster and see if they'll issue a refund. If not, I will never buy another product from them again."
1,the worst toaster oven we have ever owned,"This is the absolute worst toaster oven that we have purchased. We too were lured in by the removeable liner and pop-tart setting. This toaster oven has burned every last thing we have tried to toast/bake in there. Also, a weird condensation is occurring on the glass door and on the top of the toaster oven every time that we use it.Don't waste your money!"
1,Worst toaster oven I have ever owned,"I was attracted to this oven by the easy clean insert. This toaster oven really doesn't need it because it burns everything, who can use it. I have other toast master products and haven't had a problem. I think a recall would be in order on this one. The reason I'm here today is to buy a new toaster oven, and it won't be another one of these!"
3,good movie,"its a good movie but if your not big into a slow going doc, you can see the majority of the good parts on youtube, either way tho if your a collector of good car movies, definitely a must for your collection"
1,You've got to be kidding me,"If you want to see Cannonball Run stuff, you'll get it. But most of the participants in this documentary drive and act like completely irresponsible idiots. If you want to learn and understand about the true ideal of the Cannonball Baker Memorial Trophy Dash, read Brock Yates book, Cannonball! Real people who take long run, high speed performance driving seriously (and have fun) while focusing on not endangering anyone's life... I was disappointed in the extreme, because until I saw this video, I thought the Gumball 3000 looked like a great idea, and something I wanted to do..."
2,Just a fancy note book,Dont be fooled into thinking that you are getting a new set of patterns or something that you have not tried yet. there is minimal basic knowledge and then the rest is pages of grid paper. Cute and functional to a point. But not what I expected from this author.
4,Almost perfect,"I bought this journal after trying to use a day planner for my knitting journal- there wasn't enough room! It is practically perfect in every way, except for a couple things- there is too much space dedicated to sweater designing on paper doll models, and not enough room for listing projects I want to make. I second the suggestion of adding a section for accesory design in the next edition."
4,Inexpensive hose,"I bought this to relocate my hose reel in the backyard, and it has proven to be a decent buy. I have had no issues with leaking, and that's all that I can really ask for here."
4,"Good length for my needs, kinks from packing are working themselves out","I needed a relatively short garden hose and this APEX REM 15-foot hose fit the bill at a reasonable price. This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.Ali Julia review"
3,"Low quality hose, but OK for dehumidifier","This was not the greatest quality of hose. The one I received had a few kinks bent into it. I'm sure with time, I could have straightened them but it wasn't necessary. I cut this hose down to 4 feet so I could use it to drain my dehumidifier. Works for this purpose, but not sure I'd really want to use it as a connection hose outdoors."
1,These clowns wasted my time,"I bought the Apex hose remnant, and the day I was supposed to receive it an email arrived saying it would be delayed, offering a new ship date in two days, and asking me to approve it via Amazon. I did. The next day I received an email saying that it would be delayed by another day, and asking me to approve the new ship date via Amazon or the order wouldn't go out. I did. The next email showed up almost right away, same thing. This has now gone on for two weeks, and three things are clear: (1) They don't have the hose and have no idea when they're getting it, and (2) they don't care enough about their customers to provide a realistic estimate or a simple explanation or apology, instead (3) sending out automated rope-a-dope emails until the suckers are irritated enough to let the order die. Which is where I am now, six unexplained delays later with a sure knowledge that if I click on ""approve new ship date"" I'll have an email within hours telling me to approve another one."
1,Got one of the cheap ones. Already busted!,"It seems from the reviews I read here that some people get quality remnants and some do not. I fall into the latter category. I got a thin, cheap green garden hose. After attaching a nozzle and opening the spigot all the way, I could feel the hose already begin to bulge. I used it for a few weeks until one day I turned the spigot on and went inside to get some supplies I needed. When I came out moments later, water was spraying out of a gaping hole that had developed in the middle of the hose."
1,it is just a mid-low grade graden hose,"This hose cost me $9 and it is just a garden hose which I can purchase in any harward store. The picture shown is black and looks like a heavy-duty washer hose, but when I got it, it is just a mid-low standard ""green"" garden hose. Do not get fooled with the picture and ad ""Colors May Vary"". To conclude, it is not worth the price -- $9."
1,Not as advertised,"Bought this hose to be used with a utility pump I purchased in the same order. They claim that it would not collapse when drawing water into the pump (The sides would be stiff). Well when I got the hose it was already collapsed and flat from shipping before using and it was a very cheap piece of hose and cheap fittings, not like the picture (I know that they say colors may vary but I thought the quality would be the same as pictured.) Would send back but not worth the effort.... Threw it out... and bought a cheap 50' hose for $9.95 at Lowes and a hose repair connector... cut it to 15' clamp on the connector and works great. Still have 35' left to make more if needed. Buyer beware."
2,eh it works,"i guess for the price all you can ask is that it works but barely. hose kinks very easy disrupting water flow and leaks where connected to the spicket, but water does get from point a to point b so i cant give it one star."
5,Hard to find length hose. The hose looks to be durable.,"Its amazing how hard it is to fine a hose shorter than 25 or heck even 50 feet. This isn't a ""remnant"". There is a tag right on the hose that says 15'. The connectors are like you'd find on any other hose. Its not the best hose material out there, but its a lot better than most of them. I think this should last a few years."
2,Don't leave pressure on this hose!,Used this hose for less than a week and had it burst. It was left on for about a day with pressure since we had it extending a hose bib. For light duty work it may be ok.
1,leaky fittings,"This hose is not worth the money or time spent getting it. It dose have brass fittings, but both fittings leak. When under pressure both ends spray all over. Send this product back to China!!"
1,Kinked hose with vinyl separating - Returned!,I read the other reviewers who had similar problems before I bought this. I also read the reviews raving about this hose. Since these hoses are maid from remnants; I suppose its a matter of luck as to which hose you get. My luck wasn't good. The hose had permanent kinks and the vinyl skin had bubbles where it was separating from the hose.Returned it immediately.
5,Simply Perfect,"I was a little hesitant to order this hose because of all the mixed reviews. But I took the leap and am glad I did. It's perfect. It's made a very heavy, durable material that isn't prone to kinking. I just needed a little something to water my front garden and this really fit the bill."
4,Good buy hose remnants,"I appreciate being able to buy a hose less than 25', and for a great price also. I am not sure I will buy many more as I would pay more to insure I would get the kind of hose I want - I am eco conscious and do not want hoses with lead etc, and this way of purchasing does not allow me to choose the type of hose remnant I would receive. The one I got however was a good buy and decent quality. I personally am afraid of pot luck and prefer to specify the type of hose I am purchasing. Personal choice."
2,hose connector for dehumidifier,"Apex REM 15 15-Feet Connector Hose Remnants, Colors May VaryCould not connect this hose to the dehumidifier so I wouldn't have to keep emptying the bucket. Could not connect it no matter how hard I tried. VERY small space to turn the end that goes onto the dehumidifier receptacle, and I have small hands; even tried using pliers; even tried using handy-person. Would not work. It got 2 stars because I plan to use it elsewhere where size doesn't matter and because it's probably a design flaw of the dehumidifier not the hose, but Amazon shouldn't promote it as a connector for this appliance."
4,better than the amazon brand HDMI,I bought this cable to replace my less than half year old amazon basics HDMI. that cable stopped working after a couple months. this one is a lot more sturdy and it is working well. expect it is only 60Hz. I would prefer one that's 120Hz if I were to buy another one.
2,Would not have needed to buy this,"I received a 15-foot standard garden hose, something I could have bought at Home Depot or Target for 2/3 the price."
4,It is good for your backyard.,"It is easy to use and you don't need to buy it in any store. Just order it, wait 2 days and use it."
1,OMG!!,"We've had this hose for a little more than two months and came home today to discover it had burst a hole in it while we were away. To be fair, it is left in a pressurized state as we turn the water on and off further down the line. Either way it burst a hole and we had water everywhere. I had purchased one for a family member last week and will return that one as I cannot return this one. Glad we weren't away on vacation for a week!!Very Disappointing...."
4,What I needed,"I was tired of buying short hose remnants at Home Depot that were basically cr*p and needed to be replaced within a year. I was very happy with the quality of this one, and look forward to not having to buy another next year."
1,A REAL RIP OFF,The photo shows a Black Rubber hose. What I received was a low grade Blue cheap plastic hose. The hose ends are also made very cheap. DO NOT BUY THIS HOSE GO TO YOUR LOCAL GARDEN CENTER and save your self the ripoff.
3,It's just a regular hose,"Nothing special. It is sold as a good idea to buy with some items, like the dehumidifier, but it's just a mediocre 15 ft. hose with normal garden-hose connectors."
4,I would buy it again,"Very nice hose. Seems to be high quality. I bought it to go along with a pool cover pump and I have only used it in the very cold weather months (we don't cover in the summer). That being said, the hose is a bit stiff and unruly in the cold temps but I will take that over a less quality hose that kinks or splits. I personally would buy it again."
4,dehumidifier drain hose,The hose works OK and the length is great for our application. If the hose were a bit more flexible it would be great. Other than that it is a very high quality peice of hose.
2,A kinky hose...,"I received the green version of this hose. It was neatly packaged but the hose had a permanent kink in it that didn't let much water through it. It didn't leak or anything, so it was good in that aspect. Since I didn't need such a long hose I was able to just cut it off where the kink was and it's working now. I just can't use the attachment at one end, but it serves it's purpose for me. I guess other people get different colors of this hose and some seem to be better than others."
4,Chevy Vette Fest Dvd.,"This is a full throttle Video DVD(they make sub-par/cheap dvds somewhat good) this dvd has too many commercials and people representing the companies, Some interviews w/car owners, overall dvd is ok, Was expecting something different."
4,Nice grill/griddle for the money,"I've had this appliance for several months now. I bought it so that I could have a grill pan to cook with (I didn't want to have to buy a cast iron grill pan)I like how it cooks, and it has a nice drain hole on the end to drain excess grease, and I also like that it has both a flat and a grill surface, and that you don't have to flip it over. the drawbacks are that I can't put it in the dishwasher because it's rather large, and it's also very slow in heating up--but cools very quickly if you accidently turn it off. Seeing as how it's alluminum, I don't see why it takes so long to heat up. All in all though, I still really like it and I use it fairly often."
2,Don't buy this book unless you are a collector of famous books,"This book was published in 1910 and its style is not suitable for studying math, so its value is mostly as a historic perspective. In my opinion, this book belongs only in specialized libraries since it is not suitable for students and frankly I don't see what anyone would learn to use from it. I have great respect for both authors for their contribution in the mathematics, but the book is antiquated."
2,Postwar Tokyo????,"I purchased this book because ""Sketches of Postwar Tokyo"" was of interest. I was very disappointed because my idea of ""Postwar Tokyo"" is Tokyo shortly after the war. If I wrote a book ""Sketches of Postwar U.S."", it would be the United States from 1945 until 1950. It's quite a stretch to talk about Japan 50 years later and call it postwar! The book also contained some inaccuracies. I lived in Japan for 13 years and therefore know something about the country."
1,Disconnected and unrealistic.,"As a young person myself, I found the conversation in this novel between the main characters unrealistic. There are several moments during reading when I frequently have to put down the book and think to myself, ""Would I EVER say that?"" The plot seems disconnected at times, and the characters of the book lack characteristics of young people."
4,Old fasioned bulbs,Unlike modern CFLs or LEDs. These bulbs get hot when you turn them on and they take a lot of power. But they fit into the old socket and have a very nice light.
5,I like it!,"This bulb has the soft beige glow I've been looking for, as I hate fluorescent lights. A bit pricey, but it goes perfectly in my table lamp. No problems so far."
1,Dud!,"Upon using this item for the first time, the bulb blew up immediately after being switched on! This was the exact bulb type required for a new lamp we had purchased. After cleaning up the mess and going to the local home store to replace the bulb, the new lamp worked fine. Not sure if it had been damaged in shipping or what, but this was not a good experience. We needed the lamp immediately, so I did not bother trying to return a bunch of dangerous glass shards through shipping. Buyer beware!"
5,A compendium of business knowledge a la Dilbert,"If you are a lover of the office philosophy and observations of Dilbert and the gang then you will love this book. It is truly what the title suggests in that the publisher took three popular Dilbert books and placed them together into one large volume. As always, the biting humor and often accurate portrayal of all things corporate will have you laughing out loud as you realize how absolutely preposterous some of the situations are while also realizing that this sure looks a lot like real life."
3,Used it a couple times...,"If you have a big camp site/camper, this is a great storage utility. However, we pack lite...had it hung over picnic table under canopy...usde it for plates etc..."
4,Coleman Hanging Picnic Organizer a hit,"The Coleman Hanging Organizer (I didn't use mine for a picnic, but rather to keep blankets, towels, clothes off the floor and dry) is a great addition to a family sized tent. I wouldn't want it in a small tent, but it worked great for me. The one thing I would say is that it is too big to go into a standard tub (by about 1.5""), it doesn't have a carrying case, and this leaves it a bit awkward to pack...it ends up being one of those items thrown in after everything else. Other than that, I'm happy."
4,As a series?,"I really liked this as a book...it's hard to find anything to read in between Buffy books and a few scattered titles...but according to the back cover, this isn't just a short trilogy - several books are planned for a series. It's original and captivating. Lucy has lost her mother and gone to live with an uncaring aunt and step-cousin in an all new area when she witnesses the death of a girl she can't save. As things get supernatural, she accepts help from a mysterious student who she develops a rare connection with. BUT, the end to the first book comes violently and abruptly with more loss all around, and it doesn't seem there are any characters left to make any further books anything other than Lucy, crazy and walking around alone and talking to herself. Which doesn't sound too interesting."
2,"2 1/2 ""Heels"" for It Begins","In a nutshell, Lucy who has just lost her mother, is forced to leave her home, friends and everything she knows, to move in with her Aunt Irene (who her Mother could not stand and barely ever talked about) and her Step-Cousin Angela, even though neither of them really want her there and don't go out of their way to be hospitable. Then she meets Byron, a sexy boy that all the girls want but can't have, as he keeps to himself, but he has a dark secret only for Lucy. Read my full review here: http://shoes-n-more.blogspot.com/2012/01/book-reviews-second-grave-on-leftit.html"
5,"The Unseen, great, simple story...","Simple and straight forward like Ellen Hopkin's poems but yet written like a fantasy and real life story like the twilight series. I love this book and the other three which follow, it's a story that jumps at you and it lures you in slowly to enjoy. Being a huge fan of such stories and fantasy genres I found this a delight when I found it at a book sale so I went searching for the other three and they were pure pleasure as well."
1,Unfunny and uninspired,"Other reviewers have it spot-on: this book is not (or very rarely) funny, poorly written, self-indulgent, and in particular offers no management insight at all, aside from informing airline managers how customers perceive their product, which I suppose was not exactly a secret."
3,"Good, but better books out there","I found this book enjoyable, as it is good to find a kindred spirit who is also fed up with the airlines and flying. But he isn't very informational on how to overcome some of the difficulties we all have, like Celentino's ""Combating Air Rage"", but it is still interesting. Plus, Celentino's book is more humorous for us extreme ""extremies"" travelers."
1,Why I Hate This Flying Book,"Publishers are wrapping small books that may not be worth a softcover in a business hardcover to give the author (and publisher)stature. This $...diminutive edition is title driven but once you open the book, the drive is dead. It would easy to say academics are self-indulgent and humorless but this book builds the stereotype. The first clue is the use of his mother with one of those cute quotes ""Well, let them laugh, Henry. You can always try again."" on the back cover. You can point to any page to find similar ... humor - ""The food is taking so long it as though they are out catching the fish -"" Page 69. The leading thinker's preening egotism is unfortunate in that the subtitle promised real humor can be found in a business under terrific strain. The publisher must owe the author a book. Based on this book, I would avoid his management seminars as well."
1,not worth the time or money,"The only thing worse than an insufferable, ivory-tower know-it-all is one who makes dumb, senseless jokes about everything. Just read Mintzberg's WHY I HATE FLYING. The fact is, this book leads one to conclude that Mintzberg is the type who is ready to hate just about anything without taking the trouble to find out the first thing about it. This so-called authority on ""management"" has obviously never interviewed a pilot, gate agent, ticket agent, or flight attendant. These are the folks who have to put up with people like Mintzberg who think that profit-seeking (like every other industry)commercial airlines should be moving companies, hotels, and 5-star restaurants all rolled into one. In all, the groundlessness of his arguments combine with a weak (and this is being generous) sense of humor make this book a total bust."
1,Very irritated I spent money on this book,"So, I'm at O'Hare and I pick up this book because I hate flying too. Read the first ten pages or so and realized to my horror that this piece of tripe was all I had to read for the next few hours.The purchase of this book led to me reading the inflight magazine. Dreadful, just dreadful. The only reason I didn't leave it in the seatback in front of me is because I didn't want to inflict the same damage on another poor traveler."
1,Theory vs. Reality,"I started reading this book in one of the lounges at JFK's Terminal One (and continued reading it over an excellent glass of wine on my way to Frankfurt). Hence the atmosphere was right somehow). Mr. Mintzberg is one of these ""Professor of Economics Guru"" who's frequently travelling and knows all about the world - except the real one. The ""real one"" in today's economics is surviving, especially for the airline industry. Airlines do have to fill their planes and make more revenues than they do have cost - as simple as that! Obviously Mr. Mintzberg has a hard time to get used to the fact that airlines can't give away anything for free. He's one of these guys spending 150 bucks for going overseas and expecting - of course - an upgrade for free including all the good stuff served in Business and First Class. Since that does not happen all the time he's blowing out all of his frustrations in this book. I feel sorry for having spent the money for this book, it's not worth it."
4,Read this and go ahead ON BOARD!,"Highly recommended and very good book, ""Why I Hate Flying"" allows readers to feel the insight of the frequent travellers. This book will make you realize that is not only a jet-legged persona but it is really cool to be on stand by flyers. This book is so cool to be read while you waiting for your next flight. Read it! Its a MUST for all flyers."
2,Not Appropriate for all Models,"I purchased this case for a P200 and, when the case arrived, I was surprised to find out how large this case really is. It may be be appropriate for earlier P models, but why buy a large case for a small camera? My camera literally rattles around in this case. I opened the packaging, and will not return it to Amazon because I fear a re-stocking charge. I will probably 're-gift' this case to someone who has an earlier P model, and look for a generic case that is closer to the size of the camera than this leftover case. My guess is that Sony did not want to bother fabricating a new case for its newer, smaller, cameras and simply wanted to continue selling what it has in stock."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the worst waffle maker I've ever owned. It doesn't cook evenly no matter the setting. If you like your waffles uncooked and doughy in the middle - this is the griddle for you!!! Truly, keep looking!! This isn't worth the space Amazon gives to it!!!"
5,waffle iron you'll love to use,"I used this waffle iron in a store to sell a waffle mix.It was great! Very first to the last waffle was perfect. I used it 5 days for 8 hours a day. Only sprayed it with oil first time I used it. Never any sticking.Temperture control was great. I made waffles light or dark.Had to buy one for myself, I couldn't do without one.Did some comparsion shopping and couldn't find one for the price that had temperture control and light that lets you know when waffle is done.Regina"
5,Worked great,"Tired of paying restaurant prices for waffles for my growing kid.... snatched up this one at the local Goodwill. Read up on the instructions, and they turned out great. Despite the non stick coating, it works better if you spray it lightly. No more paying for extra strawberries and whipped cream. :)"
3,Good book about Blacks in Brazil,"This book posits that focusing on the beauty of such films as ""Black Orpheus"" deflects from the fact that there is rampant anti-black racism in Brazil. If I remember correctly, the author is a scholar at an HBCU (historically Black College or University). At times, I think he borrows from canonical white thinkers too heavily. However, I still think it was a good book. It has parallels to life in America where politicians want to talk about what they dislike on television rather than explain why they haven't enacted more bills for the people. Individuals who collect books on Blacks in the New World Diaspora should definitely purchase this piece."
2,Entertaining but useless for potty training,My daughter is almost two. she liked to watch the video because of the singing and dancing but it did not help her to potty train at all. They do not spend nearly enough time showing children using the potty and the children singing and dancing are all too old to be in a potty training video. There is also a monkey in the video which I still do not understand the point of that at all. If you are looking for a video to help teach potty training then look elsewhere.
2,I gotta go review,"my 21 mth old and 31 mth old found this boring. they wouldnt even sit and watch it for 5 minutes. the kids in the videos are 4-7 year old children playing and singing songs about having to go to the potty, but my toddlers don't understand the message."
3,What a CD!?,"Ok, For one thing Aaron is HOT. Well I love him but his Cd needs a little work I mean having your brother on the CD with you is cool and everything but he could have alot more people. Does he have any remixes?? If so I haven't heard them and I am his Number one fan I get all of his Cds even his VERY FIRST one So I think he needs more songs and definately more remixes with special guests."
2,Too much rap and too mature...........thumbs down!,"The lyrics on this album are not only offensive but also much too adult for younger fans. I regret picking this one up for my daughter. It's not anything like the ""Aaron's Party"" CD which I thought was pretty well done. The worst song on the whole CD would have to be the Cowgirl song...... lil'Mama ?????? Come on!"
3,rachww,This is the great cd youve been waiting for.It has great songs you will never forget.Aaron's nice but his cd's way nicer but he's ok.Don't totally hate him.He's just normal like everyone else ok.some people think he's a magastar but he's not he's just a teen.mostely like a teen then a magastar at least.Now do you see what i mean.Ok thats nice.Ok see ya around.Aaron in the house Aaron Aaron Aaron AAAAAaaaaarrrrrooooonnnnn.Im screming your name.seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ya.
4,Pop,"Aaron has provided us with another fun-lovin album that will make people smile and others moan. Most people think Aaron has survived due to who his brother is, but Aaron has shown on this album thast he can finally cut it. Standout tracks are: Come Follow Me, Oh Aaron, Baby Its You, Im All About You and Hey You. Aarons music is not to be taken too seriously, its fun music to listen to with your friends"
2,"AARON CAPITALIZES ON BROTHER NICKS FAME, AND LOSES","Aaron is out with his sophomore effort ""Oh Aaron"".Aaron has a career because his brother is one of the lead singers from a little band called Backstreet Boys.If Aaron did not have this link he would not have a album career and come out with shmultzy songs like ""How I Beat Shaq"", etc.I do give him (2) stars instead of (1) because he is a innocent kid singing innocent songs which children need in todays music pop world, however could we have kids that are singing with talent, and not just give someone a recording contract who is related to a major talent (by the gene pool).Oh Nick! I want to be a singer just like you! Can I have a recording contract,,,,puuuuhhhhhhhhlease!.While other artists with true talent struggle and struggle. Its not what you know its WHO you know, and WHO you are related to that will get you ahead in this business."
3,Aaron...Your brother is a better singer!,I really did not like the album! I thought it sucked! But I did like the first song on the album titled OH AARON with Nick Carter singing in some of it which made the song really good. I am more of a Nick Carter fan rather than an Aaron fan.
2,Oh Aaron This Stinks!,"Aaron Carter's second album Oh Aaron Is bad. It is horrible having to listen to this boy trying to rap!I do think when I hear him sing instead of annoying the crap out of me by rapping, he sings great & he has a good singing voice & sounds like his brother! Instead Of wasting his time trying to rap he is better off singing otherwise I do not think he will get very far!However I did like 1 song when he sung like I'm All About us, & the rest of the album stunk!I recommend Nick Carter Now or Never instead of Oh Aaron!"
2,2 stars for 3 good songs,"Ive been a humungus aaron fan since he was 9! but when this album came along, i was pretty upset, i wish I could say I loved every minute of it, but that would just be a lie. I was upset at the way he sings, not his voice, but the way he uses it. He said his album would be more grown up and he was going to rap, well, thats really not rap, not at all, not even close, he sounds young on this record, and like he didnt put much effort into the music, because of it, it might hurt him in the long run, but I hope that it does not. I did enjoy the songs ""Im all about you"", ""Hey You"" and ""Baby Its You"" they just caught my attention real well, but I could not get into any of the rest. Im still a big aaron fan though, maybee the next album will be different."
3,People...CHILL!!!,"First of all before I start my review I want to tell people like..hmm...(Mandi from Florida) to simmer down! Guys, it's just Aaron Carter, and people whether they liked his cd or not are entitled to their opinions, and it's uncool to chew people out for being honest. Okay, about the cd. I didn't buy it, my friend got it for her birthday, so I listened to it, and I'll admit, if nothing more, the songs are catchy. It was a good effort by Aaron, and I do believe that he has talent. But they were extremley cheezy. I'm sorry but, number 10...what is that? Okay, I don't want to tear him down, but this is a cd mainly for ages 6-13, kids will love the upbeat lyrics, but older people will find it a little too sugar-coated. It's the truth. Cya!"
3,Aaron needs some work,"Ok I like Aaron but I am not a really big fan. His last cd was great I cant put any regrets but now WOOH aarons voice goes high and low in some parts where its not supposed to be, and Aaron no offence to the people that love him but he totaly needs work on his raping, that was soo funny. Any Way Aaron is nice but I would not reccomend this cd that is why it is fairly a 3 because some of the songs are well, a little boring. Here are some you should look at, DreamStreet and Nsyncs new cds. Thanks For Your Time."
2,Not Great,"I am going to keep this review fairly short... I was EXTREMELY disappointed when I listned to this CD, however, I do need to give credit to this artist because of his age. Flat out and simple; I would not recomend this CD to anyone over the age of 15, and secondly, I would not recomend this CD to most of the male population. My advice is this... If you want to purchase this album, listen to it before you buy it. All-in-all I was very disappointed."
5,This is not Aaron's Party,"This CD is really well done. It kinda sounds like Nelly a bit- in some parts. We think it's worth buying, if you're not sure. Nick gives it a little extra mmph."
1,Come on!,"This isn't joseph i am his youngest daughter.Aaron Carter is a wannabe rapper who just doesn't get what people mean by go away! I mean go away and never sing a lick again please, not go away and make more sickening CDs. Cow Girl (lil mama) what is that. I would have sincerely stopped after jump on the fizzy what in the world is a fizzy you bimbo.Hopefully you will get the meaning of go away soon or the world may just have to do it."
5,Go Aaron!!!,"I'm puertorican and I love Aaron's last CD(Oh Aaron).Aaron's agreat singer and a real hottie!When I bought his second album(Aaron's Party)I kind of liked it.But when I heard that he just did another album I got it as soon it got to Puerto Rico,and it was even better!!!He is soooo cute.Well,here are the songs of this CD:1.Oh,Aaron 2.Not too young,not too old 3.Break my stride 4.Comefollow me 5.I would 6.Baby it's you 7.I'm all about you 8.the kid in you 9.Hey you 10.CowgirlI like them all,but the one's I specially like are:Not too young,not too old,the best, it's really catchy.I'm all about you,I heard this song for the first time I melt!He's got a sexy voice.and Hey you,great song!Oh, before I go I don't care what some people think about him,I like him SO WHAT!!If you don't OK, is what you think.I'LL LOVE YOU AARON FOREVER!!Take care."
2,What is this?,"Ok, I'm gonna give him 2 stars for this.....1.) Because that's the lowest rating on here, and 2.) Because he tried.Ok, I admit some songs are good, but I mean the song, not the person behind it. In this case, it would be Aaron. I take that back, the songs are stupid. Ok, he can't sing. You call that rapping? Well...maybe it is, but it needs some work. Jeez, give me a record deal, and I'll blow him out of the music scene...FOR GOOD! Aaron, I'm 15, and take my advice. Switch over to pop music. Don't rap, although your voice is ok!!!! sing something better, you may not have the best voice, but hey, I bet if you tried to sing something more like....Britney Spears type music, you would be a big hit. Why don't you try it. Just make some pop music with an edge and you got it. Hell, I'll write it for ya. Well that's all. This album could use some work on it. Latez."
5,Can you spell AARON?,"Definately for the kids, this great CD makes your heart sing, its not just rap music, but a combination of taste and happiness that makes your heart sing"
4,the songs are so damn catchy!,"aaron carter has always come up with catchy pop tunes and this cd is no exception! of course the songs feat Nick ""oh aaron"" and ""not too young blah blah..."" are good, but take Nick away, and i highly recommend "" come follow me"" very catchy!!"
1,"Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, etc.","Oh Aaron.... Yeah, that's something I just can't imagine any woman saying, especially to him. He's bad and I'm not sure if he's even still in the business."
1,"Vulgar, obscene, and downright dirty...","I am amazed how someone so disguistingly obscene could get his own record deal (i mean, its not like it was rigged...Aron would NEVER do that!)Anyway, why is there no Parental label on this filth?!Its dirty!Disguisting!...BR>Why was everyone upset about Eminem when this sleezebag flew under the radar?While innocent Eminem was rapping about happines and love Aron Carter was thrashing about heck, demons, and violence and pinned the blame on Eminem for screwing up his followers!"
5,Oh Aaron is Oh So Good!,This is the best cd Aaron has made.He has grown up a lot since the last album. This cd is a mix of pop/rap/R&B and feat. no secrets and big brother nick.if your Carter crazy then u should really check this out.even if your not you might be surprised about how good it is(it also helps that he's really hot!)
1,Broken Case,"The case is broken, and there was sticky stuff over the top of the CD. Definitely not what the seller advertised. I bought a more expensive one for a reason, expecting the quality to be better. This was not the case, however."
5,Great CD,"really good cd, the 3 that arent on the U.S. album are Get Up Ya Feet, One For The Summer, and Everybody Stand Up. One For the Summer was previously released as a ""b"" track for the How I Beat Shaq single, and the two others I've heard on the internet are really great, and the whole cd is definately worth it!"
2,Downright Bad,"I'm sorry but I think this album is a total and humiliating flop. Seriously...'Oh Aaron', the name just seems so concieted (and the song IS so concieted). He's only in the music world because of his brother Nick, but that's just my opinion."
2,mixed emotions,I bought this cd for my younger cousin for my birthday and she made me listen to it in the car. I hated it because aaron can't sing and the songs are horrible. But I have to admit that it is a good cd for a younger kid. The songs are upbeat and have corny and harmless lyrics. If you need a present for little kid under 10 they will probably like this.
5,Aaron Rox,his new cd is the best he sounds better then before and the songs are great and he is verry very very very very hott on the cover of his cd
4,Deep inside MAC OS X,Very nice book. It goes where the rest of the book on the matter don't reach. If you're curious about every system file on Tiger you got the answer in this book.
4,celtic weave crucifix,Larger than I expected. Have gotten compliments on it after shining it up. Don't think it's silver though.
5,Retractable charging connection for cell phone to laptop,The small gadget allows for easy charging and transfer of information from laptop to computer. Great when an outlet is not around and your laptop is fully charged.
5,"Great pad, and durable, but a little too slim for most adults.","I love the way this shield is built, and the fact that it has many handles on its back for a wide range of workouts. However, its width makes the handles narrow for most adult hands. Also, it is not ideal for actual kicks because of its width. It is very hard to make contact with your shin and not have your foot wrap around the pad and hit the person holding it. Overall though, its sturdy and I have no desire to return it whatsoever."
3,Good Shield for the average Martial Arts person,"I bought this Kick Shield for my teenage son to practice with. It has held up pretty well for a couple of months. I like the various handles, but one of them seems to be already comming off. My son and his friends are pretty heavy users (5 days a week) of the shield so it maybe they over do it. Good for beginners or light users."
3,"Bland, timid, lacking all whimsy","This version of Ravel's opera about a spoiled child rebuked by his toys, furniture, and the animals living in and around the house needs a lot of style to come across as more than a precious frivolity. but colette meant her story seriously, and there is lots of poignancy to go along with Ravel's orchestral magic. There is one great performance on CD--the one on DG led by Maazel with all-French forces. This Previn is bland and dull, a walk-through with little or no magic."
4,Pretty decent!,"This product seems to deliver everything it promises. We installed the batteries, tested the system. It works great, the volume is pretty nice, yes, it will wake you up and the entire house can hear. So I rate this product very good."
3,Avarage at best,"Easy to use, load alarm, MOTION LIMITED RANGE (ONLY 5-10 ft) Alarm seems to be hard to set at times."
1,Cheap junk,"When I tried to assemble the alarm, I immediately noticed that I couldn't attach the mounting bracket to the alarm unit. The instructions said to screw the bracket into the hole in the bottom, but there were no threads, just a big hole. Upon closer inspection, I found that there was supposed to be a nut inside the hole, which was nowhere to be found. Thinking I might be able to work around that problem later, I decided to test the alarm, but the only thing it would do when tripped was flash the strobe light. It made no sound whatsoever. I promptly returned the item for a refund. If you're looking for a quality product, look elsewhere."
5,SB-40 Medicated Skin Cream,"I have used this skin cream for 5+ years. I work with my hands alot, i am a metal fab specialist with my employer, after several days of my hands being exposed to harsh materials, they begin to crack/split and then bleed. After several applications of this hand cream my hands start to heal rather quickly, and smooth to the touch, it does not leave any kind of greasy film on your hands or whatever area you use this on. The smell is no worse than some of the perfumed skin creams that most women use, IMHO i think this skin cream works better than some of those high dollar items. I would defintely recommend this item to anyone looking for relief with skin issues.SBS 40 MEDICATED SKIN CREAM 5 OZ TUBE"
1,medicated cream was a waste of my money,this was not a good product. It was very greasy and did not help me at all. I would not buy it again.
1,Smelliest cream ever,"I sent this product back after one use. I couldn't get the smell off my hands and no matter what the good properties of it were, there was no way I'd ever be able to stand the smell of it on me. Blech."
3,SBS 40 Medicated Hand Cream,"This product has only one flaw...the odor. It is a light, non-greasy medicated lotion, that absorbs quickly, but it has a strong, unpleasant odor. I ordered this product for my husband whose hands are dry and cracked from working outside in the cold weather. I always know when he has used the lotion because of the unpleasant odor. Otherwise, it is a very good product."
5,Best lotion ever!!!,"SBS 40 MEDICATED SKIN CREAM 5 OZ TUBEI've worked in the Water and Wastewater field for almost 40 years and have always had problems keeping my hands from cracking, splitting in the knuckle area and the constant roughness. I've tried countless brands of creams and lotions and then discoverd the SBS 40. This cream has worked miracles! I purchased enough for all my employees and they feel the same way. Many of them work with harsh chemicals that, in spite of gloves, still have adversely affected their hands. They love it too! Number one in our opinion!"
1,NOT AS GOOD AS AN IRON!!!,"Got this item for Christmas and have tried it several times. I get better results by using an iron. The sandwiches usually come out well overdone and smashed up. Doesn't actually cut the sandwiches as it appears, and good luck buying bread small enough to fit unit. Better to spend your money on a real sandwich press - or better yet, just use a pan and save the money."
1,longtivity,"put this little heater in the bath room of my old house where there was not heat it was great going into a 60 plus degree bath room instead of a 42 degree bathroom for 3 week anyways then it just died,"
3,It's okay,It doesn't heat as much as I'd like but its cheap and small. It heats through radiation so it will heat your hands but not a room.
3,Soldier heater,"Not too bad for what it suppose to do. It does not heat the entire room, but good for a desktop heater. My recommendation is if you want to heat up a room then get the bigger one. It was a good price for the product."
3,Dead within a month from purchase date,"Ever since I got this item, I've been using it 24/7. It was alive until yesterday, which got me to the point of purchasing more of this instead ofLasko 106 My Heat Personal Ceramic Heater, Purple. I loved this product. It's energy efficient and has good amount of warmth. Lasko's heater does blow cool air through its back, but this one doesn't have any of that cool air at all! (well, it's a dish heater after all)but it died, so I'm getting Lasko's ones instead. I used it (yeah, just one) for 24/7 for about a year and it's still alive."
1,Optimus H-4110 9-Inch Dish Heater is not very good,This Item is low quality. Heat is very very low. Its too expensvie for the money you pay. Its only for heat small small areas.
1,very disappointed,"This heater is small and not even good enough to heat a small room, such as a 10x10 area. Other then that the shipping was timely and the store provided the product as they said"
1,Great for two months!,Worked great for two months then it just stopped working. I would not recommend buying this heater. there is a warranty but it cost just as much to return under warranty as the cost of the heater. Not good.
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"At the $15 price I paid, this was fair value but I wouldn't pay more than that. Don't let the appearance fool you. It's not a parabolic heater which uses a gas-filled bulb like the Presto or the Soleus, it's a reflective heater with a standard electric coil - this means it takes longer to heat up and its effective heating area is much smaller. I wouldn't recommend this if your desired heating area is more than 15 square feet. If all you need is something close by your work desk or computer it'll do the job - because the reflector doesn't adjust upward it works better if you set it on something a foot or more off the floor."
2,Not too bad for its size,"I had a heat dish-type space heater that I purchased several years ago, and it worked great. Recently I saw this same heat dish style on internet so I ordered it. When I opened the box I was amazed to find the size was a lot smaller than I had expected it to be. None-the-less, for its small size it puts out enough heat to warm you if you are sitting right in front of it. It however does not do much for warming an entire room. I would only recommend this heater if you intend to use it for just up close heating."
5,Great heater for its size and power,"I just received this heater today, so I'm not 100% sure about it yet.Yes, this heater doesn't heat up as well as the bigger, pricier models because it's small and only uses 300watts. However, I think the heat it emits is almost comparable to the fan heater my roomate uses which uses 1500watts, 5x the power of this little heater. I think if I had 5 of these little ones, the room would become ~3x warmer than with the fan heater.Pros:-It's good for warming your feet and hands quickly-It's very portable-only 300watts (efficient for its power usage)-good priceCons:-Has a bit of a gaseous smell that my other roomate's dish heater doesn't emit...maybe because this one is so new?-Only a small area gets heated upOverall, I'm happy with it."
2,Too weak...,"I gotta admit... I didn't know it was a miniature size of a dish heater. It is small. Measure 9 inches to see how small the dish is.Considering the size, it packs a punch but still it's nowhere near adequate to heat a room. The best usage is perhaps put it under a desk to warm your feet and lower body.If you are considering a dish heater, buy a regular size one. By the way... Dish heaters are not for night-time heating purpose. I think they too bright to left them on when you go to sleep. For that, get an oil heater. They are for spot heating and if that's all you need, they do excellent job."
2,Weak,"Just not warm enough. Thought it'd be a good under desk heater but it wasn't the case. Could be the radiant aspect of it not being able to penetrate sneakers and jeans. But since I prefer not to work naked, I replaced with a small ceramic unit that does the trick."
4,Its very useful,"This heat is for small places or small areas that does not cover by conventional heat. For me, I put it close to the babies changer and its very useful."
3,Optimus H-4110 Heater,"Very light weight. Won't use it when grandkids are around. Would not recommend around pets, either. Just ok for a back up heater."
1,V-E-R-Y Limited radius of heating,"This stayed in my possession 24 hours - a quick turnaround back to the UPS center for return. First off, I couldn't make the 'head' stay up, even after tightening the screw. But the most important, the only object it would heat was the only thing it was facing: one of my chair's legs. That's it. Nothing else.That said, the security feature which turns to element off with every suspicious move is very good point for the security conscious. Of course, that 'suspicious move' included the head of the heater leaning forward - as the screw wouldn't hold it, hence my inability to use it.Don't waste your time nor your money."
1,Too Underpowered,"This unit looks just like it's bigger brother, but doesn't put out enough heat, even when positioned a foot or two away."
1,Stopped working in 3 months,"Stopped working in less than 3 months.Poor quality, should have lasted longer, at least a year or two.Plus it is really a real small unit."
2,small areas only,I regret buying this.it works fine but it sure wont heat a regular sized room.300 watts 2011 technology only warms a small place like bathroom but even thenat least its silentit will make the whole room warm in maybe 24+ hours
3,Does what is expected - for a while,"The first heater lasted a year. The power switch died as an open. The element itself is OK.While it worked, it was ideal for keeping feet warm sitting at a desk.Eventually, I will find a replacement switch, but the utility of the heater is so great that I am ordering a replacement."
2,Broken in a year.,"I bought this one last year. I usually left it under my desk. It's fine except the heat didn't disperse well. However, it went bad today. The power light is still on but no heating. I don't average life for a heat. But one year is little bit short to me."
2,Not worth it.,"This Optimus radiant heat dish (9 inch diameter)was easy to start.. However the heat output- radiant- is very minimal. You have to sit about 2-3 ft away from it to feel the warmth.More then 3 ft distance and you won't more then when you would have turned the Optimus off. It only warms part of your body. If the ""beam of heat"" is aimed at your waist,your waist will get warm. Rest of your body stays cold. It's a funny feeling. UPS just came by to ship the item back to Amazon.The good thing about this heater is that it's rated 300 Watt. My computer under the desk actually keeps me warmer then this product.Just keep the door to your -small- home office closed and your room will -eventually- warm up thanks to your computer and monitor and other office equipment."
4,Optimus 9-inch Dish Heater,"I have to say i am very pleased with this heater since it does the job what it was intended to do. When you first turn it on it does take a bit for the full heat this will put out, but after that its quite hot and you can feel the heat floating out of the front. Now at 300 watts don't expect it warm a large room but it will keep the temperature warm in a 10 x 10 room easy enough with time and keep it that way as long as you do not have a bad draft where you have lousy or no insulation, but all in all this is a great product would recommend it to anyone."
4,"No thermostat -- otherwise, it's ideal for its purpose.","The lack of a thermostat is the only negative about this product. The positives:1) No fan means it's silent.2) The parabolic reflector directs the heat just where you want it.3) Only 300 watts means a great saving in electric bills.4) This is intended to heat a corner of a room or some other small space. Why pay to heat an entire room if you don't need to?5) The purchase price is very attractive.6) The heater was delivered promptly and in perfect condition.Of course, all heaters must be used with caution. Read the enclosed safety instructions and heed them."
4,Very useful heater for very small spaces,"Quite a lot of heat for such a compact gadget. I have an old house w/ no heating vent in the bathroom, and plugged into a GFI outlet, this works very well. Only flaw is that heat won't reach anything moe than a few feet away."
4,heater,"I use this heater in my bathroom. It doesn't actually heat the room, but does knock the chill off. It feels great to stand in front of just after getting out of the shower."
3,stopped working,"Initially I loved this little heater. Stands about a foot high and fit under my desk at work perfectly. Completely silent and created a nice cocoon of warmth under the desk area. Would not work well in an open space but worked beutifully in my small cubicle area.BUT it just stopped working... The little light indicating it is on is lit, but no heat. I used nearly every day for almost 10 months (super cold, non adjustable AC in my office, so I used it year round). I am assuming the heating coil snapped. If it was a more expensive item, I would look into fixing it, but as it is only $20, its not really worth the cost to fix it."
4,good little heater...,"I was looking for a good little heater for one room in my house and this is the perfect one...yeah, if you use it in a big area, it's ineffective, but what do you really expect?I really didn't want a 1500 watt waste of power heater, so this little 300 watt one is perfect for my needs. It will heat a small room slowly without an issue and it has decent safety features. In addition, it's safe around kids and pets (no dangerous fumes or anything). Oh, at 300 watts, it also won't raise your energy bill like the bigger ones...I like this little heater...it gets the job done...and for the price, it's a no-brainer.Enjoy your little piece of warmth!"
4,Works well enough,"I bought this product to go under my desk in my garage, I was hoping it would keep my feet warm on those cold nights. It does the job well enough and has a nice safety feature underneath it so it shuts off if the base comes off the ground."
2,"I really can't express what a waste of money this heater is :-{ I love Amazon, but I don't like this heater","I did research and compared heaters, I took my time and I thought ""OPTIMUS"" brand and this particular heater was the right choice for me. I bought it last winter 12/2011 & it worked fine. I pulled it out this winter 12/2012 & it DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! In total I bought three (3) OPTIMUS brand heaters last winter and all three have stopped working after one(1) season of use. :-{"
4,Useful,"You have to be close, like around three or four feet, but then it does provide significant warmth. I use it when sitting at my desk. It won't heat a room, you have to be near it for it to work. Pluses are silent operation, low consumption of electricity, and reasonable cost. Worth having."
4,Optimus H-4110,This unit does well in a small space or if you are in front of it. It service it purpose.
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM,"BUY THE 400W INSTEAD ! I had a 400w/800w and it worked SO MUCH better. This one is just half size of the 400W and produces almost no heat unless you sit in front of it. If you sit more than 1 foot away from it, you won't feel any heat at all while the 400W can burn me if i stay 4 feet or more away from it. I want to return this item but don't want to pay for shipping it back. Unlucky me ! This is really a waste of money and electricity. Spend another 100W for heat and you'll get much much better heat !"
2,Almost Worthless,"I was hoping this heater would heat my very small bathroom but in fact it doesn't heat anything but a tiny area within 3 inches of the heater. I have amended my review because when it isn't too cold, the heater makes a decent foot warmer."
3,Not infrared,"Note: This is not an infrared heater, just a electric coil heater. It is a cute little heater and will heat my water heater closet very well. I have an on-demand water heater and it can freeze."
3,dish heater,this item is a smaller version of one I have in my basement. it was not as good and needs to be closer to feel.Better on a desk next to you if you want it.
3,It's okay,I did not read this well enough. It is not really what I wanted. But it is well worth what I paid.
1,Lasted one season,I was only able to use this heater for one season before it suddenly stopped working.The on/off light comes on but the element no longer heats.
4,Great little heater,"This little heater is safe, quiet, and efficient. I trust this heater to run constantly and it has not affected my electric bill. Be warned this heater is basically for heating a small room or bathroom."
3,Good for face,Only usefull for heating the face and some small part not fot other use. It does not rotate is just a resistance.
5,Great for heating small areas efficiently,"Initially I thought it had a short but the ""tip sensor"" is just a button on the bottom and my floor was uneven!its awesome if you want to heat up your feet or something small without heating the whole room.5 stars!"
2,Not good for room or office!,"While these are very quiet heaters, they don't really work to warm up a room. You don't feel the warm, unless you are sitting right next to it. They don't heat up even a small room or office. I had better luck with the Lasko and the Holmes small ones with fans. I just got the small grey Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater and it works great, the cost is the same as this one (twenty bucks) excellent job at warming up my 12'x12' room. Also the small Holmes HFH416 with temp. settings is a very good one. Links to both,LASKO>>>>>Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater with Adjustable ThermostatHOLMES>>>>>Holmes HFH416 1-Touch Swirl Grill Power Heater"
4,Be prepared to hug it..,"Not because its cuddly and soft, but because this thing will not ""reach"" far if youre in a very cold room. I live in Central New York with only nominally working central heat which keeps the rooms above 45 at best, and this thing will work from maybe 3-5 feet away, probably better if it were closer, or if the temperature wasnt so terribly cold. However, with the low power consumption, I dont have to worry about it tripping the breakers or killing my wallet come the utility bill, when my desktop power supply uses more power than this thing!"
2,Not Powerful Enough to be Useful,"This heater is only 300 watts, which while good for your electric bill, is not good for warming you up. Of that 300 watts of heat, roughly 30-40% of it goes straight up. The rest of the heat is radiated. Unfortunately, the heat is not hot enough. If you have the heater about 1 foot away, it might keep your legs warm, but not the rest of your body."
2,thought $19.99 was a good deal but....,went to target and they had 2 space heaters for $30!tested this heater out by putting brie cheese right in front of it...18 minutes later its a tad bit soft but not even melted!you have to be literally 6 inches away to feel the heat
1,"Doesn't Work, Not Even For A Small Bathroom",I live in a mobile home and my bathroom is so small that I have to sit on the toilet to close the bathroom door to get the shower behind it. This heater doesn't even heat that much space. at all.
3,Not Very Warm,"It's understandably not the highest quality for its size, but it is the cheapest heater I've found and it isn't terrible though. It's condition was really nice when I received it as well."
2,Heats a closet maybe,"Has just one setting, (ON/OFF). Its small (9"" as stated). Better plan on putting this on your desk, or right infront of your face, cuz it puts out very little heat. That all I bought it for, but its Dec. now in VA and this thing may not cut it through the winter. Spend a little more and get a good one!"
3,For Small Areas Only,"I use this heater in my bathroom which is about 3' x 6'. There isn't enough room for a heater bigger than this one, without it being a complete hazard. Even with this one we have to be careful. It heats the room quick enough, so for what we are using it for, it's good. It would not serve well in a room any bigger, unless you sat or stood directly in front of it. Even then it would only warm one spot of about a 1-2' radius."
3,Not the best.,"I bought this for a little heater for when my room gets a chill to it, Foolish move? yes, why? i bought this heater because my sister has one of same size (Different brand) so i figured i could use one to considering hers can make you sweat... this heater is more for a bathroom and small areas as it says on the box which i did not know, yes it can make a neat little desk heater for your face but that is the most it will do. Dont make the same mistake i did and think this is for a bedroom which it clearly is not.It would be much better to spend about $10 to $20 dollars more on another model instead of this one, such a small price change will make a HUGE difference.As for the heater rating, this heater give off a heat radius of about 6 to 8 inch's outward from the heater, Mainly meant to change the temperature in the moisture (Such as a bathroom). The heater can heat up quite quickly considering its size as i saw most complained about how long it can take to heat up, there wrong."
2,heater,I did not like the item. I think it was defective so I returned it. Still debating on what to get next.
3,does yours have a removable cover?,"I bought one at [...]. 16'' Presto. Works fine, except the front grill is non-removable. Any dust or pet hair in your home?..requires a small feather duster to clean. Without cleaning, heat capacity is greatly diminished. Bathroom humidity makes cleaning harder.These work great, but should be better designed for cleaning."
3,Great when it works!,"unfortunately for me I had to return this and get a replacement because it broke down within 2 months. But during the time it was working, it did fairly well for a small dish and 300 watts!If this one breaks down too, I'm going to re-edit my review"
2,Nice while it lasted,"Nice while it lasted, but it died after a couple of months.This is more of a personal warmer than a room heater. Good under your desk, about a foot away from your body, but not very useful otherwise. Creates no noise while in use."
2,Very Small Disc-Small Heat,"I've owned a parabolic heater in the past. Holmes was the brand but they are not making them any longer.This is just too small a heater to heat anything other than an enclosed area about 5'x5'. As in a cubicle.It is also very lightweight, as in too lightweight, you knock it over if you just bump it with your foot, and since it's so small it's real easy not to see. I returned mine the day after I received it. Going to try the Quartz Radiant box type made by the same company, Optimus!"
1,worked well for about 2 hrs then died,"i was initially pleased with this heater, until it died... it gave us about 2 hours of service before it gave out on us. had it worked, i would have given it 4 stars for concept, size, general cuteness, heating power, safety features (heat turns off if unit is not completely level). the 4-versus-5 star would have been for the fact that heat is not adjustable, is simply on/off.however given that it doesn't work... 1 star seems generous enough."
4,thermal fuse,"I have four of these heaters which run 24/7 during the winter. I have had two quit after a couple of years. The source of the problem is a thermal safety fuse located behind the reflector. It is rated at 113 C, so it doesn't take a lot of overheating to trip it. It is easily replaced from digitec or newark. I suspect either it was running on a warm day or too close to something to cause the failure. It is a sefuse sf113E if you need to replace it. Otherwise the heaters are great and I would prefer that they shut down prematurely rather than catching something on fire."
1,Virtually useless.,This product works great if you want to have it less than a foot from your leg.End of story.
4,heater,"I love the color and the service was great, product arrived very quickly and was still in tact... thanks for great service!"
3,small,I guess I wasn't paying enough attention to the size description. My bad. The picture makes it look bigger than it is but it does the job for the size I suppose.
3,Effective until it died,"I bought this in December, 2010. I've used it under my desk at work and it worked well in that it kept my feet and legs warm. But unfortunately it just died yesterday, about 14 months after I bought it and of course two months after the warranty expired."
4,from a satisfied customer,Its good for the price and to warm up a small room. But it would have been better if it swivels like an oscillating fan so that the heat is distributed around the room.
4,More rockin' on this one.,"(1978) 9th studio release ""No Smoke Without Fire"", things changed a little, they became more of a rock 'n' roll band, dropping some of their folk flavor. ""NSWF"", was their first not to chart since their debut in 1970. The album begins with the rocker ""You See Red"", ""Baby The Angels Are Here"". ""Ships In The Sky"", the WA progressive sound of ""Stand And Deliver"" and ""The Way Of The World Parts 1 and 2"". They would release ""Just Testing"", in 1980."
4,Love those twin guitars...,"I should start by saying that my two favorite Ash albums are New England and There's The Rub. Those would be 5/5 stars in my book. This one is great also, but in my opinion, lacks a bit of the character and mystique that made the previously mentioned albums so amazing. ""Ships in the Sky"" is straight out of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. ""You See Red"" has a riff that sticks in the brain for days, and ""The Way of the World"" is a mini-epic that has a cool break between Parts I and II. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you like twin guitar harmonies (see ""Stand and Deliver""). There are a couple of weaker tracks, but all in all, this is still a solid, quality rock album."
2,For at least trying,"But they tried WAY TO HARD to supercede Front Page News and to make it MORE SUCCESSFUL. Failed at both attempts! This was a big slump period for the band at this point in time. In fact most of these songs when performed live, HAD the intense fire, these studio versions lacked. 'Way of the World' scorched everytime I heard it live, but on No Smoke Without Fire, well it was a smouldering flicker. This was one of their biggest letdowns with Laurie Wisefield on second guitar. The live tracks included here (Lorelei) are nice but are hardly indicative of what 'couldve been', if that energy was put to better use for this project."
2,not very good...,i read this for almost an hour. don't bother reading it. i've read several outlines in this vien and i'm not catholic.
2,Weak,"I kept asking myself why? There are so many other good books out there - why did I get this one? The story had potential, but I just couldn't like the hero or heroine. By the time you get to the big breakup before the big happily ever after you just don't care."
5,Short but Sweet,"The title may say ""abc"", but all military aviation buffs will love this little guy. This British 64 page paperback was written in 1960 to counteract wartime propaganda that Axis aircraft were below par. The write ups are a model of objectivity and brevity with essential technical information. There are over 30 major types of aircraft in the first half, and over 30 minor aircraft in the remainder. The major types, of course, include the Me-109, Fw-190 and Fiat models. The minor types include the less known Heinkels, Junkers and Fiats. There is no flag waving or flag burning in this book, only the facts."
5,Great watch but...,"I just recieved my brand new Tag heuer and it's amazing! like others TH watches, but it didn't come with International Warranty Card, so I can't go outside USA cause if my watch get damage I can't do anything with it. The bad news is that in fact I did not live at USA, so I have to pray so much...PD: that's my 2nd Tag Heuer Watch and NEVER HAVE happen anything about it's quality, even I do live beside the sea."
2,its hard to belive its swiss made,"When i bought this watch , having in mind what tag heuer stand for...racing, chronographs... i have to tell you that this watch has not a back lite, very usefull tool, in low light you wont see anynthing!, it can only mesure 1 hour 59 min and 59 sec and 99 after that it will mesure 23 hour min and second BUT NOT ""centecimals"", if you want a complete swiss made watch elegant that can do this and more with back lite and everything needed go after Accutron telluride, or eco drive promaster by citizen !this is the first time that im going to give to my favorite watch brand 3 stars, very, very dissapointed at tag heuer, and this particular watch."
4,Bosca is great - mostly GOODs and a few BADs,"Bosca products are well-made and look just fantastic. So I'm pleased I got this item.GOOD* hooks are strong, swivel in any direction, and are easy to open (intentionally) but will not come open unintentionally* leather, stitching, edging are all top notch. soft, beautiful, professional-looking* light* size is good - they really made it as compact as they could. feels good in the pocket. Got rid of the ""keyring feel"" in the pocket, which was my intent.BAD* one of the hooks is much bigger - still haven't figured that one out* the keys hang ever so slightly below the bottom edge of the leather ... VERY slightly - i.e., the hooks are too long* the valet hook - not sure what the meaning of this was, it just gets in the way and my impression is that the first thing everyone does is take it off. it only adds to the weight/bulk of the holder in your pocket"
3,a handy but expensive key holder,"this is a handy item. i had the same item which i used for years {until it was completely thread bare}. it was much cheaper then. for its $60 price, this one doesn't smell or feel as if it were real leather. worse, the keys keep getting unhooked and falling loose into my pocket or onto the floor. i may have to add crazy glue to the clasp once the keys are hooked on."
3,Tight Design,"Bosca makes exquisite leather items. However, the design of this key case is too tight for modern car keys, and the case is unnecessarily thick in the pocket even with normal flat keys. I would love to keep it for the fragrant top-grade leather, but it is just impractical."
5,The best humoristic group in quebec,"This is by far the best show on tv and definitely the funnyest. Watching it today and im still amazed by how it aged well and is even better then wath is playing now. Me and my brother used to watch this show religiously when it played and we know all the sketches ans songs by hart.I dont think that anyone is the u.s.a will relate to this show thaugh since its all inside jokes about politics - music - tv (etc ,etc) in or around Quebec. Highly recommended."
3,"Great in many ways, but concerning","I am a voice person, I both perform singing and have been teaching for years. I have been a Josh Groban fanatic ever since his first CD, and I have been hungry for his latest one to come out. I admit there are many things on the CD I like: Josh's general style and choice of music, but I am concerned after listening to this CD several times that Josh seems to be ""straining"" his voice for the first time. Several of the songs seem to be pushing the limits of his comfortable range, and I could be wrong but it seems like he is trying to make a more ""pop"" sound. I hope not. This would be a grave mistake and lead his beautiful voice down the road of many others who were seduced by the dark side. . . Josh take care of your beautiful voice!! Don't listen to anybody but yourself! Sigh. . . Here's hoping for more great Josh CDs. . ."
3,AWAKE,I was a little disappointed in this cd. The selections did not move me.I have another of Josh Groban's albums and I enjoy that much better than this one.
3,Not as powerful performance as past CD's,"Although another great vocal performance, his song selections are not up to expectations set by previous CD's from the performer. The accompanying short (33 minute) DVD is not worth the additional price. Reccommend vocal CD purchase only."
4,It's a Trade Off,"Out there is a CD only and a CD/DVD version of the Awake Tour-Live (2 discs.) Both CDs have yelling, squealing, and whistling young ladies (at least I think they are young. I'm 53 yrs old & I leave my squealing for Josh at home.) It's a toss-up (I ended up buying both.) The CD with the DVD has 9 songs. The CD alone has 13 songs. Interestingly The CD (alone) doesn't have ""Awake."" Also, the CD alone doesn't have ""Pearls."" The CD alone has songs that aren't on the DVD/CD. They are ""You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)"", ""L'Ultima Notte"", ""Solo Por Ti"", ""Now or Never"",""Un Giorno Per Noi (Romeo E Giulietta)"",& ""Lullaby"". I bought the CD/DVD 1st & then saw that more songs were on the CD alone. Hopefully this review helps you to decide whether you want one or both of the available Awake packages. I suppose that you may have some of the missing songs from another source. I gave this 4 stars because the DVD has those missing songs."
2,Awake-Groban,The music is to the ear well done but it does not move me therefore it bored me. This man has a beautiful voice but the collection lacked pizzazz so I was disappointed.
4,Josh Groban -- Awake,Josh Groban's vocal style continues to grow in depth and expression. I especially enjoyed the diversity on this CD that included African musicians and their music.
1,DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT IT CAN RUIN YOUR CONCRETE,I used this product on my concrete driveway and it completely ruined the driveway. It literally took the top layer off. The company refuses to pay for the damage that was done.
5,If You Love Me You Will Follow,"The magic in this book is the tug at the reader's heartstrings as one's own childhood memories are evoked through the telling of the author's family story. With a masterful control of detail and setting, Mr. Girard draws the reader into each episode. Then, having drawn us in, we take a wonderfully poignant journey through the fun and foibles of a family that is both ordinary and extraordinary. This is truly delightful reading for all but especially for the generation who lived through the 1930's and 1940's and for those of us who are their children."
4,Summer on Wheels,Two boys hector and mando go on a bike ride. they get to film a commercialand they get attacked by a gang.My favorite parts are when they are filming a commercial and when they are in the museum preteanding to be statues.I recommend this book for people who speak spanish and English because it has both languages.This bookis a very good book for bike riders who speak Spanish and English.
3,Summer on Wheels by: Gary soto,"can you imagine going on a bike trip, surfing, or being attacked by a gang? How about going to a paintball war or turning your boring but smart cousin into a cool kid?Well; get ready to do all of thatin Hector and Mando's bike trip in Summer on Wheels.I recommend this book to everyone but this book has some spanish words in it, but in the back of the book."
3,summer on weels,"have you ever been told a scary story in a cemetery? Well if you do then, you are going to like this book because Hector and Mando go on a bike trip and they find lots of adventures.I liked the paintball war because Sarah is a girl and she made gthe last shot. They won the game because of sarah.I recommend this book to anyone who likes paintball or who speaks spanish and understands it because it's about kids that speak spanish.Read the book because it's got a lot of adventure"
3,Summer on Wheels,"Have you ever been the millionth attendee at a sporting event and won lots of prizes? If you want to know the rest of Hectors and Mando's adventures, read the book Summer on Wheels.The part that I most Enjoyed was when they went to paint-ball because I liked to go paint-balling to.I recommend this to all Spanish people because it has some Spanish words.This book was pretty good but it wans't the best because the book wasn't that interesting to me."
4,Overall a book worth reading,"This book started out great. By telling the story of his life, Franklin then showed how the Black Church influenced his life. From that part he described the various ways in which the Black Church has dealt with the American mainstream. However, the book then went into a totally different track by discussing how churches can use foundations to create change. It almost becasme a how-to in getting money from foundations. It was this part that confused me as to the overall point of the book."
1,it took strength to watch this!,"The point of many ""hood flicks"" is that ""if you lie down with dogs, you gon' get up with fleas."" This shows a jewelry heist gone wrong.Part of me wants to put this under ""so bad it's good,"" but I can't. As a low-budget flick, you can expect poor acting, close to no props, bad timing, narrow range for the camera, inter alia. But what stands out is all the fake dying. It's worse that what you would see on an old ""Dr. Who"" episode. All kinds of people are shot with guns here, but not one single victim ever bleeds.There's even some drag here. These hard-featured dudes couldn't pass as female in real life for nothing, yet in this film all it takes is a cheap ho'e's wig and they suddenly are read as female.To the film's credit, it tries to have double and triple crosses to be challenging. Still, this is mess in a dress!"
1,Item not recived,"This is not the first time I didn't recive an item.Tracking number must be mandatory in all shipiing, specially in international shipping."
1,"If you like burnt rice, this is the one for you!","From the first day we have owned this cooker, it has burnt the rice on the bottom, every time. Our previous cooker, which we owned and used a couple times a week for over 20 years, worked great! It was a National brand (aka Panasonic). Our college son now has it, and still uses it, so we're stuck with the burnt rice."
3,Misleading description,"I was under the impression the inner rice holder would be stainless steel, but it was Teflon. The stainless steel piece was for steaming food, so it is quite misleading to call this product a ""stainless steel rice cooker"". I am planning to return this item as a result."
1,Looking for another cooker,"I have this cooker and am looking for another one. It burns the rice on the bottom every time, no matter what I do. Also, I agree with the person who was disappointed that there was no 2 cup mark--I don't need to make 4 cups every time."
4,Gets the Job Done,"Overall I am quite satisfied with this rice cooker. I was initially attracted to it because of the Stainless Steel element in the description, I had thought that it was refering to the actual pot before I purchased it, but it is describing only the exterior of the unit. However, I was still not disapointed as the pot itself is of a heavier material and has a durable nonstick coating better than the standard aluminum versions which are light and uncoated.The only disapointment I have is that there is always a layer of slightly overcooked rice at the bottom of the pot. If you unplug the unit right after it has finished cooking, this layer is never burnt, but nonetheless it is not fluffy in texture like the rest of the rice.Overall I feel it is a reliable product from price to finish."
4,Wonderful Rice Cooker,"I have a friend who has this same rice cooker who bought it, I belive, from your web site. She is always raving about how she can't go wrong with the rice. So I borrowed it last week for a dinner party my husband and I were having and it was wonderful. The rice was very moist and fluffy. So I now have to buy my own. Thanks for carrying such great product."
1,Used it 2 times and it died,"Unit just died yesterday, smelled something burning and it wasn't the rice. My main gripe was there was no 2 cup mark. The smallest amount that was imprinted on the pan was 4 cups."
3,"It works, but I'm going to replace mine","This unit is average as far as I can tell. If you are just making rice, then the unit works acceptably. It will burn the rice on the bottom everytime, but the rest of the rice will be fine. If you are cooking rice and steaming vegtables, the unit works just as well, but the veggies will be overcooked. If you are just steaming vegetables, the unit stinks. It is impossible to keep the unit turned on. It keeps turning itself off after the first few minutes."
2,"great rice, but not durable...","Yes, I bought this rice cooker and the rice came out perfect, except for the fact that the cooker died within a month, after only about 8 uses. I would try another brand."
5,Easy to Use and Great Tasting!!!,"I received this rice cooker as a house warming gift a few years ago. When i first got it I thought that I would neveer use it and it would sit in my cupboaard. It truns out taht I use this more than twice a week!! Its so easy to use and even easier to clean. Rice doenst stick to the machine like it does when I cook on the stove. In addition, I can set it and worry about preparing other parts of my meal or do whatever it is I have to do instead of watching it and stirring every 2 minuites. I reccomend this to anyone anywhere!"
5,MAKES RICE COOKING VERY EASY,THIS RICE COOKER WORKS VERY WELL COMPARED TO OTHERS OUT THERE. ESPECIALLY SALTON RICE COOKER WHICH IS A TOY RICE COOKER. BUY FARBERWARE RICE COOKER ALWAYS. THEY ARE THE BEST.
2,Not Durable,"This product is the 2nd one that we had in the past year. It only looks nice, but doesn't last."
4,10 Cup Rice Cooker - Farberware,"The cooker cooks well and you can steam vegtables on the stainless steel top insert. The rice pot is aluminum with teflon coating, no stainless here. I have had this product for a couple of years and when I am in the mood for rice dishes it performed well. Will keep the rice warm when finished cooking, best to use the rice soon therafter for best results."
2,Farberware rice cooker,"My previous rice cooker of over 20 years began wearing out so I purchased the Farberware based on the companies' reputation. Every time I use it, the rice browns on the bottom. This is frustrating and I am ready to donate this one and go back to the oriental brand I had in the past."
2,Nonstick is nice; poor reliability.,"My experience mirrors others; it died after about a two years, although it went unused for about 15 months of that. The nonstick basket is nice and easy to clean, but the consequent brittle rice around the border makes the cooker unsuitable for making only a small amount of rice."
2,It Died After 1 Year,"Well quite disapointed with this rice cooker> To begin with, the button that pushes down to go from warm to cook after a while stopped staying down and had to be forced to stay down with scotch tape and in turn the rice cooker had to be baby sat as not to over cook the rice. Since. Had no choice. And now as of two days ago and a year of use, It will not even turn on. No power at all. The power cord is fine, even ran around the house to make sure it was not the electrical outlets. It was not. It just died. Is it worth fixing or is it just the natural life span of a ... rice cooker? Time to move up in the world to one that does not use a common push down button destined to wear itself out, reason for the tape. But no power?"
4,Cooks well; easy to clean,"I have used this rice cooker to cook many kinds of grain for about 10 years. Yes, when you cook small amounts the rice on the bottom gets overcooked; but the nonstick finish on the inner pan makes that issue nothing more than an inconvenience. I find this one of the most useful cooking tools I have ever had. If you buy one, don't forget that you can use this cooker to cook more than just steamed rice. One of my favorite recipes: saute a leek in a little olive oil RIGHT IN THE POT, then add kasha and water; sprinkle with salt & cook. Wonderful one-pot elegant dish. I've also cooked soup, oatmeal, etc. Check out the little cookbook that comes with it for more ideas."
5,Works as described,Easy to install. Packaging was great.Useful to have three light settings.Would recommend to others.Great value and product!
1,Does not work!!!,I bought this product as I was visiting the UK and it was cold there.This made no difference on my flaking.It just did not work for me.And I used it about 4 times hoping that I would have seen a difference.As I said before I saw no change.
4,Floor mats,"Appear to be very well made and a good design. Most impressive is the 10 year warranty. Also, the product is American made."
4,title of review,"The best new metalcore band I've heard in a long time. This band's music totally belies their trendy prettyboy image. This is what Dark Tranquillity's new album should have sounded like. The Kings Collapse is an all-out death metalcore assault. Our Great Deceiver takes a little bit of influence from Dillinger Escape Plan's spazzy techy style too. The flamenco intro to Return To Grandeur is blah, the song doesn't really get good until the vocals kick in at the 2:30 mark. The soft non-metal opening to Nepenthe is interesting. Erelong is almost pure metal, a conscoious effort to get away from their hardcore influences maybe, but they still come through in the rhythm of the riffs a bit."
3,For Kennedy scholars,"This collection of spoken and written witticisms uttered by former President Kennedy is collected from campaign speeches, press conferences, and other public appearances as well as a few letters.I suppose that had I been alive during the era in question, or were I more of a political scholar I would have found these bon mots more amusing. Unfortunately, my parents hadn't even met at the time, and I have little frame of reference for the people and institutions which were the target for Kennedy's humorous statements. My favorite, however, is something Kennedy said in Minneapolis about being ready to debate with Nixon, as he'd just had a go-round with Hubert Humphrey, and felt well-prepared by that exchange. As a Minnesotan, one can't help be familiar with Mr. Humphrey!I would recommend this book mostly for Kennedy fans and political scholars."
4,The Kennedy Wit,A cute book that reminds readers (especially those of us born after his death) that our country has had Presidents who were both competent and charismatic.
3,Copy but at least I found it,"I had been looking for this cd for years and I was lucky to find it at amazon. The cd is a copy , not the original cd but Im pleased anyway."
2,"Boring, boring, boring ...","Well, it was pretty boring. The whole cop chase scene was silly, and the dude on the front of the bike trick was lame. I watched it once and it has just gathered dust since. As I haven't burned this one, I guess it may be worth a viewing if your bored."
5,KICK SHEILDS,"BUY THESE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTTED, THEY HOLD UP TO THE HARDEST KICKS AND LAST. I RUN A MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL AND HAVE TRYED MANY PADS. THIS IS THE ONLY PAD I BUY NOW. THICK AND HARD. GREAT FOR BOTH KICKER AND HOLDER. SHIPPING WAS ALSO GOOD. TURN AROUND TIME FROM WHEN I ORDERD THEM WAS 4 DAYS, BUY THEM YOU WILL AGREE."
3,"Some Nuggets - Same Ideas as previous books, but applied.","I like the overall tone of this book, as I am a real advocate of his earlier works with discovering & developing one's strengths. For me, however, it was largely recycled ideas - albeit good ones!The best nuggest I got (so far - I'm still reading parts) is that great managers play chess rather than checkers with their people. That is, in chess, you have to know each particular piece - how each one moves & performs in a different way. In checkers, you treat all pieces the same regardless. Perfect analogy, which I will use in my classes & for clients!"
5,adopting the system to the individual so the system can work,"My Profile: 42 yo (2006) Sales Enginner.This is an inetersting book on recognizing the power of the individual who is either an employee or a customer. Mr. Buckinghanm takes us in an inetresting plot to reveal those ultimate principles we should hold on to to assure maximum sucess in a chaostic world.Some of his theses are very counterintuitive, at least in a society such as Venezuela where only the top managers or the owners are allowed to think while employees are mindless hands. To make it extreme the leadership of everted by the actual leader of the demagogic-militaristic regime thats in poiwer can be attributed to the principle of leadership described here, where the simplistic power of the message that answers- who do we have to serve? can explain the irrational back up given to the dictatorial thug."
1,It's not ONE thing...it's many,"The title is misleading...it's not one thing, it's many...and the many things the author cites are rehashed wisdom and experience, though he does present them in a succinct way. This book is for management junkies, not serious people looking for practical strategies to improve their and their team's performance. This is one more example of the superficial competition to fill your bookshelves with passed on wisdom. Better to roll up your sleeves and just DO IT!"
1,The one thing you need to know..,dont waste your money on this.Just a collection of boring anecdotes.
5,Excellent,Excellent material. Very well structured and has all the new ideas and approaches for leadership and management. It defines both concepts with good examples and makes it easy to understand the difference between leadership and management. I enjoyed every page.
3,Just ok,"This book had a few nuggets of goodness, but overall, it wasn't insightful enough to hold my attention. I didn't even finish it. It's full of a lot of common sense principles--nothing innovative or profound."
4,"To be a better leader, read this book!","A great leader is one of the greatest attributes anyone can attain in life. Whether you manage a team, run a small or large corporation, leadership is a needed quality to run a more effective business and a more enjoyable life. Great leaders need to read this book and apply the principles to improve their leadership skills.Rebecca D. Turner author of ""Tattoo"" a business book, read it-grow your business-enjoy your life!!Tattoo"
2,One thing you need to know about this book,"One thing you need to know about this book is that it is extremely wordy and contains little substance to justify a 280 page book. Mostly, the author writes what are seemingly useless paragraphs to meander from the focal point of the book: just what is the that one ""thing"" you should know? For example, the author compares three movies, and concludes that one of the movie was annoying because it didn't answer the question of ""what is the meaning of life"". I didn't find his wanna-be movie critic analysis useful, intriguing, or entertaining.Let me save you some money by saying that one thing you should know is to understand your and others' strengths and capitalize on that strength by making it even stronger and utilizing it as much as possible. Everyone should focus on the strengths, not weaknesses."
4,needs bigger push button,"Works as advertised, but I wish it were substantially brighter. It would be nice if the control button were bigger, also."
4,blinkey lights,"affordable and shipped quickly and lights work great, small but bright enough, easy to mount and many mounting mentods, good value, glad to have easy to use lights on my bike"
1,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this item having read the reviews and didn't expect much. I wasn't disappointed. It came with very few directions which I had to look for on the side panels. There are no directions on the battery placement, so I guessed, and was correct. Up to this point I figured, okay, the reviews were right, cheap but it works. The lights tested fine. About 20 minutes into my ride the front light stopped working. When I got home I pulled the battery and replaced it with a new American made $4.50 battery and it works again. Now I will have to wait and see how long the back light works on the ""Made in China"" battery."
2,Not Good For Daytime Safety,"I purchased these for my commute to work during daylight hours. I travel along two lane roads that have lots of shadows due to trees. My concern has been that with the right angle of sunlight, a driver will over look me.For my purpose, these LEDs are just not bright enough nor do they have enough spread for day time riding. Even riding at dusk or on cloudy days through shadows, the LEDS just dont put out enough light where I felt as though drivers could see me. I returned these and purchased the more expensive three LED Planet Bike for the rear, and the Blackburn Quadrant for the front. Its 4x the price, but probably whats needed."
1,"White light, Red light, no light","I agree with other reviews that the white light is really not a headlight by any means.I attached the red light in the back so others can see me. At first it worked fine in both blinking and constant mode. Last week it would only work in constant mode and only if I pressed the button really hard. Today it would turn on as long as I pressed the button . However , I can't ride the bike whit my right hand behind my back pressing the button. I put a new battery and it would not work. In a moment of inspiration I shook it and the light turned on. So, I though I was safe and sound driving to work. However, when I got off my bike at work, the light was dead.I do not need to spend $$ to ride like a darkturd."
4,good deal for the money,"Nice little light set. You'd pay 3x-4x as much in a bike shop. Work well. Comes with different fittings to attach to almost any part of any bike. Batteries ARE included. (Really!!)Now for the bad news. Instructions require a microscope to read. If you've never done something like this before, you need to phone a friend. There is also no explanation how to get the batteries into the units. If you've done this before, you can figure it out without too much trouble. If you haven't, and/or your eyes aren't that good, you will have problems."
4,Good for price,"Easy to assemble, easy to use, cheap, functions. Not convinced that it is bright enough or big enough to really keep me safe, but it definitely keeps me legal."
4,Great for the price,"Our of exasperation, I've bought these sets for friends who don't realize the importance of running bike lights.They're quite bright, easy to install. If the difference is between a set of these or no lights at all, just get them.The downside: they're very quick to steal, and they take large watch batteries which are more expensive and less common than AA or AAA."
4,"Good product, reasonable price","This is a good value light set, fairly easy to install. These lights are for cars and other people to see you... Not bright enough or with enough focus to light the path in front of you. Well worth the money and time for added safety."
5,Very cool for kids,"Just got these in the mail, so can't speak for battery life, but these are really neat for kids bikes. I have a 5 and 8 year old, and they love these little lights. They are about the size of a small egg... not very big at all, but they really are very bright. The headlight bulb fit perfect on the bike and has 3 modes. Push the button once and it flashes (fast like a strobe light), push the button again and the light stays on, push again and turns off. The head light can also be adjusted up or down. Very easy to install and use. The red light does the same except does not adjust once on the bike. My kids were riding in the garage in the dark today having a blast with these lights! I'd even get one for my own bike, if I rode at night. Very fast shipping also."
4,Pretty Good,"These LEDs are pretty good, they are extremely small, and can attach to your seat bag. However, these aren't very good for night riding, since the front light is not very bright. Use them only in emergencies, sundown or if you feel that drivers cant see you"
4,good deal!,"these lights are good for the price! They are a little small (but concerning the price that doesn't matter), but VERY bright!If you want bigger ones, buy more expensive ones, but this is a good deal!"
2,battery wore out after 1.5 wks,The battery wore out and to my recollection they are dim. Too small. I upgraded to the 3-Led light of the same brand and really like it.
4,Blinky lights accomplish purpose,I purchased 2 sets of Bike Blinky Safety lights for my teen sons. My goal was to have them be seen by drivers while riding in the dark. I think the lights were easy to mount and are accomplishing their purpose. I'd buy more for other bikes if I needed to.
5,Great!,"Really bright lights, these lights really make me feel safe riding at night. Works just as advertised, couldn't be happier."
5,Great deal,"Good product for a good price..exactly what I neededWas shipped quickly, arrived in great conditionEasy to use and to removeRecommend it"
2,No wonder it's cheap.,"When we first opened the box, there were no instructions on it and the lights are much smaller (about 1.5 inches!) then the picture suggests. It came with batteries, which was a nice, but they will probably last you 10 hours. After finally figuring out how to pop out the case to put the batteries in, one of the lights did not work. The other one worked fine, but this worked occasionally. We figured the button was defective. It gives you a vague idea of how how to install it on your bike. I would not recommend anyone buying this. You get what you pay for."
5,Good function and a small form factor,"This is what I wanted. Front and back, minimal, able to just leave on the bike. Flashing mode or solid mode."
2,Tiny white light.,"It can be used to signal yourself to oncoming traffic, but can not really be used to light the path. It is really a pair of tail lights, one red and one white."
5,Excellent product,The lights work very efficiently and they are nice and compact. Assembly was easy and they are pleasant to look at also.
1,Wrong Picture!!,"The item here has the wrong picture, which is a bit confusing, to say the least. What is named and described is a pair of 1-LED flashers, a red rear one and a white front one. This item is not the single rear flasher that is pictured. You can see what you're ordering on the Blinky website. I've added a pic of what you actually get."
3,doesn't fit!,"the product description says they'll ""clip to just about anything"" but doesn't say the maximum circumfrance, though it's right about them being cute. there's no place on my bike for the red light to go so that people will see me from behind."
3,simple and good,it's very tiny but the light is good. you can turn on and off easily. the battery is round one. I think the price is very reasonable
5,awesome,super bright and sturdy for there size. very sturdy mounts and great detachable design for security and allowing you to use the lights in other applications(ie running at night)
4,Be safe blinky LED lights,I love the smallness of the lights and the intensity of the light. Both are great combinations and I feel much safer on the rode driving my bike.
5,Plantet Bike Blinkey lights - Planet Brilliant!,"this things are fantastic for the money. I feel really safe finishing my late summer/early fall rides with them on. Super easy to use, nice switch feel, good mounting brackets. And ya, these suckers are bright. I like too that Planet Bike donates some of their profits. Cheers."
4,Cheap and Effective,"The build quality is not great on these, but for what they are I have no complaints. They were most certainly worth every penny. They mount firmly and haven't run out of batteries after months of daily use. I intend to use these for a long time!"
4,good,"These lights work fine and have seemed to hold up during light rain... ?? I try not to leave the lights on the bike when it's raining because of previous experience with other lights. Directions to put in the battery are on the side of the box. If you are looking for a super bright light so you can see the path in front of you, these don't do a fantastic job. They help a little, but you definitely can't see more than 10 feet in front of you. These are more for visibility so people see you at night."
5,blinky indeed,"This small addition to your bike will make a big impact. I now feel safe riding at night, and I can tell other cars see me from a distance. They easily install / adjust, and don't add weight like other bulky lights."
5,Bicycle light set,"They're really nice, and I think every bike should have them. powerful and install really easy, I just wish they made them to install on different size. right now they would install on the handle bar or the seat. My kid seat is all the way down. So all I did is glowed a Velcro strap to it and now I can Velcro the light any where I want, including the back of her helmet... Also, I found this way to be better so it's easy to move it from bike to another, while the other bikes are not in use. (u never can be toooooo much safe)"
2,Not as advertised,"The product received was not as advertised online. The online ad stated the bike Blinky light had 7 LED lights. When clicking the button to check out, it stated Planet Bike Blinky Safety 1-Led Bicycle Set. I was not sure which one was accurate, so decided to go with the advertised description. I was wrong. I installed the lights on my bicycles anyway and they work well enough. I just don not like being duped. I would like to think that it was a careless mistake."
2,"Obscure batteries suck! Should be AA, or AAA only!","I bought these as flashing lights to protect me from cars - not to illuminate my path (I've got a pair of Cateyes for that). These are cheap (that's why they're cheap). While they do flash nicely, the batteries cost about the same as the stupid lights I suspect, I haven't bought new ones because I haven't seen them anywhere I've glanced at. They're obscure watch battery like things, not the AAA's I was hoping for."
2,Not what I expected based on the description.,The lights are much small than I thought they would be and not bright enough to do much good. I was disappointed.
3,"Works fine, but easily stolen","The lights are bright enough if you want to be seen by traffic on the streets; however, the lights are easily stolen from their brackets."
3,"All things considered, they pass","These were affordable bike lights and they are about what you would expect.The Good:Affordable, small, easy to operate, easy to attach.The Bad:Cheaply made, not very bright."
4,Sweet,It spills a little sugar if not careful but the purpose of buying it was to keep people from double dipping wet spoons into sugar bowl. No more nasty sugar lumps and not near as messy as sugarbowl. Also great for little children.dlg
4,It's ok,"It works as it should, but it really does not hold alot and has to be refilled often if you use sugar as much as I do. I tried it with Splenda also and it did not work too good. Splenda is to lite and airy. If you like alot of sugar it gets alittle old pushing the button so many times."
1,Non Functional,"I bought this, hoping to find a more efficient way to put sugar in our company in the morning...I was very disappointed. the steam from the coffee rendered this dispenser useless. The sugar clogged up, and despite our best efforts in pushing the dispenser button, no sugar would come out. I would not recommend this; I would just say stick with the old fashioned sugar bowl..."
2,Not Ideal for Hot Beverages,This dispenser is not ideal for hot beverages. The steam from hot coffee causes the sugar to constantly clog the dispenser.
2,Not easy to control output,"Looks nice, but it lacks pour control. Its either full on or off unless you have a super good touch!"
5,Great Sugar Dispenser,The sugar dispenser is a great way to keep sugar dry and free from clumps. It looks good and I just keep it near the coffee pot. Doesn's take up a lot of space and the sugar doesn't leak out because of a cap that you keep on before and after use. Great product. Going to buy one for coffee creamer.
3,Great idea but could be better,"I think what bothered the folks that used this at my house was that they like full teaspoons of sugar and this dispenses in halves. They felt like they were pressing the button over and over to get the sugar. I personally think that's a little silly and that it's still a novel idea. BUT, that being said, it doesn't hold much sugar so you are refilling it much more often than you'd like. It's all there but a little tweaking would make it all there and then some."
3,ok but messy and a little rigid,"doesn't completely disperse sugar with one push. after you do, it still makes a little bit of a mess. Pressing the button is a little tough"
2,Great till it broke....,I've owned this dispenser for a few months and really liked it for dispensing setiva instead of having to open little packets. Worked pretty well until it tipped over and the clear plastic part seperated from the bottom. It's useless now. Diappointed it is so flimsy - it was a gentle fall.
2,misdirected,"when this product was introduced to me by a search, i was searching for a Powdered Sugar Dispenser and up pops this gadget. i thought it looked nice and easy to use but when i got it - i realized it wasn't a Powdered Sugar Dispenser - it was for regular sugar - - the Powdered Sugar was too thick to be dispensed but i imagine that regular sugar would work just fine. just dont get confused and make sure you know what you are buying when their search engine returns items that have nothing to do with your original search."
5,Braun shaver - great!,"This is my first ""micro screen"" shaver, and I could kick myself for waiting so long to try one. This is the closest shave I have ever had, and no skin irritation. I love this shaver."
3,Nice Watch,Have had the watch for some months now and had to take to the jeweler because it stopped and I thought maybe it might need a new battery. That was not the case. The jeweler said to keep an eye on it and bring back should it continue to do this. Only stopped working one time so far.
1,Who wants soggy waffles?,If you want soggy waffles this is the waffle iron for you. I was extremely disappointed in the waffles produced using this waffle iron. They were hard to get out and then they were very soggy. What a let down. We were all ready for a yummy waffle breakfast and that certainly isn't what we got! Definitely try another brand. Mine is going back for sure!
5,Makes excellent waffles,"This waffle maker is so simple to use and it makes excellent Belgian waffles. I'd recommend you go to the store and buy a special waffle mix, they are not expensive. This is also an excellent product for those trying to eat healthy. The price of this wafflemaker is also very good. Great for families too, because it makes a lot of waffles in one batch."
2,Less Than Happy!,"I find the inconsistency of the cooked waffles very frustrating. The preheat light seems to be of little value. I frequently have to use a fork to pry the waffles from the griddle. This is true even when using Pam to lightly ""grease"" the griddle. More often than not the waffles are overcooked and pull apart when I lift the lid. I plan to purchase a different waffle iron. Good luck!"
3,"undercooked edges, technical details misleading","Only the inner corners of the waffles are good: the corner parts are soft and soggy, not crispy, and that's after you've cooked them 10 minutes-- not 90 seconds as the technical specs claim! The 1200 watts power output sounded good compared to other cheap waffle-makers, but the maker is actually not very effective (I guess since it's covering a larger area than most.)If this is your price range and you're making waffles for two people, better to use a smaller machine and split each waffle in half to share, than to make 4 waffles at once where only part of each waffle is edible. I'm returning mine."
4,"Great Waffles, but keep an eye on storage.","The deep indentations held just the right amount of topping, and the griddle size is great. But after repeated use, we found that the waffles started became more and more undercooked. We think there is an electrical problem that prevents even heating, and seems to be triggered by changing our storage of it from flat to upright. Maybe this damages the cord? Otherwise, a great product."
1,Just doesn't pop!,This product was such a disappointment. It didn't have enought power to blow a feather out of the machine. Most to all of the kernals burned and the popcorn that did pop tasted terrible. I would not reccomend this product to anyone!
2,Not the Vintage Model 6201,"This is not the vintage model 6201, Toastmaster Automatic Popcorn Popper with glass top. Wonder why they are repeating model numbers?"
2,GOOD TEXAS ROOTS MUSIC....,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD BASED ON WORD OF MOUTH. I THINK THIS BAND HAS ALOT OF POTENTIAL BUT IF YOU WANT A BAND THAT IS SIMILAR BUT, IN MY OPINION, A MUCH MORE TALENTED GROUP, CHECK OUT CROSS CANADIAN RAGWEED'S SOUL GRAVY CD THAT HAS A DVD CONCERT WITH IT. YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN......"
2,Many problems with this lamp,"I bought one of these lamps and unfortunatley it's been nothing but problems. The first one I had took longer and longer for the light to come on when you turned on the switch until it eventually took like 10-15 minutes before it would light up.GE was very good about replacing the lamp. However, the same thing happened to the second lamp . . . and then the third. I have had three new lamps in the last year. I just received the fourth today from GE. It seems like there's some kind of design/engineering problem with the lamp. It's not that the bulbs are burning out, it seems to have more to do with the floruescent balast, but I'm no engineer, so I don't really know.What I can say is that the lamp is bright, the color of the light is very white (not yellow like some flourescent bulbs) and it's very energy efficient (55w for 300w of light).I can only hope that this one does last a little longer than the first three I've had!"
1,The majority I bought work poorly,"I bought seven of these lamps 2 to 3 years ago at Home Depot. They throw a lot of light, use little electricity, and the bulbs last a long time. After a few years, 4 of them started to have the same problem as the other reviewers. That is, they take minutes to start !! New bulbs didn't help. GE says they do not make them anymore (hmm...I wonder why). Since I don't have receipts anymore, they say I will get coupons for other GE products if I mail back the lamps at my expense. Not gonna happen....buyer beware..... !!!"
4,I'm the only one that LOVED this lamp.,"It lasted 6 years and 2 months. I loved it.Longest lasting torchiere lamp that I owned!Now, finding a suitable replacement will be a problem."
3,"not bad, given what they had to work with","You've got to feel for the publishers of this novelization. They released it in 1999 in order to coincide with the theatrical release of a movie that never got released in theatres, and is finally coming out in 2000 under a different title (HEAVY METAL 2000), so they've had their potential audience undercut.However, Eastman and Timmons do the best they can with a virtually nonexistent plot, and it's a very diverting read. However, one has to wonder why the average consumer would bother with a prose version of a HEAVY METAL story (a franchise known for visuals) that uses Julie Strain (a woman best appreciated visually) as a model for its protagonist. Okay, there's a nice photo insert, but still...."
5,Another creative release from Big and Rich,"A year ago I purchased Big and Rich's debut album ""Horse of a differant color"" and I fell in love instantly with its jumpy heartfelt tunes. It was a creative but also young and naive album, so I was a little scared that they had given all they had on their first album... I was wrong. With ""Coming to your city"" Big and Rich makes another tremendous bang with rocking guitar riffs along with everything else that country lovers liked about the album. Is this a more matured Big and Rich? Not at all, but isnt that what we all loved about them in the first place? For anyone who loved their first album this is highly reccomended."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"The only passably decent song on the whole CD is 8th of November, and even that gets old after awhile."
3,too spangled,Reasonably good till the unnecessary Kris Kristofferson dialogue - that's what liner notes are for. Then the so called bonus track -what crap- but it seems Big & Rich have problems ending otherwise really good albums.
1,"Oh, the humanity...","In case there was any doubt that Big & Rich could sink any lower than their abysmal debut, they shatter all such thoughts with the excruciating ""Comin' to Your City."" That B&R; are a blight on Country Music is understood; it's actually an understatement.They are to art what leprosy is to flesh.From the stomach purging opener throughout the rest of the vile proceedings, things just go from worse to worst. The one exception (just as there was one exception on their debut) is the surprisingly moving ""8th of November"" with Kris Kristofferson.Should our military ever need to torment another third-world dictator hiding out in some palace (aka Panamanian strongman Noriega), I recommend repeated playings of this CD. Although, I am sure the UN would protest our cruel actions."
1,a bad joke,Big&Rich are like Brooks&Dunn Meets Cleadus T.Judd or something. alot of there material comes across highly gimmicky&I don't get half the hype.they are like the Spinal Tap Of country&I gotta believe that all the Forefathers of country Music are Cringing at this act.
2,"Not ""Horse of a Different Color"", but...","I am, still reviewing this album. I must admit, it's going to take listening to it over and over again to really know if I like it or not, but upon first listening to all the songs at least once, I am very dissapointed with it.BnR's first album had so much more soul, meaning, and fun in all of the songs. Every song on ""Horse..."" was mind blowingly fantastic (to my pleasant surprise as I only bought their first album for their hit ""Save a Horse...""). Their new album just seems ""thrown"" together.However, as I said, I am still listening to it in hopes it will sink in. Some how, I think it's just going to sink, for me anyway."
5,GREAT SECOND ALBUM FROM THE BOYS!,"I loved Horse of a different color and never stopped playing it when it first came out and was wondering how John Rich could possibly write an equally great album -but he has... I have just received it in England so have played it a few times but the songs are very good and my children love it too.. Big Kenny has a very distinctive voice that is haunting. John Rich writes a great melody with meaningful words. I would tell folk to BUY IT,the album gets better with each play. My favourite track is Leap of Faith,Very haunting. My kids love Blow my mind (for the catchy chorus), You havent disappointed this fan,John and Kenny! One question now-When is the next album going to be released!!!?"
4,Sophomore Jinx? Not Really,"This CD is not as good as their debut but hey, that's a tough act to follow. I give them a solid review for this effort and maybe it will grow on me more over time. Tracks like ""Soul Shaker"" and ""Blow My Mind"" actually sound better live than they do in their studio versions on this CD. ""Caught up in the Moment"" and ""Jalapeno"" were a nice surprise. Big & Rich are very unique. That being said, I'd like to see them continue to push the envelope and change the scope of their ""genre"", whatever it is. If you really liked Horse of a Different Color, this is a more or the same (but not as clever). If you were thinking they couldn't surpass the success of their first CD, you are right. It is still worth a listen and it will have a few radio/bar favorites to sing along to."
3,Lacks the balance and substance of the first album.,"I have been a big fan of big and rich since I heard wild west show. It was fresh and just a all around great song as were most of the tracks on ""Horse of a different color"". I like this CD, but there is to much of the ""save a horse ride a cowboy"" style music and songwriting going on here. I like that style and I know it's a big part of these guy's sound but I would have loved more songs like, W.W.S., Six foot town, Holy Water, Deadwood mountain, and live this life. These songs brought a fantastic balance and a sense of substance to there first that just isn't on ""City"". It's good and it does have its moving moments but I would have loved to have heard more songs about things other than drinking, women, and sex. Overall though, it is still a good CD just not a great CD."
1,Release a better first single,"The song Comin to your city is one of the worst country songs in the past year. Alot of crappy songs have been released, but Musik Mafia seems to be taking all the credit. I love every genre of music, and like the idea they have. Replace Big and Rich ,and I might give it a listen. Also, they like to exploit midgets. I saw them on Imus in the morning on tv this morning. I was horrified seeing a midget standing on crutchs in front of the drum kit, dancing like he was in pain. Scared Marilyn Manson? HA!!! scared him because he cant belive you guys get millions for putting out crap like this. Musik Mafia hopefully will be gone by 2007"
1,Big & Rich Screwed Up Big Time!,I want to start by saying that I loved their debut album but this new album is full of filler songs.They apparently didn't put the effort in this album like their first one.They will be lucky if their career in music last long enough for them to release another album.This is all a big screw up and it is not worth your money.
3,Could have been a little better but it was okay.,"It was the first book I read from the author and I thought it was alright. The only problem I had was keeping up with the different locations. Other than that, it was fine. I thought the opening scene was a little cheesy but it was good cheesy."
2,not what's pictured,"the stand received is shorter than the one pictured. i decided to keep it to avoid return. it seems ok, but would have preferred a taller stand as the one appears in the picture. will probably buy another, taller stand this summer, but not here."
1,Not recommended,"This item is of poor quality. The + (positive) contact at the bottom did not have a spring and therefore, did not make contact with the battery (AA type). I used a spring from an old ball point pen and cut the spring in half and wound it around the + contact wire. This allowed the + contact to make a connection with the battery. Having done that, the tool does not work very good. The alligator clip is weak and of poor quality. the test light is partially obscured by the spring contact for the - (negative) contact of the battery. Even with a direct connection (test point connect to the alligator clip) the light glowed with varying brightness with each test.I cannot recommend this product to anyone."
1,Disappointed - They Didn't Last Long,"The cheap bulbs that came with our Hunter fan went out in about a week.These GE bulbs only lasted a few weeks in the ceiling fan. Not a good buy.I am now using CFR ""twirly"" bulbs and they seem to be longer lasting. You get what you pay for."
3,Works well,These lights work well but they are too expensive. If you can get out to the store you will save money.
4,"A great album, but....","Overall, the band is fantastic & the recording is top-notch. My only quibble is with the vocals that are often not recorded with the best quality & are mixed way too low. In fact, if you listen while you drive, you may barely hear them. If you're listening in a quiet room with the volume cranked to ""11"", then no problem at all. That being said, Live Dates II is admittedly a very enjoyable album."
1,Bad,"While a good dvd by itself, its intentions are very bad. Most of the footage was stolen from several people who were planning to release it on a different dvd."
2,Another Pac DVD?,"Another in the endless list of DVD documentaries chronicling the life of late rapper Tupac Shakur. Running at about an hour and featuring interviews with KRS One, Mike Tyson, Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopez, and Pac's group, The Outlawz, ""4-Ever"" really doesn't go anywhere that previous ""Pac-umentaries"" haven't been. A lot of the Pac footage has been included in other releases and the interviews aside from some interesting stories from Tyson really doesn't bring anything new and insightful. For die-hard Tupac fans only."
4,Performs as expected,Installed this on an older motor that didn't have a safety kill switch.Pros: Seems to be of good quality. Works well after being installed.Cons: Requires experienced/professional installation. No basic/typical wiring diagram in package
1,Oversized Universal Remote Control,"THE ITEM IS FINE.....THE DELIVERY STINKS !!! ITEM WAS PROMISED TO BE DELIVERED BETWEEN 12/17/06 - 12/22/06. THIS WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY DISABLED BROTHER. THE CONTROL DID NOT ARRIVE UNTIL 12/26/06. A BIT LATE FOR CHRISTMAS. IN REVIEW OF THE ORDER, I PLACED IT ON 12/13/06 AND IT WAS NOT PROCESSED UNTIL, 12/22/06. THIS IS POOR SERVICE. THIS WAS MY 1ST AMAZON PURCHASE AND MY LAST."
4,How to build a hotrod model A,This is a good book to help with the basics of setting up your chassis and body as well as touching on all the other aspects involved. It helps to have lots of pictures and notes during the build because things are always changing. I take many photos while at swap meets of old bodies and many measurements too.
2,"Basic, Street Rod Opinion","This book gives a very basic overview of the construction of a Model A street rod. There is a big difference between a street rod and a hot rod. This book covers the build up of a street rod, the author extols the virtues of the small block Chevy, run flat tires(?!), and billet wheels. There is very little actual how-to in this book, it consists mostly of opinion, and questionable opinion at that.If you want to build a real hot rod and spend significantly less check out ""How to Build a Traditional Ford Hot Rod"" by Vern Tardel and Mike Bishop."
2,How to or Editorial?,"This is a nicely put together book but it is filled with much more opinion than how to articles with one paragraph explinations of such items as rear ends. I didnt say the opinions are bad its just that this book should not have ""How to"" in the title. I was disappointed."
3,Pretty Good,"I guess I was expecting all Veggie action....What we got was a combination of other stuff.(Maybe that's what the ""and more"" means on the title. Overall it was good though. The Veggie portion was great as always. The comedy between Bob and Larry is the funniest. I must admit though, I never heard of Twippo until I watched the video. My 3 yr old loved it! She is now saying,""Mommy, I want to watch my new Veggie."" We cannot wait until we get to see the movie."
3,Great if You Lack the Original Material,"Great stuff if you are not already entrenched in the Elvis catalog. If you are a fan, there is not too much new stuff to justify purchase."
1,Horrible,"This game looks like something for the atari 2600, terrible graphics and gameplay. The game does,nt load correctly to begin with, i contacted strategy First support, of course it was my system(s) thats at fault, thats a 1.9 gig system and a 2.7 gig system, yet, both my machines are to blame, amazing.Anyway, i returned the game, got another one, same problem! Junk. You get a cd key, which you won,t need, by the way, it does,nt ask for it. To cut a long story short, avoid this garbabe.Unless you have $40 to waste. Oh wait till you load the second cd that comes with it, theres a surprise all by itself."
1,Price is for One Bulb Only!,"I fell for the ""Pieces: 12"" line as well. Deceptive advertising, wish I could give it negative stars. You want this 12-pack : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T3TDO/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk"
2,lasted only5 months,"Bought this in October of 2011, here it is, March 4th 2012 and it has burned out. For the price, it is not worth it. Just glad i didn't order the big pack."
5,Solid lighting,"My brother used these bulbs in his science project and blew everybody away with how bright they were. His project definitely stood out in a crowded room, and gathered a crowd as people hovered around the bright glow. It was definitely too bright to look at naked and would need a lamp with a shade if used around the house."
1,One bulb for $6 - not a pack of 12,"If it were a pack of 12, this product would get 5 stars. The bulb itself is excellent quality and very very bright.Minus 2 stars for being a single bulb at over $6.Minus 2 stars for false advertising.As another reviewer stated, the description is outright false. The table states that this is 1 pack, but also says ""Pieces: 12"" - that's 12 bulbs, right? Wrong!In what world are there 12 pieces to this item? You get a single bulb (that's 1), standard soft cardboard bulb case (2), bubble wrap (3), Amazon invoice (4), box (5), shipping label (6), barcode sticker (7). So I guess in a universe where 7 = 12, this is a 12-piece item.Now they've added a description below the table, and at the end of it is a nice little cover-your-ass statement: ""Price is for one bulb.""If you're looking for a 12-pack of these bulbs, you want this:GE 10429-12 A21 Incandescent Soft White Light Bulb, 150-Watt, 12-Pack"
1,deceptive advertizing,"The BIC Supply states on the Amazon website that the product is a pack of twelve for the quoted price. It's not. I was shipped 3 bulbs, not three dozen. This is totally deceptive."
5,Best information about heaven I have found,"Matthew's first-hand account of what happens when we die, dictated to his Mother from the other side, is by far the most intelligent and helpful information on this topic I have found. This book sets the standard by which I assess other books on the topic. I recommend it to anyone who wants to set their mind at rest about this topic, especially if you have been taught to fear God or ""judgment.""We ""judge"" ourselves! We reunite with our other selves from other lifetimes. We plan our next incarnation with our chosen group of souls, and sign contracts with them. These processes are explained in detail, with clarity and compassion. Once we are settled in, we, as souls, proceed to learn and grow, create and share our gifts in a truly heavenly environment. Fear of death was erased from my mind. I read this book 4 times, and recommend it to my friends and clients."
5,Finally.,Answers. Finally! I think it was meant to be that I found this book. My husband who was only 28 was killed by a drunk driver 13 years ago. Not a day goes by that I don't miss him and feel the devastation of the loss. This book answered so many questions and confirmed so many ideas for me. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU !!!
5,Love this tool!,"I'm not big into gardening and working outside on the lawn......especially getting rid of weeds, but this tool makes the job easy, and almost fun. It's simple and very easy to use. I like it because you don't have to bend over to pull out the weeds. It works especially well on weeds that have large or long roots. Those are among the most difficult to pull out by hand, but they come right up, using this tool!"
1,Grampa's weeder,"This product may be good for small, shallow-rooted weeds such as dandelions, but I live in Florida where the weeds grow big and deep. The product was just about useless for my application."
1,Doesn' work,"Got this to help me wrestle the roots of vines. Tried and tried but can't get this thing to work. There is not enough leverage to actually pull anything out of the ground, even the dandolions won the battle. I did better using my hands and my little hand shovel. Had high hopes. A complete disappointment."
5,The BEST weeder around,"Ordered this because I have knee trouble - was skeptical at first, but quickly became a convert; really does the job as it claims. Only possible drawback is it's not effective on grasses or very small weeds with little roots, the bigger the weed the easier. Bought one for my 66-year-old sister and my 86-year-old mother also (I'm 57). Recommend heartily."
4,Works Great,"I purchased this when we first bought our house and needed to weed. It came very fast and it was very, very easy to use. I love it because I don't have to get on my hand and knees to weed. I would recommend this to the avid gardner."
1,Never got it!,"Although codymercantile's description did not exclude my area from shipping, I received an email cancellation several days after placing the order. ""Sorry but, we do not ship this item to Hawaii."" They claim a refund was issued but I have not yet verified it.I hope codymercantile makes the correction to their description so they don't continue to waste people's time.As far as the product... never got it, never tried it."
4,Gentle understanding,"This kind and compassionate book about dealing with the death of a loved one is intended for small children but I wouldn't hesitate to offer it to young people up to the age of twelve or so. Ideally a parent or other counselor would go through it along with a small child. The words are simple and clear and the illustrations are really great. The activities lead the individual from his or her feelings of loss to a place where they may be able to let go. Actually, the recommended activities would [and have, I think, at least in our library]helped adults as well as kids."
1,"Lock and latch did,nt last",I bought this cash box to use at our garage sale. The latch broke off during the first day with regular use.
1,Great Slide Show,This entire DVD is just a slide show presentation of Masonic images. There is no commentary and little of no educational value. 357
2,craig karaoke,"Its fun. My kid enjoys it but there are obviously some kinks either in the system or in my individual machine. My daughter hit a couple of buttons out of sequence and somehow the whole thing was put on a mute and we couldnt get any sound. I went to the troubleshooting section of the manual and one of the suggestions was to make sure the machine was not on MUTE However, there was no mute button, no reference to the mute function anywhere in the manual.I shut it off for about ten minutes, still not working.After it was off all night, it worked again. However then I hit a wrong button and the whole thing happened all over again.Its hard to tell a 7 year old after she has brought all her friends over tha there something wrong yet again with the machine"
1,Kareoke Nightmare,"Hi! I Bought this Kareoke for X-mas with my 11 year old sister in mind. Thank God I decided to play with it before I gave it to her for Christmas. I was very Dissapointed because the sound quality is horrible. The volume is very low and you can barely here yourself through the microphone. The Monitor is even worst,You can barely see the lyrics. To make matters worst for me the monitor did'nt show any lyrics at all so I had to return it to the store. I rebought it thinking it had just been defected but NOpe! it's just no good. Well if you are interested in a CD player then maybe you can use it for that however you can find yourself a wayyyyyy better Cd player for a lot less money!!!!"
5,My children love this!,"After reading the mixed reviews, I bought it anyway, and I am so glad I did! My 8 yr.-old daughter just loves it and she and my 5 yr.-old son play it for hours on end! The graphics are easily readable and I can't complain about anything the machine does. I just wish there were more cd+g cds out there for kids."
5,Lot's of Fun!,This is a great gift for the kids or the family! Lot's of singing will be in your home if you get one!
4,You've got it Rita !,"Missed Rita's live performance in Vegas, so glad to have the opportunity to get this CD."
5,Great fun!,We stumbled onto this little gem at the library.. I enjoyed it so much I ended up getting copies for all my favorite lady friends!Rita Rudner has a playful quality that comes with some of the funniest material around.I also appreciate that she doesn't use any foulmouth language.ENJOY!
5,Rita Rudner at her best,"Rita Rudner is just simply great, fantastic, amazingly entertaining. How she observes men and women so precisely and makes the best jokes about their differences is something I cannot comprehend.I totally recommend this DVD. Her jokes come one after another with no particular effort. She just talks and talks non-stop but you'll be on the floor laughing out loud until your stomach hurts real bad."
4,A little shorter it would be a 5,This book was good and Rickman had a lot of issues to tie together he did it very well. The story twisted and unfolded well but if it was 2/3's the length it would have been 5 stars
2,forgetable,"I had a lot of high expectations before reading this book. I had hoped it would be the next book to keep me from sleeping. Although it seemed to flow well, for the most part it was quite forgetable. I thought the author could have slowed down on some of the action to build suspense. This book was touted by some to scare the pants off you. Not true in my case. Plot seemed a little convoluted and hard to follow. Really a disappointment."
2,A Novella extended to 700 pages,"I really wanted to like this book. I really did. The story is unique and fascinating, the portrayal of the town is detailed and intriguing, there is a broad cast of characters each bringing something different. But it just...goes...on...and...on....ad...nauseam. Not nearly enough happens to warrant the book extending to the length of 700 pages. And I'm no stranger to long books, I love digging in. But by the mid four hundreds of Curfew my brain was turning to mush. The scenes start to reek of repetition, the same characters doing essentially the same things for hundreds of pages on end. I'd love to read an abridged version of this, and I hate abridges versions. This is NOT a page turner, but a long hard slog. Like I said, a unique story, but man you're going to have to work for it."
4,Nothing groundbreaking but worth a look.,"This is a pretty well put together horror novel. It takes its time developing the plot and its characters, which many horror novels don't bother to do. The characters are quite well developed and the many seperate storylines weave together well. It paints a fascinating picture of the Welsh border and the New Age movement. And most importantly, it has some very creepy moments. All in all its a satisfying book. But its not anything new. It didn't leave me unsettled or thinking the way a great horror novel should and it has pretty much the same ending as every Dean Koontz book I've ever read. If you want to read a good standard horror novel check this one out, but if you want to read a great horror novel look for something like Stephen King's Low Men in Yellow Coats from Hearts in Atlantis."
2,Bleh,"I suppose you have to interested in such things to find this book interesting. While the wording is nice and flows well, the plot and characters quickly become tangled and hard to keep seperate. I'm selling my copy, and already have a buyer! Hope she enjoys it far more than I did!"
2,huh?,"I hate to be the dissenter here, but I didn't enjoy the book much. Actually, I didn't even finish it. After 50 pages I just gave up. I was getting confused as to who does what. He'll have several paragraphs of general verse, then one paragraph will have on sentence of critical plot information, but I always missed it because it was surrounded by general stuff (general stuff - like describing someone's day or the minutae a character is doing at a given moment). Sever times I had to go back a page or two because I was just lost.Maybe it's because this was my 'subway' book, which wouldn't lend itself to complex reading. but after my 50 pages there wasn't much story yet, I couldn't tell what character was doing what, and generally didn't feel I was in the story and didn't care what was going to happen. There ae too many other books that can such you in from page one - and after 50 pages this wasn't one of them, so I'm moving on."
5,"Wow, REALLY, wow","its much more than a picnic basket... I use it to keep my dirty laundry in, and a second to hold my dry goods. The thing folds down flat when empty, and when you need it you simply pull it up and the sides hold the unit up on its own. It's very innovative, and I can't believe it works.I just this minute bought another one."
4,wrestling movie,"I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 because of the love story within it, but it does help sell it if your watching it with the old lady. As far as I know it is the only real good mainstream wrestling movie I've ever seen and the story line is good. It shows the hard work and deication it takes to hit the mat and shows a small portion of life inside the wrestling room. Enjoy"
2,Referred movie...,"This may have been epic when it came out, it's just old and needs to be remade. Story is well suited for a love story. The intensity of the sport is A class. As always I am a big fan of school wrestling. But most likely would not recommend to purchase."
2,The movie was sort of ok but awfully hokey,"The wrestling part was decent but the rest seemed rather forced, as tho its only purpose was to give it a veneer of what's socially accepted. Which ended up hamstringing the movie. And Louden's buddy...gimme a break! The book was far better. The screenwriters veered to much away from the book and made the non-wrestling part dumb and boring. ""Hi! I'm Louden Swain and i'm just another airhead who licks up the spit of the status quo just like everyone else...So what i kicked Chute's butt..that was just to cover up how lame i am..."" You're better off reading the book. At least it had some degree of reality to it."
1,vision quest dvd,This was a very poor quality reproduction of the original video. it looked like and old tv rerun.
1,Bad Quality,"I ordered this for my husband and recieved a DVD that is far to scratched to even play in a player. Unfortunatly my husband never told me how bad it was so I didn't think I could returned it after so long. Basically he never even had a chance to watch it. comes in cheap cardboard box case, no wonder its in bad shape."
2,Plot Quest,"I had never even heard of the novel ""Vision Quest,"" much less read it. And since I just saw the film, that fate has been forever sealed. Sweet but simple Louden Swain is a wrestler on the local high school team. His goal in life is to beat the rival school's top member. Then a beautiful, older, realistic young woman named Carla boards in his house and the young infatuated Louden finds himself having deeper thoughts and aspirations -- like being a gynecologist in outer space! The film just goes through the motions in typical eighties fashion, especially with the laughably predictable ending. Luckily, both stars would go on to do better things."
2,Vision Quest,I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THE SELLER DESCRIBED IT AS BEING IN VERY GOOD CONDITION. WHEN TRYING TO WATCH IT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE DISC SKIPS STARTING AT JUST OVER HALF WAY THROUGH. I'VE SEEN THE MOVIE BEFORE SO I KNEW WHAT THE OUTCOME IS. TO SUM IT UP I'M NOT REAL HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.
4,Wrestling movie that pleases,"""Vision Quest"", from 1985, is a wrestling movie that grabs your attention and holds it. The film is well-cast and is headed up by a likeable young Matthew Modine. More than a little innocent, Modine's character, Louden Swain, is a terrific set-up to take on a favored champion opponent. Reminiscent of Robby Benson's ""One on One"" from a few years prior, ""Vision Quest"" moves ahead nicely toward a charged last few minutes....the best minutes of the film. The side romance is a bit of a distraction but it is fun to see a young Madonna perform ""Crazy For You"". This is an appealing film and highly recommendable."
4,Perfect Inspiration,"As a 3rd year high school wrestler, I can relate to the motives and intentions that are set by Louden. This movie has great wrestling scenes (a little over-doing it with the latteral drop / headlock) and serves as a great inspiration to get anyone off of their feet for the start of the season."
5,"Classic, a must-have!","This movie is a classic, one that must be viewed at least yearly come state tournament time. The soundtrack is perhaps the BEST movie soundtrack of the 80's! Interesting to note that all 3 lead actors/actresses later ""made it big""."
5,Vision Quest slams down the opposition,"This is an emotional movie about a boy destined to be a man. In this tearjerker, Matthew Modine turns in a wonderful performance, starring as Lodin Swaine, the high school wrestler struggling through the pressures of the wrestling life and also the perils of being a teenage boy. With a pending potential match against defending state champion, Shute. While cutting weight and training for the big match, Lodin meets an older girl named Carla, and falls in love. The movie ends with the climatic match...and you'll be surprised with the turnout.This movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster through the harsh life of a high school wrestler. Being one myself in the past, this movie touched a soft spot in my heart. This is a must see for wrestlers and anyone else who has struggled through a tough time in life."
5,Motivating,I've always enjoyed this heart warming and motivating movie. I like the bit of romance but most if all the motivating story line. It makes me want to go out and run a few miles and go to the gym.
2,Not a fan myself,"I bought this for my boyfriend who's a wrestler and he loved it but I was not thrilled with it, buying used made me nervous but it was almost brand new."
5,Exactly what the item description stated...,"Arrived very next business day, even though shipping info said it would take 2 business days. Item as described."
4,Corny old movie - but love it.,"Wresters don't get a lot of movies - especially high school wrestling. This one has some great moments, the romance is overdone - the story would have been great without it."
5,Love it!!!,Great resource for beginners! I use it in conjunction with the Rand McNally Beginner workbook. Highly recommended!!!
5,Another Great Words Their Way Book!,I own all the other Words Their Way books so why not this one? Most of the time I do not get spellers this sophisticated but some of my ESOL students this year are good spellers. I think these word sorts will help those students become even better spellers than they are and comprehend vocabulary more deeply.
4,Puccini's Greatest Hits,"This is a lovely recording. I have owned it for about ten years and it has stayed a favorite even after many, many repeat performances in my CD player. I would particularly recommend this for the person who is just beginning to explore the delights of opera. Monserrat Caballe makes two wonderful appearances where her beautiful pianissimo is used to great effect (an aria from ""Manon Lescaut"" and ""Vissi d'arte"" from ""Tosca""), and Placido Domingo's ""Tosca"" arias are simply gorgeous. The only disappointment for me is Ghena Dimitrova's slightly thin rendition of ""O mio babbino caro,"" which isn't nearly as lush and memorable as Kiri Te Kanawa's famous (infamous?) rendition from ""A Room With a View."" But who cares? You've got Franco Corelli's ""Nessun dorma"" to make it all better."
3,Good value mat,"Works out well for Yoga classes. Only complain is it is a bit slippery when my hands get sweaty. Wish it had a little better ""traction""."
3,"A little slow in the beginning, but definately picks up.","Sex,Money, Power and racism you get it all with this Patterson novel. He does a fairly decent job of developing his characters and everyone and I mean everyone is a suspect. He developes motives for some of the characters which are inconsistent with the real story. He attempts to get you involved with what it's like living in the south but does not do a very good job. His main character (who is a lawyer) is 10% lawyer and 90% cop who is definately out of his element. His ending is great as are most of his novels, however there are other Patterson novels I would suggest (Degree of Guilt, Silent Witness), however if you are a hard core Patterson fan (as I am) you'll enjoy classic Patterson In ""The Outside Man""."
2,"Slow, not his best",I like most of his other books I've read but this is slow and a bit obvious as it goes along. If your have never read Patterson start with another...
3,Ho-Hum,"Main character, Adam Shaw was only missing a cape as he took on everyone in his search for truth and justice. Yawwwn!"
3,Old mexican song,"I listened to the samples of your top 16 old mexican music but I'm looking for a song called ""Tres Flores"". Some of the lyrics say Me gusta cantale a viento (I like singing in the wind). Hopefully, you can locate for me. It was sung by my father many, many, many years ago. I have enjoyed listening to the samples very much even if they are a little muffled."
5,Refreshing devotional tool,"I received this book as a gift and am now giving it as a gift to others. I find the highly paraphrased translation refreshing for devotional purposes. I don't usually care for impressionist art, but I found the pieces in this book captivating. The artist's interpretations of the paintings are very helpful to a novice like myself."
1,Pure junk!,This has got to be one of the worst toasters. The bread jams or doesn't go down. I doesn't brown evenly. Only one side even works on mine. Skip it!
1,fire hazzard!,"You get what you pay for..... This toaster is a potential fire hazzard. If you toast bagles, as my family does often, then the bagles get stuck (which is really not that uncommon). What becomes a hazzard is that the toaster DOES NOT TURN OFF. The bagles gets stuck and the toaster keeps toasting. Very distrubing for our family, especially since my children often do their own toasting. I returned it."
1,Terrible,"What on earth were they thinking? This toaster is unable to handle pop-tarts. They slip through the crack and fall all the way to to bottom and sit there. When the toaster is done and ""pops"" up, the pop-tarts remain on the bottom of the toaster, or even worse get smashed by the popping action and crumble.To add insult to injury, the knobs for dark/light toasting level actually have a setting labeled ""pop-tart""."
2,Toastmaster toaster,The description for the toaster said it had deep slots for bread. I use a bread machine to make bread and wanted a toaster that would toast the entire piece of bread and not have to reverse the bread and start over again. The toaster works well with store bread but not with bread made in a bread machine. The delivery from any products ordered from Amazon have always arrived promptly and earlier than promised.
1,broken in 3 months,"Don't buy this one. I got it as a Christmas gift and within 2 months of mild use, one side broke - wouldn't keep toast down. A month later, the other side broke as well. Cheap product. I'm back to my 10-year old 2-slice toaster. Glad I kept that!"
2,book is complicated,"This book is complicated. Although the information/trivia on bats was good, we were hoping that this book would have easy instructions to make a bat house however the designs are difficult to follow. So we had to go out and buy another book with easy blueprint plans so we could make a bat house."
4,Bat House,Received this book just as discribed. Diagrams and information were complete but we didn't know that bats required so much as far as their habitat go. Felt it would probably not be a very good area in our part of the country to have a house.
5,A Classic from Wishbone Ash...,"This is a great cd full of interesting songs and as usual, brilliant guitarwork(Check out the title track)save for one sappy instrumental, this is a must-have if you are a fan. Get the BGO remastered version paired with 'New England', see my review on this 2 disc set."
3,"If your a Wishbone Ash fan, don't hesitate to get this album",Don't be afraid of the 'cheesy' cover. This album has some great tunes. It'l grow on you.
3,Good Read!,"If you liked the Hawk's Way series, you will like this story. The time traveling heroine, seeking revenge against the murdering bank robber, is shocked to find herself rescued into the future. You also get to meet Honey Farrell, the heroine of (Honet And The Hired Hand) and Adam Philips of The Rancher And The Runaway Bride. It is a re-releace, that starts the whole of the Hawks' Way series."
2,Remington Body Waves rollers,"I bought these rollers, my first hot rollers ever, hoping for good results, which I did not get. They took a long time to heat up, took forever to put in my hair, clips did not stay in, so my hair all fell out of the rollers. They took a long time to cool down. When I removed them, the curls were pretty, but only lasted for about 30 minutes."
5,Remington Body Waves Ionic Hair Setter,I have used this style of hotcurlers for over 35yrs & LOVE LOVE LOVE them! So accomadating & portable & easy to use & VERY cost effective!!! Please DONT stop making them!!!
2,Not the Model Number Advertised,The Electric Rollers that were advertised and that I purchaseed were Remington Body Waves - Model 1080i - The Model Number that was shipped was Model Number 1080n. Is this false advertisment? Really very disappointed. I ordered on line so that I would not have the hassle or waste the time of going to a retail establishment and making the purchase. I now have to figure out a way to repackage the merchandise and get it to the shipper!!!
1,Do not buy this!!,"I got this curler set, and I completely regret it! I used it once, and I wont touch it again! It left my hair frizzy, and there was a bump from where the clamps were. It took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down. I wouldn't even give it one star...take my advice- DO NOT buy this!!"
5,Hairsetters,"These rollers are great. Your curls stay intact and your curls are tight and have body. I like these way better than curlers with the felt. These are highly recommended! Plus, they last for years. This is my second set. I bought my first set 5 years ago, and I used them everyday."
3,hoodia tea,"Bija Hoodia Slimming Herbal Tea Blend,dietary supplment - has a nice, clear taste, uses one tea bag per cup of hot water. If it suppresses the appetite it is very subtle. What it definitely did was make me feel better - better frame of mind, more energy. I would buy it again. It is a tea made of green tea, magnolia bark, and hoodia herb."
3,Artsy Meets Creepy,"Incubus is a well done art film with a creepy edge. This is evident both on and off screen. The film is an interesting approach to good vs. evil, but with a scary representation of the occult. It is interesting to note that Ann Atmar and Milos Milos both committed suicide in after appearing in Incubus."
5,Remarkable,"I bought this film thinking ""William Shatner in the world's only movie filmed entirely in Esperanto. This HAS to be funny"". Instead what I got is one of THE best horror films I have seen since Jacques Tourneur's Curse of the Demon. This film is very beautiful and very creepy. And Shatner does not ham it up like he would later on in Star Trek."
4,Marvelously offbeat,"This unique and artsy supernatural horror film, with all dialogue in Esperanto (with English subtitles), was made by the same folks who produced TV's THE OUTER LIMITS (including Oscar-winning cinematographer Conrad Hall). Hall's photography, striking locations, an unusual, eerie plot and that great OUTER LIMITS music make it the proverbial ""must-see"" for horror fans."
5,Incubus,"I saw this by accident one night on the SciFi channel, and found it to be surprisingly good.. It certainly made me have more respect for William Shatner. He plays a wounded soldier coming home to live with his sister in their little cottage in the countryside. He catches the eye of a female demon, who schemes to win his soul as a gift for the devil. Her reasoning is that a pure and good soul is better than the corrupted and evil souls she collects everyday. But, the task is more than she bargains for when he falls in love with her. The ensuing events anger her demon comrades who summon up an incubus (played by Milos Milos) to wreak revenge. I won't ruin it anymore, but there is more to the story. A story of the fight between good and evil. The direction in terms of camera angles and cinematography is really beautiful. Shot in Esperanto!"
3,Worth a look,"This lost 1965 cult classic features a pre-Star Trek William Shatner as a morally righteous man who becomes the target of a beautiful succubus whom has grown weary of seducing tainted men. Mistaken largely for a foreign film because the dialogue is in Esperanto (Incubus was filmed in California), the film manages to use it's low budget to it's advantage and is heavy in gloomy atmosphere and mood setting music. The acting isn't too bad, although many of the actor's pronounciation of the language isn't anything to write home about. All in all, Incubus is worth a look for older horror fans who remember the days when it didn't take loads of blood and gore to scare an audience."
3,"FOR ""B"" FREAKS ONLY","Do you like ""B"" moives???? Here's one for ya! Better than Plan 9 From Outerspace but not as good as Forbidden Planet. For those who truly love the camp, the bad acting, the bad scripts...this is the movie for you. Done in Esperanto so it would show better at film festivals, INCUBUS is pure ""B"". What makes it so appealing is that William Shatner stars in it. No ""B"" fan has greater love than to see a well known and respected actor appear in a ""B"" movie...back in their youth...back when they had hair. Seriously, this is a fun and entertaining film because it's a ""B"" flick. Take it for what it's worth...enjoy it for what it is! Thanks, Bill!"
3,Better with the sound off,"It looks great- but the various esperanto accents and iffy script are less than fantastic.I am working on rewriting the scripts and soundtrack so I can just use those when I watch it.And, yeah, who doesn't want to see a young Billie Shatner and the infamous Milos Milos- who knocked of Mickey Rooney's estranged wife and played a bit part in Here Come the Russians. Some say the movie is cursed, some say the people who watch it are."
3,Incubus,"IncubusThis movie was very well done. I was interested primarily because it's entirely spoken in Esperanto, but the pronounciations are off. Still, it was a beautifully done black and white movie, if ""beautiful"" can be used to describe a horror flick. The film quality was good, not fuzzy, and the audio was clear."
2,BEST ESPERANTO MOVIE....EVER,"Turn the sound off and do your own speaking parts and soundtrack.It looks great- visually appealing.I do love Esperanto, but the 8 different Esperanto accents are a bit confused. But heck, I like it. I am over the age of 13. Thank you."
1,Disappointing,"The movie is not in English and the quality of the film is poor - jumpy, scratchy. I watched maybe 5 minutes and stopped it as it was becoming too hard to watch the movie and read the very wordy subtitles at the same time."
4,magic,"This is a great read and I can reccommend it to anyone. I thought that it dealt with a lot of issues very effectively, eg teenage love, seeking independence from your parents, and finding a place where you belong in society. Melvin Burgess is a fantastic author and if you enjoyed this you should try reading 'lady' too which is as good, if not better than 'junk'."
2,Could have been so much better...,"The concept behind this book is great, but it was a dry and boring read. Instead of exploring many different things a dog might think or experience, the author just revisited a couple of different ideas over and over again."
4,Short quick and definitely worth it,"Your appreciation for this book will be increased if you've ever had a [bowel movement]job, ever had to watch as incompetent management destroyed every shred of morale and independent thought in their staff. It's really short, it's not a masterpiece and it's full of typos but what you get is pure content. There is no wasted space in this book. Practically every sentence has something for you, and that something is usually funny, ironic, or yet another tidbit to make you shake your head and say ""How did he ever put up with this?"" This one will stay in my permanent library of books I have too much of a connection with to ever throw away."
3,So awful it's good!,This is one of the best bad movies ever made. It's so disturbingly awful and yet somehow endearing. What more can you say of a movie with Dared-Elvis? It's a work of inspired madness. I'm surprised that it's not a cult hit of the likes of Rocky Horror Picture Show or Plan 9 From Outer Space.
4,DUUUUDE!!!!!,"Ok, let me get this out of the way... Fastforward through the first 10 minutes. That first ten minutes is what kept this movie from being a classic like the Rocky Horror Picture show, except you don't have to be stoned to enjoy it. They all almost fall to their deaths, the most memorable line is, ""Don't jump, you've got the car keys!"" and they decide to move to California.Now, we're at minute 11, fasten your seatbelts, this movie is about kick some ass, too bad Flea had to die to give the moviea point, but so it goes.What follows minute 11 is one of the great guy bonding movies of all time. I won't ruin it for you, but this is the movie for everyone who said the Big Leboski SUX!I'm killing half a star because it's not available on DVD, and anothe half star because of the first ten minutes."
2,Only works with 2 pins,"I bought one a while ago, and there was no mention that the product only works with 2-pin cables. If you have the ground too, it simply does not fit. Worst $9 I have ever spent."
5,Saves wear on electrical cords,"We purchased this so that we could move furniture closer to the wall. Just plugging electrical cords into a wall socket leaves you with the plug wire at a sharp angle and the furniture a couple of inches from the wall. Plug this into the wall socket and angle it down and then plug in your electrical cord and there is no bend in the wire and the furniture sits closer to the wall. Wish it could have been a little thinner, but it works fine."
5,"Strong, heavy jacks.","These jack stands are very sturdy and heavy, though not so heavy that you'll break an arm moving them under a truck.I would NOT recommend them for a car though. They're extremely tall at the lowest setting so you'd be lucky to have a jack that can push your car up to an agreeable height to get them underneath it."
5,Very reliable and well built,"I just couldn't trust my life under my Tacoma using the cheap versions from Harbor Freight, so I was more than happy to spend more on some quality jack stands at a reasonable price. They have performed well, no issues."
4,the original,"A good overall book. But it has some long passages in greek, latin and some other languages that if you don't read them you won't understand them. You will have to get them translated."
4,The Standard for Vampire Folklore,"Research into vampire traditions and folklore largely begins and ends with one man: Montague Summers! A Catholic priest and theater critic writing in early 20th Century England, Summers penned an infamous five-volume series on witches, werewolves, and vampires, in all of which he resolutely believed. Collecting tales, superstitions, and theological analysis from every corner of history and the globe, Summer's erudition and unabashed orthodoxy (as well as his unmistakable affection for the macabre) make his works into delightfully guilty and surprisingly educational pleasures."
3,"adequate, but no surpises","The information on vampires is useful, but the reading is dry.I'd hoped for a more interesting style, more stories,and more surprises.I haven't studied the subject in great depth and hoped to uncover unique twists.Perhaps my paranormal leanings over years educated me, so this work brought only smatterings of the new.Most of the information would be useful if you're unfamiliar with the subject.If you're well versed in vampires, the history and myth, this book may reiterate what you know."
2,Eton FR-250 Volume control goes bad after awhile,"We bought our first Eton fr-250 2 years ago. We liked it so much we bought another one(his and Hers). In about 10 months the first one would start getting louder and louder and out of control, volume control wouldn't function correctly. A few months later the 2nd one started doing the same thing, sporadically blasting the sound. My wife's brother had the same problem, so he bought another one. I called Eton tech support and they said I'd have to get it repaired somewhere. I can't believe we're the only ones who've had this problem and I think this is Eton's problem. Anyone else out there have similar problems?"
4,Good Radio To Have,"When I first tried out this radio, I was able to listen for at least a half hour without having to crank it up again. The one thing I noticed is that the longer it's cranked, the longer the radio lasts. The light also brightens longer, and the flashing LED works well, too. The siren is very loud, and it should only be used in extreme emergencies.Be warned that when cranking, don't overdo it. My mistake was cranking the device so fast that eventually the gears wore out and broke. Perhaps they should've used metal gears that last longer instead of the plastic ones, but I guess the lesson learned here is to never crank it so fast."
4,"Cute, compact radio.","The most fun you can have during a power outage. The LED lights are a wonderful addition to the radio, alleviating carring a flashlight along with it. A siren is also included. Just remember to use the antenna for the best radio reception. Highly recommend."
3,Eton FR250 - Not that great for the $$$,"Purchased the FR250 just 2 weeks ago and the volume control is already out - cheap components. Once the radio is turned on the volume continues to increase on its own, continue turning it down until the knob cannot be turned any more and it continues to get louder! OK for an emergency only radio, not a daily user. Hope it lasts a while."
5,Very useful and has held up well,"I've had this ladder for some time now and it's holding up really well, still in great working condition and we've used it a lot. It feels really stable when it's open and the steps are wide enough to be comfortable. The height is good enough for most needs around the house. It's metal so a little heavy but not too heavy for most folks to carry around. It's not too hard to open - make sure that it ""snaps"" that means it's fully open and locked. Closing is easy too, just pull up on the provided handle and it folds up again. I have no problems with it."
2,Lie Budget Movie,Its a low budget movie with kinda bad actors that don't know how to act gangsta and the more the movie played the more boring it gets.Its a waste of money don't buy.
5,Top of the Line-Whole Life,"Our cat, Ollivander will hunt all over the house for the pouch and will get an empty out of the trash. He becomes very vocal for this treat!"
4,Pretty interesting interviews,"I found this book while wandering in a book store and ended up reading almost the whole book in the store. Some rather interesting interviews, history, and insights from different masters...most still living. Aside from a few grammatical and typographical errors, its a good read with a number of quote worthy passages."
5,Booo-awesome!!!!,If you love Halloween like I do then you will love it too!!!! It gets you in the Halloween spirit!!!!
1,Very Cheaply Made,"Monopoly is fun to play. This review is for the maker and the physical quality of this Boo-opoly product. I don't think it deserves any star. The board, cards, paper, tokens and even the dice... Every time I saw them I have strong feeling to throw them in the trash. My kids want to give it a try only because it has a Boo twist in it. Luckily we have the peanuts version and other better quality versions of monopolies to leverage.In my opinion, this kind of low quality products should be banned. I have bought lots of good quality stuff on Amazon. I guess next time I should go to the retail store to check what I will get first before shoot the order. Lesson learned."
4,Go Hawkeyes,Love the blanket. Got it as a xmas gift for the hubs. This will keep us nice and warm this winter.
2,A disappointing book...,"I borrowed the book from my library (fortunately I didn't buyit) with great expectations. What I found it to be was a 300+page infomercial for Academic Finance. Bernstein is notmerely a cheerleader of Modern Academic Finance, but a Worshipper.His gods are messrs Markowitz, Sharpe et al. I returned the bookafter reading about 1/2 of it.The book is disappointing on several fronts :- It is completely biased in its treatment.- There is no mention of Behavioral Finance. Bernstein does noteven acknowledge the role psychology plays in the markets. Forthe gods and disciples of modern academic finance, the marketis always efficient. Which we know (by now) is pure Bunk.- There is nothing in the book about Ben Graham (and his studentsand followers), people who revolutionized the investing worldat least as much as the ivory tower theorists.Readers hoping to learn something useful from the book will besorely disappointed."
2,Flawed,"Again it is evident that acedemicians, whatever their field, will tend to embrace elegant, complex but flawed theories over simpler and more sound ones.The Graham and Dodd disciples (e.g. Warren Buffett) have shown that they can consistently beat the market indices by simply buying good companies at good prices."
4,good all-in-one,"I used this book to help teach a class. It has more than enough for a semester class to absorb, and all of the information is relevant, real-world and useful"
1,For highschool students - not for those who know how to draw,"I was expecting a book which would explain how to handle specific requests from the film directors. A book which would contain the ""tricks of the trade"" drawing solutions for the cameramen to understand ... it was an enourmous disapointment to me to find out that the book contained chapter after chapter talking about perspective and how to draw. The title is misleading and the drawings are rather dull. I would only recommend it to students with limited drawing knowledge and desire to storyboard. For me it was a waste of money."
3,Storyboarding,"""This is a good book to read if you want to understand the value of storyboarding in the filmmaking process."" -- RMS"
3,FOR STORYBOARDING ONLY!,"I'm sure this is a wonderful book for would be storyboard artists who work very closely with a director or very tightly to a script. Unfortuately as a comic book writer/artist that's not me. With all the wonderful prior comments I was sure this book would cover visual storytelling generally, but it has little of that. Nothing about creating drama through lighting or how to tweak each frame's composition to squeeze the most drama out of the situation. While the book discusses camera angles it does little to tell us how each of these angles has an effect on viewer. All in all this book is great if you just want to record someone else's script visually on to paper. If you're looking to understand the visual storytelling behind the script I would look elsewhere."
5,A Must Have!,"Marcie's book is an excellent, concise, and very well organized compendium for how to approach visual storytelling. Furthermore, this volume is supported with still images, drawings, and illustrations from classics in film history.I would highly recommend it as a textbook for both beginning artists as well as established professionals. Also, please pay special attention to the chapter dealing with composition, as it will allow you to enjoy, and hopefully design, films in whole new way.A must have!"
2,not satisfied,"The picture is misleading !!!! In the future if you are showing a picture of the Gold over Black version for sale do not send the silver over dark blue version to the buyer, That's not a very good practice."
4,Suitable to help prevent wrist strain,"I have a problem with my wrist when playing racquet sports and this works like an adjustable splint to help prevent wrist from torquing. Wrist still a little sore but that's because I have not lessened my power stroke and tennis serves. Will see doc next week, but this brace keeps me on the court."
3,Meh,"Not as supportive as I had hoped, but if you needed just a little support, then maybe they would be good. Not good for my situation."
3,Not too impressed,"I've been using this today and it seems to be ok although i'm not sure of its effectiveness with it riding down during the day.But all this is is a piece of elastic with velcro. Theres nothing else to it and thats pretty much it. I thought there would be a little more to it than this, especially since i own the kind that wraps around the thumb and that has metal in it to support the wrist."
4,Great Place to shop,I rec'd the item I order in great time. It was in great shape and was in time for Christmas. This company made one little boy very happy.
3,CUTE HISTORY OF CUBA IN A NUTSHELL: BUT VERY NAIVE,"If you want a cute, funny and witty History of Cuba in a nutshell, albeit a very leftist one, you will like this book. However, if Cuba were the Utopia portrayed by Rius, over 2 million Cubans would not have left this ""Socialist Eden""The book, ironically is not outdated, even though the Mexican Maxist cartoonist, Rius authored in 1970, as Castro has, through his stubborn old time Marxism, kept Cuba largely free of economic change, progress and consumer appliances which have (for the rest of the World) become commonplace since 1970s, like personal computers, cell phones, VCRS, dish washers, microwave ovens, and, OH, those Cubans lucky enough to own cars, mostly drive around in pre 1970, usually 1950s American chevy's."
1,This toy stinks,if you really want to waste your money on this do so. but the real Thing from the Fantastic 4 has black boots
3,Not really intermediate...,"This is more like a begginer DVD. If you don't know the scale shapes, then this DVD might help. If you know the shape but don't understand what it means or want to learn how to use it....NOT THE DVD FOR YOU!!!He says: ""Here's the shape""Then plays it slow....Then shreds all over the fretboard without any hint as to why he chose those notes or the rhyme or reason for what he's doing.He shows how to make barre chordes and some finger ""exercises"".If this is intermediate, I'd hate to see begginer....""Um der...these are strings...ummmmm, the vibrations make sounds....ummmmm....errrrr""This DVD is for the guy who wants to start playing."
5,Shaves like a new razor every time!!,"Easy to install, works perfectly and gives a nice clean, close shave. Bought this for my boyfriends who has had his Remington 85 for over 10yrs & with these new heads, he says it feels like it's a brand new shaver!! Thank you!!"
4,Return to Form,"This album is much more in the style of pre-famous TISM - the spoken word and throwaway [weak] tracks are mixed right up with the actual songs. It's pretty Australian lyrically, I dunno how many other countries would get the dry sarcasm, and musically it's as [weak] as you'd expect from TISM, but if you are a true TISM fan then [weak] is good. ..."
2,K-D Tools 2776,"Product received is NOT what is pictured as the item in listing.So I am STILL in need of, and looking for, the slotted tool (as pictured in the listing) to adjust my QuadraJet E4ME carburetor.If you too are seeking the slotted carburetor tool, what you see is NOT what you're going to receive."
2,eh..,"I bought these curlers for a trip to europe, mainly for the size and dual voltage. They were a huge disappointment for me, mainly because of the clips! It is true that the rollers are heavy. My hair is very thick, but even with minimal hair around the curler, the clips kept popping off. Once I got the clips to stay and left them on to set, I had clip marks left in my hair! The only way I could use them was to use the metal pins from my old set. Also, these plastic clips are not travel friendly. They take up almost as much space as the rollers. And my set did not heat up in 90 seconds at home or abroad. Sorry, but dont get these if you have thick hair or don't have a backup set of clips!"
1,No.,"I've used hot rollers for everyday styling years ago, but after going to a very short 'do, I eventually got rid of them. Lately 've been letting my hair grow out and decided to go back to trusty old hot rollers. Not much has changed, but I wanted to try a newer type of roller, one that dispensed with metal clips and I thought the grippy coating on these would be nice.I've thrown them out, having found them useless. First off - I don't think they get hot enough. Second off, the plastic clips they come with don't hold hair tightly - even if I managed to get them on tight, they quickly loosened and the rollers are then flopping around, unrolling. Even the best result I got was just nothing, nothing but a very slight volume, nothing that couldn't be accomplished with a little hair gel and a blow dryer.\Very disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this set at all."
1,Item pictured not the item that was receivedt,The item pictured is not the item I received. I love these rollers and I wanted the exact same thing when I reordered them. Instead I got them with plastic clip ons instead of metal pins. The plastic clip ons don't fit in the roller case and don't hold the hair as well. They are a nuisance to travel with. It took awhile to track down the people who sent this to me for a refund as there was no receipt included in the package. Too bad because the original rollers are great.
3,A little disappointed,The rollers take a long time to heat and the clips are not the greatest to use for the rollers. I was a little disappointed since I've bought Remington products before and had been happy with other purchases.
1,I hate the clips,"My rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set, regardless of me using more or less hair. Maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio. If so it is impossible to find. I dunno, but I do know I would NOT recommend these. Also even when I get these to stay in my hair, my hair doesn't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers. Overall buy something else."
1,Not For Long Hair!!!!!,These were not what I expected at all. The rollers were small and the comfort clips didn't even stay on the roller once I wrapped my hair around it. I used the rollers once (that was enough wasting my time) and they did not even curl my hair. My hair had not volume or body. These rollers not good for long hair. I returned this item and wish I had never ordered them.
2,Poor product,"I have to agree with the rest of the negative reviews. I purchased these curlers for travel, and their practically useless. First, the curlers are too heavy and do not stay in your hair. Second, the clips do not hold the heavy curler. Very disappointing :{. The good news, is that I have finally found a travel set which meets the needs of shoulder lenght hair or shoulder.The product I would purchase instead is the Conair Instant Heat Compact Styling Setter, Model HS 28. The Conair curlers are perfect for traveling & camping! I too am a big fan of the Clairol curlers from long ago. These Conair are the next best thing to the Clairol curlers."
3,Good rollers/ Bad clips,"I have had travel rollers like this before and like the size but mine aged and needed to be replaced. These arrived with some pluses and minuses. On the good side, they change colors as they heat so if any are loose from travel you can tell at a glance. The bad is that instead of the metal clips that work well and hold hair , they added plastic claw clips that do not hold on to the hair ( letting the rollers drop out) and the bag of clips takes too much needed space in your suitcase.It there is a place to order new metal clips it would be perfect."
5,Express set rollers,This product is very useful for at home use and traveling. The small size is convenient for packing.I use this each day. The size of the rollers is perfect for my short hair. I would give this product a 10!
5,Best Hair Rollers Ever!,"I had bought these hair rollers a few years back at a local Kmart and LOVED THEM. I only bought one set which contains 10 rollers. With only 10 rollers it takes a while to roll a full head of thick long hair so I knew I needed more. Well turns out Kmart, Walmart, CVS, Walgreens doesnt sell these rollers anymore which led me to look online. They are worth the process of ordering and waiting. They dont rip your hair or get tangled. They are pink and turn white when they are hot and ready. Very helpful, takes about 1 minute to heat up and they curl BEAUTIFULLY. Not like the other rollers that have the prongs around them and pull hair while taking them out. I would recommened all girls that need good rollers to get these. I now have 3 sets and it seems like a good number for a whole head of hair!!"
3,Good product except for the clips,"As said by others, the rollers are extremely heavy; the clips aren't really clips....more of a barrel and hard to get to stay in; and the rollers don't appear to get as hot as other sets. However, the color change is a VERY nice feature and even though they don't seem hot, in fact they are and the curl stays. I am going to buy clips to see if they work better."
3,In regards to Jennifer's review,"I simply wanted to coment on the review given by Jennifer. She complains that instead of the pictured set she recieved a pink and black set. Um, Jennifer, the picture IS a pink and black set. You said something about looking for a blue set so you bought this one. I'm not sure where you're logic is, perhaps you put your coment on the wrong page. I don't think Amazon is misleading at all, I think you simply made mistake."
2,The set that is sent is not the set shown in the picture,"The curlers that they send is not the set shown in the picture. I have been looking for the blue set with the clips shown , but that is not what you get when you order this product. You get a black and pink set that has different horrible white clips.I was very dissappointed. I already own this set and do not like it at all. I thought I was ordering the set shown in the picture. Amazon has been very misleading."
3,Roller Clips!,"This product works well making curls if you can get the clips to stay on the rollers. The old style had metal pins which kept the rollers in place. The plastic clips often fall off letting the roller fall out, leave clip marks (bend lines where the curl starts) on your hair and make the curler heavier. Great curl but bad clips. The curler set is quite compact and will take up little room in your bathroom and/or luggage. I think you can buy metal pins to replace the clips but then there isn't a storage area for them as in the previous model."
1,Aweful - what a shallow slut.,"This is the story of a girl who doesn't mature. Ten years after college, she's still searching for love. At the holidays she reflects on the boyfriends of her past and of the disastrous relationships, all revolving around Christmas. However, Madison is an unlikeable, shallow slut. She falls into bed immediately with any guy who sticks his tongue in her mouth. ""oooh, this must be love, we're having sex"" - is essentially what she's thinking. One Christmas, she has sex with 3 different guys. ick!I kept reading this poorly written novel with the hopes of seeing Madison mature and find her soulmate. But even after 10 years, she is still a shallow, self-centered, immature over-drinker. She only discovers her ""love of her life"" when she dumps him off on someone else, then gets jealous.Characters are underdeveloped, dialoge is oh-so-trendy, and the main character is thoroughly unlikeable. Pass on this drivel and read a real love story."

5,George perez is the Best!,"Amazing artwork! Great historys and a great moment in the comicbook history. I recomend to all. Grandes lembranas da minha infancia, as melhores historias dos Titas de todos os tempos."
5,Good bulb,Works well. Better than one from another company I bought where the ceramic cracked and sparks flew out of the bulb! This GE bulb is much better.
1,Shame no lenght provided for Bulb,"There a at least 2 lengths of T type bulbs and Amazon or its seller DOES NOT provide the information on this bulb length. I need the one that is just a tad over 3 inches, not the 5 inch model.GE at least calls them both ""T Type"" bulbs. So if you need the longer one, this is it. If you need the shorter one, do not waste your time and money on this bulb. Gave the one I ordered from Amazon to a neighbor as I had no use for it.Jim in So Calif"
2,broken,don't buy it. it is broken now. Just 100 hours I guess. I will try other brand next time. not worth to buy
2,Hmmm!,Was surprised that they have a very short life span! I am talking a few hours of operation on one of them. Not sure I would recommend them to others.
1,My mistake your gain,"Purchased this bulb to replace a burned out bulb. It was approx 1 or 2 millimeter too short (i.e, did not make solid contact with the spring loaded clamp these lamps have) so no light. Not sure if the bulb even works but since it doesn't fit snug I suspect no power is reaching it."
4,Keeps me dry and fits boat well,I purchased two of these; one for my Perception Acadia 11.5 and one for my Perception Prodigy 10. Both fit and work well at keeping water out of the kayak. The only negative is there is no adjustable bungee lock to adjust quickly but a knot tied in the back holds the skirt firmly to my kayaks.
4,Effective,This sprayskirt works as stated. I helps to control the amount of water that enters into the cockpit of the Kayak. This is a positive when on cool/cold water. Works well in early Spring and late Fall.
1,Batteries not included!,"Received the product and realized that the description FAILS to mention that you have to insert your own batteries for the unit to function as a flashlight! There are a number of other products that have rechargeable batteries and are much more practical. Furthermore, the nightlight brightness is so faint that it fails to provide any useful illumination."
1,GE 52508 Power Failure Nightlight/Flashlight,"I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PRODUCTTHE NIGHTLITE WORKS OK, HOWEVER THE POWERFAILURE LITEDOES NOT WORK AT ALL. CHEAP PRODUCT IN MY BOOK"
5,for the sound and the fury,"The Sound and the Fury is such a wonder of book, that I give this publication 5 stars just for providing us, finally with this beautiful edition. I haven't read the first three of these books, because they seem to be by an author who hasn't yet found his voice. Just to throw this out there, but I'd love to have his complete short stories (with notes) in this format. Don't you agree, Faulkner lovers?"
5,The Library of America's exquisite hardcover collection of four of William Faulkner's classic literary works,"Faulkner Novels 1926-1929 is The Library of America's exquisite hardcover collection of four of William Faulkner's classic literary works: ""Soldier's Pay"", ""Mosquitoes"", ""Flags in the Dust"", and ""The Sound and the Fury"". Like all volumes in this publisher's authoritative texts of literary classics, Faulkner Novels 1926-1929 is a compact hardbound volume with a ribbon for easy bookmarking sewn into the spine. A chronology and sections of notes on the text as well as Faulkner's life round out this definitive ""must-have"" edition, ideal for public and college libraries as well as private reading shelves."
3,taxes charge,"Dear Sr. I dont understand why I have to pay taxes on your product and dont have to pay if I buy others watches. If you realy have to charge me the taxes, I dont want to make the purshase."
3,If you're a counselor this may be up your alley,Far too much detail regarding the counselor's emotions etc. I wanted a story more in keeping with The Negotiator or The Guardian and this just went on and on. The definitely was not work 10. to me.
4,the Healer-O'Malley series,"I found this book the most difficult to read in the O'Malley series. Technically it isn't difficult, the topics are difficult. I think a little break between books may be appropriate before starting this one.I like Dee Henderson's books, she addresses issues fairly and with appropriate responses."
5,The O'Malley Series,This series is great! Read them all in order starting with the prequel. This particular one is especially good. The characters in this series are wonderful and you will be very happy that they will appear in more than one book.
5,HENDERSON CONSISTENTLY EXCELS!!!,"If you haven't read the other books, you will need to read them first in order to fully appreciate this book. Rachel is the one you turn to when life deals you a hard blow. She is the go-to girl in a crisis, capable of sharing your pain and lightening your load. Just two questions, how much can she absorb before reaching her limit? And, who does the go-to girl turn to?Once again, I find myself falling in love with each member of the O'Malley family and the friends that they have made along the way. Mrs. Henderson continues to show more and more of their past while painting such wonderful pictures of their future. I thoroughly enjoyed the men in Rachel's life.I can't wait for Stephen's story! Enjoy!"
4,Not as good as the others,"I liked this book. I've got the entire series on my keeper shelf, but I didn't like this one as much as the earlier ones. I felt like the relationship between Rachel and Cole dragged, especially since their relationship had already started in The Protector. I also thought the idea of a ""suprise wedding"" was a little far fetched.I also thought this plot was weaker than the other ones. There seemed to be less mystery and more tying up loose ends. It wasn't nearly as fast paced as the others. I still give the book 4 stars because I like Dee Henderson's writing, and I think fans of the series will like it."
2,Not Dee Henderson's Best,"I am a fan of Dee Henderson and have read every book she's written. However, I can't recommend this one. Even though I am familiar with the O'Malley brothers and sisters, I was confused by the numerous characters and the frequent switch in point of view. I like Henderson's characters, but think she would do much better if she stuck to a few and let the reader get to know them better. I also agree with another reviewer: don't read this book if you're upset or depressed. It will not cheer you up. Read some of Henderson's earlier work instead. Yes, bad things happen, but an entire book filled with them makes the ""escape"" aspect of reading this book almost nonexistent."
4,Not as good as the others,"I liked this book. I've got the entire series on my keeper shelf, but I didn't like this one as much as the earlier ones. I felt like the relationship between Rachel and Cole dragged, especially since their relationship had already started in The Protector. I also thought the idea of a ""suprise wedding"" was a little far fetched. I liked the book, just not as much as the other ones. I still think Dee Henderson is an incredible writer, and I'm sure I'll read this one again, just not as often as I read the others."

3,Tentative Review,"I've read quite a few biographies of Victoria, so eagerly awaited this one. The first thing I looked at was the family tree. I was dismayed to find a mistake in the tree!! There are TWO George II listed. Obviously, the second one should be George III. Who edited this book????? Makes me a bit suspicious of other content, but I will read the book, as I'm fascinated by all things Victorian."
5,Remington WDF-3000 Women's Smooth & Silky Shaver,I just received it today and have already tried it. I just love this razor! It shaves so close and takes no time at all.I recommend it very highly! You don't need to buy the WDF-5000.This is good enough!!
3,So-So,"This is my 1st electric razor and I thought it would shave as close as a regular blade, but it doesn't. Most areas you do have to go over several times which isn't time saving. But it's great when your regular razor is dull, you need to do a fast touch up before going to the beach w/out jumping in the shower. Be careful of underarm areas, it bites! It will pinch the skin sometimes and it is very painful and unexpected. I'm glad I have it (was a gift) but it could be improved. I already have to buy new screens for it because they puncture too easily. I dropped it in the shower and they are dented and a small hole in the screen is where I believe it pinches my skin."
2,"Nice shaver, but did not work for long","I received this shaver to replace a Norelco I had had for several years that was no longer working well. Initially, I loved the product. It was comfortable to use, and held a charge for a long time - it also shaved well. But after four months of use, the shaver just stopped working for no reason at all. I would not recommend it because of that. I could have just gotten a lemon though."
5,Very Pleased,"I've been using this product for a few years now and I'm absolutely thrilled with it. Not only does it do an exceptional job in and out of the shower, but it's amazingly safe while doing it! No nicks, no cuts, no pulled hairs, no pain. It's the first electric shaver that I've ever used that actually did what it was supposed to do; provide a close shave with minimum aggravation. I'd recommend this product to anyone."
1,Ouch! This thing hurts!,"I got this for Christmas, and I am extremely disappointed with this product. When shaving your legs it leaves hair behind, it's almost as if you haven't even shaved. And shaving your armpits is a painful experience. I just shaved mine and my armpits are bleeding and burning. It's a terrible product. I'll be returning mine shortly."
3,Ouch!!,"I've had this razor for about seven or eight years now and I use it now and then not to often because it hurts. When I'm shaving my skin it stings me and my hairs are not thick or long, there short and straight. When I use to shave my legs with it, it would leave scars on my skin and I would have to repeat the process about three times. It takes awhile to charge and also one time I was shaving and a hole ripped in the top net part. I like the cleaning supplies it came with, that's about it. The model I have is WDF-1400."
3,Battery issue,I was very excited to read the comments about this product but when I got mine I was a bit disappointed. Something wrong with the battery. I charged it and I was only able to finish off shaving one leg and then the battery died. Not sure why.
2,I returned it because it was defective item.,"I could not tell much about it because when I received it, it doesn't work after charged times. I returned it."
2,"Interesting Images, No Dialogue","I guess I was under the impression that there'd be some dialogue in this video. I was looking for a video that explained the history of the swastika and discussed it's previously ""good"" meaning in ancient religions to it's current ""bad"" meaning as a result of how it was used by the Nazis. However, this is just a CD of images, no dialogue, and is not something I'd recommend to a potential buyer."
3,Hate Kitchen Gadgets.....But Love the Lemonader!,"I hate stupid kitchen gadgets but I love my Lemonader! Everyone who's sick and tired of lemonade from a can or a powder raise their hand and then get one of these machines. You may have to play around with the recipes a bit before getting it just right for your personal taste, but that's part of the fun. It assembles easily and cleans up easily too. I prefer to transfer the finished lemonade into a different pitcher for storage in the fridge. For the money, it's a great little kitchen machine and the salton consumer relations department has been stellar in helping me replace a part that I lost. They're friendly and easy to deal with...kind of like the machine itself. Feel like having a bit of summer year 'round? Nothing like a fresh glass of lemonade to do that!"
4,Not bad... Really!,"I've read other reviews and thought that I'd give it a shot. I was quite impressed, overall. I didn't get burned with hot steam like others claimed, but I was extra careful. My unit fit together nicely and worked perfectly out of the box. I followed the recipes, and it seemed to work well. The one thing I will say (and it's a biggie) is that the pitcher is designed VERY poorly. The pouring spout wasn't made large enough, so A LOT of the finished lemonade will spill out when pouring.I've tried pouring the contents from the included pitcher into a larger pitcher (with a better spout) and it's worked nicely. I still will get some spillage, but it's better than using the included pitcher and a tall glass.Overall, the unit does what it claims to and the taste is pretty good!"
1,Big disappointment,"We were so looking forward to fresh lemondade. The moment the Salton arrived we opened the box, pulled out the lemons we had bought in anticipation and began juicing. On the 5'th lemon the gears stripped and the juicer no longer turned when applying even the slightest amount of pressure to the lemon. We were all very disappoined, my 5 kids and I : ( I had hoped for better after reading the great reviews written by some of the others."
1,Buy a juicer and make a quart of simple syrup,"Geez, what a waste of counter space. Someone thought they were doing me a favor giving me this machine. It's a pain to use. Much easier to just use my electric citrus juicer and pour in my own simple syrup. Here a quart of it costs about 75 cents. Tastes just the same and is ready in 5 minutes. This went to Goodwill after the first use."
4,Yummy!,"Even though it is time conusming and labor intensive, I love my new gadget. It makes the best lemonade ever. I usually juice a couple of limes also and have a very refreshing drink. It is also fun to operate."
4,what a great product,"The Lemonader is easy to use, easy to clean up and fun for the whole family. The lemonade is fresh and delicious. What a fun and inventive product. I highly recommend this for families with children of all ages and for anyone who likes fresh lemonade and other fruit drinks."
2,Great Lemonade Horrible Pitcher,"This little machine is great for making lemonade, limeade, orangeade or whatever takes your fancy. Only problem is the pitcher is so poorly designed no matter how careful you are while pouring you'll end up with as much liquid on the floor as in your glass."
4,Nice Collection!,"Although they only entered Top 10 just between 1970-1973, Chairmen of the Board remain one of the most memorable 70s soul groups because of the trembling voice of their leading vocalist and main songwriter, Norman Johnson! This CD includes all their hits and of course their Top-3 classic 'Give Me Just a Little More Time'!"
2,Cuts like seconds,These cutters are not as sharp as they should be. My husband has adjusted them so he can use them but would not buy them again. They perform like they are seconds
3,ONLY HALF WORKED,"The blade fit the Remington SF3 - the screen didn't. But I couldn't find it anywhere else, so I had to take the chance. Don't think it was worth [...] bucks, though. I've bought entire razors that cost less than half of what this blade/screen set cost, and they worked as well as the Remington razor it was supposed to fit. But, the Remington's rechargeable and saves on batteries, so I'm using the new blade with the old screen and it seems to shave pretty good..."
2,Paid to much,I paid to much for this clothes line. I found something similar and more effective at the local dollar store for 3 dollars. This clothes line started sagging after a few uses. I would not purchase this product again. And I still can not figure out why I purchased a clothes line on-line anyway. Silly.
1,Unhappy clothes hanger,"Not happy with this clothesline. Needs tightening every time and laundry still sags. No matter what we do, clothes are almost on the ground. I paid the extra money for this product but it does not meet rudimentary expectations at all."
3,Good book--but mostly repeats from earlier books,"I liked this book, like the color cartoons. I really think it should be disclosed in the book description that most of the book is repeats from earlier books, however."
2,Quality Testing sadly lacking.,The only reason I'm even giving this book 2 stars is because the content is fine. But in the 4 copies I've seen so far they obviously didn't bother to proof read. There are many duplicate and off center pages that were obviously printed wrong. If you're going to buy this (and you should it's great) buy a copy you can actually look at first to make sure it's okay.
2,When Will We See Laughter?,"Sure it took some artists a while for people to get used to them, but eventually they got better. Get Fuzzy has yet to progress to the point of being funny or acute or original. Maybe some strips did take awhile to find themselves, but after four years Bloom County, Calvin and Hobbes and Peanuts found their groove and were funny/original. A fine artist Conley may be, but he needs help in writing jokes and wry humor."
1,What is this?,"All ""Get Fuzzy"" proves is that there is a dumbing of America. How can people begin to say that this predictable strip is original and thought provoking. I think that people are in a haze when they say that it is in no way like ""Garfield""! Give me a break! ""Get Fuzzy"" would never have been created if it were not for ""Garfield"". Also, if the creator of ""Get Fuzzy"" would come up with some new ideas he might get his creation to grow. Lately all it has done is stayed within the apartment. Where's the growth of the characters? I am still confused over the lost fang episodes, did Bucky lose the fang or not? One day he still has the fang, the next day he does not. One day he has the fang, the next day the ferret has it. What gives? This is a bad strip!!"
5,Hysterically Funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Darby Conley has successfully introduced the next great strip in the vein of ""Calvin & Hobbes"" meets ""The Far Side"". This strip is a riot even if you hate pets - I have copies of many of the strips on my office wall. Buy this ""Treasury"" version as it contains all the strips from the previous 2 ""Collections"" and is only a little more expensive."
2,"Be aware, this book has virtually no new content","Groovitude *combines* the first two Get Fuzzy books, and adds some sunday color. If you already own the previous books, you will be unhappy. Seeing as I got all three at the same time, I was disapointed. Get it as a gift for someone who doesn't already own the others."
5,Hilarious cartoon if you like it!,"First off, I will not compare Get Fuzzy to Garfield or Peanuts or whatever everyone else says about it because there are already lots of reviews like that.Personally, I think Get Fuzzy is one of the funniest comic strips I have ever read. But from seeing all the reviews, it is obvious it is one of the cartoons that people either like alot or hate. I will not say you have to be ""smart"" or anything to understand the sometimes subtle humor in these strips, it is just that you have to be the type of person that thinks its style of jokes are funny. I would strongly recommend you read a few Get Fuzzy strips on the internet before you buy the book, just to see if you like it or not, since it is free and you would have nothing to lose.Get Fuzzy is really clever and funny, just be sure you don't hate it before you buy it."
1,Do not order this on Kindle,It is impossible to read or clearly see the the book. Some books are not suitable for kindle. I suspect all books like this one fall into that category.
1,What power?,The Power 2000 ACD 260 was purchased as a back-up for our Canon NB-5L battery. What a disappointment. Under equivalent conditions the Canon brand battery holds enough charge for seveal hundred pictures using our 800is camera. The Power 2000 knock off battery is lucky if it gets us through a dozen before needing a re-charge. It is also very sensitive to cold conditions. After a fresh charge it will not even take one picture if the temperature is below freezing. Don't waste your money buying knock off batteries. After a year of frustration we are buying the real thing before our next vacation.
3,"Boy, does Klevar cut Caldwell slack....","The main points of the review: the writing is good and Klevar's research and citations are thorough. Yippee--I love that in a biography. Though not a hagiographer, Klevar excuses Caldwell the inexcusable based on unlikely reasoning. For instance, Caldwell's ""sense of duty"" required him to leave one wife after another to ""make an honest women"" of his mistress of the moment. Huh? This bit of (unnecessary) bowlderdization diminishes Klevar's otherwise competent exposition of Caldwell as a man and a storyteller."
4,Entertaining and easy to listen to,"I don't know if I agree that Bowling for Soup is the ""funnest band"" I've ever heard (as their promotional materials state), but their music is catchy and easy to listen to. There are more ""hooks"" in the first cut on this CD than a lot of bands have in an entire career. Bowling's sound is quite a bit on the pop side, especially the harmonies, whose repetitious sound tends to grate on you after awhile. Also, the first five or six cuts are stronger than the later cuts. But it is a nice, pleasant CD."
3,War Party? Hmmmm...,"I've been a hardcore GWAR fan since Scumdogs and I have to say, while GWAR trumpets this as their heaviest album to date, it is not my favorite. There are some catchy songs (and some decent riffs) on War Party, but overall, there's not much to write home about. If you want heavy GWAR, go with Scumdogs of the Universe, America Must Be Destroyed or 2001's Violence Has Arrived (which is not only heavy, but catchy and melodic). On top of all of that, I was disappointed in the lack of solos.I'm sure War Party will grow on me, but for now, I have to give it three stars and say, check out some of their earlier stuff instead."
3,A bland continuation of their previous album,"After GWAR's incredible 2001 release ""Violence Has Arrived"" a new standard for the band was set. They've had great albums before, but none so hard and heavy and metal as VHA. War Party delivers the same flavor as VHA, but unfortunately without all the punch and originality that made the previous album rock so hard. There are some good tracks to be heard, but the majority feel derivative and copy the same sounds over and over without having any signature riffs or solos of their own.War Party makes a good backdrop for their latest tour, but I doubt you'll want to listen to it in your car when they have more interesting albums available (I recommend each of them, except for Ragnarok and Carnival of Chaos). Let's hope the band returns to its tradition of trying new styles with each album, instead of trying to mine more than they apparently can out of this newfound metal sound."
3,"Good metal, a few silly liberal messages","Obviously not fans of the current Administration, Gwar has started putting in lyrics laced with jabs at the government while leaving out their normal toilet humor. Sadly, that is what is missing from this album and why it didn't get more stars. There are some good songs here, however. I think the main thing most people overlook is that Gwar is a talented metal band and Oderus has a very original sounding voice. Hopefully with the next release, they will leave the politics to the professional dopes like Susan Sarandon(note: susan don't make any albums) and get back to the filthy mcfilth they are loved for."
4,ALL HAIL GWAR!,"As a longtime GWAR fan, I must say this CD truly ROCKS!I can see why the new, harder edge may alienate fans of the comedy-era Gwar, but I can also see an album like this bringing in new fans, as well. Damned if you do and damned if you don't, right?Awesome vocals, killer guitars, and mega-drums throughout definitely make this CD something that should be played LOUD. You'll need the lyric sheet to grasp the lyrics the first few times around, as this isn't really a sing-a-long record. Regardless, songs like WOMB WITH A VIEW and KROSSTIKA may get you in trouble if you sing them out loud on the bus."
4,gwar finally learn to play their instrument-ohm musical instruments-oh you know!,"gwar once was a great stage show of a band with the music a distant third to the stage show and lyrical content but this cd they prove they are,can be musicans they could give up gore and stand on a stage uncostumed and play music with the big boys."
5,Works Great,"I found it very helpful as I can use it my mobile as well as my digital camera and also on mu computer. It is a good product to transfer movies and songs from one device to the another.On a whole, It find it helpful."
4,"great card, slow transfer to a nokia 770",so far the card has worked fine in my nokia 770.The transfer rate to the 770 is very slow. I am going to get a card reader and transfer files that way and see if it is faster.
2,nokia 770 internet tablet no no,this is a great flash card with a buttload of space on it but my internet tablet doesnt recognise it :( but i can use it on other things like my digital picture frame! not a big loss...
5,2GB MMCmobile Dual Voltage 1.8V/3.3V Memory Card,Had to wait a little bit for delivery but when I got it just as described great product works great with my NOKIA 770.
5,Godliness,This product provokes a deep sense of spirituality in me as I am sure it would for others. Playing gospel music in the form of rock music has a special appeal for me.
5,Christian music,I had seen it on TV so I already knew what to expect music wise. I recevied it in a timely fashion and it was new.
3,Three good songs,My wife wanted this collection after seeing it on a TV commercial. There are only about three good songs on this entire collection. Amazing Love is the best followed by open the eyes of my heart and the third I cannot think of right now. I would just buy the good ones from itunes.
1,"Ugh, absolutely awful","This is some of the worst tripe I have ever listened to in my life. Listening to this made me want to stab my ears out. I can't understand how pathetic people are who actually find inspiration in this awful, awful music. I feel diluted having just listened to this. Please, buy this only if you are an emotional wreck. People who use logic need not apply."
3,Inaccurate Product Description. English dubbing not present.,The description lists this as Japanese with English subtitles and dubbing. There is no English audio track. This package is Japanese with English subtitles only. I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 4 due to the inaccurate product description.
4,about time,one of the best anime never translated to english. it should be noted that is is only subtitled in english. a great series.
1,Rolling On or Flushing Down?,"If I could return this, I would. The first 10 minutes of this one hour video was devoted to Elvis and the Beatles. The remainder looked like a home movie or surveillance video in black and white, showing the same clips over and over again with very poor video and sound quality. It covers the first 10 years of the Stones and features just a few songs being performed as well as some interviews and a bit of Mick's early acting career. I am a HUGE Stones fan, and this was painful to sit through once. I will never watch it again!"
3,Duplicate Case,"I bought this case to hold and protect my Shure E4c earbuds. I did not know the E4c's came with a similarly sized round case, or I would not have purchased this one. The case that was supplied with my E4c's is one undivided space. The EA622, the same size, contains a plastic reel. The intent is for the user to wind the earpiece cord onto the reel. An opening in the center of the reel stores the earpieces. I prefer the original undivided case. I quickly coil-up my E4c around my fingers and place the headset into the original case. It takes me longer to wind my cord around the internal reel. A plastic rivet fastens the reel in the EA622 case. Works fine, if you don't mind the reel divider."
1,STAY AWAY!,"Total garbage, not at all what was depicted. What came was a case with no interior wind, something I could have picked up at the dollar store. I had the case that was depicted, a hard protective nylon case; what came would remind you of the world's cheapest sunglasses case. I don't know what the disconnect is between what the other people received and what I received but it appears they have run out of the real EA622 and started subbing in this worthless new case. For what its worth, the ""invoice"" that came with the package was all written in Chinese. Avoid this seller."
5,Movie Review,"Arrived right on time as promised. I haven't seen this movie in many years, but I always enjoyed it. Its based on an old story called ""Men of Iron."" It follows the book fairly well."
5,Delightful,"I got this in the mail today and was delightfully surprised: The digital mix is great, the colors luminous and lush and the story doesn't sag in the middle! What fun! (I've read some negative things about this production but I would counsel to ignore them.) Technically you can enjoy this without it breaking down into window pane pixels or slowing to a stop towards the end and it's great entertainment. You can completely forget the bills and what Congress is doing and suspend reality for the length of this film and enjoy it with the kids! It's got it all: Romance, knights in shining armor, horses, a cause at stake, a family secret, beautiful ladies in courtly clothes, and villians abound. When I want to be taken away I'll be reaching for this flight of fancy instead of the Calgon!!!"
3,Too high of a price for what you get,"I love this movie but I was really disappointed with what I got. I paid $17.99 for this classic movie on DVD and only I got was just the movie. NO bonus features, no screen selection, nothing else. you get more from an old movie the $5 bin at Walmart. I paid less for other old movies at amazon (i.e. robin hood with earl Flynn) and received way more features.Amazon should lower the price on this movie and refund money to the people that have already bought it."
2,kiddie stuff,"When knights were bold. Silly 'spectacle"" with cardboard sets and obvious mat paintings. Transfer is widescreen with vivid color but movie is best for undemanding youngsters."
1,Dud,"When I tired to play the video, it wouldn't work on my machine.How do I return it for a replacement?"
5,AVAILABLE ON BLURAY IN GERMANY,"This film is available in Germany from Amazon Germany,for about $22 on BLURAY.A superb 2.35 CinemaScope print. Excellent quality etcThe print came from the Universal vaults and is probably the same master they are using in the USA.Top Quality. ALL REGIONS CODEDAlso from Amazon UK."
4,The Black Shield of Falworth,"The first time I saw this movie it was many years ago. It was in black and white. In 1989 it aired on TV in Technicolor. As a part time history buff, and a part time smith, alot of the things in this movie were very accurate. I wish I had more time now, to see it again with friends for the first time again uncut. It truely is a great movie. Some of the scenes will put you down from laughing, and others will have you gripping the seat cushions for fear and excitement. If you want to see a technical bluper what the hankerchief. The best thing I can say, is though the actors seem a little young (at the time), they had one of the best director's and some of the best (enspiring) young actors of any age."
1,Black Shield of Falworth,"I feel that I was ripped off by another movie company (what's the odds). I paid for a DVD, what I got was a movie without any extras on a DVD-r that I could have recorded myself from any movie source. I collect films and as such was expecting a stamped DVD for my collection. DVD-r is a cheap way of getting top dollar from buyers with very little cost to the company, they don't last and are very easy to damage, in short, a rip-off the collector. Next time I will buy from a pirate, at least you know what you are getting and are not paying $20.00 plus dollars for a movie that a couple of years ago would have been released for around $10.00 on a long lasting stamped DVD. What a bunch of crooks. They whine everytime to the courts if student rips them off, but they figure it's fair game to rip-off consumers everyday. The movie companies are the biggest crooks in the American market."
3,Fun as ever,"I first saw Black Shield of Falworth in 1960. It was fun and enjoyable then. Yes, Tony had his Brooklyn accent but he was havingfun and just serious enough to keep your interest. Janet Leigh was beautiful and well she was a wet dream come true.This movie is a wonderful example of Swashbuckling, Hollywood style.Wish there was some added features about the making of this movie."
5,The Black Shield of Falworth,Got the DVD in good time and in shape as promised. Been waiting for Tony Curtis movies to come out.
4,Those flippin' american accents can drive you nuts,"Good family movie with good hard sword fights for the boys, beautful princesses for the girls, solid story for mum and dad and splendid backdrops. Go on, go on, oh go on buy it, it's what you dreamed of being when you played knights and castles as a kid."
4,Tony Curtis,"I first saw this movie when I was 10 or so (many years ago) and fell in love with it. I soon discovered that it was based on the book Men of Iron by Howard Pyle and, as it turns out, is quite a faithful screenplay. Tony Curtis' accent does not detract from the quality of the film - there are, at least, no pretentious faked English accents. The action is honest and open. The colour and sound are excellent. Probably the best performance is by Torin Thatcher as Sir James Lee. A terrific, old fashioned adventure."
2,Is This Really Kona Beans?,"I had an expectation of the quality and taste of beans received before from Hawaii, specifically Lion Brand. I've now tried these beans for 4 days, and my partner and I are grossly disappointed. It is flat, tasteless, and lacks ""punch"". Anything but ""gourmet"". I would never order again, if I could return the unused beans, I would! Quite expensive, also!"
5,UB3R Leash with Bling for your pooch!,I purchased a dozen of these after I recieved my first two! These are the most beautifully crafted leashes in the world! They look so k3wl when walking your dog at night and all my neighbors are in love with them and always are amazed at how they llok! They blink red/blue/white back and forth and shine brightly at night and can be seenn down the street. I sewar my dogs now love going for walks even more now once they see me fire up the leashes as they know everyone that sees them compliments them and gives the dogs attention.
4,Perfect,"Fits in small space very well, light weight, sturdy. Not very easily folded up and down though, I just leave it folded down, it fits great in a corner of my kitchen slightly under the sink, not in the way like I was worried it might be since I'm very limited in space at my apartment, but it works great!"
4,Good sound for less,"This device is a good use for music, internet radio and video MP4s / movies. But it's only for the ones who have PSP1000 (phat). PSP2000(which I have) and PSP3000 won't fit the headphone output. But it will recharge and that's it. But this is a good buy, the sound is great, bass and all. If you have the PSP1000 GET IT!"
5,really good for the price,i like this thing it has good bass response its pretty loud and it charges your psp which i was unaware of when i bought this speaker set which gave it a good plus in my sense although one small flaw it has an annoying high-pitch sound when it not playing anything its not very noticeable but its still there the sound quality itself is really good all things considered. this is the best speaker set for your psp i've heard for the price its an excellent buy i feel as if the product to make costs more than its sold for but thats my opinion
2,Merely adequate,This product serves the purpose as a speaker for your system. So if that is all you need then it's the right product for you. There are better products that have remote controls. If you want something that doesn't feel flimsy and fragile then this isn't the product for you.
1,Don't go horizontal!,"I bought this rotisserie when my vertical [] rotisserie wore out. I wanted the Foreman product [] because it advertised that is would hold a bigger bird - and I had trouble getting an 8 pound bird in my vertical rotisserie. After two separate attempts at roasting a 7-8 pound bird, I have decided this rotisserie is not worth using. The biggest problem was that you MUST tie up your bird so that the wings and legs don't flop over and start a fire on the heating elements. You must be very, very good at tying birds to keep the parts from working loose when the bird rotates. Gravity definitely works against you here. I decided to use the rotisserie simply for shish kabobs and cooking foods in the baskets; however, the kabob setup is very cumbersome and not worth the effort. I plan to purchase another vertical rotisserie. Better to buy compact birds than to learn how to rope tie a bird!"
2,Rotisserie,"We did not like this at all, it seemed like it took for ever to cook a chicken. We just didn't care for it."
3,I hope it dont break !,"I bought a baby george last year and i loved it. It makes the best chicken and pork loin youll ever have. After about 20-25 uses the motor went out. man was i upset , I had to finish cooking my meal in the oven. Most chicken you find are either going to be right under or right over 5 lbs. Regardless it broke and I threw it away. So this year I decided to buy another one. So im happy again and eating good. The george jr is rated for upto a 10 lb turkey. However I think im going to try to limit the weight to around 6 to 7 lbs. I dont want to burn out another motor. I would also suggest that when you put the meat in the oven, slide the bar to the right and make sure the gears are making good contact with each other. It cleans easy, it looks good, and your dinner will be tender and juicy. MMMMmmmmmm !!!"
1,Fatal Flaw,"For my first time using the George JR I grilled 2 chickens without trouble, but could not grill 2 potatoes in the basket because the gear kept slipping. Thinking about it its obvious that the lack of any mechanism to latch the 2 gears together a major flaw. Anything that has the potential be off balance, like almost anything in the round basket, will cause the gear to slip. It would have been really simple to have a catch or lock that prevented this......"
1,Flimsy goes to dumpster soon.,"After four cookings/cleanings, all four spikes and the center spear are moving like loose teeth. Pour mechanical design. Can it be returned for some form of credit?One star for easy cleaning."
2,Portable space heater that cooks chicken,"Excellent product for heating your home in the winter. Does a good job with chicken too, but so does my oven and my oven doesn't put out nearly the heat that this GR82B puts out.Like most kitchen appliances, what you save in convienence, you lose in cleaning. It is easy to clean, but it does require a little extra time and effort to do a proper/sanitary cleanup.On the PLUS side, this GR82B seems to have better constructed parts than most of the other George Foreman appliances. In summary, the GR82B cooks great, cleanup is so so.... and the appliance should only be used during the winter (cold) months.UPDATE - Against my advice, spousal unit purchased one as gift for her niece (July 1st 2005). The poor girl returned it for a store credit after turning it on to test it.... puts out way too much heat for a counter top kitchen appliance she says."
2,Small Birds Only,"This rotisserie will not actually do an average thirteen pound bird. In fact, it can not accomodate the average ten and a half pound bird, which is the first size I tried and ended up having to revert to my oven. Believe me, I spent over an hour situating it every which way and it simply doesn't fit. I guess I'll have to stick to seven or eight pounds (do turkeys come that small?) I just wish the ads would have been more straightforward instead of making grandiose claims the machine can't live up to. I suppose you could find, with a lot of searching, a small in size but extremely dense turkey---but that is absurd."
3,Heats up your kitchen WAY too much,"The 1st night I had this I used the round basket to cook frozen french fries for 30 minutes. The oven produced so much heat- more than I was anticipating. I had it on my kitchen countertop and the cabinet above it got REALLY hot. This thing is not insulated AT ALL. This is not an appliance I'd use in the hot summer months, and I can't imagine leaving my house while it was on for fear of it catching fire. I can't imagine how much heat it would have created in my kithen had I used it to cook a roast for 3 hours. The fries tasted like I'd baked them in the oven, not bad but not worth the heat in my kitchen. My oven is better insulated. Back it goes!"
3,A decent primer,"Ralph Moore writes from his experiences church planting in Hawaii with the Foursquare denomination. His perspective in this book (not to mention his theology) is very obviously shaped by his formative spiritual experiences in the Jesus movement of teh 1970's. The first half of the book is slow, but the second half is much better."
3,Review by a beginning violinist...,The sound is not as clear as I would like it be when blowing through it. This can be difficult for a beginning violinist who is trying to tune the instrument on his/her own.
2,"Not durable, soft sounding","The E note went very flat after only a few months of (ab)use by my six-year-old daughter. Granted, she blows the notes a little too hard, but that's because the 4 notes sound very soft and fuzzy, especially the D and the E. I suspect there are better pitch pipes out there."
2,Good enough - but only if you don't ever use the trimmer,"I've had it for a bit under a year - no real problem with the blades, and the trimmer is decent as well, but if you use it, stubble will fall down into the locking mechanism that holds the trimmer down when not in use. Within 3 months it builds up to the point that it prevents the locking tab from engaging, meaning you'll have the trimmer in the way 100% of the time - and all the washing/shaking in the world won't dislodge it; its disassembly time. 6 small screws and a couple of pieces that are pretty nasty to hold in place while reassembling."
1,Not recommended,"The trimmer on this product is wonderful, but that is the only good thing about it. This Remington does not shave close at all! I don't recommended this product to anyone who wants to use it for more than just a trimmer."
2,Disappointing Shaver,"I bought one of these, having enjoyed my previous, although simpler Remington shaver. I was disappointed in the Microscreen 3 TCT. I found it impossible to achieve a close shave without scrubbing at my face. The latch for the popup trimmer also was problematic. It was hard to lock in retracted position and kept popping up unexpectedly. I have used electrics now for more than 40 years and understand their limitations, but this one did not measure up."
2,WORST ELECTRIC RAZOR I'VE EVER OWNED,"I had this razor for a year and just threw it away. From the start, the beard trimmer would pop-up unexpectantly. After six months, the trimmer wouldn't lock back in at all. If the battery were dead, I couldn't just plug the razor in the wall and use it; I would have to wait several hours for it to charge up. It had difficulty cutting just two days of stubble. The foils are not particularly durable. The rear foil in particular would develope a massive hole every 2-3 months. This is the first electric razor I've owned that was truly a piece of junk."
2,Poor quality,Remington is no longer made in the USA and it shows. The 1st time I used it the screen ripped and it cut a gash in my face. Luckily I had an extra screen - and peroxide. I wrote to Remington who never replied. I've since used it over 1 year and found the screens weaken quickly. Also shortly after purchase the trimmer wouldn't retract. On the good side there is the shave itself which is close and comfortable and the charging is quick. However since the screen tore again (I saw it this time before shaving) I've decided to go for the Braun equivalent.
1,Doesn't shave well at all,I bought this to shave my legs (women's razors are just rubbish at this) and it's awful. It takes me twice as long to use this electric razor as it would with a wet blade and the results are very disappointing. Don't waste your money!
2,MS3-1000 has same trimmer problem,"I have an MS3-1000. Same problem with the trimmer as everyone else: trimmer won't stay down. I'm buying a new razor. Otherwise, it works well (except that with the trimmer all the way up, you can't shave with it.)"
2,Good shave but trimmer does not lock down,I've used my MS3-2000 for almost 2 years now. The shave I received from it has always been quite good.The problem with the trimmer not locking down started happening to it within 3 months of use. I called customer service and they said to make sure you clean it well. This really means to use the brush and get in there to clean it.This resolved the trimmer not locking until about 3 months ago. Then it took brute force to make it lock down.Now it does not lock down whatsoever. I just bought a Norelco.
2,Mediocre at best.,"Maybe a 2.5 but just barely. I needed a new electric for everyday quick morning shaves since I tend to have a five o clock shadow at 2pm. As others have said, I might as well just use a regular razor as it would be quicker and probably with less razor burn. Just to get the hair down reasonably low it takes forever. I don't expect an ultra close shave with electric but geez. On top of that, the cutters tend to let hair fly everywhere. Its back to Norelco for me as it least I don't have to clean the thing every bloody day. The Remington really needs to be cleaned after each shave and its not as simple as running the head under the water. I'd look elsewhere for a decent everyday shaver."
2,Pop-up Trimmer broke after 2 months,"At first I loved this shaver. It cut fast and real close. Nice. But now after just 2 months, the pop up trimmer won't stay down. This means you burn through the battery charge real fast and you scratch up your face all the time unless you hold it down with your thumb. Time to go back to a Norelco..."
2,"Some useful material, but basically I'm sorry I bought this","This DVD seems to be oriented to the hard-rock wannabe crowd that already hangs around bands and their gear, and just needs something to build their skills a little (and their confidence). Certain knowledge was assumed, and in my opinion the material covered wasn't that much. I guess for some folks it would be perfect, but if I'd been able to preview it (or read a review like this one), I'd never have bought it. The other DVD I got (""Live Sound Reinforcement"") was *way* better, and the folks who got to see both DVDs all agreed."
4,Good start,Generally Rock House DVD are excellent. This is good start on how to mic instruments including vocals.
3,stinky poop,"I wanted to get this food because the price is more reasonable as compared to my cat's normal food, Science Diet Indoor Formula. I bought a small bag to try it out, and I'm glad I did, because I'm not buying it again for the fact that it makes my cat's poo ridiculously smelly! Even though I clean the litterbox near daily, wipe it down with cleaning wipes, use sanitizing spray on it, and have an air purifier clsoe to it, I can STILL smell when he has gone to the bathroom. The cleaning combination was effective when he was on Science Diet.If it doesn't make your cat's poop smell something fierce, then this is a great deal. The product has good, all natural ingredients, and is inexpensive compared to the other brands."
3,Remington WDF 5000,arrived on time. haven't used it yet -- was a gift. wasn't the razor that i thought that i had purchased at first.
2,Charge does not last long,"My mother bought this for me to replace my 10 year old Norelco. It has a nice concept, but I found it did not shave very well. In the shower, it did absolutely nothing. Out of the shower it did OK. The shave didn't last very long, and in some areas it really hurt. The charge does not last very long. It seems like it takes at least a few hours to charge it fully and you have to charge it after every use. I have gone back to my old Norelco. This shaver is not for me."
3,not the razor for me,"I have thick hair, and this razor gave me razor burn and ingrown hairs every time I used it over the course of three months. Also the blade in it seems to get dull fast, as the shaving got worse, not better. I specuale that this is because I have senstive skin and coarse hair. I have since switched to waxing since it is overall less painful for me."
2,Close shave but takes too long,"Like many others, I decided to buy an electric razor in the hopes of saving money, since blades are so expensive. So...I read all the reviews and decided this was the one for me. I read the instructions carefully, fully aware that it might take 2-3 weeks for my skin to adjust. However, I had no problem getting a good, smooth shave the first time, without any irritation whatsoever. My biggest disappointment was how long it took to get a smooth shave. You have to shave alot slower with the electric than with blades. I shave my legs every day, and with a blade I can finish in 5 minutes. The electric razor took 20 minutes! Unacceptable!!! I'll continue to spend the bucks on blades rather than spending 2 hours a week to shave. I returned the product for a refund."
1,Womens WDF 5000 razor by Remmington,"This Razor was bought for my mom. She tried it for about 3 weeks & it didn,t shave well at all. It was very loud compared to herold razor & didn,t even seem to do anything. I would not recommend it at all to anyone. .... Look for another Brand. I:ve had good luck withsome of the Panasonic Brand."
2,it's not THAT great..,This electric razor was one of the worst things I ever purchased. It doesn't cut very close and I advise you just to use a regular razor. It's impossible to shave the underarms and bikini area with this.
4,Not bad for an electric.,"I've read some of the reviews here and luckily have not experienced any kind of problem with the razor or my skin. I have been using an electric razor for in-between shaves for 15 years and this one is wonderful. I take it to the beach with me. The only thing I can recommend: Be CAREFUL if you use this on your underarms. I did find it a bit rough and will not be trying that again. However, it is wonderful for legs. It isn't as clean of a shave as with a razor but your legs will pass the visual inspection every time. It works pretty well on parts of the bikini area. It just takes time and practice to get the best results I think. I would definitely recommend this razor to women who prefer to use an electric every now and again."
4,The Best,"This is the best shaver I have ever used, on my first try it was smooth slick and easy to handle and glide. The only problem I had was mild irritation, but that was only because it was my first time, and my skin is sensitive. Remington is easy to take care of and maintain. When I first thought I would use an electric shaver I thought it w0uld be complicated. I read the instructions and it was simple.The best part was it didn't hurt, i never cut myself, most non electric shavers cut and leave scars. This one did none of that."
2,ehh...,Not that great. The video lessons that come with the latest version of Garageband (for free) are better than this DVD. Not very easy to follow along with. I can find better stuff online for free... Good thing I only paid $6 on here...
4,good stuff,i have this dvd & found it to be a must have for any beginner guitarist wether you want to play the blues or not. john mcarthy gives some good tips and sound advice aswell as being a good teacher. i recommend. i would have given it a 5 star but i think it is a tad too pricey.
1,"Poor quality, turned PC updsidedown, virus??",Poor quality software didn't work properly. First try it turned the entire screen up-side-down and backwards! Head to look up a cure online to fix my PC. On Windows 7 it worked but in a tiny screen version with extremely poor graphics.
1,Boot stretcher,This boot stretcher simply will not work in a western boot. For the handle to turn and expand the foot it must have two (2) universal joints.
3,Check application chart,"The title says it is for Fords from 1994 to 2008. It fits various Fords within those dates, but not all. 2005-2008 Super Duties will need a different harness."
4,"Good dictionary, once you learn the quirks","The dictionary itself is quite good, offering multiple uses of words in context. It's also easy to use. The caveats: read the instructions when installing! I didn't, and had to reinstall. Second, it can interact and interfere with the cut-and-paste function (actually, anything using the Microsoft clipboard.) Once you learn those quirks and how to handle them, the dictionary is an asset."
5,Compatibility issues?,"Can anyone tell me if this CD-ROM is compatible with Windows 7? I have an older edition of the dictionary that is no longer compatible with the new Windows software, and wanted to make sure this 2003 edition of the CD-ROM will work on my new laptop. Any info is much appreciated. Thank you!"
4,Most decent dictionary,"The Oxford Spanish dictionary has so far brought me nothing but satisfaction. I was looking for a way to check Spanish words and expressions on the fly, as I work on my computer. I am so far truly impressed with the consistent quality of both the Spanish and English entries. The speaking function leaves a bit to be desired, though it does give the user at least an approximation of how a word should be pronounced. Also, the search functions make this dictionary one of the fastest Spanish language tools I have ever used. Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this electronic dictionary to anyone."
1,Poor User Interface - Not Win7 Compatible,"I should have read reviews more carefully.This is an old product (copy-write 2003) but user interface is more like something from the mid 1990's.Doesn't copy the dictionary to disk although it's only 1 CD-ROM (read above comment... remember how small hard drives were 20 years ago?)I was able to run it once on my Win 7 laptop and now get license errors every time I try to open it.No email response to query from oxford press ""customer service"".I will try to return but I've opened the packaging.This product is extremely obsolete and should be removed from the market."
2,Pitiful,"Many entries don't even begin with a definition. Rather they begin with usage examples. The copy & paste function is very inconvenient. Oxford doesn't even offer updates, rather repair patches that are complicated to install. If I type in the word ""anger"", the program shuts down."
1,The Oxford Spanish Dictionary on CD-ROM: Windows Version (CD Rom),"The Oxford Spanish Dictionary on CD-ROM: Windows Version (CD Rom)This product version is not ""Vista"" compatable. Ordered/requested the above product in the 3rd edition which is ""Vista"" compatable without success. Amazon does not carry the 3rd edition."
1,poor search engine,"took a paper dictionary and converted it directlly to digital. poor seach engin.couldn't use for verb tenses, a franklin electronic dictionary has more use. Taking a rosetta stone course and half the words I would look up the dictionary would not find, or not defined in a simalar manner. Used my wifes five year old franklin and it understood the rosetta stone words . Returned it hope I get money back"
4,Good alternative to surge protected power strips,"I normally use power strips (6 surge protected outlets) throughout the house. They are good on protecting powered devices and appliances. The negatives on them for me are the extra wire clutters and the continuous low power consumed (few watts).So when I have couple of situations that 1) do not really need surge protection, and 2) location not good to ""dangle"" a power strip, I bought couple of these as alternatives. They are really convenient to use, but outlets are tight where plugging in an AC (wall) adapter on the bottom will lose 1 other outlet, connecting to the top row and will lose two other outlets (one adjacent, and one below.All in all, it's best used in certain situations and definitely worth the little price!"
5,Good product,Great product. Bought a couple of them. Only complaint is that the plug ins are a little too close to each other. You can fit something like two iphone chargers side by side but nothing bigger than that. If you have an odd shaped plug in it will most likely cover up several slots. Works very well. Overall satisfied.
4,Does it's job,This is much nicer than others because it screws into the outlet so when you unplug a cord that is a really tight fit you don't need to worry about the entire adapter coming out unplugging everything. The fit on this isn't perfect and the plastic has a cheap look and feel to it but for the money this is a great product.
4,DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN!!!!,"Ok, this product arrived within 2 days... Thank you, Amazon Prime. I went to 'install' it and when I was tightening the screw, I snapped the internal screw 'catch.' I am not sure what to call the 'catch.' Typically, when you are tightening a screw, you feel more tension as you are close to the fully tightening point of that screw, but on this product, you will not. Therefore, I warn, be careful. That being said, the product still works after I broke the screw 'catch.' So I give it 4 stars."
3,Really a 4-outlet adapter,"This works fine, but sometimes prongs need coaxing to fit. Only 4 of the outlets are actually usable, even with the smallest plugs, because they are spaced too close to one another."
4,Nice,"Easy and fast to install. Replaces the faceplate, and you'll need a philips head screwdriver to install.Bought two for a room that I use a lot of electical devices in. Works well so far. You're going to need to press the plugs in firmly, as the fit is a bit tight, but I have no prongs exposed. Even works pretty good with one of my surge protectors plugged into it.Might get a couple more if I need more outlets in other rooms."
4,It is what it is.,"This thing is a great addition to my apartment, which has only two outlets in the living room. I have two of these: One behind the couch (for when friends want to use their laptops/charge their phones) and one behind the armoire (for the TV, Wii, DVD player, and record player). My only complaint is that sometimes the plug doesn't go in all the way. It does with go in if I push hard enough, but I have this irrational fear of getting shocked, so I usually don't. At least it still does its job when the plug is partially in the socket."
2,Poor quality,"This is a flimsy product. There are better ones available, so don't buy this one. I bought two of these. On the first one, the plastic hole that the mounting screw goes through broke as I tightened the screw with a cordless screwdriver. I then installed the second one, carefully tightening the screw by hand so I wouldn't break it. Even with the mounting screw snugly tightened, the adapter rocks from side to side. I bought a similar adapter from my local hardware store for the same price that doesn't rock (sorry, I don't remember the brand of that one.) Two stars only because it's inexpensive, but sometimes you get what you pay for."
5,These weren't as easy to install as I might have thought...........,..........but I installed them anyway and was very glad I did. I no longer have to use power strips for what I use them for.
5,Great,Great purchase. It does its job and I couldn't be happier. It arrived on time and was packaged very nicely.
4,Really good!,"The only thing i didn't like about this product is that big cables and plugs, take two outlets sometimes, but besides that, it has help me a lot! great product."
5,PERFECT,I wasn't looking for something with surge protection (you don't need it for everything) but I had a couple of outlets that there was just not enough plugs available. I bought one to try it out and it worked so good that 3 days later I bought another one. I am about to buy a third one for another spot in the house and I may just buy a few extra just in case. One can't have enough plugs as long as you don't have 6 things plug into all of them and running at the same time your home's circuit breakers should be protection enough for basic use.
5,"A ""solid"" good buy!","This ladder is great... locks into place, wide steps, place for paint and tools, grab bar on top for stability. Folds easily for storage."
4,Hard To Beat - UPDATED after 18 months,"What can you say, it is sturdy, I love the area for paint or other things you might need (like your light bulbs) while working. Not as easy to unfold ( you got to use 2 hands) but that kinda comes with being more sturdy. Highly recommend, only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that mine came with a small spring loaded part part dropped out. Took me like 2 minutes to replace and can't figure out how it ever came out but just being honest. I like it or I would have returned it :) UPDATE: 18 months later and I used it all summer long for dozens of projects and it was great, I especially like feeling secure when you are up on it and not ""wobbly"" like others I owned previously. Still highly recommend."
1,Weak,Packageing was poor and the ladder was damaged in shippingAmazon took back no problem. Excellent service
5,ladder,product is very large and quite heavy--it is very well made and will support anything--i would buy again
4,Great find,"I purchased one myself, when it arrived, i loved it! The wide steps give a more stable footing when you are using it.Easy to set up and fold.I loved it so much that I bought one for my father-in-law."
3,Second one was better,"Our platform step ladder came to us quickly, but was damaged when we got it.The box it came in was damaged. The legs of the ladder were sticking out of the bottom or the box. Delivery person left it by our door that way. We had to jump through a few hoops to get another one, which took a lot longer time to get than the first one. The second ladder works very well, and is very useful for what we need it for."
5,Comic book writers can be good novel writers,"In the tradition of those comic book writers who can make a successful jump to novel writing (They include Peter David and David Michelinie) Danny Fingeroth and Eric Fein made such a move in this, the first book of the ""Doom's Day"" trilogy. The story is very balanced out. With half the action centering on Peter Parker and the other half on Dr. Bruce Banner. Flash Thomson and the Black Cat played important roles in the story and we get to see the new head of a goverment agency make his debut here in the form of Col. Sean Morgan and his team at SAFE. Danny and Eric woked as both writers and editors of Spider-Man for a good many years at Marvel and here they get a change to work with him one more time. It was a delightful story."
4,A Visual Scandinavian Banquet for the Senses!,"I've long admired Arcadia's ""Images of America"" series. Despite that the entire book is printed in black and white and there are no color photos, this 128-page coffee table book is a must-have for anyone interested in the history and ephemera associated with Swedish immigration to Chicago at the beginning of the 20th century.Peterson's photographs and images are stunningly crisp and his prose sings as he introduces the chapter openers and informs the reader with the detailed photo captions.The book is not cumulative in the history it presents, but with 128 pages, you get more than your money's worth in this ethnic gem."
4,Robert Redford in an early appearance as a cowboy.,"Robert Redford put in an extremely early appearance in this fine episode of ""Maverick"" featuring Jack Kelly as the title character's brother Bart. This one's a very good straight western involving a cattle drive and a character whose hand was amputated by Indians and casually uses an iron prosthetic to crush the skull of an argumentative associate. Redford has an oddly baby-faced look here, with ample cheeks and a hint of his famously acne-scarred complexion visible. Fast paced and well acted, this is an excellent example of a 50s TV western and an intriguing curio for Redford admirers."
1,Buyer Beware,Unfortunately I let this cd sit on my shelf for several months before opening it to play at work. The CD was missing. Too late to return. Check out your purchases before the deadline.
3,"Interesting idea, not much of good choice of scenes.","I must admit that I'm quite fascinated by slow-mo and things that we can see once we crank the speed down. It gives you quite a different (and interesting!) insight into how the world around us operates.This series has a massive educational potential and to certain degree, it manages to reach the expectations. A few episodes will leave you amazed when you see what actually happens with objects that explode, crash etc.Unfortunately, I think that authors didn't quite managed to deliver the excitement expected. Some of episodes are rather dull and offer nothing but mindless, short fun that will be forgotten once you're done watching it.Still, I do recommend getting this BR as price is quite fair and you will enjoy some of episodes. For me, although I knew a lot of these things, it was still fun and educational to see it in slow-mo."
3,Interesting from a history of film/sci fi perspective,"1930, France. This French speaking film is the grandfather of all disasterfilms. It also showes a mixing of silent film and 'talkie' acting and directing. If you can get into the 'why they did it this way' of the script and direction you might enjoy it, otherwise its just a footnote in film history."
2,very basic,Some of the sauces are laughable. definitely for a beginner. Can get better stuff off the web. Its not that complete and should give a better understanding of the mother sauces. Good for a reference to kick up ideas to ad lib your own.
4,Great for cooking beginners,"Every sauce we've tried from this book is good- some are mediocre (not really worth the effort), but still good."
1,No Inspirations,"I ordered this book because I needed some good sauce recipes. I like pictures. Pictures help me create the dish and also lets me know what it is supposed to look like. This book has NO PICTURES!!! The recipes are some Ive never heard before. I need simple everyday sauces, like chutneys,gravys,dips. I could not find these recipes in this book. This is not a beginner sauce book."
3,Not bad...,"This book was given to my husband for Christmas. It's ok... Not a lot of help for basic sauces, more for gourmet sauces."
4,Bar BQ Judge & Cook,"As a barbecue judge and cook a sauce is essential to enhancing a cooked item. Knowing the foundation of how to develop and link a quality sauce to a meat is essential. This book provides the fundamentals needed to create a quality sauce with flavor without investing a lot of money in books, CD's and DVD's."
