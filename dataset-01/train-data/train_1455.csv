1,"I wanted to love it, however...","What can I say about an appliance that broke after ONE use? I just purchased this a few months ago here on Amazon and it has been sitting, perfectly fine, since then. A few days ago I finally used it to make hard boiled eggs. It was easy, quick and the eggs turned out perfectly. I couldn't wait to use it again. The second time I tried to use it, the timer bell kept ringing constantly, and there is no heat on either setting. I now have the privilege of paying to send it in to an out-of-state Krups service center, am out the machine, and now have 7 (uncooked) eggs with holes in them sitting back in my fridge. So, I guess I do know what to say. Bummer."
2,Product did not perform....,"I was so hyped when I ordered this egg cooker...it was the right size, the right price, perfect for what I needed. I ordered it, but when I received my cooker, the water measurer was broken, so I had to replace it. Amazon shipped my replacement right away, but the timing bell on the second cooker did not work. Amazon wouldn't go for a third replacement so I guess I'll have to try another brand. Too bad these units aren't holding up to the Krups name."
4,Krups Egg Cooker review,"After receiving an egg cooker that stopped working after about a week, I sent it back and received a new one. It has been working just fine to this point.I am especially impressed by the customer service at Amazon. When we contacted them about the problem, there were no hassles or delays, we were sent a new egg cooker right away. Great job!"
2,Unhappy Krups customer,"I was very unhappy Christmas morning when my wife opened this gift. She was all set for her favorite soft boiled eggs and was surprised with a broken water measure inside a perfectly good condition box. This measure was wrapped in plastic so it is my belief it was broken during packaging at the factory. What happened to good old quality control. Without the proper amount of water the Egg Cooker was useless, the amount of water controls the hardness of the cooked egg. Maybe buying this product at a local store and inspecting before purchasing would have helped to make this gift a success."
3,not as good as I had hoped it would be,"My electric egg cooker went to heck after 20 some years. I needed a replacement.Sunbeam's are no longer made so I thought I would try Krups.Krups is a well known name.The egg cooker did not shut off automatically!. The timer was a weird buzz.Also you can only poach 2 eggs at a time, one in each cup.I returned the item and bought a West Bend ."
4,egg maker,"I was skeptical about buying this product, but I had read a lot of good reviews. They were all right. An egg cooked in this machine taste so much better than boiled, I recommend it anyone."
5,"Works, Rules, BUY IT!","There are only two things you need to remember when using this egg cooker.1. Don't forget to pierce the egg2. Put the water in first before putting the eggs in, if you dont the eggs will break while cooking.This Egg Express is amazing, it does what it says, and the eggs taste better than any egg I've had before. The buzzer works and is loud like a washing machine buzzer. Good buy!"
4,Great For Hard Boiled Eggs,I bought this mainly to poach eggs with but find itvery useful for making boiled eggs for deviled eggs.It is hard to tell when the poached eggs are done soam not really too pleased at the poaching part.That is probably a problem on my part and notthe egg cooker.For the boiled eggs there is a little measuringcup with a egg piercer on the end to pierce theegg with. This makes it easier to peel.I like it so much I bought 2 more for Christmas giftsfor my children.I would recommend this item.
3,Egg Cooker,We Love Egg cookers. Our last one broke. This one isn't as sturdy built as the other and doesn't appear to be able to last as long as our last one. We will probably try a different brand the next time.
2,Great for hard boiled; not so much for poached,"I bought this appliance primarily because I love poached eggs and wanted a quick and easy way to make them that didn't require me to wait for a pan full of water to boil. Sadly, while this thing boils eggs like a champ, the poached eggs leave much to be desired. Despite following the instructions exactly, every time the yolks cook perfectly, but most of the whites stay stuck to the dish (and i do spray liberally with olive oil cooking spray prior to cooking). I even tried adding a little water to the cups themselves, with no luck. I am really disappointed."
1,Garbage,Absolute trash. A waste of time and money. I just went through an entire dozen eggs trying to get hard boiled eggs for the week. Put in the correct amount of water for hard boiled eggs; turned the thing on; and watched as the egg whites came up out of the hole in the top of the eggs. I will never buy anything that is made with the KRUPS name again.
2,Auto shut off,"My West Bend finally quit working after 20 years so I gave the Krups a shot. First time I used it, I loaded and turned it on. I got called away and returned an hour later. It was still on and buzzing! No auto shut off. Burned eggs. Bad design not having auto shut off."
3,Durability Issues,"What seems to be a common issue with this item is that the buzzer dies. Today I pulled it out, added just enough water for two soft boiled eggs. While it was doing it's magic, I was right next to it straightening the kitchen. 30 Minutes later I began to wonder how much longer, the water was gone, no buzzer and no surprise the eggs were hard boiled by having been left in their steam. If I need to set a timer for this, I might as well bring water to a boil on my induction stove, it seems more accurate. It did a great job for a while, but it's pretty pricey for not being reliable I feel. However if you feel like you must by an egg cooker, stay clear of Cuisinart CEC-7 Egg Cooker, we had this model before and it started to leak terribly every where over the counter every single time we used it. You will like this one here better for as long as it ends up lasting you."
2,Hard boiled doesn't mean Hard Boiled!,I ordered this product just before Easter to allow my son to do the eggs all by himself. He likes hard boiled eggs year round so this seemed like the perfect solution. Little did I know that even following the directions exactly didn't produce hard boiled eggs. The yellow centers were never done the first cycle and I always lose at least one egg every cycle because it bursts even though we put the hole in it. I'm sending it back after less than one week of trying to make it work.
2,NOT a time saver,"I bought this after searching 220v electronics. After it arrived I realized 230 was just part of the product number. The first time I used it, 30 minutes went by without completion. I thought I set it up wrong. I'm using it now to soft boil 4 eggs. Its been at least 15 minutes. I gave away my other, cheaper egg cooker when this arrived. Boy do I miss it. My old one could cook 7 eggs in 10 minutes. This is supposed to be a convenience item, instead it sucks electricity and takes 3x longer than it should. DON'T BUY!"
3,egg cooker,using this egg cooker makes it easier cooking eggs. most of the time the eggs come out just about right.
5,Egg Cooker,I bought this Krups 230-70 because I never could get my eggs poached the way I liked them. Good product and very happy with it. Would definitely recommend it.
3,"Not bad, but..","I have already used twice. It saves me time and I like that. The noise signal that the eggs are already is strong, so good! But it leaves the egg in the puncture. The water exits through the lid."
2,Worked great until alarm stopped working,I've only used this probably 10-15 times and the alarm has stopped working. The concept is great and the hard boiled eggs come out great and easy to peel. Trying a different brand.
4,Like my eggs!,"Just received this product and love it----haven't done hard boiled yet, but soft and medium eggs are great and it's quick and eggs are perfect! It's all about adjusting the amount of water needed for the egg type you like!"
2,dissatisfied customer,"Was very disappointed in the Krups egg cooker. You can only cook two poached eggs at at time and then you have to wait for at least 20 to 30 minutes for the cooker to cool down before putting two more egss in. The timer will not reset itself until the cooker is completely cool. When hard boiling eggs, what was once on the inside is all over the outside of the egg.Would not recommend this product for anyone."
4,Like it lots,works well. My husband loves it. Quick shipping. My husband eats boiled eggs everyday and he says that the eggs are easy to peel.
2,Garage Sale Bound,"When I boiled eggs in a pot, one or two would crack, leak and make a mess of my pan and I'd have to throw the leaking eggs away. So I would typically boil one or two extra as ""sacrificial"".After reading the reviews on this product, I ordered it, believing those days of sacrificial eggs were over. After a month and a dozen and a half eggs later, and following the directions to the letter, I still end up with 1-2 eggs leaking like a lava pit and have to clean the plastic holder and the cooking container of burnt on egg whites. This morning was the last straw, out of three eggs, two hemorrhaged, the whites again making a mess.So its back to the pan."
3,It did ok,"I've only used it once, but the eggs were not cooked perfectly. I will have to play with adjusting the water level. However, the eggs were cooked, the finsihed bell was loud enough to hear in the another room. It's nice and compact - really is quite small. Overall, worth a try for the money."
5,Great poached eggs!,I had given up on automatic egg machines until I got my Krupps. I like soft poached eggs. The Krupps makes them perfectly with no fuss and little cleanup. I am extremely happy with my purchase.
5,"Yes, Yes, Yes!","I have learned to allow the hard boiled eggs to sit, rather than cool under water to insure the doneness of the eggs........The Krubs Express Egg Cooker is very well made, makes a nice appearance, and does the job it is intended to do. I have not tried making soft boiled eggs yet. I have had two other makes of egg cookers and like the Krubs the best. I think it would be a great idea to tell customers to let the eggs cool without the (benefit) of the cool water after cooking........thanks for this opportunity Chris"
4,Excellent Product,I love this product. I've had this product now for two months and haven't experienced a single problem. I also haven't had a broken hard boiled egg since I bought this. It makes excellent poached eggs. I have never eaten as many eggs as I have since I bought this egg cooker.
4,egg cooking,"this machine works as advertised , eggs come out perfect every time easy to clean . the only reason I do not give it a 5 is because the container you use to fill with water is hard to read , otherwise it is is outstandingI have had this a while longer, and find it does not work as well with time. The eggs break open and the water is now overflowing out the vent."
3,"Cooks well; Timer doesn't work, could use Auto-shutoff","Have used my new Krups egg cooker three times now; it is doing the cooking job, four eggs are turning-out hard-boiled after exactly 15 min. And the design is cute.I know how long it's taking, because the Timer on the cooker isn't working, no beeping or flashing or anything. After 15 min, the water for 4 eggs hard-boiled has boiled away completely; I suppose the design intended for it to sense a lack of water on the hotplate to triger the alarm, but it's not happening.The main thing is the eggs are turning out cooked as expected; and, this cooker isn't leaking water all over the countertop like my last stainless-steel Chefs Choice egg cooker did. I just need to be sure and use my nearby kitchen timer to alert me when the time is up. Rating it three stars for not living-up to it's described functionality."
5,Worth 6 Stars,"I would give this item 6 stars if I could. After 3 rounds of a full 7 egg load, it has worked flawlessly, and had made perfectly cooked eggs that peel with ease. I thought about taking a picture of the shells I just peeled, because all of the eggs left almost half the shell intact, which I just peeled off in big pieces with no sticking."
5,Fast and easy,"I've had other egg cookers, but this one is the best. Easy to use, accurate results, and eggs that peel easily."
1,"This little cooker really started out great, but...","...about 4 months after I bought it, the bell stopped ringing (the loud bell was the main reason we picked this model). I called the manufacturer and asked them to honor the warranty . They said they have no servicer in my area, but I could pack and send it at my own expense to an appliance service in Wichita, Kansas,who will fix or replace it. They recommended I use UPS. Per the UPS website, it'll cost over $6 to send even if I pack it myself. Bottom line: 1)cooked great eggs for 4 months; 2)broke; 3)so much money and inconvenience to get it serviced that I'll probably just buy another one (but not this brand)."
4,Great value for the money spent,"I like:Product is handy, wire wraps around the base which is an excellent feature.Buzzer is loud enough. I can hear it from other room.I dislike:If some water is left in the black heating pan after egg is cooked then it sticks to the surface making it very difficult to cleanOverall: I liked this product for the money I spent on it. Worth buying."
3,It works,"It cooks eggs as advertised. However, it does not automatically turn itself off, so forget about hopping in the shower while it's running. Also, it does not appear to be dishwasher safe. The instructions provide information on hand washing. The bottom of the egg holder is kind of like a honeycomb, so it's difficult to wash by hand."
5,Perfect Poached Eggs,Purchased this compact unit specifically for the poached eggs feature. The eggs came out perfect although you can only make two at a time. The oblong shape presented itself much better on a fresh crousant instead of on the traditional English muffin. I am pleasantly pleased.
1,Cheap Trash,I used this egg poacher 3 times before it broke it s a cheap piece of crap...Well its not even that cheap as far as egg poachers go so its just crap and not cheap crap.
2,Not so great,I purchased this because of the brand(Krups)but it turned out to be one of those not so great items. Cooked the eggs OK but just not good enough to keep. Too many other egg cookers for the same or less money which are probably better.
2,Gives a plastic taste to poached eggs,"I received the Krups egg cooker for Christmas and was pleased with how it worked for soft and hard boiled eggs. It's easy to use and the timing is correct for each style of eggs. When I used the egg poacher however, I found that unless you use an extra large egg, the poacher container is only half full and produces a flat poached egg. It also imparts a distinctly plastic flavor to the egg even after I washed the plastic inserts by hand and in the dishwasher. I pitched it and bought the Chef's Choice egg cooker which is only about $10 more and doesn't have these problems."
3,Undercooked eggs,"I have used this egg cooker for almost a year. When trying to make hard boiled eggsj, if I cook 6 eggs with the amount of water the measuring device says to use, the eggs are very undercooked. If I use more water, they seem to get done. With their measurements, the more eggs you cook, the less water you use! Why am I having such a hard time making them come out right????"
5,rockin' eggs,"Since I am a single guy who only ""cooks"" with a microwave I thought I would give this a shot. I LOVE IT! This puppy makes the perfect hard boiled eggs every time, and it could not be easier. Put in water w/the measuring device provided, put in eggs, put on lid, turn knob on and go watch TV. Soon the timer goes off and after running the eggs under cold water for a few minutes voila'! I only have 2 other things to say about this item. 1)I have found that when using the ""shell prick"" that is on the end of the measurer the eggs tend to explode and can get over done. I have not used this since the first time and have gotten intact perfectly done eggs every time. 2)The tray holds seven eggs? Why not six? Doesn't matter. I LOVE it!"
1,Krups Egg Cooker poorly designed,"Krups 230-70 Egg Express Egg Cookerbad design. the included water measurer is very hard to read and difficult to get the right measure. Eggs sometimes crack open and contents spread about. The alarm indicating that cooking is done is too loud and harsh, offensive actually. When one load of eggs has been cooked, it is necessary to wait another 30 minutes before the appliance has cooled enough to be used again - if you try too soon you get that loud, harsh alarm. I had a Sunbeam egg cooker many years ago and hoped for the same kind of quality. Very disappointed."
5,Krups 230-70 Egg Express Egg Cooker,This is the second such egg cooker that we have had. The first one lasted around five years after being used one to two times daily. The plastic parts started breaking and weren't available for replacement so we bought a new one.We like this egg cooker because it is easy to use and makes eggs perfectly. It is small so it doesn't take up much room on a kitchen counter either.
5,The Best Way to Cook EGGS!! Must Have!,"We just purchased this egg cooker, I was not so sure about it as I like my eggs cooked well but my husband really wanted it, he just made us some poached eggs and I have to say they were wonderful!! It's great to eat eggs without them being burned or cooked with oil or butter! They taste fantastic. This cooker is super easy to use and really no clean up! I recommend it for sure!!"
5,A Great Eggmaker,"I purchased this item based primarily on previous reviews. It certainlyis an excellent product at an attractive price through Amazon.com. The first time I made poached eggs, the timer went off way too early--I don't know why; however, the next time (and every time since then) the eggs were perfect. Hard boiled eggs were just right from the very first time I made them. Instructions and operation of the unit are simple and should be read thoroughly prior to use. Clean-up is easy, too. You'll also like the way the power cord stores in the unit's base. If you enjoy poached and/or hard boiled eggs, this is the cooker to buy!"
4,A nifty 3-task device,"This gadget really is a bargain at $20. FYI from previous review(s), the manual is INCORRECT showing the (POINTED) end of the egg being punctured (illustration #2) DO PUNCTURE THE ROUND END and you could prevent a mess. Every function worked as described. Owners should probably convert the measuring beaker capacities into fluid ounces or mL using a measuring cup should it become lost or broken. If it had an automatic shut-off feature I would have rated it 5 stars. Remember to allow yourself adequate time for cooking, this is a product that should NOT be left unattended while using. Enjoy ""egg-heads"" !"
5,Great for the Holidays!,"I've had this egg cooker for a few years but after getting it out again for the holidays, I just had to write a review.First, it makes perfect eggs. You know the perfect Martha Stewart looking ones with no green rings. That alone is fantastic when you're making eggs for company. Secondly, it frees up a pan and a burner and we all know that is priceless during the holidays. Just made all my eggs for dressing and deviled eggs in just minutes. No guess work, really no work at all. The cooker comes with a plastic cylinder that has a needle on the end of it. Just poke your eggs so the steam can escape. The cylinder itself is a measuring device for the amount of water to add. You just fill to line based on how many eggs and how done you want them. Turn the cooker on and it beeps when the eggs are done. And now your done! How simply is that!"
5,Krups Egg Cooker,"this is our 5. egg cooker. Had all kinds of products before.In germany, where we are orignal came from, we had an egg cookeralso. When we discoverd this cooker here on line, we placed ourorder right away!Having and using this cooker now for 3 weeks, like in germanywe are really happy to have it.Would purchases an other Krups egg cooker, after this properlywill breake of old age in view years.Lilo, Florida"
3,Probably worthwhile to find a better product.,"While I do like the idea of an egg cooker, and enjoy the benefits of this machine, I think I could have made a better purchase. There are a few annoying traits about this machine.- the alarm is really annoying and doesn't shut off until you go turn it off. I prefer a few beeps as a signal, not a loud continuous buzz.- the eggs don't cook correctly until you let them come to room temperature. If you use eggs straight from the fridge, you will have to guess on the cook time. (more water = longer cook time). This was particularly problematic for poaching eggs.- the egg-poking needle on the water-measuring tube is useless. My egg dislodged the needle from its mounting, because it is so weakly attached. However, you -need- the needle to stay in place, because if it's removed, you now have a hole in the bottom of the water-measuring tube."
3,Flawed finished alarm,"This egg cooker does a great job of cooking eggs. That said, it does have 2 serious flaws. 1. The 'finished' cooking alarm is no more than a 'click' which, unless you are standing right next to it, you can't hear it. 2. The cooker itself does not shut off. The heat remains on,as they mention, to keep the eggs warm. If you aren't there to shut it off manually, your eggs can continue to cook even on the warm setting.I would not buy this item again."
1,The pot method still works better and cheaper,"This is a decent egg cooker... I guess. It only loused up the eggs a couple of times. Unfortunately, it lasted just over a year... just like the one before it.The switch is a little confusing. I'm neither used to nor like the European nomenclature with pictographs. How about ""ON - OFF - WARM?"" That works! I wish as much for the cooker. I'm going back to the pot."
2,works ok until you have had it awhile,It worked ok the first couple weeks but then began leaking water so that when the annoying buzzer went off my eggs weren't hard boiled and the appliance was sitting in a pool of water which can't be good. I would try another brand. I just ordered an Oster I am going to try next. Wouldn't buy this one again.
4,Husband friendly!,"My husband hates kitchen gadgets. But, he loves hard boiled eggs.This gadget is one which he actually uses and likes!I highly recommend this if you have a gadget-phobic person in your house.This is simple to use and the promotional information on amazon.com is factual. Just remember to find the ""air-pocket"" end of the egg when piercing. Otherwise, you cooked eggs will appear quite comical!"
5,Makes great poached eggs!,"We originally bought this egg cooker 7+ years ago and used it about twice/week making poached eggs. We wore the poached egg trays out, so we decided to replace the entire unit because it was showing its age. We found the replacement on Amazon and it works just as well as our original. Over the years we've tried a couple of other appliances for poached eggs, and this one is the easiest to use and does a great job!"
4,like it so far,"I have been using this for over a month, except for one thing that it does not have a auto switch off when eggs are cooked/boiled, I have no other complaints."
5,This is so practical,"My wife has an older model, a little wornout. She has been so happy with this replacement. It's an easy way to make soft and hard boiled eggs. Clean up is a quick rinse thanks to the coating. Cord storage is a nice feature. This is a great kitchen appliance!"
4,Works great for me!,"I brought this egg cooker into work to cut down on my breakfast costs. It works wonderfully, cooks all my eggs to a perfect hard boil. I haven't tried any other settings. A couple notes - the gunk it leaves on the cooking element is pretty gross. Also, the buzzer is more annoying than it needs to be - I have to run to it from my desk before my coworkers kick me as the buzzer just goes and goes until you flip the switch to off. I would have preferred a 'ding' or nice bell. But for $20, I can't complain too much. Worth the money!"
2,hard to clean,For poached eggs this is not the machine. The cups are impossible to clean. Following the instructions the poached eggs are certainly not soft. Not one of my better investments.
1,rubbish,this product dosen't come up to scratch in fact it is very poor I followed the intructions to the letter with poor results!
1,"no bell, no timer, no automatic shut off!","I should have read the reviews before I bought this one trick pony? It only makes hard boiled eggs because there is no bell to tell you it is done, no automatic shut off. I guess if you didn't watch it, it would just burn up! I have had other egg cookers that are a better buy and they actually cook the eggs the way you want. To bad Krups does not read these review. To bad Amazon does not read these reviews and put the ad, but I guess greed comes in all shapes."
1,Doesn't really do a good job...,"I love poached eggs and I was hoping this would make the whole process a little easier. Unfortunatly, this unit does not make good poached eggs. I have not tried any of the other functions..."
1,Don't Buy!!!,"I received the Krups egg cooker as gift, when opened the measuring cup as well as the plastic handle was broken. Decided to try unit as damaged items appeared to not affect it's function. Followed enclosed directions and ended up with a great hard boiled egg, but also a large puddle of water surrounding unit. Also you cannot use it again until unit has cooled completely, around 45 minutes. I called Krups customer service center and was told to return the cooker to them at MY expense and they would repair or replace. The closest warranty center is 200 miles away so I will just forgo using it and any other Krups product in the future!"
1,Poor instructions,"I just got this otherday and decided to try it out, i followed the instructions. but its instructions say ""Remove the lid(c) and run the egg holder (b) under cold water (5)"" no where in that section does it say steam may burn hands when removing lid so use caution. I took the lid off as directions and the steam burned my hand. Atleast when i open a microwave popcorn bag it warns me of steam, this did no such thing. And i did not know that it could possibly hold up steam. i had made sure the steam hole in lid was clear of obstruction as safety guidline stated.i will promptly be returning this item to the place i bought it"
4,egg express pros and cons,"I am very satisified with the egg cooker. Especially the poached eggs. They are delicious, but I wish the poacher was larger to hold two eggs in each container. We tried it that was, and when is was finished cooking, we had to put the eggs in a skillet to finish cooking. We haven't used the hard or soft boiled eggs part yet but have heard from other users that they are also very good."
5,This is the best egg cooker...,"I had my previous Krups egg cooker at least 5 years. With 3 little ones and husband, this is used every day. Yes, I do know how to cook, but you put the egg in, with the measured water, and you can walk away. The alarm tells you when it is ready. Even my 8 year old uses it over pre-packaged breakfast microwave food. The egg poacher cooks the eggs perfect everytime. Hard boiled eggs are a snap. My kids always request hard boiled eggs for lunches. The perfect food with the perfect cooker. When my first Krups finally gave in from so much use, I thought I would upgrade. I purchased and used the Oster egg cooker. What a mistake. The eggs would cook uneven and was next to impossible to get the eggs out, even with a heavy dose of pam. My kids gave the Oster machine a big ""no"". I am now, happily, here to order my Krups egg express. For the money and the time saver, this is your machine!"
5,Super!,"Super product for an egg lover like me. Makes the perfect soft,medium,hard eggs in minutes. It makes me delicious, perfect eggs every morning. Great utility."
4,Krups Egg Cooker,"Hard boiled eggs come out perfect. I would like to have known that this egg cooker did not turn off automatically. However, the buzzer is loud enough to let you know when the eggs are done."
3,"Cooks a decent egg, but then",it starts BUZZING once it's done. Other reviewers mention a 'beep' that can go unnoticed. I think Krups overcompensated big time.
4,Works as advertised.,"Works pretty well. Much easier than using the boiling water, faster too. Only complaint is the lack of ""Cook"" and ""Keep Hot"" labels, instead they have two icons, which I guess we are suppose to memorize. I use it once in a while and always get confused which side to set it to. Why not put labels with the icons? I had to put the labels using a permanent marker to prevent from having to refer to instructions before each use. Purchased in Jan 2005, still working well."
4,Love it!,"I have had this egg cooker for 7 years! I love it. I have given it as a gift to many. It is compact, so it fits nicely on a shelf. Easy to keep clean. It makes eggs perfect every time!highly recommended."
3,"Works, but...",I bought it for poaching... and it's good for cooking 1 or 2 eggs. Not terribly useful if you want to poach more eggs. Apparently need to let it idle between sets of eggs for 20 minutes or the cooking logic/process doesn't work right.
1,Huge build-up to a lot of nothing,"Talk about a huge disappointment. After the firefight at the Guggenheim and the whole lecture on working outside the system and collateral damage, one would expect a big ending. Nope. Big nothing.But since it was BluRay, it was a high-quality disappointment."
2,Disappointing final product,"This movie just doesn't deliver on its potential. Chemistry and characterizations are lacking. Background of characters is missing to make you care about these people. Naomi Watts, normally one of my favorite actors, was wooden and one-dimensional. The whole storyline was rather commonplace and uninspiring."
4,Nice Adult Financial Thriller,"I saw this one in the theatre and liked it enough to purchase on dvd. You pretty much have to be a fan of the genre to like it. The locations are great throughout the movie. The acting is decent. It can get a bit confusing at times. The shootout is great. Overall, a better than average movie of it's type."
3,Fair thriller,"'The International' refers to a commercial bank - one specializing in gray- and black-market transactions, with a portfolio of customers that ensure they're too big to fail. This plot gets under way when it turns out that the bank also brokers arms deals, among other things, and connects non-governmental missile buyers with after-market guidance system upgrades.We've been through the recent financial hooha, so it's hardly surprising that the bank's goals are a bit subtler than they would have been five years ago, but all the more believable for that reason. Clive Owen and Naomi Watts put in good performances as the good guys. Still, although this movie is easy to enjoy, it never rose above commodity entertainment. I might see it again, but wouldn't go out of my way.-- wiredweird"
2,Half a bag of popcorn,The gunfight in the Guggenheim Museum is the whatever of the movie and it was childish. To break down the movie it's a nasty German enabling the destruction of those forever victims Israelis.Maybe I'm jaded but I wouldn't be writing this but the movie was a boring stinko and am disappointed.
5,Excellent HD 1080 p ...blu-ray only!!!!,As the title says the quality of the movie in blu-ray is excellent. The movie itself is also good so if you want to buy this movie choose it in blu-ray
4,Solid!,"A fantastic gun battle, very good acting and a plot that probably happens everyday in real life makes this film a must see. I truly enjoyed it."
3,the profit to be made in 3rd world blood,"The hero is out to stopping the (International) IBBC bank's killing ways.What really happens is that he finds one hit man and leads a Italian revenge hit manto his marks, but the of weapons deals business goes on as usualwith record profits.As long a greed fuels international fortunes that are madeselling drugs, killing machines or anything else illegal but profitable,the banks will finance it or launder the money.This movie is sort of Scotland yard goes roguewhen a former British detective joins Interpol to run down the peoplew\ho killed his witness and family.The movie is action packed, but gives a message that fightingthe big business of crime is useless ( so why should you try?)."
3,A Timely Thriller,"Conspiracy theorists will enjoy the ""The International"". Considering the recent banking debacle, this is a timely thriller. A definite ""guy flick"". Blood, violence, lots of ""shoot em up"".The complicated plot is sometimes hard to follow. Good photography, fast paced. Decent acting and directing."
5,it may not be a true story but it represents a true one,"this may not be a true story but the reality is, thats how the actual world runs. i think the imprtant thing about such a movei is that it enlightens us to to a more deeper shadow world where politics, blood, intrests of superpowers all overlap. just to give you an insight of what i am saying , i suggest you read the following titlesThe Game of Nations: The Amorality of Power PoliticsConfessions of an Economic Hitman"
3,"Nice Photography, Confusing Plot","The International begins on a good premise - there is corruption in the banking world and the good guys want to put a stop to it. From there, the plot gets confusing. It travels all over the world and different agencies (Interpol, NYPD, U.S. Dep't. of Justice, etc.) all get involved. In addition, there is corruption around every corner. I tend to love conspiracy movies, but this one is just too confusing.Clive Owens does a good job as a tormented, harried, and near broken-down Interpol agent. Naomi Watts' character is somewhat wooden as an attorney from the U.S. Department of Justice.The movie is worth seeing for the shoot-out scene in the Guggenheim Museum in New York and that is why I rented it. I didn't have high expectations but I was entertained as I thought I'd be. Many parts of the plot were unclear or not fleshed out. If that is acceptable, you'll probably find it entertaining as I did. Just don't expect it to be more than that."
4,Good film about something noone wants to talk about,"This film was very well done: Good Story, Good acting, Good directing and camera work. It highlights one of the things in our society that noone wants to accept: government is not a big brother that will take care of you, but an institution. The system not only can be bought, but has been for a long time now. And, this is a very well done film about just how that works.Everyone thinks that the US Constitution is about giving citizens rights, but that is not what it says and not the purpose of it. It is an attempt to limit the power of government so that it doesn't get the power to reign over us the way governments in the rest of the world do. But people today have forgotten the simple fact that any organization that is big enough to take care of all your needs is big enough to take all your rights away."
2,"Dull and lifeless, but original","I really wanted to like this film, I really did. However, there's really no saving grace for this film besides Clive Owen's acting, great cinematography, an original plot, and an outstanding shootout sequence. I have never seen a film so devoid of life. There is no humor, barely any action, and the dialogue is overly complex, bland, and lifeless. I wasn't expecting a shoot-em-up thriller like Taken or even the 007 films, but I was expecting a smart yet entertaining thriller. 'The International' does manage to be smart, but TOO smart, to the point where it is just not an enjoyable film. However, if you enjoy a very intelligent political thriller with much of the plot advancing through dialogue, then 'The International' may be your type of movie.On a side note, the picture and audio quality is great. Not the best, but very impressive."
2,International House of Flopcakes,"Wanted to like this.Had one highlight - the shootout at the Guggenheim Museum.Inconclusive ending. I hate that, after sitting through almost 2 hours of it.Naomi Watts looked better with shorter hair in Peter Jackson's KING KONG.Clive Owens looked better in KING ARTHUR.This movie looks better sitting in it's DVD case than playing in your DVD player."
3,Quite a surprise,"Despite the ridiculous plot (I would go in detail, but no spoiling here!), I feel that the writing itself was very good. There were lots of amazing quotes you can learn in this movie, and was somewhat entertaining despite the omission of romance which most movies insert to keep people engaged. I know that Clive Owen is always the heroic bad ass void of emotions, but he plays it so well!My favorite quote ""The hardest thing to learn in life is knowing which bridge to cross and which to burn....I'm the one you burn"""
3,Not too bad,"This movie could've used a little extra of about everything, but is worth watching and has a great shootout. A man chases his white whale, only to finally realize that he can't can't catch it and moves on."
1,Nothing but the truth,"The film has two strong aspects, which are still not enough to earn it 2 stars for me: first, the tourist experience is not bad, considering the visual effects in several places, including a show-down on roofs in Istanbul. Second, Armin Mueller-Stahl as former Stasi Colonel and current head of security or something for a rogue international gangster bank has this marvellous line:The difference between truth and fiction is that fiction must make sense.Whow. This proves that the film must be fact.Otherwise, don't waste your time, it is enough that I did it."
2,Unthrilling thriller,"Here's a thriller that will leave you curiously unmoved. It involves a bank based in Luxembourg buying Chinese arms to sell around the world with the aim of controlling something or other -- I was never quite sure what.Clive Owens is an Interpol agent, Naomi Watts plays an assisant DA from Manhattan. The two have zero chemistry.The bad guys are never really developed so there's no-one to root against, just a vague unseen enemy. The scene shifts from Berlin to Milan to Istanbul -- but there's no sense of place. The biggest scene is a violent shoot-out in the Guggenheim Museum in New York -- I felt more sorry for the damage being done to the building than the bullets thudding into the various characters.This is a very poor effort."
2,"Visually stunning, Dramatically flat","""The International"" allegedly stars Clive Owen and Naomi Watts. That's a falsehood. It really stars the architecture of France, Luxembourg and Germany. The two leads have no chemistry, and the banks-as-arms-merchants is tough to swallow. Owen is a disgraced Interpol agent, Watts is NY CIA. I kept thinking that a massive arms shifting plot would have brought in more than just two somewhat hapless agents, but they are the pair that keep throwing themselves at this conspiracy with no back-up. ""The International"" wanted to be a smart thriller, but then it throws in an incredible shoot-out at the Guggenheim Museum. Looks great, but the ""you're kidding, right?"" reflex kicks in. Smart looking does not a smart movie make. Sadly enough, this film is saved from total failure only by the visual aspect....but is that really why you'd want to watch a thriller?"
2,Clive and Naomi fizzle,I wanted to like this movie. It stars two of my favorites Naomi Watts and Clive Owen. It has an interesting concept and it just... misses. The acting is good but it seems to get sidetracked and just doesn't hold you nor does it pay off in the end. It is just missing something and I think that the story just goes awry. Also it has some ridiculous action sequence that is totally unbelievable and not needed at all.
2,I Spent Hours Looking For the Receipt So I Could Return It,"This movie is bad. I would explain the plot, but I never quite got it. Owens is an Interpool agent and Watts works for the US gov't in NY? Ok, got that. The rest was just a confusing mess that never seemed to come together in the end.Be warned: Owens in no James Bond or Jason Bourne and Watts is no Bond girl. There was only one good action scene - a shoot-out in a musuem. The rest was tedious with confusing dialouge. I kept trying to rewind so I could understand what was going on - it never worked.This movie is not a thriller, suspenseful or even a true action flick. It's just a mess - one I would return, if I could find my receipt!"
3,pretty lackluster,"I didn't really care for the International. The storyline focuses around constant, overlong and completely uninteresting conversational segments involving negotiations dealing with debt and the possession of potential powerful weapons from other countries. It was so boring I almost fell asleep. WAY too much boring nothingness getting in the way of what surely could have told a decent story.Even the one sniper segment couldn't save the film because of how unrealistic, exaggerated and unsatisfactory it was. The only memorable part was the intense shooting scene near the end. Of course we'll just forget how downright strange it appeared when one of the bad guys fell to his death down a long staircase. It looked like it came straight from an old Mortal Kombat video game whenever you performed a fatality. Everything else about the International is pure boredom."
2,Espionage twists and turns,"When film, like this one puts me to sleep, then something is just not right. Big time movie actors cannot justify drag on story where spies, politicians, bankers and arm dealers set out to control the world and its events. I found film to be terribly boring. But if one is into guns, shooting and conspiracy theories, this film is for you."
2,"I'd rather have a Barclays....*,","Words fail me!Well, here's a few to be going on with: vapid, insipid, dull, meaningless, silly,boring, flatulent.What were they all thinking?(*with apologies to the late, great Kenneth Williams)."
2,Not Too Good!!!,"This movie was very boring in some parts, and had some action and suspense in other parts. Some scenes were pretty confusing. Clive Owen stars as an agent named Louis Salinger, who tries to bring down a corrupt bank that funds terrorist activities. I probably wouldn't recommend THE INTERNATIONAL!!!"
2,I want my 2hrs back,Waste of my time. I saw this film because director Tom Twyker's amazing Run Local Run (Lola Rennt). This was not that move. Don't expect anything deep or even mildly interesting.
1,What was this?,"This was possibly one of the most boring movies that I've ever seen. There were a whole lot of loose ends and no clear bad guys. I'd give a Short Attention Span Summary, but this would be hard to do for two reasons: 1) It was all I could do to stay awake through a first viewing of the movie; 2) It would take a second viewing to try to put together all the convoluted chracters, and I just don't have any masochistic tendencies.What else? The cinematography was pretty decent, and the acting was also believable. But the movie overall just didn't have enough well directed plot to keep anyone interested.Save your money-- even if this movie shows up on the dollar shelf (where it should be a week or two from now)."
4,Stunning movie- but Digital Copy issue,"Finally got my Amazon Blu-Ray copy just today after renting this film several times. Just love, really love the stunning architecture featured throughout. But discovered that the digital copy code that I was looking forward to using on my new iPad has expired! On 06/02/2010 to be exact. Feel rather ripped off. Amazon says it's am Apple-Sony issue, which I do understand. So now I guess I'll see if either of them will be kind and offer a new code... Anyone else have this issue before?MikeIn702"
4,"good movie, good seller","I really enjoy this movie because of the architecture; I live action movies that are beautiful, like the International and Hero.I order this used and it came quickly and in good condition."
3,Average spy action thriller,"I am always amazed at the viewers who write a very through comprehensive analysis of every action in the movie. I actually just want to know if the movie is worth purchasing or even renting. This movie is a fast passed somewhat confusing complex conspiracy with lots of shooting and good guys getting killed except the hero...I think?. The love interest seems to fade away somewhere at the end and the hero's status is unknown at the end and corruption goes on as forecast by the conspirators. Is he still on the roof and is that the end? Watch it, you will not fall asleep but turn the volume down during the shooting scenes. WELL WORTH WATCHING.."
4,a slow burn in some beutiful locales,"This movie has some incredible locations. And it has that lovely,slow Scandinavian pacing to it. Very nice blu-ray product.Clive adopts a fairly intense persona, and carries that throughthe entire movies. So it's a long, slow burn in a scenic, slow-pacedfilm. It takes some patience, but it is very lovely to look at.And the story is interesting enough. You've seen the same storybefore, but it is on a grand scale, on a grand stage.Beautiful visually, and a fun story. Well worth watching a few times.International intrigue on the big screen, very nice."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"While I have been shopping for a very decent pair of diamond earrings, I was a little disappointed at what I received. Even though they were nice, for being 1/2 carat, they were very, very, small. I feel the price would had been somewhat reasonable if the diamonds actually looked like they were 1/2 carat."
4,"The best version of the ""Hound"" ever made!","Basil Rathbone, epitimizes the essence of Sir C.Doyle's Sherlock Holmes! Being a fan of the colorful sleuth for years, I have seen almost all the Sherlock Holmes movies ever made. To date, no one conveys the total character to me as well as Mr. Rathbone did. The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of my favorite Sherlock tales and I have seen almost every flick made from this delightful titillating tale. Mr. Rathbone's is by far the best rendition. I highly recommend it for the diehard Sherlock Holmes ""hounds""."
5,The Only One,"This was the only true Conan Doyle mystery that Basil got to do, in this set of 14 world reknown films.....I am very happy to add these last two films, (along with ""Adventures..."") to the DVD library....let's hope they get the transfer treatment they deserve."
5,Terrific movie,"I loved this movie when I first saw it and now I""m glad I have one for myself. This is the exact one I wanted too. Thanks Rainey"
3,The errie sight of the howling hound c alls to you,"This DVD is a great example of the direction in which Mr. Rathbone, and Mr. Bruce approached their roles of Holmes and Watson. One a stiff, but compelling characterization; but the other to make the good doctor into a ""buffoon"". I enjoyed this until I managed to catch Edward Hardwickes portrayal of the same role in ""The Hound"" from the Granada series.I own both versions, and love the black and white conception: but the portrayals of Mr. Brett, and Mr. Hardwicke far out distance the earlier ones; and it is their version which I would recommend.I liked that the Brett version managed to stay closer to the ACD story also; at any rate catch the sight of the errie hound howling hound whenever you can Sherlock Holmes won't let you down"
4,Only one question remains unanswered...,"I agree with everything thats been said about this amazing picture, so there's little left to add, save from asking the question no-one else seems to: Why on earth is this movie out of print on VHS, let alone not been released on DVD??? The later (inferior) Rathbone/Bruce pairings have all been released countless times on VHS and DVD, but this one, the original and best, still eludes anyone who would buy it now for posterity."
4,It has bite...,"Atmospheric and eerie to the T, `The Hound of the Baskervilles' is rather famous for the chills it was able to induce, and it served as a great launching pad for a very well regarded franchise (proper use of the word Beany?). While I still find the whole breakdown of things to be rather underwhelming (when all is said and done, I wanted a little more `wow' in the end), I must admit that the film still sends shivers in the right moments and carries some eerily effecting set pieces with stunning cinematography that totally captures the mood of the film. Basil Rathbone was a natural in this role, and he served it well many times over. Of all the Sherlock Holmes films, `The Hound of the Baskervilles' is probably the one most remembered, and why not; it packs a serious punch while remaining surprisingly lighthearted in all the right areas, serving up a classic blend of suspense and charm."
5,Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles,"For me, only Basil Rathbone is Sherlock Holmes. I love the way he portrays the charter. Nigel Bruce is the perfect side kick. I enjoy the way their charters play off each other. As far as the story, this was one of my favorites when I was young, guess that's why I still like it."
4,A counter culture Chicano's struggle to find his identity.,"Acosta's Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo is a journey through the most desperate six months of his life which happen to be right in the middle of the psychadelic ""drop-out"" sixties. This is the story of a man whose pain is made real, whose roots are in question, and whose society seems fragmented.We travel with him from town to town from San Francisco to Mexico in all sorts of environments. In each town he is confronted by another contact zone filled with racism, surrealism and rootlessness.Acosta is brutally honest with himself. He calls himself the Brown Buffalo. Him and his people, killed not out of necessity but for excess. Their skins became coats and their heads were mounted on walls. They were a people used, abused and driven from their lands.Acosta ends his book where his life actually begins as Zeta, a leader to the Chicano people, the Brown Buffalos."
1,Just who's deceived here?,"This book will enlighten you about nothing. It is extremely clear for anyone reading the Bible: God doesn't let you in on everything that He is doing in the universe. Groothius' viewpoint isn't only uniformed about NDE's, he lacks ANY firsthand experience with the phenomenon. I'm a born again Christian and yet I don't believe her book verbatim. But it is clear she is a Christian who has Christ as her savior. What makes Groothius believe like he's some incredible expert. The tight, unforgiving, fundamentalist views he clings to just doesn't hold water.As for the person who reviewed the book and thinks NDE's are all some new-age pyscho-babble, the person has absolutely zilch knowledge about the subject. NDE's have been RECORDED throughout history in various ways, not just in our time. Get off the couch and do some research. Groothius doesn't seem to get any of this and just appears to be working to make money from his book."
5,Just buy it,"Unless you want/need all of the fancy options or larger bread loaves then just get this bread maker. It is easy, fast, relatively small and cheap, loaves are just right size, and very easy cleanup. The cleanup is important because I find I do not use other kitchen items such as my pasta maker as much because it is too much for cleanup."
5,Love it!,"I felt secure ordering this thing after reading all the positive reviews, and I certainly was not let down. Just got it yesterday and I'm really enjoying it. Super easy to use and clean, and I look forward to trying the many recipes provided and creating a few of my own."
2,Gotta like sweet bread,"I bought this a couple of years ago, used it 3 times and it's been sitting on the shelf since then. While I love how fast it is and how it makes nice small loaf, what I don't like is how all the recipes included call for some form of sweetener (sugar, honey, etc.), and it's usually an amount that is noticiable in the final product. For me it's not a health issue so much as a taste issue. I simply prefer savory breads most of the time. Also, even though I used the fast-rise yeast specified, sometimes the granules wouldn't be completely dissolved before it started to cook. I still regret ...what was essentially an impulse buy.There is one good thing about this machine--it got me back into the habit of making my own white bread from scratch."
3,"Yucky! Works great, tastes horrible.","I love everything about this breadmaker, except the taste of the bread. I like plain, white, French bread, and with this breadmaker everything tastes very sweet and yeasty. The flavored breads aren't as bad, but for plain bread, I think it tastes horrible. I made what was probably my seventh loaf of bread tonight and decided that it is just no use. I tried the feta cheese recipe and added some olives as suggested. But the sugary-yeasty taster prevailed. I am giving the machine away tomorrow."
1,Produces Horrible Bread,"I ended up donating this to appliance. While easy to use, the resulting bread is tasteless, dry & not worth the effort."
2,It's ok,"Breadmaker works great...does make a small loaf of bread in 45 minutes as advertized. However, all recipes seem to have the same texture...which isn't unpleasant, but not exciting. We use it in our RV with lots of success. It just doesn't make bread like our regular breadmaker that we have at home. It's also very difficult to adapt regular breadmaker recipes to this size...and, if they aren't exactly right, the bread isn't too good. So, it seems that you're limited to using only the recipes in the booklet that accompanies the breadmaker."
4,Great Little Breadmaker,"For just 2 people, this will make fresh bread in a minimum amount of time. I had to adjust the recipes slightly to get a better loaf however. First, decrease the sugar to 3/4 Tbl., increase the salt to 1/2 tsp. and use 2 Tbl. of dry milk in any of the recipes that require it. Put in all the ingredients ending with the flour topped by the yeast. After starting the breadmaker, I wait until the first knead is done and unplug the machine, set a timer for 15 minutes - when it goes off, I restart the breadmaker and let it complete the cycles. I find the extra rise makes a difference in the appearance of the bread, it comes out light and tasty!Once you play with the recipes a little, you can get a restaurant quality loaf anytime at home, with a minimum amount of effort!"
2,Not many features,"I bought this bread machine about two years ago, and I've used about a handful of times. It makes a decent small loaf of bread, but that's about it. It doesn't have a timer or a knead-only cycle. It is difficult to adapt recipes for the normal sized loaves (despite what the instruction book says), so you are pretty much stuck with the recipes that come with the machine. The plus side is that this little machine makes a decent small loaf of bread in a short period of time. If you only want to make fresh bread for dinner, then this machine will meet your needs."
5,Bread Fit for a King,"I read the reviews for this breadmaker and absolutely couldn't resist buying one for my small family. My son is a 19 year-old college student, and one of his favorite pastimes is eating me out of house and home. He loves bread. My West Bend breadmaker arrived today, and I made bread for the first time in my life. My first attempt at breadmaking turned out beautifully! As I am writing this review my son is finishing his second slice.Yes, it is a small loaf, but this small loaf will feed four people easily. The directions and recipes are easy to follow, and clean-up was a snap. I highly recommend this breadmaker to anyone who loves to serve their family hearty fare.Bon Appetite!"
5,"Very good bread, perfect size loaf","I got this for my parents for Christmas (2003) and they can't say enough good things about it. They rave about the taste of the bread, claiming it is the best they have had from a bread machine. It makes a loaf in 45 minutes or so, and the size is just right for 2 - 4 people. As long as the machine continues to function, my rating will remain five stars!"
5,"Perfect Size, Fantastic Performance","I've had this perfect little bread for several months now and just love it. Every loaf turns out just fine including the ones where I've substituted ingredients willy-nilly. I've had many other bread makers and they were either too noisy, didn't mix ingredients well, or, usually, turned out loaves that were too big to eat before they turned stale. This turns out a perfect small sized loaf. If you eat it too quickly, it is easy enough to make another. Just remember to let the unit cool down before starting another batch.I do always check when the unit is mixing because when I sub ingredients they sometimes don't mix in as well and I just use my finger (usually clean of course) to shove everything together. It is so easy and convenient that I use it several times a month, unlike other bread machines that I was lucky to use several times a year."
5,Toss the larger machines!,I have a 2 pound machine and once I got this machine the larger one is now a dust collector. I start bread when I get home from work and it's ready for dinner. We especially love the Italian Herb reciepe that comes with the machine. There is nothing like the smell of fresh baked bread!
3,It is OK working.,"I can't say it is wonderful, I can only say it is good for making a dough.It is hard for making a crispy bread by this machine, at least for me, I have tried 5 times, the bread is only OK."
5,Not a bad loaf yet!,"OK, I'll say right away that this machine makes a small loaf, about 3/4 of a pound and roughly 4 X 6 X 4"" high. I -- and the machine -- keep busy, especially while our nephew is staying with us. This bread has a way of vanishing because it's so good. I've made white bread, wheat bread, raisin bread and my house specialty, wheat with oatmeal and walnuts. Every loaf delicious. The machine takes only 45 minutes from start to finish.After my experience with a DIFFERENT BRAND of machine -- waiting hours only to throw out some soggy rejects, I'm especially happy with this one. May it last for years!"
5,"""just For Dinner"" is ""Just Perfect""","I am a bread fanatic and previously have used several different breadmakers. However, I have limited counter space in my kitchen and most regular breadmakers are gigantic! ""Just For Dinner"" is compact, portable and easily fits in my kitchen cabinets. Susbstantively, it is a great breadmaker. Each loaf bakes perfectly and slides right out of the pan. Moreover, I can make a loaf right before dinner so that it's still warm when I serve it. The loaf size also is perfect. It feeds approximately four people so I don't have stale bread sitting around for days. The price is right and I am very happy with this product. I highly recommend it to those who love bread but don't want complicated machines or lengthy bake times. Buy it!!!"
5,Just Right all the time!,"Here are a few reasons I like this breadmaker:1. Great deal for the money.2. Perfect size loaves for my little family.3. No wasted bread.4. Quick and easy for our busy days.5. Great taste and texture.I like to make homeade food for my family, but I don't really have too much time for it. The rounds out a perfect meal for our weekends which I take pride in: The bread takes just 45 minutes, during which time I put ingredients together for various homeade soups, let my soup simmer, make homeade butter with the kids in 15 minutes, and everything is done at the same time. Leftover bread is used in the morning to either make sandwiches for my 2nd grader's lunch, or toasted with peanut butter on top for a quick breakfast."
4,"They replaced it, no problem","The first one arrived broken from Amazon. I called the manufacturer and they sent a new one, without any hassles, and that one works just fine. I wish you could set it to let the bread rise a bit more, but I guess its simplicity is what makes it so affordable."
4,Great Gift,"Bought for my 80yr old dad for Christmas and he loves it. Simple to use, nice small loaf of bread. He enjoys experimenting with different type breads. Overall a nice little machine."
5,Best little bread machine,"Found this bread machine on Amazon.com and requested it as a ...gift. Well I was not disappointed! We are empty nesters and this is a great machine for bread for 2 to 4. Use it for sandwiches, french toast or with dinner choosing from the several recipes provided in the Instruction booklet. Highly recommend it if you want a small loaf of great bread!!"
5,Just for two bread maker by West Bend,"What a great addition to our crowded kitchen! Works as advertized and provides enough for 3 or four eaters; if not too hungry. Yup, I say buy it, try it and you'll love it in your kitchen."
5,I love my bread machine,"I bought this on Amazon used and I have used it off and on for a few years now. What a great way to save money and enjoy fresh homemade bread.Since the economy has gone south, I have been making my own bread. I have gotten comfortable enough to alter the recipe slightly to make personal improvements - like adding more margarine so it is less dry. It means more calories but I don't mind. Oh did I mention that the bread is done under an hour?!Since I am using it so much, I think I need to purchase a new pot and mixing paddle but I don't mind since I depend on this appliance so much."
5,Love this Breadmaker!!,I have had this breadmaker for many months now and it has done perfect on every loaf I have made. I have tried almost every recipe that came with it and they have ALL turned out wonderful. Yes the loaves are small but they are enough for me and my sweet hubby! I highly recommend this product!
4,Love it,It's quick and quiet. Those are two things my past bread machine lacked. Perfect for my kitchen. Fits right into the corner nicely. We use it daily.
5,awesome machine...,"this is the first time I have experimented with using a bread machine. Did not realize making bread could be this simple and fast. This machine rocks - the bread got done in under 45 minutes! On the very first attempt we got a perfect loaf, with a good crust. The loaf may be a little small though, but for a family of 2, it is plenty."
5,"Wonderful, Quick, and Handy","I have only had this little wonder for about a week and have found it to be a tremendous little device. It does just what it is advertised to do....small delicious loaves in 45 minutes. It's great to have fresh, healthy bread available at all times baked just right. It's so easy to make a loaf. All the work is gone but the fun and great taste are there in abundance."
1,Great Bread - Great Recipes,"My wife and I make a loaf about every other day. Whole wheat is a stable but Italian, Rye and Raisin are baked frequently. We enjoy the consistancy of the bread and find that the time it takes to prepare and bake does not interfer with our time.The rating should be a five!!! made an entry error."
5,Worth the wait,"THREE YEARS I had this little gem on my Christmas list, because I couldn't justify buying yet another appliance. Besides, I already have a full-size breadmaker. But WOW! I'm glad somebody actually gave it to me this year. I have made 3 loaves of bread, and I'm very impressed, and my husband is as well. It produces a loaf a little bigger than the ones of the size you get at Outback, with marvelous flavor. It's quick, it's easy, and it's worth every penny!"
2,Not worth the trouble,"This is suppose to be one of the best bread machine within its price range. But after a month of tedious learning and adjusting; it still didn't turn out any good bread. The quality of the bread were substantially inferior to what one could pick up from the local market, and the process to make them was really time consuming. I would say either pay more money to get a higher grade bread machine, or stick to your local bakery instead."
5,Breadmaker,Had ordered it from someone else prior and never received it. Placed the order with this vender and they processed and shipped item expeditiously.My parents love it!
2,Just for dinner and half the counter,The Just for dinner breadmaker DOES make a small loaf of bread in a short amount of time. However it takes up as much counterspace as a regular breadmaker and will probably be relegated to a back cupboard due to the size and inconvenience of using it.
2,"Good tea, lousy price","I bought this as well as the Pantainorasingh Thai Tea Mix on a quest to save money by making the things I like at home. This tea is very close to what I've gotten in Thai restaurants, but the price is outrageous...especially after shipping. I bought these two teas before venturing to my local Asian food market - stupid, I know. But when I got to the market, I found the price on thai mixes to be between $2.50-$4. So it's not even the shipping that makes the price high. It's good, but not enough to warrant paying the extra cost.And if you're looking to make Thai Iced Tea, don't follow the recipe on the label. I found a recipe online that works out very well - 6 cups water, 1 cup sugar (or splenda), 1 cup tea."
5,Excellent for those looking for restaurant Thai Tea taste,"I've been browsing amazon and other tea sellers for authentic restaurant style Thai Tea. This one is exactly what I was looking for.Amazing taste and extremely easy to make. Instructions that are provided show easy ways to make the tea, and the traditional long boil.However, in my morning rush, I simply use some of the tea in a coffee machine (1/2 tbsp per cup of water) and it comes out excellent with some cream and sugar.Definitely recommended."
5,Por Kwan Thai Tea mix,"This mix, is a blend of leaves that are really fine, we made it in the coffee maker. I did purchase the cloth strainer, but that should be used for large amounts of tea. The coffee maker did just fine, make sure you don't use too much mix though, it's concentrated stronger than coffee is, so please take note of the instructions when it comes to measurement.It tastes delicious, just like I like it. I did not have condensed milk though, so I had to use regular milk. I will admit you definitely need the condensed milk if you want it to be like the restaurant's style. But it had the same flavors, the regular milk tended to water it down a bit.I sweetened it with normal sugar, everything was fine.This is a nice size bag, you should have enough for awhile with this one. I recommend this if you love Thai Tea like I do.."
1,"Right flavor, but very very weak.","This tea has the right general flavor for thai iced tea, but we haven't been able to get enough of that flavor out of it. Even after quadrupling the amount of tea per cup of water, it's still weak. I'm disappointed."
3,Just ok.,It was ok. I tried a Thai ice tea that was great and spicey. I could actually taste the different spices and flavours but unfortunelty I didn't get it from this tea. It's good but not what I was looking for.
4,"Good tea, buy it somewhere else","This is a good tea for thai tea, but now I buy it locally at an asian grocery for about $3.50. Not worth it for what you pay here."
5,works for me!,Por Kwan was really quite good. I used about 3/4 cup of leaves into the coffee maker with a full pot of water. Add almost a cup of sugar and throw it in the fridge. Top with half and half and you've got exactly what they're serving in most any thai restaurant. I will order this product again.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I've never been a big fan of thai tea, but my husband loves it, so I looked on Amazon for a thai tea I could make myself. I've always found that if I make something myself, it's more enjoyable than when I buy it pre-made, and this tea is no exception. I boiled it as directed and strained it through a coffee filter; the first time I made it I mixed it with sweetened condensed milk, which was very tasty. I then tried it with soy milk and a little honey which I liked even better. Added some boba that I also got on Amazon...Heaven. The only beef I have is that it has food coloring, which I try to avoid in my diet. I expected something more on the lines of whole leaves, but this was pretty powdery, which wasn't a problem, just not what I was visualizing. Overall, I'm glad I purchased it; my husband loves it and I enjoy it a lot, too. No more restaurant thai iced tea for me!"
1,buyer beware,"I bought this cat food as per the breeders recommendation with out checking out the history of the food.My sweet kitten started throwing up this food,i checked every aspect of my kittens heath and changed his foodand he was find , no longer vomiting. he had been eating it since he could eat dry food and then,I think something in it buids up in his system and then every day and night about 30 mins after he eats he becomes sick. He was still playfull and I was not about to wait until he became really ill. I've stopped giving him this food and he's hasn't been sick since so buyer beware,this company was part of the recall in 2008."
4,"High Quality, Mixes Well","This dry food is great for combining with high-quality wet foods. Our Savannah is a very picky eater, but he enjoys this dry food mixed with wet and will even eat the dry alone. Larger bag is convenient for storage but small enough for daily use."
1,you can't just listen and learn,"I wish I didn't buy this.1. You can't just listen and learn: you MUST have the book with you. Why? THEY DON'T SAY WHAT THE WORDS ARE IN ENGLISH BEFORE SAYING THE GERMAN WORD. They just start speaking in German.2. The only thing they do on the CD is pronounce things.3. The CD track names are: Lesson 1, Lesson 2, etc and not things like: Numbers, Greetings, etc4. The book is not very informative for beginners. I don't know what someone who already knows how to speak German would say, but I'm not really learning a thing."
2,Not a program for Tournament Players,"As a player over 2000 USCF for many years, I value ease of playing conditions. The game is hard enough. (Even Alekhine said that ""Chess will be the master of us all."") The graphics are unsympathetic for ease of play. The desert 2D is probably the most viewable. Beware of seeing black pieces on black squares. There is a long, noisy start-up that KIDS will like. And the effects showing blown-up pieces will thrill them. The engine is strong even on the beginner level. If you can find this expensively used-which is likely due to mass-production and overstock-it could interest a young player that does not have a defined interest in chess. If your son or daughter becomes more interested in ""The Royal Game"", you can upgrade with one of the many very economical members of the Chessmaster series."
1,worse,"The woman at the spa I go to is really hooked up on this stuff and praises it all the time. I've tried it and I am really not sure if it helps and perhaps even makes things worse.I know that zinc itself is great antinflamatory but this thing has a ton of vitamin B6, which actually is a probable cause for acne from what I've read. So perhaps looking for a zinc supplement without the B6 will be a better choice. Also omega-3/fish oil supplements might be something to try.As for this one (if you do decide to try it) the pills are not too big but I found them tricky to swallow because they are a bit porous so they stick to tongue/mouth. You have to keep them in your mouth with some water to make sure they've absorbed some of it and won't get stuck when you're swallowing. Weird."
3,Good product,"This product was received quickly and exactly as described. I have heard others have had a boost in clarity of their acne, I unfortunately did not find this to be the case. To be completely honest, most of this can be found in a multi-vitamin, and I had much greater success with high dose garlic (Such as Allicillin or similar product)."
2,Horrible!!,I only give it 2 stars because the shipper provided great service. This product made my face burn and itch and white heads appeared all over my face within a week! I'm a African American femal with combination skin I have more scars than ance but I thought this would help get rid of the few bumps that I did have. Wrong!! I know dermatologist say when you begin to use a new product it'll get worse before it gets better but after 1 week I just couldn't take it anymore. This may work wonders for some but it did nothing good for me.
2,Didn't work for me,"I've suffered with terrible acne since I was about 11 years old. I've tried just about everything under the sun to help clear up my skin with minimal success. This product didn't seem to do anything for me in terms of clearing up my skin. I'm giving it two stars because although it didn't clear my skin up, it also didn't make it worse or cause any other odd side effects. I guess this product could be worth a try if you're also suffering from acne, it just wasn't for me."
2,it doesn't work,"I feel dizzy, weak, and sleepy every time I take it, with or without meal, with or without other vitamin; and my acne even gets worse! It perhaps not the zinc's fault, but it's not good enough though:("
2,Hard to swallow,"I have not yet actually taken them.It was my first time taking some about.. an hour ago.The one thing I REALLY don't like is that they're hard to swallow.They're small but,When I opened it, powder came outThe pills look and feel smooth, but once you put water in your mouthIt gets kinda grainy and sticks to your tongue making it hard to swallow.I'll try to keep taking them.I hate pills like these."
1,Horrible,"Zinc for acne pills are a hoax - I returned them and didn't get a refund. There's enough trouble in the bottle to drive you mad. My acne is now 100x worse than before, no thanks."
1,DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"This product is absolutely terrible I have been taking it for a week and it broke out my face! I have a lot worse acne than I did a week ago these pills suck and certainly do not improve acne, maybe it'll work for some people maybe it won't. BUYER BEWARE: do not waist your 3.99"
1,Doesn't work,"Girls, birth control works better for acne (if your acne is hormonal). Other than that, boys and girls, ""Clean Start bedtime for breakouts"" works much better."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"This product did not work. I took the pills everyday, and continue to accumulate acne. Do not believe everything you read on this site. I had to find out the hard way."
5,Didnt work for me tho.,"Maybe it was cause i was to unpatient and stopped taking it. Then started again. Which is not good for results. I ordered a nutreogena pproduct for only 7 bucks(2 days shipping with prime) and it got better reviews. PLus this stuff taste bad, really bad! I decided to give it 5 stars because it was probably my fault."
3,nope,worked at the beginning and then stopped working. Margarite pill + tea tree oil+ Clarins lotus oil has cleared up my face and makes me glow. I have dry skin.
2,Didn't work for me.,"I did not see any difference in my skin whatsoever from taking these. I believe that our bodies respond to a lot of what we have going on in our lives. Maybe it's hormones, diet, or stress. I stopped drinking after heavily drinking for a year, and my acne disappeared."
5,Fantastic Product,"I am a long time acne sufferer. At times my face looked so bad I missed class because I was so embarrassed. I know everyone says they've tried everything but I actually mean it. Nothing cleared my face besides medication from my dermatologist, but that stuff is expensive and on a college budget I couldn't afford it. I am almost finished with this bottle and am about to purchase my second. I went from 20+ zits, pimples, white heads, black heads and everything else you can imagine to 5 small pimples. The reason this product worked for me is due to the type of acne I have, which is toxicity acne. I strongly urge you to figure out what specific type of acne you suffer from and treat that. I'm now in the process of evening my skin tone and getting rid of the acne scars which takes time. But I wouldn't be at this point without the Zinc. Great purchase."
5,Works Great!,Nothing Really Worked for me but Zinc For Acne Tablets Worked Great! I will make sure i buy more tablets!!!
2,Did not clear up my moderate acne,"I am finishing off my first bottle and unfortunately this product did not clear up my moderate acne. I am 25 with acne on my forehead, cheeks, and chin. I've been dealing with it for three years now. It started after I took an emergency contraceptive, so I believe it is hormone related. I do believe this product may have lightened up my skin though, in a good way. It seems as though the hyper pigmentation has subsided.Good luck on your journey with acne. It makes you stronger.I started taking this B-5 pantothenic acid pill, it may do the trick.Pan Acid (Pantothenic Acid) 1000mg Timed Release - 100 - Sustained Release Tablet"
2,not working so far....,"I purchased this product along with the Murad Acne Complex Kit. it received positive reviews so i was convinced to give it a try. So far, i don't see any positive results yet. My acne has actually gotten a little worse since i started using the murad acne kit along with the zinc pills. however, i was warned of this which is why i'm still using the products. i'll continue taking the pills until they run out. If i don't see any positive results, i'll just refrain from purchasing again and will be sure to publish a final review of this product to aid other potential buyers in their decision. it only cost me $8 so it's not huge loss."
3,What does this do???,"I mean seriously, one order will not work. I just finished the bottle and still have acne. This is no miracle cure. This is a supplement that you would have to continuously take just like any other daily vitamin. Maybe after a year I would see a difference, but nothing now. I'm going to see if I can find this in a Whole Foods or local health food store to save on shipping."
1,It broke my son out.,My son was allergic to this product. It gave him hives but benadryl cleared it write up. I will not buy it again.
1,Product didnt work.. for me.,"I suffer from cystic acne, and before going to the dermatologist and spending $200 for the visit, and $xxx (or more) on medication, I thought I would give this a try.I purchased one bottle, and after taking it for a full 45 days, I noticed no change. Matter of fact, my condition got worse.After reading various reviews of this product, and the raves some members gave it, I really did have high hopes it would work. After stopping the product, my condition returned to the state it was prior to taking it. Since buying, and stopping this product, I resorted to seeing a dermatologist.As the saying goes, ""everyone's different"", so keep that in mind when buying this product. It could work, or it couldnt, its all in the way your body reacts to it."
5,worked for husband,I bought this for myself and my husband ended up taking it over so I let him have it. He doesnt have a lot of acne but was starting to get a few here and there. This really cleared it up to nothing after only a couple weeks of taking it. When he stopped they started to pop up again so we really believe it works great.
1,Major breakout!,"I was hoping to finally find an answer to my acne and thought to buy this since it had good reviews. Unfortunately, this made it worse! :( I started breaking out even more and stopped taking them. I did some research and found out a high level of B6 can actually cause more acne than help. I guess I'm one of the unlucky ones..."
4,Not for Vegetarians,"I'm sure this is a good product, however, as a vegetarian I was disappointed when I received the product that it is full of fish oils. I had to throw them in the trash. I did find a Zinc that is for vegetarians:Now Foods, Zinc Gluconate 50 mghttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HV9O0/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&m;=ATVPDKIKX0DERI think the seller should put the ingredients on the product description."
2,Definitely not a miracle cure or even a fast one,"I purchased this after reading so many comments in here from people that claimed seeing results in a week or two. I have moderate acne and didn't see any result so far - in fact I got a bit worse (probably not because of the zinc) and finally gave up and went to see a dermatologist. He told me that my routine was totally wrong and that I had been way too aggressive with my skin. When I asked him about the zinc he said that they are not proven and in any case a really low-yield solution for the long term for me, so I could continue it if it pleased me, and prescribed other antibiotics. In any case, don't expect miracles..."
4,Great!! So far.,"Bought this for my 12 year old daughter. Her acne was getting pretty bad. Tried other things with no real results. She started taking Zinc 2 weeks ago. I started to see a difference after first week. And then this morining, WOW!!. What a difference, her cheeks and chin are almost clear. I am telling everyone i know about this."
2,No results,The good: easy to swallow. cheap.The bad: I didn't really get any visible results.I probably will not buy it again.
2,Really?,"While the seller got this item to me in a very timely fashion, the product is pretty much a scam. Sure you can use the little piece of plastic that comes with it to slow your swing down, but the training aid easily becomes either a crutch or inhibits further swing development.As for the DVD, there is about a three minute instructional segment for four or five different shots. The pros go way to fast through the segments leaving me and a buddy bewildered as to what we are suppose to do.Yes some of the money in this product backs a good charity. But I would have rather given my money to the charity and bought a bucket of balls at the local range for practice."
1,A waste of $8.,"The book jacket claims to ""share the secrets of the Cordon Bleu's famous kitchens."" Hardly. Since when are Toll House cookies a secret special recipe?There are no special techniques taught and the cookie recipes are readily available in any cooking magazine or even in your grandmother's Good Housekeeping cookbook.A better alternative would be Rose Levy Beranbaum's cookie book or ANY other cookbook!"
3,basic sailing,"A good lesson DVD but leaves a lot out. Like knot tying, sailing close to the wind,maneuvering in small areas, docking, sailing off from the dock, and others. Gives fair advice to the beginner."
5,Beautiful!,"I bought this book right before my first trip to Paris. It was full of beautiful pictures and stories about Petite Trianon, the Hameau and Gardens. It made the visit to these places all the more interesting because I knew a lot of the stories behind various pieces of furniture, room decor and furniture. It helped me envision her life in her beloved sanctuary before the revolution. If you are planning a trip to Versailles it is a wonderful book to help transport you back to this graceful and elegant period in History."
1,Much better information on Marie Antoinette elsewhere,"I was expecting something really great based on the other reviews. I purchased this book used and even then it was a waste. I have been to Versailles and saw firsthand where the royals lived. There are other books that give grander and better pictures and information than this one. Most of the pictures in this book especially of the hamlet are previously published. Then as someone stated the Meridien, where Marie Antoinette liked to spend most of her time, was in black and white.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,A piece of carp,I was extremely disappointed in this book. This is a junk book you'd pick up at a souvenier shop. It takes a worthier and more particular kind of person to appreciate entire pages devoted to a few inches of motif taking up entire pages.
2,Was not impressed with this book at all,"After reading the reviews on this book I was expecting so much more than what I got. Some of the pictures in the book are beautiful, but most of them are grainy and shot at strange angles. The pictures of the petit trianon, which were the pictures I was looking forward to seeing the most, were all shot in black and white and there are only 6 pictures of it total. You get absolutely no feeling for it whatsoever and this was the place Marie Antoinette loved the most and spent most of her time. Overall I was very disappointed and would not recommend this book."
2,SOMETHINGS LOST,"Jimmy Buffett is a great story-teller in the singing kind of vein. I am one of his bigger Parrot Heads and it muses me to say, ""This thing sucks!"". Don't approach it. Maps and legends not-with-standing, all stories bore like crazy. I don't want to drag my hero through the mud any more, so I'll close with the familiar caveat, ""THIS THING SUCKS!"". Avoid like the Barrier Reef!"
2,Good start...then falls apart,"I dunno, I read all these raves and wonder if everyone read the same book I did!The first story about Tully Mars is terrific, the second about a small town football team is pretty good, then...the book falls apart with repetitive filler material.Stories that are honest or heartfelt doesn't mean much if all the characters feel the same....and WAY too much detail.So, Read the first two stories, then put it down, you won't miss anything....probably just needed enough pages to justify a book rather than a short story or two in a magazine.For the record: I am a moderate fan of Jimmy Buffetts music, his best stuff is legendary, but I am not a fan of every single song."
3,More JB,"I enjoyed reading all his books. Even envied him a bit. Amazing music and lifestyle. I'm now a former fan. Don't think he's gonna be around for much longer and don't wanna watch it. Too bad really. Saw him live about a year or two ago. Totally wasted. Terrible waste. Met many ""Parrot Heads"" in U.S. Virgin Islands. Most of them couldn't walk by sundown. Following thier leader JB I guess."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","If you are a fan of Buffett's, you'll enjoy this book for about all it gives you. I found myself rolling my eyes whenever he pulled out a line or phrase from one of his books, and found some of the stories more interesting than others. They aren't consistent--it's like he decided he needed a love story here, a sports story there...I liked that he repeated characters we would meet in one story and write about them, so you got to know people, but some of the stories were trite and almost like he wrote them without any editing. I would have preferred if he didn't jump forward and then back and then forward again in time, but all in all I'm not sorry I read it.More than once, the ""I love you, but I have to live my own life"" plot was used, food is often mentioned (and in great detail) and of course the sea is always present almost as a character in and of itself.Just not sure I'd recommend it to anyone but a true Parrothead."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book after A Pirate Looks at 50, which I loved; so maybe I was expecting too much. His story lines were somewhat interesting, but his characters were so stereotypically one dimensional I just couldn't care what happened to them. The book seemed amateurish, and I don't think it was worth the time it took to read."
1,bad book,"First of all, I love Jimmy Buffett. I've been to a bunch of concerts, and I am a big Parrot Head. But Jimmy Is a lousy writer. I mean, his writing skills are simply terrible. I felt like I was reading a book written by a 12 year old. Not only that, but the story line is terrible. I know other Parrot heads will tear me apart over this review, but honestly the man can't write. Sorry Jimmy and friends."
5,"Okay, so you know the song... now read the stories!","Margaritaville is Jimmy Buffett's biggest hit, and if your knowledge of him ends there, that's okay. This book of short stories, some fiction, some autobiographical, is excellent tropical escapism at its finest. Love, triumph, coming-of-age, you can almost pick the archetype, and in one way or another, he addresses it with a magnificent cast of characters, from the bizarre friends in our own neighborhoods, to good-natured scoundrels we'd love to emulate if we could, to the girl next door we wish we could reconnect with.Buffett's descriptive style is reminiscent of Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon books, and it works so well, you can almost see exactly where the characters are walking to in their towns, smell the aromas, hear the townspeople in the street, etc. Rumor has it that a studio optioned the book... I can't wait to see the movie!"
5,ABSOLUTE DELIGHT TO READ,"A number of years ago, a friend gave me this book..a going away present. Finally I read it. Now I regret not doing so much sooner. This is a wonderful, lighthearted read and sparks my faith that the art of writing short stories has been not lost. I must admit to being a Buffett fan, not a fanatic, but never-the-less, a fan. These stories just add spice to listening to his music. Mr. Buffett certainly has talent. His writing certainly show cases his free spirit and attitude. Wish there were more like him around. I would highly recommend this one for anyone looking for a good time reading and recommend it to anyone searching for a good bit of writing thrown in. Trust me, you will enjoy this one."
3,Fun for Parrotheads,"As a Buffett fan, I had to read this book. The short stories were entertaining - all the more enjoyable if you are familiar with his songs. As one would expect from Jimmy Buffett, sailing and Caribbean adventure punctuate the book, which was fun - but quite frankly the same devices got a little old after awhile. Many characters seemed to be cut from the same cloth (no matter what the story), and the plot lines were uniformly simple. Buffett is a fine musician and songwriter - but he leaves something to be desired as a writer."
5,A Vacation When You Need One,"This book is masterful. The characters and familiar, yet intriguing. You always feel that there is more to the characters life and times, that a book can be written on each subject. I don't go that much for short stories because I usually find them too shallow, not enough setting or environment. This work is the exact opposite of everything I don't like about short stories."
4,Tales From Margaritaville,"It was in good condition. It had not been read but the bottom binding was alittle dirty. Not anything to complain about. We now have a complete collection of all of Buffets books again. Someone had ""borrowed"" this one from us and it never was returned. Thanks to Amazon again!"
4,Buffetesque,"While not as good as Joe Merchant or A Pirate Looks at 50, this is still a good, easy read. Highly recommended reading that is very Buffett like. The stories are entertaining, I wish the book were longer, though, this seemed like such a quick read."
2,Save your money for a better grinder,"I've been using the Krups 402-70 grinder for the last 9 months now and it works fine..if you grind good cuts of meat with no fibers. Otherwise with cheaper cuts, the blade gets clogged with the meat fibers pretty much 10 seconds into grinding and untangling them is a pain in the butt. Also, the blade dulled very quickly and is difficult to re-sharpen. One of the most disappointing parts of the grinder is of the two plates with different size holes for the meat to be pushed out. They are not stainless steel, rust easily and produces a funky smell. After I wash these plates I need to dry them right away before they start to rust. If you truly need a meat grinder, look into getting something else. I think once we burn out this one, i'll get something with a little more power than the 150W Krups has to offer."
4,"Does a fine job, if you know what you're DOING!!!","I don't want to be critical of the last several reviewers, BUT... What kind of a doofus puts tendons into a meat grinder?ONLY boneless and skinless meat should be put into it! DUHH!This is perfectly good grinder if you are reasonably skilled using a meat grinder, and if you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!"
4,Well compiled.,"I was pleasently surprised to read a book as refreshing and as information packed as this..I have read several nutrition books in the past, but few of them have come as close to the cutting edge of nutrition technology such as this.Not only does it include a comprehensive listing of key nutrients such as Whey Protien and essential fatty acids, but it elaborates, in lucid terms, the benefits, as well as arguments in favor of nutritional supplements, as well as tips and precautions that one must take, in order to ensure that you are purchasing the right supplement. It's a must have for all those who believe that nutrition is now no longer a health related subject but an ever evolving complex science, that can slow or reverse most of the common diseases afflicted by man.After reading this book, every reader will only have to carry this book to the supermarket and / or supplement store to find the food that's perfectly suited to thim / her."
2,tough to review,"Shaw's latest collection is a tough one to review. While there are no poems that stand out as horrible, none really stand out as that great. The longish poem, ""An Exhumation"" is fairly interesting, but the rest of the poems fall short. He has an impressive list of places where his poems have been published, which might be the most memorable thing about the book."
3,Cute,"I bought this as a x-mas present for a 8yr old, she adores this purse so much. Its pretty, and cute. I think any girl or woman who like Hello Kitty, would love this."
4,lasare,"Fascinating account on the formation & operation of the secret service. This is an inclusive text book and not a novel, so tends to be a 'dry tome' in parts but I found it a very interesting history and recommend it to anybody similarly interested in this period."
5,The Best Batman Game Ever!!!!!!!!!,"I got this game on my birthday last year on december and it is a really fun game to play with and it was an easy game and it is great and the game is just too cool and in this game you get to use stealth and lean on walls and you get to do amazing combos just like in the movie and it is a really fun game but this game is just an excellent game and a really good game and you should get it,it is worth it!"
1,A better recommendation,"A much better and more scholarly book on this subject is Stephen K. Ray's wonderful text, ""Upon This Rock"" which can be found on Amazon.I recommend that you read Ray's book before reading Svendsen's. While both men are scholars in their own right, Svenden is hampered by a very narrow 20th century ""evangelical"" viewpoint that refuses to take into account the actual history of the Catholic Church from Jesus onwards, and also ignores the extensive writings of the Church Fathers, a vital task that Stephen Ray has carried off magnificently.The Church Fathers consistently point to the unity and authority of the Catholic Church, a fact of history that Svendsen has unfortunately missed completely."
1,Derivative and very disappointing.,This book is a total rehash of information that anyone with a weight problem who has attempted to do anything about it would already know. The book is repetitive and tedious. You must wade through 150+ of obvious information before the unoriginal diet plan is presented. The one redeeming aspect of the book is the excercise suggestion. There are useful tips on getting started excercising and a well-structured body sculpting program using free weights. But this alone is not worth the price of the book.
1,REALLY Bad,"I cannot believe I paid money for this. First of all, it's NOT an instructional DVD. It's purely a demonstration. It's an hour of watching this make up artist put make up on three different asian girls. She never talks about why she's using these techniques or skin tones or anything of any value. She never discusses or mentions the differences of make up for asian women vs caucasion women. She says things like, ""now I'm mixing the foundation"" & ""now I'm putting some color on her eyes"". She mentions in the beginning how important sanitation techniques are and then, to my horror, blows on her brushes and uses lipsticks straight out of the pallette with the same brush. Just really bad."
1,Dirty and NO educational,"She does NOT explain much AT ALL!! She isn't detailed and doesn't tell you to apply WHAT from where to where, why you should do it, and what KIND of tools to use and she uses her BREATH to blow off the excess powder, very unsanitary! She even stresses in the beginning that sterilization is very important when working on other people. She may be a good/ experienced makeup artist (personally, I don't think so), but she is a HORRIBLE teacher! Don't waste your money... I borrowed this from the library and it STILL was a waste. Better off watching youtube makeup gurus."
4,Very nice.,These earrings are very nice. They have long post that the clasps screw on so they are very secure. You will be very happy to receive them.
1,Biology,I just say it was the first time of mine. I just want to know about biology and hope you consider it.
3,Inventively written,"1st of all, It isn't a ""Carnival"" that the character escapes to. It is a permanent amusement park constructed on a pier connected to the boardwalk. You'd have to see a NJ boardwalk to understand. This may sound trivial, but there is a major difference between a carnival and a park. A carnival travels, A park doesn't move. Anyway, the movie is touching and sensitive, no pun intended. Robert Hays shows he can do more than comedy. his character is believable and sensitive. Catherine Bellar has one of her best performances as Jenny. The boardwalk makes a great backdrop for the story, and a neat look at Summer at the Jersey shore in the 80's. I have a biased opinion on this film because I actually worked at the park where it was filmed, for 26 years. I am also in the crowd scenes...........lol. This doesn't mean that the movie isn't worth watching, it's a borderline chick flick, check it out."
4,This was a Gift,My brother and I watched Combat as kids - this gift was for him - he really liked this -
5,Fascinating stuff,Very interesting production featuring lots of information I haven't encountered before. Surely Churchhill and Thompson were meant to come together at this perilous time! Good production values. First rate!
2,Not interesting!,"Winston Churchill is an historical figure who I admire greatly. I have read his books and books written about him during various periods of his life. In that regard, ""Churchill: A Life"" written by Sir Martin Gilbert is one of the best and most informative. When I saw this advertised on Amazon.com, I was very interested in learning about Mr. Churchill from another perspective, that being from the man who was assigned to guard him. I expected to discover new insights about Sir Winston, instead I was presented with anecdotes and casual observations. It was a waste of my time."
2,A little disappointing,"This documentary shows me I've become spoiled with modern production value, but you can't blame the producers here. This thing is really old. It is mildly interesting for Churchill buffs, has some neat film cuts, but it is otherwise very over-dramaticized and superficial. Not a real historical record, I learned very little about Churchill and the time period. I'm sorry I bought it."
1,Totally Bogus,"This isn't even a good ripoff of the original film. It lacks any real drama, any characters even remotely interesting, and indeed any real reason for having been made -- except to take a great story, dumb it down for the MTV generation and throw in an obnoxious soundtrack with a lot of fast edits.This movie should be permanently grounded."
1,Stupid and predictable,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The audio quality is terrible. The voices were so quiet I had to crank my reciever to the max and it was still horrible. Watching the characters in the movie was painful. They were all total idiots. If I crashed in an airplane I wouldn't want them in my group. A pack of rabid monkeys in a crashed space ship could have made it out of the dessert before they did. I wouldn't watch this movie on tv if it was free, let alone buy the movie."
3,Not Bad,"The acting in this film was pretty good, and so were the special effects. I also thought the story was very good, and the ending was sweet.That said, this good film is somewhat dirtied by a bad screenwriter. The lines were completely dumb, and the characters had to say them seriously.You probably will like this movie anyway, but it could have been great with a better screenplay."
3,music in the movie,"okay...i have come that those of you really listening in this movie will know what you are listening to.For those of you who were sonically intrigued by the scene where Dennis Quaid, Tyrese and others go to find out the real motives of the ""nomads"". The scene is all blue and ""Ian"" is trying to speak the language of these men. There is a tantalizing song playing in the background.IT IS NOT ON THE SCORE.IT IS BY A GROUP CALLED MASSIVE ATTACK and the song is called ANGEL.you won't regret this purchase if you liked the way it was used in the movie."
5,FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX,"THIS WONDERFUL MOVIE LIKE THIS IS A ACTION MOVIE!!!!!!!!THE ACTORS AND ACTRESS ARE WONDERFGUL!!!!THIS SHOULD BE 5 STARS;NOT 4 STARS!!!!!!!I CANT WAIT TILL IT COMES TO DVD WIDSCREEN!!!!!!!!!P.S. DENNIES QUAD,(THE DAY AFTER TRRMORRORW)AND MIRANDA OTTO(THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRIGOLY,1 AND 2)ARE THE BEST!!!!WELL FOR NOW I HAVE TO GO TO THE MOVIE THEATERS AND SEE:HIDE AND SEEK!!"
1,Two hours wasted,"This film falls under my personal category of ""time wasted that you will never get back"". It has the workings to be a good film, but as others have so eloquently stated, there is just too much going on and it is too predictable. If you are just looking for mindless entertainment, you found it. No offense to any of the actors, I feel they did the best job they could with the task they were given."
3,SURVIVOR GOES TO MONGOLA,"This movie isn't even as good at the SURVIVOR series, but would make a great backdrop for a future season. a dozen people are evacuated from an dry oil well and crash in the dessert. Soon they are all at each other's throats as the water starts to dry up and they have no way out except to build a plane from the wreckage. For some reason that description sounds a lot better than what the movie turned out to be. All in all it was a so-so made for TV movie with lackluster performances. You just wanted to punch the plane designer the whole way through."
1,Flight of the Phoneyix,"I was amazed how people could be the hot sunny desert not get sun blisters, run around with their cloths off (ever seen a naked Bedouin on camel back), drink only a pint a day of water and not get cracked lips. Truely super human. I don't think they even got tan. And how did they strap people to the wing of a plane (with wind shields) and not ruin the air flow that keeps a plane aloft? Amazing."
3,Entertaining but don't look for a deep plot,"Not very interesting for the first half of the movie at all. Honestly the characters could have all died and I wouldn't have cared because I hadn't bonded much with them. I did not want Hugh Laurie's character to die because well it's Hugh Laurie. But then it picked up with building the plane and engaged me quite a bit, enough to make up for the beginning. It's an okay movie overall. A decent way to pass the time. I'd recommend it if you're quite bored, otherwise skip it."
3,ok at best but the blu ray looks good.,"This is another argument why classic movies should not be remade. This can't hold a candle in scope or any other factgore to the original movie. The actors are good here but the script and detail is poor compared to the original. THe blu ray looks great though and lets hope the original classic hits blu ray soon. Dennis quad and the rest here do their best but if you've seen the original it's just a pale imitation of that movie. Much like 'fright nights' remake, it can't hold a candle to the original either. This has extras on it though and the photography looks great and the special effects are good too. But; if you've seen the original then this is a big letdown in many ways and it doesn't have the tension of the original either. Still at the cheap price you can get this now it's worth adding to your blu ray collection."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Another pointless remake, Flight of the Phoenix has nothing to recommend it aside from the fact that it's not that bad; there is no reason to watch or purchase it when the better original is also available on DVD."
3,Quaid - 3 stars; Stewart - 4; Book - 5,"While I had a great time in the theater watching the Quaid version of Flight of the Phoenix (I'm a sucker for Quaid & it was a joy to see Hugh Laurie), this movie is much more fragmented and has less character development than the Jimmy Stewart version.Both movies, however, pale in comparison to the book by Elleston Trevor. Darker and more intense than the movies, the first sentence sets the tone: ""The wind had flung the sand thirty thousand feet into the sky above the desert in a blinding cloud from the Niger to the Nile, and somewhere in it was the airplane."" Even if you're reading this book in the middle of the winter or in a torrential downpour of rain, by the time you're half way through it you'll be parched and on the edge of your seat. Plan to go through several bottles of water reading it.Originally released in 1964, the book was reissued in 2004 in mass market paperback."
3,Large mediocre with cheese,"Usually, movies with actors as good as those in Flight of the Phoenix guarantee that the movie will be good. Not so here. The movie is basically sound but it fails to provide real suspense. F-bombs and s-words are dropped like loose change, and there is slight innuendo. The ONLY bright spot is the acting, which cannot be faulted."
3,"Some improvements, some backslides","Basically a comparison with the original:Obviously the effects are better, and overall, I thought the characters were more believable in this than the original - back then, disasters could only seem to happen because of a series of stupid mistakes and/or people. That was definitely improved upon as well as, obviously, the effects; however on the flip, side the storyline did suffer more, particular with the choice of ending which was definitely done better in the original.All that said, overall, it's a generally good disaster movie, without the annoying 'stupid' factor that has prevaded so many of its predecessors."
4,Great Re-make,The original of this film was not a great movie. It was cringe-worthy at times with gross overacting and b-movie music touches. The remake finally did the film justice and was very enjoyable.
4,The Flight of the Phoenix,"A group of air crash survivors are stranded in the Mongolian desert with no chance of rescue. Facing a brutal environment, dwindling resources, and an attack by desert smugglers, they realize their only hope is doing the ""impossible""--building a new plane from the wreckage. This remake was often enjoyable and even uplifting."
2,Alright movie,I got it cause it had Hugh Laurie in it.. watched it like 2 x's and then sold it on Ebay...
2,what????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,and i mean WHAT THE HECK???????the flight of the phoenix isn't the best movie of the year.no really.it has a bad storyline and bad acting.this is the worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Original is Better,"I was looking forward to this film but found it far below the original with Jimmy Stewart. Very little time is spent on the actual construction of the new plane and at the end everyone is still in good makeup with barely a sunburn. If you want to see a great survival film, check out the 1965 version - it is far superior."
4,A GREAT GUY MOVIE,A REALLY GREAT AND SUSPENSE FILLED MOVIE REALLY ENJOYED WATCHING THIS ONE AGAIN... KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT
2,Flight of the Phoenix,Kept skipping because the DVD was loose inside the case. The parts that did not skip over were good though.
2,Boring!,This movie was waste of money! it was boring. I thought it would be a good movie' but i was very wrong.
3,OK remake of classic action flick,"""Flight of the Phoenix"" is a remake of an excellent 1965 action thriller, which starred James Stuart, Richard Attenborough and Hardy Kruger. It tries hard to be its own movie.I don't like remakes. I feel there is enough fresh material out there that remakes are not necessary. That is, of course, a personal assessment.The movie follows the plot of the original. A plane takes off from an oil field and crashes into the desert. The survivors construct a plane out of the debris.The new version suffers from being effects driven. The original succeeded because it was character-driven."
2,"Good Plot , Exaggerated ,Uninspiring Performances","This movie is an absolute disaster. I haven't seen the original but let me tell you no director could possibly put together any worse set of actors for a film. In a land where they're doomed to be roasted to death, they show optimism. They build a plane ,dance aroud to radios that appear from nowhere. There are many loopholes to this plot. It didnt seem that the moderate sized plane that crashed in the desert could carry as much as load as they somehow bought out of it.If you're an intense movie watcher like most are or if you're looking for a good lost nowhere movie please don't buy this. It's good that I borrowed a friend's copy of the dvd. Somehow my friend hasn't seen it.I suggest he put it up for auction somewhere. In any case,this movie's a complete disappointment with very incompetent acting and action."
3,Blah,"I generally like Dennis Quaid, but this movie is just blah. Too slow and predictable. It's good enough to watch if nothing else is on, but that's about it."
1,Why not to buy the full screen edition....,"This movies is one of the best remakes I have ever seen. I waited until the very day it came out so I could run to the store and buy it.For any of you who have seen it in the theaters, and even if you haven't, if you buy the full screen version YOU WILL MISS PARTS!! Parts of this movie that I like the most did not show up on the full screen version. I don't mean editing cuts. I mean that the full screen version cuts the shots off.I personally do not like to buy widescreen movies because I do not have a widescreen television; however, this film is best in widescreen!!!I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO BUY THE WIDESCREEN VERSION OF THIS FILM INSTEAD OF THE FULL SCREEN!!"
2,Da - Da Hello,"This remake of The Flight Of The Phoenix is a mazing one........Or is it?They are a few problems out of this movie.(mayby this clears it out:IT CHANGED MY MIND TO GET THE DVD.)This is the problems:Bad acting,Horribal story,ect."
1,Hated it,None of the characters or their relationships with one another had any substance. The tools and resources available to this group were astounding. There was absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. I disliked it within the first five minutes and can't believe I actually watched the whole thing.
1,see the original,"This sad excuse of a film is a ""cartoon"" version of the original. Skip it and buy the original."
4,"Pay no attention to the original, and this is pretty good.","What's the problem with this version of Flight of the Phoenix? It can't be the original with James Stewart. And that's okay. The problem comes in when everyone tries to compare this version with the original. Quite frankly, nothing can compare with the original, the acting is just too good to be surpassed.So I suggest not comparing to the original, and judging this Flight of the Phoenix on its own grounds. If you do, it's actually a pretty fun, entertaining film. Dennis Quaid plays Dennis Quaid, as usual, and does a good job. Miranda Otto makes things interesting. Giovanni Ribisi as the designer is also quite good.I give it 4 stars."
3,WORTH WATCHING! (3 1/2 STARS),"I never saw the original, so I can't compare them,but I thought this remake was pretty good. It heldmy interest for 2 hours, so it must have been good!The way they did the plane crash was cool. If youhave a good sound system, the bass on this disc, willamaze you ! My whole room was shaking when the planewas loosing control! I enjoyed it! So will you."
4,excellent movie,I had no idea what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. I watched this with my husband and we LOVED it!
2,So you're joking right?,"I hope the film crew was just playing around when they made this one and didn't believe they were making an actual movie.Everything from the script, storyline, to directing feels so staged and corny I honestly found myself laughing during many of the more serious scenes and what little comedy relief there put me on the verge of eternal sleep.Despite this movie losing my attention many times throughout it's length, I managed to at least stay in front of the screen until the end. Honestly the only thing that kept me watching was laughing as this film just became more and more silly as it progressed.Two stars cuz the scenery at least was decent."
2,Barely worth a rental,"After 30 minutes into Flight of the Phoenix, I asked myself, ""Self, when does the action start?"" Upon falling asleep and waking up later into the movie, I asked myself that again...and again. The trailer is incredibly misleading in that it makes this movie look somewhat...well...exciting. It's incredibly sleep-inducing and terribly written. One question: Why is Dennis Quaid trudging through the scorching desert with a winter bomber jacket and full flight regalia? Another question: why remake the original and make it worse? Don't waste your time."
2,"Cheesy A-Team survival, no-drama movie","I wasn't a big fan of this movie, it was mediocre to me. I thought the lines (the dialogue) in this were absolutely terrible, and cliché of other movies. As some of the other reviewers mentioned, there is no substance in any of the characters. You start to not care if they ever survive their ordeal. It lacked character development. The film is boring and far fetched. It was like the A team crashes in the dessert. ""well we have crashed in the desert.... BUT we have a plane engineer on board, fuel, power saws, welders, and the manpower to make a new plane"" This was just a little too cheesy for me. If you must have an emotional tale of survival, involving a plane wreck, with impossible elements, then stick with the movie ""Alive"" at least it really happened and has detailed character development"
2,Beyond Belief,"To each their own, grandson, but the aviation faux pas were so ridiculous that if you know anything about airplanes the movie became silly. Probably not their intention."
1,Get The Original,"Who needs character development when you can have special effects. Besides, character development takes time and requires a little attention span. I suspect the director plays a lot of computer games and is heavily influenced by such great works as Grand Theft Auto."
2,Really disappointing,"What a shame. This book seemed so exciting when I ordered it. But this author doesn't understand musical theatre. He doesn't really know the art form; he just knows a bit about it. So much of the book is so condescending and so dismissive toward a lot of oustanding musicals. And there are so many small factual errors that I have to wonder if he's really seen some of the shows he writes about. Was there no one to proof this book? Did no one reading it know that there is no Oscar for ""best soundtrack""? And in addition to factual errors, Singer also fudges the truth from time to time to support his pre-existing conclusions. He doesn't seem to have much respect for the art form, and from what I can tell from his book jacket bio, he's never worked in the musical theatre, so he has virtually no interesting insights into how musicals work. Though there is a bit of useful info in the book, there are far better books than this. Don't bother."
3,wish it was stronger....,"I liked this one better than the sally hansen extra strength, but I wish it was stronger.You have to keep the creme on for longer than the recommended time for better results. I usually do 15-20 minutes.Also the spatula provided is very small and hard to use."
3,Average Product,"This review may be useful if you have fair skin and dark hair.Jolen does bleach your facial hair but it's messy to make (You have to mix two ingredients).For me it was hard to figure exactly how much to mix. It has a strong smell like any other hair bleach. Plus some minor tingling. You need to keep it on for about 10 minutes. After bleaching redness lasts for about an hour. Hairs stay light for 2 weeks, then the color starts to return little by little."
5,Excellent.,it protects to you totally of rain. It is easy to keep and to transport. It is excellent. It is a great investment cost/value.
3,Not effective for Achilles Tendonitis,"This splint is very lightweight and as comfortable as a product like this can be expected to be. I was able to sleep in it without too much bother. However, it seems to have an angle to it that actually stretches my achilles tendon out too much. You can adjust it to make the angle smaller, but not larger, which is what I would need. I do have to say that the company sent me an e-mail stating that they have a money back guarantee and that I could send it back, but I'm opting to keep it, thinking that if any of us ever injure our ankles, it could serve as a somewhat suitable brace."
4,Very enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book of poetry because the poems are relatively short, easy to read (not loaded with complex imagery and metaphors) and comes from a unique perspective: a male outdoorsman. I recommend this book to those who haven't experienced John Haines and I would buy more from him again in the future."
1,Very bad i cant download the movie,I bought a movie and i cant downloaded it wont let me do the download and u guys charge the movie.
4,One of the better games on the Sega CD,One of the better games on the Sega CD system and one of the few adventure games of its kind for the system.
3,Not Too Bad,"I'm not a big fan of romantic songs in general, but I was a huge NKOTB fan back in the day, so I decided to give this a try. I have to say that I was surprised at how good the CD was. Jordan's orginal songs were ok, but the best part of the CD was his covers. His interpretation of the covers on the CD were surprisingly well done. His voice has developed really well, and now he just needs some direction on choice of songs. I would check this out for a romantic evening."
2,Havn't gottin',I have not recieved this item. I ordered 30 days ago and I had still not received it.
4,must have for JK collectors,"I've been a JK and NKOTB fan since 1989.. of course i'm one of the fans that puts teh FAN in Fanatic. this lastest album is better than the last (the Fix) and very different from his first (give it to you). I love hearing some Old favorites with some new ones and a few of these are on ""the Fix"" also. If your a NK collector like me, its a must have.. if your not that into him and love these old ""love songs"" its a must have. My husband wrinkled his nose at the old classics covered by Jordan, but then my husband just doenst get the JK thing."
5,Another wonderful effort from Jordan,"Anyone who was a New Kid fan will want to get this CD. Even if you're not a Jordan fan, you will WANT THIS CD!! Go get it right now."
4,Remember the 80s?,"Even if you don't remember the 80s this album will let you know what you missed. Jordan's voice has only improved with age, and his soulful renditions of 80s classics like ""Careless Whisper"" and ""Waiting for a girl like you"" combined with several original recordings make Love Songs a CD you need to have in your collection."
5,Jordan Interprets a Love Song Like No Other,"In a season more than abundent with a varity of artists attempting to offer romantic albums, only one makes you feel like he's ever truly been in love. Jordan has always been gifted with a beautiful and unique voice, but age and experience has taught him what others have forgotten to include that is essential for making an album about love... emotion. When Jordan sings ""She's Got a Way"", you feel yourself transported next to him as he conversationally explains just what makes his love perfect for him. Song after song, you don't just hear a good voice singing a pretty song, you're wrapped in a moment. The selection of covers has to include at least one of your favorites and each has an updated touch. Of the new material, my favorites are the unique ""Have You"" and the touching ""No More Tears"". My only complaint is I wanted more!"
3,Can't even hate he does have a voice,"Growing up I was never a fan of the New Kids since they were nothing more than a New Edition clone. As I got older and listened to some of the groups ballads in particular Please Don't Go Girl, If You Go Away and Valentine Girl I realized that the group was talented and could harmonize. Jordan shows his vocals off best on the cover songs Tender Love & Careless Whisper."
3,Muddy Mastering?,"I'm trying to determine if my disc is defective. I highly doubt it but this CD sounds like it was copied from a very poorly encoded low bitrate MP3 file. Every track is very muddy, unclear and shrill. Now, the songs them selves are fantastic, but I can't even come to enjoy them with this horrible mastering job. I HOPE I am a singled out case and that Jordan's CD was released at a normal quality. Even the tracks on here that were on his last release (Fix) sound worse quality. I mean, I'm able to produce CLEARER (not BETTER) songs on a personal PC. Again, this isn't talking about the quality or artistic side of this CD, but the mastering job. Does anyone else experience this? Thanks."
5,Love Songs,"Jordan Knight has done a wonderful job with this one. I only wish this was better promoted. This is an album to sit back with a bottle of wine with the one you love and just relax. You truly see what a talent he is and how much his voice has matured through out the years.""Love songs"" is a beautiful compilation of original and covered songs. Jordan's voice is smooth and sultry and truly makes the covers his own with out compromising the integrity of the original songs. His originals are amazing, they all have classic potential. My personal favorite is ""Have You"", who would not want to be proposed with this song in the background. ""I love you, more than anyone in the world could love you...I'm a better man than I thought I could ever be. I found out the way to have your cake and eat it to, convincing your heart to let me have you"".Get this album, you wont regret it."
5,Simply amazing - so sad and beautiful,"This story can be compared to a beautiful piece of classical music - short and SO moving and to be enjoyed in a fast half hour readI've never read a story with so much emotion packed into so few wordsAt 12 pages or so, it's a must read. Really one of the best short stories that I've ever read"
3,Creative,The creative nature if this book was enjoyable and descriptions made it easy to put myself in the story. The characters were not as developed as I would have likes and the story dragged a bit. It would be best suited do a younger audience- the book is intended for a young audience so I should have passed it bye- great read for the younger readers-
5,Very moving,"There is little plot. There is little character development. But this short story still carries something with it: emotion. The whole piece, from beginning to end, has a melancholic feel to it that truly moves you. It happens so rarely that an author manages to carry so much emotion in so few pages, but Martin manages to do it here very well. It has a different feel than his Ice and Fire books, but any fan of his should seek this story out."
2,Short and Bittersweet,"This story fails to surprise and only just manages to entertain. It paints a mood with vivid texture and provides wonderful descriptions of the setting, but lacks much in the way of character development. There is nothing novel or new about the story -- it plods along pleasantly, but predictably. It lacks the depth and interest of Martin's other work."
4,Quality!,Happy with quality and well priced item.. Wish ID mechanism was more permanent. Recommend for clinical assessment for health care professionals.
5,The Great Dakota Staton at her Peak,"I originally owned this incredible album by singer Dakota Staton on vinyl -- and wore it out. One day a few weeks ago I remembered one of the songs on it and thought it was on a re-issued CD I own. But it wasn't. On researching I found it on Madame FooFoo, which brought back a flood of good memories. To my delight it was re-issued on CD and I immediately bought it. As always, had an excellent Amazon purchase experience. The album really cooks with some fabulously fast scat runs by Dakota. No one else sounds like her -- and this CD captures her at her peak. For the uninitiated jazz vocal lover -- get Dakota into your collection. This is a wonderful album to start with. And there's a real bonus here -- If you love Hammond B3, keyboards are by the incomparably funky Richard ""Groove"" Holmes. Highlights -- A House is Not a Home, Let Me Off Uptown, Let It Be Me."
3,Crises in the Holy Land,"A rather lengthy Hebrew language film with subtitles that traces the emotional growth of female seminary students who encounter crises of empathy, faith, love and compassion. Superior production values place it a cut-above most Israeli films."
1,So predictable and obvious,"Gee - an Israeli movie called ""Secrets"" made by a secular person about an intelligent religious girl in the oh-so-oppressive ultra-orthodox world. How ever could we have guessed that she would go from being a total square to an angry lesbian? The random addition of a sickly non-Jewish woman looking for forgiveness in Tzfat (uh, what?) upped the angsty factor.Please save yourself the time and pseudo-emotional energy and skip this movie."
4,Something different.,"A bit gory at the end, but it held my attention, and the storyline was interesting and not your ordinary love story between two women.."
3,"The secrets, reminds my of movies from back in the 60's","The story line is excellent. The actors do a good job with what they have; however, it reminds me of films from the 60's where gays never have a happy ending."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS FILM!,"So I thought ""wow this has high ratings why don't I rent it?"" ugh after the movie was over...i sat there puzzled to why it had so many high ratings..PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE I DID...and YOUR MONEY!!! Instead rent ""Circumstance"" now that movie is a masterpiece....this on the other was a piece a crap it bored me to tears..."
5,An awsome ride of emotions,The Secrets is a well written and well performed film. I would recommend this film for anyone over 18 who is open minded and who wants to be well versed on other cultures.
5,The Secrets,"My God! this movie really make feel proud of what I am.Thank you Avi Nesher for those wonderful pretty and beauty girlsI really felt in love with them, sorry but i just waiting for the second part it deserve"
2,Another love story gone wrong...,"I'm glad I didn't pay money for this film, having only checked it out at the library. Beautifully acted film; unfortunately, the ending completely negated any value it had for me. I wish filmmakers would stop wasting our time with more bad movies that pair lesbian women with bisexual women, or characters that sacrifice their true love for societal approval, as this film does. Such a tiresome theme. The ending of this film was not only disappointing, but stale and rediculous. I always feel so sad when I watch women give up their true love, for valuing external approval more than their own. What a high price to pay! If you enjoy movies with positive lesbian characters, on the other hand, I recommend 'I Can't Think Straight.' I found this film fun, funny, and thoroughly enjoyable.JT - Tucson, AZ"
5,Awesome,This stuff is great!! It's the only putty that's oil based and can mixed with other oil base putties to fine tune a certain wood color.
5,In the Great Tradition of the New York Dolls,"Living in NYC, I had only known of the the Toilet Boys through gig advertisements. I was inadvertently exposed to them when they opened for Nina Hagen, not too long ago. I was much happier watching their show than Nina Hagen's (who I walked out on). They bring showmanship back to rock with their use of pyro, energy, and their great look. Miss Guy reminds me of Debbie Harry on angel-dust, and I mean that in a good way! The next day I went out and bought their CD. Their music is incredible; high-energy, aggresive, knock 'em out-drag 'em down, rock and roll. They give the current state of rock a good shot in the arm. You know who I'm talking about: Bands who look more like the road crew, and mull about onstage like they were forced out there.I know this sounds more like a show review, but typing just doesn't do any justice to the passion that they play with."
4,Later work from one of the true greats,"The Ennis recording to obtain above all others, even for non-pipers, is RTE's Return From Fingal, mostly recorded in 1940 and 1948; aside from surface noise, the only flaw in these early recordings might be that Seamus displays a certain lack of restraint in displaying his unequalled technical prowess on this supremely complicated musical instrument. It also has a nice selection of recordings from his later days, when he'd been through a lot - car wrecks, heart attacks, and pneumonia coupled with being a serious acoholic, which took away much of the command he showed in his youth. Students of piping of course have much to learn from these recordings anyway, but others may be put out by the occasional squealing or flat chanter note, uncertain timing, and a persistent distortion in his high G. All that aside, on his best tunes this is still marvelous music, very nicely recorded and in good tune, from one of the real greats of the century."
4,Technically great,"I suppose if you were raised with endless single note riffs from the Uilleann pipes you would naturally select Seamus Ennis to play those tunes. His rapid and never failing finger movement certainly grabs our attention.But my vote is with Davy Spillane's lament for Cuchulain in ""Riverdance.That beautiful chordal melody so expertly fingered brings me to tears every time I listen to it.I long for more Uilleann pipe work like that."
3,Should get at least 4 stars...,"but it arrived with dents on the foot. I have turned it so that the dents are not visible, but that's kind of disappointing. (I hate to return things.) It is heavy, so the towels are easy to rip off. I wouldn't call it pretty, but it is functional."
4,2 classic Dollys,"This is a great CD with 2 of Dolly Parton's most classic albums, Jolene and Tennessee Mountain Home. This is the BMG UK version of the CD and it sounds good. This is old country Dolly, not new pop-ish Dolly. Very authentic music here. Especially the Tennessee album is extremely personal and heartfelt. I like having the back-to-back 1973 and 1974 albums on one disc, but why did they but the '74 album first? Highlights include: Jolene, When Someone Wants To Leave, I Will Always Love You, Letter, I Remember, In The Good Old Days, My Tennessee Mountain Home."
5,Proof's Dead,"Proof was just announced dead. now d12 will never be the same. first Bugz, now proof. this is his only solo album out there and should be cherished. he was shot in a bar at 4:30 this mornin. he was the best member after eminem. his lyrics meant something. and now that he's dead, this is all we got.-Tribute to Proof"
5,Awesome,"I brought ""i miss the hip-hop shop"" mix tape, i wasn't that impressed. I saw this CD last year, didn't bother buying it. I brought it last week in the end and my god was it worth every penny, this guy has probably got to be one of the most underated rappers out there. Yes i know he is in D-12, but this guy has skills rivalling if not topping the best in the business, alot of the songs had features from rappers i had never heard of plus i hadn't heard of the most of the producers. This album has been playing around my CD player for weeks now, BUY THIS CD YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!! Peace."
4,Alternate Rap i guess you could call it,As Eminem's right hand man this album was always gonna be half descent but trust me it's more than that. Orignially he wanted to name each track after a famous person or place hence some of the song names. His voice is low and adds emotion to his raps. A top draw album from Big Proof and I look forward to hearing more solo work from him. Good job Proof!!Top 5:Forgive MeKurt KobainSlum Elementz72ed & CentralClap Wit Me
3,"good album, stolen beat","i dig this cd, proof kept some quality in the mainstream hip hop scene, may he rest in peace. but my biggest problem with this album is the last song ""kurt kobain."" the beat is straight up stolen from an atmosphere song (the woman with the tatooed hands) produced by ant, that was released in 2002. sampling is one thing, but ripping beats that have already been done is not cool."
5,Proof got skills,"Way Better then the bizzare cd, Proof finally dropped a solo album its about time, Proofs had skills for years and finally I have something to listen to from D12 thats good since devils night."
4,Proof is searchin' for Jerry Garcia but i have found out who's released the best LP from Shady records this year!,"I wasn't expecting quite much because earlier several mixtapes from Proof disappointed me but as i heard this cd i was freaking out!Lyrically pretty perfect i was impressed by the beats: Almost everyone is bangin',''Forgive'' features the Hook of 50's ''Ghetto Qu'ran'' and that fits perfectly! i thought it would be a D12 style,more poppy album but tracks like ''Black wrist bros'' or ''Kurt Kobain'' proved me wrong.One of the best cds this year.''Sammy da bull'' will be played in clubs all the time and Proof can show his skills without the everlasting skills of Eminem, who's only on one track and hasn't produced even one (thank god!).Big Proof Takeover!!!"
5,"If ya ""Searching"" for an incredible CD, Look no further man.","It is really too damn bad he passed away recently, because after hearing this album in its entirety, I couldn't wait for more from ""Big Proof"". By far the best CD Shady Aftermath put out last summer. Lets face it Bizarre's wasn't bad and Yayo's CD didn't quite pack the punch everyone expected, but this album came outta nowhere as a sleepr and possible contender for album of the year last year.Best cuts:Forgive Me72nd & CentralHigh RollersKurt KobainSammy Da BullRIP BIG PROOF"
3,A Decent Start,"I've been living in Germany for two months now and bought this before I left the US to start learning a little German. The lessons consist of hearing & repeating and short explanations of the rules of grammar. To get the most of this, my advice is to imagine yourself actually using & hearing a word/sentence in conversation.Shortcomings: 1. There are a few typos in the text...which is unprofessional. 2. A few of the terms in the book aren't really used in practice. (I've tried them out and have gotten blank stares.) 3. The explanations of grammar are TOO concise to be especially helpful.You'll end up learning some German, but not enough to ""put it all together."" I ended up buying Na Klar! and am teaching myself from a more comprehensive source (textbook). My German friends approve.All in all, this Living Language package will get you started, but you'll need to do more if you want a two-way dialogue in German."
3,Not the Best Audio Language Teacher,"Of the purely audio language learning systems I have used Living Language and Pimsleur. (Rosetta Stone, which I have also used, is computer-based). Of the two audio systems, Pimsleur is the most effective at building up the ability to speak. This is mostly a matter of approach -- Pimsleur builds from very simple questions and answers up to beginner conversational abilities; Living Language is focused on memorization of words and drills.If you are taking a language course with a human instructor, Living Language provides some good supplementary practice and drills. But, if you want to learn to speak, Pimsleur is the right choice."
1,Warning about the vendor,"I gave one star but really should have given zero because I can't give a good evaluation - I have yet to receive the order I made over six weeks ago, just an email notifying me that they were out of stock. Be warned that just because the CD is advertised as ""available"" for purchase, it is not necessarily ""available"" for you to actually receive.I wouldn't have written this except for the fact that there is a separate entry in Amazon for other copies of this CD sold by vendors other than inandoutrecords. My advice - buy a copy from a different seller."
5,A must have for any quilter!,I have used this many many times while making my quilt blocks. It is extremely helpful in matching up many pieces to sew together and makes it so much easier to get that quarter inch seam allowance. As any quilter (beginner or advanced or anywhere in between) will tell you accuracy in stitching makes the quilt blocks go together so much easier!
4,charm,The charm was shipped on time. This charm was a gift for my daughter. It was a very nice charm.
2,Small Mug,Woods of Windsor Shaving Mug for Gentlemen with Soap BarI was so excited to receive this mug for my husband. When it arrived I was very disapointed. The opening of the mug is so small. The mug should have a larger opening for ALL types of shaving soap to fit inside.Too Bad
4,Awesome with som reservations,"Pros* Easy to install and sync etc.,* Quality is pretty good comparing what I used before (Moto)* Not overly expensive* Power is good and can talk for long hours without chargingCons* hurts little in your ear if you have it for extended amount of time."
1,Terrible Gas can Spout,I have to agree with the other 1 star review. I would give this zero stars if I could. These things are difficult to use and break easily. Never buy one and don't buy a gas can that comes with one.
1,Difficult to impossible to use,What a piece of junk! NEVER BUY ONE OF THESE ANYWHERE!!! You'll end up with more gas on your hands than in the tank messing with the frustrating locking spout.
1,Wasn't expecting much but got even less,"I wasn't looking for a good walking shoe, just a specific ""look"" (surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers). Since newer reviews seemed generally positive, I thought I would take a shot. Unfortunately, these aren't acceptable even for light use. Very tight and feel like cardboard. Sending them back."
5,Fighting Ships is worth your time.,"I am rating this book for what it is...a guide to specific ship designs. Turnbull is the premier popular historian of Japanese and Korean military history. This book is excellent when combined with Turnbull's other works, including ""Samurai Invasion"" and ""The Samurai, A Military History.""Japan's Korean War experience at the beginning of the 17th century is an eerie foretaste of America's experience in the 20th century. This book is an invaluable addition to the library of any student of the era, and the maps, pictures and diagrams make Turnbull's other works come to life."
2,Doesn't work in my HP color laser printer,"Sticks to the belt and jams in my color printer, otherwise very nice paper. Probably OK for use with an inkjet."
2,Sub-par,"This book was disappointing. From the ho-hum characters to the deus ex machina finale, this book just doesn't have very much to recommend it. It is not unusual or above average as I have come to expect from reading some of Barnes' other work, and I don't have time to waste on average science fiction. Fans coming from the Meme Wars timeline will not find here the same level of quality that series offered."
4,Read this before you get on the plane.,"A lot of people assume innocently, that the Medjugorje aparitions have been approved by the Vatican. They have not and this book explains why. Michael Davies shows that the aparitions are nothing but a horrible hoax. Before you go on that expensive piligrimage read this book."
4,What an S.O.B.,"The book was very enlightening and informative. It shows what a truly S.O.B. Jackson was. I agree with the authors that at the very least Jackson should have been brought up on charges of insubordination. After reading the book you will understand why so many Native Americans refuse to take or to use a $20 bill with Jackson's picture on it. His treatment of Native Americans was abhorrent as were so many other American leaders of his time. Finally, after you read this book I'm going to guess you will have a whole different slant on the meanings of manifeest destiny and divine providence.The only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars is that I was hoping for more to be written on Jackson and less on the other scofflaws of this era. Overall, the book was an enjoyable read."
2,Great Ideas -- Disappointing Book,"As a firm believer in educational reform, the need for standards, and the virtues of choice, I eagerly awaited this book. Unfortunately, it is a disappointment. While Kearns and Harvey cover the basic ground, their work lacks detail, rigor, and true insight. The book should have covered less and covered it better. The strength of the book is its diagnosis of the current situation.If you're interested in a better education reform book, I would recommend Hirsch's ""The Schools We Need and Why We Don't Have Them"" or Harvey's ""It Takes a City.""I'd like to be more positive, but the book is mediocre at best."
3,"good for still, OK for video - pans pretty smoothly","I like the measurements on this tripod. It would be useful for people doing stitch panoramas who want to take a photo every 15 degrees for example. The panning motion is quite smooth spinning around, however for panning up and down not so much, so don't expect to do much video that requires vertical pans.Not the best head for travel because the handles stick out pretty far.Overall a solid tripod head and not too expensive. I think the bubble level popped out once or twice on me so you might want to glue that in there."
4,Good Transaction,I am not the photography end user of this product. I purchased as a gift. The photographer seemed pleased. Amazon handled my order with their usual proficiency.
4,Met my needs very well,"To start ... I'm not a tripod head enthusiast, just an amateur user who's only prior experience is with a cheap Ambico version.With that out of the way, I found this product met my expectations for a head that cost twice as much as my original tripod.It is fairly stable - the knobs hold my camera in place well, and the three controls give me good flexibility in maneuvering the camera as needed. However, the knobs are definitely twiddly and not as generously proportioned as the 808RC4.However, this does take up much less space and is much lighter, both of which weighed heavily in my decision to choose it. As experienced tripod reviewers say - the best tripod is the one that you have available - and weight was a huge consideration for me.I found the quick release plate to work pretty well too.I bought this along with the 190XPROB - at a bundle discount (currently $217 from Amazon).You might want to check out my more detailed review on how that bundle works out for me."
3,jerky,"I expected a smoother operation from a pan-tilt head like this. However, the quick release worked fairly well with the exception of when the lock-open was triggered it made getting the plate back in less intuitive. I do like the manfrotto quick-release system a little better than gitzo because it allows tightening of the plate with one simple operation, rather than screwing in a pressure plate. For now i'll be using the gitzo ball-head because it's a better fit for me (i.e., smoother operation, smaller and more portable)."
4,Good photography head,We have this same head at our office and I bought it because of that at home. There are better heads but this one is solid and had the built in RC2 plate. It easily holds my 7D (dual battery grip) and 50mm -- 100-400 lens combination.
5,Excellent product!,I bought this a while ago to replace a relatively cheap tilt/pan head that came on my tripod. This is a fantastic head. Everything works well and it is clearly very well made. Better functionality than my previous head and much better build quality. The price is not unreasonable and the quality is top notch. Only problem that I have with it is that it does not fold up as small as what I had before but it is in every other respect vastly superior.
4,it does the job,"it's a good pan head, but the plate doesn't lock in perfectly, I have to twist the camera everytime i want to lock it into this head. anyway, it's just minor adjustment, still fine."
3,Sticky & Jerky Panning & Tilting,"Excessive static friction in the bearings for tilt and pan make smooth panning, tilting and accurate positioning difficult. I am returning this head."
4,Tripod heads!,"I have found the Manfrotto 804RC2 head to be an excellent Pan Tilt Head, it gives me the best performance and control for for my photographic needs at a very reasonable price. No need to spend hundreds of dollars for one when you can get this one for around $80. The 804RC2 is an upgrade over the older model and is designed for and works very well with the Carbon Fiber Tripods"
4,Better than average pan tilt head,"I purchased this head to help out with landscape photographs, as I find ball heads too tedious to align properly. The head is lightweight, travels well and the three different axis controls lock securely with the handles. The only complaint I have is that it's difficult to make finite adjustments. For my burgeoning interest in landscape photography, my next purchase will likely be a gear head mount. Until then, the 804RC2 will work just fine"
3,"Seems solid, but has some design flaws","This tripod head seems like a pretty solid mount, especially as an upgrade from the 391RC2. It locks down quickly and easily, and I don't have any reason to worry.But it seems like there's a pretty severe issue that isn't made clear in the description. The head can only tilt up 30. I really can't see why they've engineered it this way, it seems like a minor modification to the stop would allow much more tilt.This means that the camera cannot be easily pointed at, say, birds in the top of a tree. It also means the head cannot be folded so that the adjustment knobs are out of the way. They're always sticking out, which makes it hard to fit in a tripod bag."
1,Not Good,"Moving from the old 3030, I was hoping for something lighter. After trying to use the 804 for about 5 minutes, it became apparent that this is not a piece of equipment that is up to Manfrotto's quality standard. Operation is sticky, making it very difficult to accurately position where you want. I returned it and got the 808rc4 which is heavier but much smoother and easier to control. I actually preferred the quick release plate on the 804 over the 808. It is smaller and has a D ring for tightening. The plate on the 808 is overkill, too big unless you have a large camera body, but it works."
3,A couple of chapters of basketball history ... done but with a glaring (to me) gap,"The Harlem Renaissance as a movement is a very broad topic and mixing basketball into the historical timeline is very appropriate, but both topics could be covered in books of their own. I am just wondering why the first African American in the NBA, ""Sweetwater"" Clifton, is not mentioned once. He played for the Harlem Rens, then the Globetrotters and, in 1950, was signed to a contract with the NBA, playing for the New York Knicks.I was sorry not to see him mentioned in this book I bought for my 13 year old basketball loving son. I just seemed like a very big gap in a book titled On The Shoulders of Giants."
2,HEADS UP...,"this book only covers part of the O.T., and not the N.T. at all. I might have missed that in the escription but it sure took me by surprise. What I have read is good. IMHO not worth the cost x 3 to get it ALL"
1,Jane Fonda Colection: Fun House Fitness-The Swamp Stomp & The Fun House Funk,"This is not at all what I thought it was, I need return it, it was not good at all"
3,Not what I expected,"I have always admired Jane Fonda and have most of her exercise videos. I thought this one was a git-down type for adults, but it's for kids. I may not have read up on it enough on your website, but then again I don't remember that much of a description for it. I'm stuck with it, and not sure what to do with it. Our grandkids are older than its target group."
5,"So 1990, but fun!","I was a big Fun House fan as a kid & we had the Fun House Funk, one of the two workouts on this DVD, on tape. When I saw this at the library, I had to check it out just for old time's sake. My almost 4 year old actually loved it & exercises right along with it. It's from 1990, so that keeps me laughing, but I've decided to get up & exercise along with her. There are clips from the show Fun House on each workout program. The Swamp Stomp, which I wasn't previously familiar with, is a workout routine geared toward children where you're moving around like a variety of animals would. My child really loves that one. Various people come out dressed like animals & although I think some of them look really goofy, my daughter enjoys it. The Fun House Funk is more like a standard workout program geared towards tweens & teens."
5,Definately 4 kids n teens!,This is definately kid friendly...Great buy for a family with kids who loves tv exercise!
2,Bad Economics,"The book is disappointing as it uses flawed arithmetics. The author views economics as a zero-sum game. He confuses competitiveness among corporations as being the same as amongst countries. The book seems intellectually rigorous but any serious economist will tell you it is full of fallacies. One gets a better idea of international economics by reading Pop Internationalism by Paul Krugman, one of the most brilliant younger economist."
1,Seriously Flawed,"The assertions in this book remain just that. Thurow has once again produced a populist book that lacks any academic foundation. Playing on current trends and American paranoia this book presents distorted facts and hence distorted conclusions- ignoring some of the most basic ideas of free trade, such as mutual gains. Read Krugman, Obstfeld or Rogoff, but please don't read this."
4,Good analysis of emerging global issues,"Lester has done a good job of identifying the issues that face us both now and in the future, especially in the area of globalization and the global economy. Where his arguments break down are in the solutions. Lester tends to prescribe government intervention to resolve the issues, rather than letting the free market play a role in resolving the issues. My impression is that he believes that both the Europeans and the Japanese have superior systems, and that we should copy what they have been doing, which involves a lot of government money and buraucracy. The book is certainly good reading up to the last few chapters, when the government solutions start to creep in. Contrast Thurow to Peter Drucker, who depends more on better business practices to enable companies to compete globally"
3,Meh..,No immediately noticeable results. Roaches are supposed to be attracted to it- but not from what I see. Ive had the product for over a month and still see the same amount of roaches.
3,"Adequate tastes, adequate recipes","I borrowed this book for a dinner party, and while I won't buy my own, there are a few recipes I'd make again -- a suitable description of my overall happiness with it.Good things: the recipes are accessible to novice cooks (like me), minor errors and amateurish skills are (mostly) ok, and we were able to pull off all of the recipes we tried.Bad things: there are a lot of gotchas, like assumptions about tools that novice cooks may not have; the portion measurements were regularly off (every dish we made didn't come out to the right amount -- too many, too few...); the ratings of easy to hard seem way off.Overall, some hits (pronto puff pizzas, salmon/trout roulade) and some misses (cheese-filled mushrooms) with the crowd, and I wouldn't rush to make any of them again."
3,"Well shaped, but deforms easily","The product fits well, but the material is too thin to retain it's shape well and not pliable enough to stay in contact with the floorboards. I was expecting a heavier, more rubbery material that would conform well to the floorboards. The plastic and light weight of these liners allow them to shift position on the floor, then retain a deformed shaped as a result.Seems like they should last a long time. Would be great if automakers and the floor liner companies would come up with an attachment system to standardize on (velcro???). floormats/liners moving around has been an age old problem."
5,A great item!,A classic show that everyone should own! I got the product very quickly and in excellent condition! Amazon rocks!
1,Obviously never been there,"This is a cheesy romance novel that uses St Kilda and every stereotype Harper could find to tell a lame story in an overwritten muddy style. It was trully painful reading. Sorry, I wanted to like it, but simply couldn't. It is unbelievable she would write a novel taking place in Scotland having never visited there. James Michener spent many years traveling through Scotland and still didn't feel he understood this country well enough to write about it. Karen Harper obviously read a travel guide and felt that was plenty. Painful! Hey, wait, Michener is still in print and Harper isn't. Wonder if that means anything?"
5,the best season to date of walker texas ranger,In this season you see country superstar Lila Mccann as kellie wyman. You see cordell become a principal after a principal after his friend is murdered. this season has alot of action. The children of halloween is the only episode that I didn't like. I would give this season a full 5 stars.
3,3 of Chuck's weaker roles,"Logans war was entertaining to a degree. Its basically a guy norris raised after his fam got killed. Then him and norris face off with the mob. Kinda over the top but had alot of action.Presidents man was eh ok.. norris and his daughter get a guy out of jail, train him and he becomes the next presidents man. Norris joins him and saves the day.Presidents man 2, had a diff president, a diff presidents man..no explanation why? Was this supposed to be the same guy? Was he replaced? Who knows..These were norris's weaker roles. His later films, he looked really bored. And his asian daughter, while hot, was really annoying and a bit**. Esp in president 2. I give this set 3 stars,only because of logans war being good. The president man movies really wernt that great. Im a norris fan, but those 2 movies bored me. See them if you must.."
3,TV Movies,"These three films are okay. Would watch them again? No I wouldn't watch them a second time. They were not really Chuck Norris films, he plays a secondery role in these. He is kind of like the mentor role..."
3,I was somewhat entertained...,"Three star rating for this piece of semi-humorous 70's sleaze. According to Amazon's rating system three stars = ""It's okay"", which is exactly how I feel about it.The print looks good enough for this type of product, although it's fullscreen so the presentation could be better in my opinion.The real reason I bought this is Uschi Digard. And have no fear, she shows off the two things shes best known for in this seedy flick. The ""plot"" also involves dirty minded truckers which I personally find amusing.Dont pay too much for it and you should be satisfied..."
2,Very disappointing!!!,All the major sex scenes have been edited out!!!! Buyers be ware you are not getting the original movies as they were when they were released!!!
5,Fantasia IC Tea Shampoo,"My wife and I have used this shampoo for quite a number of years. Now, I can no longer find it locally at any store here in Springfield, Mo., but thankfully can buy it thru Amazon. Our Home Health Aid says it's the best she has found any client to have."
3,Meh... it's OK I guess...,"Not sure about all these 5 star reviews. I ordered this shampoo only because SUAVE reformulated their DAILY CLARIFYING shampoo which I have used forever. Now, it's not near as good as it used to be, as you can see from the many reviews on Amazon. This stuff is average. It doesn't really lather well at all. It does smell like sweet bubble gum. I have to wash my hair with it 2x in a row to get my hair to lather and feel clean. These other reviews would have you believe this is some sort of miracle product that removes oil and cures dandruff. Hardly. That said, it's cheap for a SALON brand (though my SUAVE was only a couple bucks). I probably won't buy it again after this bottle is gone."
4,FANTASIA SHAMPOO IC tea 16oz,This shampoo leaves hair clean with no residue and gives hair a nice feel and shine
4,great shampoo,"Really like this shampoo. They stopped selling it where we could purchsae, so we went on line. Have used it for 20 years and it keeps our hair looking great!"
5,"The Fearmakers(1958)It shouldn't be called a RedScare Movie,since the RedScare was Legimate.","Great movie NetflixInstant had that I watched,I appreciate it's message,the term RedScare is a misnomer,It is a term coined by Liberals and dupes to discredit McCarthy/McCarthyism and Democrat Senator Dies(Who Sat on HUAC,Another Democrat Scoop Jackson was Anti-Red,the whole nonsense that Republicans were and are Redbaiters should be noted that we were just stronger,and with the exception of Sen.Dies and Scoop and some other Brave True Democrats.Since McCarthy did not chair Huac.)The movie brings home the point that there was a Threat(Still is,especially in the form of Liberalism and Enviromentalists.)and the acting and plot are superb,This is better than the movie Seven Days In May,because it shows the lengths fellow-travelers then and Now and their Enablers are willing to go.Instead of RedScare it should be a Movie for a Conservative or Thinking American should see."
3,Joe Pass was great,"I heard one song from this album on Pandora and my husband loved it. I got album for him for Christmas. The rest of the songs are not like the one we heard and although I really like Joe Pass, the rest of the songs were not what I expected to get. I was a little disappointed. You should probably review thr whole album before buying."
5,biographical data and artistry summary,"Joe Pass (born Joseph Anthony Passalaqua)b.January 13, 1929 - d.May 23, 1994)jazz guitarist; His extensive use of walking basslines, melodic counterpoint during improvisation, and use of a chord-melody style of play opened up new possibilities for jazz guitar and had a profound influence on future guitarists.RIP[...]"
3,Dare To Connect,"I didn't think ""Dare TO Connect"" was quite as good as Susan Jeffers' book ""Feel the Fear"". But she gave me many ideas to think about in communicating with others. The main idea of the book is to understand yourself and reach out to others. It is also a spiritual book about our Higher Self. It has given me a better understanding of how to treat others as part of God's plan. We are all here for each other."
4,Build Vocabulary,"I read about this book in a parenting magazine and picked it up because it was inexpensive. Although the illustrations can not compete with some of the exquisite books available to our children, my 20 month old daughter memorized with joy and gusto this simple story. In fact, it started her using adjectives in her own speech. The Bright and Early books are successful because the simple meter and clear pictures are pure delight to children. Get it out of the library and when your child is as obsessed as mine became, you can order your own copy from Amazon!"
4,=D!,"This book is really cute. How a bear wants a new hat but cant find one. So the store clerk comes out with a whole bunch of hat's, but the bear doesn't like them. Then the bear ends up picking his old hat."
5,Old Hat New Hat,Great addition to the little ones collection of Berenstain Bears books. She loves watching the cartoons and reading the books.
5,"My childhood favorite... and my daughter's, too!","When I was searching for new books for my 18m old daughter, I came across this favorite from my childhood.When Berenstein bear decides to trade his ""old hat"" for a ""new hat"" he tries many different styles (too big, too small, too flat, too tall). Turns out, his old hat is just right! It's still one of the cutest books ever written.Sometimes, my daughter could care less about books I like, but she chooses this one time and time again."
5,Evergreen classic,My children love this book - all of them from 3 years to 10 years stop to listen if I read it aloud to one of them. It illustrates the concept of 'the grass is always greener on the other side' in a fun and quirky way. One of the first books that my reluctant reader child was willing to read on his own. Every child should have one on his shelf.
5,Old book Still great,A wonderful way to teach adjectives as well as the ultimate lesson that whatever is new and shiny may not be better than what we already have.Rhymes and colors make this appealing to youngsters from a very early age. Highly recommended.
3,alright for the price,"We were going to buy one of the $500+ chairs and instead decided to go with this chair (because it was on sale and we had a coupon). Was much cheaper. . .in price and quality, but saved us money to buy all the other super expensive baby things that we needed for our nursery. The chair and ottoman were very easy to put together. We bought at Babies r Us, cushion is dented badly in back, but still usable. The fabric sucks, and chair probally wont last, but for less than $200 what can you expect. I can buy 2 more chairs for the price of the super expensive one."
1,"Missing Parts, 20 Days Later...","After receiving this glider as a gift, I attempted to assemble it and found that it was missing a few pieces. I emailed Jardine to request replacements and received an email the next day saying that the parts were on the way and that I should allow 2 weeks for delivery. That was on May 9th, I still have yet to receive them (as of May 29th). My twin boys were born on Friday and came home today (Memorial Day) to a nursery with no way for my wife to breastfeed comfortably. I'm not sure what I would rate this chair, BECAUSE WE CAN'T USE IT. 1 star until Jardine figures out how to fix this problem."
1,Looks better than it is,"My husband and I excitedly ordered our entire nursery set on Amazon including this chair, the cherry dresser and Madison Cherry Crib. The crib came with a huge scratch on it, the dresser was okay but this chair is a huge disappointment. First of all the cushion is flattening out but not too bad yet but there's a crack in the back. The wood is severely cracked and I can't imagine it will last for another year. It seems much more cheap than what you could find at a furniture store. The wood almost seems porous and light which would make it prone to cracking. If you're overweight, I don't recommend this chair. Luckily he and I are underweight. I am hugely disappointed with many things I purchased here and our roommate has had the same experience. Many damaged items have been shipped to him too from Amazon. I am convinced the ""happy"" reviews are from people who work at Amazon or the manufacturers."
4,Cherry Glider,"The glider is wonderful. Very comfortable and makes it very easy to feed my baby. My only complaint is the suede covers, I haven't figured out how to clean them and formula can stain."
4,Cherrry Glider and matching Ottoman,"At about 3 months old this glider started squeaking..really loudly. Then a screw fell out, then another screw, then another. Now both of the arms have popped out!! I am too scared to rock my 6 month old in this chair. If it were to collapse, like it sounds like it will, he could be seriously injured. I am contacting babiesrus to consider a recall.Please do not buy this Chair!! It is UNSAFE!!!"
1,"Seems great at first, but just wait....","My glider is 4 months old, and at first I loved it. But after just these 4 months of use, the seat cushion is flattened to the base, and it creaks like a rusty hinge in the wind! I can hardly put my baby to sleep in it, and although it looks nice, my lower back aches if I sit in it for too long. This rapid deterioration of condition is very disappointing."
1,Do Not Purchase,"My husband and I purchased this glider after trying out all (literally) of the brands in the marketplace. We wanted something midrange that was comfortable and looked nice and thought this was the perfect fit.That was until we got home and assembled it. Immediately after assembling it when we sat down to try it out...the chair and ottoman were squeaky. I was shocked. The bars on the back of the chair are so thin and not secure and so they were terribly squeaky.We debated crazy gluing the rods in the back into their respective holes so they wouldn't squeak but then opted to disassemble the glider and return it because we figured if the thing was squeaky on day one, it was just going to get worse.Our search continues :("
5,Simply the Best!,"This book is the best introduction to the theories of Schenker that I've ever read. It is simple, concise and easy to understand. It also serves as a good advanced musicianship book dealing with species counterpoint. It deals with music from the Renaissance to the twentieth-century which is quite refreshing. Recommended."
3,Could have been better.,I bought this because I read Dragon's Mistress first and liked it. I was disapointed in this story. I didn't like the heroine. He should have kicked her to the curb. I won't be continuing with this series.
4,Price is Right!,"I just finished the book and am looking to read another one by the author. It had just the right blend of spice, romance and action"
3,It is ok,The story was an ok read for me it started out REALLY slow .Picked up some . I am not saying not to read this one but you will wonder for the first few chapters why you are reading it but hang in there it is not one of the best I have read but not the worst either.
4,Price of Pleasure,"it wasn't what I expected, but the story line was good. I really liked it. It could have been a little longer but then I guess I could purchase the following books. I would recommend it to my friends to read."
5,Buy this book!,"If you collect paper dolls, or just like them, I suggest you snatch this one up. It's one of the newest additions to my collection, and is already one of my favorite of the Tierney paper doll families. The entire family comes in swimsuits: grandparents Walter and JoAnn; Walter's sons Patrick and Brad; JoAnn's children Scott and Shannon; Patrick's smiling wife Kathy; their absolutely darling children--Bridget has Shirley Temple curls, Deirdre has a fashionable bob-cut, and Brandon has his uncle's good looks. They have fashionable costumes for all occasions: shopping, winter outings, and, of course, Shannon's afternoon wedding! On the last plate is Shannon's beautiful wedding dress. Georgeous dress, in the 30's fashion. I won't spoil it though--you have to see it for yourself! A must-buy!"
5,American Family of the 1930's Paper Dolls,"I thought the paper dolls showed the unique clothing of that time period, I am a avid collector of paper dolls and i am glad i had a chance to add this to my collection. I have also bought other Tom Tierney paper doll which were exqisite as well"
1,Worthless!!!,"The install went very smoothly. It is an exact fit for the original latch in my 1993 F-150. However, that's where the good ended. I put it all together, and the first time I tried to latch the window it broke. Awful product, stay away! I know it's just plastic, but the original plastic latch lasted almost 20 years. I ordered this productC.R. LAURENCE DVL2 CRL Replacement Metal Backslider Latchand although the holes didn't line up exactly the latch is made of metal and probably won't break for a long time."
1,"REAR WINDOW LATCH, OLDER DODGE","Don't buy. The installation is straight forward, but the first time I tried to put it in the lock position the main latch broke in two pieces."
4,A woman's point of view,"In this book, Baldwin touches upon many evil social traditions and practices, cruelties meted upon women by other women wishing to remain in the good books of the all-powerful patriarchs. Some remain to-date, and some have thankfully almost disappeared. WTBR is a reminder then, that wars are fought on women's bodies, whether they be the overt physical brutalities that occurred during partition, or the subliminal cruelties of forcing women to live life on tenterhooks and jostle for power as subservient, dependent daughters, sisters and wives.Recommended."
3,3 star!,I came across this book quite by accident! I loved the cover.......and though one should not judge a book by its cover.....I was pleasently surprised.. for the most part...thought there were times where I had to skim past some rather dull momnets...but all in all....not a bad read.
2,Stylistic Weakness,"I think that this novel would have been greatly improved by reduction from 500 - plus pages to 300 or fewer. I appreciate that the author is trying to convey both the political background to the Partition, and the treatment of women in a patriarchal society, as well as telling the story of certain individuals. However, I often found the long-winded narrative tedious,and the references to a multitude of named characters highly confusing. Unlike many other Indian novels I've read, this one did not capture my imagination. Characters were not realized in depth, atmosphere was lacking, and plot was flat. It doesn't begin to compare with Arundhati Roy's ""The God of Small Things"", a novel that stayed in my mind for weeks."
4,"Real; evoking memories, a Sikh family depicted very well","The lives, aspirations, compromises, hypocracy, nobility of the many people is depicted in a lush manner. The culture, particularly of the Sikhs from the Rawalpindi area, during the pre-1947 partition days is narrated very well. The Sikh woman's point of view, raised in a joint-family, dowry-burdened context of India, very rare to find in English literature, is a treat.My one peeve is that the novel gets lost in itself near the end. The self-pity gets to be a bit suffocating, yet the author, bravely, does not succumb to a pat cliche end.The choice of vernacular lends the honesty to the landscape."
5,A huge story poetically told,"""What the Body Remembers"" is the story of how India was broken apart into India, West and East Pakistan to satisfy the demands for sanctuary and autonomy by its different religious factions. This epic story unfolds through the story of Roop, the second wife to an older, wealthy Sikh who has spent his government career under British rule. The warring family represents in microcosm the tumult tearing India apart as she fights to survive and grow into independence from British rule. The struggle of new wife against old is the struggle of women within India, striving for dignity and independence in a system that protects them as property.This is a powerful story told in a stirring and poetic voice. The more you learn and care about its central characters, the better you understand the complex forces tearing India apart. Strongly recommended."
3,What the body remebers,"A little too verbose. Difficult to get through the first 1/4 of book. However, well written, historically interesting."
1,Awful! Don't waste your money on this for infants,"My 6 mo old loves your baby can read dvds. They are great and I wish they had some dvds with emphasis on numbers, too (Your baby can count??). In the market for a learning dvd on numbers, I stumbled upon baby bumblebee numbers dvd. AWFUL. It isto sooooooooo slow (as in drawn-out speaking slow...so tortuous), boring, not entertaining. First, the music is very drawn out. Even the people speaking in the video speak verg monotonic. And the singing? Gosh, awful singing! Wish they can spice it up with more upbeat people or use music that's catchy.Even though my child is only 6 mo, she knows which DVD sucks (looks elsewhere, wiggles out of her bumbo) and which is more entertaining (sits in her Bumbo, eyes glued to the your baby can read dvds). I am no spokesperson for YBCR nor do I absolutely love their products but the YBCR songs are very catchy, entertaining, and thus, keep your child's attention longer for the learning to take place."
4,This is my favorite sencha green tea,This is my favorite sencha green tea and is as good a sencha as I have found anywhere - a highly recommend
3,massage table,"received item in time frame quoted and for correct price. I was not happy with the stated quality of product. I will keep and use but it seems a little ""flimsy"". Master massage monroe 29"" salon size massage table by master massage."
5,Good solid table,"Just received this table and was impressed with the quality overall. I'm a big guy, 270lb, and this table holds me well with no squeaking, creaking or shaking. It's very solid and stable. I liked everything about it except the cover. It feels a little stiff rather than soft an supple. It's OK with some nice sheets or a cover on it."
4,The Perfect Gift for Each Other!,"The massage table technology provided with this lower end massage table is amazing - purchased for my wife of course, it is oversized to handle me (the husband) as well. The extension pillow, padding and adjustable height features makes it feel like a professional massage table. Comfortable, easy to set up, light - portable indeed. And finally, it is nice looking as well. One of the best purchases I've made for our household."
2,not what I thought it would be,"This book focused on building figures from scatch, adjusting poses on existing kit figures, assembly, and painting. I was most interested in the subject of painting but I found that the information was too little and of insufficient detail to be of any real help. Much better books on the subject include: How to Paint Realistic Military Figures by Lynn Kessler, and How to Build Dioramas by Sheperd Paine.Lee"
3,A Little Too General,"I found this book a little too general, for my taste. The most useful part are the scale diagrams of human proportions towards the front of the book. I like the pictures of other people's work--that's where the figure modeler can learn the most. I wish they had a few more close-up photos of how to sculpt different materials: cotton, skin, wool, leather, wood, metal. I don't know about every book out there, but my copy is printed rather off-register and that seriously limits the photographic fidelity."
3,Errors,"I had high hopes for the book... but...There are some nice projects in the book, but as I attempt to load the programs into my stamp2 I note that many have errors. Most of them are minor. They used the wrong symbol for comments. Easy to fix, just change and the stamp program points them out to you. But...There were a couple of projects that I REALLY wanted to do, like the balloon telemetry device. Turns out the code is NOT for a stamp2.. it is for a stamp 1. As I understand it, the code is completely different. Another program wouldn't load either.. I haven't figured out why yet.. but I suspect it is the same problem.Why do so many books or magazine articles have errors. Why risk spending the money on all the parts when it may well not work due to errors. Could authors please triple check!?The book may still be worth it in that there are some fun prjects that DO seem to have good code. But.. are the parts diagrams right?"
3,"Nice ideas, but a terrible read...","This book has a lot of great ideas, but is littered with typos. It's almost as if the book was retyped by the publisher and never re-checked.Also, the book is missing the Appendixes the author refers to.If you can get past the typos, the book is ok. I didn't look at the CD."
2,"Not for me, probably not for you.","In my opinion this book is poorly written, unorganized and difficult to understand. There are grammatical errors, discussions that refer to unprinted schematics, and numerous typos. If you are a Stamp expert, I guess this book would be of great value for the schematics alone, but for anyone trying to grasp advanced basic stamp concepts, leave this book on the shelf."
1,One Word...,"McGraw-Hill.Maybe that counts as two words? How can one publisher have such a lock on this kind of material, and continue to produce such horrible books? For as far back as I can personally remember, these guys have put out pure [...] - books rife with errors, books that are pretty much useless (several of their robotics titles on my shelf are laughably horrid) Even their best book ever (in my opinion) Practical Electronics For Inventors by Paul Scherz had all sorts of errors - stuff that was maddening to me and my students for years. I haven't decided if I should risk the money on the new edition of that book or not...I really worry that while they may have fixed the old errors, they very well may have introduced a whole slew of new ones.Anyone know how they can keep doing this? Because we keep buying their books, don't we? Just say no, and maybe, just maybe they'll get the message. And maybe other publishers can step in even more.A guy can dream, no? :)"
3,"I paid $4 for it, and it is OK for that price, but does not pay more!","The good:Book gives you general idea of what kind of communications can be established with relatively simple connections to basic stamp.The bad:Documentation is poorly written, code is badly explained, schematics also lack explanation and each paragraph in the book feels like it is missing maybe 60% of content?Well, I've paid $4 for this book + free shipping and for that price, it provided me with enough information.Another weird notice - this book is printed on very rough paper! Feels almost like sandpaper, never seen such book!"
4,Stamp Project Books,"Stamp 2 Communications and Control Projects presents a well written book on Basic Stamp 2 projects. The contents focus and building Basic Stamp projects and less on the programming aspect of The Basic Stamp controller. The author however provides ample source code to work from and appears to assume you know at least some basics of programming the Stamp. The book also has a CD with circuit diagrams, images, and source code for the projects in the book.It is a an excellent book on hooking up components with very good explanations. Some of the sections appeal to amateur radio related projects, a real bonus for many."
4,"Bought it for a family member who is a lawyer, heard she keeps it on her desk!",Love poking fun at lawyers ever since a lawyer I hired let my case fall through the cracks and I ended up losing. Sure he was paid off. Lawyers suck!
4,Fantastic Collection,"I have been waiting a a complete english dubbed Transformers: Energon collection and this is it, as before this DVD set was released, the only DVDs of Energon were scattered episodes. This series carries off straight from Transformers: Armada and then follows through into Transformers: Cybertron. It was a mix of CGI and anime-style cel animation. I find the CGI a bit clunky, but it's enjoyable and the storyline continues from episode to episode, rather than unrelated episodes strung together, so I would recommend this series to Transfans and children 10+."
5,Transformers Energon,"I have been a Transformers fan for many years, so when I saw this DVD set online, I knew I had to have it. The episodes are well-written with plenty of action, although the CGI animation used for the Transformers could have been of better quality. Other than that, this is a great addition to the collection of any Transformers fan."
2,where are the transformers?,"THEY COMPLETELY forgot that autobots and decepticons can turn into vehicles, animals, and so on. In this series, we get the morphing subject in only 2 or 3 episodes. I recommend all transformers series except this one. I do give them 2 thumbs up with the CGI / cell shading style, but give us a way better story. And get Transformers prime onto DVD"
2,Most annoying human characters every to disgrace Transformers,"This series might have been OK, but the character Kicker is so freaking annoying that I want to slap him everytime he opens his mouth. What's worse is that everyone in the series tolerates his near constant tantrum-like behavior. The only character that comes close to his level of annoyance is his dad, especially that idiotic laugh of his.With the exception of Megatron (and perhaps Shockblast and Starscream as well), the Transformers themselves are not very well portrayed either.This series is so dull that I have yet to finish it, and I bought it nearly six months ago."
5,About Time!,It's about time this show came out to dvd. Energon is a grate show for that Unicron was in it way more then he was in Armada. RC came back & thanks to that we got are first RC toy. This is a grate show that had one bad thing. KICKER. Other then him this was a grate show. Let's hope Hasbro put's out R.I.D. Next.
5,trippy bliss,I think I like this album better then Heavy Petting their 2nd album (and that's an amazing album).It's similar to the best Incredible String band stuff but very much their own sound.Far out lyrics and inventive twisty melodies sung with a lot of heart.I only wish they made more albums.
4,Arror 506SS1 T50 Staples.,"These staples were a little pricey, but again stainless steel usually are. Must have shipped the same day, as it arrived in three business days via USPS (free shipping), which generally takes longer. Staples penetrate red oak and birch wood easily using only 60 PSI on my pneumatic stapler. Would recommend these to anyone requiring stainless steel staples."
5,Upholstery staples,Durable and strong. I ordered these to go with my new stapler and everything worked great. Would purchase this again.
5,Buy This Book!,"You will have hours of entertaining escapist reading!I don't normally read ""showbiz"" books, but bought this on an impulse, as it had so many great photographs. What was such a nice surprise is that Peter Marshall and his co-author Adrienne Armstrong, are excellent writers. They make the reader feel like he is sitting in a cozy bar with Peter, drink in hand, listening to wonderful tales about the making, and eventual breaking of Hollywood Squares.Peter is refreshingly honest, delightfully candid, yet never disrespectful when discussing the celebrities and contestants who appeared on the show over the years.An added bonus is the CD that comes with the book.I'm a new Peter Marshall fan, who hopes he and his partner write again. Soon."
4,Hollywood Squares,Hysterical! Both the book and the CD. My partner and I enjoyed listening to the CD while traveling and reading the book. What a fun way to remember the old gang of Hollywood Squares.
1,"Author, Author","An interesting document, and ok in the absence of other records of the time. It's too bad that Bill Armstrong (Squares writer, producer, legendary wit, broadly reputed source of Paul Lynde's best lines, and co-author Adrienne Armstrong's ex-husband) didn't live to have his name on a better book about a period he knew and could have described better than anyone. Unfortunately, Bill Armstrong perished, and others published."
5,Love It,All of J. Vernon McGees excerpts of Bible Chapters are excellent. They are easy to read and contain just enough information to learn but not an over abundance to confuse you.
5,Bravo!,This is a great read. A very fast paced adventures romance that keeps you guessing until the very end.This is a must read for anyone in love with adventure reads. You can't go wrong with a shot gun marriage of two spies whose goals are at odds with one another!
4,Comfy,These are pretty comfortable. They aren't the best to look at but they serve their purpose and I would buy again. The pricing is better than other offers out there and very quick shipping.
5,Best Boxer Brief from Wearing Boxer Shorts!!!,"If you were previously a briefs wearer before trying out these Comfortsoft Hanes Boxerbriefs, I can see why you may be fussy about the ""support"" in your underwear products; but for Boxer Shorts wearers wanting to snuggly fit into tighter jeans without the over-supportive feel- or (with boxers) the sudden bagging up, Hanes has found a way to make boxer briefs more boxer than briefs. In addition these are great for saggers, and make your butt more fluently attractive to the ladies without feeling like you're dressed for a WWE wrestling match. The reason why the price is so low is that Hanes is practically the highest selling underwear, t-shirt and clothing brand in the World.However if you're looking for support:Medium Support (Support with comfort):2xistC-IN2Firm Support:Calvin KleinPuma"
2,Not that great,"The whole point of boxer briefs is to offer support and comfort while staying in place. Hanes products only do this for a short period of time before the legs become loose and the boxer briefs turn into regular boxers. I got so tired of this problem that I just bought all boxers because there was no point in wearing boxer briefs anymore. I would recommend boxer briefs made by Old Navy, Under Armour, and Nautica over Hanes. You may pay a bit more, but it's worth it."
3,"Comfortable, but weak","I concur with the other reviewer, the legs on these become loose very quickly. I noticed it after only two washings and one wearing. I'm going to hold on to mine, because they are fine for ""looser"" work clothing, but I'm looking for another brand for ""going out"" wear."
1,Major drop in quality,"These are so disappointing in the drop in quality from my previous experience.I have some comfort band boxer briefs from about 3 years ago and they are still 10 times better than these new ones.These new ones have a narrower waistband and it is actually abrasive on the skin. The support is lacking and the elastic on the legs is already stretched after two weeks.I don't write reviews, but these are such an obvious drop in quality I just had to.I guess if you never had the older ones that truly are comfortable (and still are much better after 3 years) then you may think these are nice...I have to find a new alternative.."
1,Assorted Colors,"I am a fan of the boxer briefs but the material for this one is different than the ones I would have bought at my local shopping center. I thought it would be the same but it wasn't. Also the 'assorted colors' only came in 2 colors: black (2) and grey (2). The picture had black, dark navy blue, grey, and charcoal grey. I was very disappointed in this. I know I could have returned it but that would have just been too much work since I returned my other ones at the local shopping center."
2,Not what it used to me,"I wrote a review yesterday that was deemed too critical as i critised the aparent drop in quality since i first got them maybe 2 years ago and decided to get some more maybe a week ago, maybe becuase i mentioned the sellers name? there was no profanity in the original review, however i can say for a fact that these arnt as great as they used to be since i have the new boxers and old boxers in front of me as i write this review, the new ones are rather thin and flimsy compared to the older ones and im reviewing that these arnt that great but you cant beat the price i suppose, so for the price dont expect an amazing pair of boxers even if that was the case in the past.. theyre still comfortable enough and wont ride up in loose clothing.. however be ware of the quality difference if youre a old Hanes customer..."
1,Awful!,Don't waste your money. These boxer briefs ride up your leg and won't last but a few washings. I was so mad I e-mailed Hanes and told them I would never buy their product again and they sent me a refund.
2,Not happy,"My boyfriend hated the super high waist. I would have to agree, it looks ridiculous. This package is a size small but it definitely was a size too large. Hanes Classics Comfort Stretch with Wicking Boxer Brief is a better product from the same brand and Diesel Men's Kory Two Pack Boxer is the best. My boyfriend is in love with Diesel."
1,hate these underwear,"the band is narrow and poorly finished so it rubs against the skin uncomfortably - these had to be Hanes REJECTS - couldn't return them so I toss them out - total loss stay away from these crappy, uncomfortable underwear"
1,Awkward fit.,"These boxer briefs fit poorly. The waist is too high, reaching to my belly button. The crotch and seat are billowy. And the legs are too tight. I'm a normally shaped, average guy . . . when my wife saw me wearing these she burst out laughing. You get what you pay for."
4,Comfortable,"I would have given this a ""five star"" rating except for one thing: the material used is not as heavy as it used to be. I bought this same product last year at Target, and the cloth was a heavier weight then. Now, it seems as if Hanes is using a cheaper, lighter weight fabric. Still, these are the most comfortable kind of underwear I have ever had."
3,These are not like the older ones I have,"So, I bought these on amazon because I bought these at a brick and mortar a few months ago and they were fine. Well, Hanes changed their recipe, because the material is thinner, not as soft, and the legs are much longer. But they fit, and they will work. Just know that if you're buying these because of old ones you have, they might not be the same thing!"
3,hanes underwear,"These are good for the money, but lesser quality than I thought they'd be. Very thin material, and the hems are not very strong. Leg hole hems are not elastic. BUT as I said they're good for the money. Briefs at this price are semi-disposable in my opinion."
3,Too Much Fabric,"While I understand and enjoy the comfort waist, these boxer briefs use a little too much fabric in their design. Longer in the legs than previous designs often bunches up during my day to day use. Additionally, a larger flap is used that makes using the restroom difficult and more time consuming moving everything out of the way and returning it all to a comfortable position. Over all they still provide good support and the fabric chosen is comfortable to the touch."
3,Cheap? Yes. Comfort? Alright. Quality? Meh.,"My experiences with this product have been for the most part unexceptional. While the cloth covering of the elastic waistband is a nice addition to the comfort level the cloth itself is somewhat disappointing. If you were looking for Boxer Briefs with properties of compression shorts look elsewhere, as the material stretches out quickly and has a tendency to bunch up at inopportune moments. The longevity of these shorts are also in question as the material is very thin. At the moment I think I will get 6 months of heavy wear out of these briefs. Which for the price, is not an unreasonable lifetime for a low-tier bargain product. In sum, I am satisfied enough with my purchase to keep them but not satisfied enough to purchase again."
1,"Cheap, poor quality","I bought some of these same briefs about a year ago and really liked them, HOWEVER, these are not the same! The material is very thin and of a poor quality...I am very disappointed and will not take another chance on Hanes...I wonder if these are really Hanes or a cheap ""knock off"".."
1,"Fine for the price, but waist stitching is abrasive","The title says it all. Buy these only if you want your mid section cut by the waist stitching. I wore 1 pair for 1 workday, and by noon, I was ready to go commando because the stitching was so abrasive every time I'd move it felt like it was cutting into me. (And I work an office job, so it's not like I was really stressing the limit of these.) Otherwise the fit was excellent."
4,Best answer from a man,I purchased these underwear for my husband for Christmas. I have been asking him daily if he LOVES them and if they have changed his life! He said he likes them. They are comfortable and a good fit…..but not life changing.
3,It's Okay,Comfortable. Not sure of the durability. Needed more darker colors. But it is worth the price you pay for it.
3,"Ok, but not as good as Hanes' t-shirts","Wow, to what depths have we sunk that we write underwear reviews? Ok, now that that's out of my system, I have to state that these don't really live up to the Hanes hype. Generally shapeless and baggy, don't seem to be particularly special. No better, no worse than the random selection you might find at Target."
4,Very comfortable item,These briefs are comfortable; the only problem I have is with the opening; it's a bit too secure.
3,It was ok,They are too long. Overall quality is great and they are comfortable. I will recommend if the length was shorter.
5,why can't they all be like this,"As Jerry Seinfeld once said, men want the same thing out of their underwear as they do from their women . . . a little bit of support, but a little bit of freedom. These boxer briefs have a very comfortable fabric waistband, they go down far enough on the leg to be modest looking when the pants come off, but not too long to feel in the way. They fit well and provide enough support for even strenuous activity. My only complaint is that the little tag can scratch against me when I wear them inside-out (if you're a clean freak and consider wearing underwear two days in a row, this may not apply to you)."
4,Comfortable - Will buy again,"Hanes are not the most comfortable underwear but, they are good for the price. I would buy these again. The seller is excellent."
3,Just Ok,"Arrived quickly, good shipping, good cost. 'Not exactly what I was expecting, but then that's because I didn't read quite closely enough or at least because I didn't understand what was written vs. what I wanted. Even at that, these are Ok. There are other Hanes boxer briefs that personally I like better, but it's all in personal preference. Bottom line - I have no complaints."
2,Dull,A poor attempt to redo Dear America for the gulf wars after 911. It is a poor attempt of going to familiesof the fallen soldiers.
4,good strap,"I like the simple design and comfort of this strap. The strap attaches securely to the instrument using a hollow brass screw assembly. You won't have to worry about it slipping loose, however it does require the use of screwdriver to attach. My only complaint is that it is difficult to fit in my hardcase attached, but its also not convenient to remove because you need a screw driver.The leather and fleece are high quality and handsome."
4,Up Against the 8 Ball,"This was a great hustle movie but you have to get into the movie, I think it's a good movie. Would recommend it if you like pool"
1,What can you expect?,"For $19.49, you get that much quality...basically none. And Jessica is only trying to make more and more money with cheap rings. Save you money until you can buy a more decent ring that looks a lot better."
1,My 9 yr old has better rings !,"Although this ring is very pretty on screen ~ Buyer Beware ! In person it is cheap looking and a couple of the stones are crooked, I have not bothered to send it back ~ not worth the aggravation ~ my 9 yr old uses it to play dress-up (she has better looking dress-up rings in her collection - need I say more !)"
3,Ehh,I felt as though I was reading a report written by a kid in school at times. There was very little flow to the book. I did learn quite a bit about the man and his terribly selfish tactics. What a freak.
4,Puppetmaster: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover,Fascinating. Slow a the start but by the end I couldn't put it down. Describes how Hoover start out wanting to do the right thing but in the end it was all about keeping his power at any cost or at the expense of others. In the end what did he gain?
2,Isn't there anything new?,"Richard, there must be more info in all the research that you did. I thought you would pick up where Anthony Sommers left off. Hoovers faults were taken rather lightly instead of showing what an evil person he was-probably the most flagrant violator of civil rights this country has ever seen. I do give you credit for the fact you did bring up-if you didn't tow his line , you were ostrasized. His crime fighting skills were vastly overrated."
3,Poetic license.,"The author's resort to writing descriptive passages of entirely private moments in Hoover's life detracts from the supposed factual nature of this biography. For example, in describing Hoover's actions immediately after his aged mother's death he pictures Hoover standing "" naked at the bathroom window, his fleshy body chubby as a bar mizvah boy."" Say what? These little flights of literary embellishment diminish what is otherwise an interesting, popular biography of Hoover."
5,"Nice Show, Great Price","This show is not perfect, but morally better than 90% of what is on TV today.I bought it for my collection, we seldom what current TV.I will buy the rest when they are a good price."
5,Matlock - THe Second Season,My husband and I enjoy watching Matlock together---which is a good thing since he doesn't like anything but information type programming usually!
4,Still a fine read,"Purchased to add to my Western Americana collection, it still stands up as a fine read. If you love westerns, buy this and read it."
2,"Too tight, long, and hard","I've been testing out various thumbpicks to accent my fingerpicking style. This particular version falls short for a couple reasons, the first being that the ""Large"" size is still too tight for someone with large, manly hands. :) Second, the stiffness of this design leaves little room for play or dynamics while picking. Third, the length of the pick is just a bit too long, getting in the way of having a natural fingerstyle experience."
2,is the author confused???,"this book starts out telling the story of the murder of two precious little boys. to everyone who lives in rowlett, this was impossible...something like this just doesn't happen in our sleepy little town! i knew darlie, and have kept up with this case regularly. it is a very disturbing story. unfortunatly, the little boys are all but forgotten. i find it odd that most of her friends think she is guilty. most also tell a different story...of her screaming at the boys at the gas station, grocery store, etc. true, screaming is not murder, but most everyone does not agree that she was the doting mother. she was more interested in wearing sexy clothes and her gold jewelry. i wonder why mr. davis bothered to write this book. everything written points to her guilt, then he ends it with his own doubt?? no evidence of an intruder could be found. darlie just did a lousy job of planning and it backfired! she is where she belongs."
1,Noooooo Good,I DO NOT recommend this book. Purchase Barbara Davis' Precious Angels instead (same topic)...a much better read!
1,Don't read it if you think she's guilty,"The title is very deceiving--seems a good title to sell the book. The author makes his opinion clear as the trial approaches that he believes in Darlie's innocence. However, her story of what happened is akin to Jeffrey MacDonald's alleged 'hippie attackers'. The author attacks the good, solid evidence the prosecutor's present and prefers to put his faith in Darlie's version of events. One must conclude that she's the only person who could've committed these heinous murders."
2,Yankee author,"Although the story did hold my attention during the 1st few chapters, I soon began to lose interest. He seemed biased for Darlie Routier, and it showed. It seems to me that this author, and Patricia Springer, who have both written books on this case, were clearly more interested in voicing their opinions rather than facts and evidence on the case. Author is very much a yankee, and makes several snide commments on ""southern accents"" etc."
2,Hush Little Babies was far too sympathetic to Darlie Routier,As a resident of Rowlett I found this book far to sympathetic to Darlie Routier. It is indeed a sad and very frightening story. The murdered children seem to play a secondary role.
3,aA LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS,"THIS BOOK WAS HARD TO GET THROUGH. AT THE END, I WAS STILL WONDERING IF SHE KILLED HER CHILDREN OR NOT. THE LAST 10 OR SO PAGES WERE THE BEST OF THE WHOLE BOOK. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT HER HUSBAND DID NOT HERE THE CHILDREN SCREAM-SEEMS FAR-FETCHED TO ME."
4,Good choice for a Darlie book.,"Not the most exciting true crime type book. Not because the author did a poor job, but because the Darlie Routier case did not have any scandal. Still, if you are interested in the Darlie case, this is a good choice. The book is well written. The author did not take sides concerning guilt or innocence. I'm a little disturbed by the trial outcome."
4,The truth about Kerrville,"Don Davis proved to be at his best when he communicates to the world what happened to my daughter in the Kerrville Courtroom early '97. He stood up against the authors who slanted their books and articles to support the incorrect verdict given Darlie Lynn Routier. He is back by the court record that will eventually shock many conservative Texas as to how confused our judical system is. Practice sessions for witness, cops that performed while in shock, so called ""experts"" for the state that do exactly as they are paid to do. If anyone is interested in the true courtroom facts in the Routier case, this is the book to read. I applaud him for being so brave. Darlie Kee"
1,Extremely one-sided,This book is written by someone that obviously is on the side of Darlie Routier. I wouldn't doubt if he was paid by the family for his works. The book reads more like an commercial than a work of truth. He only presented the side that points to doubt (he left out much of the evidence that clearly points to her quilt). It is my opinion to not waste your money on this work of fiction on a sad true crime.
1,The kids hardly figure into it.,"This book was written by someone who is obviously sympathetic to Darlie. The boy's are almost a side issue. Ye, Darlie was not popular with the media or the public but does that make her inocent? No. Out of all the Darlie books this was the worst."
4,In Extremis - Latin title,"'In Extremis' is Latin, of course, not French. A good translation is 'in extreme circumstances'."
3,Ok for soft wood,"This is probably OK for very soft wood. The blades are not sharp enough to compete with the Loni Bird cove cutter or even a good 10"" inch saw blade on just about any hardwood."
2,Disappointing,"The first Jaran book was excellent and the Crown of Stars books got me hooked (other than book 4). As always, Kate's writing style is enjoyable, but this time the plot is a bore. Basically a silly romance, starting with the tough guy marrying the beautiful blond he hardly knows (only to run off to battle), and culminating with the a menage a trois between the hero, heroine and hero's ex-gay lover. Kate says male-female role reversal was a key part of her first book, and the woman with two men seems a natural extension of that, but the book became too engrossed in this and the need for an interesting plot (as in Jaran) sort of fell by the wayside."
4,Good as ordered.,"I finally opened the boxed packaged containing this tea. It was inclusive in having other items added as free samples. I have yet to open and try the tea, but I have had twig tea in recent past. So I am hopping that it is as remembered, nice roasted cup of twig.Thank you."
2,Not what I expected,The book was badly damaged...possibly through the mail system. I had hoped to give it as a gift but could not.
5,Not about the book but the movie,"I have the movie with Bridges and Thomas and I love it. It is called ""The Christmas Secret"" it is suppose to be taken from part of the book ""Flight of the Reindeer"" I don't know if that is true or not. Because I did not buy the book yet."
5,A MUST FOR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS...,"Attention all parents and grandparents. This is a must buy for Christmas -- maybe as a gift, maybe just to have to share with the children.I share this book with many children who are either on the edge of believing in Santa or have completely stopped believing. The scientific and professional articles in this book usually convince them to once again believe in the magic of Christmas and Santa Claus.This book is best used when a child and an adult look at it together. Some of the scientific concepts can be easily explained by an adult, adding to the experience."
5,wonderful book from a great author,"I know Mr. Sullivan, and spent many hours watching this book come together. The result astounded me. This is probably the best book on Santa ever written. I reccomend it to anyone. And yes, I do believe in Santa Claus. The illustrations are also top notch, with great attention to detail. Kudos."
5,"Pure Magic, Food for the Heart!","This book is an enchanting look into the legend of Santa Clause even the most mature adults will want to believe after reading this book. It's a great book to sit around the fireplace, drink some hot co-co, and read to your children. It's a great way to get you into the sprit of Christmas. It also has some interesting research. The library of Congress put this book under Non-Fiction how can you argue with that. There are also great illustrations in this book. This book is a great Coffee table book to have for the Christmas season."
5,looking for christmas inspiration,"I found this a long time ago in a bargain bin for $2. I *love* this book--it's one of my all-time favorite books. Although I haven't put up a tree in years, it's now a tradition to read this book every year. It puts me in the Christmas spirit--and adds realism, proof and perspective to the Christmas mission.Buy it and make your own family tradition."
5,An educator's review of Teaching with the Brain in Mind,"This book is an excellent resource in my class at Indiana University Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW). I use it in my X401 class, Critical Reading in the Content Area. To me, it only makes sense that teachers start teaching with the brain in mind. This book is an excellent source because it gives the necessary biological background and adds practical information for teachers, so there is theory and practice. This book will explain why great teachers do the things that they do. Again, an excellent source."
5,"It is the best book I, as a teacher, have ever been given.","This book has helped our entire staff understand what we need to do, as teachers, to get our students ready to learn. It unlocks many of the mysteries of why we use specific brain-friendly strategies.I am using several of the strategies in my classroom and also sharing the ideas of why I am using them with my students. They, too, are interested in how the brain works and what they can do to become better learners.It is exciting stuff and seemingly we are only at the beginning of understanding how to effectively use brain research to better our teaching strategies!"
5,"Readable, practical and the most valuable educator book yet","This is the first book on brain and learning that really got me excited again about teaching. I was so frustrated with my students, I was thinking about retiring. But this book showed me why things work and how to make them work better. Can't wait for the next book by Eric Jensen!"
3,Used is better,"This is a useful resource, but I would only order it used unless it was a very good price. Not as revolutionary as you would hope."
1,The sanding block just got worse,"I had a heavy solid rubber sanding block that I gave to my son. I ordered this one to replace it and was very disappointed. Cheap, flimsy light plastic and hollow shell. I can't imagine this lasting more than one good sanding session. Typical of things made these days, including most cars, appliances and tools. 3M used to be a quality-based company. Guess the good people in charge who cared about quality passed away. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a quality sanding block."
5,Excellent Modeler's Tools,"It works very well for my kind of use, which is scale model aircraft building & flying. It fits in my hand without slipping; very light weight, a plus for my needs. I used it to taper and smooth the edges of my airplane caddy/tote kit.I'm using the pre-cut adhesive-back sandpaper which is designed perfectly for this tool. The pre-cut sandpaper stays put because of the adhesive, however, you can easily remove and replace the pre-cut sandpaper without much loss of the adhesive backing."
1,Don't Buy,"3M 9248NA Sanding Block Kit, 2.75 in x 5.25 inThis sanding block is made of hollow plastic and just feels incredibly cheap. I thought I was buying the heavy rubber one that has been around for years, but instead I received a block of hollow lightweight plastic that I wouldn't trust not to shatter as soon as I put some real heft behind it. I will be tossing this thing in the trash and continue to use an old scrap piece of 2x4. This product is utterly worthless."
2,Unorganized book offers little that can't be found freely by searching,"Bob Bly is a wonderful person and a very good copywriter. But I don't like this book. It seems to go all over the place and yet no place. It really doesn't educate you on writing a white paper. Doesn't get into format or much else.You can find much more by doing a search.I know I'll get a lot of ""not helpful"" clicks. But that's okay. I gotta' tell it the way I see it. And, of course, it's only my opinion."
1,A rehash of other books,"After seeing the disparate comments on this book, I will venture my views. I generally like Bob Bly's books and I have quite a few of them on my shelves. But this is not his best. It's basically a rehash of a lot of material he has published elsewhere, with the term ""white paper"" in the title, I suppose, to attract sales. If you're looking for an introduction to all sorts of marketing ideas and a rundown on various formats for marketing documents... and you don't already have a lot of Bly's books, this may be useful to you. If you're looking specifically for a guide to how to create an effective white paper, or you already have some other books from Bly, this is not likely to help much at all. There are better books on white papers from Stelzner and Kantor, and on marketing with content from Ardath Albee and others."
1,"If You're Willing to Waste Your Time, Read This Book!","I found this book to be only marginally helpful in the quest for information about marketing white papers. I was surprised and disappointed given that it has received many good reviews.To begin with, it is long, boring and in severe need of editing. There is significant repetition from chapter to chapter. It feels like the author jammed together previously written articles into a book. I will acknowledge that there are some useful resources provided, but for the most part this is a hodge-podge of marketing tools and ideas that are not particularly insightful.If you need advice on marketing your white paper, I suggest reading Chapter 11 in Michael Stelzner's book, entitled Writing White Papers. It contains more useful information than this whole book."
4,Handy guide to marketing through information,"This helpful, how-to manual explains the essential elements of writing white papers and using them to generate business as part of your overall marketing plan. Author Robert W. Bly is a veteran practitioner. He covers every conceivable issue, from appointing a writer to choosing appropriate images and typefaces, to distribution. He has a fluid style and includes check lists that will give you a great framework for any white paper project. We recommend this handy guide to any marketer who is considering an ""edu-marketing"" strategy."
4,Simutaneously amuses parent and child,"No wonder it's an enduring classic - one of those kids' books that gets it right by entertaining the parents as well. Each self-contained chapter contains imaginative ideas that consistently amused my eight year old. He also enjoyed the absurd logic that resolves most stories. Ideal bed-time reading. Oh, the illustrations in my edition (by Robert Lawson) are also excellent."
5,A wonderful Epidemiology text book,"This book is a wonderful concise reference in Epidemiology in relation also to health administration . It is extremely basic , straight forward from a leader in the field .I enjoyed the simplicity of examples.Asaad A. Abduljawad"
5,Epidemiology can be this fun!,"I have never thought that epidemiology could be this interesting to learn. Many other books are dull to read comparatively, even though these other books may have more material to sell. This book by Dr Gordis stands out to be a great starter book for all."
5,In the shadow of the sacred grove,"This book in incredible. I read the book while in the Ivory Coast and can account for it's authenticity. In fact, I have read it over three times as it brings back the culture and the people that are so dear to my heart. Through her incredible writing skills the author brings Africa to life and provides a more complete accurate picture of West Africa. Excellent book, a definite must read."
3,Algeria 1920,"""Desert Winds: Travel in Algeria,"" by ""Hafsa"" The Century Co, 1927, English, cloth/hardcover w/ dustjacket; full-page photos, fold-out map; 386 pages with index, bibliography.

2,Great for beginners.,"Jason Chan teaches some very simple tai chi movements which are great for beginners, but more experienced players will be disappointed. This is not the Yang short form nor even the simplified 24 movement form. It is Jason's own short sequence of some simple moves and some chi kung movements as well as warm ups and cool downs."
1,No Thank you.,Our Dachsund did not like this at all. She would not eat anything that we put it on - even steak.
3,Okay...,This action figure is good except for the fact that it looks deformed and leaves you wishing a little more effort would have been put into it to make it look nicer and move more smoothly. My friends have even looked at it and said it just doesn't look right.
4,Beautiful Album,What caught my attention was the cover. More beautiful in person than the picture. Would definately purchase another album (different cover of course) from this seller. Fast and secure shippment. Smooth transaction. Thanks
5,Beautiful!,The photo album is beautiful and exactly as described. Very good quality materials! I highly recommned this seller!
2,pill poppin,I suffer from ibs therefore I have used products similar to this for some time now and decided to try this out. Now if you take dietary suppliments you know that very rarely are the directions to simply take one a day but this product advises you to take 4 pills 3 times daily. That's 12 pills a day. That seems a little much. I mean they could make them bigger or something. Seems like maybe a marketing ploy to make it seem like the bottle will last a long time but NOT SO TRUE. The other major concern is that the pills contain Iron. Iron is a very dangerous vitamin and can easily cause overdose. I do not want to take 12 pills for fiber that also contain Iron.
4,Seems good for minimal weight (not fat) loss quick,"I used for one week per instructions in conjunction with Acai berry supplement. I lost 10 pounds, but i discontinued after about a week (also per instructions). Suggested use is 10 days once every 2 months. I would use as a cleanser, but not as a legitimate weight (and by that i mean fat) loss product."
1,You probably need more than this.,"I think the fact is... if you just eat your fiber you won't need this product. Plus it has the same indigestible gelatin capsules as the other one. Plus, let's face it if you need a product like this you may have a larger problem than it can fix"
3,It works,"Like others said, 4 capsules 3 times a day seems way too much. I started with 2 in morning - 2 in evening, then increased that to 3 and now I'm just taking 4 at night and thats it. Its takes a few days to start seeing the effect. But it does work."
4,KILLDEE' OR BUST,Ohhhhh.... I want to see those baby killdeers. That's impossible....or is it ? Old Ruff and Janie have to find that mother bird's nest. This is a really good grade 1 level reader.Reminds me of LITTLE HOUSE. Very good illustrations by Vesta J. Seek.This book is about PATIENCE.
2,Not that entertaining,"Not that entertaining,...Benji's stand up act is way better, but this is kinda corny...There's only some many skits with Benji dressed like a girl I can take"
5,Sketch Comedy at its best,"I thought Dave Chapelle was funny, but when I bought this it made sketch comedy a whole lot funnier. lol.This is a must have for that laughter you need."
3,Wrong parts inside box,"I ordered 2 of these replacement struts. Original order arrived with one sensa-trac and one reflex strut that has a different mount base for the spring(the reflex has a plastic insert). All the labels on the outside of the Monroe boes were correct. The part numbers are the same except the last number, the sensa-trac is 71351E and the other was 71351L(which by Monroe's web catalog should be the entire assembly with spring for the sensa-trac strut)....nothing about the ""reflex"" stamping into the strut. Looks like Monroe sent a bad batch to Amazons warehouse, I sent the 1st back and the replacement was bad again. So now I have both bad one on the way back to Amazon and purchased one through a different dealer on amazon should be here today. Although this has been fustrating, Amazon was very quick to send out the replacement strut (even though is was bad too) and now has the product under review on the website."
2,Received two different models,"I haven't installed my struts yet, so I can't say how they perform. When I opened the boxes I found that I had been sent two different styles of the strut, what I assume are the old style and the new. On one, the lower spring seat is angled and has an offset for the end of the coil spring. On the other, the seat is straight and and perpendicular to the body, with a plastic spacer molded to fit the end of the coil spring. They are both stamped with the correct model number, and probably work equally well, but obviously I would prefer to have matching struts on each side, especially since they are visible. It's not worth the hassle to repackage and return them, but whoever filled the order should have put a little more thought into it. I guess if you buy discounted things online, this is one of the drawbacks."
3,Just so-so,"I replaced the 12 year old shocks on my 4Runner with 140,000 miles on them with these. I would say that the ride just barely improved. Probably as if the original shocks were made new again. But I don't think these are any better at all than the OEM shocks were, before they were worn out."
1,Not oil based,"Do not use this product.After spending several hours sanding & cleaning my teak patio set, I applied several coats of this product. While it looked great for a few weeks, it quickly began to wear off creating another sanding situation. This is not an oil but rather a shiny varnish that will not last and must be stripped off in order to reapply"
2,Political Book.,This book started of well and was an interesting book on the 2004 Democratic Primary Process. The problem with it is that you can tell that the author lost interest in this book and was all over the mao on his thought and writing. I would not reccomend this book.
1,Very solid but . . . .,"The product has a nice weight and feels solid in your hand, but . . . . it doesn't cut the cheese. We had a fiskars cheese plane for 15 years, which worked marvelously, but the constant stress finally caused the metal to fatigue, and the head fell off. While the Chantal feels like a designer product, it simply does not function adequately. Try something else."
3,Disorganized,"The organization really threw me off. I thought that I would never get how to play the guitar but it turns out that the way things are ordered just confuses you. They mention notes once at the beginning and then later ask you to play small scales. Later on I see a page on the notes on the guitar. Everything is kind of randomly placed instead of a book that you can advance through from front to back.It's a nice book besides that. Alittle rough around the edges, but still one of the decent guitar books out there."
5,Teach Yourself Visually Guitar,"Teach Yourself Visually GuitarI received this book right on time as stated when I purchased it. It was ""like new"" condition and a bargain for the price. I am a beginner guitar player, and I think that this book will be a great help to me."
3,He is itsy bitsy,Not bad but not really a quality toyNot something I would recommend to someone else
3,Pretty pictures,"Another one those wonderful coffee table book by Taschen publication. This book has a broader variety of homes like from the exclusive Aman hotel (Amanjena) to a humble farmer's house. It's not a book about how to live in Morocco nor about going remodeling or building a home in Morocco. It shows you what some foreigners and locals have done to their home.Book is cheaper than the previous Taschen book ""Moroccan style""."
4,Eye candy!,I bought this book primarily to serve as creative inspiration for my jewelry design - it worked! I now keep it on the table for others to enjoy...
5,Excellent introduction,"Balanced, concise, well-written. It's just about his life (the title!) but it does provide the historical context to enrich the listening of his works."
3,An Excellent Introductory Biography of the Composer,"This is an excellent and concise introductory biography of Schubert for the general reader. Gibbs debunks many of the Schubert myths that have arisen since his tragic early death, and explores Schubert's social mileu. Of primary importance in Schubert's life is his circle of male friends. In addition he tackles some of the recent research concerning the composer's possible homosexuality, and explores some of the rudimentary evidence that exists about Schubert's relationships with women. What is lacking in this book is more analysis of Schubert's oeuvre."
2,"equivocal, halting, and awkward","I'd cut this more slack if it were the only biography of Schubert ever written. Obviously it is not, so how does it distinguish itself from the others? It was more recently published, and that, I'm afraid, is it. It is always hedging, it wants desparately to offend nobody, and manages in this way to offend at least me."
2,"Hard book, not for a novice .","Hard book. Not basic explanations, very complex written, hard to read . I couldn't read 50 pages. I decided to sell it and buy another. I lost my time with it and finally I ended up reading on internet or wikipedia about graphs and trees where you can find a 10 times easier and better explanation."
5,Very effective introduction to algorithms,"The book used in my graduate Intro to Algorithms course, and I think the follow-on. While I am obviously not as well read in this subject as many of the other reviewers, I can say ""it worked"", and indeed worked well. A course that has a weak text or teacher will not inspire... A-H-O/DACA and Prof. Carlson made the material exciting, even to an ""architecture guy"". My interests in grad school in the early 80's revolved around tessellation automata (aka systolic arrays and other highly regular compute structures) and big steaming fast computer structures. A-H-O provided me with the best understanding of the kinds of problems faced by the computers which interested me the most, and the kinds of tools needed to understand computational impact and algorithmic structuring of solutions to them. I sincerely with I hadn't lost my copy with the hundreds of annotations in the margins."
3,Hard reading...insanely mathematical,"This book is hard to read as it is treated in complete mathematical rigor. Not for the uninitiated. You are better off reading Sedgewick or even a wonderful cheap version from O'Reilly called Algorithms. If you are a Phd candidate, this may be your cup of tea otherwise take this review as a sip of bitter foretaste.Compared to this, I very much think the Knuth Fundamentals of Algorithms is a better read altogether."
4,From Russia With Love,"The music, the sites throughout Russia and the explanation of what the culture represented in the past would be enjoyed be anyone."
4,Studding Voice,I stumbled upon this artist by accident and am so glad I did. His selection of music is unlike that which I've heard before and his voice is that of an angel. Apparently he's very popular in Europe. He has added immensely to my listening pleasure.
1,Elevator Music...,"... so heavily sugar coated it can cause a major nausea. Taste the real (sugar free) stuff and get ""Moscow Nights"" by Dimitri Hvorostovsky. Wow!!!..."
2,"Not inspirational, not language for your child","I was wanting an inspirational animal story book. There are some parts that are fine about the author's dog, but there are too many ""foul language"" parts, and the author's own opinions about God and Christianity that are not really true. They are opinions which is fine, but they impart ideas and descriptions about God that I don't think are good or uplifting or true. I would not recommend this book."
3,An Okay Album,"This would not be my first recommendation. There are some that I like much better. The songs are good, but the whole thing just doesn't seem to touch like most. I did enjoy Jimmy Dean. Bless his heart, it was good to see him. Lynda Randall does a great job on 'His Eye is on the Sparrow.' I would like to have had Ben Speer finish 'Til the Storm Passes By. It would have made it more special to me. Nothing wrong with the Booth Brothers, but the song is really serious, and I would have preferred that, as Ben started it, he finish it. Maybe I am just silly. You will probably like it okay.Mickey"
5,The best yet in the Gaither Video series.,"I have seen several of the videos, but this one is by far the best. It is uplifting and encouraging. The testimonies tell of the love of a savior who is also a redeemer.The video will make you laugh,and it will make you cry, but most importantly, you will experience the majesty of Jesus through this worship experience. This video is wonderful"
3,Review,"The book was not as advertised, it had signs of wear on it. Didn't get here as expected, the time it was purchased took too long to get here."
3,Essentials of the US Health Care System,"While the book is enlightening, (it is a required text for Health Care Organization for the program I am in) I find it blatantly biased. In the very first chapter it is evident that the authors prefer a single payer system, and mention the Canadian, British, and German systems, and prefer the Canadian system. As we have progressed through the book, the bias toward a single payer system has been reenforced. We have too many specialists, not enough generalists, etc. All that is true, but the solutions they are offering will not work to the satisfaction of the American public, if looking at the Canadian system is any indication. The waits there for basic care, dentistry, etc., are long. Overall, I think the book has many valid points about our system of health care. Just be aware of the authors bias as you read the book."
5,Great condition and arrived very quickly!,"The description said ""May be a few highlights and pages slightly worn,"" but it had no highlighting and was in great shape. Book was quickly shipped and arrived very quickly as well.Thanks and I plan on using this seller again!"
1,Shipped wrong address,Book was shipped by US mail to my street address not my billing address. I finally had to get it from somewhere else.
1,"Like our HealthCare System, this book is falling apart","Literally, every time I turn a page, the page, along with 3 or four before and after it, falls out. It seems as if the binding is held together with (crappy) glue and nothing else...I literally have a rubber band around the book to keep it together.Only advantage...if you could call it that: I dont need to carry the whole book around with me because I can just take out the chapter that I need to read and take it with me wherever I go!Oh...annddddd the film on the cover peeled off on day 1.Absolute piece o crap."
4,hear this,"Sorry, I hate to be a pedant (but who appreciated passionate pedantry more than Nab?) but I have to correct the reviewer below me and point out that Transparent Things is one of Nabokov's LAST works, published when the master was still milking his mind at the age of 74 and still residing on Terra the Fair. Also, easy does it, and keep your eye on that bombastic critic."
3,Nabokov's inaccessibility,"What _Pale Fire_ and _Lolita_ don't represent about much of Nabokov's work is the fact that it often seems to shut the reader out of its world--or at least leave him/her looking in through a frequently obscured peephole. _Transparent Things_ is a novel which epitomizes this inaccessibility but it is this very difficulty of ""identifying"" with characters or ""connecting"" with the book's themes that makes it fascinating. A more cereberal adventure, perhaps, even, than _Pale Fire_ (and certainly more than _Pnin_, _Speak, Memory_ or _Lolita_), this novel is nonetheless worth the quick read that it requires."
4,Humidity Meter,It is handy to know the relative humidity in my bedroom as I use a dehumidifier to control the excess humidity. A dust mite allergy iskept under control by having the humidity below 50%.
4,"Has worked well for years, but recently stopped displaying data.","I've used this for years now with nothing but good things to say. It can be stood up like a picture frame, or can be hung from a nail on the wall. It has always been super accurate. However, very recently I noticed I had dashes across all areas that display data and it was still bright, meaning it probably wasn't battery related. I changed batteries anyway, but that did not help. I ended up disassembling it and moving a few of the connectors on the board from side to side hoping it was a lose connection, and it was! Works well after a little tinkering and still going strong."
3,Problems popping up,"After about a year of use, pushing the button to reveal minimum/maximum readings only infrequently, the button is beginning to malfunction, requiring several very firm presses most times to get the readings to come up. It's complete death appears emminent. You could probably do better."
2,It's a thermometer and humidimeter,"For some reason I don't know, the product claim Wirless 433 Mhz Radio controlled on its instruction manual cover, and it's by ""the weather channel"", make you wondering if there is some fuction related to radio. No, it is not, it is just a thermometer and humidimeter."
1,Just was not very well put together,"The patterns themselves are not sized, just a small note on them like "" Pattern designed to fit 7 year old"", so unless you had a 7 year old who was lucky enough to be the particular size of the pattern, you had to do a lot of altering. This is not easy because of the pleats and points and gathers on these dresses. This book only had three boy patterns, and they were for outfits that would only be good for halloween costumes. The patterns themselves have to be inlarged using the 1in=4in grid which is timeconsuming and troublesome. There were very few accessories, and in total only eleven outfits. It would have made more sense for me to buy a couple of patterns at the store, most come with several different designs for dresses, full size patterns in the size you need, and clear directions. I have bought other similar books over the years, but none as poorly writen as this one."
4,A real rarity for Mancini fans,"This import combines two complete soundtracks from the early part of Mancini's career, and both have been long out of print. ""Hatari"", besides featuring the sounds of the jungle which Mancini scored using actual instruments and gords brought to him by director Howard Hawks, contains some good jazz as well (especially a swinigin' ""Big Band Bwana""). ""High Time"" has some fine moments as well, and both albums show why Mancini was always in such great demand by Hollywood. The price for this two-fer is nice, too, considering the pricetag found on other imports."
1,Overrated,"This book is based on the premise that Karl Rove is an evil genius. Once it asserts this it then fits all sorts of facts and rumours to prove this.Rove may be a talented operator, but an objective look at his results would show he is no genius. He got lucky in 2000 (lets face it the election was Gores to win) then rode off 9/11 to win in 2004. Given Bush's approval ratings in 2002, to assist in the loss of Congress in 2006 points to terrible advice.Cannon may be transfixed with Rove (and it comes across in this book) but you shouldn't be!"
1,Original music gone ! No sale here,Well I was all set to buy these dvd sets of My Three Sons until I realized the original music was gone and replaced- I wanted this show in tack and not edited - espeacilly the music score- that was alot of its charm . WEll I wont be buying this series now- thats to bad- I wanted to orginal show as it was. The music was a big part of this and any show......... to bad.........
1,Donna Reed Show versus My three sons,"If you compare the price of fews serials,$53.00 for 1 season!I d'ont buy.I'll buy ""Father knows bset and The Donna Reed Show"""
1,My Three Sons,"I have not bought nor will I buy this DVD only because of the bad reviews, which point out the bad remix of sound, not playing the original theme and by slicing and dicing the series instead of one volume. I'll watch this series via Netflex and save my funds for better value DVDs."
1,A Damaged Gift,"Originally when I ordered this I ordered it as a gift with another DVD for a family member. A couple weeks after it arrived I visited and decided to open it to make sure it was in good condition. However, upon opening the completely undamaged box I found the contents inside were damaged to the point I could not give it as a gift. Both DVD cases were slashed on the back and then taped over with the bar code as if to hide the fact it was damaged."
1,"You fooled us once Paramount/CBS, but not again","Come back for our money when you decide not to butcher this classic show with your awful music/sound substitutions. I was fooled once with your volume 1 release, but I've learned my lesson.I'm only giving this 1 star, sadly 0 stars doesn't appear to be an option."
1,Send A Message to CBS/Paramount: GREED IS NOT GOOD!,"It is a real shame that a juggernaut like CBS/Paramount is taking advantage of consumers with releases like this. For fans of these old series, it is a no-win situation. If you buy this DVD, you're telling CBS/Paramount that is okay to release a half season of cut episodes minus the original music and charge full price. However, if you don't buy this DVD, you run the risk of CBS/Paramount not releasing further seasons due to poor sales. Probably the best thing to do is write to CBS/Paramount and let them know that you are interested in the DVD but do not appreciate that they are charging full price for a half season's worth of episodes which have been altered from their original format.NOTE: This rating does not reflect the quality of the show which would warrant 5 stars. It reflects the horrible decision of CBS/paramount to break up the first season and overcharge the customer."
1,Greed,"I wanted to put together a collection of 60's and 70's TV shows for my young sons, so they could experience what I grew up with. However, the greed of corporate America is endless. $26.00 for a half season. The content is valuable and timeless, but the plastic involved in the DVD and case could not be more than 30 cents. The world is facing a recession that it may never recover from due to the unchecked greed displayed by the suppliers of this DVD."
5,Brookey convicted on little evidence,"I am an attorney in Las Vegas who read Mr. Puit's book to get to know some of the main law enforcement operators in Las Vegas.Mr. Puit sets forth a wealth of information in West's case. Based on the information provided, it seems that West was convicted of murder on very shaky circumstantial evidence.The cause of death of her mother was undetermined. No murder weapon was adequately identified. The motive was not clear cut. There was no eye-witness of the murder, just a bunch of witnesses that made a case that West was weird.It appears to me that West was convicted simply because she was different. ""Guilty by reason of weirdness.""All of her alleged victims were weirder still.However, she was a criminal who committed a series of property related crimes including shoplifting and identity theft. Such crimes could be attributed to her poor upbringing and her mental problems.Murder? I think there was reasonable doubt based on what this book presents."
1,Witch,"A waste of time to even read. I am, however, someone who has to generally finish a book once I start. In this case I wish I had not started."
4,great read!,Really good book - I got it from some Amazon.com reader's 10 best true crime novels and if this one was any indication of the rest of them - he/she right on the money!! Very graphic - pictures are definitely NOT for the faint of heart. I still can't get them out of my head
2,"Started out good, but that didn't last long","I was initially intrigued, but unfortunately wound up being extremely disappointing. The author was a bit too self-important for my taste, and new information became more and more scarce as the book progressed. One of the later chapters isn't even an original work, but is instead a wholesale reproduction of a coroner's report.Not recommended."
3,interesting,"Though it was not one of the best true-crime books I've read, it certainly is worth reading."
2,poorly written,"I was shocked to find out that the author is a journalist/reporter. The subject matter is a very good choice. The writing is bad. The author goes off on unimportant tangents for perhaps 20 pages at a time until you start to lose track of what the main story line is,and he does this abruptly without warning. Has gratuitous sex and profanity. By gratuitous I mean just that,a large amount that is not important to the story and therefore not only ceases to shock but becomes boring. I finally only decided to finish the book because I was unfamiliar with the case and wanted to know what happened. I would have thought the author would have learned his craft before attempting to write a book. Ialso do not understand why it was not edited by the publisher and allowed to go to market this way.Avoid this author. Maybe read something like True Story: Murder, Memoir, Mea Culpa by michael finkel instead to see how a journalist is capable of telling a real story.peter soldan"
3,GOOD DETECTIVE MOVIE. BUT WHY IS IT CALLED A CLASSIC?,"I don't see what all the hype is about with this movie. The box I got it in said it's a classic! I mean it's a good detective movie and all and the answering machine was ahead of its time in 1955. But I've seen better whodunnits that aren't as violent as this one is and ones with someone to at least root for. You can't tell the good guys and girls from the bad in this movie! And the ones who aren't bad like Nick the mecanic are totally annoying. I turned the sound down everytime he made the va,va room car sound."
3,There's nothing quite like it,"Maybe I just didn't get this one. It's pretty campy and over-the-top which makes it fun and fascinating in a strange way but if you're looking for a noir classic, look elsewhere. This one's more of an odd (if oddly influential) curiosity."
3,"A good 50's detective story, but not great.",The best thing about this film is the acting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer. He does a great job. But the plot runs slowly and the ending is not credible. It's not a bad movie but I fail to see how it is rated a classic.
4,It's 'The Bomb',"This late entry into the film noir genre has some harsh and memorable scenes and an ending unlike any other film noir. Of course, most of those weren't made during the A-Bomb scares of the mid 1950s, as this was.The movie features a tough, no-nonsense Mike Hammer-like private eye, played well by Ralph Meeker, whose narration is a little dated but fun to hear. This is one of those noirs in which everyone is a tough-talking, tough-acting mug and one never knows who to trust. Except for Cloris Leachman, who is only in the first quick (but haunting) opening scene, the females in here are unfamiliar actresses but people with interesting faces and personalities.That opening with Leachman is a real attention-grabber and is one of the best starts I've ever seen in a crime movie. It's very creepy, as is the unique ending. I also appreciated the cinematography in here a lot more once the DVD was issued."
2,Disappointed and Puzzled,"I was disappointed in this movie. I chose it having read the critic and customer reviews. I was disappointed - especially in some of the acting and also the directing which may have been responsible for what I consider to be poor choices from the actors and I was puzzled by the mostly rave reviews from critics and custsomers. I'm sorry to disagree with almost everybody else but there it is - and we were so looking forward to seeing this film. Considering especially the year in which it was made, it was just too primitive in execution for me. Some other films made earlier seem, to me, far ahead of this one."
1,Sleepy,"I Agree with the last review here, so and stagie End of Noir was at least eight years prior this just reminds us of how we miss the Classic Black Cinema Features from the 40's."
3,Influential,"I will not talk about the plot, as the story took some interesting turns that came as a pleasant surprise. The movie drags at points, but is fun overall. The look of the film has clearly been a big influence on many films - from Lost Highway to Repo Man and Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it is the slightly surreal night scenes that have the most impact and constantly reminded me of the works of David Lynch.The dvd print is average quality, a little murky at times. The dvd itself is bare bones with just a trailer and an alternate ending, which is mostly the same but truncated."
3,Sordid and dislikable,"The Bottom Line:It may seem odd to criticize a film for being sordid when that's almost certainly the feel it was going for, but Kiss Me Deadly's incredible misanthropy and misogynism just kinda made me want to take a shower; also hampered by the fact that the central character of Mike Hammer never manages to be very interesting, Kiss Me Deadly is ultimately worth watching more for its influence on later films (e.g. Pulp Fiction, Raiders of the Lost Ark) than for its actual worth as a movie.2.5/4"
5,An exciting mystery set during World War I.,"Twelve-year-old Pam lives in North Carolina in 1918. When a stranger with an accent arrives in town, Pam immediatley suspects he's up to no good - maybe he's even an enemy spy! With the help of her dog and her homing pigeons, Pam sets out to find the truth. Read this book to find out what happens!"
3,"OK, But not a ""High Flyer"" in my book.","I read this book in about 3 1/2 hours. I had previously read one other ""History Mystery"" book about 3 years ago when I was in 4th grade. The plot of the story is this:12 year old Pam Lowder hates school. She especially hates her worst enemy, Henry. When she discovers that her prize winning pigeons with the rare ability to ""home"" at night are missing, she is furious, and the mysterious Mr. Arminger, a new man in town with a German accent, is a prime suspect. (The whole town believes that he is a German spy, it is World War I) Pam must collect her wits and, well, do something about it."
4,Dancin'the Night Away in a Love Buzz,"Dancin' The Night Away was a single in our country in september 1981. Love Buzz (which is Dancin' The Night Away part 2!) didn't chart in our country but it could easily have been. I remember school-partys playing this tune to death, so don't blame me for playing this disc every now and then. The Richie Revera mix is also very enjoyable. Some of the other songs are ok. but Voggue will always be remembered for the first 2 tunes."
2,Has a few good points,"I don't usually go in for this genre, but thought it might be worth reading because there were no flowers, lace or jewelry involved in the low-key cover art. I find sulky, tempestuous, byronian heroes (?) and heroines which are either addled-pated tantrum throwers, or close-lipped, longsuffering martyrs who torture themselves keeping agonizing secrets a source of fatigue. It all overdraws on my power to suspend disbelief. Two things, though; the sex was pretty good, and I found the ""story within the story"" of Aidan and Skye utterly enchanting."
3,Disappointed,"After some of the reviews I thought this book would be great. I love Irish romances. This book did not deliver. I am a very fast reader and at 8 days I still had about 60 pages to go. In the middle it became so tedious and like someone else said, if I hear the word ""geis"" again I will really ...... One word, no two....laborious and disappointing. I have read much better. Sorry for this review, keeping it honest."
4,Wonderful Story,"I have read the majority of Meagan McKinney's other works. And in my humble opinion, this is the best. This story is a work of art."
3,"Dated, sexist","I am reviewing the 1980 version of this book, available at my local library. It has some good information, although I think it addresses only a very narrow spectrum of the way people might attempt to be verbally abusive/manipulative etc. It does this in a way that I don't think is flexible enough to really be useful except in a limited range of circumstances. Unfortunately, the examples used are extremely dated and often quite sexist. Perhaps her ideas about men and women were more appropriate in the 1950's and 1960's but they do not readily apply to the current context of the way men and women relate or the way they are raised. Perhaps an updated version might be of more value."
2,Gentle Art of Staying Awake While Reading,"I really wanted to read this book after reading the great reviews it got. I also found the chapter titles to be very eye catching. However, the author wrote this book in a very dry and monotonous tone and could not keep my attention even after a whole cup of espresso straight. I suppose this is a good book, if you have a very good atttention span."
1,Completely Worthless,"I guess just about *anyone* can get a book published nowadays. The author clearly has no understanding at all of rhetoric outside of her own personal experience of having been insulted-- which I imagine must happen quite often. Essentially the entire book is centered around providing canned responses to eight verbal attacks, and arranging them in an 'octagon'. Why this arrangement is preferable to any other, or what is to be gained by any sort of arrangement, remains unexplained. The one thing I do recommend in this book is the (presumably unintentional) humorous maternalistic tone that seeps through when the author writes about the protection that her fragile women need from strong, angry men... very funny indeed. If you really are looking for a book that will teach you something, rather than give quick and empty entertainment, try ""Logical Self-Defense"" by Johnson and Blair. I haven't finished it yet, but they are obviously on a whole different level than Elgin."
3,review,"While the techniques described in the book are generally helpful and reasonable I do have some complaints. First, the context of the book is very clearly that of housewives in the 1980s needing to learn how to stand up to verbal abuse. This would be fine if the book weren't trying to have a wider applicability. The example all assume that the reader lives in a hetero-normative stereotypical world where everyone thinks exactly the same way. At one point the author states that men are given more training in verbal self defense then women simply because they get to watch male role-models dominate conversations more often then women would see female role models dominate conversations. She is implying that men can only strive to be like men and women can only strive to be like women, re-enforcing the very problems she seems so keen to fight. Ultimately though I'm just kind of disappointed that gender needed to be brought up at all."
5,Self Help helps!,"I had read this book before, and it was excellent inhandling beligarant relatives! Helps to understandones self plus others!"
2,Worth the read,"The book is worth reading since it highlights the issues of underlying suppositions in a verbal exchange. Focusing on this will surely save much frustration. However I can't say that I have run into any of her 8 standard verbal attacks. The chapters on body languange, as well as gender language styles are all quite dated."
5,What they SHOULD teach in grade school but don't!,"I don't understand why this book is out-of-print. The information included in it is valuable and unavailable anywhere else. This book should be required reading for all sixth and seventh graders and schools should teach it. If they did, maybe our society would have more emotionally healthy teenagers than we do. And in the south, no parents who love their daughters should dream of letting them have contact with other young girls before they are given a thorough grounding in this book's contents. I'm serious! I found a battered old second-hand copy of this book not long ago and I am already beginning to enjoy the benefits. I popped one southern belle shark with some of this and she backed off! Nothing is more valuable than emotional well-being."
5,Re-visit what you think you know,"Relationship manipulation through words is unmasked.After reading this book, you'll have no excuse for being made to feel bad, or doing things through others' manipulations.An eye opener. I re-read this book in 2000, and, incredibly, found that I was allowing some of these no-nos to occur regularly in my marriage communication! Yikes!Some of these techniques can be shrouded in ""well meaningness"" which can slip by, confuse you. It did me. Always good to re-visit what you think you know!"
1,Waste of money,"Too pricey, do not buy standalone tape better buy it with paper package. BTW it sticks fine, great quality product."
1,Not the product I thought I was getting,"I could have ordered this incorrectly, but all it is is tape. I wanted insulation strips to puty around windows"
3,USED to work great,"I've used this window film tape for around 10 years, and always considered it the best - until this year, 2010. It simply isn't working - it has very low adhesive properties. Now, after a strong wind, or for no apparent reason, the tape fails. I've used different batches of tape and compared notes with friends who use this, and they also say the tape is no longer effective."
3,window seal,"I use it on window seal kits to stop drafts.Works ok as long as you get the plastic on the tape properly the first time.If you have to redo the plastic seal you will need to use new tape.It sticks great only one time,don't screw up."
2,Not really happy with this batch... less than 8 weeks and it's coming down,"I bought this tape to use to put plastic over our windows. I bought this specifically because the stuff that comes with the shrink window insulation is usually cheap.This stuff came down on 6 of 7 windows! I am floored and shocked and pretty upset.I put this plastic insulation over my windows every year for 10 years. This is not a new process for me.TO have one window come loose is rare. TO have 2 window seals come loose is extremely rare. To have 6 of 7 is unheard of!I""m really not pleased.And i use the Scotch brand each year. I don't know why this did not hold, my only guess i that this taps has been sitting for a long time on the shelf and it's old. Can't explain it otherwise."
4,Funny!!,"Humor is not what science-fiction is noted for, but Sladek managed to do it with great wit and energy. The first half of this book features some of his dizzyingly delightful short stories, but the real reward for long-time sf readers comes in the second half, where he parodies the style and substance of the golden-age sf writers: H. G Wells, Robert Heinlein, and (most memorably) Isaac Asimov, among others.One book for the short-shelf of science fiction's most delightful books."
1,Poor Customer Service,I ordered a pair and they were too big...so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable... one month later it did not come... Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me.... whereas I know it is do-able.. Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes .. So finally I paid $15 to send the boots back. on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $.. I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee. I will never ever buy from The Sportsman's Guide again...
5,as good as uggs,"These boots are warm, comfy and a great deal. The only thing missing is the ""ugg"" label, so if you're into quality and not brand these are the boots for you."
3,minnetonka boots,The boots were a steal for the pirce I paid 39.00 right before christmas but the size 5 is not a size 5 it is more like a size 6 so even though I put in a shoe pad my sock continues to slip off towards me toes. if your a size 7 get a 6 you will thank me later. And the customer service person was a little rude as well so I'm stuck with the boots unless my feet grow one size over night.
1,WAY TOO LONG!!!,This is taking way too long! I ordered my item 3 weeks ago and it is still not here. i cannot track my package either. i will never buy from them again!
1,de-klein to buy this book,"klein is famous for her tops. it seems as though she wants to keep her 'know-how' secret. the pictures show you the steps, the descriptions vaguely tell you what to do - i didn't need to spend $15 to tell me the obvious. this was a lazy attempt to publish a book. you are better served to go to the internet and find countless projects for free that have detailed measurements and specifications. this book is headed for the woodturner's club library to be seldom used."
2,THE CHILD DEVIANT,I love Haujobb...but this is a verry weak release. IDM or wahtever there calling this kind of music...it's mostly just baoring. Not that it's lacking in talent or art direction or even in production....it's just plain baoring. If your new to Haujobb I strongly suggest you avoid this album and atsrt with 'Vertical Theory' or even 'Polarity'. This album is just not that interresting.
1,NOT THE PRODUCT ADVERTISED!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"The product I was supposed to be buying was not the product I received. It was totally different & didn't even have the contents listed anywhere on the package! I have a 3 year old, what if he were to swallow some & I call the poison control line what am I supposed to tell them that it is he swallowed? DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4,Good for the big twins...,"...unfortunately, I own a small block Lario & there wasn't heaps in this volume for me.I was rather concerned at the antiquated system described for painting Guzzis. The days of using a brush & enamel are (hopefully) gone. There are suitable colour codes available for the older bikes & any good car painter should be able to match your paint. Also, the method of applying transfers as outlined, scared...me! In fact, it's easy & the newer paints don't hurt them at all.As the paint job is (arguably) the most important part of a restoration, I think more effort could hve gone into this aspect.I must admit, colour wiring diagrams would have been useful & worth a few extra sheckels to obtain.Hard to get it perfect, but still some useful detail between the covers."
1,Un-Sherlockian,This book was a complete disappointment. It is apparently self-published and self-edited and the errors in grammar and continuity fairly scream off the page. The author fails to capture Victorian England of 1896 by making several errors of historical fact. Most distressing of all is the total failure to capture the characters of Holmes and Watson in the style that Conan Doyle created them. The personalities are all wrong and the dialogue completely misses the mark.If you are ready to move beyond Doyle's canon this is NOT the tome you wish to peruse. There are too many other excellent Holmes collections available.
5,Second best book of all of the 2 triologies!,"With the exception of the very first book, Kignmaker's Sword, this is the best of all of Ann's books in both the Rune Blade and Sword in Exile Triologies. I love how she makes two stories come together so nicely. I found both main characters very compeling and well rounded. Ann writes a great book and they just keep on coming."
4,Great first bluetooth experience,"This was my first bluetooth headset. I decided to buy it thanks to the other reviews on here, and also the price.Received the product well packaged with ample instructions. After charging it got it connected to my XV6700. It also works well with skype on my laptop, although switching from one device to the next is problematic...which I doubt is due to the headset.Battery life is very good and the sound quality and range is awesome. It's also very comfortable on the ear.Other than the device switching my only other gripe is the power and volume buttons are somewhat small and hard to press for the hands of a 6'0"" tall man. However, the call button is perfectly fine...definitely not a show-stopper and I would buy this product again."
3,Bulky but it's alrite,"well, it's bulky as u can see ! And the pairing with my Treo is terrible. Keep logging off from my phone. I dont know if anyone out there has the same problem. Very comfortable and very clear to hear."
4,GREAT VALUE,"PURCHASED FOR USE WITH PS-3 FOR ONLINE GAMING. WORKS GREAT, EASY SET-UP AND CONFIGURATION. EXCELLENT BLUETOOTH!"
5,The best bluetooth Ithats been in my ear,"One day walking to the gym, my Jabra BT125 fell off my ear, lost to the streets around UC Berkeley. It dropped off a lot. I knew there would be a time it would be gone, so I never let myself get too personally attached. :-)I purchased the Plantronics 510 a month ago and am extremely satisfied. It fits better and sounds better. It hasn't fallen off my ear. Useability is fine.The power button is itty bitty and needs to be pressed hard, but when you use it a couple times its fine. Good battery life. Thumbs-up."
2,Just keeps Charging,Received the 510 headset plugged it in and it charged for two days before I taken it off of the charger. Even though it was still charging. Won't pair up with phone. Sent back for exchange with Plantronics. This is not the first 510 I have had. This is about the 7th or 8th one. I keep getting them because this is the only one that I found that works correctly with my hearing aids and problems. But they don't last very long.
2,Very cheap (and also sounds like it),"I was excited to see so many good reviews for this product, in my mind I was going : ""can ~1000 people saying it's a good product be all wrong ?""Sadly the answer for me is ""yes"" - it sounded horrible , it felt cheap and I did not like the sound.Shipping it back."
2,Fair quality,This was a marginally acceptable product. It did not live up to its descriptions as a noise cancelling device and it was very uncomfortable to wear. I sold it on Craigs List.
3,Definitely buy the newer version instead,"The newer Voyager Pro is much, much better but this was a good bluetooth device in it's day. Not as tough as I would have liked though."
1,I've gone through 2 of these,"At first I thought it was me, but it wasn't... I bought 2 of these over the period of a year... the rubber comes undone from the ear plug and the wires get split and broken, and then it's all over..."
5,Works Great!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He has had several motorola bluetooth headsets before this one. I read the reviews and thought I would get it for him and see what he thinks. He knows his technology. It was easy to hook up to his Motorola Q, and the noise reduction was excellent. He often drives with the window down and I couldn't even tell. The call was very clear and I could not tell he was on his headset.If my husband gives it 5 stars, then you know it is a good product!"
5,Love this Bluetooth!,"This Bluetooth is THE BEST! The talk time is long, with clear noise free quality conversations. It maybe a bit large and heavy but it is balanced and quite comfortable, I do not have a problem keeping it on all day. It is easy to use with a touch of the button to answer or disconnect a call. It was easy to pair to my iPhone also. I love this Bluetooth!"
1,Too noisy during call,"Don't buy this nor jawbone black, both turned out to be too noisy when they were supposed to eliminate noise.I'm better off with the ear phones.-Sri M"
4,Customer service is good.,"Weekend there is no customer service, but on weekdays it rocks. I like the quality of this product. I paired this one with my cellphone(LG) and the laptop( windows XP,iogear) and it is working great."
4,"Good sound, difficult buttons","The sound quality of this headset is much better compared to other BT headsets I have used. In poor reception areas, the headset creates a constant clicking sound, but with fair reception the quality is as good as the cell phone speaker. Finding a headset with background noise cacellation is essential and this model does that well. Without the noise cancellation, you can forget using BT devices while walking. What I don't like are the minisule buttons on this headset. Even after months of use, the volume button feel is not intutive, because I can not tell if I pushing up or down, because the button is so small. Battery life is good, it usually exceeds my phone battery."
4,Bluetooth headset 510 Plantronics,"The inside ear piece is just TOO big and cant adjust it enough so it wont make the ear hurt really bad and get sore. other then that when its on it sounds like a open microphone, other then that its great"
3,Not totally dissatisfied,"The unit seemed exceptionally comfortable when I first tried it on. But after 10 minutes or so of wearing it, it becomes pretty uncomfortable from the earbud, and also on the back of the ear. It's very hard to use the volume control while wearing the headset. The power button is ridiculous - a pain to turn on/off, literally with a little tab jammed into the tip of your finger. When linked to the phone, it works awesome, but often loses connection (quite possibly the fault of my cell phone and not the headset). This is only the second I've tried, and it's better than the other. But I would think there's got to be a better one out there somewhere."
4,Great product,"I bought this headset mainly for 2 reasons. One is that I prefer the behind the ear type headsets and this one goes on easily and feels comfortable. Secondly, I needed a headset that would sync with 2 devices and it works as promised. I have a work and personal cell phone and I can use one headset for both phones without having to resynchronize.My only complaint about the headset is the very, very small power button. It's sometimes hard to tell if you are pressing it in all the way to turn it on/off."
4,extremely pleased,This was a Christmas gift for our son. He was so happy and pleased. The service was good and the price was GREAT!
5,LOVE IT,I love the Plantronics Voyager 510. It keeps a charge a very long time. The sound quality is excellent. I particularly like the IN ear feature. That is why the sound is so good. People I speak with don't know if I am on the bluetooth or on the phone. I use this device with Palm Treo 650. Works for me!
4,great headset...,"This is my first bluetooth headset, but the reception & the battery life are great. I can hear clearly & everyone I speak with can hear me clearly. I only have a couple of suggestions:1. There should be a better range of volume.2. There should be an indicator somewhere on the headset to determine how much battery life remains.The only other comment is that the power button is slightly awkward. I would consider purchasing another Plantronics headset based on this one."
1,Do any of these wireless headsets actually work?,"Purchased this headset because of all the positive reviews and paired it with my Motorola E815. So much for that. The call quality was horrible. The audio was all distorted and would constantly break up, and forget about using it outside, picks up all the wind noise and drowns out my conversation. I'm going back to using my Plantronics wired headset until someone makes a wireless headset that actually does what it's supposed to do. Work!"
1,Blue tooth head set,This was not what I had expected it hurt my ear to wear it.... and then it all of a sudden stopped working..... I think they could make it better so that it don't hurt the inside of your ear while wearing it.. I will not buy another one like this.... I have the one that fits over your ear now and it is very comfortable you don't even know your wearing it unlike the plantonic's voyager....
3,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth,"The headset is light and fits well in the ear, however the sound quality is average with increased static as the headset loses its charge."
4,Great purchase.,"No problems with Macbook, OS X.4 using Skype. Easy to set up and easy to use. Macbook is a little slow to find it sometimes."
4,Good Solid Performance.,"Fits in my ear on the right better than left. Reception is good, no problems on other side of call understanding me. There is a 2-3 second delay when answering a call, but it is only a nuisance. Battery tends to deplete requiring daily recharge. I do recommend this product."
1,I Learned to NOT Purchase Electronics Online EVER Again,"I was sold a defective bluetooth headset. And yes, I am absolutely positive that its the bluetooth headset, not me. I used to work for an indirect representative for Cingular, T-Mobile, Sprint (together with Nextel), Surewest, Verizon and Helio. I have seen my fair share of bluetooth headsets and have paired them to a number of phones for customers. This headset would not go into the pairing mode. So now, I'm stuck with a defective (perhaps even used or refurbished) piece of junk. ""Do a manufacturer's warranty claim"" you may say to yourself aloud? But for what? To waste even more time and money (postage) that I can't afford. No thanks, for now on, I'm sticking to purchasing electronics out of a store, with person to person responsibility and customer service. Lesson learned."
1,refund,good afternoon until now they do not understand me that I buy 1 loudspeaker and free hands and single have given back the money to me of the loudspeakers and that never I do not arrive at my hands the other product nor have given back my good money either to me no longer I write but or lose the money and please does not return to me to send supplies of their products so that I am disappointed of this completes purchase thanks for everything.
1,Worst ordering experience,"I ordered this headset from AMAZON and it was delivered to someone else in a city other than my own. I emailed them to see what was going on and then they blew me off by saying, ""Please sir just wait until the order date commitment is lapsed, then contact us if you still have not obtained your product."" Very non-proactive. To add spite to me, they then charged me again for this product. HORRIBLE! Never order from AMAZON themself. ORder from another company. I ordered 3 other things after I ordered this headset and they arrived correctly to me and not to someone else in a timely manner.PB"
4,This is the one to get,"I bought my Plantronics 510 after having tried a similarly priced Motorola bluetooth headset. I returned the Moto, which had the inferior design of sitting outside the ear; this type will never have sufficient volume, don't bother with it. The best thing about the Plantronics 510: it comes with three interchangeable earbuds so you can custom fit it to your particular ear size for maximum comfort. The sound is so good with the 510 that callers often don't know you're even on a handsfree. The only gripe I can find is the on/off control is too close to the volume control and it's easy to confuse the two when wearing the unit. Beyond that, this is the one!"
3,Great Volume,"If you have problems hearing this is for you.I have tried several, this is the best of the lot.The only problem I have is I get a weak signal notice many times, I don't know if it's the headset or my phone (razor)."
4,Great Buy,"I tried various headsets of different brands, some more expensive, some less. My main requirement was that the person on the other end couldn't tell I was on a bluetooth headset. This was the winner. The mic is the best I tried, and the earphone quality is better than par. I can get about 20-25 feet from my phone (HTC wizard) before quality begins to degrade. That is farther than many other headsets got me. This Jabra style design is the most comfortable to wear. I go many hours without even thinking about it being on my ear. I didn't expect to use the multipoint (use it with 2 phones) much when I purchased it, but it is really nice when also using a cell phone at work, or even out with my wife and her phone. It may not be the sexiest thing you can buy, but function wins over form here. All around a top notch headset!Why not 5 stars? Bluetooth technology itself is far from perfect."
3,I expected more,"The headset is comfortable and usually sends the correct commands to the phone. In addition, it is very comfortable on the ear. The problem that I have is not being able to hang up from a call. Lets say that I am in the car and the phone is either in my pocket or in the dash and I make a call but the name is not identified correctly. The phone calls the wrong number and there is no way to hang up without opening up the phone and doing this on the phone. The has almost cause accidents."
5,Believe it! Ultimate in wireless freedom,"Look no further. Just as the product description states, ""For the ultimate in wireless freedom"". The Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset, does represent a generational leap in Bluetooth headset technology.It is extremely light weight, comfortable and the sound quality is unprecedented in the market place today."
4,Great for first few months...,"This worked very well for the first few months I owned it. I used it with my notebook and my cell phone without any issues. Calls were clear, I was told that I was audible, and I was very pleased.Recently however I have been having trouble pairing it with my cell phone. I do not know if the problem is the earpiece or my cell phone, but it requires me to turn my cell phone on and off a few times before they pair successfully.[...] stars if not for this recent issue (even though the issue my be my cell phone). I would still recommend this for someone looking for quality."
4,A Trucker's Opinion,"I'm a trucker and it's important that I have a quality earphone. This one does the trick even in my noisy environment. It takes a moment to adjust it to fit properly but it stays put and sounds great. I have a Blackberry Pearl and it paired with the earphone easily. The flashing light took some getting used to, but I'm pleased with it overall."
4,More than happy...except,"This is the first Bluetooth headset that I have owned. It works wonderfully. I have very good range with my phone (Motorola). In fact, I can go to a different floor in the house or outside before realizing I did not have my phone with me. It has very clear sound quality, and it does reduce the background noise (at least compared to the Scala). It stays connected. It is easy to use and easy to switch from left to right. This headset would be fantastic, EXCEPT for the simple fact that I could not get it to fit. It has nothing to do with the ear pieces, but everything to do with the fit around the back of my ear. The height of the curvature was too tall to fit my ear and cannot be adjusted. Consequently, it caused great frustration with every use because it just would not stay put. I ended up trading with a friend. He now has mine and it works great for him. No problems at all. I now have his (Scala), which does fit, but in my opinion, does not perform as well."
4,very useful,The product is of good quality and noise reduction is excellent. The only trouble is the size. its bit big. Other than that it serves the purpose. The seller is good and i received it very fast.
4,Great for trucks too!,the plantronics 510 works well even in big trucks.The noise cancelling works well so you can hear and be heard pretty well.You can easily be 15-20 feet away and still stay connected with clear reception to handset.A good choice in bluetooth headsets.
1,awfuly bulky,I did not like this earpeice it was huge and kept falling off my ear I gave it to my grandma shes happy with it.
2,Not for Skype,This may be a perfectly fine headset but I bought it thinking that I would be able to use it with skype. It does not work with a computer.
1,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth,"Matches fine with Asus EEE PC 1000, but sits and does absolutely nothing on Skype for example...I purchased the Plantronics Voyager 510 because it doesn't have any wires to break from their constant flexing...I did not care that it is mono, not stereo, I wanted it to use with Skype.It is possible that there is some complicated way that only a true geek can figure out to make it work with my Asus....I have neither the time or the interest to pursue...I wish I had not listened to all the hype and just stuck with my old IBM T23 / XP SP3 and ""Antivir"" free antivirus,which works perfect and definitely does not have all the problems these 2 electronic devices have"
2,you get what you pay for,"Compared to smaller models out there, this one is quite bulky & cumbersome. The weight acutally presses into your year & can get painful after a while. Eventually you will get used to it, but not for the tone that comes out of nowhere to let you know you're now disconnected. You haven't moved, the phone hasn't moved, yet you are now disconnected. I bought this on a budget to replace my lost Blue Ant. Then I said screw the budget & went & got another Blue Ant."
2,dose not work with I phone,"Good, easy to use worked fine with my old handset... I recently bought I-Phone... This is usless now.. This has bluetooth v 1.1, This dose not work with I-Phone !!"
4,Works well,"Aside from the power switch being in an akward spot (which i knew before buying this product) this headset for the money is very good. It might look a little goofy when on, but its comfort makes up for style."
5,Great Earpiece,I bought this like a month and a half ago. The sound is clear and it's easy to use. The instructions are very easy to understand and I use it all the time. It's lightweight. I have small ears so I was afraid that the piece would not fit in my ear. It has 3 different sizes and the smallest one fits my ear perfectly. This is a great Product.
4,Hands free Bluetooth,"I would give this Plantronics Voyager 510 a 5 star, butI have nothing to compair it with.I have used this bluetooth for several months now and have no complaints. the device fits nicely behind the ear and I removed the ear bud so nothing sticks in your ear.The Plantronics Voyager 510 device stays firmely in place as you move about doing your workThe charge time lasts longer than my cell phone, so I charge them at the same time and Iam ready to go."
3,NIce but still but,"I like the style the way they make it, and it look strong and dependable with a good spec, but i guess, it just only work for people that don't wear a glasses cause it will make u not comfortable and will sting u.. and everytime u turn off, it look like restart so you had to do the pairing again.. again.. en again.. so just used to it.. ok that's all"
1,Not for use outside,"I returned this item because I was looking for a headset that I could use while outside, particularly on urban streets. This is not a good product for that type of use. The people I called could barely hear me and if there was the slightest wind it was impossible to have a conversation. I'm still looking for a good headset for this type of use but so far no luck."
4,Solid enough,"The Voyager 510 is my first experience with a Bluetooth headset. Been using it the last couple of months; ever since California instituted its ""Hands-Free"" law on July 1, 2008.Has been working pretty well overall. Fits reasonably well to my ears. Can be fitted on either ear with the swivel action.A minor complaint would be that the sound quality could be a little better. But not bad though.Hard to go wrong with this choice."
3,"Good at first, but sound quality deteriorates over time","When I first bought this headset, I was pretty satisfied. It handled voice dialing with my Nokia well, and the sound quality was generally good on both ends. The over-the-ear receiver was comfortable and didn't fall off.However, it has exhibited two shortcomings. First, the size is rather awkward. It doesn't fit inside my cell phone case with the phone like my previous headsets would. Second, the sound quality, especially on the receiving end, deteriorated over a few months.This seems to be a very common problem with bluetooth headsets. I've had three different headsets that started out good, but after roughly six months became unintelligible on receiving side. I'm guessing it's something to do with the microphone.Fortunately, this one is cheap enough that replacing it is just an annoyance and not a mahor cost hit."
2,Headset is cumbersome to use,Power button is awkward to access and must be held for three seconds to power unit on. Ear piece is not comfortable. I would not recommend this headset.
1,Unhappy with Plantronics Voyager 510. Replaced with Motorola H500,"I fail to understand the high ratings for this headset. I dislike it.While sound quality was quite good, there are several physical attributes that made it less appealing to me.Even with the smallest earpiece, it is uncomfortable in the ear canal. It is bulky, and awkward when worn with eyeglasses or sunglasses. The power switch is difficult to use as well. I can't really think of anything I like about it.I thought it was a decent price at $42, but the $28 Motorola H500 is a no-brainer when compared to this headset."
1,Not Compatable,When I was buying this item...I was not told that this item is not compatable with my Sprint/Samsung Cell phone..It initiall worked for only one time..and it never worked after that..When I tried Plantronics...they told me that this head set is not compatable with my cell phone..they asked me to try with another phone..(I have not got a chance to do that yet)..and told me that if it doesnt work for another phone I can retun it...
3,Not worth the price!,"I bought it for $45, the LED on the bluetooth stopped working after 1month - so whenever i have to pair it with a cellphone, i have to assume that 3seconds have passsed and it is in the pairing mode now.Also, it does not fit very well on the ear, and a lot of times i have to hold it inside my ear while driving if even light music is being played in the background.The piece that covers the microphone on the BT device (thru which sound penetrates into the device) fell down - which you would not expect from a plantronics equipment.Sound quality is good in a silent room & battery life is good too.This is my 2nd plantronics BT headset and both have had quite a few cons.I would suggest you to buy a jabra or motorola for the same price."
4,Good if you keep your windows up.,"Good product, easy to use. Like most others you have to keep your windows up and watch out for back ground noise."
2,Comfy but has serious mechanical & connection issues,"Pros & Cons-Earpiece is comfortable but fell off too easily and is now lost. (I didn't know they even CAME off)-The on/off button is very resistant and required two thumbs pressing VERY hard to activate.-Very slow to sync with phone after answering call. 1-3 seconds of delay is enough for callers to give up and hang up.-It's got a big butt, but still comfy to wear.-I will be ordering another 220."
2,fast delivery but product sucks,I received the bluetooth pretty fast but i am dissappointed with the quality of sound of the product.
2,Lots of Static,"This is my second voyager 510. The first one I had was great, but the charge wasn't lasting anymore, so I ordered this as a replacement....very disappointed with the clarity of the unit. Lots of static in the background on my end. People on other end don't seem to hear it, so I just deal with it."
1,Forget it,"Being a skeptic, I didn't believe the bad reviews and purchased one. I sent it back. No one could hear me in a quiet room, never mind in my car, which was the whole point. I'm not a quiet speaker, in fact I tend to raise my voice without realizing it. My callers could not hear me, I couldn't hear them. Don't waste your time and money."
3,Works very well with PS3,I bought this headset as a replacement to my existing Motorola headset. I've tried two different Motorola headsets with my PS3 and they always have problems. This headset is very cost efficient and works perfect with the PS3. I'm very happy I got it.
4,"It works well and the price is good, but there are a few nits","Sound quality is good, the earpiece is moderately comfortable and the bluetooth is solid. Downsides: the power adapter is non standard and for us technology geeks this means yet another power adapter we have to carry around. If it had a USB style power connector that would be better. The back piece is a little on the big side and can be somewhat uncomfortable, although I am sure that is more of an individual fit and preference thing as opposed to anything else. I am sure there are some for whom the fit is excellent."
5,Works fine,"This bluetooth headset works fine and has as good or better sound quality than when I am using my handset. I use it for both my work cellphone and my personal cellphone, and found that it is pretty easy to switch it between those two devices.Battery life has been fine, I usually charge it about 2 times a week and leave it on all the time, but only talk on it for about 8-10 hrs. per week.There have been a couple of glitches, but nothing to lower my rating. Once it continued flashing red (""charging"") while on the charger for several hours. I removed it from the charger and put it back on, and it changed to solid blue (""charged"") after about 4 red blinks. Once I had to turn it off then on to get my phone to connect to it. But that's about it, and I've been using it constantly for about 4 months."
2,Good for the first 4 months...,"I don't know if the life span of this device is under 6 months... I bought it and worked ok for the first 4 months... then suddenly the headset stop charging its internal battery... So it becomes useless.I don't live in the US, so it was cheaper to throw the headset to the trash and buy a new one (no more plantronics for me)."
5,Fabulous headset,"I have used and tried several of the bluetooth headsets and resigned myself to the idea that I would never find one that is sufficiently loud to be used at highway speeds, I was wrong.This is the highest rated bluetooth headset on Amazon for a reason, it has the best sound and voice clarity, period.It may not look the ""coolest"" but it more than gets the job done.Great stand by and talk time as well."
5,Works great with just about any phone.,"BEST BUY if you are looking for a professional looking Bluetooth Headset. No if's or but's. I've been using this product for about 5 months now and love it. Since then, I've suggested this product to several friends and familiy members and they love it as well. Overall, with all the people combined, this product has been used on several different phones and so far it's worked seamlessly on every phone. If you wear a headset at work because of your work phone, you can buy the adapter which is about $100, and this 510 headset can be used at work as well. Instructions are simple, easy to follow. Amazon's price was one of the lowest ($50). I would DEFINITELY buy this product again."
2,unwieldy,"I am very disappointed in this product. The sound is not very clear. It falls off my ear frequently. I think this might be better for a very large man, but it definitely is uncomfortable and unwieldy for me. It falls off as I am driving, which creates the hazard it is meant to prevent. And it is a pain to keep asking people to repeat themselves because the sound quality is so iffy."
5,"Good product, good value!","My son has been using it for more than two years and told me that the reception is good. I went to Amazon's website and looked at other latest Plantronics Voyager models, and found that the prices are more expensive but feedbacks from other consumers are not any better. I also found that Plantronics Voyager 510 was on sale, so I bought one for myself in mid November; however, when I bought another one as gift in December, the price has gone up! No matter what, it's still worth the price (sale) as the reception is good and the earpiece is comfortable. You won't regret once you bought it. You will get your money worth."
5,Great for tiny ears!,"I was in the market for a headset that fit my very small ears. Not only are my ear canals very small (I have a hard time fitting in a q-tip) but the outer portion is only and inch and a half long from top to bottom. Because of this, no headset would grasp the outside of my ear and there is no earbud made on this planet that will fit inside my canal. I did some research and found this. The bulky back end wraps around my tiny ears and holds it very firmly into place. And the earbud fits snugly just inside my ear but stops before it gets to the canal. For the first time in my life, I can wear a bluetooth and move about without worrying about it falling out! The sound is great (though it does have a bit of static) and people can really hear me on the other end! Great great product!"
4,this is my first bluetooth,"I gave this a four star rating because it's my first bluetooth headset. I've had no problems with it, I actually bought two, one for my girlfriend and me. She's had them before and needed a new one, so I bought two. Neither of us have had a single issue, they work just as advertised. I'm happy with it, I don't use it all that much, my girlfriend loves her's."
4,Works well with Treo 650,I've had this for a month working with my Treo 650 and it works well. Call clarity is good as well as headset functions interacting with Treo.
2,I had to return this item,This item is little over weight so it's pain to keep always over the ear. Also I had complaints about static many times during calls.
5,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,"It's easy to use, can be adjusted to fit either ear, and the battery lasts a good while between charges."
4,Great product!,"I am very happy with this product.Pros: clear reception (both receiving and speaking), attractive design, long battery life, mostly easy to useCons: somewhat annoying to put on ear and in the process of adjusting the ear piece, I have accidentally hung up on several people (placement of the connect button).Overall, this is a smart purchase, especially for this price range."
3,"Not so good, not so bad","I bought this earpiece becuase of all the good reviews that I read about it. Even though it's more expensive than the other cheaper motorola earpieces, I still got it because I prefer quality over cost. I gotta say that it's not all that good(as stated in all those reviews. I mean, I had no problems hooking it up with my motorola phone, that was all easy. Where I don't like it very much is the reception. I constantly hear static(crackling noise) unless I have the phone right next to me, which is about 1 1/2ft to 2ft. I'm thinkin I should have just gone with the cheaper motorola earpieces instead, not to mention they look A LOT BETTER."
4,Somewhat Awesome,"This is the first bluetooth headset I've owned and I am very satisfied. It is a little bulky compared to others, however It is very comfortable and I have yet to have a complaint from anyone I've held a phone conversation with using the headset. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality headset at a reasonable price. It is a little difficult to turn on and off while wearing due to the way the power switch is positioned. Other than that it rocks."
3,"Fine form, but the voice quality is lacking","Despite a bunch of reviews being wowed, I found the voice quality on this headset too bad for enjoyable conversations. It might get the job done for people looking for wind-blocking, but sitting in my house, I couldn't have a chatty conversation without straining to hear through the cheap digital sound. In addition, I believe the link wasn't duplex, meaning I could either talk or listen, but I couldn't do both. Perhaps this works for people conferencing, but for a personal chat, it was disappointing."
2,sorry,"worked like a charm for 2 months.. then for no reason stopped working and would not power up.. no reason, no trauma to product.. do not recommend"
3,Bulky Bluetooth,"Plantronics makes good products, but this one didn't work for me. The 510 is too bulky, with an awkward fit. And the controls are too small for my fingers. Good product, but it just didn't work for me."
2,Not load enough!,The only good thing about this set was that it's comfortable to wear and that's it. Buttons are small and hard to press and it doesn't go load enough to hear in the car. Returned it and bought a Blue Ant Z9 and boy what a difference!Buy the Blue Ant the first time and be happy!
3,Analyst for CGI,This product reduct the noise but the unit only holds a charge for about 30 to 45 mins. Sent the unit back to Man. for repair over a week ago.
2,Didn't live up the hype,Buttons were very hard to push and hard to navigate around when driving. It wasn't nearly as comfortable as I thought it would/should be.
2,Keep looking,"I have yet to find a bluetooth headset that is worth using.I found this to be fairly comfortable to wear, but the sound quality was so-so. The sound quality was ok if i was very close (5 ft.) to the bluetooth host. Most people i spoke to said that they could hear me but i sounded like i was under water. I also found the sound of other peoples voices to be muffled and significantly worse than the speaker in my Moto Razr.But the quality dropped fairly quickly.... around 10 ft. the signal degraded and at 15ft it was unusable.I have better freedom of movement with the desktop microphone i currently use.If you are using this so that you can use your mobile phone handsfree, you might be ok with it.But if you want to use it for skype, you are better off with a wired microphone sitting on your desk like this one:Logitech Desktop Microphone (980240-0403)(note that you need to use that microphone with a powered microphone port or else it will be too quite)"
2,"Folks, ask the person on the other end...","This headset does not deserve its high rating. For 2 years I've also thought that it's been a great set, but I forgot it at home recently while charging it and found out otherwise. ""Are you calling from home today? You sound so much more clear than usual."" (I was holding my Blackberry up to my ear without using the 510.) Needless to say, I'm searching for a replacement for my tired 510. Do yourself and your other party a favor: test with/without the 510 engaged. You'll probably find that your beloved headset sounds wonderful to you, but doesn't get the job done outgoing."
2,OK,"I did not try many of these products, but I based this one on the reviews. It is OK, but should be a $20 price tag since it constantly disconnents and hard to use. Not impressed."
4,"ok battery life, nice fit in my ear.","I had SONY/MOTOROLA bluetooth headset, but Plantronics comes out to be the best one so far. The battery life is longer, connect is more stable, voice are much more clear. (Thanks to the noise reduction?)However, the + - and power buttons are too small. Hard to press on/off. While talking, you sometimes will hear a split second sharp noise from the background.GOOD! but can be better! Although it's already a 4 stars compare to others."
4,"Good product, too much interference on Bluetooth","I thought I could finally ""cut the cord"" on my hour long conference calls with this, and it is a good product that works and is relatively easy to setup (compared to other Bluetooth headsets I've had). Unfortunately it has an annoying, slight buzzing noise in the background of calls I make in my office. I believe it's picking up interference from the multitude of other electronics I have setup.It does work well with my cell phone though."
4,Good Product,It is not the most attractive blue tooth device but if you are more concerned about function than form it is exceptional. The sound quality is great for both the user and the party on the other end.
4,"Superior bluetooth, small problem","Well, My item did not come with instructions which sucked makes me wonder of my unit was new or not, it said it was new, but it works fine I cannot walk very far from my phone thought it will immediately get statically i can walk maybe 10 -12 feet away before I get all static. Beyond that i think it is eXcellent for the low price and over all I am very satisfied. Good Buy, excellent price."
3,Elegant but...,"There are many problems with the buttons: Power button is too small and it doesn't feedback well when you press it. The same happens with the call button. Not all the functionalities works as said in manual, some of them works sometimes and sometimes not. Some functionalities are not well described on the manual, therefore you have to call to Helpdesk.A very inmature product"
2,Not good enough....,"When I received the product kind of ok,But after I used for couple of days.The charging was getting over in like 30 min so I have put it away since reshiping back would not work for themoney which I bought which is $35 bucks."
3,not bad,I rated it three because for the kind of usage I do cannot justify the quality of the product. I use this only while driving daily to office and back to home. At the most daily usage is 2 hours. Hence it is very difficult to write or justify about all the pros & cons. Since the usage is less the battery lasts very long. Since I bought this I did recharge only once. Sound quality also looks fine except did observe static while driving thru higher elevations.
4,Great sound quality; but a bit bulky,I am pleased with the Voyager 510 Bluetooth headset. It is a bit bulky to wear especially if you have on eyeglasses or sunglasses. However I would not hesitate to purchase this headset again because it has a very good sound quality.
5,Plantronics Voyager 510 Headset,I am still using this product even a year and change later. It still works well and have had no problems. Was even easy to link up to both my motorola v557 phone & my motorola razr v3. Voice is nice & clear and people can actually hear me too! Awesome product!
5,People hear me better thru the headset than the cell phone,"After reading reviews of various bluetooth products on Amazon.com, I settled on this Plantronics headset, and I have been very happy with it. The device does everything I expected it to do. It fits well, and I can wear it for several hours before it starts to bother my ear, and then I just move the parts and switch ears. In my experience, it has great battery life. I can usually get 6-8 hours of talk time out of it when it's been fully charged. I have been told by numerous people that they can actually hear me much better (almost no problems at all) when I am using the headset. (I have a lot of static and dead air when using my cingular,sony erricsson by itself in my home.) The only complaint other people have about it is the headset's sensitivity to outside noise, especially wind noise when outside. I have not yet set up voice command, so I can't comment on that aspect. Overall, I am very impressed with this product and highly recommend it."
4,Great Fitting Headset That You Can Also Hear!!!,"After having Motorolas, I was slightly discouraged about BlueTooth headset technology. I made a (poor) assumption all brands would be similar in sound. My Motorolas were very difficult to hear, so much so that I wouldn't even use it for driving (the main reason for gettinig it). I was recommended the Voyager 510 by a co-worker. This headset is plenty loud to hear while driving even with radio turned up and A/C fans on high. The noise cancellation mic is quite good as well. Its a very comfortable headset for having an ear insert.4 our of 5 stars because of the power button and volume controls. They are quite small and if wearing the headset, they are a little difficult to find behind your ear."
2,Not as good as expected,"I bought the 510 based on the volume of positive reviews. Well if this truly is the best bluetooth headset then I'm going back to using a wired headset. Sound quality was poor, people couldn't hear me if there was any background noise and the ear pieces were all uncomfortable."
4,"Good buy, I recommend",I saw that the item had very good reviews and decided it to give it a try. Definetely a different design but it is not too bad. Sound quality is very good and volume is great. Much better than my previous headset. If you are looking for a headset with high volume and good quality I recommend this one. It comes with different ear plugs to fit each person.So far no complaints. It is a big more expensive that other headsets but I think it is worth
3,Voyager 510 is the best of the lot,"This is now the 4th Bluetooth headset I've purchased trying to find one that's decent. This one has been the best. The sound quality is good according to the folks I'm talking to, it actually stays in my ear, which many don't, battery life seems good, and the controls are easy to operate. Looks like I'm done buying new ones for awhile."
2,Not my favorite bluetooth device...,"After using this device, I really find it's too big to be comfortable. I can hear and be heard well enough, but there is an annoying tendency for the connection to drop for no apparent reason between the device and my phone (an AT&T Sony Ericsson W350a). Additionally, the only button on it that still works is the connect/disconnect button on the side of the boom. The others on the back of the device are broken, even though I've hardly touched them. I would not buy another one of these devices."
3,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,"Pretty decent headset for the price. I wear it all day and the sound quality is very good, and comfortable to wear."
5,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,"I had this headset before and I loved it. I had it for a long time however it finally started getting really hard to charge as the point of entry was getting pushed in and the charger wasn't making contact.It's comfortable, affordable and people sound fine on it and I believe I sound fine to them too!"
2,muffled,"I read all these reviews for this earpiece and had great hopes for it. the LG I tried a couple of years ago had really poor sound quality and was very uncomfortable, so I've stayed away from bluetooth headsets. When I read the reviews on the 510 I thought this has got to be better. Well while the headset is very comfortable, the sound is very muffled. I'm returning mine. If you decide to order one I hope you have better luck."
1,Replacement is HORRIBLE,"I purchased my first Voyager 510 approximately 18 months ago and unfortunately lost it in a grocery store parking lot. The second replacement (ordered from here)- no one could hear me - the sound was muffled, choppy - almost as if the noise cancellation was hyper-active. I read a review on here that Plantronics had permitted some lemons to get loose on the market. So shame on me.. I ordered a third one, thinking that the odds of my getting another lemon would be fairly astronomical.Well.... I'm not going for the ""some lemons"" theory now. Plantronics had an excellent product and they have mucked it up. I'm beginning to think it is a case of planned obsolescence. I have a friend who still has their original - still works great and has no reason to replace it. Plantronics will make money from this model as long as the Amazon ratings stay high..even though the ones they are manufacturing now are junk."
2,Meh...,"I lost my old headset (different model) so I started looking for a new one. I purchased this headset because I read good reviews on it, and it's highly rated by Consumer Reports. I find it to be uncomfortably large. I need to use both hands to put it on or else it falls off. The sound quality is fine as long as it's no more than two feet away from my phone. So if I'm wearing my phone on my hip (like I usually do) both ends of the call are static-ey and tends to break up. It works fine when I'm driving due to where I place my phone. I would not purchase this one again."
1,Get the older version,Earpiece has multiple places that it breaks/comes apart. I superglued it twice but finally the wires inside gave way. I would recommend getting the older version of the Bluetooth as it will last longer and the sound quality is better.
2,Good while it lasted,"I purchased the Platronics 510 after I lost a Jabra Bluetooth unit earlier this year. After charging it up it worked well for about a week and then it failed to hold a charge for any length of time, if at all. I was also disappointed with the earpiece. The Jabra was almost twice the price but it worked very well, had great distance and multiple soft rubber earpieces. When I tried to exchange the Platronics for a new unit their customer service claimed they had not yet released the model and implied that I had obtained it ""inappropriately"". After 30 minutes and a discussion with her supervisor it was determined that it had been released and Amazon was indeed a legitimate source. They had a rather complicated return process so I gave up on Plantronics and returned the earpiece to Amazon for a refund."
1,Plantronics Voyager 510,"I had an earlier model of this headset for several years that I would still be using if I hadn't lost it. I tried a Motorola headset next but found that it was uncomfortable to wear for any period of time and I had to turn the volume up to hear. Well, I lost that headset as well. I'm now back to Plantronics and won't leave again. It's comfortable so I sometimes forget that I have it on and the sound quality is great. Just hope I don't lose this one as well.update december 9, 2010. don't let headset completely lose it's charge. if you do, you won't be able a recharge it. plantronics honored the warranty and replaced with a refurb unit. fine, except i misplaced headset in house for a couple of days (yeah, i misplace things a lot. i'm old - go figure.) it lost charge and i had another dead unit. went with a jawbone and no problems since."
3,Good when it worked,"When it worked it did a fine job, good sound quality, good battery life, able to toggle between two bluetooth sources (ie phone and laptop).However, I had to return this headset to Plantronics four times before I was finally sent a headset that worked for a number of months. Yesterday I dropped that one, now it doesn't charge.Will certainly be looking at other manufacturers products now I'm having to replace this. Build quality's terrible"
5,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth with Sanyo Kantana Dlx,"I tried a few other brands and models and this one has beaten them all for comfort, performance and ease of use! Although it doesn't totally eliminate background or wind noise, it's very acceptable. The sound quality of this Bluetooth is excellent. It's easy to answer or place a call even with a gloved mitten. I've used this under a heavy winter hat and it doesn't become painful when under a snug band, even though the ear bud fits right into the ear canal. Very comfortable in all weather. I usually forget I have it on. Bravo, Plantronics!"
3,Voyager 510 Review,I found that this bluetooth had great sound. I also loved the fact that you could sync this with 2 different phones at the same time for use. The only problem I had with it was that the ear pieces did not fit in my ear very well.
4,Good Bluetooth Headset,"A little bigger than I expected, but still a nice size and works very well.I haven't had any problems. Hooked right up to my phone no problem."
3,Good built,I bought this for my hubby less than an year ago. HE liked the shape and th fit. IT is very convenient to wear. But has already started giving problems.
5,Best Bluetooth Headset,I work in an extremely noisy enviroment. Everyone says they can hear me the best on this headset over the MANY others I've tried. I can also hear them over the wind and background noise of driving a truck and working on the dock. My 1st one lasted over 1 1/2 yrs and survived many drops. Best product for noisy enviroments.
3,"A bit bulky, but it works","A bit bulky, but it works without a hitch. Pairing was fairly easy and it works with all of the cell phones I've got. Sound is good and volume is easily controlled. Picks up voice pretty well with minimum wind noise. All in all not a bad headset for the money."
3,"Works fine, has a custom charger","The unit works fine, but has a custom charging connection which if I would have have noticed before buying, I wouldn't have gotten it. I'm a big fan of Mini and Micro USB connections, not what this has."
3,Good overall,Truck drivers seem to like this model because reception with the noise filtering works better than the more sensitive models. Good value for the price!
3,"performs well, but lacks durability","This is my third Plantronics bluetooth. I actually bought this same model twice, because it seems like one needs to be in transit back and forth with Plantronics, getting replaced under warranty. Sound quality and battery seem fine, but I've only got about 4 months at a time out of the device, before something breaks."
2,Voyager 510 with Motorola V710,"The 510 headset is wonderful - lightweight, convenient, and easy to synch to the Motorola V710.But the quality of the voice when using it is marginal. I can hear callers just fine, but often they can't hear me very well and they tell me it sounds muffled. I use my phone for business all the time, and stopped using it except for personal calls on long trips. I'm not sure whether it's a Plantronics problem, or Motorola, but I am dissappointed."
4,Lasted exactly an year,I bought this last July right here on Amazon. I was very pleased with the headset from the outset. It had a great fit and did not hurt my ear lobes from constantly wearing them. I used to have a motorola headset before this one and I would have to constantly take it out once in a while because of the poor fit around my ears. The voyager 510 also is very good when having a conversation when driving or even in moderately windy conditions (outside).What has stopped me from giving 5 stars is the plastic housing has started to come off after just about a year of usage (this is the part that is curved and goes onto the back of your ear). I have not abused it and only used it when I am driving and while at work and need to take a personal call. Other than this it has been working great.
3,Not as good as I remembered...,"This is the second one I've owned. I loved my first one, but after a lot of wear and tear over a 2 year period, the quality was going down, and people couldn't hear me well. So I purchased a second. Unfortunately, it seems the quality of these has gone down since my original purchase. I'm using it with an iPhone 3Gs and I can't go more than 5 feet away without experiencing crackle and bad reception. But this is still the most comfortable ear piece I have ever worn. I often forget it's on my head for hours at a time!Overall, I wish I could exchange it for one $20 more for much better quality."
5,Best Bluetooth headset I've had yet.,"When it came, my first impression, as I took it out of the box, was that it seemed big, but that's mostly because of its configuration being mostly behind the ear. I've been pleased with this device as it's extremely comfortable to use for extended periods of time and seems very secure on my head. Performance-wise, it's got very good sounding audio, both directions. This is my second Plantronics Bluetooth headset and I've also got a wired Plantronics earbud for my Blackberry. It seems to be a brand I can trust to give me consistently good results. Highly recommended."
3,just ok,"i received super fast 2 days with student prime, the unit is very comfortable. problem is that so far just about every call has high amounts of static, not good. i have only worn it since this morning and some calls static is unbearable."
5,Platronics Voyager 510 an excellent bluetooth headset,"This bluetooth is fantastic, it looks big aparently but is light in weight and sits on my ear very easily. reception is very good with no noise to the person on the other side. I got a very good deal on Amazon. Overall an excellent product."
1,Not what I had hoped for,"Since July 07, I've had two of these headsets. The first one seemed fine at first, but then I slowly began getting complaints that I sounded muffled. After reading through some reviews, it seemed that there was a batch of lemons out there, so I gave this headset another shot. Again, after only a few months the muffled complaint arose. The volume button also broke, and the rubber started peeling away. It's too bad, because I'd really like this headset if it would continue to work. I would not recommend this headset."
4,Great buy.,"This model works perfectly, far better than what I expected for what I spent. The sound quality is great, (even better than my phone)and it neatly fits into your pocket. Also, the voice command feature gives you control to make phone calls without even touching your phone. The only drawback are the controls. It is a bit cumbersome to access the volume buttons and on/off switch when the device is plugge into your ear."
2,"Fine, when there's no static.","I am very disappointed with this product. I bought it to use with my Treo 650. The sound is terrible. I can barely hear any speech over all the static. Of course, the static goes away when I switch to the phone's own speaker."
4,Functional and an Improvement,"I've had three headsets and this is by far the best. It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous. My only concern is when I have to keep it in my pocket. It has some bulk and I'm afraid it will bend in such a way that it breaks. It needs a carrying case - I've read the reviews of the case and it's not recommended."
4,super sound and comfort,"I use a Motorola phone and had bought one of these last year. In my travels, this past summer, I lost it and had to buy another. This product has great sound and comfort for me. People rarely can tell I am on a headset, even in noisy environments. I have also used it in dual pairing mode with my home office phone. No headset wires on my desk!"
4,Plantronics Voyager 510,"I like everything about this Bluetooth except one thing or I would have given it a 5 star. I don't like the postion of the on/off switch which is a slightly above the volume control and seems cumbersume to activate when it is around your ear, other than that this is the best bluetooth I have owned. The ear piece has differant adaptors to fit the shape of your ear, and the sound is Chrystal clear"
3,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,"I can hear the other person fine on this and it seems to have good battery life and connectivity. However, here are the comments I've received so far, from 3 different people while I was using this headset:""You sound distant""""I can tell you're using a headset""""Are you in a bathroom?"" (I was in my kitchen)"
4,Quite good,"This is lightweight and comfortable and the sound is the best I have heard from a bluetooth, and I have owned several. My only criticism is that it even a small breeze creates wind noise for the person to whom I'm speaking."
3,Overall good purchase,"For the price (paid less than $30)this is a pretty good headset. The audio quality is not that great. Not much on the lower frequencies, sounding a bit like talking thru an older model telephone. The other feature I don't like is the on/off switch. It's too small making it hard to activate. As for the positive side, I like the way the ear piece fits comfortably in the ear and provides plenty of volume. Unlike the Motorola headsets that just sit over the ear, the 510 wraps around the back in a comfortable way and the earpiece helps to balance the weight on the ear so the headset becomes barely noticable when worn."
4,Awesome,This is my 3rd bluetooth and by far the best. People I've called usually can't tell the difference if i'm on it or not. The only thing is that it disconnects every now and then (don't know if it's my phone or the headset)
2,Great Product just not reliable,"Great Product - it works really well as far as quality for both hearing and speaking. I was really happy with that.Not Reliable - I am not sure why, or if just mine was defective, but after a couple of weeks it started droping calls back to the phone. It would cut off the bluetooth connection. I send it back for a refund."
3,"Very Clear earpiece, terrible transmission","This is a great indoor unit paired with my Blackberry 8700g. Unfortunately, that does not translate out of doors. I ride the bus frequently and am very much an on-the-go user. The unit is advertised with 'superior noise/wind cancelling technology, noise reduction'. Sure, the noise is reduced...of your own voice! As far as wind/noise reduction goes this unit fails on both counts. I've tested it out with others who complain there is excessive background noise from the wind (even when inside a car with the window open with a light breeze at a stop light). Bottom line: good for indoor use."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"This is my first bluetooth headset, but am very pleased. After reading reviews and doing my research, I came to this one. Very easy to use, and works great. Ordered from Amazon, and had in two days when it was estimated to 5-8!"
4,Superior Bluetooth Headset,"I recently got a Motorola Bluetooth headset in conjunction with my acqusition of a Blackberry phone. The audio quality was lousy, and the ergonomics around my ear were poor. The Plantronics headset is far superior to the MOT one. The rubberized exterior combined with an earbud make the fit secure and comfortable. The resulting audio quality is quite good, except in situations with lots of surrounding noise or high winds (but I don't blame the model of the headset...I think it's inherent in any of them). Only peeves are the one/off button, which is tiny and has to be pressed quite hard to activate, and the battery life, which is okay, but not great.Overall I'm pretty happy with the purchase."
4,Great for the price,"First off, I must say that this is the only bluetooth earpiece i've ever used. So, I don't have much to compare it to. However, reviewing it independently, it is a great headset for the price. As long as you aren't in a noisy environment, you can hear clearly. And, the headset itself seems to pick up voice clearly. It will also pick up other little noises clearly... so be careful where you use it. lol It seems to filter out noises like wind well."
1,MUCH BIGGER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE!!!!,"This is possibly the best headset ever made from an audio standpoint. BUT, GIVE ME BREAK PLANTRONICS!!! WHY don't you quit coming out with marginal models and re-design this so that the BTE unit isn't quite so big and especially long?? This model has been out long enough and only needs to be tweeked a little and shrunk slightly and everyone should buy it!!Your other, much smaller models don't compare in sound quality.So how about the best of both worlds for those of us that have been spoiled by the 510 but can't quite stand the bulk, and it being flipped off our ear by the bottom of the BTE hitting our jacket collar??!!"
2,Great product not so great customer service,It comes down to how they handle returns...It is poor navigation and not user friendly. Which is not a surprise seeing how they would probably not want to make it easy for you to get your money back as opposed to them taking your money.The sad thing is I would like to do an exchange but they don't do that. I would have to do a return and then purchase another product.I already wrote my dissatisfaction at their customer service but they sent me another survey 2 weeks later. So I suppose they are not reading these surveys either.
4,"Comfortable,clear, cool !","After trying a lot of bluetooth headset including Sennheiser, this is the one I found the most comfortable on my ear.The sound quality is excellent.It;s light weight and does not fall off.The battery life is an amazing 8-10 days.Well ,what more could I ask."
4,Works Great!,The Plantronics Voyager 510 is my first Bluetooth that I've had it's comfortable an sounds very good . A good bargin
3,"Sound is good, listener has problems","This is my first bluetooth and based on the amazon reviews, it was really the best compared to the Motorola units. I can hear beautifully with the headset and it is very comfortable, but the person on the other side has a different story. It is a bit staticy, and if I am leaving someone a voice mail message, they cannot always understand me. The static problem may be me, but I can't figure out how to correct it. I have moved the microphone in every direction imagineable, and I think the issue may be because it is too close to my mouth."
4,Pretty good,"Reception is good, it was easy to set up. Only issue was the manual wasn't clear on the set up and I had to go to their web site to get clear instructions. There was a special keystroke to put it in to pairing mode that I did not find in the manual."
1,What a Loser!,I bought this head set after all of the great reviews I read but I've had nothing but problems. The unit doesn't hold a charge through one average length phone call. I found it difficult to keep the unit in my ear while talking. The Ear piece is so bulky that I could not wear glasses or sunglasses while using it. I have wasted my money on this product.
1,Died on me within 30 days,"I bought this product after seeing all the fantastic reviews but I was disappointed when it kept disconnecting from my phone atleast 10 times a day and would never pick up every other call. And the after 25 days, it just died on me. I just printed out an RMA from amazon to return the product. Hope I get my refund."
4,ear pieces don't switch well.,My only complaint is that it is extremely difficult to change the different ear pieces (once you attached one you are pretty much stuck with it). Therefore if you did not attach the right piece it will not sit well in your ear. Otherwise it is a very good product.
3,Love it. Make sure you try it on in store,Technically a great product. Problem is no adjustment for back of ear to center of ear canal... bigger people (me) don't get the volume. Bending it doesn't work.. it just flexes back.
2,"Not a great fit, not particularly smart, heavy.","I bought this product based on consumer reviews posted here. I was not impressed. This unit is too large and doesn't fit me well; I guess I need to try these things on in person. It will not stay on and moves my glasses around. I have a Motorola phone and this device will not perform all the voice commands my old Motorola device would (safety issue for me). I don't recommend this piece for someone with smaller ears, or anyone who wears glasses."
4,New to Technology,"I like my new bluetooth. The only issue that I with the bluetooth is that it do not fix over my ear comfortably. However, the sound is great, and I think it looks cool."
4,Decent Headset Overall,"I bought this headset because the USB port on my phone broke and I was used to using a wired earbud. I read the reviews and it sounded like this was going to be as good as the wired connection. Well, it's not. However, I have tried several other bluetooth headsets, and this one is better than any of the others I tried.As for the wind cancelling technology... that is deceptive. For ME, when the wind blows, I do not hear it in the headset. Yet whoever I am talking to can apparently hear it like they would on any other headset. I'm not sure how this works really, but it seems that this actually causes me more problems in windy conditions, as I don't realize that the wind noise is bad, but the person on the other end can't hear me. Still, this is a minor complaint. Talk time on the headset is great, and quality is very good as well. If there is a better headset out there, I haven't found it yet."
4,Pretty Good Device,It's a pretty good device. The clarity is really good and the sound is great as well.
4,Good Choice,"I was leary about another blue tooth head set that would be sub-par at best. I bit the bullet and bought it, and I was surprised of the clarity of the headset. I've had no complaints of people saying they can't hear me, inside or out (make sure it's not TOO windy out, of course you'd hear that). All in all it's a good head set at a decent price. Plantronics makes probably some of the best head sets so it's a smart buy."
3,Good headset but needs frequent replacement from manufacturer,I bought the Plantronics Voyager 510 in June of 2007. I'm now on my third one and this one has just exhibited the problem all of the previous headsets subcumbed to...at some point they no longer hold a charge or can't be charged. Plantronics has been great about replacing each failed headset but it can get expensive when you start adding up the cost to ship each failed headset back to Plantronics. I'm now looking for a different headset...three strikes and you are out.
2,Good Audio - Poor Peering Reliability,"I've had this headset for over two years now. The audio quality is quite good, but it's ability to reliably peer with my Treo 700w is poor. I don't believe this is a problem with the Treo as I've had a cheap Cardo headset that peers every time (but with poor audio). I often make calls while driving, have Bluetooth on, and end up having to put my phone up to my ear while the Plantronics is in the other ear. I have to imagine that there are more reliable headsets that provide good audio quality on the market. I just haven't found one yet."
3,Decided on the Plantronics but.......,So after a lot of research I decided on the Plantronics Bluetooth headset verses all the other products for the Blackberry 7250. I think that this product works well except I find myself going back to the blackberry itself when there is noise in the background. I think that it does a good job in a perfectly quiet environment but once I am in a public place it seems that no one can hear me over the noise. I do not know if others that are more expensive are better at noise cancelation but this one could use some work. That being said I think Bluetooth wireless technology is great and I am sure it will get better over time.
1,Noise cancellation actually amplified background noise. Returned for refund.,"When my husband tried to talk to me from within Wal Mart, the background noises (cart rolling, humming motor and fan from refrigerated flower case, and overhead PA system announcements) were actually amplified and hurt my ears. This made a conversation too unpleasant to continue.After opening and trying one ear piece, when he attempted to try the fit of another one, the first one wouldn't come out! He said that in spite of space afforded by the large design, the buttons were quite tiny. The power button was hard to press, and the volume rocker was hard to ""find"" and not easily pressed.For him it did not live up to the very positive review from so many (PC mag, Cnet, etc.)Will try the BlueAnt Z9i."
1,Worked great for a month,The first month that I had this product I could not have been happier. People said that I sounded like I was on a land line. Now they say that I sound like I am in a tunnel and they can barely understand me. I am now past the 30-day window to return the product and will be throwing it away.
1,Don't buy this,"If you never use your bluetooth outside you might take a chance with this item. If you do use a bluetooth outside then do NOT buy this one. No one can hear one word I say when I'm outside. It's not wind becase it will do this on a perfectly calm day, consistantly."
2,Bad transmission quality,"After using this device for two days, I found that the person from the other line cannot hear me talking, although I hear them fine. In addition, the indicator light on the headset stopped working, even when I turned it on and off and recharged it. Therefore, I concluded that the transmission on this device is terrible. Also, it doesn't fit well on my ear because of its big pack."
5,My wife loves it!,"Bought this headset for my wife. She loves it and has found it very easy to use. That from someone who is, to say the least, ""technologically challenged"" is a great compliment."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought planronics Bluetooth headset more than a year ago, it was really great. When I lost it I dcided to buy another planronics, so I searched the net for the best Bluetooth headset review and this one came up in the top, despite the unattractive look and the fact you cannot wear it on both sides, I decided to buy it for its performance.Unfortunately it was one huge disappointment, with short wireless range, bad voice in wind, even the answer button did not work!So, don't waste ur time and money on this piece of junk."
2,Plantronics gone wrong,"I am sorry to say, I don't like them. Even the one I bought for may friend and sent back twice for different problems, won't even wear her's. She says the same as me, it doesn't hold charges long enough and even when they are fully charged the reception is not clear enough for us. She bought a different one at AT&T and I think I will go back to my old one. Just for an example we were in Target the other day, Xmas shopping, she tried to call me and visa/versa she finally turned her's off and so did I.....They were on sale for about half off and I thought it was such a bargain I bought one for me and one for her...So I guess I got what I paid for, Huh?"
1,"Bad items, or bad product?","I ordered this unit based on many positive reviews. However, the first unit sent to me by Amazon was defective out of the box. I returned it, and a replacement was sent, which was also defective. I sent it back again, this time requesting a refund.I ended up purchasing a Motorola H700, which I am very pleased with.I am left with the question of whether or not the bad luck I had with the Plantronics headsets represented a bad batch, or a bad product."
1,beware poor quality,"I bought one of these i have owned 4 plantronic 510 before this one they were great this one is junk, lots of back ground noise i have tried to use it mutiple times every one says that the static is louder than my voice and it picks up every little back ground noise wind you might as well forget it DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY not a good deal at all"
3,It's OK,"I have never owned an headset that worked great and this one is no different. The sound quality is not the greatest and the volume could be higher. I have owned headsets that cost over $100 and they were not great to say the least. The positive for this headset is the price, For around $40 you can get a headset that is just ok for me. I hope that your experience is better than mine."
2,Big shortcoming- Volume,"Comfortable, easy to pair, affordable. BUT, the volume is inadequate for driving. I have a quiet riding Lexus and had difficulty hearing at highway speed. I can't imagine using it in a noisier environment at all. I guess if you're the kind of person who can talk on a cell phone over loud night club music, this is a nice unit."
5,Nice one for the price,"This is definitely a good one for the price I have paid and there is a DEFINITE Noise Reduction in this since I can now speak from my Cafeteria, Bus stop and Metra station and people on the other end are experiencing a great difference.It has got a long talk time and standby time and hence will recommend this for strongly."
5,Plantronice Voyager 510,"I read all the reviews of this item before I bought it. I have not had the problems finding the power switch as others have. I bought this to replace a Motorola headset that just wasn't loud enough to be heard over my truck's engine.The Plantronics is plenty loud, with crystal clear sound. It is comfortable, and easy to use. All in all, I couldn't be happier."
5,Very satisfactory,"The sound quality is exceptional. I have been on conference calls with my clients and not once was I asked if I was using a headset. They didnt know the difference. This headset is also very confortable to wear the whole day and works great while driving.Complaint 1: if the headset is not on your ear, then it gets very difficult to put it on while driving with one hand. So I always have to ritually wear it before I start driving.Complaint 2: Volume control buttons are difficult to operate while wearing. So I always use the volume controls on my phone.Overall, very satisfactory and worth every penny."
2,Ordinary BT headset!,"Pros:1. Quite comfortable on the earCons:1. wind noise (reception on the other side is not that good, if you are walking/travelling)2. size on the higher side (could have been smaller/slimmer)After using it for some time, went to normal wired headsets for my iphone."
3,No Microphone Volume and It Needs It Badly,"Based on the positive reviews here and elsewhere, especially compared to the Jawbone, I went for this headset as my first foray into Bluetooth.I'll be returning it for one simple reason: The microphone volume is too low and you can't adjust it. Most of my calls are conference calls. If people can't hear me, which they can't with this headset nearly as well as with my wired headset or the phone handset, then it's useless.The sound quality of the speaker itself is great, but that offers little consolation.I spoke to Plantronics support and they recommended the Discovery 925, their new model with ""Audio IQ"", which increases your voice volume, but they said that it doesn't do as well with wind. The guy did admit that my voice volume was lower with that headset as compared to the phone handset.Not sure what's so hard about getting this right...."
3,Just O.K.,"I purchased this bluetooth systems for my Iphone, which it does pair with, with no problems. This is my first bluetooth, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I find the thing somewhat cumbersome. It is difficult to fit onto my ear (it falls off), especially when I'm wearing glasses, which is most of the time. I've also had some issues with the sound getting crackly for some unknown reason. As far as elimination of background noise goes, it is better than the wired headset provided with the Iphone, but not by that much. I'm not sure why this product has gotten such rave reviews on Amazon."
2,"eh, i think there's better out there somewhere.....","I got this product with the understanding that it was one of the best out there. But to my disappointment more than 80% of the time I have talked to someone with it they have questioned me about my connection. It's unfortunate to think I was so anxious to get to try this bluetooth out. However, I am stuck with it for now and will make due with it. People have mentioned that it sounds like I am underwater or there's other noise...maybe I got a bad one.Better luck to the next person."
2,Too much buzzing,Wanted to like it after reading all of the very good reviews but callers all told me that they heard a buzz (sometimes slight and sometimes not so slight). The buzzing occurred when using my Nortel IP Phone 1140E and my LG VX8300. Tried only pairing to one at a time and that didn't help. The 510 is going back.
2,Too Big,This is for people with big ears. The back piece is very large and presses the ear outward. Wearing it for longer than a few minutes causes ear tenderness. I am forever taking it off without thinking as it is bothering me. The piece that extends into the ear is also bothersome. I would not recommended to another woman. I gave it two stars as the sound quality is very good.
5,Solid bluetooth headset,"I've had 3 headsets already, and each one had something about it that I didn't like. I hesitated to buy this one, despite the great reviews, because I wanted one that didn't give me the 'telemarketer' look. Top things I was looking for were: sound quality, comfort, and battery life. This unit delivers on all 3 counts. It sounds fantastic, it's really comfortable (especially with the Jabra EarGels on the ear piece), and the battery lasts a long time. Looking back, this is the one that I should have bought in the first place. Recommended."
3,had to return it,"Unfortunately I received a defective unit - it wouldn't light up when I plugged it in to charge. After calling Plantronics I returned it to Amazon for a refund. I decided to get the 520 model instead, because it seems less bulky behind the ear. I have small ears and the 510 did not fit very securely."
2,poor voice clarity,"If this is the best bluetooth has to offer, then the technology has a long way to go. I have been forced to stop using the device since no one can understand a word I am saying. I am forced to look for a different headset, hopefully one that actually does what it is designed for."
5,MotoWHO,"First let me say the only gripe I have with this headset is the power button. Its too small and hard to press. Now on to the good stuff. I purchased this to replace my MotoWHO headset. Let me tell you, this thing will amaze you. The clarity, the abliy to hear the other person without having to press the bluetooth in my ear, the comfort. Yes its bigger than the MotoWHo headset, but you will enjoy the fact that you can actually lie down on the sofa,bed,floor, on your back, and not have to feel the stupid headset lifting of your ear because its over your ear(motowho). Battery life is longer also. If you are looking for a good headset, I take that back, a great headset, this will do."
2,Junk,I use this with a Razr and I have to say it has been only slightly better than holding the phone.Issues include:frequent loss of signal.sound is too muddy to use voice dialing reliablyeven with windshield outdoor use is horrible for the other end of the callunable to recover after a call is dropped. Must power off and on the earpiece to restore the ability to make a call.Would recommend against.
2,50/50 chance it's a lemon,"I have bought 3 of these now and have been pleased with everything except the longevity. They die almost to the day after 1 year, sometimes sooner. First people can't hear you, the battery becomes unreliable then it's all over soon after that. I will say this: while it works, it works very well. It's comfortable to the point I forget I have it on and small enough my hair hides it most of the time.UPDATED: When it's good, it's very god and when it's bad, it's horrid. I ordered a replacement when mine died after a year (as usual) and the new one wouldn't pair. The replacement to that one doesn't hold a charge. I plan to look into other types/brands."
4,Great headset,"I needed an upgrade from the bluetooth headset I had, and this one was just the ticket! Much easier to hear with this baby in my ear, and works with the radio on, driving my car, in crowds, etc. Highly recommend this model if you have trouble hearing phone calls on your bluetooth."
3,plantronics review,"Overall the voyager 510 is a good product. clear transmission, no complaints from my clients who are at the other end. The 510 stays charge for quite some time.The downside is the earpiece which is enourmous and it's difficult to put on if you are wearing your sunglasses."
5,Plantronics Voyager 510 Review,"I have 6 headsets and all are OK. I just received the Plantronics unit, just out, and it is simply the best sounding, most comfortable and best value available. I have a Jobra, 2 Logitechs, Body Glove and 2 older Plantronics units. The 510 is THE ONE. I wear it all day and I forget it's on my head until it rings. It works in the wind and in my office. It's a 10!"
3,fits a little big for ladies,its a little big for me.the on/off switch is difficult.make sure it is OFF or you will use up your battery
4,Plantronics 510 Bluetooth,"sound quality is very good. The only problem I have with it is the on and off button is a bit tricky and seems to be problematic. Generally that is only an issue it manages to get turned off during the day, but in the am it connects easily to my phone."
4,Comfortable...,"This unit is very comfortable. Sound quality on both ends is good. Standby and talk time are good. Only complaint is connect time is slow. Averaging 2.5-3 seconds after you press the button to answer. (Undoubtedly, because of being only BT v1.2.)"
4,Great headset!,"It's a great headset. I have this one and a Jawbone. While this one doesn't have the same noise cancellation abilities as the Jawbone, it goes louder for those people who don't talk into the phone. I actually recommend this one over the Jawbone on overall value even though I use this one mainly as my backup."
4,"Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life","Very pleased with my choice. The reviews helped me to pick this model. They seemed to speak more consistently about the comfort of this model compared to others. I find it to be quite easy to wear.It might seem a little large, but perhaps that pays off with the overall comfort, good range, and good battery life. I do not find it to be heavy. I also get few complaints about ambient noise, difficulty hearing me, etc.I resisted buying one for years, partly because I hated those dorks who walk around the airport and talk to themselves with the right side of their head lit up like a Christmas Tree. I am now one of those dorks and I love the convenience and increased productivity."
4,Great sound and ease of use,"I have bought 3 of these items for family members and they love them. A headset, like this one, that has an earpiece that goes in the ear gets so much better sound."
4,Nice device with more pros then cons,"this is like 3rd bluetooth i bought and by far, it is the best one.pros:Good audio quality of mic and earphoneNicely made so you wont feel it in your earseasy to set uplong battery lifeCons:Buttons not positions properly, but you can get used to itIt is big in size so if you want something like jewelery then buy something elseBut overall excellent quality in very affordable price"
1,horrible device,I bought this headset for my treo 650 and when I tried using it the static on it was loud I could barely hear anyone on the other line. It says it has a range of 30 feet but in my experience if it was more than 3 feet away you would not be able to hear anything. I called Plantronics and they told me it must be a defective device and to return it. I did so got another same headset and I encountered the same exact problems. I would not reccomend this device to anyone.
4,"good product, excellent battery life","So far I've found the battery life to be excellent. It's pretty comfortable to wear because it comes with different size ear pads. Most people I talk to can't tell I'm on a headset - even outside. Range is good for about 20 feet - beyond that, the sound gets choppy. The on/off/mute switch is tricky - you can't feel any click - you have to watch the LED. Volume is fine, sound is clear. Just make sure push the ear pad a little into your ear canal."
3,Too small for seniors,"My mother and aunt are both >60, and they have had trouble turning the BT headset on and off. Not only is the on/off small, the action is not intuitive (do you push toward the bend in the earpiece, in the opposite direction, or 'downwards'?). I have this same BT headset. While I think it works very well and have been very pleased, this is a heads up if you are thinking about getting something for older users."
2,disappointed,"i bought this one because of the excellent review, however, after pairing it to my Treo 650 and using it for a couple of days, i'm quite disappointed. The sound quality is ok, sound level is on the low side and some noises from time to time. i had a Samsung WEP200 too and had better quality than this one, and Samsung WEP200 is about half of the price of this. then there is the usability issue too, sometimes i hear the phone ringing, and pushed the button to accept the call and it wouldn't connect right away, had to wait several seconds to establish the link, the Samsung WEP200 and another Motorola ear piece i had did not have this problem."
4,Plantronics Voyager 510,"The shipping took longer than expected. The promised noise reduction is great. It doesn't have the echo of the Motorola Bluetooth I had. The wind still makes it hard for the other party to hear. Its better than normal microphones, but still isn't up to what the website (amazon or plantronics) promised.The battery discharged a lot quicker than it should have. The instructions say a 3 hour charge is complete. I decided to follow my own instincts after it discharged after 15 minutes and charged it over night. I then used it until the battery died in the middle of a call and then charged it over night again. After 3 or 4 conditioning charges, it now stays charged longer. Today I talked for nearly 3 hours.Over all, I'm very happy with it."
2,Does not work with Treo 700,"I would have loved to use this headset, but it was not compatible with my Treo 700. It initially paired with the device and then never re-connected. I am sure I should have researched this more before I ordered, but I asumed most bloothtooth devices worked across the board and just figured I'd lose advanced features if compatibility wasn't perfect. Plantronics support confirmed that it's not compatible with my Treo 700. I hope new Treo users see this message before they do the same! I had to return it to Amazon."
3,Decent headset,"This headset is okay. Audio is clear, battery life isn't all that great. When I push the button on the headset to take an incoming call, there is delay of about 2 seconds before I hear the person calling me. I got this headset to replace a lost headset. The one I lost would last for 3 or 44 days on one charge, not this one, maybe 2 days??? Maybe. It's big and heavy on the ear. Takes a few uses to get use to."
1,Plantronics Voyager 510,"I returned this product, it did not work as well as I thought it wood. People I was talking to said there was too much background noise,said it sounded like I was in a cave. This is the first time I ever returned anything to you. Thank You Dean Showers"
4,First effective Bluetooth device I've used,"I haven't had much luck with the Motorola Bluetooth headsets - poor voice recognition, annoyingly bad fit, etc. The Voyager is comfortable and effective. I'd buy again if needed."
5,One Great Bluetooth,"If you want to have inexpensive and really good bluetooth then this is it. I bought 2 of these. It works great! there is no noise in the headset, the other party can hear you loud and clear. I strongly recomand this product. You will not be disappointed."
4,"Great Battery Life, Good Sound Quality","I purchased this Bluetooth headset after my Motorola Bluetooth died after one year. It takes a little getting used to fitting this headset to your ear, but once on it is very comfortable. I read one comment that it is difficult to wear if you are wearing glasses but I have not found that to be the case. The clarity of sound is good, and the controls while a little fiddly work well. The battery life is amazing, I am still running on the first charge and I use my headset every day. If you are looking for a good Bluetooth headset at a very reasonable price I would recommend this one."
3,Did not work well with Treo,"My Treo 700wx had difficulties pairing with and recognizing this headset. Sometimes it would work fine and other times, I would have to soft reset my phone to use this headset. It was frustrating. For the Treo, I recommend the Samsung WEP200. It works great and is very nice and small."
4,overall good buy,"I love this product, it fits so easily in the ear and is barely noticable, would reccomend this to anyone. Very easy to use."
3,Plantronics Headset,The unit works okay. Sometimes the connection drops and reconnects. The earpiece can be very uncomfortable if worn for an extended period of time. I haven't attempted to change out the earpiece to another size.
4,Nice one,"Nice one, and like it very much. It is light weight also so feel easy while bearing it. Long battery life, good sound quality but not excellent. Fit easily in your ear as well.Noice concealing does not work as it claims, as caller can feel poor voice quality and noice when I am talking while driving.I use it with Palm Treo 650, got in sync very easily. There after never required it re-syncing. There is a problem with Treo combination, like hands free picks up signal only after 3 rings with palm Treo also single of the mobile gets weaker when using it.Still doing a good job, recommended."
4,Plantronics 510,This product is good but not as much as Plantronics 340. I feel the comfort is better with Plantronics 340. With the 510 model the volume control and the power switch are hard to reach when in use. Less compact. But performance is good. I have had this bluetooth disconnect on it's own while in use a couple of times. 340 is much sleek looking than 510.
2,"Well, it works","There are much better bluetooth headsets out there, though this one is pretty cheap - in price and quality. The most annoying thing for me was that bright blue led light. This headset is big and bulky, didn't fit my ear well, and was uncomfortable."
1,Not good for more than one year!,I found this one after trying jabra and motorola. I found it very good in terms of quality and battery life. But things do not look the same way after a year. I don't think this product lasts more than a year!! Other parties are always complaining that they couldn't hear me.I have to shout if I am on this headset.This wasn't the case initially. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody.
2,Plantronics 510 Voyager,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged]The headset is comfortable and easy to wear. The volume controls on the headset also works well and can be used.The mute button is very small and difficult to access during a call making it almost impossible to use. The mic has low volume and there is no way of increasing the mic volume which makes it difficult for people listening to hear you.
5,Product works!,This is my third Bluetooth ear piece and this one is the only one that really works. I can adjust the volume and actually hear it. The two Memorex versions I had were junk and cheap. I recommend this one if you are a person that buys an item for its quality not its price.
2,Don't bother,"Bought this for my wife to replace the Jabra that came with her phone, it slid on her ear to much and could not be adjusted to fit. Also it would offen get the names totally wrong when she spoke them. She switched to my Jabra and I tried it, It would not recognize any thing I said while in a car. I just got a LG unit for Christmas I'll see how this works.Brian"
2,do not fit on ear properly,"This bluetooth doesn't fit properly on the ear. I tried it for a day and I was feeling all the time it is going to fell off. I returned it next day. To be frank, I didn't really test any of its feature much."
3,on off button is hard to press,All other reviews pretty much tell how good this unit is. My only complain is that the on/off switch is so small and is very hard to press. You need a sharp thumb nail to actually press that button.
4,Plantronics Bluetooth,"I purchased this product for my wife. She is very happy with it, so I am very happy with it, cause--when momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy!"
3,Good while it lasted,"I had one of these for about a year after my Jabra headset died. On the whole it did the job well, pairing was quick and easy and voice performance was good. With my phone a double tap on the mic button would redial the last number but I only got voice dialing to work once. The earhook design sits better on my head so I could use it for several hours although sunglasses can be inconvenient.I would have given it 4 stars but mine lost its power switch recently so I need a new bluetooth headset, I might even buy another one of these."
4,good product,"I bought this to replace a Motorola H850 Bluetooth that quit working. This has much more volume so I can actually use it while driving in my car. It is larger and more bulky than the Motorolas. But for me, I like it for the volume."
2,Good audio quality but...,The Audio Quality is quite good. It also works well with two phones. Unfortunately the power plug contact on the earpiece doesn't work well (comes off) and I will have to return the product.
2,WHAT DID YOU SAY AGAIN??,"This headset works rather well if you are sitting still, with no other noise around you. I have to speak in a rather loud voice so the person im speaking with can even hear me. The battery does last a good while on a charge, but overall, this headset should be given away, not sold. I spend most of my time driving, and again, it is terrible if you have road noise or the radio is playing. My friend has one also and the background noise resembles fingernails screeching down a chalkboard. So needless to say, the claim plantronics makes about ""noise cancelling"" is highly overated or they did their testing in a library somewhere...BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!"
5,varry good,I got this for my playstation 3 and i haven found one yet that is as clear as this one. varry nice! id buy another one if i had too :)
2,Revised review - think twice,"Other Bluetooth headsets had a bad echo and delay so I was really wary - not this one. Other reviews mentioned issues with pairing, the on/off, etc. I haven't had that problem so far. I hve tiny ears and wish I could make it fit better, but that is the only criticism.** Review update. I lost the first so I bought another. After the return window the piece where the charger fits popped out and I can't charge the thing. I would thing a high-end Bluetooth should last more than a few months.Again, it was a fantastic product until then."
2,Static issues.,"Got these for my college age kids. My aon said he could hear okay, but people he called said THEY heard a lot of static. He quit using it. He said it wasn't worth it having to repeat everything over and over."
2,plantronics Voyager 510,Only had this bluetooth for 2 weeks and the mouth piece cracked.Only a matter of time before it breaks off completely.
5,AWESOME!,"Great bluetooth ear phone, the speaker volume is loud and clear unlike other blue tooth ear phones I have tried in the past which tends to be alittle too soft on the voice. Ergonomically designed, easy to use. Recommended for everyone."
4,Good quality product,"Talk time more than 7 hrs, very clear, easy call pick button, on off button, easy pairing"
4,Works great (but it cannot handle outside),"I really love this product, works as described, comfortable, easy to use. The noise reduction is awesome, people cannot tell if you're in your car, even a running faucet remains unheard. Only thing to note (and it's kind of a biggie if you need this): you almost cannot use it outside, even walking outside or standing in the slightest breeze creates terrible wind noise on the other end of the line. Shielding it with your hand from the wind provides some relief but on a conference call, people will still ask you to mute yourself."
4,Blue Tooth Headset,"Works great. Has a little more background noise than my last one, but other than that it's great. Easy to use. Easy to put on in a hurry when the phone is ringing!"
3,Great - as long as it lasted,"I was satisfied, but not thrilled with the performance of the Plantronics Voyager until I finally found the best earpiece. Unfortunately I'd spent a long time enduring the others before I experienced the pleasure of the smallest one that fit in my ear and prevented the headset from moving and sound from fading. My primary complaint about this bluetooth device is that without warning, after less than a year, the unit quit charging. The lifespan was way too short."
5,Works great with sidekick 3.,I researched which bluetooth worked well with a sidekick 3 cell phone and the results showed it would be the Plantronics 510. I use it all the time and the sound is great.
5,Tried 4 others...and now I'm happy.,"Took 3 seconds to get used to this headset, and if I ever break or lose it I'm buying another one. Comfy, good battery, great sound, no complaints from others that I can't be heard, wind noise is well controlled, and it disconnects from my RAZR less often than even the Motorola headsets I tried did.Complaints? One. That goldurn LED. Others have mentioned it - I have to as well. What the frickety-fracking heck were Plantronics thinking? You could use this thing to wave a 747 into the gate at an airport, it's so freaking bright. Astronauts can probably see my headset flashing from the shuttle. It can blind you from forty paces. Wait. I take back the blinding part. I can't verify that one. Still, too bright. I dab of black nail polish toned it down, though, enough that people don't duck when around me, fearing a closeby bolt of lightning...Aside from that - HIGHLY recommended."
5,Excellent Service,I was very pleased with the prompt service. My headset arrived with all that was displayed.
4,Works really good,I've had this headset for about almost a year and it works flawlessly. It is quite comfortable to wear with right size ear bud. Only complaint I have is it's bit too large.
4,outstanding quality for the price,This is my second plantronics voyager 510....I bought another for my wife. The clarity plus the way it takes background noise and wind away...is top notch!!
5,"Great, passed the Sister and Mom test","My Mom can't hear anything and my Sister complains everytime I use a bluetooth headset. When I use my Plantronics Voyager 510 not only can my Mom and Sister hear me crystal clear I can hear them Crystal clear. I looked it up in CU before I bought it. I am glade that I picked it up, it is great."
4,worth buying,"This is the only bluetooth product I have used, but when I lost my first Voyager 510, I purchased the exact same one. The sound quality is excellent, most people can't tell I am using it. It is easy to pair to a phone (mine is a sprint), and simple to use in general. Though it comes with earpieces that are of various sizes, my only complaint is that it feels like it may fall off my ear sometimes. The price is reasonable and I definitely recommend this product."
2,Works but Yuck!,"This headset generally works, though there was times I needed to re-pair it. My problems with it that are:1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough, but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2) It's big! It's comfy enough on your ear, but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it, its hard to get out of your pocket.3) Flashing blue light is way too bright! When is dark and I'm in the car, I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly. It disturbed my passengers too.4) Wind tolerance - it's better than my H700, but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind.I'm sending mine back and getting another H700."
3,Voice pick-up is not strong enough,"I have used this headset for about a year and I constantly hear complaints that the person or group I am talking to on the other end cannot hear me well. I have to talk LOUD to be heard. I have tried this headset VOIP and with my cell phone and it is a little better with my cell phone but still not what I would consider adequate. I do not have a good speaking voice so it partially could be my voice. Still, I would think a headset would allow for adjustments to compensate for those of us whose voice may not pick up as well so far from the microphone.I can hear the other party very well and the volume controls work well. Also, battery life is good, and it is a comfortable headset so I really do not have any other complaints."
2,Bulky and Noisy,This product was received packaged well and on time. I wouldn't not recommend it however because of the physical size and quality of the audio. You will get a lot of ambient noise when used in a car or and area where background noise is high. The battery life is not as advertised if you talk on it a lot.
3,Works but beware,"Of the blue tooth I have bought or tried, the voyager 510 is probably one of the best, it's light, fits great, you even forget it's on your hear. the sound quality is excellent... as long as you communicate with somebody using a blue tooth, unfortunately, if you call a land line, they often seem to have a hard time hearing you. I thought it was just mine, but I am having the same issue when my wife calles the land line and I have read multiple comments along the same line."
5,Great Bluetooth Headset,"This headset is by far the best I have purchased so far! It does not make you sound like you are in a tunnel, and is very clear sounding to others when you call them. Plus the price on Amazon is the best price I have found. I highly recommend it!"
4,a solid ear bud,"this is my third ear bud and is by far the best. the sound quality is better than the other two i tried. although the fit is a little quirky, sometimes i forget i'm wearing it. decent range, good sound quality, works well... i'd buy it again."
4,STOP SHOUTING IN MY EAR!,"First off, THIS UNIT IS LOUD!The big bonus with this headset is the VOLUME. I am very hard of hearing and even I turn the headset volume down.I had three other headsets and this one is the most comfortable one of them all.The clarity of the callers voices is excellant. I would of given five stars but my voice is not as clear as I would like it to be. I would add though, that I have a very large head, so the distance from the mic to my mouth is probably the issue.I use this for both my cell phone and my PS3 (Thank you multipoint technology!) Great value."
2,not as expected,"Hi,I have used this product for couple of months. Initially it was working great but after couple of months its battery started failing and now it has no recharging capability so I have to buy a new bluetooth headset. Offcourse I wont buy this headset again I would prefer Nokia ones."
1,Inaudible Tunnel,"I tried this headset with the Blackberry 8830, and had to return it after a couple of weeks of use. People complained that I sounded like I was in a tunnel or cave. Additionally, there was an annoying amount of static when using the headset. On the plus side, the headset easily paired with the phone and kept the pairing without fail."
1,Incompatible charger,"This device uses a proprietary connector for the charger.Motorola RAZR, many headsets from Motorola, and many other mobile devices use the mini-USB connector for charging. With a common connector, a single charger can charge all your devices. Ditto a single charger in your car will suffice. And with a mini-USB cable you can charge from your computer. When I travel I bring my laptop, the cell phone, a headset, and a mini-USB cable.Not the case here. When you travel with the Plantronics device you have to remember to bring an extra charger with you. And if the headset needs to be charged while in your car, you're out of luck.Instead, go with a headset that can use the same charger as your phone."
4,Way better than my last Bluetooth!,The best thing about this headset is that it stays on while you're physically active. I couldn't shake this thing off if I wanted to. It's also nice and loud and has epic battery life.
3,Just okay...,"The sound quality is okay, sometimes people can't really hear me though.One time I accidentally dropped it in the water, after I let it dry, it's working again. Now I give it to my boyfriend, he uses to play Red dead redemption online on PS3 with his friends."
1,headset,"When I could not get the 910 to work, I bought this one. I never got this one to work either on my computers or cell phone. Thought it was because the price was right when I bought it, I wasted my money on it too. I seem to be a slow learner."
2,Uncomfortable,Too big and bulky...I was kind of glad my pup got a hold of it so I could have an excuse to get a new one. Very difficult to put on especially wearing glasses......did not really fit around my ear.
4,"Good Sound, Voice, and Comfort. Small Buttons.","This is the second Bluetooth that I have used and I have purchased 2 units over the last couple of years. I am very happy with the listening and voice quality and the 510 is very well built. Wearing for a couple of hours in the car is not a problem. However, I do not like the size of the volume and power buttons and had to order a car charger separately, which was tough to find."
3,Sounds like I'm in a box to recipient and lose signal away from phone.,"I really like having the hands-free benefit of using a bluetooth headset. This set is comfortable and lightweight. I can hear extremely well but the person I'm speaking to says I sound like I'm in a box. Also found that walking away from the phone, even 15 feet, would cause static and loss of signal. I like the fit of the phone and it is easy to use and set up. Easy to answer the phone and to adjust volume. I read all the reviews before purchasing this set and they were favorable. Maybe I missed the one about the sound and the loss of signal. This is the reason I am taking the time to write a review. They are extremely useful if honest. Since I had not used a bluetooth wireless headset before, I found myself trying to answer the phone when it rang and when the headset was on. Kept saying ""hello"" ""hello"" until I realized I had to use the headset. DUH!!!!"
4,better then most...,"This headset fits well, has good sound quality, and has good enough battery life. But as many others have said, the on off switch is terrible. It's very hard to push and manipulate. I bought a second one for my wife, but she hates hers..."
4,VERY GOOD PRODUCT WELL WORTH THE PRICE,"Works very well and has a descent range. I've sent back two headsets before this one but this one's a keeper. Considering the price sound quality on both ends is exceptionally well. The only few set backs is it can be sensitive to wind if you're outdoors, it can become uncomfortable in the back of your ear but not enough to effect the quality (you can easily just switch ears every few minutes) and the battery life could be longer. These small things are all that keep it from 5 stars. But even still a very good buy that I don't regret."
5,Best item I bought in a long time,"At first it takes a bit of getting used to to put it on your ear.Once you got that mastered, it's just very handy.No more need to keep your phone in 1 hand and do crazy stunts with your car with the other one.No problems driving with the window open either"
5,Great with PS3,i went out on a limb with this one since there were no PS3 reviews for it that I could find and I must say I had absolutley no problems connected great EZ to use sound quality is perfectAnd battery life is longer than what the box Projects Ive used the headset for 4+ hours and the box only gives it a 3 hour life
4,Worth the money! Sound Clarity is Very Good!,"Comfotable to wear, sorta bulky though. Sound is great, no complaints from anyone. Easy to switch from left to right ear. Good product for the money."
2,Too slick by half,"The device works well, when it does work. I like its feel, and sound quality, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to become an expert operator. Me, I just want the stupid thing to work. As there is really only one button to operate its features it relys on the number of pushes, etc. This is a problem if you lose track of what your doing, which is easy to do when your multi-tasking (aren't we all). The device will suddenly switch sounds back to the phone for no reason at all. I suspect my problems are due to operator error, but I don't want another device I have to study to operate. Its a good device, but certainly not 'plug and play'."
4,Great for Driving,"This is a great item for someone who is on the road alot. The sounds quality is good, sometimes a little too good, and it is fairly easy to use. the only drawback are that the volume control and on/off buttons are a little small and too close together. Altogether a great item and much better than others I've tried."
4,A trucker best friend !!!,"Hey, what can I say, I have tried other brands of blue tooths, but this one is the only one I found to hold up to the diferent noises of a Petes truck and road noise. I can clearly hear whoever is calling me without having to ask them to repeat what they said. The battery is good enough for me about 4 to 6 hrs. of talking time. It is a good head set to use, is confortable. Mine came with diferent size ear pieces. It works so good I got one for my wife also. It just sounds great!!!"
2,Not good for those of us who wear glasses!,"So, I bought this item because of the rave reviews about it's clarity. I didn't realize how hard it would be to put on. The directions are simple...run the large piece along your ear and fit the ear piece into your ear canal....not that simple. I have small ears to begin with so that large back piece is too heavy. And since I have to wear glasses, there isn't much more space back there. Don't get me wrong, the ear piece has great clarity and I haven't had any problems with the other person hearing me, even when driving. I just can't get the darn ear piece to stay put.I keep having to adjust it when I'm driving, which isn't safe. So, if you wear glasses, even sunglasses, or have small ears....steer clear of this piece!"
3,it doesn't compatable with ipod touch 2nd G. OS 3.0,"it is a good quality of headset, but it is not comparable with ipod touch 2nd G, OS 3.0."
2,Works ok,"It works OK. As long as there is not a lot of outside noise (e.g., driving) it works great. But, it fits a bit loose so I sometimes have to press it up to my ear so I can hear clearly. And, it picks up extraneous noises which sometimes is very annoying to the other person on the phone."
3,great bluetooth..has one downfall,"Great bluetooth..good sound and comfortable to wear...I'm on my 4th one..it has one downfall..after charging it multiple times, the small contact pin in the base breaks off making it unchargeable...but I keep buying them..wish they would fix the charging problem.."
5,Excelent,"This 510 replaces the 510 I lost last month. I used the old one for about 3 years and was very satisfied with the sound quality, noise canceling in the car, battery and convenience. The new one appears to be identical in performance and features. I expect similar length of service.I have used Logitech and Motorola headsets, neither provided the reliable performance of this unit."
4,Plantronics 510 Headset,Headset fits smartly around ear. You hear others fine. I have had complaints that I sound like I am in an echo echo echo chamber when friends listen to me. Still suits my needs well.
5,Great Bluetooth headset! Best value out there.,"I must say I am very happy with this new Voyager 510 headset. Plantronics is the leader in headsets and it is clear to see (and hear) why. It simply works. I can hear the people I am calling and they can hear me - outside, in traffic, on the street, whatever. The sound quality is comparable to a wired headset without the hassle. It pairs easily and the charge lasts a couple days for me. It would be nice if my phone battery lasted as long.I have used many different wired and wireless headset over the years and this is my favorite Bletooth. But ALL my favorites have been Plantronics. Now all I need is a fat endorsement contract! :)"
4,Sa far so good,"So far so good. My wife says it looks bulky on hand but once on your ear not so. Good sound quality, can barely tell you are on a Bluetooth."
3,Its ok,"The Plantronics 510 is ok. Mine seemed to work better on my end than the receiving party's end. I could hear pretty much as well as with my old wired earbud (Jabra 100). But I had a few complaints from others that they could not hear me very well on their end. Its ok for the price, but I cant give you two thumbs up... more like one up and one down."
3,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,"Overall the unit fits well and is easily adjustable for either the left or right side. It's noise canceling feature is very limited, if non existant. While walking down a street with a slight breeze my callers say they have difficulty hearing and understanding me. If my cell phone is in my pocket the unit has problems with the Blue Tooth connection. Problem with the actual unit? Don't know, don't have another one to compare to. It's voice transimission to my phone is very limited and I have difficulty making the phone recognize my verbal call commands. I will keep this unit because I primarily bought it for use in my vehicle. For everyday use I would say look for something a bit better. Seeing how this was not a cheap unit I am a bit disappointed in it's function."
4,Great hands free for PS3,"I use this headset exclusively for gaming on the PS3. It works beautifully. I can go to the fridge, upstairs, or outside and still talk to whoever I am chatting with.I would give it five stars if I had been able to also connect it to my phone. The description says it is capable but my phone was never able to connect to it. I did connect it to the PS3 first, but that really should not make any difference. This does not bother me too much since I do not want to walk around in public with something stuck in my ear. I was not trying to use the PS3 and phone at the same time either (if anyone thought that was the reason).A co-worker has one that he uses with his phone and I never can tell he is using a hands-free.I highly recommend this product unless you are looking for it to connect to two devices."
4,If the headset fits......,"Fits the ear perfectly.Does not interfere with glasses.Ample volume range.Comfortable.Excellent battery life.Good value for the money.Excellent earpiece sound quality.Excellent microphone voice quality (when not in a noisy environment).Cons:If you're in a noisy environment, the microphone sends the noise to the person you're talking to.I was hoping volume would be loud enough to use for my one ear that has 60%+ hearing loss but, that's not the case. I did not include this as a factor in my rating of this productThis headset is not as stealthy as I would have liked but, I don't really care about that. This may be a problem for some."
4,Excellent,"This product is worth the price. Excellent battery life and excellent usefulness. I use it with the phone and with my laptop, to chat on the net. The wind blocking could be a little better though. I love this product. The ear buds keep falling of though."
3,Dont know whats wrong,I have been having problem with this headset. I need to have it replaced soon.
1,unhappy,"I AM UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HAS ALREADY QUIT WORKING. IT WONT ANSWER, IT WONT REBOOT. I AM SATISFIED WITH NTHE WAY THE PRODUCT WORKED UNTIL THIS HAPPENED. I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT FOR A NEW ONE, BUT I CANT FIND MY COPY OF THE RECEIPT. HOW CAN I DO THIS.THANK YOU, LESLIE HAMMONS"
2,AC Charger Won't Stay In and No Car Charger Included,"I don't understand all the great reviews for this unit. I can't keep the charger plugged in properly - the slightest movement on any surface disengages the connection so that when I retrieve it, I can't tell if it's charged or not unless I press it in and set it down just right and wait for a blue light. It's as if the unit and the charger were not properly designed to work together.I also thought all bluetooth units came with a car charger - after all, the point is to be mobile, and you want to be able to charge it when it runs down on the road. I suppose for the price I should not have expected that I'd have to get one separately, but I've never bought one before, and all the ones I saw in stores looked like they included one.I never actually used the unit on a live phone call, so I can't comment on its quality, but having to fiddle with the charger connection constantly to be sure it didn't disengage is reason enough to return it."
2,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,"The voice quality from my headset to the other end listener is poor, with a muffled/underwater sound to it."
4,Plantronic Voyager 510 headset + base unit,"This earpiece has the over ear support to stay in my ear with reasonable comfort (I have a small ear hole). It is tiring to wear after several hours, but is the most comfortible I used yet...after using both wireless and wired earpieces.The power button is very hard to use while on the ear, but turning the unit on/off is something that is only done in the beginning and end.I found the earpiece useful enough to use at a desk phone, so I also purchased the base unit. It works very well (base unit also charges the headset).Sound quality is good. Muting is puzzling as it seems to cut out the audio on the receive (unusual) as well as the send (normal).Overall, a very worthwhile purchase."
3,GOOD - BUT OVERSIZED,"I liked this Bluetooth, but it was a bit too large for my ear. I wasn't able to get a snug fit - it kept falling off - and that of course would default the purpose of it. It seems to be more adequate for a larger person. Unfortunately, I returned it for a smaller style."
2,"phone only, no help for treo audio","Boy, was I disappointed. I bought this unit thinking I could use it to listen to digital books from Audible on my Treo. However the unit only activates when a phone call is incoming or outgoing. Not much use to me since I try not to talk when I'm driving."
2,"Great sound quality, but falls right off my ear!!!!","The sound quality is super dooper. However, this thing falls right off my ear. I wish there were options as far as ear pieces or over the head attachments. I most likely have smaller ears."
5,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,"Great blue-tooth. It was very easy to hook up. People have told me, they cannot tell that I'm using a ear piece. You can hear very well using this model. Actually I turn my phone volume down because it's to loud. Very good product for the price. I highly recommended it."
4,Bulky but good,"Seems to function well, you can hear them and they can hear you. Some functions work with my Moto V325i and some don't.This one is definitely more about function that fashion, it's a little bulky."
5,plantronics bluetooth headset,"Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged]An excellent headset.The listeners at the other end could not tell that a headset was being used.Likewise I could hear my caller the way I would hear if I were using the phone itself.The piece is very light,easy to carry behind the ear,and does not look cumbersome."
2,Average product,"When you have to call Plantronics tech support because there device just simply stopped working after 1 day, you know that you've chosen the wrong headset. However, I did get a response back after a few days and there is a hidden reset code for the device. So after resetting the device, its been working fine since. I'm giving this 2 stars because the device is very buggy and the documentation isn't up to par. The sound has some issues as well. For the price of this device, I honestly recommend that you purchase a different headset."
2,Didn't work well for me,"I have a plantronics wired phone headset system which I'm very happy with, so I decided to purchase this additional product from plantronics.However, I'm very disappointed with this product. Between my blackberry 7100 and this headset, something stopped working and I'm no longer able to use this very expensive headset.Also runs out of power very quickly. And I'm not convinced that people could hear me well when it worked."
4,beats h5 Blue Tooth,"I like this beter than H5, 1)Because you don't accident redial. 2) I like that it tells you when you battery is running low. 3)Easier to put on ear.4)you can raise the volume to hear better. and 5) hear little more clearer."
1,"Snap, crackle, hello?","This did not work well for me at all. Every time I turned my head, I would hear snapping and crackling. Whenever I spoke to someone, they kept asking, ""hello?"" thinking the call had been dropped. Maybe I got a defective one, but this was really bad....This was my 3rd bluetooth set. The other 2 - Scala500 and Motorola HS700 were both good."
4,plantronics 510,"used before, like the way it fits, easy to sync/use, good value for the money, excelent way to purchase-Amazon.com"
1,This thing is a waste of good money.,"It works fine when people call me, but when I call people it doesn't work 50% of the time. I use it for work, and when I have to call a client back because my headset doesn't work, that does not look good. I wish I could send it back because it was $75 of wasted money."
2,Comfortalbe to wear but horrible buttons,"The good:* Comfortable to wear.* Doesn't fall.* Good sound and speaker quality.The bad:* Horrible on/off switch.* Not great volume control.* Bad battery indicators.All in all while it isn't the worst product, there is so much to improve here that I simply can't see why it was such a top seller on Amazon. Shame."
3,Works well but bulky,OK unit but very uncomfortable because of the bulk behind the ear. I strongly prefer the Plantronics 220
4,Looking for Bluetooth,"I have tried many different styles and manufacturers of Bluetooth headsets. My criteria are simple. I would like a product that fits comfortably in my ear, is stable, loud enough, provides good reception between the cell phone, adequate battery life and thoughtfully designed buttons on the headset. Guess what. Such a product does not exist. Perhaps the greatest problem is that Bluetooth technology is a poor design and provides variably poor reception depending upon external conditions. This product is clearly among the best around - for Bluetooth. But if you want a clear sounding headset that you mainly use in your vehicle, get an inexpensive wired product and forgo the so-called status of having an ear ornament."
1,sound quality not as suggested,"I bought this unit after reading many positive reviews, and thus hoped for a positive experience. However, the most honest critiques come from my wife, and she said that I sounded muffled and ""like I was talking in the bottom of a barrel"". Unfortunately, I had to return the product. I've also tried Bluetooth from Motorola and received the same critique from my wife. I'm beginning to think that Bluetooth has a long way to go before it has the same quality as wired headsets. I don't like getting tangled up in wires, but I also want my callers to be able to understand me. The wait continues for a proper bluetooth device. (I own a Blackberry 8800 device, by the way.)"
5,Love it.,"I really love this product. It is easy to use and very comfortable on ear. I forget that I have it on after sometime.The quality of sound is very good, I can clearly hear the person I am talking to. And it seems that they can hear me as well.But what I like the most is the price. Very affordable for the quality. So I am very satisfied with my headset.Thank you!"
5,"Not cute, but very functional!","This is just one in a long line of bluetooth headsets that I have owned. It isn't pretty or fashionable, but it is the most functional, quiet and comfortable that I ever used, not to mention the good price. I am very happy with this item."
4,wireless ear piece,I am very happy with this product. Best wireless ear piece I have owned so far.Sound is excellent and the unit is very comfortable to wear.
4,Short talk,"I bought this product after reading the reviews on Amazon.com. I had a similar product and absolutely loved it. This product is good, however the talking period is very short. I was hoping to get at least 6-hour talking time before a charge was necessary. Not the case. The most I can expect is 4 hours. Overall, product is great but could use more talk time."
3,"Works good, sound quality not great","Charge lasts for much longer than our phone and it was easy to hook up to Bluetooth. The sound that receivers hear, however, is muffled. This may be due to the location of the mic boom which is next to your cheek. Need to find a headset like this that has a small mic boom that extends in front of your mouth...where you speak from!"
4,I give it 4 Stars!,Pros:People can hear you well and you can hear them well.Controls are easy to use for volume.Cons:Inner ear piece not confortable for people with small ears.Still kind of bulky compared to the newer generation bluetooths.
4,Not the best but it's comfy,"This is like my 486486151564884th blue tooth and I am sure it won't be my last. It's very comfy, fits pretty snug. My complaints, however, are I have a hard time hearing people. I have it turned all the way up but I still have a hard time hearing. I am always trying to push it in further. Other then that, people tell me I am nice and clear which is a nice change.It's kinda big but that doesn't bother me. The on/off button is super tiny but I don't turn it on/off while still on my head so I don't hit the wrong button but I do have to use my fingernail tip to turn it on/off. It's worth the price, it gets the job done I just wouldn't buy it from a store and pay full price."
5,Much better than the jawbone,"I first bought a jawbone and it was very uncomfortable. It worked fine however UNTIL if broke in my pocket--just snapped right where the ear loop connects to the earpiece, but in such a way that it could not be fixed.I replaced it with the Plantronics Voyager 510 after reading the reviews here and have been 100% pleased. It is very flexible, so you can keep it in your pocket and it won't break. Comfort is soooo much better. I think the sound quality on the users end is better, but not quite as good, though close, on the other party's end--but I paid the money so too bad for them, right? ;)"
4,HANDS FREE,Excellent sound on both ends. Wind noise is minimal. Could be 5 star except unit is susceptible to sweat.
2,Power,My bluetooth does no stay charged and it is brand new. I wonder if I need a need battery already but will be cheaper to buy a new one.
4,review on bluetooth,"The bluetooth works great, especially like the options on the earpieces. Has great clear tone."
2,Don't care for it!,"I find the Voyager 510 to be far more bulkier and uncomfortable than my previous Motorola Bluetooth. Although the sound quality is great, my previous Motorola ""flip"" Bluetooth was much easier to flip open and quickly place on my ear before the call went to voice mail. The Voyager is much more difficult to turn on and off quickly. I plan to ""retire"" this unit and purchase another flip version soon."
4,Very satisfied,I totally agree with the 4 to 5 star ratings. I hear everyone clearly and they can finally hear me. You just can't beat it for the price.
2,Just doesn't stay in my ear,"Even with 3 or 4 different ear plus offered, it just doesn't stay in my ear, constantly falls out."
5,Excellent in (almost) every way,"I generally use my 510 in the car with the windows open.I hear others as if they are right next to me.I'm told I sound the same as if I was on a cell phone but with better wind canceling.The battery life is exceptional.It's very comfortable on either ear as long as you choose the right earpiece for you (included in the package).The only negative to me is that the power button is a bit of a pain to turn off. It's very small, awkwardly placed and requires some oomph to shut down. That is a very small complaint for an otherwise amazing headset."
3,Its okay type,"It does its work nicely. I only had an issue with the behind-the-ear part which is very bulky and quite many times it has hurt me on a longer usage. Also, it gives lots of disturbance while using it during charging (Sometimes you don't really want to hold the phone and your headset is kept on charging... It happened to many a times... :P )"
3,Microphone stopped working after 1 year of use,"It was a good headset: worked with both my cell phone and my laptop (skype, VOIP). Just after the warranty expired, the microphone stopped working: I hear people, but they don't hear me (tried with a number of cell phones, so it is definitely the headset)."
4,No Hesitation To Buy This,"I've used a few Motorola pieces in the past and this one is just blows those away. It is a phenomenal piece.I took one star away due to range. I work in my condo, so often, I will walk away from the hand piece to test its limits. I think within 15 feet is the best range; but if you will always be in an airport or moving with your phone, you can't do better than this for the money. When I'm in my car, the wind noise never affects it.I've been using daily for over a month now via my Blackberry, and my calls are crisp and clear. I haven't had one caller complain that s/he couldn't hear me. I recently purchased an Iogear USB adapter, so I can use this piece with Skype as well!"
4,One person's trash is another's treasure,"I bought this headset for myself and found out, VERY QUICKLY, that it was not one I would keep. It wasn't comfortable (with any of the included earbuds) and I really didn't like the shape of the back of it. I felt like a cyborg.My husband was also in the market for a bluetooth so I gave it to him to try. He has still not given it back! He loves the fit and he loves the sound quality. It has worked very well for him. I can honestly say that I cannot tell when he is talking to me with the 510. The sound is perfectly clear.The reasons why this set only got 4 stars:1. I REALLY don't like the look.2. No case.Other than that, my husband is VERY pleased."
2,Wrong Fit for Me,"I performed well, the audio was great, connectivity was easy. But it was too big for my wife's ear so we had to return it."
3,"Great at first, diminishing quality after ~1 year",I used this headset for more than a year only recently did I start noticing audio problems for both incoming and outgoing audio. Until this came up it was very good. You can read more on the web about others having a similar experiencing. There is even some on the Plantronics forum ([...]).
4,Pricey but worth it,"This is a great headset. Never had any problems with it. I have used it with a multitude of phones including the iphone, motorola, nokia etc and it has worked like a charm every time round. It charges very fast and retains the charge for a long time. So battery life is not an issue to worry about. Also this thing is flexible in the sense that it can be worn on either the left or the right ear as desired. Easy to use although the power button could have been a little bit bigger and more convinient to use. Comes at a price for sure but definitely worth it. Highly satisfied and would recommend it to anyone."
4,Really Good Bluetooth Headset,"The listen side is very good and varies with the earbud you choose (from those provided). The talk side works very well unless their is consistent breeziness or wind. When there is wind or breeze the other party often can't understand, so I guess, as good as Plantronic's noise cancelling technology is, perhaps nothing works perfectly. But overall I really like this headset and would recommend it highly."
4,Love the headset,I traded in my Motorola M500 for this headset and I love it. The listening clarity is great and everyone I've spoken to so far has said that they can hear me well. I also love the fact that I can use it on either ears.The negatives are the 'on' button and it could be a bit uncomfortable on smaller ears. Other than that great product!
4,"Very comfortable, works with multiple devices.","I have used this headset with my Nokia 6620 and with my PC, and it works great with both, switching back and forth easily by telling either the PC or the phone to connect with it. Light crackling on occasion when 802.11b is active in the area, but not terribly noticeable. Sound quality is great indoors. The great thing is the comfort; I find that I can wear it all day long, even though it's not the smallest or lightest headset."
1,"I brought new retail package, but Plantronics exchanged a used one for me","As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak. The other person can not hear me at all. So I contacted Plaintronics for repair. Their repair process has no tracking, just sending in your headset to an address. Two weeks later, I received a used one back, not the one I sent in, packaged in an OEM box. Although this one has better microphone than the new one I sent in, it battery is not very reliable to hold charge, also the battery portion is kind of loose.I can not recommend Plantronics product at all."
3,Decent but not outstanding,Take into consideration I have never used a bluetooth headset before.PROS:Decent battery life (1hr usage for a week without a charge)Easy to push volume rocker and multi-function buttonSomewhat noise cancelingPretty comfortable (can wear it for about 5 hrs before it becomes annoying)Good sound qualityEasy pairingCONS:Low volume (sometimes impossible to hear people)Why did they even bother to put a volume rocker?? It is always too quiet.Hard to press power button sometimesNoise canceling could be a lot betterDifficult to install/change earpieces
4,As good as it gets,"I had the motorola headset and returned it. The audio quality was pretty bad, and it didn't seem to stay on my ear. The plantronics, is by no means perfect, but is great for someone with small ears, stays in place, has very good noise canceling technology (still not as good as the phone itself), and is very easy to use. I'm now pretty used to voice dialing, and very comfortable with the headset (I've had it for about a month). Hang on to the over the mouth piece ""sponges"", they really help on windy days. I've been through quite a few headsets, and this one is by far the best!!"
3,"Good unit, but not if you wear glasses","This is my first BT unit which I bought to replace my wired headset. Incoming and outgoing voice quality is very good, nobody seems to know that I am using a BT headset. Loudness on both sides is also very good. Sometimes I hear a little echo of my own voice and a little static, but nothing major.The problem that I have with this unit is that it that the part that loops around your ear is rather large. When I am wearing my glasses, the loop on the headset sits on top of the loop of my glasses, therefore the headset does not sit properly and is not secure. In addition, I find this unit hard to put on with one hand because of the bulky ear loop; I didn't have this problem with my wired headset.To summarize:- Good voice quality- Comfortable (if you don't wear glasses)- Difficult to put on with one hand- Poor fit for people who wear glasses"
4,Head and Shoulders Above the Moto it Replaces,"I lost my Motorola Bluetooth - Thank Goodness, and the 510 replaces it. It's much better is almost all respects:- Pairs up much, much faster then the Moto did - almostinstantaneous.- Persons on the other end report better audio quality.- Controls simple to use, even for my fat fingers.- For the first time, I can use a headset in my noisy old Jeep.- Confortable - much more so then the Moto.- Not dorky looking. I no longer look like I'm talking the thealiens behind the comet.The only downside is the slight delay when the phone asks me for a name or number dial."
4,Fits better than any other bluetooth I've tried,"I have very small ears and have a hard time finding headphones or ear pieces that don't fall off or out. This Plantronics Bluetooth stays on extremely well thanks to the customizable ear buds and flexible over-ear piece. The one downfall (and reason I didn't rate it 5 stars) is that it begins to hurt the back of my ear after about an hour of wear. Because it's so tight, the hard piece tends to put too much weight or pressure on the back cartilage. Overall, very good value for what I paid and perfect for short commutes in the car or brief conference calls."
1,Unreliable,"It doesn't work. Great quality when it does, but half the time it spontaneously disconnects from my new LG phone. I can't even use it."
3,Yes but,"I read a lot of good reviews and the sound is indeed good. I just wish it fit my ear better. the speaker is a bit far from my ear canal and there is no adjustment to the device except different size earbuds. Oh well I couldn't try it out on the internet. Also the on off switch is very small, in fact the smallest switch I have ever seen. Nice looking but not very practical. Would recommend if you have a smaller ear and good eyes for the on off switch."
4,Great Bluetooth Headset,"After careful review of many of the bluetooth headsets out there, I finally chose the Plantronics Voyager. I have it paired with a Treo 700p. No problems so far (about 2 months usage) with reception, volume, or pairing. No complaints from the people I talk to regarding clarity of my voice. I have gotten about 10-15 feet away from my phone without any static. Fairly comfortable to wear for prolonged periods of time even though it's not one of the lightest earpieces. If you are looking for a reasonably priced funtional headset I can certainly recommend this one."
4,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,Very good headset does not bounce around on my ear. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Great headset --- Lousy charging.,"I will admit that this headset is a great one. Easy to operate and very clear on my Treo 700wx. However, the propriety charging system sucks! They use a small, non-standard connector between the headset and the charger. Mine stopped working just 3 weeks after I got it. When checking for repair, I was told that I ""must have abused"" the headset. I guess they consider pluging and un-pluging the charger abuse. Dumped the set and purchased another brand."
3,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,"Average performance, not particularly well performing in windy conditions or with city noise. Pretty much like all others I have tried."
3,Not as good as the glowing reviews suggest,"I was impressed by the large number of great reviews this product received from Amazon readers, but I was not impressed by the product itself. First, this headset was evidently not designed for my ears because I could not get it to fit properly. Both the earpiece (which is soft and flexible) and the microphone kept pulling away from my face. Not the desired result! The unit is also surprisingly big and bulky considering how small some of the other Bluetooth headsets look. I was also disappointed in the sound quality. There are so many Bluetooth headsets on the market that I encourage people to look at other options before purchasing this particular headset. I just returned my Plantronics Voyager and ordered a Samsung."
2,"If it would stay in my ear, I could actually hear!","no matter what size attachement, it doesn't stay in my ear. I can hear pretty well, but everyone hears the background noise around me. It may make for a good office phone headset, but it's not the right choice for a cell phone headset."
5,Best Bluetooth headset ever,I just want to let everyone know this is by far the best headset I have purchased. I have invested in a few and by far this is the best one. I would recommend it to anyone...especially those who have purchased them in the past and it just didnt meet expectations...The clarity is so good I bought a 2nd one for my wife.
5,Voyager 510,Fantastic product. Listeners do not know I am outside on a headset. Well balanced on the ear since the weight is distributed over the front and back. Several co-workers have purchased this model after my recommendation and are equally happy with the product. This is my third one since they seem to stop accepting a charge after 14-18 months but well worth the cost at 1/2 retail price.
4,"Super clear, long battery life","I've had the Voyager 510 for about a year now and it works very well. The audio quality is *very* clear on this unit and it has a long battery life. The on-off button is a little difficult to use because of its size - its about the size of a large pin head, and the behind the ear battery is a little large - otherwise I would have rated five stars."
3,Easy to use & comfy,"Good price, decent performance. Only problem is folks on the other end always complain about very low volume when I speak."
4,Best bluetooth I've ever used,"Had the Motorolas's before. Broke after only a few months useage. Didn't like the way the speaker just floats on top of your ear letting in all the external noise which forces you to turn up the volume louder than you should. This Plantronics unit fits very comfortably in your ear, sealing out external noise and allowing you to understand the conversation at a much lower and safer volume. Very clear speaker and noise canceling microphone are major pluses. Folds flat for easy storage in your pocket. Fits behind your ear a little which I think looks better than a big hunk of plastic floating on the side of your head.Only draw back is yet another freakin proprietary charger to carry. These companies really need to stop this. Use the small usb type connector that so many devices use now. Then we only need one 120v volt charger and one usb cable to charge off any computer and your done. One star deduction for the charger frustration but otherwise an excellent headset."
2,I give up,"All I'm wanting is something that doesn't fall out of my ear, doesn't break in less than 6 months, and has decent audio quality. I've tried ten different Bluetooth earpieces, and all of them have issues. This is the latest. Worked wonderfully last night -- even used it. Charged it over night... and now when I make calls, the other ends hears the WORST static ever.I'm going back to my wired headset. This is just too hard."
1,Regret buying,"It loses it signal to often even though i have it right here on my waste band one foot away from the phone and both batteries are charged to full capacity. I love the fit on my ear, this item needs to be upgraded"
2,not a great design,"This bluetooth headset has great sound. That being said, it doesn't fit me at all. It falls off of my ear, which is not only annoying, but hazardous while driving. I'm sure it might fit larger people - and if it does, the sound truly is clear as a bell. But if you're small like me (5'2"") with small ears, you may want a different headset for the money."
2,conversation lags,"Excellent as a phone blue tooth but it doesn't work well when using on your pc, as conversation lags, when one talks."
3,One Big Problem with Windows Mobile 6,"This is a great headset but for one thing. The voice call feature on my phone quit working when I upgraded from Windows Mobile 5 to 6. I called the phone manufactor, the cell phone company, and the headset company. None know what to do, only it is incompatable with Mobile 6. Mobile 6 does not use voice tags on selected contacts. It changes voice to digital and looks for what you said. It cannot change the voice from this headset to digital. It works great on answering, not calling with voice. It works great with calls that dial out also.So make sure your headset is compatable to Mobile 6 for voice calling. Of course this assumes that your phone can make voice calls.Again, it works with Mobile 5"
4,Pleased overall,"Overall I am pleased. It is a little bulky. Overall sound quality is pretty good. I don't know if its me or the headset or even the phone, but I can't figure out how to turn down the ringer in the headset (volume button appears to have no effect)....LOUD. Works pretty well with both my cell phones at the same time (haven't figured out how to hold one call on one phone, and answer the other in the headset yet though). Battery life is not bad, I can make it through an entire day (quite a bit of talk time) with out trouble. On/Off/Mute button is VERY difficult to manipulate by touch as is volume rocker. I would recommend this headset to anyone who needs to connect to 2 phones at the same time."
4,510 good quality,"pros:good voice quality -- good sound. relatively comfortablecons:tricky to change ear piecesear pieces somewhat deteriorate over time -- the fuzz that covers the ear piece.it sometimes is a bit bulky, but overtime the weight disappears.the connector is some weird proprietary circle plug -- why not usb?!?!"
3,It's ok - not as good of sound quality as suggested,"I bought this headset because of the phenomenal reviews for the sound quality. Well, I've used it with 2 cell phones now. Now maybe ""for a bluetooth headset"" the sound quality is fantastic, but for a phone I found the sound quality decidedly mediocre. It's not terrible, and the volume is good, but the sound is a little bit fuzzy. I just got an LG 8350 - the sound quality on the phone is phenomenal, and it's very clearly better than this headset.It's an alright headset, and the sound quality is ok. But it's just not ""amazing""."
2,Hit and Miss,"First one I had was great, I wore it out. I bought another same model works terrible sounds horrible will buy another of a different brand. Must have got lucky with the first."
3,Doesn't Make It In The Long Haul,"I first bought the 510 2 years ago and LOVED it. Callers on the other end couldn't believe I was on a bluetooth. I even rode with my sun roof open with no interfence. Yet 2 years later, I have the complete opposite experience. Even driving with the windows up, callers seem to hear road noise. I realize that technology moves at a fast pace and maybe some think that 2 years is a long enough lifespan for a bluetooth headset. For me though, I expect long-term quality out of my investments and was disappointed that this didn't make it."
5,"works great, don't need the manual","I admire products whose interface is so clean and elegant the manual is superfluous. This Plantronics Voyager 510 meets that standard easily; even without a display the device is easy to use, easy to set up, and easier than that to pair up with other devices. I've used this with a Nokia 6085, with my Macbook, with a Pantech C150 and with a Blackberry - in all cases it was easy to set up and had great sound quality. Also the battery life is long - 2 days on a charge - and it fits so well I hardly realize I have it on."
4,Voice activated calls,"I really like the headset now. It took awhile to learn how to do voice activated calls with my old razr. Just hold down the button on the mike arm socket untill it beeps twice, then say the voice name."
2,"Great Headset, Battery & Charging Problems","I used this product and was impressed with the volume. However, the connection for the charger is iffy at best. Mine lasted about two months. Now the battery will not hold a charge. I tried all the memory reduction tricks I know to make this battery last, but to no avail. The price is right, the volume is good, the power button is difficult to use and the battery is gone after a short while. If the power supply was better, I'd buy another one. For now, it's back to the wired headset."
3,Plantronics headset,OK sound and comfortable to use. Battery gets weak after about six hours of stand by and drops on and off.
2,dont work with long hair,"If you're a female, or if you have long hair, you might want to think twice about purchasing this headset. I bought it because it is small and light, but the hook goes on your ear is not designed to work with long hair. My headset pops out easily, just a 2-3 minutes after I put on, it gradually moves upward because my long hair gets in the way. So, you can imagine how painful it is to fuss with it, and trying to make it stay, so I can talk for a few minutes. After trying to put up with it for a week, I gave up. I am looking at other bluetooth headset that works with my Razer and my long hair. :-)"
3,connection snaps,"I got this for my partner. while the voice quality is very good and it is comfy on the ear the sounds are often transferred to the phone (handset) in the middle of the conversation, so we cant hear anything. This has happened with both his handsets."
5,Comfort for our whole family,"We are farmers and use our phones constantly. With new laws in CA we are all getting used to headsets and this is the one that fits all of us, you can hear over most equipment and it is comfortable enough to wear for hours. Great price, comfort, clear reception. Couldn't ask for much more."
3,Good,"The bluetooth was working fine, however it will not charge and I am trying to locate who to contact so it can be repaired or replaced. It was less than 30 days old when he stopped working. Do you know who I can call or email? Thanks."
5,PLANTRONICS VOYAGER 510 BLUETOOTH HEADSET,GREAT VOLUME - GREAT BATTERY LIFE - GREAT TRANSMISSIONS - GREAT PRICE!WATCH OUT YOU DONT GO OVER YOUR LIMIT. KEEPS YOU ON CALLS LONGER AND CAN BE COSTLY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AT $41.00!!!
5,Excellent Bluetooth Headset,"Great sound, great transmission. Lightweight, comfortable. Maybe not the easiest to get on as it curls around the ear...or I'm just challenged. However, once mounted, it's pretty secure!Linking to my LG 8300 cell phone was a breeze."
3,headset is ok,"The bluetooth headset is ok. The only problem I have with it, is its tiring and uncompfortable when wearing for an hour or more. It still has static but much less than my previous bluetooth headset. So, if you can find it for under $40 and you don't mind your ear getting tired, then go ahead and buy it."
4,The best I've used,Flat out this thing is the loudest and clearest bluetooth headset I've ever used. It has two detractors to it and that is why I rated it at four stars instead of five.One the thing is huge and a little goofy looking on your head but then again aren't all headsets?Two the mouth piece is so sensitive that people will hear what you are doing and that can be a bit distracting.All and all though this is a great product. I would Recommend it.
5,It's the best,Great voice clarity. very comfortable around your ear. Fits perfect. Awesome battery life.
2,Nice design but horrible in the wind.,"The Plantronics 510 has nice behind the ear design, so it doesn't feel like its going to fall off easily. However, when outside with my Treo 650 the sound quality is horrible. If you plan to use this headset indoors, then its perfect."
4,A great headset but could be better,"I purchased this headset 2 months ago to upgrade from a previous headset (WMP 200 from Samsung). I purchased it because of the reviews given concerning the clarity of voice communication, and it's true- the sound is clear and no muffling or distortion occurs when I drive on the freeway with my windows down.But a word of caution, the headset has a removable ear piece that you twist and lock for greater ear comfort and sound quality. However, the twisting and locking feature is annoying. You can't remove or place the headset without being extra careful not to twist off the ear piece, especially when it fits snuggly in the ear canal. I have almost lost it multiple times when removing it.Even still, the unit works great and unless you are constantly removing your headset instead of leaving it on, this is a great buy for the price."
4,Good Gadget,"This bluetooth works well with my cell phone. I looks big and bulky, but it fits well on the ear. As a matter of fact, it fits better than all the other bluetoothes I've tried. It's easy to operate and handle. One downside is that it will make loud static if you get too far from your phone."
2,poor sound quality sometimes,does not work very well with my LG VX8300 from verizon. sometimes sound quality is terrible. but hanging up and redial usually gets better. not sure it is problem with my phone or this headset.
5,Plantronics,I have been using my Voyager for over a month and I love it. The sound is clear and the quality is outstanding. Amazon was simple to order from and my unit arrived timely and as expected.
4,"Great, Reliable.....","and loud enough to hear screaming down the Highway in an S4 at 110, with the listener none the wiser - A+"
3,earpiece keeps popping off,"I love this bluetooth except for two things. #1 the damn earpieces keep twisting off the headpiece. I've lost the piece several times and found it. I've tried the three different ear pieces that come with the bluetooth and only one doesn't pop off. #2 If you have small ears like me, this bluetooth barely fits. It falls off fairly regularly. I never realized how small my ears were prior to owning one of these. I wish I could say the same for my waist!"
2,Good at first then went south,I have been using this headset for about 6 months now. At first it was working great but then about a month ago the quality of the voice (transmit) started to degrade. I could hear people fine but they complained that I was always braking up. It finally stopped transmitting about two weeks ago and I am not with out a headset. I plan to get another one but not this one. I hope to find one that can last a bit longer.
4,Almost perfect,"The Plantronics ear piece has almost all bases covered. It is comfortable, clear, blocks regular background noise, and lasts an entire day of heavy use. The only problem is outside with even a whisper of wind. The noise canceler cancels all audio, both directions. Other than that one thing, it is leagues ahead of the Motorola I have passed off to someone else. Purchased a second unit for my wife."
4,Excellent value bluetooth,"This is actually my second purchase of the Plantronics Bluetooth-I bought the first one for my husband & loved it when I tried it out. The sound quality is fantastic, even when he's driving down the road in his big truck. Very comfortable & comes with 3 sizes of earbuds so most everyone can find one to fit. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the on/off button is really tiny. Other than that, save your money & buy this fantastic product!"
5,"Comfortable, High Quality Headset","This is my second Plantronics Voyager 510 Headset. I use it in the office all day. It is very comfortable to wear and has a very good range and voice quality. Now that the price is so low at Amazon, I can't imagine settling for less."
4,VERY COMFORTABLE,"VERY COMFORTABLE BUT CANNOT KEEP A CONNECTION TO MY RAZOR WHEN IT WORKS IT IS GREAT SOUND QUALITY BETTER THAN MOST. AMAZON PRICE GOOD, AND DELIVERY GOOD. TO BE FAIR REVIEWS HAVE TOLD ME THAT MOTOROLA IS A PROBLEM CHILD TO PLANTRONICS IF THEY SOLVE THAT ISSUE THIS WOULD BE UNBEATABLE."
1,Plantronics Voyager 510,Just received this from a Amazon supplier. Nothing they did wrong just a not so good product. I charged this unit and paired with my Motorola Droin. Made several calls and every call the other end said the soung was terrible. On my end even with Max volume you could barely here it. Within 1 hour of using it I boxed it up and shipped it back. I also have a inexpensive Motorola H385 which is great compared to this. Would never buy this brand again
2,Not a fan.,"I'd like to point out I've never tried another Bluetooth headset, perhaps all Bluetooth headsets are terrible quality and this is the best on the market. That being said I did not enjoy this headset. There are a lot more ""what did you say?"" moments on BOTH ends of the phone. I couldn't here her and she couldn't hear me. I was often asked to stop using the headset.However it did work, if both ends spoke loudly and clearly it worked perfectly, but who wants to be that meticulous while talking on the phone?"
3,Interface with CISCO IP Communicator Software,"The Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth headset works well with my cell phone. However when using it with CISCO IP Communicator software running on a PC there was a lot of statics over a phone conversation, even after I made all the adjustments recommended by CISCO.At one time the problem was attributed to pairing, or the headset. Plantronics was very responsive in replacing suspected parts, but nothing seems to eliminate the static. I am currently using the headset with my cell phone."
1,Stopped Working For No Reason,Performance was fine until the device stopped working. No damage to it. Can't say why. I am hopeful that Plantronics will replace it. We'll see.
2,Uncomfortable headset,This headset did not last too long. It died out within a couple of months. First the battery caused problem. It used to get charge for more than 3 hours. Slowly the volume key became loose and stopped working. Now it is just lying waiting to be thrown into the trash.
4,Great product,I would definitely say this is a great product. Clarity is good. Ease of use is good. The only complaint that I do have is that you have to position the earpiece just so in the ear to get it to stay put. However I would say that I would purchase the product again.
1,What a piece of crap!!,This thing worked fine for about a week! Now I have to constantly re-connect it to the phone and battery life is very short!! Spend a little more and get your moneys worth.
5,Butsie,I am well pleased with the product I bought. It keeps me from using my hands to talk to someone especially when driving my car. I recommend it for everyone to buy one of these products.
3,Good for the Value,This wireless headset is good for the value. I don't get many complaints about others not being able to hear me. My only issue is I have smaller ears so I have to have it sit just perfectly so it doesn't fall out of my ear.
4,Works great! But a bit bulky,"I picked this bluethooth up about 6 weeks ago. The upsides to this item are a plenty. The talk and standby time is just about for ever(I charge it twice a week and never turn it off). I can hear well but not as good as my old 520 Voyager that fits inside the ear but this is more comfortable for long talk times. People can hear me better and there is less background and wind noise. The only thing is the bulk really, large back piece is take a little getting use to. And is a bit uncomfortable when wearing sunglasses. But for anyone who talks alot on the phone for work or personal and is in sometimes a area with lots of noises going on this a great pick."
4,Third one and still loving it.,"This is my third Voyager 510 headset--dog at the first one, and if anyone finds the second in the mountains of Colorado, please send it back. For the cost of this device, I have found this headset to be ideal. I am always able to hear without interference, and it seldom falls out once you pick out the right earpiece (comes with three). If this third one gets sucked into the vacuum cleaner, I'd definitely buy another."
4,Fits like a glove,"i am satisfied with the Plantronics Voyager Bluetooth.why i love it:-fits like a glove in my ear-great connection-great soundmy only complaint:-there's no car charger, which isn't very practical, as bluetooths are used mainly for the purpose of hands-free calls while driving"
4,Great headset,"I really like this headset. It's comfortable, and has good sound.I liked it so much I bought one for my dad for his birthday."
5,Plantronics voyager 510,"I gave this product as a gift to my wife a month ago and she really loves it. She said it is very comfortable and the reception has been excellent. It has been a safety item for us and all around her in that she uses it as she drives and is able to keep two hands on the wheel. As of now, no problems have risen and she is very happy with it."
4,super sound quality - noise reduction,"I have tried a minimum of six different bluetooth headsets and this is one of the best. Good volume, great fit with multiple earpieces to choose from, good noise reduction.I would rate this a five but it quit charging and Plantronics is sending another unit.Turn time on the replacement has not been spectacular"
5,strong performance,"The headset is very comfortable and lightweight. Because it is behind the ear it looks much better than the rest of the bluetooth crowd. Plantronics has the best headsets in the business, period."
4,"Good sound, a little tough on the ear","Like many others, I have gone through ""All"" the ranges of BT headsets and still looking for the ideal one. I have numerous higher end units, including Plantronics Discovery 655 but I don't like wearing something pushed inside the ear for extended period of time. Read good reviews of the 510 and liked the design (over the ear) from a comfort perspective so gave it a shot. The sound quality and volume is great (both ways) but the the little ear bud gets irritating quickly (they have the little cloth cushions) -- it would have been perfect if I could attach the soft silicone rubber earbuds that come with the 655. I use it without the cloth cushion and its more bearable. Its my first choice for daily use due to loud volume and clarity and comfort design."
2,"Good, if it would stay on my ear","The sound quality of this headset was very good. However, I had to return it because it would not stay in my hear. It was extremly frustrating because I could not walk with it and found myself tilting my head to the side so it would stay in. Maybe I have abnormally small ears, but I doubt it. I went back to using a different headset that stays in and is easier to turn on and off."
1,Not a good fit,This over-the-ear bluetooth did not fit my small ear. I didn't even try a call & so I can't speak to the quality. I returned the product & went with the Tritton visor clip bluetooth device and love it!
4,"Great Sound Quality, But Awkward","Having owned just about every popular Bluetooth ever made, I have to say that for me Plantronics, has the best overall sound quality, both for talking and listening. I have also owned the sleeker version plantronics makes, which I think I will still call my favorite. Although this bluetooth is very comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is GREAT! It is very clumsy to get on, and the control buttons for volume/on-off, are very difficult to use while on your ear. Also, there is a very noticeable delay, when trying to connect to the phone, or pick up a call, when pressing the button on this bluetooth. I would have given this bluetooth 5 stars, if it wasn't for awkwardness, that comes along with it's sturdy design, and did I mention GREAT sound quality!"
2,Expected Better,"The quality of my voice when talking to others was very poor. They could barely hear me and many made comments about it.The sound of their voice was pretty good, however I need it to be both ways. I tried to adjust the way I was wearing it, but still no solution.I will keep looking..."
4,Satisfied Bluetooth purchaser,"After spending months trying to decide which bluetooth device I would like that I would not have to return, a friend suggested the Plantronics Voyager 510. I am so glad I took his advice! This device is absolutely great. It's easy to set up, comfortable to wear and has other excellent features like mute, volume control and voice dial. This has been the best bluetooth device I have owned to date! I will definitely be keeping this one.,"
5,Good sound and comfortable,"The headset works great, easy to configure, etc. Can have the windows partly down in car and caller can still here me fine.A warning to anyone with a Blackberry (at least an 8700c), make sure you update your system software or the Bluetooth will lose its connection every few minutes. Has nothing to do with the headset."
3,Multipoint Technology - Where?,"I bought this headset specifically for its ability to connect to multiple devices (phone and laptop) at the same time. However, it doesn't seem to, pairing with one device always loses paring with the other. The Plantronics documentation (user guide included with the device as well as what I can find on their web site) doesn't even mention multipoint."
5,Amazon.com needs to update Product information,This is one amazing bluetooth I have used until now and I thank Plantronics for such redifining innovative product. However my concern is about the website having missed something on Product description page. It does not mention if this unit comes with an AC wall charger. I was confused about opening the product pack on seeing no separate packet for the AC charger in the shipment and with no mention on the product box for its contents as well. Although on contacting Amazon customer care I was assured for a full refund of my money because of the ambiguity in here. Another headset from Plantronics (M2500) is mentioned to have a charger included in the price. My request to update the Product information page with details pertaining to the included charger as well. Thanks in advance !
1,Headset always disconnect with my phone & people can't hear from the other line!!!,"This product sucks. I thought is was great the first week I got it. But then it started to do some annoying things. First if I made a call and then try to make another call, the headset just disconnect with my phone and I have to turn the headset off and on to get it connected. I tried talking to some people and would tell me that they can't hear me. When I switch to my phone, they can hear me clearly. This headset is junk. I had an old Motorola H300 and it worked great for me. I never did get disconnected and people can hear me clearly. I'm so sad that I lost it and replaced it with this piece of crap. I'm going back to Motorola and I'm going to throw this garbage away where it belongs."
2,not rugged enough for me,I used the 510 for about two weeks. The mic portion of the unit quit on me. We have a farm-feedlot operation. I didn't want to wear it on my ear all the time. I carry my bluetooth in my front shirt pocket between calls. I found it cumbersome to untwist and place on my right ear (it swivels around to fit either ear). It seems everytime I took it from my pocket it was configured for my left ear. On the plus side it had good volume and they could always hear me.
1,Not Just Bad Really Bad!,"This ear piece has a mind of it's own, sometimes it works but most of the time it doesn't. I don't know if it is incompatible with my phone or just a bad product. When I call someone I can hear them but they cannot hear me, I have to push the button on the ear piece several times before it finally connects or I have to hang up and dial again. Out going calls are a challange for this ear piece receiving calls are fine. I would not recommend this to any one. I have yet to find an ear piece that truely works they way they are supposed to, I guess I will keep looking."
5,A return buyer,I had a motorola earpiece which never stayed on my ear and reception in the car was poor at best. The plantronics 510 offers comfort and great clarity. This is a great earpiece especially given the great price through Amazon.
4,"Works nice, fits nice","The Voyager 510 fits nicely on your ear and even comes with extra pads for more comfort. This is my first Bluetooth headset.I tried it on my Playstation 3 with Warhawk (online action multiplayer with voice chat) and it works, but I couldn't understand much of what anyone was saying. I think this was due to the game's limitations, as I've heard comments online saying the same thing.Pairing was easy once I learned what to do.I used it when I talked to a friend for an hour with my orange LG ENV phone. It worked fine and there were no issues. I stayed mostly near the phone at my desk, so I haven't tested walking away from the phone while talking.Cons: The power button is uncomfortable to press. It's hard plastic and has this point sticking out of it that jams into your thumb.Otherwise, it is nicely designed.Good purchase!"
2,look elsewhere,"Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged]Received this product on a Friday,did initial charge and linked to my phone Sony 810I with no problem,syncing took less than 20 seconds.The headset worked without an issue on Monday,on Tuesday the headset started dialing out the last called number,it wouldn't turn off,I then did a phone disconnect from the headset(I drive a truck therefore I couldn't place it out of range)and it would continually try to sync up the rest of the day.The headset was returned to Amazon and the search goes on."
3,Not as good as wire,"The ear piece is comfortable and the battery life a respectable 5-6 hours, but two issues have made it a second choice that came with the wired ear phone that came with my treo 700. First problem is the bluetooth connectivity is spotty. Many times when a call comes in, pressing the ear piece button does not pick it up, and then annoyingly 2-3 minutes into the conversation, the set kicks in and takes the signal from the handset. The second problem is the hinge that keeps the microphone boom in place. It's loose, and won't stay where I put it. The sound hasn't been affected noticably, but I don't like a limp boom."
4,"so far, so good","This was a replacement earpiece for the same model so I know it works well. So far it's working fine, but I'm a little worried because it said it was in ""retail packaging"" and instead arrived wrapped in plastic & bubblewrapped. I've never seen a retail package quite like that so I'm keeping my fingers crossed."
4,I can hear!,"I've had other bluetooth head sets - I found them uncomfortable to wear and I was always asking people to repeat themselves. This headset fits nicely on my ear - sometimes I forget it's even on! And for the very first time EVER I had to turn the volume down! I only gave it four stars because the volume controls are difficult to get to, but that's a small price to pay for the clarity you get."
2,To Thick,"I found this bluetooth to thick to fit comfortably behind my ear. It is way to thick. When I used it and tried it out, I did enjoy the sound quality but I couldn't wear it."
2,JUST OK,"I was very disappointed in this unit. The volume level does not go high enough. It does not offer voice activated dialing from the headset. The only good thing about the unit is that it fits securely in the ear. I bought this unit because it was a top seller on Amazon. I was disappointed with the purchase. I have a 2nd unit my a diffrent manufactuer that has more features, works far better and for a cheaper price. You can do better than this disappointing product."
5,Bluetooth Headset,Unit is easy to use. It worked the first time and has given very good service to this point. Very comfortable to wear. The over ear design keeps it from moving around. I drive heavy equipment and get bounced around a lot. Device is good to use outdoors.Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged]
2,Problems with sound quality!,"I like certain features on this headset, such as the ability to redial the last number called. But the power button is a bit difficult to work with because it is so small. More importantly, though, people have a hard time hearing me, and I've been told there is a popping sound whenever I'm on it. I accidentally recorded video on my phone once while the headset was still connected, and I could hear the popping sound on the video, too. I have a Nokia 5300, so I'm thinking about replacing this headset with one from Nokia."
3,bluetooth,"This is a good product , but after I received it, the lights stopped working, and so ou cannot be sure if it is charging or not"
5,Good Product,I usually forget I am wearing it. Sounds fine. I get at least 30ft range. Lasts me all day. Short charging time.
4,Impressed,"So far I have really enjoyed this earpiece. At first it was a little tricky to put it on, but now it is comfortable and extremely clear. Also, to date, I have never had to charge it before my actual phone."
3,Ok,"Ok, I have owned this unit for about 8 months and I have to say that the Plantronics Voyager 510 is a good unit but I have problems with answering calls. It has always transferred back to phone when I answer a call. I have tried many different ways of answering, troubleshooted and it still does it. Very frustrating! It could be that it's just not as compatible w/ my LG phone. The noise canceling quality is good, better than most, and battery life is great but I think that I will be looking at a Jawbone next."
5,Freedom at Last,"Enjoy this great headset in my everyday work experience, no more digging for the cell phone while driving. It is so light I don't remember that I have it on. I like the reception and audio out my clients hear me well. I would buy it again!Dave Williams CFP"
3,So-So Amazon,"The headset was described as ""New"" but was clearly used. It wasn't in bad condition--and since I got it over less than half of the retail cost, I kept it. Overall the sound quality is good. Even in the wind people listening on the other end can hear me well. But after a couple of months of wear, the volume control button broke off. I was able to snap it back into place, but it's very tenuous. So now I just control the volume from my phone."
4,Good Headset,"This is my first headset. It has good battery life, sounds good for both me and my caller, and isn't too large. The only thing I don't like about it, which is through no fault of the device, is that it interferes with my sunglasses seating behind my ear. Again, not the fault of the device, just some thing that I din't consider before purchase. Other than that, I would recommend this product."
